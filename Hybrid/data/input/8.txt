20376671	Characterization and fine mapping of the glabrous leaf and hull mutants gl1 in rice Oryza sativa L..	2010	Plant Cell Rep	The glabrous leaf and hull gl1 mutants were isolated from M2 generation of indica cultivar 93-11. These mutants produced smooth leaves and hairless glumes under normal growth conditions. By analyzing through scanning electron microscope, it was revealed that the leaf trichomes, including macro and micro hairs, were deficient in these mutants. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using nine SSR markers and one InDel marker, the gl1 gene was mapped between RM1200 and RM2010 at the short arm of chromosome 5, which was consistent with the mapping of gl1 in previous studies. To facilitate the map-based cloning of the gl1 gene, 12 new InDel markers were developed. A high-resolution genetic and physical map was constructed by using 1,396 mutant individuals of F2 mapping population. Finally, the gl1 was fine mapped in 54-kb region containing 10 annotated genes. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from four gl1 mutants gl1-1, gl1-2, gl1-3 and gl1-4 and four glabrous rice varieties Jackson, Jefferson, Katy and Lemont all showed that the same single point mutation A-->T occurred in the 5'-untranslated region UTR of the locus Os05g0118900 corresponding to the 3'-UTR of STAR2. RT-PCR analysis of the locus Os05g0118900 revealed that its mRNA expression level was normal in gl1 mutant. RNA secondary structure prediction showed that the single point mutation resulted in a striking RNA conformational change. These results suggest that the single point mutation is most likely responsible for the glabrous leaf and hull phenotypes in rice.

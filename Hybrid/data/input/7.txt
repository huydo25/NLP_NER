11448759	Synthesis of hemoglobins in rice Oryza sativa var. Jackson plants growing in normal and stress conditions.	2001	Plant Sci	In rice Oryza sativa var. Jackson at least three copies of hemoglobin hb gene exist. Rice hb1 and hb2 genes are differentially expressed in roots and leaves from mature plants. We used polyclonal antibodies raised to recombinant rice Hb1 and Western blotting to analyze the synthesis of Hbs in rice plants growing under normal or stress conditions. Results showed that rice Hbs are synthesized in coleoptiles, seminal roots and embryos from seeds germinated for 6 days, and also in leaves and roots from plants 2-14 weeks after germination. Analysis of Hb synthesis in stressed rice showed that i level of Hbs was higher in etiolated than control plants, ii level of Hbs increased in roots from flooded rice, and iii level of Hbs did not change under oxidative H2O2, nitrosative SNP and hormonal 2,4-D stresses. These results suggest that the effect of light withdrawal in etiolated leaves and O2-limiting conditions in flooded roots, but not oxidative, nitrosative and hormonal stresses, modulate the synthesis of rice Hbs.

15069599	Marker-assisted selection in segregating generations of self-fertilizing crops.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Computer simulations were used to study the efficiency of MAS for breeding self-fertilizing crops, based on a general model including additive, dominance and epistasis. It was shown that MAS not only gave larger genetic responses but also dramatically increased the frequencies of superior genotypes as compared with phenotypic selection. However, the advantages of MAS over phenotypic selection were considerably reduced when conducting selection in later generations. A modified method combining MAS in early generations with phenotypic selection in later generations was thus proposed from an efficiency standpoint. We also proposed a potential index to measure the probability of an individual showing superior genotypes under selfing. It was apparent that more superior genotypes could be derived from selection by using the potential index than by using other methods. The implications of these findings for plant breeding are discussed.

12012245	Two uncoupling protein genes of rice (Oryza sativa L.): molecular study reveals the defects in the pre-mRNA processing for the heat-generating proteins of the subtropical cereal.	2002	Planta	The recent finding of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in plants has demonstrated that plant mitochondria contain at least two distinct types of potential heat-generating protein, i.e. uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and alternative oxidases. In this study, we isolated and characterized two rice genes encoding UCPs with the aim of improving cold tolerance of rice through the modification of UCP expression. The two rice nuclear genes, OsUCP1 and OsUCP2, appeared to encode functional UCPs, as far as the amino acid sequences of the gene products showed. However, our study revealed that the processing of the pre-mRNAs of both genes was defective. The defects in the pre-mRNA processing resulted in multiple abnormal forms of the transcripts, whose translation products seemed not to retain normal UCP activities. No OsUCP cDNA clones corresponding to the normal transcripts were detected in our study. A northern analysis, on the other hand, revealed that neither of the OsUCP genes exhibited cold-enhanced expression, whereas the gene expression for an alternative oxidase was strikingly enhanced in cold-treated leaves of rice. Our present data thus indicate that rice leaves, placed in cold environments, do not express functional UCPs.
1885617	Molecular cloning and gibberellin-induced expression of multiple cysteine proteinases of rice seeds (oryzains).	1991	J Biol Chem	We screened a cDNA library of germinating rice seeds with a cDNA for aleurain (cysteine proteinase from barley) and obtained three distinct types of cDNA clones encoding three species of cysteine proteinases (oryzains alpha, beta, and gamma). The deduced amino acid sequences are distinct in part, but, on the whole, are similar to one another. The three sequences all contain the catalytic triad Cys25-His159-Asn175 (papain numbering). The three oryzains are similar to one another and also to other known cysteine proteinases such as papain and cathepsin H with respect to the sequences around the active site residues and the COOH-terminal Trp-rich region. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that oryzains alpha and beta are similar not only to each other (70% similarity) but also to actinidin and papain (about 50%), whereas oryzain gamma was rather similar to aleurain (85%) and cathepsin H (60%). Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNAs for the three oryzains are expressed only in seeds, not in shoots or roots, and show different expression profiles during germination and when the seeds are treated with gibberellic acid. Oryzains alpha and gamma are expressed continuously during germination with a maximum expression 5 days from the start of germination, but are present in neither ripening nor ripened seeds. On the other hand, oryzain beta is expressed not only during germination, but also in ripened seeds before germination. It was noted that the expression of the three oryzain mRNAs is enhanced in different manners by gibberellic acid but is not enhanced by other plant hormones such as auxin. The induction of oryzain beta mRNA is transient, reaching a maximum in 4 h from the addition of giberellic acid and diminishing rapidly thereafter, while the induction of oryzain alpha and gamma mRNAs continues over 5 days. Thus, multiple systems involving cysteine proteinases must be differentially involved in the germination process, probably under hormonal control.
16413588	Characterization of a GDP-D-mannose 3'',5''-epimerase from rice.	2006	Phytochemistry	The enzymatic characterization of GDP-d-mannose 3'',5''-epimerase (GME), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of vitamin C in plants is described. The GME gene (Genbank Accession No. AB193582) in rice was cloned, and expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Reaction products from GDP-d-mannose, as produced by GME catalysis, were separated by recycling HPLC on an ODS column, and were determined to be GDP-l-galactose and GDP-l-gulose, based on their NMR spectra and sugar analysis. The reaction catalyzed by GME was inhibited by GDP, and was strongly accelerated by NAD(+) in contrast to the case of GME from Arabidopsis thaliana. This difference in the effect of NAD(+) on GME activity can be attributed to the NAD binding domain which is conserved in the rice gene, but not in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene. The apparent K(m) and k(cat) were determined to be 1.20x10(-5)M and 0.127s(-1), respectively, in the presence of 20microM NAD(+). The fractions of GDP-d-mannose, GDP-l-galactose and GDP-l-gulose, at equilibrium, were approximately 0.75, 0.20 and 0.05, respectively.
9171081	Cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase from the higher plant Chenopodium album.	1997	Nucleic Acids Res	We have cloned a full-length cDNA from the higher plant Chenopodium album coding for a single subunit bacteriophage-type RNA polymerase. The cDNA isolated from an actively growing cell suspension culture recognized a 3.8 kb transcript on Northern blots. The open reading frame comprises 987 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 112 kDa. A comparison of the protein sequence with those of the two known fungal mitochondrial RNA polymerases, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa , reveals extensive homology between the three enzymes. with complete conservation of all catalytically essential amino acids. The putative mitochondrial RNA polymerase from C.album , as well as homologous sequences from rice and barley, which have been partially cloned, lack two catalytically non-essential regions of up to 176 amino acids near the C-terminus present in the two fungal mitochondrial RNA polymerases. The extreme N-terminus of the cloned C.album RNA polymerase displays features of a potential mitochondrial transit sequence. In phylogenetic trees constructed to compare the evolutionary relationships between the different single subunit RNA polymerases the C.album sequence forms a subgroup together with the S.cerevisiae and the N.crassa mitochondrial RNA polymerases, well separating from both bacteriophage enzymes and plasmid-encoded RNA polymerases found in mitochondria of many fungi and some higher plants.
12177502	Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice.	2002	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) anther development is easily damaged by moderately low temperatures above 12 degrees C. Subtractive screening of cDNA that accumulated in 12 degrees C-treated anthers identified a cDNA clone, OsMEK1, encoding a protein with features characteristic of a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase. The putative OsMEK1 protein shows 92% identity to the maize (Zea mays) MEK homolog, ZmMEK1. OsMEK1 transcript levels were induced in rice anthers by 12 degrees C treatment for 48 h. Similar OsMEK1 induction was observed in shoots and roots of seedlings that were treated at 12 degrees C for up to 24 h. It is interesting that no induction of OsMEK1 transcripts was observed in 4 degrees C-treated seedlings. In contrast, rice lip19, encoding a bZIP protein possibly involved in low temperature signal transduction, was not induced by 12 degrees C treatment but was induced by 4 degrees C treatment. Among the three MAP kinase homologs cloned, only OsMAP1 displayed similar 12 degrees C-specific induction pattern as OsMEK1. A yeast two-hybrid system revealed that OsMEK1 interacts with OsMAP1, but not with OsMAP2 and OsMAP3, suggesting that OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 probably function in the same signaling pathway. An in-gel assay of protein kinase activity revealed that a protein kinase (approximately 43 kD), which preferentially uses myelin basic protein as a substrate, was activated by 12 degrees C treatment but not by 4 degrees C treatment. Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress.

15299118	Identification of syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase reveals functional clustering of terpene synthases involved in rice phytoalexin/allelochemical biosynthesis.	2004	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces momilactone diterpenoids as both phytoalexins and allelochemicals. Accordingly, the committed step in biosynthesis of these natural products is catalyzed by the class I terpene synthase that converts syn-copalyl diphosphate to the corresponding polycyclic hydrocarbon intermediate syn-pimara-7,15-diene. Here, a functional genomics approach was utilized to identify a syn-copalyl diphosphate specific 9beta-pimara-7,15-diene synthase (OsDTS2). To our knowledge, this is the first identified terpene synthase with this particular substrate stereoselectivity and, by comparison with the previously described and closely related ent-copalyl diphosphate specific cassa-12,15-diene synthase (OsDTC1), provides a model system for investigating the enzymatic determinants underlying the observed difference in substrate specificity. Further, OsDTS2 mRNA in leaves is up-regulated by conditions that stimulate phytoalexin biosynthesis but is constitutively expressed in roots, where momilactones are constantly synthesized as allelochemicals. Therefore, transcription of OsDTS2 seems to be an important regulatory point for controlling production of these defensive compounds. Finally, the gene identified here as OsDTS2 has previously been mapped at 14.3 cM on chromosome 4. The class II terpene synthase producing syn-copalyl diphosphate from the universal diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate was also mapped to this same region. These genes catalyze sequential cyclization steps in momilactone biosynthesis and seem to have been evolutionarily coupled by physical linkage and resulting cosegregation. Further, the observed correlation between physical proximity and common metabolic function indicates that other such class I and class II terpene synthase gene clusters may similarly catalyze consecutive reactions in shared biosynthetic pathways.
2535550	Expression of rice lectin is governed by two temporally and spatially regulated mRNAs in developing embryos.	1989	Plant Cell	Two cDNA clones encoding rice lectin have been isolated and characterized to investigate the expression of rice lectin at the molecular and cellular levels. The two cDNA clones code for an identical 23-kilodalton protein which is processed to the mature polypeptide of 18 kilodaltons by co-translational cleavage of a 2.6-kilodalton signal sequence and selective removal of a 2.7-kilodalton COOH-terminal peptide which contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site. In addition, the mature 18-kilodalton lectin is post-translationally cleaved between residues 94 and 95 to yield polypeptides of 10 kilodaltons and 8 kilodaltons, corresponding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal portions of the mature subunit, respectively. RNA gel blot analysis established that rice lectin is encoded by two mRNA transcripts (0.9 kilobase and 1.1 kilobase). On DNA gel blots, the rice lectin cDNAs hybridize specifically to a single restriction fragment. In situ hybridization showed localization of the 1.1-kilobase rice lectin mRNA in root caps and specific cell layers of the radicle, coleorhiza, scutellum, and coleoptile. RNA gel blot analysis demonstrated that both the 0.9-kilobase and 1.1-kilobase mRNAs are present in developing rice embryos. The two lectin mRNAs are differentially expressed temporally such that the 1.1-kilobase lectin mRNA accumulates to levels twofold higher than the 0.9-kilobase mRNA.
11779837	Athila4 of Arabidopsis and Calypso of soybean define a lineage of endogenous plant retroviruses.	2002	Genome Res	The Athila retroelements of Arabidopsis thaliana encode a putative envelope gene, suggesting that they are infectious retroviruses. Because most insertions are highly degenerate, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the A. thaliana genome sequence to discern their conserved features. One family (Athila4) was identified whose members are largely intact and share >94% nucleotide identity. As a basis for comparison, related elements (the Calypso elements) were characterized from soybean. Consensus Calypso and Athila4 elements are 12-14 kb in length and have long terminal repeats of 1.3-1.8 kb. Gag and Pol are encoded on a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1801 (Calypso) and 1911 (Athila4) amino acids. Following the Gag-Pol ORF are noncoding regions of ~0.7 and 2 kb, which, respectively, flank the env-like gene. The env-like ORF begins with a putative splice acceptor site and encodes a protein with a predicted central transmembrane domain, similar to retroviral env genes. RNA of Athila elements was detected in an A. thaliana strain with decreased DNA methylation (ddm1). Additionally, a PCR survey identified related reverse transcriptases in diverse angiosperm genomes. Their ubiquitous nature and the potential for horizontal transfer by infection implicates these endogenous retroviruses as important vehicles for plant genome evolution.
15037733	Composition and structure of the centromeric region of rice chromosome 8.	2004	Plant Cell	Understanding the organization of eukaryotic centromeres has both fundamental and applied importance because of their roles in chromosome segregation, karyotypic stability, and artificial chromosome-based cloning and expression vectors. Using clone-by-clone sequencing methodology, we obtained the complete genomic sequence of the centromeric region of rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 8. Analysis of 1.97 Mb of contiguous nucleotide sequence revealed three large clusters of CentO satellite repeats (68.5 kb of 155-bp repeats) and >220 transposable element (TE)-related sequences; together, these account for approximately 60% of this centromeric region. The 155-bp repeats were tandemly arrayed head to tail within the clusters, which had different orientations and were interrupted by TE-related sequences. The individual 155-bp CentO satellite repeats showed frequent transitions and transversions at eight nucleotide positions. The 40 TE elements with highly conserved sequences were mostly gypsy-type retrotransposons. Furthermore, 48 genes, showing high BLAST homology to known proteins or to rice full-length cDNAs, were predicted within the region; some were close to the CentO clusters. We then performed a genome-wide survey of the sequences and organization of CentO and RIRE7 families. Our study provides the complete sequence of a centromeric region from either plants or animals and likely will provide insight into the evolutionary and functional analysis of plant centromeres.
12909345	Cloning and characterization of rice HMGB1 gene.	2003	Gene	We isolated a 918 bp long full-length rice HMGB1 cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 471 bp encoding 157 amino acids, with a central domain of high sequence similarity to the HMG-box domain of other plant HMGB1 proteins. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that rice HMGB1 gene is constitutively expressed in various tissues and organs. Southern hybridization and sequence analyses suggested that a single copy of the HMGB1 gene composed of seven exons and six introns exists in rice. We have also cloned a 1755 bp long 5' flanking region of the rice HMGB1 gene, which can be regarded as its promoter. 5' deletion analysis of this promoter indicated that positive cis-elements residing between -1400 and -1115 are important to enhance quantitative expression, whereas negative cis-elements between -1755 and -1400 and between -1115 and -351 inhibit expression.
12590928	Rice HMGB1 protein recognizes DNA structures and bends DNA efficiently.	2003	Arch Biochem Biophys	We analyzed the DNA-binding and DNA-bending properties of recombinant HMGB1 proteins based on a rice HMGB1 cDNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that rice HMGB1 can bind synthetic four-way junction (4H) DNA and DNA minicircles efficiently but the binding to 4H can be completed out by HMGA and histone H1. Conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism analysis with 4H DNA bound to various concentrations of HMGB1 or its truncated forms. T4 ligase-mediated circularization assays with short DNA fragments of 123 bp showed that the protein is capable of increasing DNA flexibility. The 123-bp DNA formed closed circular monomers efficiently in its presence, similar to that in an earlier study on maize HMG. Additionally, our results show for the first time that the basic N-terminal domain enhances the affinity of the plant HMGB1 protein for 4H DNA, while the acidic C-terminal domain has the converse effects.

10470849	A novel calmodulin-like protein gene in rice which has an unusual prolonged C-terminal sequence carrying a putative prenylation site.	1999	DNA Res	A rice cDNA encoding a novel calmodulin-like protein was identified. It has 38 additional amino acids at the C-terminus of a complete, typical calmodulin (CaM) sequence of 149 amino acids. The four C-terminal amino acid residues form a CAAL motif which could be a site for protein prenylation and may subsequently cause the protein to become membrane associated. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that such a combined protein gene truly exists in rice. Sequence analysis of its genomic counterpart showed that there is an intron located at junction of the normal CaM sequence and the 38 C-terminal amino acids. This introduces a potential stop codon for normal CaM if an alternative splicing mechanism is involved. Southern blot analysis of rice genomic DNA revealed that there is only one locus for this gene. The northern blot analysis showed that this gene is highly expressed in rice roots, shoots and flowers. The distribution of this protein demonstrates the functional importance of this novel CaM-like protein in rice.

2562760	Rice alcohol dehydrogenase genes: anaerobic induction, organ specific expression and characterization of cDNA clones.	1989	Plant Mol Biol	Anaerobiosis rapidly induces alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme of the fermentation pathway, in different parts of rice seedlings. After initiation of anaerobiosis, the activity of the enzyme increases linearly for 3 days or more. The ADH activity is anaerobically inducible even in mature rice leaves in contrast to maize which shows no induction in mature leaves. Rice ADH activity can also be induced by an auxin analog, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, under aerobic conditions. The experimental results show that anaerobiosis increases the ADH mRNA level, indicating that the ADH enzyme is regulated at the transcriptional level. Starch gel electrophoresis of a protein extract from rice shows 3 distinct forms of ADH. The amounts of the 3 forms vary with the organ, suggesting that the expression of ADH genes is organ-specific. Sequencing data show that the two different cloned cDNA copies of ADH mRNAs are derived from two different genes.
2332167	Molecular analysis of an alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding genomic clone (adh2) from rice.	1990	Gene	An alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene was isolated from a rice genomic library. The coding region was sequenced, and the gene was identified as adh2. The nucleotide sequence of this gene contains an open reading frame which is interrupted by nine introns. Sequences that are important for eukaryotic gene expression, e.g. the TATA box, polyadenylation signal, intron/exon junction and putative splicing branch sites, are found in the expected locations in the rice adh2. A sequence related to the hexanucleotide core of regulatory elements identified in anaerobically induced plant genes is also present in the 5' region of the rice adh2.
12615946	Disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance in rice are inversely modulated by an abscisic acid-inducible mitogen-activated protein kinase.	2003	Plant Cell	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play an important role in mediating stress responses in eukaryotic organisms. However, little is known about the role of MAPKs in modulating the interaction of defense pathways activated by biotic and abiotic factors. In this study, we have isolated and functionally characterized a stress-responsive MAPK gene (OsMAPK5) from rice. OsMAPK5 is a single-copy gene but can generate at least two differentially spliced transcripts. The OsMAPK5 gene, its protein, and kinase activity were inducible by abscisic acid as well as various biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (wounding, drought, salt, and cold) stresses. To determine its biological function, we generated and analyzed transgenic rice plants with overexpression (using the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus) or suppression (using double-stranded RNA interference [dsRNAi]) of OsMAPK5. Interestingly, suppression of OsMAPK5 expression and its kinase activity resulted in the constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1 and PR10 in the dsRNAi transgenic plants and significantly enhanced resistance to fungal (Magnaporthe grisea) and bacterial (Burkholderia glumae) pathogens. However, these same dsRNAi lines had significant reductions in drought, salt, and cold tolerance. By contrast, overexpression lines exhibited increased OsMAPK5 kinase activity and increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses. These results strongly suggest that OsMAPK5 can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance and negatively modulate PR gene expression and broad-spectrum disease resistance.
7590339	Cloning, expression and immunological characterization of Ory s 1, the major allergen of rice pollen.	1995	Gene	We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, Ory s 1, encoding a group-1 allergen of rice pollen. The Ory s 1 protein shows significant sequence identity to the major allergen of rye-grass pollen, Lol p 1. RNA gel blot analysis shows that the Ory s 1 gene is expressed in mature anthers, but not in vegetative or other floral tissues tested. Southern blot analysis indicates that this clone represents a member of a small gene family in rice. Western blot analyses of total rice pollen proteins with the group-1 allergen-specific monoclonal 3A2 and IgE antibodies from grass pollen-allergic patients, revealed the presence of cross-reactive antigenic and allergenic epitopes in Ory s 1.
15255861	Functional identification of rice syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase and its role in initiating biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexin/allelopathic natural products.	2004	Plant J	Rice produces a number of phytoalexins, and at least one allelopathic agent, from syn-copalyl diphosphate (CPP), representing the only known metabolic fate for this compound. Thus, the class II terpene synthase that converts the universal diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate to syn-CPP catalyzes the committed step in biosynthesis of these natural products. Here the extensive sequence information available for rice was coupled to recombinant expression and functional analysis to identify syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPSsyn). In addition, OsCPSsyn mRNA was found to be specifically induced in leaves by conditions that stimulate phytoalexin biosynthesis. Therefore, transcription of OsCPSsyn seems to be an important regulatory point for controlling the production of these defensive compounds. Finally, alignments carried out with OsCPSsyn revealed that class II terpene synthases exhibit a sequence conservation pattern substantially different from that of the prototypical class I enzymes. One particularly notable feature is the specific conservation of the functionally cryptic 'insertional' sequence element in class II terpene synthases, indicating that this region is important for the corresponding cyclization reaction.
8278510	Cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase is a single gene in rice.	1993	Plant Physiol	A cDNA clone encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), an important glycolytic enzyme, was isolated and characterized. The clone (pRTPI-6) contains an open reading frame of 759 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide chain of 253 amino acid residues (M(r) 27,060). The identity of this clone was defined by its high homology (85% nucleotide sequence and 89% amino acid sequence identical match) with a maize mRNA sequence encoding the cytosolic TPI and with TPIs from other species. Genomic DNA blot analysis using the cDNA as a probe showed that the cytosolic TPI gene is present as a single copy per haploid rice genome, as opposed to that found in maize, in which multiple TPI gene copies exist. A single TPI mRNA species of about 1100 nucleotides was detected by gel blot hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from root, culm, and leaf tissues, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous. Based on sequence comparison and molecular analysis, we propose that the chloroplast-located TPI may be encoded by divergent structural nuclear genes in rice.

7888615	Characterization of a rice gene family encoding root-specific proteins.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Two cDNA clones (RCc2 and RCc3) corresponding to mRNAs highly expressed only in root tissues of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were characterized. Respectively, they encode polypeptides of 146 (14.5 kDa) and 133 amino acids (13.4 kDa) that share high (> 70%) sequence similarity with a polypeptide encoded by a cDNA (ZRP3) encoding an mRNA preferentially expressed in young maize roots. Genomic DNA blot analysis revealed that they are members of a small gene family and RCg2, the gene corresponding to RCc2, was isolated. A 1656 bp 5'-upstream sequence of RCg2 was translationally fused to a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and stable introduction of the chimeric construct into rice was confirmed by PCR and genomic DNA blot analyses. Histochemical analysis of transgenic rice plants containing the full-length chimeric gene showed high levels of GUS activity in mature cells and the elongation and maturation zones of primary and secondary roots, and in the root caps, but no GUS activity was detected in root meristematic regions. Surprisingly, high GUS activity was also detected in leaves of the same plants. This raises the possibility that the RCg2 5'-upstream element may not be sufficient for the proper spatial control of root specificity in transgenic rice.
8605293	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	Plant Mol Biol	A new basic chitinase gene, designated RC24, was isolated from a rice genomic library. The predicted RC24 protein contains 322 amino acid residues and exhibits 68% to 95% amino acid identity with known class I rice chitinases. RC24 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited chitinase activity and strongly inhibited bacterial growth. Two transcription start sites of the RC24 gene were mapped by primer extension analysis of both rice native RNA and in vitro transcribed RNA using a RC24 promoter/GUS (beta-glucuronidase) gene fusion as a template. The 5'-flanking region of RC24 contained several putative stress-responsive cis-acting elements. A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues. RC24 transcripts rapidly accumulated within 1 h after fungal elicitor treatment of suspension-cultured cells, and the levels continued to increase for at least 9 h. RC24 transcript accumulation was also observed in intact leaf tissues upon wounding, Transgenic rice plants containing the RC24/GUS gene fusion further confirmed that the RC24 gene showed a tissue-specific expression pattern and that transcription of the RC24 propmoter was sensitively and rapidly activated by wounding.

11055401	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cDNA and a gene for subtilisin-like serine proteases from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana.	2000	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The complete nucleotide sequences of a cDNA (RSP1) that encodes a subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and a gene (ASP48) for Arabidopsis subtilase were analyzed. The RSPI cDNA and ASP48 DNA encoded 736- and 757-residue pre-pro-polypeptides including a signal peptide with molecular masses of 78,668 Da and 79,414 Da, respectively. RSP1 is the first known serine protease in rice, and ASP48 is a gene for ara12 cDNA. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that RSP1 is distantly related to all other plant subtilases and ASP48 is closely related to a tomato subtilase, SBT1. The ASP48 gene was found to lack introns. The Arabidopsis subtilase gene appears to consist of a small gene family. The RSP1 was found to be expressed in seed and shoots of seedlings while ASP48 transcripts was found to be accumulated in immature silique and flowers, indicating that both RSP1 and ASP48 are organ-specific and may be involved in the specific proteolytic events that occur during organ development.
12162569	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel beta-1,3-glucanase gene from rice.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Beta-1,3-glucanases are referred to as pathogenesis-related proteins and they are also involved in several developmental processes. We isolated a cDNA for beta-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Osg1 belonged to monocotyledonous endo-beta-1,3-glucanase subgroup A. RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers.
14729915	The YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF regulates carpel specification and midrib development in Oryza sativa.	2004	Plant Cell	In this article, we report that carpel specification in the Oryza sativa (rice) flower is regulated by the floral homeotic gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) that is distinct from the well-known ABC genes. Severe loss-of-function mutations of DL cause complete homeotic transformation of carpels into stamens. Molecular cloning reveals that DL is a member of the YABBY gene family and is closely related to the CRABS CLAW (CRC) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. DL is expressed in the presumptive region (carpel anlagen), where carpel primordia would initiate, and in carpel primordia. These results suggest that carpel specification is regulated by DL in rice flower development. Whereas CRC plays only a partial role in carpel identity, DL may have been recruited to have the more essential function of specifying carpels during the evolution of rice. We also show that DL interacts antagonistically with class B genes and controls floral meristem determinacy. In addition, severe and weak dl alleles fail to form a midrib in the leaf. The phenotypic analysis of dl mutants, together with analyses of the spatial expression patterns and ectopic expression of DL, demonstrate that DL regulates midrib formation by promoting cell proliferation in the central region of the rice leaf.
15215597	cDNA microarray analysis of rice anther genes under chilling stress at the microsporogenesis stage revealed two genes with DNA transposon Castaway in the 5'-flanking region.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rice is most chilling sensitive at the onset of microspore release. Chilling treatment at this stage causes male sterility. The gene expression profile during the microspore development process under chilling stress was revealed using a microarray that included 8,987 rice cDNAs. As many as 160 cDNAs were up- or down-regulated by chilling during the microspore release stage. RT-PCR analysis of 5 genes confirmed the microarray results. We identified 3 novel genes whose expression levels were remarkably changed by chilling in rice anther. A new cis element that includes a DNA transposon Castaway sequence was found in the 5' upstream region of two genes which were conspicuously down-regulated by chilling temperatures in rice anther.
14733924	Characterization of Rad6 from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its interaction with Sgt1, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex.	2004	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	We report here the existence of interactions between a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsRad6), and Sgt1 (OsSgt1), a novel subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Rad6 is not only related to post-replicational repair but also to the proteasome system, while Sgt1 has a function in kinetochore assembly. The relationship between the two is unexpected, but of great interest. The open reading frames of OsRad6 and OsSgt1 encode predicted products of 152 and 367 amino acid residues, respectively, with molecular weights of 17.3 and 40.9kDa. Two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicated that OsRad6 binds to OsSgt1, and transcripts of both OsRad6 and OsSgt1 were found to be strongly expressed only in the proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem, suggesting that their expression is cell cycle-dependent. The amount of the Rad6 mRNA in cultured cells increased rapidly after division was halted, and mRNA levels of Rad6 and Sgt1 were induced by UV- and DNA-damaging agents such as MMS or H(2)O(2). The Rad6 pathway for repair or the proteasome system may thus require Sgt1 as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
12032317	A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	A rice spotted leaf (lesion-mimic) gene, Spl7, was identified by map-based cloning. High-resolution mapping with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers enabled us to define a genomic region of 3 kb as a candidate for Spl7. We found one ORF that showed high similarity to a heat stress transcription factor (HSF). Transgenic analysis verified the function of the candidate gene for Spl7: leaf spot development was suppressed in spl7 mutants with a wild-type Spl7 transgene. Thus, we conclude that Spl7 encodes the HSF protein. The transcript of spl7 was observed in mutant plants. The levels of mRNAs (Spl7 in wild type and spl7 in mutant) increased under heat stress. Sequence analysis revealed only one base substitution in the HSF DNA-binding domain of the mutant allele, causing a change from tryptophan to cysteine.
12471446	Cereal genes similar to Snf2 define a new subfamily that includes human and mouse genes.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	Genes from the SNF2 family play important roles in transcriptional regulation, maintenance of chromosome integrity and DNA repair. This study describes the molecular cloning and characterization of cereal genes from this family. The predicted proteins exhibit a novel C-terminal domain that defines a new subfamily designated SNF2P that includes human and mouse proteins. Comparison between genomic and cDNA sequences showed that cereal Snf2P genes consisted of 17 exons, including one only 8 bp long. Two barley alleles differed by the presence of a 7.7-kb non-LTR retrotransposon in intron 6. An alternative annotation of the orthologous Arabidopsis gene would improve its similarity with the other members of the subfamily. Intron 2 was not spliced out in approximately half of the rice Snf2P mRNAs present in leaves, resulting in a premature stop codon. Transcripts from the barley and wheat Snf2P genes were found in apexes, leaves, sheaths, roots and spikes. The Snf2P genes exist as single copies on wheat chromosome arm 5A(m)L and in the colinear regions on barley chromosome arm 4HL and rice chromosome 3. High-density genetic mapping and RT-PCR suggest that Snf2P is not a candidate gene for the tightly linked vernalization gene Vrn2.
11572990	Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice. The cloned 6,227-bp-long Reb gene is composed of six exons and five introns and is flanked by a 1.2-kb 5' promoter and a 1.2-kb 3' terminator region. The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system. The effector constructs containing the native gene or fusion genes linking Reb to the rice actin (Act) or globulin (Glb) gene promoters and the reporter gene construct Glb-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) were used in this study. When these effector constructs were cotransferred with the reporter uidA gene encoding GUS under the control of the Glb promoter into immature rice endosperm cells, the Glb promoter was activated. The transient GUS expression was 2.0 to 2.5-fold higher with the effector construct than without. When the upstream activation sequence containing the GCCACGT(A/C)AG motifs of the Glb promoter was deleted, the activation by REB was abolished. On the other hand, a gain-of-function experiment showed that inserting the upstream activation sequence into the glutelin-1 (Gt1) promoter made it responsive to activation by REB. When cotransformed with Reb gene, mature transgenic rice grains containing the human lysozyme gene driven by the Glb promoter produced 3.7-fold more lysozyme. Accumulation of recombinant lysozyme in mature seed ranged from 30.57 to 279.61 microg.mg(-1) total soluble protein in individual transformants from 30 independent transformation events. Thus, our results show that REB is not only a transcriptional activator, it can also be used to increase the expression of recombinant protein in transgenic rice grains.
15061077	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings.	2004	Plant Physiol Biochem	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroids essential for normal growth and development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which BRs regulate the growth and development of plants, it is necessary to identify and analyze more genes that are regulated by BRs. A novel brassinolide (BL)-enhanced gene designated OsBLE1, which was originally identified by using rice (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA microarray, was cloned and characterized. Its cDNA is 598 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide with 81 amino acid residues. Northern blots analysis revealed that OsBLE1 expression began to increase at 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h after BL treatment. OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression. OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial. Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE1 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth. Results suggest that OsBLE1 might be involved in BL-regulated growth processes in rice seedlings.
11713671	Kiddo, a new transposable element family closely associated with rice genes.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	The promoter region of the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) gene was found to be polymorphic between japonica (T309) and indica (IR24) lines as the result of a 270-bp deletion in T309. A TTATA footprint in the T309 rubq2 promoter suggested that an excision event had occurred, and inspection of the 270-bp region present in IR24 revealed that it had all the characteristics of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE). Database searches showed that this element is a member of a new MITE family, which we have named Kiddo. Thirty-five complete Kiddo sequences were identified in existing rice genomic sequence databases. They could be arranged into four groups, within-group sequence identity was over 90%, with 65-75% identity between groups. The high sequence similarity within a group indicates that some Kiddo members were recently mobile and may still be active. An additional 24 decayed Kiddo sequences were detected. Interestingly, approximately 80% of 18 Kiddo members from annotated accessions lie within 530 bp of a coding sequence. That approximately 40% of Kiddo members present in genic regions reside in introns suggests that Kiddo transposition entails the use of both DNA and RNA intermediates, and may provide some insight into the origins of individual groups. DNA blot analysis showed that Kiddo is a rice-specific element, although one sequence with limited (72%) similarity to Kiddo group A was detected as a wheat EST. Kiddo family members may represent new molecular and phylogenetic markers, as well as representing valuable materials for studying the molecular mechanisms of MITE transposition.
13677471	A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are growth-promoting natural substances required for normal plant growth and development. To understand the molecular mechanism of BR action, a cDNA microarray containing 1265 rice genes was analyzed for expression differences in rice lamina joint treated with brassinolide (BL). A novel BL-enhanced gene, designated OsBLE2, was identified and cloned. The full-length cDNA is 3243 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 761 amino acid residues and nine possible transmembrane regions. OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings. Besides, auxin and gibberellins also increased its expression. OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation. Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE2 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth. BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1 . BL effect in the d1 mutant rice was much weaker than that in its wild-type control, indicating that heterotrimeric G protein may be a component of BRs signaling. These results suggest that OsBLE2 is involved in BL-regulated growth and development processes in rice.
15805485	A two-edged role for the transposable element Kiddo in the rice ubiquitin2 promoter.	2005	Plant Cell	Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are thought to be a driving force for genome evolution. Although numerous MITEs are found associated with genes, little is known about their function in gene regulation. Whereas the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) promoter in rice (Oryza sativa) line IR24 contains two nested MITEs (Kiddo and MDM1), that in line T309 has lost Kiddo, providing an opportunity to understand the role of MITEs in promoter function. No difference in endogenous rubq2 transcript levels between T309 and IR24 was evident using RT-PCR. However, promoter analysis using both transient and stably transformed calli revealed that Kiddo contributed some 20% of the total expression. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the rubq2 promoters revealed specific DNA methylation at both symmetric and asymmetric cytosine residues on the MITE sequences, possibly induced by low levels of homologous transcripts. When methylation of the MITEs was blocked by 5-azacytidine treatment, a threefold increase in the endogenous rubq2 transcript level was detected in IR24 compared with that in T309. Together with the observed MITE methylation pattern, the detection of low levels of transcripts, but not small RNAs, corresponding to Kiddo and MDM1 suggested that RNA-dependent DNA methylation is induced by MITE transcripts. We conclude that, although Kiddo enhances transcription from the rubq2 promoter, this effect is mitigated by sequence-specific epigenetic modification.
10557360	Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha, a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytosulfokine-alpha [PSK-alpha, Tyr(SO(3)H)-Ile-Tyr(SO(3)H)-Thr-Gln], a sulfated mitogenic peptide found in plants, strongly promotes proliferation of plant cells in culture at very low concentrations. Oryza sativa PSK (OsPSK) cDNA encoding a PSK-alpha precursor has been isolated. The cDNA is 725 base pairs long, and the 89-aa product, preprophytosulfokine, has a 22-aa hydrophobic region that resembles a cleavable leader peptide at its NH(2) terminus. The PSK-alpha sequence occurs only once within the precursor, close to the COOH terminus. [Ser(4)]PSK-alpha was secreted by transgenic rice Oc cells harboring a mutated OsPSK cDNA, suggesting proteolytic processing from the larger precursor, a feature commonly found in animal systems. Whereas PSK-alpha in conditioned medium with sense transgenic Oc cells was 1.6 times as concentrated as in the control case, antisense transgenic Oc cells produced less than 60% of the control level. Preprophytosulfokine mRNA was detected at an elevated constitutive level in rice Oc culture cells on RNA blot analysis. Although PSK-alpha molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-alpha may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. DNA blot analysis demonstrated that OsPSK homologs may occur in dicot as well as monocot plants.
11198424	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor. Southern blot analysis suggested that OsPSK is a single-copy gene in rice, which we have isolated and characterized. The OsPSK gene consists of one large intron and two exons. The 5-amino acid PSK-alpha sequence located close to the COOH-terminus of the precursor is encoded in the second exon. A putative TATA box was found at position -68 with respect to the transcription initiation site. Upstream of this sequence, several potential regulatory elements, including one CAAT-box, three CCAAT-boxes, one enhancer core-like sequence, and three E-boxes could be identified. By constructing plasmids with various lengths of the 5'-upstream regions of the OsPSK gene fused to the coding sequence for bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS), we demonstrated a region 1.9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation point, which contains most of the putative 5'-regulatory elements, to be sufficient for maximal-level GUS expression in transformed rice Oc cells. The promoter of the OsPSK gene gave significantly higher levels of GUS expression than the CaMV 35S promoter. These results suggest that the OsPSK promoter could be useful for the constitutive expression of a foreign gene at high levels in transformed rice culture cells. Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin.
12369615	The OsEBP-89 gene of rice encodes a putative EREBP transcription factor and is temporally expressed in developing endosperm and intercalary meristem.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	The AP2/EREBP transcription factors play important roles in plant development and in the responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. All members of the EREBP subfamily described to date are from dicotyledonous plants. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsEBP-89, encoding a protein 326 amino acids long with a typical EREBP domain; this is the first report of an EREBP transcription factor in a monocotyledonous plant. Except for the EREBP domain, the OsEBP-89 protein does not have substantial sequence similarities to other members of the subfamily. The DNA-binding activity of the EREBP domain was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. An activation domain rich in acidic amino acids was identified by using a yeast one-hybrid system. Two putative nuclear-localization signals were also identified. The results of northern blot hybridization experiments showed that the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene accumulates primarily in immature seeds, roots, and leaves (low levels). More detailed information about the pattern of OsEBP-89 gene expression was obtained by histochemical studies of transgenic rice plants carrying an OsEBP-89 5'/GUS reporter gene. The reporter gene was expressed in the endosperm starting at 7 days after pollination and in the intercalary meristem of plants. Expression of OsEBP-89 was induced in roots of rice seedlings by treatment with ACC, NaCl, or 2,4-D. Two cis-acting elements, an endosperm motif and a primary PERE, are present upstream of the OsEBP-89 coding region and may be involved in regulating its expression. Collectively, these results suggest that the OsEBP-89 gene is a new member of the EREBP subfamily and may be involved in ethylene-dependent seed maturation and shoot development of rice.
12091716	OSTF1: a HD-GL2 family homeobox gene is developmentally regulated during early embryogenesis in rice.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	In many eukaryotic organisms, homeobox genes are important regulators that specify the cell fate and body plan in early embryogenesis. In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 (Oryza sativa transcription factor 1) encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized. The encoded OSTF1, although sharing only approximately 51% sequence identity with other HD-GL2 members, contains four characteristic motifs (an N-terminal acidic region, a homeodomain, a truncated leucine zipper, and a START domain). OSTF1 was detected as a single copy gene in rice. The transcripts were absent in young panicle or mature spikelet before anthesis, but appeared very early in the pollinated grain with a transient profile. In vegetative tissues examined, expression was only detectable in root. In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3-6 d after pollination. Expression was also detectable in the integument and throughout the endosperm. Although OSTF1 is not closely related to the remaining HD-GL2 members in sequences, this gene exhibits an analogous epidermis-preferential expression pattern.
8260630	Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK, EC 2.7.4.6). The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice NDK shows highest homology to spinach NDK-I. The rice NDK gene exhibits a strong codon bias (73.8% GC) in the third position of the codon. DNA blot analysis indicated that at least single NDK gene is present in rice genome.
11148291	Hd1, a major photoperiod sensitivity quantitative trait locus in rice, is closely related to the Arabidopsis flowering time gene CONSTANS.	2000	Plant Cell	A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling response to photoperiod, Hd1, was identified by means of a map-based cloning strategy. High-resolution mapping using 1505 segregants enabled us to define a genomic region of approximately 12 kb as a candidate for Hd1. Further analysis revealed that the Hd1 QTL corresponds to a gene that is a homolog of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis. Sequencing analysis revealed a 43-bp deletion in the first exon of the photoperiod sensitivity 1 (se1) mutant HS66 and a 433-bp insertion in the intron in mutant HS110. Se1 is allelic to the Hd1 QTL, as determined by analysis of two se1 mutants, HS66 and HS110. Genetic complementation analysis proved the function of the candidate gene. The amount of Hd1 mRNA was not greatly affected by a change in length of the photoperiod. We suggest that Hd1 functions in the promotion of heading under short-day conditions and in inhibition under long-day conditions.
14754915	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions.	2004	J Exp Bot	Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice. The genomic structure of OS-ERS1 and OS-ERS2 revealed that the introns within the coding sequences occurred in conserved positions to those of At-ETR1 and At-ERS1, whereas each of the OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 genes contained 1 intron within its coding region located at a position equivalent to those of At-ERS2, At-ETR2, and At-EIN4. Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species. Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions. Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2). However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene. Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice. Moreover, higher levels of these three mRNAs were commonly observed in anthers when compared with their corresponding levels in other tissues, suggesting the important role played by ethylene involved in the regulation of pollen development in rice. Among the five ethylene receptor genes, the expression levels of both OS-ETR3 and OS-ETR4 were too low to be detected by the northern blot analysis. Results from RT-PCR illustrated that both mRNAs were present in young green rice seedlings and anthers.
15078336	Development of an efficient method for the isolation of factors involved in gene transcription during rice embryo development.	2004	Plant J	Summary An efficient yeast-based system was developed for the isolation of plant cDNAs encoding transcription factors (TFs) and proteins with transcription activation functions (co-activators). The system consists of two vectors: (i) a reporter vector (pG221) harboring the iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) core promoter and the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene; and (ii) a cDNA library construction vector (pYF503), which yields a library of plant peptides fused to the GAL4-binding domain (GAL4-BD). Expression of a peptide harboring the characteristics of a transcriptional activator leads to expression of lacZ, allowing for selection of relevant colonies. TFs during rice embryo development were isolated through this system. Approximately 200 confirmed positive colonies were obtained from screening 10(6) yeast colonies, and sequence analysis of conserved domains identified 75 independent cDNAs, 20 of which encoded plant TFs or co-activators, including members of the APETALA2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein (EREBP), MYB and growth-regulating factor (GRF) families. Peptides encoded by 13 of the isolated cDNAs were classified as potential TFs or co-activators because of the presence of conserved TF-like domains. Additionally, 2, 11, and 13 clones encoded kinases, chromosome-related proteins, and unknown proteins, respectively, while the remaining 16 cDNAs were associated with specific functions seemingly unrelated to TFs. Expression pattern analysis of selected TF-encoding genes via RT-PCR revealed that these genes were expressed during seed development, with differential transcription observed during various stages. This work provides informative hints for further study of the regulatory mechanism of rice seed development and illustrates an identification strategy that will be of practical value for the isolation of TFs and co-activators associated with specific plant developmental processes.
16006597	OsPTF1, a novel transcription factor involved in tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	We report here on a novel transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix domain for tolerance to inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation in rice (Oryza sativa). The gene is designated OsPTF1. The expression of OsPTF1 is Pi starvation induced in roots while constitutively expressed in shoots, as shown by northern-blot analysis. Overexpression of OsPTF1 enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation in transgenic rice. Tillering ability, root and shoot biomass, and phosphorus content of transgenic rice plants were about 30% higher than those of the wild-type plants in Pi-deficient conditions in hydroponic experiments. In soil pot and field experiments, more than 20% increase in tiller number, panicle weight, and phosphorus content was observed in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants at low-Pi levels. In Pi-deficient conditions, transgenic rice plants showed significantly higher total root length and root surface area, which results in a higher instantaneous Pi uptake rate over their wild-type counterparts. Microarray analysis for transgenic plants overexpressing OsPTF1 has been performed to investigate the downstream regulation of OsPTF1.
9311985	RF2a, a bZIP transcriptional activator of the phloem-specific rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter, functions in vascular development.	1997	EMBO J	Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) replicates only in phloem cells in infected rice plants and its promoter drives strong phloem-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic rice plants. We isolated a cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, RF2a, which binds to the Box II cis element that is important for expression from the promoter. RF2a, which stimulates Box II-dependent transcription in a homologous in vitro transcription system, accumulates in nuclei of phloem and certain other cell types in shoots, but is found at only very low levels in roots. Transgenic antisense plants in which RF2a accumulation was suppressed had normal roots but stunted, twisted leaves with small, disorganized vascular bundles, an enlarged sclerenchyma and large air spaces. We propose that the RTBV promoter exploits a host transcription factor that is critical for leaf tissue differentiation and vascular development for its expression.
9491803	Molecular cloning of the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of plant DNA polymerase alpha and its cell-cycle dependent expression.	1997	Genes Cells	BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase alpha has been studied in considerable detail in yeast and animals. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that this enzyme is composed of a heterotetramer and is necessary for replicon initiation and primer synthesis in lagging strand synthesis. In spite of the fact that modes of DNA replication in plants seem to be similar to those in other eukaryotes, very little is known about the biochemical components that participate in DNA replication of plants, including DNA polymerases.

RESULTS: Using a 561-base pair DNA fragment, obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a rice cDNA library as a probe, we isolated and sequenced a cDNA homologous to the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of rice DNA polymerase alpha. The encoded polypeptide has extensive homology with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha from several species. Furthermore, when the cDNA was expressed in eukaryotic transcription/translation systems, the protein products showed DNA polymerase activity which was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for DNA polymerase alpha. Using RNA gel blot analysis, we found that the levels of mRNA of the catalytic subunit of this enzyme is regulated during the cell-cycle in plant cells.

CONCLUSION: This is the first report which describes the cDNA cloning of plant DNA polymerase. We conclude that the principal features of the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit are conserved in plants.

16861806	Characterization of a rice gene family encoding type-A diterpene cyclases.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We have previously isolated and characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) cDNAs, OsCyc1/OsCPS4, OsCyc2/OsCPS2, OsKS4, OsDTC1/OsKS7, OsDTC2/OsKS8 and OsKS10, which encode cyclases that are responsible for diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis. Among the other members of this gene family, OsCPS1 and OsKS1 have been suggested as being responsible for gibberellin biosynthesis, OsKSL11 has recently been shown to encode stemodene synthase, and the functions of the three other diterpene cyclase genes in the rice genome, OsKS3, OsKS5 and OsKS6, have not yet been determined. In this study, we show that recombinant OsKS5 and OsKS6 expressed in E. coli converted ent-copalyl diphosphate into ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene and ent-kaur-15-ene, respectively. Neither product is a hydrocarbon precursor required in the biosynthesis of either gibberellins or phytoalexins. OsKS3 may be a pseudogene from which the translated product is a truncated enzyme. These results suggest that the diterpene cyclase genes responsible for gibberellin and phytoalexin biosynthesis are not functionally redundant.
15891897	Identification of three shikimate kinase genes in rice: characterization of their differential expression during panicle development and of the enzymatic activities of the encoded proteins.	2005	Planta	The shikimate pathway is common to the biosynthesis of the three aromatic amino acids and that of various secondary metabolites in land plants. Shikimate kinase (SK; EC 2.7.1.71) catalyzes the phosphorylation of shikimate to yield shikimate 3-phosphate. In an attempt to elucidate the functional roles of enzymes that participate in the shikimate pathway in rice (Oryza sativa), we have now identified and characterized cDNAs corresponding to three SK genes--OsSK1, OsSK2, and OsSK3--in this monocotyledenous plant. These SK cDNAs encode proteins with different NH(2)-terminal regions and with putative mature regions that share sequence similarity with other plant and microbial SK proteins. An in vitro assay of protein import into intact chloroplasts isolated from pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings revealed that the full-length forms of the three rice SK proteins are translocated into chloroplasts and processed, consistent with the assumption that the different NH(2)-terminal sequences function as chloroplast transit peptides. The processed forms of all three rice proteins synthesized in vitro manifested SK catalytic activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsSK1 and OsSK2 was induced in rice calli by treatment with the elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose, and that expression of OsSK1 and OsSK3 was up-regulated specifically during the heading stage of panicle development. These results suggest that differential expression of the three rice SK genes and the accompanying changes in the production of shikimate 3-phosphate may contribute to the defense response and to panicle development in rice.
16461585	PLASTOCHRON2 regulates leaf initiation and maturation in rice.	2006	Plant Cell	In higher plants, leaves initiate in constant spatial and temporal patterns. Although the pattern of leaf initiation is a key element of plant shoot architecture, little is known about how the time interval between initiation events, termed plastochron, is regulated. Here, we present a detailed analysis of plastochron2 (pla2), a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron and precocious maturation of leaves during the vegetative phase and ectopic shoot formation during the reproductive phase. The corresponding PLA2 gene is revealed to be an orthologue of terminal ear1, a maize (Zea mays) gene that encodes a MEI2-like RNA binding protein. PLA2 is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia. We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family. Based on these analyses, we propose a model in which plastochron is determined by signals from immature leaves that act non-cell-autonomously in the shoot apical meristem to inhibit the initiation of new leaves.
16412485	Flavonoid 3'-O-methyltransferase from rice: cDNA cloning, characterization and functional expression.	2006	Phytochemistry	Plant O-methyltransferases (OMTs) are known to be involved in methylation of plant secondary metabolites, especially phenylpropanoid and flavonoid compounds. An OMT, ROMT-9, was cloned and characterized from rice using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The blast results for ROMT-9 showed a 73% identity with caffeic acid OMTs from maize and Triticum aestivum. ROMT-9 was expressed in Escherichia coli and its recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography. It was then tested for its ability to transfer the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the flavonoid substrates, eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin, and taxifolin, all of which have a 3'-hydroxyl functional group. The reaction products were analyzed using TLC, HPLC, HPLC/MS, and NMR spectroscopy. The NMR analysis showed that ROMT-9 transferred the methyl group specifically to the 3'-hydroxyl group of quercetin, resulting in the formation of its methoxy derivative. Furthermore, ROMT-9 converted flavonoids containing the 3'-hydroxy functional group such as eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin and taxifolin into the corresponding methoxy derivatives, suggesting that ROMT-9 is an OMT with strict specificity for the 3'-hydroxy group of flavonoids.
16527928	Rice domestication by reducing shattering.	2006	Science	Crop domestication frequently began with the selection of plants that did not naturally shed ripe fruits or seeds. The reduction in grain shattering that led to cereal domestication involved genetic loci of large effect. The molecular basis of this key domestication transition, however, remains unknown. Here we show that human selection of an amino acid substitution in the predicted DNA binding domain encoded by a gene of previously unknown function was primarily responsible for the reduction of grain shattering in rice domestication. The substitution undermined the gene function necessary for the normal development of an abscission layer that controls the separation of a grain from the pedicel.
16842786	Calmodulin isoform-specific activation of a rice calmodulin-binding kinase conferred by only three amino-acids of OsCaM61.	2006	FEBS Lett	The kinase activity of a Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-binding serine/threonine protein kinase from rice (Oryza sativa) (OsCBK) has been reported to be unaffected by OsCaM1 binding. In this study, we examined whether other rice CaMs can stimulate OsCBK. It was observed that OsCaM61 stimulated OsCBK in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In addition, Ala(111), Gly(123) and Ser(127) were identified as critical residues for OsCBK activation. Mutational study and fluorescent spectroscopy analysis indicated that CaM-binding affinity does not correlate with the kinase activity and that these key amino-acids in OsCaM61 play a vital role in suitable changes of OsCBK conformation for kinase activation.
16377757	A rice glutamate receptor-like gene is critical for the division and survival of individual cells in the root apical meristem.	2006	Plant Cell	Glu receptors are known to function as Glu-activated ion channels that mediate mostly excitatory neurotransmission in animals. Glu receptor-like genes have also been reported in higher plants, although their function is largely unknown. We have identified a rice (Oryza sativa) Glu receptor-like gene, designated GLR3.1, in which mutation by T-DNA insertion caused a short-root mutant phenotype. Histology and DNA synthesis analyses revealed that the mutant root meristematic activity is distorted and is accompanied by enhanced programmed cell death. Our results supply genetic evidence that a plant Glu receptor-like gene, rice GLR3.1, is essential for the maintenance of cell division and individual cell survival in the root apical meristem at the early seedling stage.
16753820	Cloning, characterization and tissue-specific expression of a cDNA encoding a novel EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2 gene (OsEMF2) in Oryza sativa.	2006	DNA Seq	EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2 (EMF2) gene plays a major role in maintain vegetative development and repress flower development. Here, we present the cloning, characterization and tissue-specific expression of a putative EMF2 (OsEMF2) gene in Oryza sativa. The full-length cDNA of OsEMF2 was 1899 bp and contained an 1872 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 624 amino acid protein. Homologous analysis showed that OsEMF2 contain a single conserved C2H2-type zinc finger motif. Sequence alignment shows that there is a homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of OsEMF2 and EMF2 in Zea mays (55%). Moreover, pI of OsEMF2 are predicted. The tissue-specific expression pattern of OsEMF2 reveals that it is abundant in shoot apical meristem and inflorescence meristem, while its expression level is much lower in leaf, root, immature seed and callus.
16649109	The highly charged region of plant beta-type phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase is involved in membrane targeting and phospholipid binding.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	In Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, two types of PI 4-kinase (PI4Ks) have been isolated and functionally characterized. The alpha-type PI4Ks (approximately 220 kDa) contain a PH domain, which is lacking in beta-type PI4Ks (approximately 120 kDa). Beta-type PI4Ks, exemplified by Arabidopsis AtPI4Kbeta and rice OsPI4K2, contain a highly charged repetitive segment designated PPC (Plant PI4K Charged) region, which is an unique domain only found in plant beta-type PI4Ks at present. The PPC region has a length of approximately 300 amino acids and harboring 11 (AtPI4Kbeta) and 14 (OsPI4K2) repeats, respectively, of a 20-aa motif. Studies employing a modified yeast-based "Sequence of Membrane-Targeting Detection" system demonstrate that the PPC(OsPI4K2) region, as well as the former 8 and latter 6 repetitive motifs within the PPC region, are able to target fusion proteins to the plasma membrane. Further detection on the transiently expressed GFP fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells showed that the PPC(OsPI4K2) region alone, as well as the region containing repetitive motifs 1-8, was able to direct GFP to the plasma membrane, while the regions containing less repetitive motifs, i.e. 6, 4, 2 or single motif(s) led to predominantly intracellular localization. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of PPC-GFP fusion protein further confirms the membrane-targeting capacities of PPC region. In addition, the predominant plasma membrane localization of AtPI4Kbeta was mediated by the PPC region. Recombinant PPC peptide, expressed in E. coli, strongly binds phosphatidic acid, PI and PI4P, but not phosphatidylcholine, PI5P, or PI(4,5)P2 in vitro, providing insights into potential mechanisms for regulating sub-cellular localization and lipid binding for the plant beta-type PI4Ks.
16820865	OsFY, a homolog of AtFY, encodes a protein that can interact with OsFCA-gamma in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis. FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA. The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis. However, it is not clear if the regulation of this autonomous flowering pathway is also present in monocot plants, such as rice. Recently, alternative RNA processing of OsFCA was observed in rice, which strongly suggested the existence of an autonomous flowering pathway in rice. In this work, we cloned the cDNA of the autonomous flowering pathway gene OsFY from rice. The predicted OsFY protein contained a conserved 7 WD-repeat region and at least two Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro motifs compared to Arabidopsis FY. The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system. The GenBank database search provided evidence of expression for other autonomous pathway gene homologs in rice. These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots.
16572174	A silicon transporter in rice.	2006	Nature	Silicon is beneficial to plant growth and helps plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses by preventing lodging (falling over) and increasing resistance to pests and diseases, as well as other stresses. Silicon is essential for high and sustainable production of rice, but the molecular mechanism responsible for the uptake of silicon is unknown. Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant. This gene belongs to the aquaporin family and is constitutively expressed in the roots. Lsi1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells, where casparian strips are located. Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake. Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only. The identification of a silicon transporter provides both an insight into the silicon uptake system in plants, and a new strategy for producing crops with high resistance to multiple stresses by genetic modification of the root's silicon uptake capacity.
16450172	Isolation of a cDNA clone (PcSrp) encoding serine-rich-protein from Porteresia coarctata T. and its expression in yeast and finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) affording salt tolerance.	2006	Planta	A 1.4 Kb cDNA clone encoding a serine-rich protein has been isolated from the cDNA library of salt stressed roots of Porteresia coarctata, and designated as P. coarctata serine-rich-protein (PcSrp) encoding gene. Northern analysis and in situ mRNA hybridization revealed the expression of PcSrp in the salt stressed roots and rhizome of P. coarctata. However, no such expression was seen in the salt stressed leaves and in the unstressed tissues of root, rhizome and leaf, indicating that PcSrp is under the control of a salt-inducible tissue-specific promoter. In yeast, the PcSrp conferred increased NaCl tolerance, implicating its role in salinity tolerance at cellular level. Further, PcSrp was cloned downstream to rice Actin-1 promoter and introduced into finger millet through particle-inflow-gun method. Transgenic plants expressing PcSrp were able to grow to maturity and set seed under 250 mM NaCl stress. The untransformed control plants by contrast failed to survive under similar salt stress. The stressed roots of transgenic plants invariably accumulated higher Na(+) and K(+) ion contents compared to roots of untransformed plants; whereas, shoots of transgenics accumulated lower levels of both the ions than that of untransformed plants under identical stress, clearly suggesting the involvement of PcSrp in ion homeostasis contributing to salt tolerance.
2518836	Nucleotide sequence of the psbB gene of Euglena gracilis.	1989	Plant Mol Biol	
16100779	The map-based sequence of the rice genome.	2005	Nature	Rice, one of the world's most important food plants, has important syntenic relationships with the other cereal species and is a model plant for the grasses. Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95% of the 389 Mb genome, including virtually all of the euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37,544 non-transposable-element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71% had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90% of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37,544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits. The additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats identified in our study should accelerate improvements in rice production.
16753816	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene.	2006	DNA Seq	A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene OsRING-1 was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening. OsRING-1 is 1670 bp in length and encodes a 46.6 kDa basic protein with two transmembrane (TM) domains, a basic domain (BD), a conserved domain (CD), a RING finger domain and a serine rich (S-rich) domain. By database search, OsRING-1 was mapped on chromosome 2 and clustered together with other six zinc finger genes. The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region. Northern analysis showed that OsRING-1 was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments. Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths. Taken together, OsRING-1, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways.
16623884	Sequencing and characterization of telomere and subtelomere regions on rice chromosomes 1S, 2S, 2L, 6L, 7S, 7L and 8S.	2006	Plant J	Telomeres, which are important for chromosome maintenance, are composed of long, repetitive DNA sequences associated with a variety of telomere-binding proteins. We characterized the organization and structure of rice telomeres and adjacent subtelomere regions on the basis of cytogenetic and sequence analyses. The length of the rice telomeres ranged from 5.1 to 10.8 kb, as revealed by both fibre-fluorescent in situ hybridization and terminal restriction-fragment assay. Physical maps of the chromosomal ends were constructed from a fosmid library. This facilitated sequencing of the telomere regions of chromosomes 1S, 2S, 2L, 6L, 7S, 7L and 8S. The resulting sequences contained conserved TTTAGGG telomere repeats, which indicates that the physical maps partly covered the telomere regions of the respective chromosome arms. These repeats were organized in the order of 5'-TTTAGGG-3' from the chromosome-specific region, except in chromosome 7S, in which seven inverted copies also existed in tandem array. Analysis of the telomere-flanking regions revealed the occurrence of deletions, insertions, or chromosome-specific substitutions of single nucleotides within the repeat sequences at the junction between the telomere and subtelomere. The sequences of the 500-kb regions of the seven chromosome ends were analysed in detail. A total of 598 genes were predicted in the telomeric regions. In addition, repetitive sequences derived from various kinds of retrotransposon were identified. No significant evidence for segmental duplication could be detected within or among the subtelomere regions. These results indicate that the rice chromosome ends are heterogeneous in both sequence and characterization.
16256063	An unexpected diterpene cyclase from rice: functional identification of a stemodene synthase.	2006	Arch Biochem Biophys	We have cloned a novel diterpene synthase (OsKSL11) from rice that produces stemod-13(17)-ene from syn-copalyl diphosphate. Notably, this gene sequence was not predicted from the extensive sequence information available for rice, nor, despite extensive phytochemical investigations, has this diterpene or any derived natural product previously been reported in rice plants. OsKSL11 represents the first identified stemodene synthase, which catalyzes the committed step in biosynthesis of the stemodane family of diterpenoid natural products, some of which possess antiviral activity. In addition, OsKSL11 is highly homologous to the mechanistically similar stemarene synthase recently identified from rice, making this pair of diterpene cyclases an excellent model system for investigating the enzymatic determinants for differential product outcome. The unexpected nature of this cyclase and its product parallels recent observations of previously unrecognized natural products metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that many, if not all, plant species will prove to have extensive biosynthetic capacity.
16939657	An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice.	2006	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The bZIP class Abscisic acid Responsive Element (ABRE)-binding factor, OSBZ8 (38.5 kD) has been considered to regulate ABA-mediated transcription in the suspension cultured cells of japonica rice. Still, nothing is known about the expression of OSBZ8 at protein level in vegetative tissue of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice plants. In our previous study, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) of [32P]ABRE-DNA and nuclear extracts prepared from the lamina of Pokkali rice plants has detected the presence of an ABRE-binding factor. Northern analysis has also detected salinity stress induced accumulation of transcripts for bZIP class of factor. Therefore, OSBZ8 was considered to play an important role in the regulation of transcription in the vegetative tissue of rice. The aim of this study is to find out whether OSBZ8 has any role in regulating the NaCl-stress induced gene expression in vegetative tissue and whether the expression of OSBZ8 factor directly correlates with the stress tolerance of different varieties of indica type rice.

RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of OSBZ8 (OSBZ8p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1.3 kb hybridized and its level was much higher in tolerant cultivar. EMSA with Em1a, the strongest ABA Responsive Element till reported from the upstream of EmBP1, and the nuclear extracts from laminar tissue of untreated and salt-treated seedlings of three salt sensitive, one moderately sensitive and two salt tolerant indica rice cultivars showed specific binding of nuclear factor to ABRE element. Intensity of binding was low and inducible in salt sensitive rice cultivars while high and constitutive in salt tolerant cultivars. EMSA with 300 bp 5'upstream region of Rab16A gene, a well known salt stress and ABA-inducible gene of rice, showed formation of two complexes, again very weak in salt sensitive and strong in salt tolerant rice cultivar.

CONCLUSION: The bZIP factor OSBZ8 was found to be present in the ABRE-DNA: protein complex as shown by the supershift of the complex by the purified antiserum raised against OSBZ8p. Treatment of the seedlings with NaCl was found to enhance the complex formation, suggesting the regulation of OSBZ8 gene at both transcriptional and post-translational steps. Comparative EMSA with different varieties of rice suggests a positive correlation with the expression pattern of OSBZ8 and salt tolerance in rice cultivars.
16394586	Genealogy of the "Green Revolution" gene in rice.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	During the "Green Revolution" of rice, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) were developed using a semi-dwarf gene (sd1 or OsGA20ox2). The presence or absence of the two mutant alleles (DGWG type in Dee-geo-woo-gen and JKK type in Jikkoku) were surveyed by PCR using 256 accessions of eight wild and two cultivate rice species. The DGWG allele was detected in a landrace (Oryza sativa) and two accessions of wild rice (O. rufipogon), all of which are from China, showing their limited distribution. Genealogical studies of the OsGA20ox2 gene showed that the 62 sequences of O. sativa and O. rufipogon included 20 distinct haplotypes, indicating that the species complex contained OsGA20ox2 genes from two different lineages. The silent site nucleotide diversities (pi and theta(w)) were extremely low in Japonica rice, suggesting a genetic bottleneck. The haplotype network showed that the DGWG and JKK alleles were derived in different lineages. The DGWG carrier (W1944) had unique polymorphisms in the surrounding region of the locus, suggesting that the DGWG allele has been preserved in the wild progenitor, rather than that the DGWG allele has been introgressed from HYVs to W1944. Although a semi-dwarfing plant is a weak competitor under saturated fields, the crossing experiment revealed that the DGWG variant might have been preserved as a hidden variation in the genetic background of wild rice, without expressing a short-stature.
16284419	Members of TALE and WUS subfamilies of homeodomain proteins with potentially important functions in development form dimers within each subfamily in rice.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	Transacting factors often form homo- and heterodimers and regulate various targets, the type of regulation depending on the dimeric combination. The WUS and TALE subfamilies are two atypical homeodomains in plants. A homeodomain mediates sequence-specific binding to its target DNA and usually consists of 60 amino acid residues, whereas atypical homeodomains have extra amino acid residues in the well-conserved region. The genes OsWUS and OsPRS, which encode atypical homeodomain proteins from the WUS subfamily, and OsBEL and OSH15, which encode those from the TALE subfamily, were isolated from rice and tested for their interactions by yeast two-hybrid analysis. OsWUS and OsPRS formed homodimers and formed heterodimers with each other but did not form dimers with the TALE family homeodomain proteins OSH15 or OsBEL. Likewise, OSH15 and OsBEL formed homodimers and heterodimers but did not form dimers with the WUS family homeodomain proteins OsWUS and OsPRS. These findings suggest that the combinations of dimers are well correlated with the classification of these proteins on the basis of sequence similarity. RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of OsWUS and OsPRS was detected in the same organs, namely floral buds, roots, and suspension cells. Therefore, it is possible that the proteins encoded by both of these genes function as homo- and heterodimers in planta. These results suggest that, during the evolution of these subfamilies, various combinations of dimers within proteins encoded by paralogous genes were formed and generated independent regulatory networks that enabled complex patterns of plant development.
16249326	Molecular cloning, functional expression and subcellular localization of two putative vacuolar voltage-gated chloride channels in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated two cDNA clones (OsCLC-1 and OsCLC-2) homologous to tobacco CLC-Nt1, which encodes a voltage-gated chloride channel, from rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica, cv. Nipponbare). The deduced amino acid sequences were highly conserved (87.9% identity with each other). Southern blot analysis of the rice genomic DNA revealed that OsCLC-1 and OsCLC-2 were single-copy genes on chromosomes 4 and 2, respectively. OsCLC-1 was expressed in most tissues, whereas OsCLC-2 was expressed only in the roots, nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths. The level of expression of OsCLC-1, but not of OsCLC-2, was increased by treatment with NaCl. Both genes could partly substitute for GEF1, which encodes the sole chloride channel in yeast, by restoring growth under ionic stress. These results indicate that both genes are chloride channel genes. The proteins from both genes were immunochemically detected in the tonoplast fraction. Tagged synthetic green fluorescent protein which was fused to OsCLC-1 or OsCLC-2 localized in the vacuolar membranes. These results indicate that the proteins may play a role in the transport of chloride ions across the vacuolar membrane. We isolated loss-of-function mutants of both genes from a panel of rice mutants produced by the insertion of a retrotransposon, Tos17, in the exon region, and found inhibition of growth at all life stages.
17028208	Rice plastidial N-glycosylated nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase is transported from the ER-golgi to the chloroplast through the secretory pathway.	2006	Plant Cell	A nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) activity that catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of ADP-glucose (ADPG) has been shown to occur in the plastidial compartment of both mono- and dicotyledonous plants. To learn more about this enzyme, we purified two NPPs from rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings. Both enzymes are glycosylated, since they bind to concanavalin A, stain with periodic acid-Schiff reagent, and are digested by Endo-H. A complete rice NPP cDNA, designated as NPP1, was isolated, characterized, and overexpressed in transgenic plants displaying high ADPG hydrolytic activity. Databank searches revealed that NPP1 belongs to a functionally divergent group of plant nucleotide hydrolases. NPP1 contains numerous N-glycosylation sites and a cleavable hydrophobic signal sequence that does not match with the N-terminal part of the mature protein. Both immunocytochemical analyses and confocal fluorescence microscopy of rice cells expressing NPP1 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that NPP1-GFP occurs in the plastidial compartment. Brefeldin A treatment of NPP1-GFP-expressing cells prevented NPP1-GFP accumulation in the chloroplasts. Endo-H digestibility studies revealed that both NPP1 and NPP1-GFP in the chloroplast are glycosylated. Collectively, these data demonstrate the trafficking of glycosylated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system to the chloroplast in higher plants.
16501255	Functional characterization of OsPPT1, which encodes p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in Oryza sativa.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	Prenylation of the aromatic intermediate p-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) is a critical step in ubiquinone (UQ) biosynthesis. The enzyme that catalyzes this prenylation reaction is p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (PPT), which substitutes an aromatic proton at the m-position of PHB with a prenyl chain provided by polyprenyl diphosphate synthase. The rice genome contains three PPT candidates that share significant similarity with the yeast PPT (COQ2 gene), and the rice gene showing the highest similarity to COQ2 was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR and designated OsPPT1a. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPPT1a contained a putative mitochondrial sorting signal at the N-terminus and conserved domains for putative substrate-binding sites typical of PPT protein family members. The subcellular localization of OsPPT1a protein was shown to be mainly in mitochondria based on studies using a green fluorescent protein-PPT fusion. A yeast complementation study revealed that OsPPT1a expression successfully recovered the growth defect of the coq2 mutant. A prenyltransferase assay using recombinant protein showed that OsPPT1a accepted prenyl diphosphates of various chain lengths as prenyl donors, whereas it showed strict substrate specificity for the aromatic substrate PHB as a prenyl acceptor. The apparent K (m) values for geranyl diphosphate and PHB were 59.7 and 6.04 microM, respectively. The requirement by OsPPT1a and COQ2 for divalent cations was also studied, with Mg2+ found to produce the highest enzyme activity. Northern analysis showed that OsPPT1a mRNA was accumulated in all tissues of O. sativa. These results suggest that OsPPT1a is a functional PPT involved in UQ biosynthesis in O. sativa.
16381971	The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB): hub for Oryza sativa ssp. japonica genome information.	2006	Nucleic Acids Res	With the completion of the rice genome sequencing, a standardized annotation is necessary so that the information from the genome sequence can be fully utilized in understanding the biology of rice and other cereal crops. An annotation jamboree was held in Japan with the aim of annotating and manually curating all the genes in the rice genome. Here we present the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), which has been developed to provide access to the annotation data. The RAP-DB has two different types of annotation viewers, BLAST and BLAT search, and other useful features. By connecting the annotations to other rice genomics data, such as full-length cDNAs and Tos17 mutant lines, the RAP-DB serves as a hub for rice genomics. All of the resources can be accessed through http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.
12121993	Identification of a short highly conserved amino acid sequence as the functional region required for posttranscriptional autoregulation of the cystathionine gamma-synthase gene in Arabidopsis.	2002	J Biol Chem	Cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) catalyzes the first committed step of Met biosynthesis in plants. We have previously shown that expression of the gene for CGS is feedback-regulated at the level of mRNA stability, and that the amino acid sequence encoded by the first exon of the CGS gene itself is responsible for the regulation (Chiba, Y., Ishikawa, M., Kijima, F., Tyson, R. H., Kim, J., Yamamoto, A., Nambara, E., Leustek, T., Wallsgrove, R. M., and Naito, S. (1999) Science 286, 1371-1374). To identify the functional region within CGS exon 1, deletion analysis was performed. The results showed that the 41-amino acid region of exon 1 highly conserved among plants is necessary and sufficient for the regulation. Analyses of in vivo and in vitro generated mutations that abolish the regulation identified the functionally important amino acids as 11-13 residues within this conserved region. The importance of these residues was confirmed by deletion analysis within the conserved region. These studies identified the functional region of CGS exon 1 required for the posttranscriptional autoregulation of the CGS gene as (A)RRNCSNIGVAQ(I), with uncertainty of the first and last residues. This sequence is almost perfectly conserved among CGS sequences of higher plants but cannot be found elsewhere in the public databases.
16891402	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage.	2006	Plant Cell	One of the mechanisms plants have developed for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage involves a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, which has been proposed to be reduced by ferredoxin and plastid thioredoxins, Trx x and CDSP32, the FTR/Trx pathway. We show that rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast NADPH THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRC), with a thioredoxin domain, uses NADPH to reduce the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide. The presence of both NTR and Trx-like domains in a single polypeptide is absolutely required for the high catalytic efficiency of NTRC. An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light. Constitutive expression of wild-type NTRC in mutant transgenic lines rescued this phenotype. Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by light/dark incubation produced an increase in hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in leaves and accelerated senescence of NTRC-deficient plants. We propose that NTRC constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power. Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power.
16963705	Doubling genome size without polyploidization: dynamics of retrotransposition-driven genomic expansions in Oryza australiensis, a wild relative of rice.	2006	Genome Res	Retrotransposons are the main components of eukaryotic genomes, representing up to 80% of some large plant genomes. These mobile elements transpose via a "copy and paste" mechanism, thus increasing their copy number while active. Their accumulation is now accepted as the main factor of genome size increase in higher eukaryotes, besides polyploidy. However, the dynamics of this process are poorly understood. In this study, we show that Oryza australiensis, a wild relative of the Asian cultivated rice O. sativa, has undergone recent bursts of three LTR-retrotransposon families. This genome has accumulated more than 90,000 retrotransposon copies during the last three million years, leading to a rapid twofold increase of its size. In addition, phenetic analyses of these retrotransposons clearly confirm that the genomic bursts occurred posterior to the radiation of the species. This provides direct evidence of retrotransposon-mediated variation of genome size within a plant genus.
16980130	Salt induces expression of RH3.2A, encoding an H3.2-type histone H3 protein in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Histone H3 is one of the four histones, along with H2A, H2B, and H4, which form the eukaryotic nucleosome octamer core. In this study, a new gene RH3.2A encoding an H3.2-type histone H3 protein from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was reported. RH3.2A was cloned through RT-PCR from salt-treated rice seedlings. This gene encoded a protein of 136 amino acid residues that were similar to some plant histone H3 proteins reported previously. However, the cDNA sequence of RH3.2A and other rice H3 genes were different. Alignment of RH3.2A encoding protein with other plant histone H3 proteins revealed that three amino acid residues (32, 88, and 91) were markedly different between H3.1-type and H3.2-type proteins. The mRNA expression analysis of RH3.2A revealed that RH3.2A gene was upregulated by salt stress in rice roots and ABA treatment in seedlings. The potential role of RH3.2A during salt stress was discussed.
16387888	The broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi9 encodes a nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a multigene family in rice.	2006	Genetics	The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was cloned using a map-based cloning strategy. Sequencing of a 76-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Pi9 locus led to identification of six tandemly arranged resistance-like genes with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Nbs1-Pi9-Nbs6-Pi9). Analysis of selected Pi9 deletion mutants and transformation of a 45-kb fragment from the BAC contig into the susceptible rice cultivar TP309 narrowed down Pi9 to the candidate genes Nbs2-Pi9 and Nbs3-Pi9. Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2-Pi9 is the Pi9 gene. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the six paralogs at the Pi9 locus belong to four classes and gene duplication might be one of the major evolutionary forces contributing to the formation of the NBS-LRR gene cluster. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that Pi9 was constitutively expressed in the Pi9-resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection. The cloned Pi9 gene provides a starting point to elucidate the molecular basis of the broad-spectrum disease resistance and the evolutionary mechanisms of blast resistance gene clusters in rice.
16805736	Impaired sucrose induction1 encodes a conserved plant-specific protein that couples carbohydrate availability to gene expression and plant growth.	2006	Plant J	To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying carbohydrate allocation to storage processes, we have isolated mutants in which the sugar induction of starch biosynthetic gene expression was impaired. Here we describe the IMPAIRED SUCROSE INDUCTION1 (ISI1) gene, which encodes a highly conserved plant-specific protein with structural similarities to Arm repeat proteins. ISI1 is predominantly expressed in the phloem of leaves following the sink-to-source transition during leaf development, but is also sugar-inducible in mesophyll cells. Soil-grown isi1 mutants show reduced plant growth and seed set compared to wild-type Arabidopsis. This growth reduction is not due to reduced carbohydrate availability or a defect in sucrose export from mature leaves, suggesting that isi1 mutant plants do not utilize available carbohydrate resources efficiently. ISI1 interacts synergistically with, but is genetically distinct from, the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway controlling sugar responses via ABI4. Our data show that ISI1 couples the availability of carbohydrates to the control of sugar-responsive gene expression and plant growth.
16730655	Characterization of four RecQ homologues from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare).	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The RecQ family of DNA helicases is conserved throughout the biological kingdoms. In this report, we have characterized four RecQ homologues clearly expressed in rice. OsRecQ1, OsRecQ886, and OsRecQsim expressions were strongly detected in meristematic tissues. Transcription of the OsRecQ homologues was differentially induced by several types of DNA-damaging agents. The expression of four OsRecQ homologues was induced by MMS and bleomycin. OsRecQ1 and OsRecQ886 were induced by H(2)O(2), and MitomycinC strongly induced the expression of OsRecQ1. Transient expression of OsRecQ/GFP fusion proteins demonstrated that OsRecQ2 and OsRecQ886 are found in nuclei, whereas OsRecQ1 and OsRecQsim are found in plastids. Neither OsRecQ1 nor OsRecQsim are induced by light. These results indicate that four of the RecQ homologues have different and specific functions in DNA repair pathways, and that OsRecQ1 and OsRecQsim may not involve in plastid differentiation but different aspects of a plastid-specific DNA repair system.
16496151	3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase is regulated for the accumulation of polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters in rice (Oryza sativa L.) internode cell walls.	2006	Plant Cell Rep	Polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters (PHEs) over-accumulate in the internodes of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, Fukei 71 (F71). This accumulation is accompanied by over-expression of phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL). In this study, we show that only one member of the 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) family expresses in close correlation with PAL. Furthermore, substrate availability to DAHPS is promoted by down-regulating the expression of plastidic pyruvate kinase (PKp), a competitor of DAHPS. Since the over-production of PHEs is caused by D50 gene disruption, these results suggest that specific enzymes in the phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways are coordinately up-regulated. In addition, the results indicate that carbon-flow into the shikimate pathway is modified for the synthesis of PHEs, and is probably controlled by D50.
16228246	High-resolution mapping, cloning and molecular characterization of the Pi-k ( h ) gene of rice, which confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the gene-for-gene type of pathogen resistance, high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of resistance loci is required to facilitate map-based cloning of resistance genes. Here, we report the molecular mapping and cloning of a dominant gene (Pi-k ( h )) present in the rice line Tetep, which is associated with resistance to rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea. This gene is effective against M. grisea populations prevalent in the Northwestern Himalayan region of India. Using 178 sequence tagged microsatellite, sequence-tagged site, expressed sequence tag and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to genotype a population of 208 F(2) individuals, we mapped the Pi-k ( h ) gene between two SSR markers (TRS26 and TRS33) which are 0.7 and 0.5 cM away, respectively, and can be used in marker-assisted-selection for blast-resistant rice cultivars. We used the markers to identify the homologous region in the genomic sequence of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare, and a physical map consisting of two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome and P1 artificial chromosome clones was assembled, spanning a region of 143,537 bp on the long arm of chromosome 11. Using bioinformatic analyses, we then identified a candidate blast-resistance gene in the region, and cloned the homologous sequence from Tetep. The putative Pi-k ( h ) gene cloned from Tetep is 1.5 kbp long with a single ORF, and belongs to the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat class of disease resistance genes. Structural and expression analysis of the Pi-k ( h ) gene revealed that its expression is pathogen inducible.
16624618	Plant fatty acid (ethanol) amide hydrolases.	2006	Biochim Biophys Acta	Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) plays a central role in modulating endogenous N-acylethanolamine (NAE) levels in vertebrates, and, in part, constitutes an "endocannabinoid" signaling pathway that regulates diverse physiological and behavioral processes in animals. Recently, an Arabidopsis FAAH homologue was identified which catalyzed the hydrolysis of NAEs in vitro suggesting a FAAH-mediated pathway exists in plants for the metabolism of endogenous NAEs. Here, we provide evidence to support this concept by identifying candidate FAAH genes in monocots (Oryza sativa) and legumes (Medicago truncatula), which have similar, but not identical, exon-intron organizations. Corresponding M. truncatula and rice cDNAs were isolated and cloned into prokaryotic expression vectors and expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. NAE amidohydrolase assays confirmed that these proteins indeed catalyzed the hydrolysis of 14C-labeled NAEs in vitro. Kinetic parameters and inhibition properties of the rice FAAH were similar to those of Arabidopsis and rat FAAH, but not identical. Sequence alignments and motif analysis of plant FAAH enzymes revealed a conserved domain organization for these members of the amidase superfamily. Five amino-acid residues determined to be important for catalysis by rat FAAH were absolutely conserved within the FAAH sequences of six plant species. Homology modeling of the plant FAAH proteins using the rat FAAH crystal structure as a template revealed a conserved protein core that formed the active site of each enzyme. Collectively, these results indicate that plant and mammalian FAAH proteins have similar structure/activity relationships despite limited overall sequence identity. Defining the molecular properties of NAE amidohydrolase enzymes in plants will help to better understand the metabolic regulation of NAE lipid mediators.
16755461	A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses.	2006	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in transmission of extracellular signals to the downstream effector proteins through a mechanism of protein phosphorylation. In this study, we isolated and identified a novel rice MAPK gene, OSBIMK2 ( ORYZAE SATIVA L. BTH-Induced MAP Kinase 2). The OSBIMK2 encodes a 506 amino acid protein with molecular weight of 63 kD. The recombinant OSBIMK2 expressed in ESCHERICHIA COLI showed an autophosphorylation activity IN VITRO. OSBIMK2 is a single-copy gene in the rice genome. Expression of OSBIMK2 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice. Expression of OsBIMK2 was also up-regulated during early stage after inoculation with MAGNAPORTHE GRISEA in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during an incompatible interaction between M. GRISEA and a blast-resistant rice genotype. Over-expression of the rice OSBIMK2 gene in transgenic tobacco resulted in an enhanced disease resistance against tomato mosaic virus and a fungal pathogen, ALTERNARIA ALTERNATA. These results suggest that OSBIMK2 plays a role in disease resistance responses.
16786279	Molecular cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding Lon protease from rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	Biotechnol Lett	The ATP-dependent Lon protease is a highly conserved enzyme that is present in archeae, eubacteria, and eukaryotes, and plays an important role in intracellular protein degradation. We have isolated a Lon protease gene, OsLon1, from Oryza sativa. The cDNA contained a 2,655 bp ORF. Comparative analysis showed that OsLon1 shared significant similarity with the previously reported Lon proteases from maize, Arabidopsis, human, and bacteria. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that OsLon1 was highly expressed in young leaves, mature leaves, and leaf sheaths but only weakly in young roots, mature roots, and young panicles. The OsLon1 gene was successfully expressed in E. coli and the detected protein size, about 120 kDa, matched the expected molecular mass of the His-tagged OsLon1 protein.
16640604	The N-terminal ATPase AT-hook-containing region of the Arabidopsis chromatin-remodeling protein SPLAYED is sufficient for biological activity.	2006	Plant J	The SNF2-like chromatin-remodeling ATPase SPLAYED (SYD) was identified as a co-activator of floral homeotic gene expression in Arabidopsis. SYD is also required for meristem maintenance and regulates flowering under a non-inductive photoperiod. SNF2 ATPases are structurally and functionally conserved from yeast to humans. In addition to the conserved protein features, SYD has a large unique C-terminal domain. We show here that SYD is present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and truncated, with the latter apparently lacking the C-terminal domain. The ratio of the two forms of endogenous SYD differs in juvenile and in adult tissues. Furthermore, an SYD variant lacking the C-terminal domain (SYDDeltaC) rescues the syd null mutant, indicating that the N-terminal ATPase AT-hook-containing region of SYD is sufficient for biological activity. Plants expressing SYDDeltaC show molecular and morphological phenotypes opposite to those of the null mutant, suggesting that the construct results in increased activity. This increased activity is at least in part due to elevated SYD protein levels in these lines. We propose that the C-terminal domain may control SYD accumulation and/or specific activity in the context of the full-length protein. The presence of the C-terminal domain in rice SYD suggests that its role is probably conserved in the two classes of flowering plants.
16461382	Point mutations with positive selection were a major force during the evolution of a receptor-kinase resistance gene family of rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	The rice (Oryza sativa) Xa26 gene, which confers resistance to bacterial blight disease and encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase, resides at a locus clustered with tandem homologous genes. To investigate the evolution of this family, four haplotypes from the two subspecies of rice, indica and japonica, were analyzed. Comparative sequence analysis of 34 genes of 10 types of paralogs of the family revealed haplotype polymorphisms and pronounced paralog diversity. The orthologs in different haplotypes were more similar than the paralogs in the same haplotype. At least five types of paralogs were formed before the separation of indica and japonica subspecies. Only 7% of amino acid sites were detected to be under positive selection, which occurred in the extracytoplasmic domain. Approximately 74% of the positively selected sites were solvent-exposed amino acid residues of the LRR domain that have been proposed to be involved in pathogen recognition, and 73% of the hypervariable sites detected in the LRR domain were subject to positive selection. The family is formed by tandem duplication followed by diversification through recombination, deletion, and point mutation. Most variation among genes in the family is caused by point mutations and positive selection.
16399804	Caught red-handed: Rc encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein conditioning red pericarp in rice.	2006	Plant Cell	Rc is a domestication-related gene required for red pericarp in rice (Oryza sativa). The red grain color is ubiquitous among the wild ancestors of O. sativa, in which it is closely associated with seed shattering and dormancy. Rc encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that was fine-mapped to an 18.5-kb region on rice chromosome 7 using a cross between Oryza rufipogon (red pericarp) and O. sativa cv Jefferson (white pericarp). Sequencing of the alleles from both mapping parents as well as from two independent genetic stocks of Rc revealed that the dominant red allele differed from the recessive white allele by a 14-bp deletion within exon 6 that knocked out the bHLH domain of the protein. A premature stop codon was identified in the second mutant stock that had a light red pericarp. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the Rc gene was expressed in both red- and white-grained rice but that a shortened transcript was present in white varieties. Phylogenetic analysis, supported by comparative mapping in rice and maize (Zea mays), showed that Rc, a positive regulator of proanthocyanidin, is orthologous with INTENSIFIER1, a negative regulator of anthocyanin production in maize, and is not in the same clade as rice bHLH anthocyanin regulators.
16193045	GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 encodes a soluble receptor for gibberellin.	2005	Nature	Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that are essential for many developmental processes in plants. It has been postulated that plants have both membrane-bound and soluble GA receptors; however, no GA receptors have yet been identified. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new GA-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gid1. The GID1 gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases, and we observed preferential localization of a GID1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in nuclei. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GID1 had a high affinity only for biologically active GAs, whereas mutated GST-GID1 corresponding to three gid1 alleles had no GA-binding affinity. The dissociation constant for GA4 was estimated to be around 10(-7) M, enough to account for the GA dependency of shoot elongation. Moreover, GID1 bound to SLR1, a rice DELLA protein, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. GID1 overexpression resulted in a GA-hypersensitive phenotype. Together, our results indicate that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signalling in rice.
16220344	Cloning and characterization of a novel splicing isoform of the iron-superoxide dismutase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Plant Cell Rep	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes in aerobic organisms that play a crucial role in protecting organisms against ROS. Here, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel alternatively spliced variant of the iron-superoxide dismutase gene, OsFe-SODb, from a rice panicle cDNA library. The alternative splicing event occurred in the fourth exon of the OsFe-SOD gene, and led to the translation of two isoforms of different sizes. The 5' flanking region of the OsFe-SOD was cloned and many cis-acting regulatory elements were found that are involved in light responsiveness, including a G-box and an I-box. RT-PCR analysis showed that the two alternative forms of OsFe-SOD were expressed in both the vegetative and reproductive tissues of Cpslo17. Moreover, accumulation of both isoforms was upregulated by light induction. In addition, the alternative splicing of OsFe-SOD mRNA was sensitive to low temperature. High yield production of the two recombinant OsFe-SOD isoforms was achieved in Escherichia coli. SOD assays showed that C-terminal truncation in OsFe-SODb did not result in a loss of SOD enzyme activity.
16432735	Cloning and comparative analysis of the gene encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase from wild type and cultivated soybean.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), as an important enzyme in triacylglycerol synthesis, catalyzes the final acylation of the Kennedy pathway. In the present study, the GmDGAT gene was cloned from Glycine max by using AtDGAT as a query to search against the soybean EST database and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. Allelic genes were also isolated from 13 soybean accessions and the divergence of the deduced amino acid sequences were compared. The comparison reveals that although GmDGAT is a highly conserved protein, several differences of insertion/deletion were identified in the N-terminal region of the GmDGATs from various soybean accessions. In the C-terminal regions, a single amino acid mutation specific to both G. max and G. soja was also found. The GmDGAT genomic sequences were further cloned and the number and size of exons in the DGAT genomic sequence were very similar among different plant species, whereas the introns were more diverged. These results may have significance in elucidating the genetic diversity of the GmDGAT among the soybean subgenus.
16489123	Cytoplasmic male sterility of rice with boro II cytoplasm is caused by a cytotoxic peptide and is restored by two related PPR motif genes via distinct modes of mRNA silencing.	2006	Plant Cell	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and nucleus-controlled fertility restoration are widespread plant reproductive features that provide useful tools to exploit heterosis in crops. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this kind of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction remains unclear. Here, we show in rice (Oryza sativa) with Boro II cytoplasm that an abnormal mitochondrial open reading frame, orf79, is cotranscribed with a duplicated atp6 (B-atp6) gene and encodes a cytotoxic peptide. Expression of orf79 in CMS lines and transgenic rice plants caused gametophytic male sterility. Immunoblot analysis showed that the ORF79 protein accumulates specifically in microspores. Two fertility restorer genes, Rf1a and Rf1b, were identified at the classical locus Rf-1 as members of a multigene cluster that encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. RF1A and RF1B are both targeted to mitochondria and can restore male fertility by blocking ORF79 production via endonucleolytic cleavage (RF1A) or degradation (RF1B) of dicistronic B-atp6/orf79 mRNA. In the presence of both restorers, RF1A was epistatic over RF1B in the mRNA processing. We have also shown that RF1A plays an additional role in promoting the editing of atp6 mRNAs, independent of its cleavage function.
16636480	Cloning and characterization of an RNase-related protein gene preferentially expressed in rice stems.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	RNase-related proteins (RRPs) are S- and S-like RNase homologs lacking the active site required for RNase activity. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) RRP gene (OsRRP). A single copy of OsRRP occurs in the rice genome. OsRRP contains three introns and an open reading frame encoding 252 amino acids, with the replacement of two histidines involved in the active site of RNase by lysine and tyrosine respectively. OsRRP is preferentially expressed in stems of wild-type rice and is significantly down-regulated in an increased tillering dwarf mutant ext37.
16900200	Sub1A is an ethylene-response-factor-like gene that confers submergence tolerance to rice.	2006	Nature	Most Oryza sativa cultivars die within a week of complete submergence--a major constraint to rice production in south and southeast Asia that causes annual losses of over US 1 billion dollars and affects disproportionately the poorest farmers in the world. A few cultivars, such as the O. sativa ssp. indica cultivar FR13A, are highly tolerant and survive up to two weeks of complete submergence owing to a major quantitative trait locus designated Submergence 1 (Sub1) near the centromere of chromosome 9 (refs 3, 4, 5-6). Here we describe the identification of a cluster of three genes at the Sub1 locus, encoding putative ethylene response factors. Two of these genes, Sub1B and Sub1C, are invariably present in the Sub1 region of all rice accessions analysed. In contrast, the presence of Sub1A is variable. A survey identified two alleles within those indica varieties that possess this gene: a tolerance-specific allele named Sub1A-1 and an intolerance-specific allele named Sub1A-2. Overexpression of Sub1A-1 in a submergence-intolerant O. sativa ssp. japonica conferred enhanced tolerance to the plants, downregulation of Sub1C and upregulation of Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1), indicating that Sub1A-1 is a primary determinant of submergence tolerance. The FR13A Sub1 locus was introgressed into a widely grown Asian rice cultivar using marker-assisted selection. The new variety maintains the high yield and other agronomic properties of the recurrent parent and is tolerant to submergence. Cultivation of this variety is expected to provide protection against damaging floods and increase crop security for farmers.
16326928	Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa.	2006	Plant Cell	The C-class MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) plays crucial roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development by regulating the organ identity of stamens and carpels, the repression of A-class genes, and floral meristem determinacy. To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of rice and maize (Zea mays). A knockout line of OSMADS3, in which the gene is disrupted by T-DNA insertion, shows homeotic transformation of stamens into lodicules and ectopic development of lodicules in the second whorl near the palea where lodicules do not form in the wild type but carpels develop almost normally. By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of the floral meristem is severely affected. These results suggest that the two C-class genes have been partially subfunctionalized during rice evolution (i.e., the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent gene duplication event in plant evolution).
16717423	Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The complete nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and its gene that encode a bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor of rice (Oryza sativa L.) (RASI) were analyzed. RASI cDNA (939 bp) encoded a 200-residue polypeptide with a molecular mass of 21,417 Da, including a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that RASI is closely related to alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitors from barley and wheat. RASI was found to be expressed only in seeds, suggesting that it has a seed-specific function. A coding region of RASI cDNA without the signal peptide was introduced into Escherichia coli and was expressed as a His-tagged protein. Recombinant RASI was purified to homogeneity in a single step by Ni-chelating affinity column chromatography and characterized to elucidate the target enzyme. The recombinant inhibitor had strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin, with an equimolar relationship, comparable with that of native RASI, and weak inhibitory activity toward some microbial alpha-amylases, but not toward animal or insect alpha-amylases. These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms.
16133310	Nucleotide polymorphism in the Adh2 region of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	DNA variation in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh2) region of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon and its related species was analyzed to clarify maintenance mechanisms of the DNA variation in these species. A dimorphic pattern was detected in the Adh2 region of O. rufipogon. The silent nucleotide diversity (pi) in the Adh2 region in O. rufipogon was 0.011, which was higher than that of the Adh1 region in O. rufipogon. Especially, a high nucleotide diversity was detected at synonymous sites of the catalytic domain 1. Average nucleotide diversity at silent sites within each of the dimorphic sequence types of the Adh2 region was similar to that in the Adh1 region, indicating that the high level of silent polymorphism in the Adh2 region was caused by the difference between the dimorphic sequence types. On the other hand, the level of replacement polymorphism in the Adh2 region was as low as that in the Adh1 region. The neutrality test of Fu and Li indicated significantly negative deviation from the neutral mutation model for the replacement sites of the Adh2 region. This result suggests purifying selection on the replacement sites of the Adh2 region, as detected for the Adh1 region. Significant linkage disequilibria (16.4% of the tests) were detected between the Adh1 and Adh2 regions. Even when nonrandom association was tested for the strains belonging to one of the divergent sequence types of the Adh2 region, significant interlocus linkage disequilibria were detected. The close physical distance and/or epistasis between the two Adh regions could be invoked to explain these nonrandom associations.
16443696	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Lignin content and composition are two important agronomic traits for the utilization of agricultural residues. Rice (Oryza sativa) gold hull and internode phenotype is a classical morphological marker trait that has long been applied to breeding and genetics study. In this study, we have cloned the GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 (GH2) gene in rice using a map-based cloning approach. The result shows that the gh2 mutant is a lignin-deficient mutant, and GH2 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity. When expressed in Escherichia coli, purified recombinant GH2 was found to exhibit strong catalytic ability toward coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde, while the mutant protein gh2 completely lost the corresponding CAD and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Further phenotypic analysis of the gh2 mutant plants revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and sinapyl monomers were reduced in almost the same ratio compared to the wild type. Our results suggest GH2 acts as a primarily multifunctional CAD to synthesize coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol precursors in rice lignin biosynthesis.
16525890	The rice OsRad21-4, an orthologue of yeast Rec8 protein, is required for efficient meiosis.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	In yeast, Rad21/Scc1 and its meiotic variant Rec8 are key players in the establishment and subsequent dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion for mitosis and meiosis, respectively, which are essential for chromosome segregation. Unlike yeast, our identification revealed that the rice genome has 4 RAD21-like genes that share lower than 21% identity at polypeptide levels, and each is present as a single copy in this genome. Here we describe our analysis of the function of OsRAD21-4 by RNAi. Western blot analyses indicated that the protein was most abundant in young flowers and less in leaves and buds but absent in roots. In flowers, the expression was further defined to premeiotic pollen mother cells (PMCs) and meiotic PMCs of anthers. Meiotic chromosome behaviors were monitored from male meiocytes of OsRAD21-4-deficient lines mediated by RNAi. The male meiocytes showed multiple aberrant events at meiotic prophase I, including over-condensation of chromosomes, precocious segregation of homologues and chromosome fragmentation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the deficient lines were defective in homologous pairing and cohesion at sister chromatid arms. These defects resulted in unequal chromosome segregation and aberrant spore generation. These observations suggest that OsRad21-4 is essential for efficient meiosis.
16753814	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	DNA Seq	The full-length cDNA (3612 bp) of OsNHA1 was cloned by RT-PCR approach from rice (Oryza sativa L.), which encodes a putative plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter. Its deduced protein, OsNHA1, has 11 transmembrane domains and a significant similarity to a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHA1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the OsNHA1 clusters with the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporters from various organisms. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress.
16399803	ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that epoxidizes gibberellins in a novel deactivation reaction in rice.	2006	Plant Cell	The recessive tall rice (Oryza sativa) mutant elongated uppermost internode (eui) is morphologically normal until its final internode elongates drastically at the heading stage. The stage-specific developmental effect of the eui mutation has been used in the breeding of hybrid rice to improve the performance of heading in male sterile cultivars. We found that the eui mutant accumulated exceptionally large amounts of biologically active gibberellins (GAs) in the uppermost internode. Map-based cloning revealed that the Eui gene encodes a previously uncharacterized cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP714D1. Using heterologous expression in yeast, we found that EUI catalyzed 16alpha,17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs. Consistent with the tall and dwarfed phenotypes of the eui mutant and Eui-overexpressing transgenic plants, respectively, 16alpha,17-epoxidation reduced the biological activity of GA(4) in rice, demonstrating that EUI functions as a GA-deactivating enzyme. Expression of Eui appeared tightly regulated during plant development, in agreement with the stage-specific eui phenotypes. These results indicate the existence of an unrecognized pathway for GA deactivation by EUI during the growth of wild-type internodes. The identification of Eui as a GA catabolism gene provides additional evidence that the GA metabolism pathway is a useful target for increasing the agronomic value of crops.
17090310	SmTRC1, a novel Schistosoma mansoni DNA transposon, discloses new families of animal and fungi transposons belonging to the CACTA superfamily.	2006	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: The CACTA (also called En/Spm) superfamily of DNA-only transposons contain the core sequence CACTA in their Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and so far have only been described in plants. Large transcriptome and genome sequence data have recently become publicly available for Schistosoma mansoni, a digenetic blood fluke that is a major causative agent of schistosomiasis in humans, and have provided a comprehensive repository for the discovery of novel genes and repetitive elements. Despite the extensive description of retroelements in S. mansoni, just a single DNA-only transposon belonging to the Merlin family has so far been reported in this organism.

RESULTS: We describe a novel S. mansoni transposon named SmTRC1, for S. mansoni Transposon Related to CACTA 1, an element that shares several characteristics with plant CACTA transposons. Southern blotting indicates approximately 30-300 copies of SmTRC1 in the S. mansoni genome. Using genomic PCR followed by cloning and sequencing, we amplified and characterized a full-length and a truncated copy of this element. RT-PCR using S. mansoni mRNA followed by cloning and sequencing revealed several alternatively spliced transcripts of this transposon, resulting in distinct ORFs coding for different proteins. Interestingly, a survey of complete genomes from animals and fungi revealed several other novel TRC elements, indicating new families of DNA transposons belonging to the CACTA superfamily that have not previously been reported in these kingdoms. The first three bases in the S. mansoni TIR are CCC and they are identical to those in the TIRs of the insects Aedes aegypti and Tribolium castaneum, suggesting that animal TRCs may display a CCC core sequence.

CONCLUSION: The DNA-only transposable element SmTRC1 from S. mansoni exhibits various characteristics, such as generation of multiple alternatively-spliced transcripts, the presence of terminal inverted repeats at the extremities of the elements flanked by direct repeats and the presence of a Transposase_21 domain, that suggest a distant relationship to CACTA transposons from Magnoliophyta. Several sequences from other Metazoa and Fungi code for proteins similar to those encoded by SmTRC1, suggesting that such elements have a common ancestry, and indicating inheritance through vertical transmission before separation of the Eumetazoa, Fungi and Plants.
17289016	ORYZA SATIVA MYOSIN XI B controls pollen development by photoperiod-sensitive protein localizations.	2007	Dev Biol	Myosins are actin-based motor proteins responsible for various motility and signal transduction. Only a small set of myosin classes is present inplants, and little is known about their functions. Here we showed how a rice myosin gene controlled pollen development by sensing changed environmental factors. The analysis is based on a gene-trapped Ds insertion mutant Oryza sativa myosin XI B (osmyoXIB). This mutant showed male sterility under short day length (SD) conditions and fertility under long day length (LD) conditions. Under both SD and LD conditions, the OSMYOXIB transcript was detected in whole anthers. However, under SD conditions, the OSMYOXIB-GUS fusion protein was localized only in the epidermal layer of anthers due to the lack of 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and to dilute (DIL) domain sequences following the Ds insertion. As a result, mutant pollen development was affected, leading to male sterility. By contrast, under LD conditions, the fusion protein was localized normally in anthers. Despite normal localization, the protein was only partially functional due to the lack of DIL domain sequences, resulting in limited recovery of pollen fertility. This study also provides a case for a novel molecular aspect of gene expression, i.e., cell layer-specific translation in anthers.
17076258	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-beta receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins.	2006	DNA Seq	We describe the cloning and identification of a rice cDNA, OsTVLP1, encoding a protein with similarity to TGF-beta receptor interacting proteins and vacuolar assembly Vam6p/Vps39p proteins. OsTVLP1 has an open reading frame of 2955 bp, which encodes a 984 amino acid protein, containing a citron homology (CNH) domain at its N-terminal and a clathrin heavy-chain repeat homology (CLH) domain at its C-terminal. The expression of OsTVLP1 was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Importantly, the expression of OsTVLP1 was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus. Our observations suggest that OsTVLP1 may play a role in rice disease resistance response against pathogen infection.
17312944	Alternative splicing expression of U1 snRNP 70K gene is evolutionary conserved between different plant species.	2006	DNA Seq	A U1-snRNP--specific 70K (U1-70K) protein is intricately involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Here, we report cDNA and cognate genomic sequences of the U1-70K gene of maize and rice. The maize and rice U1-70K genes bear strong similarity to the Arabidopsis gene and each encode three transcripts in roots and shoots. Alternative splicing produces two transcripts from each gene in addition to the mRNA encoding the wild type protein. In both cases, selective inclusion of intron 6 or utilization of a cryptic donor site within intron 6 sequence generates the two alternatively spliced transcripts. This evolutionary conservation of splicing patterns between different plant species suggests an important biological function for alternative splicing in the expression of U1-70K gene.
17210932	Curated genome annotation of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and comparative genome analysis with Arabidopsis thaliana.	2007	Genome Res	We present here the annotation of the complete genome of rice Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cultivar Nipponbare. All functional annotations for proteins and non-protein-coding RNA (npRNA) candidates were manually curated. Functions were identified or inferred in 19,969 (70%) of the proteins, and 131 possible npRNAs (including 58 antisense transcripts) were found. Almost 5000 annotated protein-coding genes were found to be disrupted in insertional mutant lines, which will accelerate future experimental validation of the annotations. The rice loci were determined by using cDNA sequences obtained from rice and other representative cereals. Our conservative estimate based on these loci and an extrapolation suggested that the gene number of rice is approximately 32,000, which is smaller than previous estimates. We conducted comparative analyses between rice and Arabidopsis thaliana and found that both genomes possessed several lineage-specific genes, which might account for the observed differences between these species, while they had similar sets of predicted functional domains among the protein sequences. A system to control translational efficiency seems to be conserved across large evolutionary distances. Moreover, the evolutionary process of protein-coding genes was examined. Our results suggest that natural selection may have played a role for duplicated genes in both species, so that duplication was suppressed or favored in a manner that depended on the function of a gene.
16000456	Multilocus DNA sequence comparisons rapidly identify pathogenic molds.	2005	J Clin Microbiol	The increasing incidence of opportunistic fungal infections necessitates rapid and accurate identification of the associated fungi to facilitate optimal patient treatment. Traditional phenotype-based identification methods utilized in clinical laboratories rely on the production and recognition of reproductive structures, making identification difficult or impossible when these structures are not observed. We hypothesized that DNA sequence analysis of multiple loci is useful for rapidly identifying medically important molds. Our study included the analysis of the D1/D2 hypervariable region of the 28S ribosomal gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 of the rRNA operon. Two hundred one strains, including 143 clinical isolates and 58 reference and type strains, representing 43 recognized species and one possible new species, were examined. We generated a phenotypically validated database of 118 diagnostic alleles. DNA length polymorphisms detected among ITS1 and ITS2 PCR products can differentiate 20 of 33 species of molds tested, and ITS DNA sequence analysis permits identification of all species tested. For 42 of 44 species tested, conspecific strains displayed >99% sequence identity at ITS1 and ITS2; sequevars were detected in two species. For all 44 species, identifications by genotypic and traditional phenotypic methods were 100% concordant. Because dendrograms based on ITS sequence analysis are similar in topology to 28S-based trees, we conclude that ITS sequences provide phylogenetically valid information and can be utilized to identify clinically important molds. Additionally, this phenotypically validated database of ITS sequences will be useful for identifying new species of pathogenic molds.
15781441	Expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in iron-deficient rice is co-ordinately induced by partially conserved iron-deficiency-responsive elements.	2005	J Exp Bot	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) utilize the iron chelators known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the rhizosphere. Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role.
17216491	Cloning and characterization of the ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3) gene family from Triticum aestivum.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium can cause severe diseases on small grain cereals and maize. The contamination of harvested grain with Fusarium mycotoxins is a threat to human and animal health. In wheat production of the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, is a virulence factor of Fusarium, and resistance against DON is considered to be part of Fusarium resistance. Previously, single amino acid changes in RPL3 (ribosomal protein L3) conferring DON resistance have been described in yeast. The goal of this work was to characterize the RPL3 gene family from wheat and to investigate the potential role of naturally existing RPL3 alleles in DON resistance by comparing Fusarium-resistant and susceptible cultivars. The gene family consists of three homoeologous alleles of both RPL3A and RPL3B, which are located on chromosomes 4A (RPL3-B2), 4B (RPL3-B1), 4D (RPL3-B3), 5A (RPL3-A3), 5B (RPL3-A2) and 5D (RPL3-A1). Alternative splicing was detected in the TaRPL3-A2 gene. Sequence comparison revealed no amino acid differences between cultivars differing in Fusarium resistance. While using developed SNP markers we nevertheless found that one of the genes, namely, TaRPL3-A3 mapped close to a Fusarium resistance QTL (Qfhs.ifa-5A). The potential role of the RPL3 gene family in DON resistance of wheat is discussed.
17324757	Polyphasic approach to the taxonomy of the Rhizopus stolonifer group.	2007	Mycol Res	Phylogenetic analysis of Rhizopus strains based on the D1/D2 region of LSU rDNA sequences yielded a phylogram with four well-supported clades. The R. microsporus clade concurs with classification obtained by traditional methods. The R. oryzae group was found to include species of the genus Amylomyces. The traditional R. stolonifer group was divided into two well-supported clades in the phylogram, with one clade comprising R. stolonifer var. stolonifer, R. sexualis var. sexualis, and R. sexualis var. americanus and the other clade comprising taxa with recurved sporangiophores; R. reflexus, R. stolonifer var. lyococcus, and R. circinans, identifying recurved sporangiophores as an important taxonomic character. The molecular data supported the recognition of this clade at the species level: R. lyococcus (basionym: Sporotrichum lyococcum).
17417637	A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase.	2007	Nat Genet	Grain weight is one of the most important components of grain yield and is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in crops. However, the molecular roles of QTLs in the regulation of grain weight have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight. Our data show that GW2 encodes a previously unknown RING-type protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is known to function in the degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield. Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis. The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops.
17141283	Functional characterization of the rice kaurene synthase-like gene family.	2007	Phytochemistry	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains a family of kaurene synthase-like genes (OsKSL) presumably involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis. While a number of OsKSL enzymes have been functionally characterized, several have not been previously investigated, and the gene family has not been broadly analyzed. Here we report cloning of several OsKSL genes and functional characterization of the encoded enzymes. In particular, we have verified the expected production of ent-kaur-16-ene by the gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis associated OsKS1 and demonstrated that OsKSL3 is a pseudo-gene, while OsKSL5 and OsKSL6 produce ent-(iso)kaur-15-ene. Similar to previous reports, we found that our sub-species variant of OsKSL7 produces ent-cassa-12,15-diene, OsKSL10 produces ent-(sandaraco)pimar-8(14),15-diene, and OsKSL8 largely syn-stemar-13-ene, although we also identified syn-stemod-12-ene as an alternative product formed in approximately 20% of the reactions catalyzed by OsKSL8. Along with our previous reports identifying OsKSL4 as a syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase and OsKSL11 as a syn-stemod-13(17)-ene synthase, this essentially completes biochemical characterization of the OsKSL gene family, enabling broader analyses. For example, because several OsKSL enzymes are involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis and their gene transcription is inducible, promoter analysis was used to identify a pair of specifically conserved motifs that may be involved in transcriptional up-regulation during the rice plant defense response. Also examined is the continuing process of gene evolution in the OsKSL gene family, which is particularly interesting in the context of very recently reported data indicating that a japonica sub-species variant of OsKSL5 produces ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene, rather than the ent-(iso)kaur-15-ene produced by the indica sub-species variant analyzed here.
17144896	The rice heterochronic gene SUPERNUMERARY BRACT regulates the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem.	2007	Plant J	Regulating the transition of meristem identity is a critical step in reproductive development. After the shoot apical meristem (SAM) acquires inflorescence meristem identity, it goes through a sequential transition to second- and higher-order meristems that can eventually give rise to floral organs. Despite ample information on the molecular mechanisms that control the transition from SAM to inflorescence meristems, little is known about the mechanism for inflorescence development, especially in monocots. Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development. This gene encodes a putative transcription factor carrying two AP2 domains. The SNB:GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in the newly emerging spikelet meristems. In SNB knockout plants, the transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative phyllotaxy. The development of additional bracts interferes with subsequent floral architecture. In some spikelets, the empty glumes and lodicules are transformed into lemma/palea-like organs. Occasionally, the number of stamens and carpels is altered and an ectopic floret occurs in the axil of the rachilla. These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant, affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy.
17217421	Factors influencing cell fate in the infarct rim.	2007	J Neurochem	In focal ischemia, the fate of penumbral cells is closely linked to the infarcted tissue. Because of the release of cytosolic material from damaged cells, the biochemical and ionic alterations within the core are dramatic. Hence, adjacent cells ( infarct rim) are generally exposed to these changes and may be deleteriously affected. To mimic such conditions in vitro, we have employed a slice culture system and used an ischemic solution (IS) that resembles the milieu in the territory of infarct rim. In contrast to normal artificial cerebral spinal fluid, IS is characterized by low O(2), glucose, pH; excitotoxic levels of glutamate; and ionic alterations. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we examined cell injury/death using propidium iodide following exposure to IS. Our data show significant cell injury starting at approximately 8 h following IS exposure with cell injury spreading as a function of exposure duration. We further studied the effect of each component in the IS separately, i.e., acidosis, hypoxia, ionic shifts or glutamate exitotoxicity and were able to isolate the contribution of each of these effectors to the IS-induced cell death. Our results suggest that in IS, acidosis exacerbates the potential for injury while ionic shifts, especially those of K(+) and Na(+), alleviate the potential for cell death.
17355435	Identification and functional characterization of cation-chloride cotransporters in plants.	2007	Plant J	Chloride (Cl(-)) is an essential nutrient and one of the most abundant inorganic anions in plant tissues. We have cloned an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding for a member of the cation-Cl(-) cotransporter (CCC) family. Deduced plant CCC proteins are highly conserved, and phylogenetic analyses revealed their relationships to the sub-family of animal K(+):Cl(-) cotransporters. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, the A. thaliana CCC protein (At CCC) catalysed the co-ordinated symport of K(+), Na(+) and Cl(-), and this transport activity was inhibited by the 'loop' diuretic bumetanide, a specific inhibitor of vertebrate Na(+):K(+):Cl(-) cotransporters, indicating that At CCC encodes for a bona fide Na(+):K(+):Cl(-) cotransporter. Analysis of At CCC promoter-beta-glucuronidase transgenic Arabidopsis plants revealed preferential expression in the root and shoot vasculature at the xylem/symplast boundary, root tips, trichomes, leaf hydathodes, leaf stipules and anthers. Plants homozygous for two independent T-DNA insertions in the CCC gene exhibited shorter organs such as inflorescence stems, roots, leaves and siliques. The elongation zone of the inflorescence stem of ccc plants often necrosed during bolt emergence, while seed production was strongly impaired. In addition, ccc plants exhibited defective Cl(-) homeostasis under high salinity, as they accumulated higher and lower Cl(-) amounts in shoots and roots, respectively, than the treated wild type, suggesting At CCC involvement in long-distance Cl(-) transport. Compelling evidence is provided on the occurrence of cation-chloride cotransporters in the plant kingdom and their significant role in major plant developmental processes and Cl(-) homeostasis.
17142477	Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice.	2007	Plant Physiol	The salt tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa) correlates with the ability to exclude Na+ from the shoot and to maintain a low cellular Na+/K+ ratio. We have identified a rice plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger that, on the basis of genetic and biochemical criteria, is the functional homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1) protein. The rice transporter, denoted by OsSOS1, demonstrated a capacity for Na+/H+ exchange in plasma membrane vesicles of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and reduced their net cellular Na+ content. The Arabidopsis protein kinase complex SOS2/SOS3, which positively controls the activity of AtSOS1, phosphorylated OsSOS1 and stimulated its activity in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, OsSOS1 suppressed the salt sensitivity of a sos1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis. These results represent the first molecular and biochemical characterization of a Na+ efflux protein from monocots. Putative rice homologs of the Arabidopsis protein kinase SOS2 and its Ca2+-dependent activator SOS3 were identified also. OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4 acted coordinately to activate OsSOS1 in yeast cells and they could be exchanged with their Arabidopsis counterpart to form heterologous protein kinase modules that activated both OsSOS1 and AtSOS1 and suppressed the salt sensitivity of sos2 and sos3 mutants of Arabidopsis. These results demonstrate that the SOS salt tolerance pathway operates in cereals and evidences a high degree of structural conservation among the SOS proteins from dicots and monocots.
17219210	Large-scale DNA polymorphism study of Oryza sativa and O. rufipogon reveals the origin and divergence of Asian rice.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	Polymorphism over approximately 26 kb of DNA sequence spanning 22 loci and one region distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 4 was studied in 30 accessions of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and its wild relatives. Phylogenetic analysis using all the DNA sequences suggested that O. sativa ssp. indica and ssp. japonica were independently domesticated from a wild species O. rufipogon. O. sativa ssp. indica contained substantial genetic diversity (pi = 0.0024), whereas ssp. japonica exhibited extremely low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0001) suggesting the origin of the latter from a small number of founders. O. sativa ssp. japonica contained a larger number of derived and fixed non-synonymous substitutions as compared to ssp. indica. Nucleotide diversity and genealogical history substantially varied across the 22 loci. A locus, RLD15 on chromosome 2, showed a distinct genealogy with ssp. japonica sequences distantly separated from those of O. rufipogon and O. sativa ssp. indica. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was analyzed in two different regions. LD in O. rufipogon decays within 5 kb, whereas it extends to approximately 50 kb in O. sativa ssp. indica.
17287810	Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme.	2007	Nature	The growth of plants depends on continuous function of the meristems. Shoot meristems are responsible for all the post-embryonic aerial organs, such as leaves, stems and flowers. It has been assumed that the phytohormone cytokinin has a positive role in shoot meristem function. A severe reduction in the size of meristems in a mutant that is defective in all of its cytokinin receptors has provided compelling evidence that cytokinin is required for meristem activity. Here, we report a novel regulation of meristem activity, which is executed by the meristem-specific activation of cytokinins. The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem. LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis. Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity. LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain. We propose the fine-tuning of concentrations and the spatial distribution of bioactive cytokinins by a cytokinin-activating enzyme as a mechanism that regulates meristem activity.
15685364	Computational identification of novel family members of microRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2005	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small RNAs that play important regulatory roles in both animals and plants. miRNA genes have been intensively studied in animals, but not in plants. In this study, we adopted a homology search approach to identify homologs of previously validated plant miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We identified 20 potential miRNA genes in Arabidopsis and 40 in O. sativa, providing a relatively complete enumeration of family members for these miRNAs in plants. In addition, a greater number of Arabidopsis miRNAs (MIR168, MIR159 and MIR172) were found to be conserved in rice. With the novel homologs, most of the miRNAs have closely related fellow miRNAs and the number of paralogs varies in the different miRNA families. Moreover, a probable functional segment highly conserved on the elongated stem of pre-miRNA fold-backs of MIR319 and MIR159 family was identified. These results support a model of variegated miRNA regulation in plants, in which miRNAs with different functional elements on their pre-miRNA fold-backs can differ in their function or regulation, and closely related miRNAs can be diverse in their specificity or competence to downregulate target genes. It appears that the sophisticated regulation of miRNAs can achieve complex biological effects through qualitative and quantitative modulation of gene expression profiles in plants.
1368748	Isolation and characterization of the alkaline protease gene of Aspergillus oryzae.	1991	Agric Biol Chem	The genomic DNA for the alkaline protease (Alp) of the fungus Aspergillus oryzae was isolated using synthetic oligonucleotides as hydridization probes, and the complete nucleotide sequence was identified. The Alp gene is 1374 nucleotides long and contains three introns, one of which is in the pro region and two in the mature coding region. Sequences related to the TATA box (TATAAAT) and the CAAT box (CCAAAT) were found in the 5'-noncoding region. Primer extension analysis showed that three transcriptional start points are present.
9726865	Role of the regulatory gene areA of Aspergillus oryzae in nitrogen metabolism.	1998	Appl Environ Microbiol	The areA gene of Aspergillus oryzae was cloned by cross-hybridization with the Aspergillus nidulans areA gene and was found to encode an 866-amino-acid protein that is very similar to other fungal nitrogen regulatory proteins. The A. oryzae areA gene can complement A. nidulans areA loss-of-function mutations. Functional analyses indicated that the N-terminal region of the A. oryzae AreA protein was dispensable for function and revealed a probable acidic activation domain in the protein. C-terminal truncation of the protein resulted in derepression of several nitrogen-controlled activities in A. nidulans, while deletions extending into the conserved GATA type zinc finger region abolished the activator function. The A. oryzae areA gene was inactivated by replacement with the A. oryzae pyrG gene. Strains containing the resulting areA deletion grew as well as the wild-type strain on glutamine but were unable to grow vigorously on other nitrogen sources, including ammonium. While A. oryzae exhibited reduced growth on 10 mM ammonium, the results of growth tests indicated that areA mutants of both A. oryzae and A. nidulans were affected in utilization of low concentrations of ammonium. The levels of the major nitrogen assimilatory enzymes, NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4) and glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2), were determined. In both A. oryzae and A. nidulans areA mutants, the NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase levels were reduced, whereas the glutamine synthetase levels were not affected. These results suggest that the AreA protein may play an important role in the regulation of nitrogen assimilation in addition to its previously established regulatory role in nitrogen catabolism.
11526009	Heteroduplex panel analysis, a novel method for genetic identification of Aspergillus Section Flavi strains.	2001	Appl Environ Microbiol	For genetic identification of Aspergillus Section Flavi isolates and detection of intraspecific variation, we developed a novel method for heteroduplex panel analysis (HPA) utilizing fragments of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the rRNA gene that was PCR amplified with universal primers. The method involves formation of heteroduplexes with a set of reference fragments amplified from Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. tamarii, and A. nomius and subsequent minislab vinyl polymer gel electrophoresis. The test panel is compared with species-specific standard panels (F-1, P-1, T-1, and N-1) generated by pairwise reannealing among four reference fragments. Of 90 test panels, 89 succeeded in identifying the species and 74 were identical to one of the four standard panels. Of the 16 new panels, 11 A. flavus/A. oryzae panels were identical and typed as F-2 and 4 of 5 A. nomius panels were typed as N-2 or N-3. The other strain, A. nomius IMI 358749, was unable to identify the species because no single bands were formed with any of the four reference strains. DNA sequencing revealed that our HPA method has the highest sensitivity available and is able to detect as little as one nucleotide of diversity within the species. When Penicillium or non-Section Flavi Aspergillus was subjected to HPA, the resulting bands of heteroduplexes showed apparently lower mobility and poor heteroduplex formation. This indicates that HPA is a useful identification method without morphological observation and is suitable for rapid and inexpensive screening of large numbers of isolates. The HPA typing coincided with the taxonomy of Section Flavi and is therefore applicable as an alternative to the conventional methods (Samson, R. A., E. S. Hoekstra, J. C. Frisvad, and O. Filtenborg, p. 64-97, in Introduction to Food- and Airborne Fungi, 6th ed., 2000).
16597938	Novel hydrophobic surface binding protein, HsbA, produced by Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Appl Environ Microbiol	Hydrophobic surface binding protein A (HsbA) is a secreted protein (14.5 kDa) isolated from the culture broth of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 grown in a medium containing polybutylene succinate-co-adipate (PBSA) as a sole carbon source. We purified HsbA from the culture broth and determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence. We found a DNA sequence encoding a protein whose N terminus matched that of purified HsbA in the A. ozyzae genomic sequence. We cloned the hsbA genomic DNA and cDNA from A. oryzae and constructed a recombinant A. oryzae strain highly expressing hsbA. Orthologues of HsbA were present in animal pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi. Heterologously synthesized HsbA was purified and biochemically characterized. Although the HsbA amino acid sequence suggests that HsbA may be hydrophilic, HsbA adsorbed to hydrophobic PBSA surfaces in the presence of NaCl or CaCl(2). When HsbA was adsorbed on the hydrophobic PBSA surfaces, it promoted PBSA degradation via the CutL1 polyesterase. CutL1 interacts directly with HsbA attached to the hydrophobic QCM electrode surface. These results suggest that when HsbA is adsorbed onto the PBSA surface, it recruits CutL1, and that when CutL1 is accumulated on the PBSA surface, it stimulates PBSA degradation. We previously reported that when the A. oryzae hydrophobin RolA is bound to PBSA surfaces, it too specifically recruits CutL1. Since HsbA is not a hydrophobin, A. oryzae may use several types of proteins to recruit lytic enzymes to the surface of hydrophobic solid materials and promote their degradation.
16391082	Molecular analysis of an inactive aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae RIB strains.	2006	Appl Environ Microbiol	To help assess the potential for aflatoxin production by Aspergillus oryzae, the structure of an aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homolog cluster in A. oryzae RIB 40 was analyzed. Although most genes in the corresponding cluster exhibited from 97 to 99% similarity to those of Aspergillus flavus, three genes shared 93% similarity or less. A 257-bp deletion in the aflT region, a frameshift mutation in norA, and a base pair substitution in verA were found in A. oryzae RIB 40. In the aflR promoter, two substitutions were found in one of the three putative AreA binding sites and in the FacB binding site. PCR primers were designed to amplify homologs of aflT, nor-1, aflR, norA, avnA, verB, and vbs and were used to detect these genes in 210 A. oryzae strains. Based on the PCR results, the A. oryzae RIB strains were classified into three groups, although most of them fell into two of the groups. Group 1, in which amplification of all seven genes was confirmed, contained 122 RIB strains (58.1% of examined strains), including RIB 40. Seventy-seven strains (36.7%) belonged to group 2, characterized by having only vbs, verB, and avnA in half of the cluster. Although slight expression of aflR was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in some group 1 strains, including RIB 40, other genes (avnA, vbs, verB, and omtA) related to aflatoxin production were not detected. aflR was not detected in group 2 strains by Southern analysis.
8597544	Cloning, characterization and overproduction of nuclease S1 gene (nucS) from Aspergillus oryzae.	1995	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The nuclease S1 gene (nucS) from Aspergillus oryzae was isolated using a polymerase-chain-reaction-amplified DNA fragment as a probe, and a 2.6-kb SalI-EcoRI fragment containing the nucS gene was sequenced. It was deduced that the nucS gene had two short introns, 49 and 50 nucleotides in length. The nucS gene had an open-reading frame of 963 base pairs and coded for a protein of 287 amino acid residues, comprising the signal peptide of 20 amino acids and a mature protein of 267 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence agreed well with the published amino acid sequence except for one substitution. Southern hybridization analysis showed that the nucS gene existed as a single copy in the A. oryzae chromosome. When the structural gene of nucS was fused with the promoter of the glaA gene and introduced into A. oryzae, the yield of secreted nuclease S1 increased about 100-fold compared with the recipient strain.
16673111	Aspergillus oryzae strains with a large deletion of the aflatoxin biosynthetic homologous gene cluster differentiated by chromosomal breakage.	2006	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Recently we divided Aspergillus oryzae RIB strains into group 1, having seven aflatoxin biosynthesis homologous genes (aflT, nor-1, aflR, norA, avnA, verB, and vbs), and group 2, having three homologues (avnA, verB, and vbs). Here, partial aflatoxin homologous gene cluster of RIB62 from group 2 was sequenced and compared with that of RIB40 from group 1. RIB62 showed a large deletion upstream of ver-1 with more than half of the aflatoxin homologous gene cluster missing including aflR, a positive transcriptional regulatory gene. Adjacent to the deletion of the aflatoxin homologous gene cluster, RIB62 has a unique sequence of about 8 kb and a telomere. Southern analysis of A. oryzae RIB strains with four kinds of probe derived from the unique sequence of RIB62 showed that all group 2 strains have identical hybridizing signals. Polymerase chain reaction with specific primer set designed to amplify the junction between ver-1 and the unique sequence of RIB62 resulted in the same size of DNA fragment only from group 2 strains. Based on these results, we developed a useful genetic tool that distinguishes A. oryzae group 2 strains from the other groups' strains and propose that it might have differentiated from the ancestral strains due to chromosomal breakage.
16804680	Plasmids for expression of heterologous proteins in Rhizopus oryzae.	2006	Arch Microbiol	Rhizopus oryzae has long been used for enzyme production (e.g., glucoamylase and lipase), organic acid synthesis, and various fermented food applications. In this work, we describe a set of plasmid-based expression vectors that can be used for the production of heterologous proteins in R. oryzae. Three plasmid vectors have been created using either the glucoamylase A (amyA), pyruvate decarboxylase (pdcA), or phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk1) promoters to drive expression of heterologous proteins. All three plasmids use the pdcA terminator for transcription termination, the pyrG gene for restoration of uracil prototrophy, and an ampicillin resistance gene and origin of replication for maintenance in Escherichia coli. We have expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) and compared transcription and protein accumulation for each of the expression vectors. Accumulation of GFP transcript and protein was directly correlated with the choice of promoter with pdcA > amyA > pgk1. Transcript level appears to parallel GFP protein accumulation. Plasmid copy number had little impact on transcription or protein accumulation. These vectors should be useful for overexpression of heterologous proteins and potentially, metabolic engineering of Rhizopus strains.
16380079	Visualization of the endocytic pathway in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae using an EGFP-fused plasma membrane protein.	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Endocytosis is an important process for cellular activities. However, in filamentous fungi, the existence of endocytosis has been so far elusive. In this study, we used AoUapC-EGFP, the fusion protein of a putative uric acid-xanthine permease with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in Aspergillus oryzae, to examine whether the endocytic process occurs or not. Upon the addition of ammonium into the medium the fusion protein was internalized from the plasma membrane. The internalization of AoUapC-EGFP was completely blocked by sodium azide, cold, and cytochalasin A treatments, suggesting that the internalization possesses the general features of endocytosis. These results demonstrate the occurrence of endocytosis in filamentous fungi. Moreover, we discovered that the endosomal compartments appeared upon the induction of endocytosis and moved in a microtubule-dependent manner.
16857172	Aovps24, a homologue of VPS24, is required for vacuolar formation which could maintain proper growth and development in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Vps24 (vacuolar protein sorting) is a component of ESCRT III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), which is required for the formation of MVB (multivesicular body). We have isolated the VPS24 homologue gene, Aovps24, from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, and analyzed the localization of AoVps24 using EGFP. AoVps24 was localized in the cytoplasm and late endosome-like structures. Furthermore, we constructed an Aovps24 disruptant, which showed impaired growth, conidiation, and hyphal morphology. In addition, normal vacuoles were not observed in the Aovps24 disruptant. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vps24 disruptant, the normal vacuoles are formed and it does not show the impaired growth and abnormal cell shape as the A. oryzae Aovps24 disruptant. The results suggest that AoVps24 is required for vacuolar formation and normal vacuoles could have the function to maintain the normal hyphal elongation and conidiation in A. oryzae.
16428831	Identification and analysis of Ku70 and Ku80 homologs in the koji molds Aspergillus sojae and Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Ku genes play a key role in the non-homologous end-joining pathway. We have identified Ku70 and Ku80 homologs in the koji molds Aspergillus sojae and Aspergillus oryzae, and have constructed the disruption mutants of Ku70, Ku80, and Ku70-80 to characterize the phenotypic change in these mutants. Neither Ku70- nor Ku80-disrupted strains show hypersensitivity to the DNA damaging agents methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and phleomycin. Moreover, undesirable phenotypes, such as poor growth or repressed conidiospore formation, were not observed in the Ku-disrupted A. sojae and A. oryzae.
7763981	Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the acid protease-encoding gene (pepA) from Aspergillus oryzae.	1993	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We have cloned a genomic DNA sequence encoding the acid protease (PEPA) from Aspergillus oryzae using a 0.6-kb fragment as a probe. This fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers designed from the partial amino acid sequences of peptide fragments of the purified protein. Nucleotide sequencing analysis has shown that the cloned gene (designated pepA) encodes 404 amino acid residues and contains 3 putative introns ranging in length from 50 to 61 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence of the A. oryzae PEPA has a high degree of homology (67%) to the A. awamori PEPA. Comparison with the amino acid sequence of A. awamori PEPA suggests that the A. oryzae PEPA may consist of a 78 amino acid prepro-peptide and 326 amino acid mature protein. The amino acid composition of the mature protein was almost consistent with that of the acid protease purified from A. oryzae reported previously. Southern hybridization analyses showed that the pepA gene exists as a single copy in the A. oryzae chromosome. The cloned gene was found to be functional, since transformants of A. oryzae containing multiple copies of the pepA gene showed a 2-6 fold increase in acid protease activity compared with the recipient strain.
12951506	rDNA ITS sequence of Rhizopus oryzae: its application to classification and identification of lactic acid producers.	2003	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rhizopus oryzae is an important organism for its production of organic acids such as lactic acid, fumaric acid, etc. To date, there were no easy methods to classify strains according to their acid production. The sequences of the ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 64 strains of R. oryzae were analyzed and found to conserve mutations correspond to acid production. We have devised a way to use these mutations for a novel method to identify lactic-acid-producing Rhizopus oryzae, by designing specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers on them. Touch down PCR using these primers amplified the ITS DNA of lactic acid producers specifically. By this method, we could isolate lactic acid producing strains from Indonesian fermented foods.
16880596	Development of a versatile expression plasmid construction system for Aspergillus oryzae and its application to visualization of mitochondria.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We report here a development of the MultiSite Gateway(TM)-based versatile plasmid construction system applicable for the rapid and efficient preparation of Aspergillus oryzae expression plasmids. This system allows the simultaneous connection of the three DNA fragments inserted in entry clones along with a destination vector in a defined order and orientation. We prepared a variety of entry clones and destination vectors containing promoters, genes encoding carrier-proteins and fusion tags, and selectable markers, which makes it possible to generate 80 expression plasmids for each target protein. Using this system, plasmids for expression of the EGFP fused with the mitochondrial-targeting signal of citrate synthase (AoCit1) were generated. Tubular structures of mitochondria were visualized in the transformants expressing the AoCit1-EGFP fusion protein. This plasmid construction system allows us to prepare a large number of expression plasmids without laborious DNA manipulations, which would facilitate molecular biological studies on A. oryzae.
17031057	The molecular phylogeny of the genus Rhizopus based on rDNA sequences.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	In order to establish the molecular phylogeny of the genus Rhizopus, three molecules of the ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA (rDNA), complete 18S, internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1-5.8S-ITS2, and 28S D1/D2 regions of all the species of the genus were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees showed three major clusters corresponding to the three groups in the current morphological taxonomy, microsporus-group, stolonifer-group, and R. oryzae. R. stolonifer var. lyococcos was clustered independently from the major clusters. R. schipperae clustered differently in all trees. Strains of R. sexualis had multiple ITS sequences. A. rouxii clustered with R. oryzae. These results indicate the possibility of molecular identification of species groups using rDNA sequencing. Reclassification of the genus might be appropriate.
16495665	Cloning and expression of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase gene (fmanIB) from filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae: in vivo visualization of the FmanIBp-GFP fusion protein.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	1,2-alpha-Mannosidase catalyzes the specific cleavage of 1,2-alpha-mannose residues from protein-linked N-glycan. In this study, a novel DNA sequence homologous to the authentic 1,2-alpha-mannosidase was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from solid-state cultured Aspergillus oryzae. The fmanIB cDNA consisted of 1530 nucleotides and encoded a protein of 510 amino acids in which all consensus motifs of the class I alpha-mannosidase were conserved. Expression of the full length of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase cDNA by the Aspergillus host, though it has rarely been done with other filamentous-fungal mannosidase, was successful with fmanIB and caused an increase in both intracellular and extracellular mannosidase activity. The expressed protein (FmanIBp) specifically hydrolyzed 1,2-alpha-mannobiose with maximal activity at a pH of 5.5 and a temperature of 45 degrees C. With Man(9)GlcNAc(2) as the substrate, Man(5)GlcNAc(2) finally accumulated while hydrolysis of the 1,2-alpha-mannose residue of the middle branch was rate-limiting. To examine the intracellular localization of the enzyme, a chimeric protein of FmanIBp with green fluorescent protein was constructed. It showed a dotted fluorescence pattern in the mycelia of Aspergillus, indicative of the localization in intracellular vesicles. Based on these enzymatic and microscopic results, we estimated that FmanIBp is a fungal substitute for the mammalian Golgi 1,2-alpha-mannosidase isozyme IB. This and our previous report on the presence of another ER-type mannosidase in A. oryzae (Yoshida et al., 2000) support the notion that the filamentous fungus has similar steps of N-linked glycochain trimming to those in mammalian cells.
16699570	Development of AFLP-derived, functionally specific markers for environmental persistence studies of fungal strains.	2006	Can J Microbiol	The ability to rapidly identify and quantify a microbial strain in a complex environmental sample has widespread applications in ecology, epidemiology, and industry. In this study, we describe a rapid method to obtain functionally specific genetic markers that can be used in conjunction with standard or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the abundance of target fungal strains in selected environmental samples. The method involves sequencing of randomly cloned AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) products from the target organism and the design of PCR primers internal to the AFLP fragments. The strain-specific markers were used to determine the fate of three industrially relevant fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, and Chaetomium globosum, during a 4 month soil microcosm experiment. The persistence of each of the three fungal strains inoculated separately into intact soil microcosms was determined by PCR analyses of DNA directly extracted from soil. Presence and absence data based on standard PCR and quantification of the target DNA by real-time PCR showed that all three strains declined after inoculation (approximately 14-, 32-, and 4-fold for A. niger, A. oryzae, and C. globosum, respectively) but remained detectable at the end of the experiment, suggesting that these strains would survive for extended periods if released into nature.
2688930	A gene transfer system based on the homologous pyrG gene and efficient expression of bacterial genes in Aspergillus oryzae.	1989	Curr Genet	A homologous transformation system for Aspergillus oryzae is described. The system is based on an A. oryzae strain deficient in orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (pyrG) and the vector pAO4-2, which contains a functional A. oryzae pyrG gene as selection marker. Transformation of the A. oryzae pyrG mutant with circular pAO4-2 resulted in the appearance of Pyr+ transformants at a frequency of up to 20 per micrograms of DNA, whereas with linear pAO4-2 up to 200 transformants per micrograms DNA were obtained. In 75% of the Pyr+ transformants recombination events had occurred at the pyrG locus, most of which (90%) resulted in insertion of one or two copies of the vector and the others (10%) in a replacement of the mutant allele by the wild-type allele. Vector pAO4-2 is also capable of transforming a corresponding mutant of Aspergillus niger. This transformation system was used to introduce into A. oryzae the heterologous and non-selectable bacterial genes lacZ, encoding beta-galactosidase, and uidA, encoding beta-glucuronidase. Using the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter to drive bacterial gene expression in A. oryzae, relatively high levels of activity, as well as protein per se, as judged by western blot analyses, were obtained.
1913876	Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the genomic ribonuclease T2 gene (rntB) from Aspergillus oryzae.	1991	Curr Genet	Using synthetic oligonucleotide probes, we have cloned a genomic DNA sequence encoding a ribonuclease (RNase) T2 gene (rntB) from Aspergillus oryzae on a 4.8 kb HindIII fragment. DNA sequence analysis of the RNase T2 revealed the following: (1) The gene is arranged as five exons and four introns; (2) The deduced amino acid sequence contains 239 amino acid residues of the mature enzyme. In addition, there exist 17 amino acid residues thought to be a signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus and 20 amino acid residues at the C-terminus; (3) The nucleotide sequence of the rntB gene is homologous to those of the RNase Rh gene from Rhizopus niveus and the S2 stylar glycoprotein gene of Nicotiana alata with degree of about 51% and 47%, respectively; (4) A. oryzae and A. nidulans transformed with the cloned rntB gene had much higher ribonuclease T2 activity than wild-type strains.
8252646	A chloroplast DNA mutational hotspot and gene conversion in a noncoding region near rbcL in the grass family (Poaceae).	1993	Curr Genet	The noncoding DNA region of the chloroplast genome, flanked by the genes rbcL and psaI (ORF36), has been sequenced for seven species of the grass family (Poaceae). This region had previously been observed as a hotspot area for length mutations. Sequence comparison reveals that short duplications, probably resulting from slipped-strand mispairing, account for many small length differences between sequences but that major mutational hotspots are localized in three small areas, two of which show potential secondary structure. Mutation in one of these hotspots appears to be a result of more complex recombination events. All seven species contain a pseudogene for rpl23 and evidence is presented that this pseudogene is being maintained by gene conversion with the functional gene. Different transition/transversion biases and AT contents between the pseudogene and the surrounding noncoding sequences are noted. In the subfamily Panicoideae there is a deletion in which almost 1 kb of ancestral sequence, including the 3' end of the rpl23 pseudogene, has been replaced by a non-homologous 60-base sequence of unknown origin. Two other deletions of almost the same region have occurred in the grass family. The deleted noncoding region has mutational and compositional properties similar to the rbcL coding sequence and the rpl23 pseudogene. The three independent deletions, as well as the pattern of mutation in the localized hotspots, indicate that such noncoding DNA may be misleading for studies of phylogenetic inference.
7788722	The rps3-rpl16-nad3-rps12 gene cluster in rice mitochondrial DNA is transcribed from alternative promoters.	1995	Curr Genet	The two gene clusters rps3-rpl16 and nad3-rps12 are separated from each other in the mitochondrial genome and are expressed as the individual transcription units in many plants. In rice mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the four genes rps3, rpl16, nad3 and rps12 are located within a region of 6 kbp. Northern-blot analysis revealed that a large transcript (6.6 kb) hybridized to both the rps3-rpl16 and the nad3-rps12 gene clusters. Using RT-PCR, we amplified a fragment of anticipated size (790 bp) from two primers that corresponded to sequences in the coding regions of rpl16 and nad3, demonstrating that at least two of the four genes, namely rpl16 and nad3, were co-transcribed. These results together indicated that all four genes, namely, rps3, rpl16, nad3 and rps12, were co-transcribed in rice mitochondria. Transcription initiation sites were determined by an in vitro capping/ribonuclease protection assay and primer extension analysis. Two initiation sites were identified in the rps3-rpl16-nad3-rps12 gene cluster: one was located upstream of rps3 and the other was located between rpl16 and nad3. This evidence indicates that the rps3-rpl16-nad3-rps12 gene cluster is transcribed from two alternative promoters.
8988367	Novel DNA probes capable of discriminating indica and japonica rice cultivars.	1996	DNA Seq	We obtained two DNA clones, G93 (1.6kb) and G318 (1.7kb) from indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Culture 340. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that both DNA probes hybridized with DNA of indica cultivars but not with japonica cultivars. Some javanica cultivars DNAs did not hybridize with these probes. Nucleotide sequence (400bp) of a part of G93 showed a 65.8% G + C content. These novel DNA probes can be used for the study of evolutional fingerprinting of rice cultivars.
16896216	Functional analysis of the ATG8 homologue Aoatg8 and role of autophagy in differentiation and germination in Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Eukaryot Cell	Autophagy is a well-known degradation system, induced by nutrient starvation, in which cytoplasmic components and organelles are digested via vacuoles/lysosomes. Recently, it was reported that autophagy is involved in the turnover of cellular components, development, differentiation, immune responses, protection against pathogens, and cell death. In this study, we isolated the ATG8 gene homologue Aoatg8 from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae and visualized autophagy by the expression of DsRed2-AoAtg8 and enhanced green fluorescent protein-AoAtg8 fusion proteins in this fungus. While the fusion proteins were localized in dot structures which are preautophagosomal structure-like structures under normal growth conditions, starvation or rapamycin treatment caused their accumulation in vacuoles. DsRed2 expressed in the cytoplasm was also taken up into vacuoles under starvation conditions or during the differentiation of conidiophores and conidial germination. Deletion mutants of Aoatg8 did not form aerial hyphae and conidia, and DsRed2 was not localized in vacuoles under starvation conditions, indicating that Aoatg8 is essential for autophagy. Furthermore, Aoatg8 conditional mutants showed delayed conidial germination in the absence of nitrogen sources. These results suggest that autophagy functions in both the differentiation of aerial hyphae and in conidial germination in A. oryzae.
16467481	Vacuolar membrane dynamics in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Eukaryot Cell	Vacuoles in filamentous fungi are highly pleomorphic and some of them, e.g., tubular vacuoles, are implicated in intra- and intercellular transport. In this report, we isolated Aovam3, the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VAM3 gene that encodes the vacuolar syntaxin, from Aspergillus oryzae. In yeast complementation analyses, the expression of Aovam3 restored the phenotypes of both Deltavam3 and Deltapep12 mutants, suggesting that AoVam3p is likely the vacuolar and/or endosomal syntaxin in A. oryzae. FM4-64 [N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide] and CMAC (7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin) staining confirmed that the fusion protein of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with AoVam3p (EGFP-AoVam3p) localized on the membrane of the pleomorphic vacuolar networks, including large spherical vacuoles, tubular vacuoles, and putative late endosomes/prevacuolar compartments. EGFP-AoVam3p-expressing strains allowed us to observe the dynamics of vacuoles with high resolutions, and moreover, led to the discovery of several new aspects of fungal vacuoles, which have not been discovered so far with conventional staining methods, during different developmental stages. In old hyphae, EGFP fluorescence was present in the entire lumen of large vacuoles, which occupied most of the cell, indicating that degradation of cytosolic materials had occurred in such hyphae via an autophagic process. In hyphae that were not in contact with nutrients, such as aerial hyphae and hyphae that grew on a glass surface, vacuoles were composed of small punctate structures and tubular elements that often formed reticulum-like networks. These observations imply the presence of so-far-unrecognized roles of vacuoles in the development of filamentous fungi.
17116242	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2006	FEBS J	DNA topoisomerase 6 (TOP6) belongs to a novel family of type II DNA topoisomerases present, other than in archaebacteria, only in plants. Here we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs encoding putative TOP6 subunits A and B from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica), preserving all the structural domains conserved among archaebacterial TOP6 homologs and eukaryotic meiotic recombination factor SPO11. OsTOP6A1 was predominantly expressed in prepollinated flowers. The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus. The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1. The nuclear localization of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was established by the transient expression of their beta-glucuronidase fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells. Overexpression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to the stress hormone, abscisic acid, and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration. Moreover, the stress tolerance coincided with enhanced induction of many stress-responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In addition, microarray analysis revealed that a large number of genes are expressed differentially in transgenic plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TOP6 genes play a crucial role in stress adaptation of plants by altering gene expression.
15327973	Identification and characterization of a novel delta12-fatty acid desaturase gene from Rhizopus arrhizus.	2004	FEBS Lett	Based on the sequence information of Delta12-fatty acid desaturase genes (from Mucor circinelloides, Mortierella alpina, Mucor rouxii and Aspergillus nidulans), which were involved in the conversion from C18:1 to C18:2, a cDNA sequence putatively encoding a Delta12-fatty acid desaturase was isolated from Rhizopus arrhizus using the combination of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. Sequence analysis indicated that it had an open reading frame (ORF) of 1170 bp, coding for 389 amino acid residues of 45 kDa, pI of the deduced protein was 7.01. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cloned cDNA showed high identity to those filamentous fungal Delta12-desaturases mentioned above, including three conserved histidine-rich motifs and two hydrophobic domains. Functional identification was done heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVScl. The result demonstrated that the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited Delta12-fatty acid desaturase activity, suggesting that this gene encoded for a membrane-bound desaturase, Delta12-fatty acid desaturase.
17233721	Characterization of the BLR1 gene encoding a putative blue-light regulator in the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae.	2007	FEMS Microbiol Lett	Bipolaris oryzae is a filamentous ascomycetous fungus that causes brown leaf spot disease in rice. We isolated and characterized BLR1, a gene that encodes a putative blue-light regulator similar to Neurospora crassa white-collar 1 (WC-1). The deduced amino acid sequence of BLR1 showed high degrees of similarity to other fungal blue-light regulator protein. Disruption of the BLR1 gene demonstrated that this gene is essential for conidial development after conidiophore formation and for near-UV radiation-enhanced photolyase gene expression.
8359678	Structural features of a polygalacturonase gene cloned from Aspergillus oryzae KBN616.	1993	FEMS Microbiol Lett	A genomic gene encoding a polygalacturonase from Aspergillus oryzae, used in soy sauce production, was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene comprises 1227 bp coding for 363 amino acids with a putative prepropeptide of 28 amino acids and the open reading frame is disrupted by two short introns of 57 bp and 81 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein showed 63, 63, 63 and 64% homology with those of Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase I, Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase II, Aspergillus tubingensis polygalacturonase II and Cochliobolus carbonum polygalacturonase, respectively. There is, however, little homology among fungal, plant and bacterial polygalacturonases.
16553861	Disruption of SRM1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, affects sensitivity to osmotic and ultraviolet stressors in the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae.	2006	FEMS Microbiol Lett	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play key roles in biological processes including differentiation, growth, proliferation, survival, and stress responses. We isolated and characterized the SRM1 gene, which encodes an MAPK related to yeast High-osmolarity glycerol 1 (Hog1), from the rice leaf pathogen Bipolaris oryzae. The deduced amino sequence of the SRM1 gene showed significant homology with Hog1-type MAPK homologues from other phytopathogenic fungi and contained a TGY motif for phosphorylation. The B. oryzae mutants with disruption of the SRM1 gene (Deltasrm1) showed growth inhibition under hyperosmotic, hydrogen peroxide, and UV exposure conditions. The Deltasrm1 mutants showed moderate resistance to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides. The Deltasrm1 mutations caused a defect in the expression of the gene that encodes antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT2) under UV and hyperosmotic conditions. Furthermore, the transcriptional patterns of the three melanin biosynthesis genes (PKS1, THR1, and SCD1) and of a gene of unknown function, uvi-1, which are specifically induced by near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation, gradually decreased in comparison with the wild-type expression patterns. These results suggest that Srm1 contributes to responses to not only osmostress but also to hydrogen peroxide and UV stress, whereas Srm1 does not appear to regulate directly the expression of genes related to NUV-induced photomorphogenesis.
16842350	Biochemical and molecular characterization of a lipase produced by Rhizopus oryzae.	2006	FEMS Microbiol Lett	A novel strain of Rhizopus oryzae WPG secretes a noninduced lipase (ROLw) in the culture medium; purified ROLw is a protein of 29 kDa, the 45 N-terminal amino acid residues were sequenced, this sequence is very homologous to Rhizopus delemar lipase (RDL), Rhizopus niveus lipase (RNL) and R. oryzae lipase (ROL29) sequences; the cloning and sequencing of the part of the gene encoding the mature ROLw, shows two nucleotides differences with RDL, RNL and ROL29 sequences corresponding to the change of the residues 134 and 200; ROLw does not present the interfacial activation phenomenon when using tripropionin or vinyl propionate as substrates; the lipase activity is maximal at pH 8 and at 37 degrees C, specific activities of 3500 or 900 U mg(-1) were measured at 37 degrees C and at pH 8, using olive oil emulsion or tributyrin as substrates, respectively; ROLw is unable to hydrolyse triacylglycerols in the presence of high concentration of bile salts; it is a serine enzyme as it is inhibited by tetrahydrolipstatin and was stable between pH 5 and pH 8.
16531081	Evidence of RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) in transposase sequences of Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Fungal Genet Biol	A DNA methyl-binding column was used to isolate genomic fragments enriched for DNA-methylation from Aspergillus parasiticus. One of the isolated sequences presented 67% identity at the protein level with the transposase from the transposable element Tan1 of Aspergillus niger var. awamori, and was found to be present in at least 20 copies in the Aspergillus oryzae database. Analysis of four copies showed evidence of C:G to T:A transitions in at least 98.2% of the mutations found over a 1,032-1,180 bp region spanning a large part of the transposase sequence. Using copy specific primers three sequences were amplified from a different strain of A. oryzae and a similar pattern of C:G to T:A transitions was found. These transitions are similar to those observed in RIP, in Neurospora crassa, where cytosine-methylation is believed to be involved. Using methylation-sensitive Southern blotting, no evidence of methylation was found in the transposase sequences in these two A. oryzae strains as well as one A. parasiticus and one Aspergillus flavus strain.
7557464	The fumR gene encoding fumarase in the filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae: cloning, structure and expression.	1995	Gene	The filamentous fungus Rhizopus oryzae (Ro) is known for its ability to overproduce and accumulate high levels of fumaric acid (FA) under stress conditions. In order to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased biosynthesis of FA, the gene (designated fumR) encoding Ro fumarase was cloned and analysed for its structure and expression. Nucleotide (nt) sequence and comparison of the fumR product with fumarases from various sources established that fumR contains nine introns and encodes a deduced product of 494 amino acids (aa), related to class-II fumarases. A fumarase protein of 50 kDa was immuno-detected in crude Ro extracts. Primer extension experiments mapped the 5' end of the fumR RNA 159 nt upstream from the putative translation start codon. Both primer extension and Northern analysis showed the existence of one transcript of fumR. The level of fumR RNA increased in cells producing FA under stress conditions (high carbon and low nitrogen levels in the medium), suggesting that transcriptional regulation of fumR might be involved in the overproduction and accumulation of FA by Ro cells under stress conditions. The possibility that additional mechanisms are responsible for this phenomenon is discussed.
11404008	Phylogeny and origin of 82 zygomycetes from all 54 genera of the Mucorales and Mortierellales based on combined analysis of actin and translation elongation factor EF-1alpha genes.	2001	Gene	True fungi (Eumycota) are heterotrophic eukaryotic microorganisms encompassing ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, chytridiomycetes and zygomycetes. The natural systematics of the latter group, Zygomycota, are very poorly understood due to the lack of distinguishing morphological characters. We have determined sequences for the nuclear-encoded genes actin (act) from 82 zygomycetes representing all 54 currently recognized genera from the two zygomycetous orders Mucorales and Mortierellales. We also determined sequences for translation elongation factor EF-1alpha (tef) from 16 zygomycetes (total of 96,837 bp). Phylogenetic analysis in the context of available sequence data (total 2,062 nucleotide positions per species) revealed that current classification schemes for the mucoralean fungi are highly unnatural at the family and, to a large extent, at the genus level. The data clearly indicate a deep, ancient and distinct dichotomy of the orders Mucorales and Mortierellales, which are recognized only in some zygomycete systems. Yet at the same time the data show that two genera - Umbelopsis and Micromucor - previously placed within the Mortierellales on the basis of their weakly developed columella (a morphological structure of the sporangiophore well-developed within all Mucorales) are in fact members of the Mucorales. Phylogenetic analyses of the encoded amino acid sequences in the context of homologues from eukaryotes and archaebacterial outgroups indicate that the Eumycota studied here are a natural group but provide little or no support for the monophyly of either zygomycetes, ascomycetes or basidiomycetes. The data clearly indicate that a complete revision of zygomycete natural systematics is necessary.
15094197	Cloning, expression and subcellular localization of HN1 and HN1L genes, as well as characterization of their orthologs, defining an evolutionarily conserved gene family.	2004	Gene	The present work reported the cloning and characterization of two novel human genes--HN1 (hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1) and HN1L (HN1-like gene) which are proposed to be involved in embryo development. HN1 is mapped on chromosome 17q25.2, with two transcripts (1.0 and 1.6 kb in length, respectively) due to alternative splicing. HN1 is expressed abundantly in testis and skeletal muscle among 16 human tissues, and it is localized in the nucleus indicated by GFP fusion expression. Western blot confirmed that HN1 encodes a 16.5-kDa protein. HN1L is on chromosome 16p13.3, with three splicing in the length of 2.0, 4.0 and 4.2 kb, respectively. HN1L is expressed in a variety of tissues such as liver, kidney, prostate, testis and uterus at varying levels. HN1L gene encodes a 20-kDa protein, which is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Fourteen of HN1 and sixteen of HN1L homologous genes in different species were determined and analyzed by BLAST searches. Silicon analyses of the 14 orthologous proteins of HN1 and 16 orthologous proteins of HN1L revealed that they share great conservation in vertebrate. Additionally, we identified nine pseudogenes of HN1 (six) and HN1L (three) in the genomes of the human, mouse and rat. Based on sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis, all these homologous genes and pseudogenes were defined as a HN1 gene family.
15556301	The complete nucleotide sequence of wild rice (Oryza nivara) chloroplast genome: first genome wide comparative sequence analysis of wild and cultivated rice.	2004	Gene	We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of wild rice, Oryza nivara and compared it with the corresponding published sequence of relative cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. The genome was 134,494 bp long with a large single-copy region of 80,544 bp, a small single-copy region of 12,346 bp and two inverted repeats of 20,802 bp each. The overall A+T content was 61.0%. The O. nivara chloroplast genome encoded identical functional genes to O. sativa in the same order along the genome. On the other hand, detailed analysis revealed 57 insertion, 61 deletion and 159 base substitution events in the entire chloroplast genome of O. nivara. Among substitutions, transversions were much higher than transitions with the former even more frequent than the latter in the coding region. Most of the insertions/deletions were single-base but a few large length mutations were also detected. The frequency of insertion/deletion events was more in the coding region within inverted repeats. In contrast, a very few substitution events were identified in the coding region. Polymorphism was observed among rice cultivars at loci of large insertion/deletion events. This is the first report describing comparative and genome wide chloroplast analysis between a wild and cultivated crop.
16172529	Two new SINE elements, p-SINE2 and p-SINE3, from rice.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	p-SINE1 was the first plant SINE element identified in the Waxy gene in Oryza sativa, and since then a large number of p-SINE1-family members have been identified from rice species with the AA or non-AA genome. In this paper, we report two new rice SINE elements, designated p-SINE2 and p-SINE3, which form distinct families from that of p-SINE1. Each of the two new elements is significantly homologous to p-SINE1 in their 5'-end regions with that of the polymerase III promoter (A box and B box), but not significantly homologous in the 3'-end regions, although they all have a T-rich tail at the 3' terminus. Despite the three elements sharing minimal homology in their 3'-end regions, the deduced RNA secondary structures of p-SINE1, p-SINE2 and p-SINE3 were found to be similar to one another, such that a stem-loop structure seen in the 3'-end region of each element is well conserved, suggesting that the structure has an important role on the p-SINE retroposition. These findings suggest that the three p-SINE elements originated from a common ancestor. Similar to members of the p-SINE1 family, the members of p-SINE2 or p-SINE3 are almost randomly dispersed in each of the 12 rice chromosomes, but appear to be preferentially inserted into gene-rich regions. The p-SINE2 members were present at respective loci not only in the strains of the species with the AA genome in the O. sativa complex, but also in those of other species with the BB, CC, DD, or EE genome in the O. officinalis complex. The p-SINE3 members were, however, only present in strains of species in the O. sativa complex. These findings suggest that p-SINE2 originated in an ancestral species with the AA, BB, CC, DD and EE genomes, like p-SINE1, whereas p-SINE3 originated in an ancestral strain of the species with the AA genome. The nucleotide sequences of p-SINE1 members are more divergent than those of p-SINE2 or p-SINE3, indicating that p-SINE1 is likely to be older than p-SINE2 and p-SINE3. This suggests that p-SINE2 and p-SINE3 have been derived from p-SINE1.
10925785	New transposable elements identified as insertions in rice transposon Tnr1.	2000	Genes Genet Syst	Tnr1 (235 bp long) is a transposable element in rice. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) done with a primer(s) that hybridizes to terminal inverted repeat sequences (TIRs) of Tnr1 detected new Tnr1 members with one or two insertions in rice genomes. Six identified insertion sequences (Tnr4, Tnr5, Tnr11, Tnr12, Tnr13 and RIRE9) did not have extensive homology to known transposable elements, rather they had structural features characteristic of transposable elements. Tnr4 (1767 bp long) had imperfect 64-bp TIRs and appeared to generate duplication of a 9-bp sequence at the target site. However, the TIR sequences were not homologous to those of known transposable elements, indicative that Tnr4 is a new transposable element. Tnr5 (209 bp long) had imperfect 46-bp TIRs and appeared to generate duplication of sequence TTA like that of some elements of the Tourist family. Tnr11 (811 bp long) had 73-bp TIRs with significant homology to those of Tnr1 and Stowaway and appeared to generate duplication of sequence TA, indicative that Tnr11 is a transposable element of the Tnr1/Stowaway family. Tnr12 (2426 bp long) carried perfect 9-bp TIRs, which began with 5'-CACTA- -3' from both ends and appeared to generate duplication of a 3-bp target sequence, indicative that Tnr12 is a transposable element of the En/Spm family. Tnr13 (347 bp long) had 31-bp TIRs and appeared to generate duplication of an 8-bp target sequence. Two sequences, one the transposon-like element Crackle, had partial homology in the Tnr13 ends. All five insertions appear to be defective elements derived from autonomous ones encoding the transposase gene. All had characteristic tandem repeat sequences which may be recognized by transposase. The sixth insertion sequence, named RIRE9 (3852 bp long), which begins with 5'-TG- -3' and ends with 5'- -CA-3', appeared to generate duplication of a 5-bp target sequence. These and other structural features indicate that this insertion is a solo LTR (long terminal repeat) of a retrotransposon. The transposable elements described above could be identified as insertions into Tnr1, which do not deleteriously affect the growth of rice cells.
12441643	Evolutionary relationships among rice species with AA genome based on SINE insertion analysis.	2002	Genes Genet Syst	Previous studies based on morphological and molecular markers indicated that there are two cultivated and five wild rice species within the Oryza genus with the AA genome. In the cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa, a retroposon named p-SINE1 has been identified. Some of the p-SINE1 members characterized previously showed interspecific insertion polymorphisms in the species with the AA genome. In this study, we identified new p-SINE1 members showing interspecific insertion polymorphisms from representative strains of four wild rice species with the AA genome: O. barthii, O. glumaepatula, O. longistaminata, and O. meridionalis. Some of these members were present only in strains of one species, whereas the others were present in strains of two or more species. The p-SINE1 insertion patterns in the strains of the Asian and African cultivated rice species O. sativa and O. glaberrima were very similar to those of the Asian and African wild rice species O. rufipogon and O. barthii, respectively. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis that O. sativa and O. glaberrima are derived from specific wild rice species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the p-SINE1 insertion patterns showed that the strains of each of the five wild rice species formed a cluster. The strains of O. longistaminata appear to be distantly related to those of O. meridionalis. The strains of these two species appear to be distantly related to those of three other species, O. rufipogon, O. barthii and O. glumaepatula. The latter three species are closely related to one another with O. barthii and O. glumaepatula being most closely related. A phylogenetic tree including a hypothetical ancestor with all loci empty for p-SINE1 insertion showed that the strains of O. longistaminata are related most closely to the hypothetical ancestor. This indicates that O. longistaminata and O. meridionalis diverged early on, whereas the other species diverged relatively recently, and suggests that the Oryza genus with AA genome might have originated in Africa, rather than in Asia.
16172525	Identification and characterization of Australian wild rice strains of Oryza meridionalis and Oryza rufipogon by SINE insertion polymorphism.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	Of the rice species with an AA genome, Oryza meridionalis has been identified in northern Australia as a species of the annual type, among those previously classified as Oryza perennis, Oryza rufipogon or Oryza nivara. This notion has, however, led to some confusion to determine which strains belong to O. meridionalis and how different these strains are from the O. rufipogon strains of the annual type. In this paper, we examined Australian wild rice strains for the presence or absence of p-SINE1 members, which have been used for identification of the strains of species with the AA genome, by PCR using primers that hybridize to the sequences flanking each p-SINE1 member. The rice strains examined include perennial and annual strains, which have previously been described as O. rufipogon. We found that all the annual strains and other strains, whose types have not been determined, have p-SINE1 members that are specifically present at the corresponding loci in the standard strains of O. meridionalis, but do not have those which are specifically present at the corresponding loci in the strains of the other species with the AA genome. The perennial strains, however, have p-SINE1 members that are specifically present at the corresponding loci in the standard O. rufipogon strains of either the annual or the perennial type, but do not have those which are specifically present at the corresponding loci in the strains of the other species with the AA genome, including O. meridionalis. These findings support the previous notion that O. meridionalis consists of the annual strains and is a distinct species from O. rufipogon. The p-SINE1 members used in this study appear to be very useful for classification of any wild rice strains of the AA-genome species, even when one has limited knowledge of morphology, taxonomy, physiology, and biochemistry of rice strains.
16547098	Selection under domestication: evidence for a sweep in the rice waxy genomic region.	2006	Genetics	Rice (Oryza sativa) was cultivated by Asian Neolithic farmers >11,000 years ago, and different cultures have selected for divergent starch qualities in the rice grain during and after the domestication process. An intron 1 splice donor site mutation of the Waxy gene is responsible for the absence of amylose in glutinous rice varieties. This mutation appears to have also played an important role in the origin of low amylose, nonglutinous temperate japonica rice varieties, which form a primary component of Northeast Asian cuisines. Waxy DNA sequence analyses indicate that the splice donor mutation is prevalent in temperate japonica rice varieties, but rare or absent in tropical japonica, indica, aus, and aromatic varieties. Sequence analysis across a 500-kb genomic region centered on Waxy reveals patterns consistent with a selective sweep in the temperate japonicas associated with the mutation. The size of the selective sweep (>250 kb) indicates very strong selection in this region, with an inferred selection coefficient that is higher than similar estimates from maize domestication genes or wild species. These findings demonstrate that selection pressures associated with crop domestication regimes can exceed by one to two orders of magnitude those observed for genes under even strong selection in natural systems.
16430983	Cladal relatedness among Aspergillus oryzae isolates and Aspergillus flavus S and L morphotype isolates.	2006	Int J Food Microbiol	Aspergillus flavus is the main etiological agent for aflatoxin contamination of crops. Its close relative, A. oryzae, does not produce aflatoxins and has been widely used to produce fermented foods. We compared the phylogeny of A. oryzae isolates and L- and S-type sclerotial isolates of A. flavus using single nucleotide polymorphisms in the omtA gene in the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster and deletions in and distal to the norB-cypA intergenic region as phylogenetic signals. Aflatoxin-producing ability and sclerotial size also were weighted in the analysis. Like A. flavus, the A. oryzae isolates form a polyphyletic assemblage. A. oryzae isolates in one clade strikingly resemble an A. flavus subgroup of atoxigenic L-type isolates. All toxigenic S-type isolates closely resemble another subgroup of atoxigenic L-type isolates. Because atoxigenic S-type isolates are extremely rare, we hypothesize that loss of aflatoxin production in S-type isolates may occur concomitantly with a change to L-type sclerotia. All toxigenic L-type isolates, unlike A. oryzae, have a 1.0 kb deletion in the norB-cypA region. Although A. oryzae isolates, like S-type, have a 1.5 kb deletion in the norB-cypA region, none were cladally related to S-type A. flavus isolates. Our results show that A. flavus populations are genetically diverse. A. oryzae isolates may descend from certain atoxigenic L-type A. flavus isolates.
16310740	Cloning and expression of NAD+-dependent L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase gene (ladA) of Aspergillus oryzae.	2005	J Biosci Bioeng	A gene of Aspergillus oryzae, ladA, which encodes L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.12), and its cDNA were cloned in Escherichia coli. The gene consisted of a 1209-bp coding region, interrupted by a 59-bp intron, which encoded a 382-amino-acid polypeptide (40,812 Da). The protein showed 67% identity to a well-studied L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (Lad1) of Hypocrea jecorina. The cell-free extract of E. coli, which expressed ladA cDNA, showed L-arabinitol dehydrogenase activity with NAD+. It was also reactive for ribitol and xylitol.
17189178	Identification of genes from Aspergillus oryzae that are preferentially expressed in membrane-surface liquid culture.	2006	J Biosci Bioeng	We identified 22 genes from Aspergillus oryzae that are preferentially expressed in membrane-surface liquid culture (MSLC), among which Ser/Thr protein kinase (aopk1) and phosphatase (aoppt) genes were cloned. We also revealed that aopk1 encodes a protein with an N-terminal sequence 150 amino acid residues longer than that predicted from the registered sequence in GenBank.
16233536	Xylosidases associated with the cell surface of Penicillium herquei IFO 4674.	2003	J Biosci Bioeng	Penicillium herquei IFO 4674 is a filamentous fungus that produces a large amount of hydrolases for fibrous polysaccharides. We purified two beta-xylosidases, S1 and S2. The molecular masses of S1 and S2 determined by MALDI-TOF-MS were 103,700 and 37,460 Da. The optimum pHs of S1 and S2 were 4.0 and 6.5, respectively. By several kinds of alcohols, especially glycerol, S1 was activated while S2 was unaffected or inhibited. S1 had a transxylosylation activity, while S2 did not. The s2 gene encoding xylosidase S2 was cloned by PCR with primers designed on the basis of partial amino acid sequences of S2. The s2 consisted of 1005 by encoding 335 amino acids (37,433 Da) and had no secretion signal sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high identity to that of Bacteroides ovatus xylosidase/arabinosidase (56%), which is a member of the family 43 glycoside hydrolase.
16233653	Cloning and expression of a NAD+-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase gene (xdhA) of Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	J Biosci Bioeng	XdhA, which encodes a xylitol dehydrogenase gene, was cloned from Aspergillus oryzae genomic DNA. It consists of 1214 bp structural region, which is interrupted by two introns, and encodes 358-amino-acid protein (38,197 Da). It is similar to the known NAD(+)-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9). The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI using a T7 promoter. The cell-free extract of the transformant showed a 36.5 kDa band upon SDS-PAGE and NAD(+)-dependent xylitol dehydrogenase activity.
16129506	An Aspergillus oryzae acetyl xylan esterase: molecular cloning and characteristics of recombinant enzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris.	2006	J Biotechnol	We screened 20,000 clones of an expressed sequence tag (EST) library from Aspergillus oryzae (http://www.nrib.go.jp/ken/EST/db/index.html) and obtained one cDNA clone encoding a protein with similarity to fungal acetyl xylan esterase. We also cloned the corresponding gene, designated as Aoaxe, from the genomic DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of a putative signal peptide of 31-amino acids and a mature protein of 276-amino acids. We engineered Aoaxe for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. Recombinant AoAXE (rAoAXE) was secreted by the aid of fused alpha-factor secretion signal peptide and accumulated as an active enzyme in the culture medium to a final level of 190 mg/l after 5 days. Purified rAoAXEA before and after treatment with endoglycosidase H migrated by SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 31 and 30 kDa, respectively. Purified rAoAXE displayed the greatest hydrolytic activity toward alpha-naphthylacetate (C2), lower activity toward alpha-naphthylpropionate (C3) and no detectable activity toward acyl-chain substrates containing four or more carbon atoms. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the release of acetic acid from birchwood xylan. No activity was detectable using methyl esters of ferulic, caffeic or sinapic acids. rAoAXE was thermolabile in comparison to other AXEs from Aspergillus.
16455881	Molecular identification of zygomycetes from culture and experimentally infected tissues.	2006	J Clin Microbiol	Mucormycosis is an emerging infection associated with a high mortality rate. Identification of the causative agents remains difficult and time-consuming by standard mycological procedures. In this study, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing was validated as a reliable technique for identification of Zygomycetes to the species level. Furthermore, species identification directly from infected tissues was evaluated in experimentally infected mice. Fifty-four Zygomycetes strains belonging to 16 species, including the most common pathogenic species of Rhizopus spp., Absidia spp., Mucor spp., and Rhizomucor spp., were used to assess intra- and interspecies variability. Ribosomal DNA including the complete ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was amplified with fungal universal primers, sequenced, and compared. Overall, for a given species, sequence similarities between isolates were >98%. In contrast, ITS sequences were very different between species, allowing an accurate identification of Zygomycetes to the species level in most cases. Six species (Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizomucor pusillus, Mucor circinelloides, and Mucor indicus) were also used to induce disseminated mucormycosis in mice and to demonstrate that DNA extraction, amplification of fungal DNA, sequencing, and molecular identification were possible directly from frozen tissues.
17086451	The frequency of eubacterium-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfers shows significant cross-taxa variation within amoebozoa.	2006	J Mol Evol	Single-celled bacterivorous eukaryotes offer excellent test cases for evaluation of the frequency of prey-to-predator lateral gene transfer (LGT). Here we use analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) data sets to quantify the extent of LGT from eubacteria to two amoebae, Acanthamoeba castellanii and Hartmannella vermiformis. Stringent screening for LGT proceeded in several steps intended to enrich for authentic events while at the same time minimizing the incidence of false positives due to factors such as limitations in database coverage and ancient paralogy. The results were compared with data obtained when the same methodology was applied to EST libraries from a number of other eukaryotic taxa. Significant differences in the extent of apparent eubacterium-to-eukaryote LGT were found between taxa. Our results indicate that there may be substantial inter-taxon variation in the number of LGT events that become fixed even between amoebozoan species that have similar feeding modalities.
1910873	Organization of DNA sequences highly repeated in tandem in rice genomes.	1991	Jpn J Genet	Digestion of the total genomic DNA from rice Oryza sativa L. cv. C5924 with EcoRI generated an intense band of a DNA fragment of about 0.36 kb long. The DNA fragment cloned into pUC19 was used to hybridize with the total rice genomic DNA partially digested with EcoRI. A ladder of bands of DNA fragments with multiplied length of 0.36 kb was observed, demonstrating that this sequence occurs in tandem in the genome. The copy number of the sequence estimated by dot blot hybridization analysis was 2000-3000 copies per haploid genome from callus or seedling of C5924. This sequence was present in other O. sativa cultivars, such as Sasanishiki in 700-900 copies, Koshihikari in 3400-4300, and Nipponbare in 4600-6000 copies. Another rice species, O. glaberrima, also had this sequence in 540-680 copies, but four lines of foxtail millet had none. The DNA fragments containing the repeated sequences in Nipponbare were then cloned into lambda EMBL3, and sequences of nine units consecutively repeated and an AT-rich sequence connected with them in a phage clone could be determined. Each repeating unit showed sequence divergency mostly by substitution of bases in a range from 3% to 7%, when compared with a 355-bp consensus sequence. Analyses of the substituted bases indicate that these are due to spontaneous mutations which occurred at random, after reiteration of a unit sequence by unequal crossing over events. Gene conversion within the repeated sequences might have further diversified their sequences.
16385126	Comparison of the aflR gene sequences of strains in Aspergillus section Flavi.	2006	Microbiology	Aflatoxins are polyketide-derived secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius and a few other species. The toxic effects of aflatoxins have adverse consequences for human health and agricultural economics. The aflR gene, a regulatory gene for aflatoxin biosynthesis, encodes a protein containing a zinc-finger DNA-binding motif. Although Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus sojae, which are used in fermented foods and in ingredient manufacture, have no record of producing aflatoxin, they have been shown to possess an aflR gene. This study examined 34 strains of Aspergillus section Flavi. The aflR gene of 23 of these strains was successfully amplified and sequenced. No aflR PCR products were found in five A. sojae strains or six strains of A. oryzae. These PCR results suggested that the aflR gene is absent or significantly different in some A. sojae and A. oryzae strains. The sequenced aflR genes from the 23 positive strains had greater than 96.6 % similarity, which was particularly conserved in the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. The aflR gene of A. sojae has two obvious characteristics: an extra CTCATG sequence fragment and a C to T transition that causes premature termination of AFLR protein synthesis. Differences between A. parasiticus/A. sojae and A. flavus/A. oryzae aflR genes were also identified. Some strains of A. flavus as well as A. flavus var. viridis, A. oryzae var. viridis and A. oryzae var. effuses have an A. oryzae-type aflR gene. For all strains with the A. oryzae-type aflR gene, there was no evidence of aflatoxin production. It is suggested that for safety reasons, the aflR gene could be examined to assess possible aflatoxin production by Aspergillus section Flavi strains.
10028288	Evolutionary dynamics of Ty1-copia group retrotransposons in grass shown by reverse transcriptase domain analysis.	1999	Mol Biol Evol	The evolutionary dynamics of Ty1-copia group retrotransposons in grass were examined by reverse transcriptase (RT) domain analysis. Twenty-three rice RT sequences were newly determined for this report. Phylogenetic analysis of 177 RT sequences, mostly derived from wheat, rice, and, maize, showed four distinct families, which were designated G1, G2, G3, and G4. Three of these families have elements obtained from distantly related species, indicative of origins prior to the radiation of grass species. Results of Southern hybridization and detailed comparisons between the wheat and rice sequences indicated that each of the families had undergone a distinct pattern of evolution. Multiple families appear to have evolved in parallel in a host species. Analyses of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions suggested that there is a low percentage of elements carrying functional RT domains in the G4 family, indicating that the production of new G4 elements has been controlled by a small number of elements carrying functional RT domains.
12519908	Polyphyletic origin of cultivated rice: based on the interspersion pattern of SINEs.	2003	Mol Biol Evol	The wild rice species Oryza rufipogon with wide intraspecific variation is thought to be the progenitor of the cultivated rice species Oryza sativa with two ecotypes, japonica and indica. To determine the origin of cultivated rice, subfamily members of the rice retroposon p-SINE1, which show insertion polymorphism in the O. sativa -O. rufipogon population, were identified and used to "bar code" each of 101 cultivated and wild rice strains based on the presence or absence of the p-SINE1 members at the respective loci. A phylogenetic tree constructed based on the bar codes given to the rice strains showed that O. sativa strains were classified into two groups corresponding to japonica and indica, whereas O. rufipogon strains were in four groups, in which annual O. rufipogon strains formed a single group, differing from the perennial O. rufipogon strains of the other three groups. Japonica strains were closely related to the O. rufipogon perennial strains of one group, and the indica strains were closely related to the O. rufipogon annual strains, indicating that O. sativa has been derived polyphyletically from O. rufipogon. The subfamily members of p-SINE1 constitute a powerful tool for studying the classification and relationship of rice strains, even when one has limited knowledge of morphology, taxonomy, physiology, and biochemistry of rice strains.
16382184	Secretion of pro- and mature Rhizopus arrhizus lipases by Pichia pastoris and properties of the proteins.	2006	Mol Biotechnol	The lipases of Rhizopus spp. share a high 1,3-regiospecificity toward triacylglycerols, which makes them important enzymes in lipid modification. In the present study, the extracellularly active production of recombinant Rhizopus arrhizuslipase was carried out with genes encoding the mature region (mRAL) and the mRAL having the prosequence (ProRAL) in Pichia pastoris. Two transformed P. pastoris clones containing the multicopy of mRAL and ProRAL genes were separately selected for the production of recombinant enzymes. In a fed-batch cultivation, where methanol feeding was controlled by an on-line methanol analyzer, the supernatant contained 91 mg/L recombinant pro-form lipase (rProRAL) and 80 mg/L recombinant mature lipase (rRAL) after 92 h of cultivation. rProRAL and rRAL were purified by ultrafiltration, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography, and Butyl-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography. Molecular weights of rProRAL and rRAL are 32 kDa and 29 kDa, respectively. The amino-terminal analysis showed that the 32-kDa protein was mRAL attached with 28 amino acids of the carboxy-terminal part of the prosequence (rPro28RAL). The specific lipase activities of mRAL attached with 28 amino acids of the carboxy-terminal part of the prosequence (rPro28RAL) and rRAL were 1543 U/mg and 2437 U/mg. The rPro28RAL was more stable than rRAL at pH 4.0-7.0, whereas rRAL was more stable at pH 7.0-10.0. The rPro28RAL had the highest lipase activity toward tributyrin (C4), whereas rRAL had the highest lipase activity toward tricaprylin (C8).
2770692	The complete sequence of the rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast genome: intermolecular recombination between distinct tRNA genes accounts for a major plastid DNA inversion during the evolution of the cereals.	1989	Mol Gen Genet	The entire chloroplast genome of the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) has been sequenced and comprises 134525 bp. Predicted genes have been identified along with open reading frames (ORFs) conserved between rice and the previously sequenced chloroplast genomes, a dicot, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and a liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha). The same complement of 30 tRNA and 4 rRNA genes has been conserved between rice and tobacco. Most ORFs extensively conserved between N. tabacum and M. polymorpha are also conserved intact in rice. However, several such ORFs are entirely absent in rice, or present only in severely truncated form. Structural changes are also apparent in the genome relative to tobacco. The inverted repeats, characteristic of chloroplast genome structure, have expanded outward to include several genes present only once per genome in tobacco and liverwort and the large single copy region has undergone a series of inversions which predate the divergence of the cereals. A chimeric tRNA pseudogene overlaps an apparent endpoint of the largest inversion, and a model invoking illegitimate recombination between tRNA genes is proposed which accounts simultaneously for the origin of this pseudogene, the large inversion and the creation of repeated sequences near the inversion endpoints.
7808394	Involvement of transposition in dispersion of tandem repeat sequences (TrsA) in rice genomes.	1994	Mol Gen Genet	We describe a method to identify and characterize DNA fragments containing the junction of AA genome-specific tandem repeat sequences (here called TrsA) with adjacent chromosomal sequences of rice by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of primers that hybridize with TrsAs and a flanking non-TrsA sequence. With this method, we obtained results suggesting that TrsA sequences present at two loci (here called trsA1 and trsA2) are flanked by direct repeats of chromosomal sequences of 172 bp and about 440 bp in length, respectively. These results support the idea that the TrsA sequences have been inserted into each locus by transposition, resulting in duplication of the chromosomal sequence used as target. We also describe a method to identify and characterize TrsA sequences repeated in only a few copies in the rice genome by PCR, using a pair of primers that hybridize with two different portions in the TrsA sequence, and demonstrate that TrsA sequences are present not only in rice strains with the AA genome, but also in those with non-AA genomes. The TrsA sequences were present at the trsA1 locus in all the rice strains examined, indicating that TrsA was inserted and amplified at the locus before the divergence of the various species of rice in the Oryza genus. TrsA sequences were present at the trsA2 locus, however, only in an O. sativa IR36 strain, indicating that TrsA was inserted and amplified at this locus during divergence of rice strains with the AA genome.
8628213	Identification of Tnr3, a suppressor-mutator/enhancer-like transposable element from rice.	1996	Mol Gen Genet	We isolated members of the retroposon family p-SINE1 in rice and found that one member contained an insertion.Aa 3-bp sequence at the insertion site within p-SINE1 appeared duplicated. The insertion sequence, 1539 bp in length, carried imperfect inverted repeats of about 13 bp at its termini which begin with 5'-CACTA---3'; these repeats are similar to those found in members of the En/Spm transposable element family. These results indicate that the insertion sequence is a transposable element belonging to the En/Spm family and is thus named Tnr3 (transposable element in rice no. 3). In fact, Tnr carried long subterminal regions containing direct and inverted repeats of short DNA sequences of 15 bp, another characteristic of the En/Spm family. The subterminal repeat sequences in Tnr3 are, however, of two kinds, although they share homology with each other. Tnr3 and its relatives were present in multiple copies in rice. considering the length of Tnr3, it cannot represent an autonomous type element, but is a non-autonomous element probably derived by deletion from an autonomous transposon.
10071212	Non-LTR retrotransposons (LINEs) as ubiquitous components of plant genomes.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	During the course of work aimed at isolating a rice gene from Oryza australiensis by PCR, the oligonucleotide primers used were found to generate a fragment that showed sequence homology to the endonuclease (EN) region of the maize non-LTR retrotransposon (LINE) Cin4. We carried out further PCRs using oligonucleotide primers that hybridized to these sequences, and found that they amplified several fragments, each with homology to the EN regions, from Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare as well as O. australiensis. We mapped the approximate locations of two rice LINE homologues by screening clones in a YAC library made from a rice (O. sativa) genome, and found that each homologue was present in a low copy number apparently at nonspecific regions on rice chromosomes. We then carried out PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers which hybridized to the rice LINE homologues and Cin4 to ascertain whether LINE homologues are present in a variety of members of the plant kingdom, including angiosperms, gymnosperms, bracken, horsetail and liverwort. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that 53 clones obtained from 27 out of 33 plant species contained LINE homologues. In addition to these homologues, we identified four homologues with EN regions in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome by a computer search of databases. The nucleotide sequences of almost all the LINE homologues were greatly diverged, but the derived amino acid sequences were well conserved, and all contained glutamic acid and tyrosine residues at almost the same relative positions as in the the active site regions of AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic)-endonucleases. The EN regions in the LINE homologues from closely related plant species show a closer phylogenetic relationship, indicating that sequence divergence during vertical transmission has been a major influence upon the evolution of plant LINEs.
11212914	Variation in sequence and RNA editing within core domains of mitochondrial group II introns among plants.	2001	Mol Gen Genet	The 3' regions of several group II introns within the mitochondrial genes nad1 and nad7 show unexpected sequence divergence among flowering plants, and the core domains 5 and 6 are predicted to have weaker helical structure than those in self-splicing group II introns. To assess whether RNA editing improves helical stability by the conversion of A-C mispairs to A-U pairs, we sequenced RT-PCR amplification products derived from excised intron RNAs or partially spliced precursors. Only in some cases was editing observed to strengthen the predicted helices. Moreover, the editing status within nad1 intron 1 and nad7 intron 4 was seen to differ among plant species, so that homologous intron sequences shared lower similarity at the RNA level than at the DNA level. Plant-specific variation was also seen in the length of the linker joining domains 5 and 6 of nad7 intron 3; it ranged from 4 nt in wheat to 11 nt in soybean, in contrast to the 2-4 nt length typical of classical group II introns. However, this intron is excised as a lariat structure with a domain 6 branchpoint adenosine. Our observations suggest that the core structures and sequences of these plant mitochondrial introns are subject to less stringent evolutionary constraints than conventional group II introns.
16470383	Enhanced gene targeting frequency in ku70 and ku80 disruption mutants of Aspergillus sojae and Aspergillus oryzae.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	In the koji molds Aspergillus sojae and Aspergillus oryzae, exogenous DNA is integrated in the genome, in most cases irrespective of the sequence homology, suggesting that DNA integration occurs predominantly through a nonhomologous end joining pathway where two ku genes, namely, ku70 and ku80, play a key role. To determine the effect of ku gene disruption on the gene targeting frequency, we constructed ku70-, ku80-, and ku70-ku80-disrupted strains of A. sojae and A. oryzae. The gene targeting frequency of the tannase gene in ku70 and ku80 strains of both Aspergillus species was markedly enhanced as compared with that of the parental strains. The gene targeting frequency of the aflR and ku80 genes was also enhanced in an A. sojae ku70 background. Therefore, the koji mold strains with ku-disrupted genes will be excellent tools as hosts for efficient gene targeting.
12471441	The complete sequence of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) mitochondrial genome: frequent DNA sequence acquisition and loss during the evolution of flowering plants.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	The entire mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot plant, has been sequenced. It was found to comprise 490,520 bp, with an average G+C content of 43.8%. Three rRNA genes, 17 tRNA genes and five pseudo tRNA sequences were identified. In addition, eleven ribosomal protein genes and two pseudo ribosomal protein genes were found, which are homologous to 13 of the 16 genes for ribosomal proteins in the mitochondrial genome of the liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha). A greater degree of variation in terms of presence/absence and integrity of genes was observed among the ribosomal protein genes and tRNA genes of rice, Arabidopsis and sugar beet. Transcription and post-transcriptional modification (RNA editing) in the rice mitochondrial sequence were also examined. In all, 491 Cs in the genomic DNA were converted to Ts in cDNA. The frequency of RNA editing differed markedly depending upon the ORF considered. Sequences derived from plastid and nuclear genomes make up 6.3% and 13.4% of the mitochondrial genome, respectively. The degree of conservation of plastid sequences in the mitochondrial genome ranged from 61% to 100%, suggesting that sequence migration has occurred very frequently. Three plastid DNA fragments that were incorporated into the mitochondrial genome were subsequently transferred to the nuclear genome. Nineteen fragments that were similar to transposon or retrotransposon sequences, but different from those found in the mitochondrial genomes of dicots, were identified. The results indicate frequent and independent DNA sequence flow to and from the mitochondrial genome during the evolution of flowering plants, and this may account for the range of genetic variation observed between the mitochondrial genomes of higher plants.
16463049	Diversity of centromeric repeats in two closely related wild rice species, Oryza officinalis and Oryza rhizomatis.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Oryza officinalis (CC, 2n = 24) and Oryza rhizomatis (CC, 2n = 24) belong to the Oryza genus, which contains more than 20 identified wild rice species. Although much has been known about the molecular composition and organization of centromeres in Oryza sativa, relatively little is known of its wild relatives. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a 126-bp centromeric satellite (CentO-C) from three bacterial artificial chromosomes of O. officinalis. In addition to CentO-C, low abundance of CentO satellites is also present in O. officinalis. In order to determine the chromosomal locations and distributions of CentO-C (126-bp), CentO (155 bp) and TrsC (366 bp) satellite within O. officinalis, fluorescence in situ hybridization examination was done on pachytene or metaphase I chromosomes. We found that only ten centromeres (excluding centromere 7 and 2) contain CentO-C arrays in O. officinalis, while centromere 7 comprises CentO satellites, and centromere 2 is devoid of any detectable satellites. For TrsC satellites, it was detected at multiple subtelomeric regions in O. officinalis, however, in O. rhizomatis, TrsC sequences were detected both in the four centromeric regions (CEN 3, 4, 10, 11) and the multiple subtelomeric regions. Therefore, these data reveal the evolutionary diversification pattern of centromere DNA within/or between close related species, and could provide an insight into the dynamic evolutionary processes of rice centromere.
2785629	Three alpha-amylase genes of Aspergillus oryzae exhibit identical intron-exon organization.	1989	Mol Microbiol	We have cloned three genes (amy1, amy2 and amy3) encoding alpha-amylase in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The established overall sequences have a very high degree of homology, showing divergences mainly in the 3'-untranslated regions. The positions and the sequences of the eight introns were found to be absolutely identical in the three genes. The sequence analysis of the 5'-regions revealed presumptive TATA, CAAT and GC boxes. Primer extension analysis was performed to determine the transcription start. We were able to detect mRNAs from amy1 and amy3 but not from amy2 with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes complementary to the 3'-noncoding regions.
16781873	Manganese superoxide dismutase based phylogeny of pathogenic fungi.	2006	Mol Phylogenet Evol	Superoxide dismutases (SODs), which provide protection against oxidative stress, exhibit an essential role for fungal cell survival, especially during host invasion. Here, 20 partial SOD sequences from 19 pathogenic fungi were determined and aligned with 43 homologous fungal sequences from databases. All sequences encoded tetrameric manganese (Mn)-containing SODs showing predicted cytosolic or mitochondrial subcellular localization. Numerous fungi possessed both cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSODs in addition to the mainly cytosolic copper/zinc isozyme. Moreover, MnSOD sequence variability was higher than SSU rRNA and similar to ITS rRNA, suggesting MnSOD could be used to identify closely related fungal species. MnSOD- and SSU rRNA-based phylogenetic trees were constructed and compared. Despite a more complex topology of the MnSOD tree, due to several gene duplication events, all the classic fungal classes and orders were recovered. A salient point was the existence of two paralogous cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSODs in some Ascomycota. A hypothetical evolutionary scenario with an early gene duplication of the "mitochondrial" gene is proposed.
16941905	Nonhost resistance of barley is successfully manifested against Magnaporthe grisea and a closely related Pennisetum-infecting lineage but is overcome by Magnaporthe oryzae.	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Magnaporthe oryzae is a major pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) but is also able to infect other grasses, including barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Here, we report a study using Magnaporthe isolates collected from other host plant species to evaluate their capacity to infect barley. A nonhost type of resistance was detected in barley against isolates derived from genera Pennisetum (fontaingrass) or Digitaria (crabgrass), but no resistance occurred in response to isolates from rice, genus Eleusine (goosegrass), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), or maize (Zea mays L.), respectively. Restriction of pathogen growth in the nonhost interaction was investigated microscopically and compared with compatible interactions. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify fungal biomass in both types of interaction. The phylogenetic relationship among the Magnaporthe isolates used in this study was investigated by inferring gene trees for fragments of three genes, actin, calmodulin, and beta-tubulin. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we could distinguish different species that were strictly correlated with the ability of the isolates to infect barley. We demonstrated that investigating specific host interaction phenotypes for a range of pathogen isolates can accurately highlight genetic diversity within a pathogen population.
17015001	Two families of extracellular phospholipase C genes are present in aspergilli.	2006	Mycol Res	Fungi secrete extracellular enzymes to enable them to harvest nutrients from the environment. In the case of pathogenic fungi these enzymes can also be pathogenesis factors. Here we report the identification in fungi of a complex family of extracellular phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes, homologous to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PLCH_PSEAE. Database searches and phylogenetic analysis showed that the PLCs clustered into two groups with different evolutionary histories. One group, subdivided into PLC-A, -B, -C and -D, was found only in aspergilli and Neosartorya fischeri. Each species only ever showed three of the four PLCs except N. fischeri which had all four PLCs plus duplicate PLC-A, -B and -C genes. Modelling studies indicated that these PLCs had mechanistic similarities to phosphoesterases and aryl sulphatases, but that they probably did not differ in substrate specificity. The second group, PLC-E, was seen in a wider range of fungi including some species of aspergilli and was always found in a head-to-head arrangement with a copper oxidase, similar to the laccases. The PLC genes appear to have arisen from separate gene transfer events from bacteria or lower eukaryotes. Thus, aspergilli have acquired PLCs twice in the course of evolution.
16378718	Phylogenetic investigations of Sordariaceae based on multiple gene sequences and morphology.	2006	Mycol Res	The family Sordariaceae incorporates a number of fungi that are excellent model organisms for various biological, biochemical, ecological, genetic and evolutionary studies. To determine the evolutionary relationships within this group and their respective phylogenetic placements, multiple-gene sequences (partial nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA, nuclear ITS ribosomal DNA and partial nuclear beta-tubulin) were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Analyses of different gene datasets were performed individually and then combined to generate phylogenies. We report that Sordariaceae, with the exclusion Apodus and Diplogelasinospora, is a monophyletic group. Apodus and Diplogelasinospora are related to Lasiosphaeriaceae. Multiple gene analyses suggest that the spore sheath is not a phylogenetically significant character to segregate Asordaria from Sordaria. Smooth-spored Sordaria species (including so-called Asordaria species) constitute a natural group. Asordaria is therefore congeneric with Sordaria. Anixiella species nested among Gelasinospora species, providing further evidence that non-ostiolate ascomata have evolved from ostiolate ascomata on several independent occasions. This study agrees with previous studies that show heterothallic Neurospora species to be monophyletic, but that homothallic ones may have a multiple origins. Although Gelasinospora and Neurospora are closely related and not resolved as monophyletic groups, there is insufficient evidence to place currently accepted Gelasinospora and Neurospora species into the same genus.
12520302	An active DNA transposon family in rice.	2003	Nature	The publication of draft sequences for the two subspecies of Oryza sativa (rice), japonica (cv. Nipponbare) and indica (cv. 93-11), provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of transposable elements in this important crop plant. Here we report the use of these sequences in a computational approach to identify the first active DNA transposons from rice and the first active miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) from any organism. A sequence classified as a Tourist-like MITE of 430 base pairs, called miniature Ping (mPing), was present in about 70 copies in Nipponbare and in about 14 copies in 93-11. These mPing elements, which are all nearly identical, transpose actively in an indica cell-culture line. Database searches identified a family of related transposase-encoding elements (called Pong), which also transpose actively in the same cells. Virtually all new insertions of mPing and Pong elements were into low-copy regions of the rice genome. Since the domestication of rice mPing MITEs have been amplified preferentially in cultivars adapted to environmental extremes-a situation that is reminiscent of the genomic shock theory for transposon activation.
6093039	Cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene of rice has an insertion sequence within the intron.	1984	Nucleic Acids Res	We have isolated and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene from rice (Oryza sativa L. var Labelle). The overall structural organization of this gene is very similar to that of the maize gene. This gene contains an intron in a position identical to the intron in the maize gene. However, the intron in the rice gene is longer than that of the maize gene largely due to a 461 bp insertion sequence, which has inverted repeats at its termini and is flanked by direct repeats, characteristic of transposable elements. Apart from this insertion sequence, the remainder of the intron sequence is strikingly homologous to that of maize (98.6% homology), suggesting a possible functional or structural role. The coding regions of the two genes exhibit 99.5% nucleotide sequence homology and their deduced amino acid sequences are identical. Similarly, the 3'-noncoding regions, except for several small insertions and deletions, show complete sequence homology. On the contrary, no sequence homology is detected in the 5'-noncoding regions.
1708498	Fine structural features of the chloroplast genome: comparison of the sequenced chloroplast genomes.	1991	Nucleic Acids Res	The entire nucleotide sequences of the rice, tobacco and liverwort chloroplast genomes have been determined. We compared all the chloroplast genes, open reading frames and spacer regions in the plastid genomes of these three species in order to elucidate general structural features of the chloroplast genome. Analyses of homology, GC content and codon usage of the genes enabled us to classify them into two groups: photosynthesis genes and genetic system genes. Based on comparisons of homology, GC content and codon usage, unidentified ORFs can also be assigned to each of these groups such that it is possible to speculate about the functions of products which may be produced by these ORFs. The spacer regions and intron sequences were compared and found to have no obvious homology between rice and liverwort or between tobacco and liverwort.
16808934	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice.	2006	Phytochemistry	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant hormones involved in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes. To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice. It was mainly expressed in roots and leaf sheaths with levels of expression directly dependent on the dose of BL. In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue. Furthermore, its expression was enhanced by co-treatment with BL and low concentrations of IAA. These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin. The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment. OsBLE3 transcript levels were greatly reduced in brd1 plants, a BL deficient mutant, compared to the wild type control. In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR-insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector. Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants. Internode cell length of the OsBLE3 antisense transgenic lines was about 70% of that in the vacant vector transformed control lines. These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA.
15279994	The class III peroxidase multigenic family in rice and its evolution in land plants.	2004	Phytochemistry	Plant peroxidases (class III peroxidases, E.C. 1.11.1.7) are secreted glycoproteins known to be involved in the mechanism of cell elongation, in cell wall construction and differentiation, and in the defense against pathogens. They usually form large multigenic families in angiosperms. The recent completion of rice (Oryza sativa japonica c.v. Nipponbare) genome sequencing allowed drawing up the full inventory of the genes encoding class III peroxidases in this plant. We found 138 peroxidase genes distributed among the 12 rice chromosomes. In contrast to several other gene families studied so far, peroxidase genes are twice as numerous in rice as in Arabidopsis. This large number of genes results from various duplication events that were tentatively traced back using a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of conserved amino acid sequences. We also searched for peroxidase encoding genes in the major phyla of plant kingdom. In addition to gymnosperms and angiosperms, sequences were found in liverworts, mosses and ferns, but not in unicellular green algae. Two rice and one Arabidopsis peroxidase genes appeared to be rather close to the only known sequence from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The possible relationship of these peroxidases with the putative ancestor of peroxidase genes is discussed, as well as the connection between the development of the class III peroxidase multigenic family and the emergence of the first land plants.
7545979	Nucleotide sequence of a 28-kbp portion of rice mitochondrial DNA: the existence of many sequences that correspond to parts of mitochondrial genes in intergenic regions.	1994	Plant Cell Physiol	The nucleotide sequence of a 27,588-bp region of rice mitochondrial DNA was determined. This sequence contains putative genes that encode initiator methionine tRNA (trnfM), subunits III (nad3) and IV (nad4) of the NADH dehydrogenase complex, and ribosomal proteins S3 (rps3), S12 (rps12) and L16 (rpl16). An open reading frame that contains sequences homologous to parts of rps2 and atpA is also present. In addition to these regions, there are many short sequences with homology to fragments of mitochondrial DNAs from rice or other plants. These sequences may be remnants of multiple rearrangements of the genome and their presence seems to explain, in part, the large sizes of the mitochondrial genomes of higher plants.
8528607	Structure of a gene subunit 9 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad9) in rice mitochondria and RNA editing of its transcript.	1995	Plant Cell Physiol	We identified a gene for subunit 9 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad9) in rice mitochondrial DNA. Southern and Northern hybridizations demonstrated that rice nad9 is present in a unique region in mtDNA and is transcribed at a high level. The transcript of rice nad9 is edited at twelve positions.
15604740	Identification of a novel plant MAR DNA binding protein localized on chromosomal surfaces.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	We identified a novel nucleoplasm localized protein in Arabidopsis called AT-hook motif nuclear localized protein 1 (AHL1), which was isolated by visual screening of transformants using random GFP::cDNA fusions. AHL1 contains an AT-hook motif and unknown conserved PPC (plants and prokaryotes conserved) domain that includes a hydrophobic region. Approximately 30 paralogues were identified in the Arabidopsis genome. Proteins with PPC-like domains are found in Bacteria, Archaea and the plant kingdom, but in Bacteria and Archaea the PPC containing proteins of do not have an AT-hook motif. Thus, the PPC domain is evolutionary conserved and has a new function such as AT-rich DNA binding. AHL1 was mainly localized in the nucleoplasm, but little in the nucleolus and heterochromatic region, and was concentrated in the boundary region between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Biochemically, AHL1 was also found in the nuclear matrix fraction. In the M phase, AHL1 was localized on the chromosomal surface. The AT-hook motif was essential for matrix attachment region (MAR) binding, and the hydrophobic region of the PPC was indispensable for nuclear localization. Our results suggest that AHL1 is a novel plant MAR binding protein, which is related to the positioning of chromatin fibers in the nucleus by the presence of an AT-hook motif and PPC domain. In addition, AHL1 is located on the surface of chromosomes during mitosis.
15047897	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells.	2004	Plant Physiol	The molecular mechanism by which GA regulates plant growth and development has been a subject of active research. Analyses of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences identified 77 WRKY genes, among which OsWRKY71 is highly expressed in aleurone cells. Transient expression of OsWRKY71 by particle bombardment specifically represses GA-induced Amy32b alpha-amylase promoter but not abscisic acid-induced HVA22 or HVA1 promoter activity in aleurone cells. Moreover, OsWRKY71 blocks the activation of the Amy32b promoter by the GA-inducible transcriptional activator OsGAMYB. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor, OsWRKY71 is localized to nuclei of aleurone cells and binds specifically to functionally defined TGAC-containing W boxes of the Amy32b promoter in vitro. Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB. Exogenous GA treatment decreases the steady-state mRNA level of OsWRKY71 and destabilizes the GFP:OsWRKY71 fusion protein. These findings suggest that OsWRKY71 encodes a transcriptional repressor of GA signaling in aleurone cells.
15618416	Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells.	2005	Plant Physiol	The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of regulators that control diverse developmental and physiological processes. This family was believed to be plant specific until the recent identification of WRKY genes in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. We have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences and predicted the structures of 81 OsWRKY genes, 48 of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Eleven OsWRKY proteins contain two conserved WRKY domains, while the rest have only one. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domain sequences provide support for the hypothesis that gene duplication of single- and two-domain WRKY genes, and loss of the WRKY domain, occurred in the evolutionary history of this gene family in rice. The phylogeny deduced from the WRKY domain peptide sequences is further supported by the position and phase of the intron in the regions encoding the WRKY domains. Analyses for chromosomal distributions reveal that 26% of the predicted OsWRKY genes are located on chromosome 1. Among the dozen genes tested, OsWRKY24, -51, -71, and -72 are induced by abscisic acid (ABA) in aleurone cells. Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies of this important superfamily of regulatory genes in monocotyledonous plants and reveals a novel function for WRKY genes, i.e. mediating plant responses to ABA.
16169968	Proanthocyanidin synthesis and expression of genes encoding leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves.	2005	Plant Physiol	Proanthocyanidins (PAs), also called condensed tannins, can protect plants against herbivores and are important quality components of many fruits. Two enzymes, leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), can produce the flavan-3-ol monomers required for formation of PA polymers. We isolated and functionally characterized genes encoding both enzymes from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Shiraz). ANR was encoded by a single gene, but we found two highly related genes encoding LAR. We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, LAR, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion. Grape flowers had high levels of PA, and accumulation continued in skin and seeds from fruit set until the onset of ripening. VvANR was expressed throughout early flower and berry development, with expression increasing after fertilization. It was expressed in berry skin and seeds until the onset of ripening, and in expanding leaves. The genes encoding LAR were expressed in developing fruit, particularly in seeds, but had low expression in leaves. The two LAR genes had different patterns of expression in skin and seeds. During grape ripening, PA levels decreased in both skin and seeds, and expression of genes encoding ANR and LAR were no longer detected. The results indicate that PA accumulation occurs early in grape development and is completed when ripening starts. Both ANR and LAR contribute to PA synthesis in fruit, and the tissue and temporal-specific regulation of the genes encoding ANR and LAR determines PA accumulation and composition during grape berry development.
16384910	The rice mitochondrial genomes and their variations.	2006	Plant Physiol	Based on highly redundant and high-quality sequences, we assembled rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial genomes for two cultivars, 93-11 (an indica variety) and PA64S (an indica-like variety with maternal origin of japonica), which are paternal and maternal strains of an elite superhybrid rice Liang-You-Pei-Jiu (LYP-9), respectively. Following up with a previous analysis on rice chloroplast genomes, we divided mitochondrial sequence variations into two basic categories, intravarietal and intersubspecific. Intravarietal polymorphisms are variations within mitochondrial genomes of an individual variety. Intersubspecific polymorphisms are variations between subspecies among their major genotypes. In this study, we identified 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 25 indels, and three segmental sequence variations as intersubspecific polymorphisms. A signature sequence fragment unique to indica varieties was confirmed experimentally and found in two wild rice samples, but absent in japonica varieties. The intersubspecific polymorphism rate for mitochondrial genomes is 0.02% for SNPs and 0.006% for indels, nearly 2.5 and 3 times lower than that of their chloroplast counterparts and 21 and 38 times lower than corresponding rates of the rice nuclear genome, respectively. The intravarietal polymorphism rates among analyzed mitochondrial genomes, such as 93-11 and PA64S, are 1.26% and 1.38% for SNPs and 1.13% and 1.09% for indels, respectively. Based on the total number of SNPs between the two mitochondrial genomes, we estimate that the divergence of indica and japonica mitochondrial genomes occurred approximately 45,000 to 250,000 years ago.
17012407	The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	To understand the molecular mechanism regulating meristem development in the monocot rice (Oryza sativa), we describe here the isolation and characterization of three floral organ number4 (fon4) alleles and the cloning of the FON4 gene. The fon4 mutants showed abnormal enlargement of the embryonic and vegetative shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and the inflorescence and floral meristems. Likely due to enlarged SAMs, fon4 mutants produced thick culms (stems) and increased numbers of both primary rachis branches and floral organs. We identified FON4 using a map-based cloning approach and found it encodes a small putatively secreted protein, which is the putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene. FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation. Exogenous application of the peptides FON4p and CLV3p corresponding to the CLV3/ESR-related (CLE) motifs of FON4 and CLV3, respectively, resulted in termination of SAMs in rice, and treatment with CLV3p caused consumption of both rice and Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLV pathway in limiting meristem size is conserved in both rice and Arabidopsis. However, exogenous FON4p did not have an obvious effect on limiting both rice and Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLE motifs of Arabidopsis CLV3 and FON4 are potentially functionally divergent.
12430018	The plant PDR family of ABC transporters.	2002	Planta	The plant pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters has been implicated in the transport of antifungal agents. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the entire family of PDR genes present in the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. genome. This analysis both resolves discrepancies in published inventories of plant ABC proteins and provides an expression analysis of all the annotated Arabidopsis PDR genes. The results indicate that the Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding PDR proteins and that these genes show a spectrum of specific expression patterns, both at the organ level and in response to various hormonal, environmental and chemical factors. These data provide a scaffold for the future molecular genetic analysis of this important family of ABC transporters. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of such data by using them to identify an Arabidopsis PDR protein that may play a role in the extrusion of the antifungal diterpene sclareol.

15452707	Structure of the cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase gene family in rice and promoter activity of a member associated with lignification.	2005	Planta	Analysis of lignification in rice has been facilitated by the availability of the recently completed rice genome sequence, and rice will serve as an important model for understanding the relationship of grass lignin composition to cell wall digestibility. Cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is an enzyme important in lignin biosynthesis. The rice genome contains 12 distinct genes present at nine different loci that encode products with significant similarity to CAD. The rice gene family is diverse with respect to other angiosperm and gymnosperm CAD genes isolated to date and includes one member (OsCAD6) that contains a peroxisomal targeting signal and is substantially diverged relative to other family members. Four closely related family members (OsCAD8A-D) are present at the same locus and represent the product of a localized gene duplication and inversion. Promoter-reporter gene fusions to OsCAD2, an orthologue of the CAD gene present at the bm1 (brown midrib 1) locus of maize, reveal that in rice expression is associated with vascular tissue in aerial parts of the plant and is correlated with the onset of lignification. In root tissue, expression is primarily in the cortical parenchyma adjacent to the exodermis and in vascular tissue.
16896793	Characterization and identification of the candidate gene of rice thermo-sensitive genic male sterile gene tms5 by mapping.	2007	Planta	Previous research has demonstrated that the thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) gene in rice was regulated by temperature. TGMS rice is important to hybrid rice production because the application of the TGMS system in two-line breeding is cost-effective, simple, efficient and overcomes the limitations of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system. AnnongS is the first discovered and deeply studied TGMS rice line in China. Previous studies have suggested that AnnongS-1 and Y58S, two derivative TGMS lines of AnnongS, were both controlled by a single recessive gene named tms5, which was genetically mapped on chromosome 2. In the current study, three populations (AnnongS-1 x Nanjing11, Y58S x Q611, and Y58S x Guanghui122) were developed to investigate the tms5 gene molecular map. Analysis of recombination events of sterile samples, utilizing 125 probes covering the tms5 region, suggested that the tms5 gene was physically mapped to a 19 kb DNA fragment between two markers, 4039-1 and 4039-2, located on the BAC clone AP004039. Following the construction of a physical map between the two markers, ONAC023, a member of the NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC-related) gene family, was identified as the candidate of the tms5 gene.
15210936	Identification of an evolutionarily divergent U11 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle in Drosophila.	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Previous reports suggested that U11, in contrast to U12 or other small nuclear (sn)RNAs of the U12-type spliceosome, might be either highly divergent or absent in Drosophila melanogaster. Affinity purification of Drosophila U12-containing complexes has led to the identification of the fly U11 snRNA, which contains a potential U12-type 5' splice-site-interacting sequence, but whose sequence and length differs significantly from vertebrate and plant U11. Analysis of U12-type introns revealed an A-rich region directly downstream of Drosophila, but not human, U12-type 5' splice sites. This finding, coupled with the presence of a highly divergent U11 snRNA, and the apparent absence of Drosophila homologs of human U11 proteins, suggest that U12-type 5' splice site recognition might be different in flies. A comparison of U11 snRNAs that we have identified from vertebrates, plants, and insects, suggests that an evolutionarily divergent U11 snRNA may be unique to Drosophila and not characteristic of insects in general.
8710903	A computer-based systematic survey reveals the predominance of small inverted-repeat elements in wild-type rice genes.	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Several recent reports indicate that mobile elements are frequently found in and flanking many wild-type plant genes. To determine the extent of this association, we performed computer-based systematic searches to identify mobile elements in the genes of two "model" plants, Oryza sativa (domesticated rice) and Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas 32 common sequences belonging to nine putative mobile element families were found in the noncoding regions of rice genes, none were found in Arabidopsis genes. Five of the nine families (Gaijin, Castaway, Ditto, Wanderer, and Explorer) are first described in this report, while the other four were described previously (Tourist, Stowaway, p-SINE1, and Amy/LTP). Sequence similarity, structural similarity, and documentation of past mobility strongly suggests that many of the rice common sequences are bona fide mobile elements. Members of four of the new rice mobile element families are similar in some respects to members of the previously identified inverted-repeat element families, Tourist and Stowaway. Together these elements are the most prevalent type of transposons found in the rice genes surveyed and form a unique collection of inverted-repeat transposons we refer to as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements or MITEs. The sequence and structure of MITEs are clearly distinct from short or long interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs or LINEs), the most common transposable elements associated with mammalian nuclear genes. Mobile elements, therefore, are associated with both animal and plant genes, but the identity of these elements is strikingly different.
15016992	The wheat VRN2 gene is a flowering repressor down-regulated by vernalization.	2004	Science	Plants with a winter growth habit flower earlier when exposed for several weeks to cold temperatures, a process called vernalization. We report here the positional cloning of the wheat vernalization gene VRN2, a dominant repressor of flowering that is down-regulated by vernalization. Loss of function of VRN2, whether by natural mutations or deletions, resulted in spring lines, which do not require vernalization to flower. Reduction of the RNA level of VRN2 by RNA interference accelerated the flowering time of transgenic winter-wheat plants by more than a month.
15965650	Toward closing rice telomere gaps: mapping and sequence characterization of rice subtelomere regions.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Despite the collective efforts of the international community to sequence the complete rice genome, telomeric regions of most chromosome arms remain uncharacterized. In this report we present sequence data from subtelomere regions obtained by analyzing telomeric clones from two 8.8 x genome equivalent 10-kb libraries derived from partial restriction digestion with HaeIII or Sau3AI (OSJNPb HaeIII and OSJNPc Sau3AI). Seven telomere clones were identified and contain 25-100 copies of the telomere repeat (CCCTAAA)(n) on one end and unique sequences on the opposite end. Polymorphic sequence-tagged site markers from five clones and one additional PCR product were genetically mapped on the ends of chromosome arms 2S, 5L, 10S, 10L, 7L, and 7S. We found distinct chromosome-specific telomere-associated tandem repeats (TATR) on chromosome 7 (TATR7) and on the short arm of chromosome 10 (TATR10s) that showed no significant homology to any International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) genomic sequence. The TATR7, a degenerate tandem repeat which is interrupted by transposable elements, appeared on both ends of chromosome 7. The TATR10s was found to contain an inverted array of three tandem repeats displaying an interesting secondary folding pattern that resembles a telomere loop (t-loop) and which may be involved in a protective function against chromosomal end degradation.
16520319	[A universal high-throughput novel method of constructing the vectors].	2006	Yi Chuan	In this paper, a simple universal high-throughput method of constructing the vectors was developed. It could add proper adapter when the PCR primers were designed, and the purpose fragments were cloned by PCR, and the various complementary sticky ends were created by T4 DNA polymerase's 3' -exodeoxyribonuclease activity. If all these fragments were put together with DNA ligase, they would recombinate in an orientation. If they had been transformated, the tansformants would be identified. Let's take the Oryza sativa single-cross homologous recombination chloroplast expression vector pRSMGA which was constructed with seven fragments as an example, if the vector pRSMGA was constructed in using the method what had mentioned, only twice recombination and transformation would be done. Scores of experiments had proved that it is a simple universal high-throughput novel method to construct the complicated vectors, which has not appeared in the periodical.
8939818	A cereal centromeric sequence.	1996	Chromosoma	We report the identification of a family of sequences located by in situ hybridisation to the centromeres of all the Triticeae chromosomes studied, including the supernumerary and midget chromosomes, the centromeres of all maize chromosomes and the heterochromatic regions of rice chromosomes. This family of sequences (CCS1), together with the cereal genome alignments, will allow the evolution of the cereal centromeres and their sites to be studied. The family of sequences also shows homology to the CENP-B box. The centromeres of the cereal species and the proteins that interact with them can now be characterised.
2693947	A full length cDNA clone for the alkaline protease from Aspergillus oryzae: structural analysis and expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	1989	Mol Gen Genet	We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA fragment for the entire coding region of the alkaline protease (Alp) from a filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus oryzae. According to the deduced amino acid sequence, Alp has a putative prepro region of 121 amino acids preceding the mature region, which consists of 282 amino acids. A consensus sequence of a signal peptide consisting of 21 amino acids is found at the N-terminus of the prepro region. The primary structure of the mature region shares extensive homology (29%-44%) with those of subtilisin families, and the three residues (Asp 32, His 64 and Ser 221 in subtilisin BPN') composing the active site are preserved. The entire cDNA, coding for prepro Alp, when introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, directed the secretion of enzymatically active Alp into the culture medium, with its N-terminus and specific activity identical to native Aspergillus Alp.
12872996	A new MITE family, Pangrangja, in Gramineae species.	2003	Mol Cells	The miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) is a type of class II transposon. We have isolated a new MITE, Pangrangja, from the species Oryza. Although Pangrangja elements are present in a number of Gramineae species, they are more prevalent in A genome Oryza species, Triticum, Aegilops, Hordeum, and Tripsacum. The Pangrangja has a 16 bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR) and conserved trinucleotides 5'-TTG-3' and 5'-AAA-3' at both ends. The TIR starts with 5'-CAGT-3', similar to the MITEs of the Emigrant family. The sequences between TIRs are very AT-rich and vary in length from 161 bp in A genome Oryza species to 513 bp in Hordeum vulgare. While the size and sequence of Pangrangia elements are conserved in the A genome Oryza species, there is some sequence variation in other plants. In an analysis of the mobile history of Oryza sativa, eight RESites (related to empty sites) were found and grouped into three types depending on the presence or absence of the conserved trinucleotides 5'-TTG-3' and 5'-AAA-3'. Since one of the RESites showed a perfect palindromic 22 bp sequence into which 180 bp of the Pangrangja element was inserted, the possible role of secondary structure of the palindromic sequences is discussed. We also suggest that as Pangrangja MITE-AFLP has been successful in many different Gramineae, Pangrangja elements may be useful in the genomic analysis of grasses.
16233720	A novel amine oxidase-encoding gene from Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	J Biosci Bioeng	We cloned a novel gene (aoxA) encoding amine oxidase (AOX) from Aspergillus oryzae. One cDNA clone showing extreme homology to the AOX-encoding genes was found in an expressed sequence tag (EST) library of A. oryzae. Molecular analysis revealed that the aoxA carried four exons interrupted by three introns and had an open reading frame encoding 672 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence showed about 83.5% identity to the Aspergillus niger AO-I. The strictly conserved residues for co-factor and copper binding in copper/quinine-containing AOXs were also preserved at Tyr 405, His 456, His 458 and His 617 in the cDNA sequence. When the aoxA was overexpressed in the homologous hyperexpression system of A. oryzae, AOX activity in the transformant was enhanced 75-fold. An apparent molecular weight of 159,000 by gel filtration and a subunit molecular weight of 75,000 by SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme were estimated, suggesting that the enzyme molecule is a homo-dimer similar to other copper/quinine-containing AOXs. The A. oryzae AOXA preferentially oxidized aliphatic monoamines of C2-C6 rather than aromatic amines or diamines. From these results, the aoxA gene product obtained by homologous hyperexpression system of A. oryzae is undoubtedly a functional AOX.
15056900	Adenine auxotrophic mutants of Aspergillus oryzae: development of a novel transformation system with triple auxotrophic hosts.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	adeA and adeB genes homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE1 and ADE2, respectively, were cloned from Aspergillus oryzae. AdeA and AdeB share 62.8% and 52.5% identities with S. cerevisiae Ade1 and Ade2, respectively. In order to obtain triple auxotrophic mutants from A. oryzae, 12 red-colored mutant colonies were isolated by UV mutagenesis of a double auxotrophic host, NS4 (niaD(-), sC(-)), as a parent strain. All the mutants exhibited adenine auxotrophy and showed fluorescence in the vacuoles due to accumulation of a purine biosynthetic pathway precursor. Adenine auxotrophy of all the mutants was restored by introduction of either A. oryzae adeA or adeB genes. Sequence analysis demonstrated that substitutions or deletions of a single base pair occurred, inducing substitutions or frame shifts of amino acid sequences in both ade genes complementing the mutants. This study provides a novel host-vector system with triple auxotrophy in A. oryzae.
1495393	An Aspergillus fumigatus alkaline protease mutant constructed by gene disruption is deficient in extracellular elastase activity.	1992	Mol Microbiol	Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, usually caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, is a life-threatening condition of immunosuppressed patients. We have created a mutant strain of this fungus that lacks an extracellular alkaline protease (AFAlp). This was accomplished by transformation of A. fumigatus with a plasmid containing a selectable marker for hygromycin B resistance, and a 504 bp segment of the AFAlp gene, obtained by polymerase-chain-reaction-based amplification of A. fumigatus genomic DNA. Approximately 25% of transformants resulted from disruption of the AFAlp gene. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins from the culture filtrate of a strain carrying the AFAlp gene disruption showed that it lacked a major protein of 33 kDa. Furthermore, in contrast to the culture filtrate from wild-type cells, the mutant had undetectable activity on azocollagen and elastin-Congo red, over a broad pH range. This shows that AFAlp accounts for most, if not all, of the extracellular elastinolytic activity of A. fumigatus, and that the mutant strain will be useful in assessing the role of AFAlp in pathogenicity.
16040802	Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning reveals rapid evolutionary patterns of centromeric DNA in Oryza species.	2005	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The functional centromeres of rice (Oryza sativa, AA genome) chromosomes contain two key DNA components: the CRR centromeric retrotransposons and a 155-bp satellite repeat, CentO. However, several wild Oryza species lack the CentO repeat. We developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based technique to clone DNA fragments derived from chromatin containing the centromeric histone H3 variant CenH3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning was carried out in the CentO-less species Oryza rhizomatis (CC genome) and Oryza brachyantha (FF genome). Three previously uncharacterized genome-specific satellite repeats, CentO-C1, CentO-C2, and CentO-F, were discovered in the centromeres of these two species. An 80-bp DNA region was found to be conserved in CentO-C1, CentO, and centromeric satellite repeats from maize and pearl millet, species which diverged from rice many millions of years ago. In contrast, the CentO-F repeat shows no sequence similarity to other centromeric repeats but has almost completely replaced other centromeric sequences in O. brachyantha, including the CRR-related sequences that normally constitute a significant fraction of the centromeric DNA in grass species.
15757176	Cloning and characterization of a gene rpg1 encoding polygalacturonase of Rhizopus oryzae.	2004	Mycol Res	The polygalacturonase (PG)-encoding gene (rpg1) of Rhizopus oryzae, the causal pathogen of rhizopus rot of mulberry, was cloned and sequenced. PGs were partially purified from incubation mixture of 2% pectin medium and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by a gas-phase protein sequencer. RT-PCR was performed using degenerate primers designed from the amino acid sequences, which resulted in part of a PG-encoding gene being obtained. By 3'-RACE and TAIL-PCR analyses, the entire region of the PG-encoding gene was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene comprised 1199 bp coding for 383 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 26 amino acids, and the open reading frame was interrupted by single intron of 47 bp. Phylogenetic analysis using the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that R. oryzae RPG1 belonged to a clade consisting of exo-PGs of ascomycete fungi.
16306700	Cloning and characterization of saponin hydrolases from Aspergillus oryzae and Eupenicillium brefeldianum.	2005	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We purified saponin hydrolases from Aspergillus oryzae PF1224 and Eupenicillium brefeldianum PF1226. It was confirmed that the enzymes from A. oryzae PF1224 (Sda1) and E. brefeldianum PF1226 (Sde1) are glycoproteins with molecular masses of 82 and 90 kDa respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of each enzyme from the cloned genes (sda1 or sde1) showed approximately 50% homology with that of the saponin hydrolase Sdn1 from Neocosmospora vasinfecta var. vasinfecta PF1225 (DDBJ accession no. AB110615). When sda1 and sde1 were expressed in the host Trichoderma viride under the control of the cellobiohydrolase I gene promoter, recombinant proteins were secreted with molecular masses of 77 and 67 kDa respectively. These recombinant enzymes hydrolyzed soyasaponin I to soyasapogenol B and triose, and its substrate specificities for glycosides were similar to that of Sdn1, but the specific activities of these enzymes were lower than that of Sdn1.
15502348	Cloning and enhanced expression of the cytochrome P450nor gene (nicA; CYP55A5) encoding nitric oxide reductase from Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We cloned and characterized the gene and cDNA of Aspergillus oryzae cytochrome P450nor (Anor). The Anor gene (nicA; CYP55A5) has a different gene structure from other P450nor genes in that it has an extra intron. There were not only two kinds of mRNA but also two sets of TATA-box and CCAAT-box, and it appears that this gene has two expression patterns, like CYP55A1 of Fusarium oxysporum. A reporter analysis using the uidA gene indicated that gene expression of CYP55A5 was induced under anaerobic conditions, like CYP55A1. When the CYP55A5 gene was overexpressed in A. oryzae, a large amount of active Anor were accumulated as intracellular protein. Anor employed both NADH and NADPH as electron donors for reducing nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. Anor measured the amount of NO generated from 3-(2-Hydroxy-1-(1-methylethyl)-2-nitrosohydrazino)-1-propanamine (NOC5) with a spectrophotometer. The sensitivity was 10 nmol/ml.
16233832	Cloning and expression analysis of two catalase genes from Aspergillus oryzae.	2005	J Biosci Bioeng	Fungi contain distinct genes encoding the same class of enzyme that are differentially regulated according to conditions. We cloned two catalase genes, catA and catB, from Aspergillus oryzae. The catA gene predicts a 747-amino-acid polypeptide sharing 81% identity with Aspergillus fumigatus catalase (catA) and 77% with Aspergillus nidulans catalase (catA). The catB gene predicts a 725-amino-acid polypeptide sharing 82% identity with A. fumigatus catalase (catB) and 75% with A. nidulans catalase (catB). However, the catA and catB genes share little homology (41%) with one another, suggesting that each gene belongs to a distinct gene family. Overexpression studies demonstrated that both genes encode a functional catalase. Promoter assays indicated that the catA gene is developmentally regulated as it was preferentially expressed in solid-state cultures undergoing sporulation. However, its expression was not affected by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Conversely, the catB gene was highly expressed under all culture conditions tested, and it was induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment. These results suggest that the catB gene may be mainly used for detoxification of oxidative stress while the catA gene may have another role such as chaperoning proteins in the spore.
15158278	Cloning and functional characterization of the Rhizopus oryzae high affinity iron permease (rFTR1) gene.	2004	FEMS Microbiol Lett	Rhizopus oryzae is the most common etiologic agent of mucormycosis. Clinical and animal model data clearly demonstrate that the presence of elevated available serum iron predisposes the host to develop mucormycosis. Therefore, the high affinity iron permease (rFTR1) which encodes a protein required to scavenge iron from the environment, is highly likely to be a critical determinant of virulence for R. oryzae. We have cloned rFTR1 by using a PCR approach relying on degenerate primers designed from the conserved regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae high affinity iron permease. Sequence analysis of a 2.0 kb EcoRI genomic clone revealed a single open reading frame of 1107 bp that lacked introns. The putative rFtr1p had significant homology to known fungal high affinity iron permeases from Candida albicans (46% identity) and S. cerevisiae (44% identity). In R. oryzae, rFTR1 was expressed in iron-depleted and not in iron-rich media. Finally, rFTR1 restored the ability of an ftr1 null mutant of S. cerevisiae to grow on iron-limited medium and to take up radiolabeled iron, whereas S. cerevisiae transformed with the empty vector did not. These data demonstrate that we have cloned the gene encoding a R. oryzae high affinity iron permease and the putative rFtr1p is involved in assimilation of iron from iron-depleted environments.
7584030	Cloning and mapping of telomere-associated sequences from rice.	1994	DNA Res	We have isolated three telomere-associated sequences from rice using cassette-ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Each of the obtained clones hybridized to the terminal of one or several rice chromosome arms. The telomeres recognized by the clones displayed a high level of polymorphism between two rice varieties, Nipponbare (a japonica variety) and Kasalath (an indica variety). Variability in the chromosome termini was also detected among individual F2 progeny plants, which were derived from a cross between the two rice varieties. One clone containing telomere-associated sequences was located to one end of chromosome 5, and another clone to one end of chromosome 11. For another clone, non-allelic segregation of polymorphic hybridization bands was observed between japonica and indica rice; this clone was mapped to one end of chromosome 12 in japonica and to one end of chromosome 11 in indica rice. This indicates an exchange of termini between nonhomologous chromosomes.
12596854	Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the glutamate decarboxylase-encoding gene gadA from Aspergillus oryzae.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We cloned a genomic DNA encoding the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) from Aspergillus oryzae using a 200-bp DNA fragment as the probe. This DNA fragment was amplified by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with mRNA of A. oryzae as the template and degenerate primers designed from the conserved amino acid sequence of Escherichia coli GAD and Arabidopsis thaliana GAD. Nucleotide sequencing analysis showed that the cloned gene (designated gadA) encoded 514 amino acid residues and contained three introns. Southern hybridization showed that the gadA gene was on a 6.0-kb SacI fragment and that there was a single copy in the A. oryzae chromosome. The cloned gene was functional, because one transformant of A. oryzae containing multiple copies of the gadA gene had 10-fold the GAD activity and a 12-fold increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid production compared with the control strain.
12723619	Cloning and overexpression of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene nagA from Aspergillus oryzae and enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of human milk oligosaccharide.	2003	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We isolated a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoding gene from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, and designated it nagA. The nagA gene encoded a polypeptide of 600 amino acids with significant similarity to glucosaminidases and hexosaminidases of various eukaryotes. A. oryzae strain carrying the nagA gene under the control of the improved glaA promoter produced large amounts of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in a wheat bran solid culture. The beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was purified from crude extracts of the solid culture by column chromatographies on Q-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200. This enzyme was used for synthesis of lacto-N-triose II, which is contained in human milk. By reverse hydrolysis reaction, lacto-N-triose II and its positional isomer were synthesized from lactose and D-N-acetylglucosamine in 0.21% and 0.15% yield, respectively.
9765593	Cloning, expression, characterization and role of the leader sequence of a lipase from Rhizopus oryzae.	1998	Biochim Biophys Acta	A lipase from Rhizopus oryzae DSM 853 (ROL) was cloned from a chromosomal gene bank, sequenced and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. ROL and its precursors ProROL and PreProROL were purified and their pH and temperature profile was determined. In contrast to ROL, ProROL and PreProROL had considerably higher thermostability and a slightly higher pH optimum. Moreover, it could be demonstrated by in vitro experiments that the natural leader sequence of ROL is able to inhibit the folding supporting properties of the prosequence, resulting in a retardation of folding. In addition, there is strong evidence that all different lipase forms derived from Rhizopus sp. described in the literature are a result of different proteolytic processing and originate from the same gene.
14716498	Cloning, functional analysis and expression of a scytalone dehydratase gene ( SCD1) involved in melanin biosynthesis of the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae.	2004	Curr Genet	Scytalone dehydratase is involved in the production of fungal dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. We isolated and characterized SCD1, a gene encoding scytalone dehydratase, from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae. Sequence analysis showed that SCD1 encodes a putative protein that has 185 amino acids, a molecular weight of 21 kDa and 51-75% sequence identity to other fungal scytalone dehydratases. Targeted disruption of SCD1 showed that this gene is necessary for melanin biosynthesis in B. oryzae. Northern blot analysis showed that SCD1 transcripts are specifically enhanced by near-ultraviolet (300-400 nm) radiation.
15138697	Cloning, functional characterization, and near-ultraviolet radiation-enhanced expression of a photolyase gene (PHR1) from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae.	2004	Curr Genet	Photolyase is a DNA repair enzyme that can absorb blue/ultraviolet A light as energy and split a pyrimidine dimer induced by ultraviolet radiation. We isolated and characterized PHR1, a gene encoding photolyase, from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae. Sequence analysis showed that PHR1 encodes a putative protein that has 634 amino acids, a molecular mass of 72.6 kDa, and 51.3-55.5% sequence identity to other fungal photolyases. Complementation of the photoreactivation-deficient Escherichia coli mutant by PHR1 cDNA demonstrated that the PHR1 gene from B. oryzae encodes a functional photolyase. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the PHR1 transcripts were specifically enhanced by near-ultraviolet radiation (300-400 nm) and by sunlight.
12869764	Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from japonica rice.	2003	Science	We collected and completely sequenced 28,469 full-length complementary DNA clones from Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. Through homology searches of publicly available sequence data, we assigned tentative protein functions to 21,596 clones (75.86%). Mapping of the cDNA clones to genomic DNA revealed that there are 19,000 to 20,500 transcription units in the rice genome. Protein informatics analysis against the InterPro database revealed the existence of proteins presented in rice but not in Arabidopsis. Sixty-four percent of our cDNAs are homologous to Arabidopsis proteins.
15689432	Comparative mitochondrial genomics in zygomycetes: bacteria-like RNase P RNAs, mobile elements and a close source of the group I intron invasion in angiosperms.	2005	Nucleic Acids Res	To generate data for comparative analyses of zygomycete mitochondrial gene expression, we sequenced mtDNAs of three distantly related zygomycetes, Rhizopus oryzae, Mortierella verticillata and Smittium culisetae. They all contain the standard fungal mitochondrial gene set, plus rnpB, the gene encoding the RNA subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P (mtP-RNA) and rps3, encoding ribosomal protein S3 (the latter lacking in R.oryzae). The mtP-RNAs of R.oryzae and of additional zygomycete relatives have the most eubacteria-like RNA structures among fungi. Precise mapping of the 5' and 3' termini of the R.oryzae and M.verticillata mtP-RNAs confirms their expression and processing at the exact sites predicted by secondary structure modeling. The 3' RNA processing of zygomycete mitochondrial mRNAs, SSU-rRNA and mtP-RNA occurs at the C-rich sequence motifs similar to those identified in fission yeast and basidiomycete mtDNAs. The C-rich motifs are included in the mature transcripts, and are likely generated by exonucleolytic trimming of RNA 3' termini. Zygomycete mtDNAs feature a variety of insertion elements: (i) mtDNAs of R.oryzae and M.verticillata were subject to invasions by double hairpin elements; (ii) genes of all three species contain numerous mobile group I introns, including one that is closest to an intron that invaded angiosperm mtDNAs; and (iii) at least one additional case of a mobile element, characterized by a homing endonuclease insertion between partially duplicated genes [Paquin,B., Laforest,M.J., Forget,L., Roewer,I., Wang,Z., Longcore,J. and Lang,B.F. (1997) Curr. Genet., 31, 380-395]. The combined mtDNA-encoded proteins contain insufficient phylogenetic signal to demonstrate monophyly of zygomycetes.
15587062	Conspecificity of the cerulenin and helvolic acid producing 'Cephalosporium caerulens', and the hypocrealean fungus Sarocladium oryzae.	2004	Mycol Res	Fermentation processes for the biochemical reagents cerulenin and helvolic acid employ 'Cephalosporium caerulens,' an invalidly published designation that has been used for more than 40 years. However, its identity has never been critically examined because strains were unavailable from major culture collections. An authentic strain of C. caerulens', derived from the original strain KF-140, was recently found and compared to Sarocladium oryzae, another Acremonium-like fungus which also produces cerulenin and helvolic acid. Morphological comparisons, rDNA sequence data, and chromatography of secondary metabolites established that 'C. caerulens' and S. oryzae are conspecific. Sequence data from ribosomal DNA genes indicated S. oryzae belongs to the Hypocreales and is allied with members of the Ceratostomataceae, Scopinella species, Emericellopsis species and certain Acremonium-like anamorphs of uncertain familial relationships. At least two of the isolates of S. oryzae produced titres of cerulenin and helvolic acid similar to those of KF-140. This finding demonstrates that manufacture of cerulenin need not be limited to the original strain.
15845386	Discovery of a novel superfamily of type III polyketide synthases in Aspergillus oryzae.	2005	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Identification of genes encoding type III polyketide synthase (PKS) superfamily members in the industrially useful filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae, revealed that their distribution is not specific to plants or bacteria. Among other Aspergilli (Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus), A. oryzae was unique in possessing four chalcone synthase (CHS)-like genes (csyA, csyB, csyC, and csyD). Expression of csyA, csyB, and csyD genes was confirmed by RT-PCR. Comparative genome analyses revealed single putative type III PKS in Neurospora crassa and Fusarium graminearum, two each in Magnaporthe grisea and Podospora anserina, and three in Phenarocheate chrysosporium, with a phylogenic distinction from bacteria and plants. Conservation of catalytic residues in the CHSs across species implicated enzymatically active nature of these newly discovered homologs.
15302836	Disordered cell integrity signaling caused by disruption of the kexB gene in Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	Eukaryot Cell	We isolated the kexB gene, which encodes a subtilisin-like processing enzyme, from a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae. To examine the physiological role of kexB in A. oryzae, we constructed a kexB disruptant (DeltakexB), which formed shrunken colonies with poor generation of conidia on Czapek-Dox (CD) agar plates and hyperbranched mycelia in CD liquid medium. The phenotypes of the DeltakexB strain were restored under high osmolarity in both solid and liquid culture conditions. We found that transcription of the mpkA gene, which encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein kinase involved in cell integrity signaling, was significantly higher in DeltakexB cells than in wild-type cells. The DeltakexB cells also contained higher levels of transcripts for cell wall-related genes encoding beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase and chitin synthases, which is presumably attributable to cell integrity signaling through the increased gene expression of mpkA. As expected, constitutively increased levels of phosphorylated MpkA were observed in DeltakexB cells on the CD plate culture. High osmotic stress greatly downregulated the increased levels of both transcripts of mpkA and the phosphorylated form of MpkA in DeltakexB cells, concomitantly suppressing the morphological defects. These results suggest that the upregulation of transcription levels of mpkA and cell wall biogenesis genes in the DeltakexB strain is autoregulated by phosphorylated MpkA as the active form through cell integrity signaling. We think that KexB is required for precise proteolytic processing of sensor proteins in the cell integrity pathway or of cell wall-related enzymes under transcriptional control by the pathway and that the KexB defect thus induces disordered cell integrity signaling.
15716045	Evidence for an evolutionary force that prevents epigenetic silencing between tail-to-tail rice genes with a short spacer.	2005	Gene	During the course of evolution, the genome should have toned down various types of genomic noise, such as those that cause the unstable expression or gene silencing observed in transgenic organisms. We found a rice genomic segment where two genes, encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPs) and ribosomal protein small subunit 20 (rps20), are located in a tail-to-tail orientation and separated by only 300 bp of spacer. It is possible that this kind of structure would give rise to unstable expression due to antisense RNA derived from the neighboring gene. We examined this possibility using Northern blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 3' RACE analyses, but obtained no evidence for instability or antisense RNAs of these housekeeping genes. Comparison of the sequences in the corresponding regions among related rice species revealed a lower level of genetic divergence of both the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) than of the other noncoding regions; in particular both of the boundaries between the 3'-UTRs and the spacer were markedly conserved. The conservation of both the terminal regions is most likely the result of purifying selection, implying a functional role for the strict termination of the transcription of these genes to prevent gene-silencing-related events.
14717841	Expression of THR1, a 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase gene involved in melanin biosynthesis in the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae, is enhanced by near-ultraviolet radiation.	2004	Pigment Cell Res	1,3,8-Trihydroxynaphthalene (1,3,8-THN) reductase is involved in the production of fungal dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin. We isolated and characterized THR1, a gene encoding 1,3,8-THN reductase, from the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae. Sequence analysis showed that THR1 encodes a putative protein of 267 amino acids having a molecular weight of 28.5 kDa and 68-98% sequence identity to other fungal 1,3,8-THN reductases. Targeted disruption of the THR1 gene showed that it is essential for melanin biosynthesis in B. oryzae. Northern blot analysis showed that THR1 transcripts are constitutively expressed during normal growth but are specifically enhanced by near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that THR1 expression is transcriptionally enhanced by NUV radiation in B. oryzae.
15466528	Functional analysis of fructosyl-amino acid oxidases of Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	Appl Environ Microbiol	Three active fractions of fructosyl-amino acid oxidase (FAOD-Ao1, -Ao2a, and -Ao2b) were isolated from Aspergillus oryzae strain RIB40. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of FAOD-Ao2a corresponded to those of FAOD-Ao2b, suggesting that these two isozymes were derived from the same protein. FAOD-Ao1 and -Ao2 were different in substrate specificity and subunit assembly; FAOD-Ao2 was active toward N(epsilon)-fructosyl N(alpha)-Z-lysine and fructosyl valine (Fru-Val), whereas FAOD-Ao1 was not active toward Fru-Val. The genes encoding the FAOD isozymes (i.e., FAOAo1 and FAOAo2) were cloned by PCR with an FAOD-specific primer set. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that FAOD-Ao1 was 50% identical to FAOD-Ao2, and each isozyme had a peroxisome-targeting signal-1, indicating their localization in peroxisomes. The genes was expressed in Escherichia coli and rFaoAo2 showed the same characteristics as FAOD-Ao2, whereas rFaoAo1 was not active. FAOAo2 disruptant was obtained by using ptrA as a selective marker. Wild-type strain grew on the medium containing Fru-Val as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, but strain Delta faoAo2 did not grow. Addition of glucose or (NH(4))(2)SO(4) to the Fru-Val medium did not affect the assimilation of Fru-Val by wild-type, indicating glucose and ammonium repressions did not occur in the expression of the FAOAo2 gene. Furthermore, conidia of the wild-type strain did not germinate on the medium containing Fru-Val and NaNO(2) as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, suggesting that Fru-Val may also repress gene expression of nitrite reductase. These results indicated that FAOD is needed for utilization of fructosyl-amino acids as nitrogen sources in A. oryzae.
1339327	Functional elements of the promoter region of the Aspergillus oryzae glaA gene encoding glucoamylase.	1992	Curr Genet	Analysis was made of the promoter region of the Aspergillus oryzae glaA gene encoding glucoamylase. Northern blots using a glucoamylase cDNA as a probe indicated that the amount of mRNA corresponding to the glaA gene increased when expression was induced by starch or maltose. The promoter region of the glaA gene was fused to the Escherichia coli uidA gene, encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS), and the resultant plasmid was introduced into A. oryzae. Expression of GUS protein in the A. oryzae transformants was induced by maltose, indicating that the glaA-GUS gene was regulated at the level of transcription in the presence of maltose. The nucleotide sequence 1.1 kb upstream of the glaA coding region was determined. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the A. oryzae glaA promoter with those of A. oryzae amyB, encoding alpha-amylase, and A. niger glaA showed two regions with similar sequences. Deletion and site-specific mutation analysis of these homologous regions indicated that both are essential for direct high-level expression when grown on maltose.
15278242	Genetic diversity in Rhizopus oryzae strains as revealed by the sequence of lactate dehydrogenase genes.	2004	Arch Microbiol	Twenty-seven strains of Rhizopus oryzae accumulating predominantly lactic acid were shown to possess two ldh genes, ldhA and ldhB, encoding NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenases. Variation in nucleotide sequence was identified for each gene from different strains, and similar phylogenetic trees were obtained based on the nucleotide sequences of both genes. The other 21 strains of R. oryzae accumulating predominantly fumaric and malic acids contained a single ORF of ldhB. Compared to the strains accumulating predominantly lactic acid, a lower degree of sequence divergence was found in ldhB, resulting in a separate cluster in the phylogenetic tree. The high similarity (>90%) spanning the ORF and adjacent regions demonstrates that ldhA and ldhB are derived from the same ancestor gene. The strains accumulating predominantly fumaric and malic acids lack functional ldhA, which plays a role in lactic acid synthesis and may form a lineage separated from the strains accumulating predominantly lactic acid in the genus Rhizopus.
15978416	Genetic identification and detection of human pathogenic Rhizopus species, a major mucormycosis agent, by multiplex PCR based on internal transcribed spacer region of rRNA gene.	2005	J Dermatol Sci	BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis is an invasive opportunistic infection caused by fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. Due to the lack of laboratory tests, the diagnosis of mucormycosis is notoriously difficult. Added with its rapid progression as well as the debilitated state of the patients who contract the disease, mortality is extremely high.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to genetically identify human pathogenic Rhizopus species, a major mucormycosis agent, by the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rRNA gene.

METHODS: Primers were designed to identify five Rhizopus species known to cause human disease by multiplex PCR. PCR was done not only with test strains and clinical isolates, but also with clinical samples from cutaneous mucormycosis patients. Sporangiospore morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy to confirm the correlation of phenotypic and genotypic features.

RESULTS: Multiplex PCR identified five Rhizopus species including Rhizopus oryzae, where R. azygosporus could only be distinguished from R. microsporus by certain polymorphisms that were present in its sequence. When this multiplex PCR was applied to clinical samples from three mucormycosis patients (paraffin sections from all and sera from one patient), Rhizopus DNA corresponding to the isolated pathogens were specifically detected.

CONCLUSION: While fungal DNA detection from clinical samples is a rigorously studied area, this is the first report to genetically identify and detect Rhizopus species from human mucormycosis specimens. This may expand the possibility of this multiplex PCR system not only to identify isolated fungi, but also as a screening method for visceral mucormycosis.
16372010	Genome sequencing and analysis of Aspergillus oryzae.	2005	Nature	The genome of Aspergillus oryzae, a fungus important for the production of traditional fermented foods and beverages in Japan, has been sequenced. The ability to secrete large amounts of proteins and the development of a transformation system have facilitated the use of A. oryzae in modern biotechnology. Although both A. oryzae and Aspergillus flavus belong to the section Flavi of the subgenus Circumdati of Aspergillus, A. oryzae, unlike A. flavus, does not produce aflatoxin, and its long history of use in the food industry has proved its safety. Here we show that the 37-megabase (Mb) genome of A. oryzae contains 12,074 genes and is expanded by 7-9 Mb in comparison with the genomes of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Comparison of the three aspergilli species revealed the presence of syntenic blocks and A. oryzae-specific blocks (lacking synteny with A. nidulans and A. fumigatus) in a mosaic manner throughout the genome of A. oryzae. The blocks of A. oryzae-specific sequence are enriched for genes involved in metabolism, particularly those for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Specific expansion of genes for secretory hydrolytic enzymes, amino acid metabolism and amino acid/sugar uptake transporters supports the idea that A. oryzae is an ideal microorganism for fermentation.
9872797	Homologs of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes and sequence of aflR in Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus sojae.	1999	Appl Environ Microbiol	The presence, but not expression, of homologs of three structural genes and a regulatory gene necessary for aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus and A. flavus was shown for A. oryzae and A. sojae. Homologs of the regulatory gene aflR were cloned and sequenced from A. oryzae and A. sojae.
15336395	Insertional mutagenesis and characterization of a polyketide synthase gene (PKS1) required for melanin biosynthesis in Bipolaris oryzae.	2004	FEMS Microbiol Lett	A polyketide synthase gene named PKS1, involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway of the phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae, was isolated using restriction enzyme-mediated integration. Sequence analysis showed that the PKS1 encodes a putative protein that has 2155 amino acids and significant similarity to other fungal polyketide synthases. Targeted disruption of the PKS1 gene showed that it is necessary for melanin biosynthesis in B. oryzae. Northern blot analysis showed that PKS1 transcripts were specifically enhanced by near-ultraviolet radiation (300-400 nm) and that its temporal transcriptional patterns were similar to those of THR1 and SCD1 genes involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway of B. oryzae.
15388959	Isolation of a novel promoter for efficient protein production in Aspergillus oryzae.	2004	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	A novel protein overexpression system of Aspergillus oryzae was constructed. Five promoters which originate from A. oryzae expressed sequence tag (EST) clones in submerged culture were obtained by genome walking. These were subjected to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter assays. The promoter of manganese superoxide dismutase-encoding gene (sodM) showed the most GUS production. The sodM gene was abundantly expressed in submerged culture but little expressed in solid-state culture. The sodM promoter was approximately 3-fold induced by the addition of 0.01% H2O2. Glucoamylase production in A. oryzae using the sodM promoter led to secretion of approximately 1 g/l-broth in Czapek-Dox medium for 3 d. Fucose lectin production in A. oryzae using the sodM promoter led to overexpression as a specific and abundant intracellular protein.
12092808	Molecular cloning and overexpression of fleA gene encoding a fucose-specific lectin of Aspergillus oryzae.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	A protein from the cell lysate of Aspergillus oryzae was purified by column chromatography immobilized with a ferrichrysin (Fcy), which is one of the siderophores of A. oryzae. It is produced only in an iron-deficient culture and its molecular weight is estimated as 35,000 by SDS-PAGE. Two internal amino acid sequences of the protein obtained by lysylendopeptidase digestion were analyzed. Molecular cloning shows that it encodes 310 putative amino acid residues separated by 4 introns and is designated as fleA. It shows approximately 26% similarity with the gene encoding a fucose-specific lectin of Aleuria aurantia (AAL). The gene was overexpressed under control of the melO promoter in a submerged culture of A. oryzae. The fleA gene product showed hemagglutination activity against rabbit erythrocytes. A hemagglutination inhibition assay of monosaccharides showed that this lectin specifically binds to L-fucose and weakly reacts with mannose and N-acetyl-neuraminic acid.
11999400	Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression analysis of the xynF3 gene from Aspergillus oryzae.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The gene encoding xylanase F3 (xynF3) was isolated from a genomic library of Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, used for making shoyu koji. The structural part of xynF3 was found to be 1468 bp. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynF3 was interrupted by ten short introns and encoded 323 amino acids. Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynF3 had a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynF3 has strong similarity to other family 10 xylanases from fungi. The xynF3 gene was successfully overexpressed in A. oryzae and the XynF3 was purified. The molecular mass of XynF3 estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 32,000. This was almost the same as the molecular mass of 32,437 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. The purified XynF3 showed an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 58 degrees C. It had a Km of 6.5 mg/ml and a Vmax of 435 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) when birch wood xylan was used as a substrate. Expression of the xynF3 gene was analyzed using an Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene as a reporter. The result indicated that xynF3 is expressed in the medium containing wheat bran as a carbon source.
11210150	Molecular cloning, overexpression, and purification of a major xylanase from Aspergillus oryzae.	2000	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The gene encoding xylanase G2 (xynG2) was isolated from a genomic library of Aspergillus oryzae KBN616, used for making shoyu koji. The structural part of xynG2 was found to be 767 bp. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA amplified by RT-PCR showed that the open reading frame of xynG2 was interrupted by a single intron which was 71 bp in size and encoded 232 amino acids. Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynG2 had a signal peptide of 44 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynG2 has strong similarity to other family 11 xylanases from fungi. The xynG2 gene was successfully overexpressed in A. oryzae and the overpexpressed XynG2 was purified. The molecular weight of XynG2 estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 21,000. This was almost the same as the molecular weight of 20,047 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. The purified XynG2 showed an optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 58 degrees C. It had a Km of 5.1 mg/ml and a Vmax of 123 micromol/min/mg when birch wood xylan was used as a substrate.
15555943	Molecular cloning, overexpression, and purification of Micrococcus luteus K-3-type glutaminase from Aspergillus oryzae RIB40.	2004	Protein Expr Purif	We have for the first time found and cloned the cDNA (AoglsA) of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40, which encodes a 49.9-kDa protein sharing 40% homology with the salt-tolerant glutaminase of Micrococcus luteus K-3 (Micrococcus glutaminase). AoglsA was subcloned into a series of expression vectors and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. The gene product, which we named AoGls, showed glutaminase activity and was produced in a cell wall fraction of S. cerevisiae and a soluble protein in E. coli. The highest expression level of 186 U/mg was obtained when the AoglsA was inserted into six bases downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of pKK223-3 and expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). AoGls was purified by SuperQ-TOYOPEARL, glutamine affinity chromatography, and Butyl-TOYOPEARL. This is the first report on the overexpression and purification of a M. luteus K-3-type glutaminase cloned from an eucaryote.
15951485	Mutational decay and age of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes transferred recently to angiosperm nuclear chromosomes.	2005	Plant Physiol	Transfers of organelle DNA to the nucleus established several thousand functional genes in eukaryotic chromosomes over evolutionary time. Recent transfers have also contributed nonfunctional plastid (pt)- and mitochondrion (mt)-derived DNA (termed nupts and numts, respectively) to plant nuclear genomes. The two largest transferred organelle genome copies are 131-kb nuptDNA in rice (Oryza sativa) and 262-kb numtDNA in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These transferred copies were compared in detail with their bona fide organelle counterparts, to which they are 99.77% and 99.91% identical, respectively. No evidence for purifying selection was found in either nuclear integrant, indicating that they are nonfunctional. Mutations attributable to 5-methylcytosine hypermutation have occurred at a 6- to 10-fold higher rate than other point mutations in Arabidopsis numtDNA and rice nuptDNA, respectively, revealing this as a major mechanism of mutational decay for these transferred organelle sequences. Short indels occurred preferentially within homopolymeric stretches but were less frequent than point mutations. The 131-kb nuptDNA is absent in the O. sativa subsp. indica or Oryza rufipogon nuclear genome, suggesting that it was transferred within the O. sativa subsp. japonica lineage and, as revealed by sequence comparisons, after its divergence from the indica chloroplast lineage. The time of the transfer for the rice nupt was estimated as 148,000 (74,000--296,000) years ago and that for the Arabidopsis numtDNA as 88,000 (44,000--176,000) years ago. The results reveal transfer and integration of entire organelle genomes into the nucleus as an ongoing evolutionary process and uncover mutational mechanisms affecting organelle genomes recently transferred into a new mutational environment.
15710378	N-terminal peptide of Rhizopus oryzae lipase is important for its catalytic properties.	2005	FEBS Lett	In a culture medium, the Rhizopus oryzae strain produces only one form of lipase, ROL32. When the concentrated culture medium was stored at 0 degrees C during several months or kept at 6 degrees C during a few days, we noticed the appearance of a second shorter form of ROL32 lacking its N-terminal 28 amino acid (ROL29). ROL29 was purified to homogeneity and its 21 N-terminal amino acid residues were found to be identical to the 29-49 sequence of ROL32. The cleavage of the N-terminal peptide reduced the specific activity of ROL29 by 50% using either triolein or tributyrin as substrates. In order to explain this decrease of the specific activity of ROL29, we measured its critical surface pressure of penetration into phosphatidyl choline from egg yolk films which was found to be 10 mN/m, in contrast to a value of 23 mN/m found in ROL32. A kinetic study on the surface pressure dependency, stereoselectivity and regioselectivity of ROL29 was performed using the three dicaprin isomers spread as monomolecular films at the air-water interface. Our results showed that in contrast to ROL32, ROL29 presented a preference for the distal ester groups of one diglyceride isomer (1,3-sn-dicaprin). Furthermore, ROL32 was markedly more stereoselective than ROL29 for the sn-3 position of the 2,3-sn-enantiomer of dicaprin. A structural explanation of the enhanced penetration capacity as well as the catalytic activity of ROL32 was proposed by molecular modeling. We concluded that the N-terminal peptide of ROL32 can play an important role in the specific activity, the regioselectivity, the stereoselectivity and the binding of the enzyme to its substrate.

15802503	Origins of host-specific populations of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in crop domestication with subsequent expansion of pandemic clones on rice and weeds of rice.	2005	Genetics	Rice, as a widely and intensively cultivated crop, should be a target for parasite host shifts and a source for shifts to co-occurring weeds. Magnaporthe oryzae, of the M. grisea species complex, is the most important fungal pathogen of rice, with a high degree of host specificity. On the basis of 10 loci from six of its seven linkage groups, 37 multilocus haplotypes among 497 isolates of M. oryzae from rice and other grasses were identified. Phylogenetic relationships among isolates from rice (Oryza sativa), millet (Setaria spp.), cutgrass (Leersia hexandra), and torpedo grass (Panicum repens) were predominantly tree like, consistent with a lack of recombination, but from other hosts were reticulate, consistent with recombination. The single origin of rice-infecting M. oryzae followed a host shift from a Setaria millet and was closely followed by additional shifts to weeds of rice, cutgrass, and torpedo grass. Two independent estimators of divergence time indicate that these host shifts predate the Green Revolution and could be associated with rice domestication. The rice-infecting lineage is characterized by high copy number of the transposable element MGR586 (Pot3) and, except in two haplotypes, by a loss of AVR-Co39. Both mating types have been retained in ancestral, well-distributed rice-infecting haplotypes 10 (mainly temperate) and 14 (mainly tropical), but only one mating type was recovered from several derived, geographically restricted haplotypes. There is evidence of a common origin of both ACE1 virulence genotypes in haplotype 14. Host-haplotype association is evidenced by low pathogenicity on hosts associated with other haplotypes.
15650813	Phylogenetic analysis of Oryza species, based on simple sequence repeats and their flanking nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Simple sequence repeats (SSR) and their flanking regions in the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes were sequenced in order to reveal DNA sequence variation. This information was used to gain new insights into phylogenetic relationships among species in the genus Oryza. Seven mitochondrial and five chloroplast SSR loci equal to or longer than ten mononucleotide repeats were chosen from known rice mitochondrial and chloroplast genome sequences. A total of 50 accessions of Oryza that represented six different diploid genomes and three different allopolyploid genomes of Oryza species were analyzed. Many base substitutions and deletions/insertions were identified in the SSR loci as well as their flanking regions. Of mononucleotide SSR, G (or C) repeats were more variable than A (or T) repeats. Results obtained by chloroplast and mitochondrial SSR analyses showed similar phylogenetic relationships among species, although chloroplast SSR were more informative because of their higher sequence diversity. The CC genome is suggested to be the maternal parent for the two BBCC genome species (O. punctata and O. minuta) and the CCDD species O. latifolia, based on the high level of sequence conservation between the diploid CC genome species and these allotetraploid species. This is the first report of phylogenetic analysis among plant species, based on mitochondrial and chloroplast SSR and their flanking sequences.
15046309	Quantitative PCR analysis of selected Aspergillus, Penicillium and Paecilomyces species.	2004	Syst Appl Microbiol	A total of 65 quantitative PCR (QPCR) assays, incorporating fluorigenic 5' nuclease (TaqMan) chemistry and directed at the nuclear ribosomal RNA operon, internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 or ITS2) was developed and tested for the detection of selected Aspergillus, Penicillium and Paecilomyces species. The assays varied in specificity from species or subspecies to closely related species groups, subject to the amount of nucleotide sequence variation in the different organisms. A generic assay for all target species of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Paecilomyces was also developed and tested. Using a previously reported DNA extraction method, estimated conidia detection limits for target species ranged from less than one to several hundred per sample for the different assays. Conidia detection limits for non-target species were at least 1,000 fold higher in nearly all instances. The assays were used to analyze ten HVAC dust samples from different sources around the US. Total quantities of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Paecilomyces conidia in the samples, determined by the generic assay and the summed totals from the specific assays, were in general agreement, suggesting that all of the numerically dominant species in the samples were accounted for by the specific assays. QPCR analyses of these samples after spiking them with selected target organisms indicated that the enumeration results were within approximately a one-half log range of the expected values 95% of the time. Evidence is provided that the commonly used practices of enumerating Aspergillus and Penicillium as a single group or only by genus can be misleading in understanding the indoor populations of these organisms and their potential health risks.
15488154	Reconstruction of putative DNA virus from endogenous rice tungro bacilliform virus-like sequences in the rice genome: implications for integration and evolution.	2004	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant genomes contain various kinds of repetitive sequences such as transposable elements, microsatellites, tandem repeats and virus-like sequences. Most of them, with the exception of virus-like sequences, do not allow us to trace their origins nor to follow the process of their integration into the host genome. Recent discoveries of virus-like sequences in plant genomes led us to set the objective of elucidating the origin of the repetitive sequences. Endogenous rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV)-like sequences (ERTBVs) have been found throughout the rice genome. Here, we reconstructed putative virus structures from RTBV-like sequences in the rice genome and characterized to understand evolutionary implication, integration manner and involvements of endogenous virus segments in the corresponding disease response.

RESULTS: We have collected ERTBVs from the rice genomes. They contain rearranged structures and no intact ORFs. The identified ERTBV segments were shown to be phylogenetically divided into three clusters. For each phylogenetic cluster, we were able to make a consensus alignment for a circular virus-like structure carrying two complete ORFs. Comparisons of DNA and amino acid sequences suggested the closely relationship between ERTBV and RTBV. The Oryza AA-genome species vary in the ERTBV copy number. The species carrying low-copy-number of ERTBV segments have been reported to be extremely susceptible to RTBV. The DNA methylation state of the ERTBV sequences was correlated with their copy number in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS: These ERTBV segments are unlikely to have functional potential as a virus. However, these sequences facilitate to establish putative virus that provided information underlying virus integration and evolutionary relationship with existing virus. Comparison of ERTBV among the Oryza AA-genome species allowed us to speculate a possible role of endogenous virus segments against its related disease.
8752869	RNA editing of transcripts of the gene for apocytochrome b (cob) in rice mitochondria.	1996	Genes Genet Syst	RNA editing was examined in rice mitochondrial apocytochrome b (cob) transcripts. Nineteen C-U conversions were found, and most of them changed the polypeptide sequence encoded by genomic DNA sequence. Evidence for partial and excess editing was also found.

15616142	Structure, divergence, and distribution of the CRR centromeric retrotransposon family in rice.	2005	Mol Biol Evol	The centromeric retrotransposon (CR) family in the grass species is one of few Ty3-gypsy groups of retroelements that preferentially transpose into highly specialized chromosomal domains. It has been demonstrated in both rice and maize that CRR (CR of rice) and CRM (CR of maize) elements are intermingled with centromeric satellite DNA and are highly concentrated within cytologically defined centromeres. We collected all of the CRR elements from rice chromosomes 1, 4, 8, and 10 that have been sequenced to high quality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CRR elements are structurally diverged into four subfamilies, including two autonomous subfamilies (CRR1 and CRR2) and two nonautonomous subfamilies (noaCRR1 and noaCRR2). The CRR1/CRR2 elements contain all characteristic protein domains required for retrotransposition. In contrast, the noaCRR elements have different structures, containing only a gag or gag-pro domain or no open reading frames. The CRR and noaCRR elements share substantial sequence similarity in regions required for DNA replication and for recognition by integrase during retrotransposition. These data, coupled with the presence of young noaCRR elements in the rice genome and similar chromosomal distribution patterns between noaCRR1 and CRR1/CRR2 elements, suggest that the noaCRR elements were likely mobilized through the retrotransposition machinery from the autonomous CRR elements. Mechanisms of the targeting specificity of the CRR elements, as well as their role in centromere function, are discussed.
12702266	Systematics of basidiomycetous yeasts: a comparison of large subunit D1/D2 and internal transcribed spacer rDNA regions.	2002	FEMS Yeast Res	Basidiomycetous yeasts in the Urediniomycetes and Hymenomycetes were examined by sequence analysis in two ribosomal DNA regions: the D1/D2 variable domains at the 5' end of the large subunit rRNA gene (D1/D2) and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2. Four major lineages were recognized in each class: Microbotryum, Sporidiobolus, Erythrobasidium and Agaricostilbum in the Urediniomycetes; Tremellales, Trichosporonales, Filobasidiales and Cystofilobasidiales in the Hymenomycetes. Bootstrap support for many of the clades within those lineages is weak; however, phylogenetic analysis provides a focal point for in-depth study of biological relationships. Combined sequence analysis of the D1/D2 and ITS regions is recommended for species identification, while species definition requires classical biological information such as life cycles and phenotypic characterization.
1718614	The rice mitochondrial nad3 gene has an extended reading frame at its 5' end: nucleotide sequence analysis of rice trnS, nad3, and rps12 genes.	1991	Curr Genet	The nucleotide sequences of the tRNASer (trnS), pseudo-tRNA, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (nad3), and ribosomal protein S12 (rps12) genes from rice mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were determined. Both trnS and nad3 were confirmed to be single copy genes by Southern blot analysis. The nad3 and rps12 genes were arranged in tandem, and the two were co-transcribed. The order of the above four genes in rice mtDNA differed from the linear order observed for the wheat and maize genes. In rice mitochondria, the trnS and pseudo-tRNA genes were found upstream of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, instead of the nad3 and rps12 genes as observed in maize and wheat. Additionally, while the rice nad3 and rps12 genes remain paired, they too are in a different sequence environment from the wheat and maize genes. The apparent split of the two pairs of genes indicates the occurrence of a mitochondrial intramolecular recombinational event. Another peculiarity is that the sequence upstream of the translational initiation codon of the rice nad3 gene is different from that of the wheat and maize versions. The ATG initiation codon of wheat and maize nad3 is replaced by TTG in the rice nad3. A subsequent deduction of the amino acid sequence, accompanied by a primer extension analysis, indicates that the predicted rice NAD3 protein has an additional 37 amino acid residues at its N-terminus compared to the wheat and maize NAD3 proteins. cDNA sequence analysis showed no introns or the occurrence of RNA editing at the newly replaced TTG codon.
16094432	Use of tall fescue EST-SSR markers in phylogenetic analysis of cool-season forage grasses.	2005	Genome	Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are highly useful molecular markers for plant improvement. Expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR markers have a higher rate of transferability across species than genomic SSR markers and are thus well suited for application in cross-species phylogenetic studies. Our objectives were to examine the amplification of tall fescue EST-SSR markers in 12 grass species representing 8 genera of 4 tribes from 2 subfamilies of Poaceae and the applicability of these markers for phylogenetic analysis of grass species. About 43% of the 145 EST-SSR primer pairs produced PCR bands in all 12 grass species and had high levels of polymorphism in all forage grasses studied. Thus, these markers will be useful in a variety of forage grass species, including the ones tested in this study. SSR marker data were useful in grouping genotypes within each species. Lolium temulentum, a potential model species for cool-season forage grasses, showed a close relation with the major Festuca-Lolium species in the study. Tall wheat grass was found to be closely related to hexaploid wheat, thereby confirming the known taxonomic relations between these species. While clustering of closely related species was found, the effectiveness of such data in evaluating distantly related species needs further investigations. The phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of selected SSR bands were in agreement with the phylogenetic relations based on length polymorphism of SSRs markers. Tall fescue EST-SSR markers depicted phylogenetic relations among a wide range of cool-season forage grass species and thus are an important resource for researchers working with such grass species.
16774645	Mutations in the eIF(iso)4G translation initiation factor confer high resistance of rice to Rice yellow mottle virus.	2006	Plant J	We report here evidence of the role that the isoform of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF(iso)4G) plays in naturally occurring resistance in plant/virus interactions. A genetic and physical mapping approach was developed to isolate the Rymv1 locus controlling the high recessive resistance to Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) in the rice (Oryza sativa) variety Gigante. The locus was mapped to a 160-kb interval containing a gene from the eIF(iso)4G family. The stable transformation of a resistant line with the cDNA of this gene, derived from a susceptible variety, resulted in the loss of resistance in transgenic plants. The allelic variability of this gene was analysed in three resistant and 17 susceptible varieties from different cultivated rice species or subspecies. Compared with susceptible varieties, resistant varieties present specific alleles, characterized by either amino acid substitutions or short amino-acid deletions in the middle domain of the protein. The structure of this domain was modelled and showed that the substitutions were clustered on a small surface patch. This suggests that this domain may be involved in an interaction with the virus.
16926158	Cloning and characterization of deoxymugineic acid synthase genes from graminaceous plants.	2006	J Biol Chem	Graminaceous plants have evolved a unique mechanism to acquire iron through the secretion of a family of small molecules, called mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). All MAs are synthesized from l-Met, sharing the same pathway from l-Met to 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA). DMA is synthesized through the reduction of a 3''-keto intermediate by deoxymugineic acid synthase (DMAS). We have isolated DMAS genes from rice (OsDMAS1), barley (HvDMAS1), wheat (TaD-MAS1), and maize (ZmDMAS1). Their nucleotide sequences indicate that OsDMAS1 encodes a predicted polypeptide of 318 amino acids, whereas the other three orthologs all encode predicted polypeptides of 314 amino acids and are highly homologous (82-97.5%) to each other. The DMAS proteins belong to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily 4 (AKR4) but do not fall within the existing subfamilies of AKR4 and appear to constitute a new subfamily within the AKR4 group. All of the proteins showed DMA synthesis activity in vitro. Their enzymatic activities were highest at pH 8-9, consistent with the hypothesis that DMA is synthesized in subcellular vesicles. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of each of the above DMAS genes is up-regulated under iron-deficient conditions in root tissue, and that of the genes OsDMAS1 and TaDMAS1 is up-regulated in shoot tissue. OsDMAS1 promoter-GUS analysis in iron-sufficient roots showed that its expression is restricted to cells participating in long distance transport and that it is highly up-regulated in the entire root under iron-deficient conditions. In shoot tissue, OsDMAS1 promoter drove expression in vascular bundles specifically under iron-deficient conditions.
16436304	Molecular characterization of four rice genes encoding ethylene-responsive transcriptional factors and their expressions in response to biotic and abiotic stress.	2006	J Plant Physiol	We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions. The OsBIERF1-4 proteins contain conserved ERF domains, but are categorized into different classes of the previously characterized ERF proteins based on their structural organizations. OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF2 belong to Classes I and II, respectively; while OsBIRERF1 and OsBIERF4 are members of Class IV. OsBIERF3 could bind specifically to the GCC box sequence and was targeted to nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermis cells. Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsBIERF1 and OsBIERF3 were activated in an incompatible interaction but not in compatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding. These results suggest that OsBIERF proteins may participate in different signaling pathways that mediate disease resistance response and stress responses to abiotic factors.
16977424	A rice dehydration-inducible SNF1-related protein kinase 2 phosphorylates an abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor and associates with ABA signaling.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	By a differential cDNA screening technique, we have isolated a dehydration-inducible gene (designated OSRK1) that encodes a 41.8 kD protein kinase of SnRK2 family from Oryza sativa. The OSRK1 transcript level was undetectable in vegetative tissues, but significantly increased by hyperosmotic stress and Abscisic acid (ABA). To determine its biochemical properties, we expressed and isolated OSRK1 and its mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. In vitro kinase assay showed that OSRK1 can phosphorylate itself and generic substrates as well. Interestingly, OSRK1 showed strong substrate preference for rice bZIP transcription factors and uncommon cofactor requirement for Mn(2+) over Mg(2+). By deletion of C-terminus 73 amino acids or mutations of Ser-158 and Thr-159 to aspartic acids (Asp) in the activation loop, the activity of OSRK1 was dramatically decreased. OSRK1 can transphosphorylate the inactive deletion protein. A rice family of abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) binding factor, OREB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by OSRK1 at multiple sites of different functional domains. MALDI-TOF analysis identified a phosphorylation site at Ser44 of OREB1 and mutation of the residue greatly decreased the substrate specificity for OSRK1. The recognition motif for OSRK1, RQSS is highly similar to the consensus substrate sequence of AMPK/SNF1 kinase family. We further showed that OSRK1 interacts with OREB1 in a yeast two-hybrid system and co-localized to nuclei by transient expression analysis of GFP-fused protein in onion epidermis. Finally, ectopic expression of OSRK1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a reduced sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and root elongation. These findings suggest that OSRK1 is associated with ABA signaling, possibly through the phosphorylation of ABF family in vivo. The interaction between SnRK2 family kinases and ABF transcription factors may constitute an important part of cross-talk mechanism in the stress signaling networks in plants.
17400897	Rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase1 is essential for pollen callose deposition and its cosuppression results in a new type of thermosensitive genic male sterility.	2007	Plant Cell	UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) catalyzes the reversible production of glucose-1-phosphate and UTP to UDP-glucose and pyrophosphate. The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains two homologous UGPase genes, Ugp1 and Ugp2. We report a functional characterization of rice Ugp1, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development. Ugp1 silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility. Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development. More importantly, Ugp1-cosuppressing plants contained unprocessed intron-containing primary transcripts derived from transcription of the overexpression construct. These aberrant transcripts undergo temperature-sensitive splicing in florets, leading to a novel thermosensitive genic male sterility. Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Ugp1-silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted. Consequently, the PMCs began to degenerate at the early meiosis stage, eventually resulting in complete pollen collapse. In addition, the degeneration of the tapetum and middle layer was inhibited. These results demonstrate that rice Ugp1 is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development.
17388894	A CDC25 homologue from rice functions as an arsenate reductase.	2007	New Phytol	Enzymatic reduction of arsenate to arsenite is the first step in arsenate metabolism in all organisms studied. The rice genome contains two ACR2-like genes, OsACR2.1 and OsACR2.2, which may be involved in regulating arsenic metabolism in rice. Here, we cloned both OsACR2 genes and expressed them in an Escherichia coli strain in which the arsC gene was deleted and in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain with a disrupted ACR2 gene. OsACR2.1 complemented the arsenate hypersensitive phenotype of E. coli and yeast. OsACR2.2 showed much less ability to complement. The gene products were purified and demonstrated to reduce arsenate to arsenite in vitro, and both exhibited phosphatase activity. In agreement with the complementation results, OsACR2.1 exhibited higher reductase activity than OsACR2.2. Mutagenesis of cysteine residues in the putative active site HC(X)(5)R motif led to nearly complete loss of both phosphatase and arsenate reductase activities. In planta expression of OsACR2.1 increased dramatically after exposure to arsenate. OsACR2.2 was observed only in roots following arsenate exposure, and its expression was less than OsACR2.1.
17163879	The Rc and Rd genes are involved in proanthocyanidin synthesis in rice pericarp.	2007	Plant J	Different colors, such as purple, brown, red and white, occur in the pericarp of rice. Here, two genes affecting proanthocyanidin synthesis in red- and brown-colored rice were elucidated. Genetic segregation analysis suggested that the Rd and A loci are identical, and both encode dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR). The introduction of the DFR gene into an Rcrd mutant resulted in red-colored rice, which was brown in the original mutant, demonstrating that the Rd locus encodes the DFR protein. Accumulation of proanthocyanidins was observed in the transformants by the introduction of the Rd gene into the rice Rcrd line. Protein blot analysis showed that the DFR gene was translated in seeds with alternative translation initiation. A search for the Rc gene, which encodes a transacting regulatory factor, was conducted using available DNA markers and the Rice Genome Automated Annotation System program. Three candidate genes were identified and cloned from a rice RcRd line and subsequently introduced into a rice rcrd line. Brown-colored seeds were obtained from transgenic plants by the introduction of a gene containing the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, demonstrating that the Rc gene encodes a bHLH protein. Comparison of the Rc locus among rice accessions showed that a 14-bp deletion occurred only in the rc locus.
16990291	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated a pollen-preferential gene, RICE IMMATURE POLLEN 1 (RIP1), from a T-DNA insertional population of japonica rice that was trapped by a promoterless beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that the RIP1 transcript was abundant at the late stages of pollen development. Transgenic plants carrying a T-DNA insertion in the RIP1 gene displayed the phenotype of segregation distortion of the mutated rip1 gene. Moreover, rip1/rip1 homozygous progeny were not present. Reciprocal crosses between Rip1/rip1 heterozygous plants and the wild type showed that the rip1 allele could not be transmitted through the male. Microscopic analysis demonstrated that development in the rip1 pollen was delayed, starting at the early vacuolated stage. Close examination of that pollen by transmission electron microscopy also showed delayed formation of starch granules and the intine layer. In addition, development of the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, lipid bodies, plastids and endoplasmic reticulum was deferred in the mutant pollen. Under in vitro conditions, germination of this mutant pollen did not occur, whereas the rate for wild-type pollen was >90%. These results indicate that RIP1 is necessary for pollen maturation and germination. This gene encodes a protein that shares significant homology with a group of proteins containing five WD40 repeat sequences. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-RIP1 fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. Therefore, RIP1 is probably a nuclear protein that may form a functional complex with other proteins and carry out essential cellular and developmental roles during the late stage of pollen formation.
16720649	ACT domain repeat protein 7, ACR7, interacts with a chaperone HSP18.0-CII in rice nuclei.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	The regulatory ACT domains serve as amino acid-binding sites in some amino acid metabolic enzymes and transcriptional regulators in bacteria. To elucidate the molecular roles of the glutamine (Gln)-sensing system in nitrogen (N) metabolism in plants, we isolated six genes encoding ACT domain repeat proteins (ACR1, and ACR5-ACR9) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) using genomic information on the primary structure composed of four copies of the domain homologous to those of bacterial Gln sensor GLND. Since expression of ACR7 was the most abundant of the six ACR orthologous genes, we focused on this ACR in the current study. Gene products of ACR7 were most abundant in young developing leaf blades of rice, and ACR7 protein is specifically localized in the nucleus of the parenchyma cells of phloem and xylem in the vascular bundles. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a small heat stress protein (HSP18.0-CII) as a protein interacting with ACR7. Transient expression analysis of HSP18.0-CII:sGFP in cultured rice cells, followed by co-immunoprecipitation, suggests that the nuclear ACR7 indeed interacted with nucleocytoplasmic HSP18.0-CII in vivo. The potential ability of nuclear protein ACR7 to bind Gln and the possibility of the protein acting as a Gln sensor in rice leaves is discussed.
17293362	Overexpression of a type-A response regulator alters rice morphology and cytokinin metabolism.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Genome-wide analyses of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytokinin (CK)-responsive genes using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) rice genome array were conducted to define the spectrum of genes subject to regulation by CK in monocotyledonous plants. Application of trans-zeatin modulated the expression of a wide variety of genes including those involved in hormone signaling and metabolism, transcriptional regulation, macronutrient transport and protein synthesis. To understand further the function of CK in rice plants, we examined the effects of in planta manipulation of a putative CK signaling factor on morphology, CK metabolism and expression of CK-responsive genes. Overexpression of the CK-inducible type-A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6-ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles. Increased content of trans-zeatin-type CKs in OsRR6-ox lines indicates that homeostatic control of CK levels is regulated by OsRR6 signaling. Expression of genes encoding CK oxidase/dehydrogenase decreased in OsRR6-ox plants, possibly accounting for elevated CK levels in transgenic lines. Expression of a number of stress response genes was also altered in OsRR6-ox plants.
16919402	Identification and characterization of cytokinin-signalling gene families in rice.	2006	Gene	We identified four histidine kinase (HK) genes of a cytokinin receptor family, two histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt) genes, thirteen A-type response regulator (RR) genes and six B-type RR genes in the rice genome. The HK genes (OHK2, OHK3, OHK4 and OHK5 for Oryza sativa HK), the HPt genes (OHP1 and OHP2 for O. sativa HPt) and the B-type RR genes (ORR1, ORR2, ORR3, ORR4 and ORR6 for O. sativa RR) except one (ORR5) showed expression in various organs. ORR5 was expressed in callus and flower. Three A-type RR genes (OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10 for O. sativa RR) showed cytokinin-induced expression, and three (OsRR8, OsRR12 and OsRR13) showed expression in flower. We also identified two other genes named OHK1 and CHARK (CHASE domain Receptor-like serine/threonine Kinase). OHK1 encodes an HK similar to Arabidopsis CKI1, which is involved in female gametophyte development. CHARK encodes a protein with an extracellular cytokinin-perceiving CHASE domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain which are connected with a single transmembrane domain. The presence of all four gene families and CHARK in the rice genome suggests that a cytokinin signal is transduced by the phosphotransfer mechanism as is the case in Arabidopsis, and that rice may have an additional novel signalling pathway involving serine/threonine phosphorylation.
16906405	Characterization of expressed Pgip genes in rice and wheat reveals similar extent of sequence variation to dicot PGIPs and identifies an active PGIP lacking an entire LRR repeat.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. A number of PGIPs have been characterized from dicot species, whereas only a few data are available from monocots. Database searches and genome-specific cloning strategies allowed the identification of four rice (Oryza sativa L.) and two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Pgip genes. The rice Pgip genes (Ospgip1, Ospgip2, Ospgip3 and Ospgip4) are distributed over a 30 kbp region of the short arm of chromosome 5, whereas the wheat Pgip genes, Tapgip1 and Tapgip2, are localized on the short arm of chromosome 7B and 7D, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences show the typical LRR modular organization and a conserved distribution of the eight cysteines at the N- and C-terminal regions. Sequence comparison suggests that monocot and dicot PGIPs form two separate clusters sharing about 40% identity and shows that this value is close to the extent of variability observed within each cluster. Gene-specific RT-PCR and biochemical analyses demonstrate that both Ospgips and Tapgips are expressed in the whole plant or in a tissue-specific manner, and that OsPGIP1, lacking an entire LRR repeat, is an active inhibitor of fungal polygalacturonases. This last finding can contribute to define the molecular features of PG-PGIP interactions and highlights that the genetic events that can generate variability at the Pgip locus are not only limited to substitutions or small insertions/deletions, as so far reported, but can also involve variation in the number of LRRs.
17376611	Characterization of a lipoate-protein ligase A gene of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Gene	Lipoic acid is an essential disulfide cofactor required for the lipoate-dependent enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and glycine cleavage enzymes that function in key metabolic pathways in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Lipoic acid is covalently bound to lipoate-dependent enzymes by lipoate-protein ligase or lipoate transferase. Here, we characterized a lipoyl-protein ligase A (OsLPLA) gene of rice. The OsLPLA gene, which encoded 270 amino acids, was located on an approximately 21 Mb of chromosome 8 on the physical map of Oryza sativa Japonica type. OsLPLA transcripts were abundantly expressed in leaves and developing seeds. The OsLPLA gene functionally complemented an Escherichia coli lplA null mutant. Furthermore, the protein expressed from the OsLPLA gene in an E. coli lplA mutant successfully transferred exogenous lipoate to lipoate-dependent enzymes, including the E2 subunits of the PDH, the E2 subunit of KGDH and the H-protein of glycine decarboxylase, confirming that rice OsLPLA successfully catalyzed covalent attachment of lipoate onto lipoate-dependent enzymes.
17218330	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are negative regulators of MAPKs. In dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis and tobacco, MKPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and microtubule organization. However, little is known about the role of MKPs in monocotyledons such as rice. Database searches identified five putative MKPs in rice. We investigated their expression in response to wounding, and found that the expression of OsMKP1 is rapidly induced by wounding. In this study, we functionally characterized the involvement of OsMKP1 in wound responses. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsMKP1 shows strong similarity to Arabidopsis AtMKP1 and tobacco NtMKP1. Moreover, OsMKP1 bound calmodulin in a manner similar to NtMKP1. To determine the biological function of OsMKP1, we obtained osmkp1, a loss-of-function mutant, in which retrotransposon Tos17 was inserted in the second exon of OsMKP1. Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi-dwarf phenotype. Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi-dwarf phenotype of osmkp1. Activities of two stress-responsive MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, in osmkp1 were higher than those in the wild type both before and after wounding. Microarray analysis identified 13 up-regulated and eight down-regulated genes in osmkp1. Among the up-regulated genes, the expression of five genes showed clear responses to wounding, indicating that wound responses are constitutively activated in osmkp1. These results suggest that OsMKP1 is involved in the negative regulation of rice wound responses.
17148693	Two novel nuclear genes, OsSIG5 and OsSIG6, encoding potential plastid sigma factors of RNA polymerase in rice: tissue-specific and light-responsive gene expression.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Two novel nuclear genes, OsSIG5 and OsSIG6, encoding potential plastid sigma factors of RNA polymerase (RNAP) were identified in Oryza sativa. The deduced amino acid sequences contain conserved regions, regions 1.2-4.2, and a novel region A/B at the N-terminus. Tissue-specific and light-responsive transcripts of OsSIG5 and OsSIG6 were observed. The N-terminal region of OsSig5 conferred import of green fluorescent protein into the chloroplast. Specific transcripts of rice psbA were synthesized in vitro by reconstituted OsSig5-RNAP holoenzymes. These results indicated that OsSig5 is a plastid sigma factor. This is the first report of the Sig5-type sigma factor in crops.
17216230	Origin of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Planta	A critical evolutionary step during rice domestication was the elimination of seed shattering. Wild rice disperses seeds freely at maturity to guarantee the propagation, while cultivated rice retains seeds on the straws to make easy harvest and decrease the loss of production. The molecular basis for this key event during rice domestication remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors. SHA1 was mapped to a 5.5 kb genomic fragment, which contains a single open reading frame, using a backcrossed population between cultivated rice Teqing and an introgression line IL105 with the seed shattering habit derived from perennial common wild rice, YJCWR. The predicted amino acid sequence of SHA1 in YJCWR and IL105 is distinguished from that in eight domesticated rice cultivars, including Teqing, by only a single amino acid substitution (K79N) caused by a single nucleotide change (g237t). Further sequence verification on the g237t mutation site revealed that the g237t mutation is present in all the domesticated rice cultivars, including 92 indica and 108 japonica cultivars, but not in any of the 24 wild rice accessions examined. Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in SHA1 accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity. In addition, our data support the theory that the non-shattering trait selection during rice domestication occurred prior to the indica-japonica differentiation in rice evolutionary history.
17364810	Cloning and sequence analysis of germin-like protein gene 2 promoter from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica.	2007	DNA Seq	Germin and germin-like proteins (GLPs) are water soluble extracellular proteins reportedly expressed in response to some environmental and developmental signals. Some enzymatic activities have also been associated with germin/GLPs. However, their role in overall metabolism has not been fully understood. Significant insight into their function may also be gained by analysis of their promoter. During this study, about 1107 bp 5'region of OsRGLP2 gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequence analysis by BLAST showed that this promoter sequence has five common regions (CR1-CR5) of different sizes, which are repeated at 3-6 other locations in 30 kb region in which this gene driven by its promoter is located. Interestingly, all the genes driven by promoter harboring these common regions are GLPs/putative germins. Analysis of these common regions located on OsRGLP2 indicated presence of many elements including those for light responsiveness, dehydration and dark induced senescence, stresses (pathogen and salt), plant growth regulators, pollen specific expression and elements related to seed storage proteins. Analysis of the 30 kb germin/GLP clustered region by GenScan detected each gene to have a putative 40 bp promoter which contains TATA box and Dof factor which turned out to be a part of CR2.
17022177	Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection.	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Many studies in dicotyledonous plants have shown that jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, are important signal molecules involved in induced resistance to pathogen infection and insect herbivory. However, very little genetic and molecular evidence is available to demonstrate their role in host defense response of rice and other economically important monocot plants. In this study, we have shown that exogenous application of JA was able to activate defense gene expression and local induced resistance in rice seedlings against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen-inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis. Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting. The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants. Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M. grisea infection. Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection. These transgenic lines also exhibited enhanced activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR3, and PR5 and increased resistance to M. grisea infection. Our results suggest that JA plays a significant role in PR gene induction and blast resistance in rice plants.
17327258	Two alternatively spliced transcripts generated from OsMUS81, a rice homolog of yeast MUS81, are up-regulated by DNA-damaging treatments.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	OsMUS81, a rice homolog of the yeast MUS81 endonuclease gene, produced two alternative transcripts, OsMUS81alpha and OsMUS81beta. OsMus81alpha contained a Helix-hairpin-Helix (HhH) motif at the N- and C-termini, and a conserved XPF-like motif in the center, while the OsMus81beta isoform lacked the second HhH motif by alternative splicing of a cryptic intron generating a truncated protein. The two transcripts were induced after DNA-damaging treatments such as high intensity light, UV-C and gamma-radiation. The yeast two-hybrid assay detected a strong interaction between OsMus81 and OsRad54 recombinational repair proteins. These findings suggest that OsMus81 functions in maintaining genome integrity through homologous recombination.
16956633	Uncovering the complex metabolic network underlying diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice and other cereal crop plants.	2006	Phytochemistry	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple food crop and serves as a model cereal crop plant for scientific study. Phytochemical investigations of the agronomically devastating rice blast disease have identified a number of rice phytoalexins exhibiting significant direct anti-fungal activity against the causative agent, Magneporthe grisea. Current evidence strongly indicates that these phytoalexins, largely a family of labdane-related diterpenoids, are important as general antibiotics, and that similar phytoalexins are produced more broadly throughout the cereal crop family. From the extensive sequence information available for rice it has been possible to functionally identify the genes for the enzymes catalyzing the two consecutive cyclization reactions that initiate biosynthesis of these labdane-related diterpenoid phytoalexins. This has led to several insights into the underlying evolution of diterpene biosynthesis throughout the cereal crop family. The hydrocarbon olefins resulting from cyclization must be further elaborated to form bioactive natural products and, because not much is currently known, necessarily speculative biosynthetic pathways for these processes are presented. Given the significant antibiotic activity of the labdane-related diterpenoid phytoalexins from rice, and the presence of similar secondary metabolism throughout the cereal crop plant family, study of this type of biosynthesis will continue to be an area of active investigation.
17205969	Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	A rapid decrease of the plant hormone ABA under submergence is thought to be a prerequisite for the enhanced elongation of submerged shoots of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report that the level of phaseic acid (PA), an oxidized form of ABA, increased with decreasing ABA level during submergence. The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (OsABA8ox1, -2 and -3) in rice. The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing OsABA8ox1. OsABA8ox1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in onion cells was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA level of OsABA8ox1, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (OsZEP and OsNCEDs) decreased after 1-2 h of submergence. Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of OsABA8ox1, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of OsABA8ox1 expression under submergence. The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with OsABA8ox1 expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment. Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of OsABA8ox1 and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA.
16369540	Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice.	2006	Nat Biotechnol	New cultivars with very erect leaves, which increase light capture for photosynthesis and nitrogen storage for grain filling, may have increased grain yields. Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer. Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Therefore, despite the central role of brassinosteroids in plant growth and development, mutation of OsDWARF4 alone causes only limited defects in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and plant morphology. These results suggest that regulated genetic modulation of brassinosteroid biosynthesis can improve crops without the negative environmental effects of fertilizers.
17216479	Over-expression of rice OsAGO7 gene induces upward curling of the leaf blade that enhanced erect-leaf habit.	2007	Planta	High-yield cultivars are characterized by erect leaf canopies that optimize photosynthesis and thus favor increased biomass. Upward curling of the leaf blade (called rolled leaf) can result in enhanced erect-leaf habit, increase erect duration and promote an overall erect leaf canopy. The rice mutant R05, induced through transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion, had the rolled-leaf trait. The leaves in the wild type demonstrated natural drooping tendencies, resulting in decreasing leaf erection indices (LEIs) during senescence at the 20th day after flowering. Conversely, LEIs of the leaves in R05 remained high, even 20-day post-flowering. We applied T-DNA tagging and isolated a rolled-leaf gene from rice which, when over-expressed, could induce upward curling of the leaf blade. This gene encodes for a protein of 1,048 amino acids including the PAZ and PIWI conserved domains, belonging to the Argonaute (AGO) family. There are at least 18 members of the AGO family in rice. According to high-sequence conservation, the rolled-leaf gene in rice could be orthologous to the Arabidopsis ZIP/Ago7 gene, so we called it OsAGO7. These results provide a possible opportunity for implementing OsAGO7 gene in crop improvement.
17082902	Identification and characterization of two rice autophagy associated genes, OsAtg8 and OsAtg4.	2006	Mol Biol Rep	Autophagy is an intracellular process for vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic components. The molecular machinery responsible for yeast and mammalian autophagy has begun to be elucidated at the cellular level. A genome-wide search revealed significant conservation among autophagy genes in yeast and Arabidopsis. Up till now, however, there is no report about rice autophagy associated genes. Here we cloned OsAtg8 and OsAtg4 from Oryza sativa and detected their expression patterns in various tissues. Immunoblotting analysis showed that carboxyl terminus of OsAtg8 can be cleaved in yeast cell. Mutation analysis revealed that the conserved Gly117 residue of OsAtg8 was essential for its characteristic C-terminal cleavage as similar to that found in mammalian and yeast Atg8. We further proved that OsAtg8 interacted with OsAtg4, and this interaction was not affected by the conserved Gly117 mutation. Our results demonstrate that Atg8 conjugation pathway is conserved in rice and may play important roles in rice autophagy.
17056620	Conservation and diversification of meristem maintenance mechanism in Oryza sativa: Function of the FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 gene.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	To elucidate the genetic mechanism that regulates meristem maintenance in monocots, here we have examined the function of the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) in Oryza sativa (rice). Mutations in FON2 cause enlargement of the floral meristem, resulting in an increase in the number of floral organs, although the vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal. Molecular cloning reveals that FON2 encodes a small secreted protein, containing a CLE domain, that is closely related to CLAVATA3 in Arabidopsis thaliana. FON2 transcripts are localized at the apical region in all meristems in the aerial parts of rice plants, showing an expression pattern similar to that of Arabidopsis CLV3. Constitutive expression of FON2 causes a reduction in the number of floral organs and flowers, suggesting that both the flower and inflorescence meristems are reduced in size. This action of FON2 requires the function of FON1, an ortholog of CLV1. Constitutive expression of FON2 also causes premature termination of the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis, a phenotype similar to that caused by constitutive expression of CLV3. Together with our previous study of FON1, these results clearly indicate that the FON1-FON2 system in rice corresponds to the CLV signaling system in Arabidopsis and suggest that the negative regulation of stem cell identity by these systems may be principally conserved in a wide range of plants within the Angiosperms. In addition, we propose a model of the genetic regulation of meristem maintenance in rice that includes an alternative pathway independent of FON2-FON1.
16971692	Evidence for transit peptide acquisition through duplication and subsequent frameshift mutation of a preexisting protein gene in rice.	2006	Mol Biol Evol	Many proteins synthesized in the cytosol are delivered to their appropriate compartments in the cell by specific targeting signals. Here, we provide new insight into the generation of the chloroplast-targeting signal (called the transit peptide) in rice. First, we identified the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L13 (mt rpl13) gene on chromosome 5. Downstream of the gene, we identified a DNA fragment of 266 bp: a segment within a duplication of mt rpl13. The duplicated region was transcribed and found to encode an open reading frame (ORF) of 160 amino acids (aa) (orf160). The orf160 gene comprises C-terminal 60 aa derived from the mt rpl13 gene and N-terminal 100 aa derived from another duplicated fragment of a pentatricopeptide repeat (ppr)564 gene that encodes 564 aa with ppr motifs on chromosome 1. Examination of the localization of the ORF160 protein tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that it is targeted to the chloroplasts. As such, ORF160 clearly contains a transit peptide. Interestingly, this was translated from the alternative reading frame of the duplicated fragment of ppr564. To confirm this, the reading frame of the ppr564 gene was shifted according to that of the orf160 gene, and the frameshifted ppr564 sequence was fused to the gene for GFP. The expressed GFP-fused protein was also located in the chloroplasts. These results provide clear evidence for the generation of the transit peptide through duplication and subsequent frameshifting of a reading frame of a preexisting protein gene. We also demonstrate the importance of sequence redundancy and frameshift mutation in this evolutionary process.
17172358	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance.	2006	Plant Cell	XA21 is a receptor-like kinase protein in rice (Oryza sativa) that confers gene-for-gene resistance to specific races of the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase. The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays. XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively. Transgenic plants with reduced expression of the Xb3 gene are compromised in resistance to the avirulent race of X. oryzae pv oryzae. Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein. These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance.
16896530	Molecular cloning and differential expression of an gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase gene, OsGABA-T, in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with blast fungus.	2006	J Plant Res	gamma-Aminobutyrate transaminase (GABA-T) catalyzes the conversion of GABA to succinic semialdehyde. Using differential display PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length GABA-T cDNA (OsGABA-T) was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa) leaves infected with an incompatible race of Magnaporthe grisea. The deduced amino acid sequence comprises 483 amino acid residues and shares 85-69% identity with GABA-T sequences from other plants. OsGABA-T expression is induced by blast fungus infection, mechanical wounding and ultraviolet radiation in rice leaves and is not detected in normal rice organs. This gene is also induced by defense signal molecules such as salicylic acid and abscisic acid, but not by jasmonic acid. Our data suggest that OsGABA-T (GABA shunt) may play a role in restricting the levels of cell death during the host-pathogen interaction.
16932879	Xa3, conferring resistance for rice bacterial blight and encoding a receptor kinase-like protein, is the same as Xa26.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background. Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance. Xa26 belongs to a clustered multigene family encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like proteins. To characterize Xa3, we fine mapped it using a population segregating for only one resistance gene and markers developed from Xa26 family. Genetic analysis showed that Xa3 co-segregated with the marker of Xa26 gene and segregated from the markers of other members of Xa26 family. DNA fingerprinting revealed that rice line IRBB3 carrying Xa3 had the same copy numbers of Xa26 family members as rice line Minghui 63 carrying Xa26. Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions. These results suggest that Xa3 and Xa26 is the same gene. We name it Xa3/Xa26 to indicate the relationship between the two gene symbols. The putative encoding products of Xa3/Xa26 and its susceptible allele xa3/xa26 shared 92% sequence identity. The sequence difference occurred in the LRR domains, specifically at the solvent-exposed amino acid residues, might be the major cause that differentiates the resistant and susceptible proteins.
17022939	Characterization of genes encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in ethylene-induced stem growth of deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Ethylene and submergence enhance stem elongation of deepwater rice, at least in part, by reducing in the internode the endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) content and increasing the level of gibberellin A1 (GA1). We cloned and characterized the CYP707A5 and CYP707A6 genes, which encode putative ABA 8'-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ABA. Expression of CYP707A5 was upregulated significantly by ethylene treatment, whereas that of CYP707A6 was not altered. Recombinant proteins from both genes expressed in yeast cells showed activity of ABA 8'-hydroxylase. This finding indicates that CYP707A5 may play a role in ABA catabolism during submergence- or ethylene-induced stem elongation in deepwater rice. Taken together, these results provide links between the molecular mechanisms and physiological phenomena of submergence- and ethylene-induced stem elongation in deepwater rice.
17056618	A rice family 9 glycoside hydrolase isozyme with broad substrate specificity for hemicelluloses in type II cell walls.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	An auxin analog, 2,4-D, stimulates the activity of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (EGase) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The auxin-induced activity from three protein fractions was purified to homogeneity from primary root tissues (based on SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing after Coomassie brilliant blue staining). Amino acid sequencing indicated that the 20 N-terminal amino acid sequence of the three proteins was identical, suggesting that these proteins may be cognates of one EGase gene. An internal amino acid sequence of the the rice EGase (LVGGYYDAGDNVK) revealed that this enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GHF9). The major isoform of this rice GHF9 [molecular weight based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS): 51,216, isoelectric point (pI): 5.5] specifically hydrolyzed 1,4-beta-glycosyl linkages of carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulose, phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose, 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan, arabinoxylan, xylan, glucomannan, cellooligosaccharides [with a degree of polymerization (DP) >3] and 1,4-beta-xylohexaose, indicating a broader substrate range compared with those of other characterized GHF9 enzymes or EGases from higher plants. Hydrolytic products of two major hemicellulosic polysaccharides in type II cell walls treated with the purified enzyme were profiled using high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The results suggested that endolytic attack by rice EGase is not restricted to either the cellulose-like domain of 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan or the unsubstituted 1,4-beta-xylosyl backbone of arabinoxylan, but results in the release of smaller oligosaccharides (DP <6) from graminaceous hemicelluloses. The comparatively broader substrate range of this EGase with respect to beta-1,4-glycan backbones (glucose and xylose) may partly reflect different roles of gramineous and non-gramineous GHF9 enzymes.
17056619	Carbohydrate-binding module of a rice endo-beta-1,4-glycanase, OsCel9A, expressed in auxin-induced lateral root primordia, is post-translationally truncated.	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	We report the cloning of a glycoside hydrolase family (GHF) 9 gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Sasanishiki), OsCel9A, corresponding to the auxin-induced 51 kDa endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (EGase). This enzyme reveals a broad substrate specificity with respect to sugar backbones (glucose and xylose) in beta-1,4-glycans of type II cell wall. OsCel9A encodes a 640 amino acid polypeptide and is an ortholog of TomCel8, a tomato EGase containing a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 2 sequence at its C-terminus. The expression of four rice EGase genes including OsCel9A showed different patterns of organ specificity and responses to auxin. OsCel9A was preferentially expressed during the initiation of lateral roots or subcultured root calli, but was hardly expressed during auxin-induced coleoptile elongation or in seed calli, in contrast to OsCel9D, a KORRIGAN (KOR) homolog. In situ localization of OsCel9A transcripts demonstrated that its expression was specifically up-regulated in lateral root primordia (LRP). Northern blotting analysis showed the presence of a single product of OsCel9A. In contrast, both mass spectrometric analyses of peptide fragments from purified 51 kDa EGase proteins and immunogel blot analysis of EGase proteins in root extracts using two antibodies against internal peptide sequences of OsCel9A revealed that the entire CBM2 region was post-translationally truncated from the 67 kDa nascent protein to generate 51 kDa EGase isoforms. Analyses of auxin concentration and time course dependence of accumulation of two EGase isoforms suggested that the translation and post-translational CBM2 truncation of the OsCel9A gene may participate in lateral root development.
16915519	Rice Chlorina-1 and Chlorina-9 encode ChlD and ChlI subunits of Mg-chelatase, a key enzyme for chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a green color due to the accumulation of chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts. Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (Mg-chelatase) comprises three subunits (ChlH, ChlD and ChlI) and catalyzes the insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX, the last common intermediate precursor in both chlorophyll and heme biosyntheses, to produce Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto). Chlorophyll deficiency in higher plants results in chlorina (yellowish-green) phenotype. To date, 10 chlorina (chl) mutants have been isolated in rice, but the corresponding genes have not yet been identified. Rice Chl1 and Chl9 genes were mapped to chromosome 3 and isolated by map-based cloning. A missense mutation occurred in a highly conserved amino acid of ChlD in the chl1 mutant and ChlI in the chl9 mutant. Ultrastructural analyses have revealed that the grana are poorly stacked, resulting in the underdevelopment of chloroplasts. In the seedlings fed with aminolevulinate-dipyridyl in darkness, MgProto levels in the chl1 and chl9 mutants decreased up to 25% and 31% of that in wild-type, respectively, indicating that the Mg-chelatase activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in chlorophyll synthesis. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis indicated that the nuclear genes encoding the three subunits of Mg-chelatase and LhcpII in chl1 mutant are expressed about 2-fold higher than those in WT, but are not altered in the chl9 mutant. This result indicates that the ChlD subunit participates in negative feedback regulation of plastid-to-nucleus in the expression of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins, but not the ChlI subunit.
17073304	The eight amino-acid differences within three leucine-rich repeats between Pi2 and Piz-t resistance proteins determine the resistance specificity to Magnaporthe grisea.	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The rice blast resistance (R) genes Pi2 and Piz-t confer broad-spectrum resistance against different sets of Magnaporthe grisea isolates. We first identified the Pi2 gene using a map-based cloning strategy. The Pi2 gene is a member of a gene cluster comprising nine gene members (named Nbs1-Pi2 to Nbs9-Pi2) and encodes a protein with a nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Fine genetic mapping, molecular characterization of the Pi2 susceptible mutants, and complementation tests indicated that Nbs4-Pi2 is the Pi2 gene. The Piz-t gene, a Pi2 allele in the rice cultivar Toride 1, was isolated based on the Pi2 sequence information. Complementation tests confirmed that the family member Nbs4-Piz-t is Piz-t. Sequence comparison revealed that only eight amino-acid changes, which are confined within three consecutive LRR, differentiate Piz-t from Pi2. Of the eight variants, only one locates within the xxLxLxx motif. A reciprocal exchange of the single amino acid between Pi2 and Piz-t did not convert the resistance specificity to each other but, rather, abolished the function of both resistance proteins. These results indicate that the single amino acid in the xxLxLxx motif may be critical for maintaining the recognition surface of Pi2 and Piz-t to their respective avirulence proteins.
16463105	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	A dwarf mutant glu was identified from screening of T-DNA tagged rice population. Genetic analysis of the T1 generation of glu revealed that a segregation ratio of wild-type:dwarf phenotype was 3:1, suggesting that the mutated phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear locus. The mutated gene OsGLU1, identified by Tail-PCR, encodes a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase, which is highly conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants. Transgenic glu mutants harboring the OsGLU1 gene complemented the mutation and displayed the wild-type phenotype. In addition, OsGLU1 RNAi plants showed similar phenotype as the glu mutant has. These results indicate that OsGLU1 plays important roles in plant cell growth. Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression. In rice genome, endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanases form a multiple gene family with 15 members, and each may have a distinct expression pattern in different organs. These results indicate that endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanases may play diverse roles in growth and developmental process of rice plants.
10527416	Differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes during seedling development under anoxia.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	The unique capability of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings to grow under anoxic conditions may result in part from their ability to express alpha-amylase and maintain the supply of sugar needed for energy metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that under aerobic conditions the Amy1 and Amy2 subfamily genes are regulated primarily by phytohormones while the Amy3 subfamily genes are induced during sugar starvation. The expression patterns for these alpha-amylase genes were considerably different in anoxic vs. aerobic rice seedlings. The level of total alpha-amylase mRNA under anoxic conditions was decreased in aleurone layers while it increased in the embryo. Anoxic conditions greatly diminished the expression of the Amy1A gene in aleurone. Conversely, expression of many Amy3 subfamily genes was up-regulated and prolonged in embryo tissues under anoxic conditions.
9869417	Longevity of 5-azacytidine-mediated gene expression and re-establishment of silencing in transgenic rice.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	Epigenetic silencing of a bialaphos resistance (bar) gene in R1 progeny of a transgenic rice line was found to be meiotically stable since selfed (R2) progeny were also susceptible and the bar locus highly methylated. A high proportion of R2 seedlings germinated in the presence of 5-azacytidine (AzaC) were herbicide-resistant and also contained at least one unmethylated copy of the bar gene, further establishing the relationship between silencing and methylation. Restored bar gene expression was typically maintained for 20-50 days, but eventual methylation and silencing of the bar locus underscores the ability of the recipient genome to recognize and inactivate intrusive DNA.
16927205	Map-based cloning of a novel rice cytochrome P450 gene CYP81A6 that confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Development of hybrid rice has greatly contributed to increased yields during the past three decades. Two bentazon-lethal mutants 8077S and Norin8m are being utilized in developing new hybrid rice systems. When the male sterile lines are developed in such a mutant background, the problem of F1 seed contamination by self-seeds from the sterile lines can be solved by spraying bentazon at seedling stage. We first determined the sensitivity of the mutant plants to bentazon. Both mutants showed symptoms to bentazon starting from 100 mg/l, which was about 60-fold, lower than the sensitivity threshold of their wild-type controls. In addition, both mutants were sensitive to sulfonylurea-type herbicides. The locus for the mutant phenotype is bel for 8077S and bsl for Norin8m. Tests showed that the two loci are allelic to each other. The two genes were cloned by map-based cloning. Interestingly, both mutant alleles had a single-base deletion, which was confirmed by PCR-RFLP. The two loci are renamed bel ( a ) (for bel) and bel ( b ) (for bsl). The wild-type Bel gene encodes a novel cytochrome P450 monooxgenase, named CYP81A6. Analysis of the mutant protein sequence also revealed the reason for bel ( a ) being slightly tolerant than bel ( b ). Introduction of the wild-type Bel gene rescued the bentazon- and sulfonylurea-sensitive phenotype of bel ( a ) mutant. On the other hand, expression of antisense Bel in W6154S induced a mutant phenotype. Based on these results we conclude that the novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6 encoded by Bel confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides.
15907692	The rice (Oryza sativa) blast lesion mimic mutant, blm, may confer resistance to blast pathogens by triggering multiple defense-associated signaling pathways.	2005	Plant Physiol Biochem	Here we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast lesion mimic (blm) mutant, identified previously in an N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized population of the cultivar Hwacheong (wild type). The rice blm displayed spontaneous necrotic lesion formation on the leaves during development under long-day condition and temperature shift from 28 to 24 degrees C in the absence of obvious stress/disease, and provided us with a highly reproducible and convenient experimental system in the growth chamber to study blm. The blm phenotype resembled to the cell death of hypersensitive reaction (HR), and subsequent, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) revealed induction of many leaf proteins; prominent among them were the three pathogenesis-related (PR) marker proteins of class 5 (one spot) and 10 (two spots). Interestingly, the rice blm manifested HR against all races tested of the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), providing high resistance in a non-race specific manner. It was also observed that blm was highly resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment. Using 2-DGE immunoblotting, we identified the presence of 4 new spots cross-reacting with a superoxide dismutase (SOD) antibody, only in blm, suggesting the expression of potentially new SOD protein (isoforms) during lesion formation. In the leaves of blm, autofluorescent compounds accumulated in and around the site of lesion progression. Moreover, enhanced levels of two major rice phytoalexins, sakuranetin and momilactone A were also observed in the leaves of blm. These results indicate that blm confers broad-spectrum resistance to multiple pathogens, and so, it could be hypothesized that the BLM gene product may control the HR-like cell death and its associated multiple defense signaling pathways, as evidenced by induction of known hallmark features (proteins/metabolites) linked with the defense responses, in rice.
16240104	High-resolution mapping of a new brown planthopper (BPH) resistance gene, Bph18(t), and marker-assisted selection for BPH resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Brown planthopper (BPH) is a destructive insect pest of rice in Asia. Identification and the incorporation of new BPH resistance genes into modern rice cultivars are important breeding strategies to control the damage caused by new biotypes of BPH. In this study, a major resistance gene, Bph18(t), has been identified in an introgression line (IR65482-7-216-1-2) that has inherited the gene from the wild species Oryza australiensis. Genetic analysis revealed the dominant nature of the Bph18(t) gene and identified it as non-allelic to another gene, Bph10 that was earlier introgressed from O. australiensis. After linkage analysis using MapMaker followed by single-locus ANOVA on quantitatively expressed resistance levels of the progenies from an F2 mapping population identified with marker allele types, the Bph18(t) gene was initially located on the subterminal region of the long arm of chromosome 12 flanked by the SSR marker RM463 and the STS marker S15552. The corresponding physical region was identified in the Nipponbare genome pseudomolecule 3 through electronic chromosome landing (e-landing), in which 15 BAC clones covered 1.612 Mb. Eleven DNA markers tagging the BAC clones were used to construct a high-resolution genetic map of the target region. The Bph18(t) locus was further localized within a 0.843-Mb physical interval that includes three BAC clones between the markers R10289S and RM6869 by means of single-locus ANOVA of resistance levels of mapping population and marker-gene association analysis on 86 susceptible F2 progenies based on six time-point phenotyping. Using gene annotation information of TIGR, a putative resistance gene was identified in the BAC clone OSJNBa0028L05 and the sequence information was used to generate STS marker 7312.T4A. The marker allele of 1,078 bp completely co-segregated with the BPH resistance phenotype. STS marker 7312.T4A was validated using BC2F2 progenies derived from two temperate japonica backgrounds. Some 97 resistant BC2F2 individuals out of 433 screened completely co-segregated with the resistance-specific marker allele (1,078 bp) in either homozygous or heterozygous state. This further confirmed a major gene-controlled resistance to the BPH biotype of Korea. Identification of Bph18(t) enlarges the BPH resistance gene pool to help develop improved rice cultivars, and the PCR marker (7312.T4A) for the Bph18(t) gene should be readily applicable for marker-assisted selection (MAS).
16395578	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a rice brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) resistance gene bph19(t).	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a resistance gene against brown planthopper (BPH) biotype 2 in rice was performed using two F(2) populations derived from two crosses between a resistant indica cultivar (cv.), AS20-1, and two susceptible japonica cvs., Aichi Asahi and Lijiangxintuanheigu. Insect resistance was evaluated using F(1) plants and the two F(2) populations. The results showed that a single recessive gene, tentatively designated as bph19(t), conditioned the resistance in AS20-1. A linkage analysis, mainly employing microsatellite markers, was carried out in the two F(2) populations through bulked segregant analysis and recessive class analysis (RCA), in combination with bioinformatics analysis (BIA). The resistance gene locus bph19(t) was finely mapped to a region of about 1.0 cM on the short arm of chromosome 3, flanked by markers RM6308 and RM3134, where one known marker RM1022, and four new markers, b1, b2, b3 and b4, developed in the present study were co-segregating with the locus. To physically map this locus, the bph19(t)-linked markers were landed on bacterial artificial chromosome or P1 artificial chromosome clones of the reference cv., Nipponbare, released by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project. Sequence information of these clones was used to construct a physical map of the bph19(t) locus, in silico, by BIA. The bph19(t) locus was physically defined to an interval of about 60 kb. The detailed genetic and physical maps of the bph19(t) locus will facilitate marker-assisted gene pyramiding and cloning.
15994910	The Rice brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf2 mutant, defective in the rice homolog of Arabidopsis DIMINUTO/DWARF1, is rescued by the endogenously accumulated alternative bioactive brassinosteroid, dolichosterone.	2005	Plant Cell	We have identified a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutant, BR-deficient dwarf2 (brd2). The brd2 locus contains a single base deletion in the coding region of Dim/dwf1, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana DIMINUTO/DWARF1 (DIM/DWF1). Introduction of the wild-type Dim/dwf1 gene into brd2 restored the normal phenotype. Overproduction and repression of Dim/dwf1 resulted in contrasting phenotypes, with repressors mimicking the brd2 phenotype and overproducers having large stature with increased numbers of flowers and seeds. Although brd2 contains low levels of common 6-oxo-type BRs, the severity of the brd2 phenotype is much milder than brd1 mutants and most similar to d2 and d11, which show a semidwarf phenotype at the young seedling stage. Quantitative analysis suggested that in brd2, the 24-methylene BR biosynthesis pathway is activated and the uncommon BR, dolichosterone (DS), is produced. DS enhances the rice lamina joint bending angle, rescues the brd1 dwarf phenotype, and inhibits root elongation, indicating that DS is a bioactive BR in rice. Based on these observations, we discuss an alternative BR biosynthetic pathway that produces DS when Dim/dwf1 is defective.
9880342	Adventitious root growth and cell-cycle induction in deepwater rice	1999	Plant Physiol	Deepwater rice (Oryza sativa) is adapted to survive conditions of severe flooding over extended periods of time. During such periods adventitious roots develop to provide water, nutrients, and anchorage. In the present study the growth of adventitious roots was induced by treatment with ethylene but not auxin, cytokinin, or gibberellin. Root elongation was enhanced between 8 and 10 h after submergence. The population of cells in the S phase and expression of the S-phase-specific histone H3 gene increased within 4 to 6 h. Within 6 to 8 h the G2-phase population increased. Cell-cycle activation was accompanied by sequential induction of a cdc2-activating kinase homolog, R2, of two cdc2 genes, cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2, and of three cyclin genes, cycA1;3, cycB2;1, and cycB2;2, but only induction of the R2 gene expression preceded the induction of the S phase, possibly contributing to cell-cycle regulation in the G1 phase. Both cdc2 genes were expressed at slightly higher levels during DNA replication. Transcripts of the A-type cyclin accumulated during the S and G2 phases, and transcripts of the B-type cyclins accumulated during the G2 phase. Cyclin expression was induced at all nodes with a similar time course, suggesting that ethylene acts systemically and that root primordia respond to ethylene at an early developmental stage.
12913143	Hyperphosphorylation of a mitochondrial protein, prohibitin, is induced by calyculin A in a rice lesion-mimic mutant cdr1.	2003	Plant Physiol	The rice (Oryza sativa) lesion-mimic mutants, cell death and resistance (cdr), show spontaneous cell death on the entire leaf and exhibited significant resistance to the rice blast fungus. Our previous studies showed that CDR1 and CDR2 genes negatively regulated the phosphorylation steps leading to the activation of NADPH oxidase, which is associated with oxidative burst. To identify novel factors involved in the phosphorylation steps, the phosphorylation level of total proteins was compared between cdr mutants and wild type using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Here, we show that the phosphorylation level of four proteins in cdr1 was increased as compared with the wild type after calyculin A treatment. Partial amino acid sequences revealed that one of the four proteins is homologous to prohibitin (PHB), which has been shown to be associated with senescence and cell death and to function as a chaperone in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex in yeast and mammals. Analysis of green fluorescent protein fusions indicated that rice PHB (OsPHB1) was targeted to mitochondria as found in yeast and mammals, suggesting a possibility that PHB is involved in defense response and/or programmed cell death through the mitochondrial function.
15159627	Two rice GRAS family genes responsive to N -acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor are induced by phytoactive gibberellins: evidence for cross-talk between elicitor and gibberellin signaling in rice cells.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	In this study, we present data showing that two members of the GRAS family of genes from rice, CIGR1 and CIGR2 (chitin-inducible gibberellin-responsive), inducible by the potent elicitor N -acetylchitooligosaccharide (GN), are rapidly induced by exogenous gibberellins. The pattern of mRNA accumulation was dependent on the dose and biological activity of the gibberellins, suggesting that the induction of the genes by gibberellin is mediated by a biological receptor capable of specific recognition and signal transduction upon perception of the phytoactive compounds. Further pharmacological analysis revealed that the CIGR1 and CIGR2 mRNA accumulation by treatment with gibberellin is dependent upon protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. In rice calli derived from slender rice 1, a constitutive gibberellin-responsive mutant, or d1, a mutant deficient in the alpha -subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, CIGR1 and CIGR2 were induced by a GN elicitor, yet not by gibberellin. Neither gibberellin nor GN showed related activities in defense or development, respectively. These results strongly suggested that the signal transduction cascade from gibberellin is independent of that from GN, and further implied that CIGR1 and CIGR2 have dual, distinct roles in defense and development.

16714407	Morphological alteration caused by brassinosteroid insensitivity increases the biomass and grain production of rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	The rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant d61 phenotype is caused by loss of function of a rice BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 ortholog, OsBRI1. We have identified nine d61 alleles, the weakest of which, d61-7, confers agronomically important traits such as semidwarf stature and erect leaves. Because erect-leaf habit is considered to increase light capture for photosynthesis, we compared the biomass and grain production of wild-type and d61-7 rice. The biomass of wild type was 38% higher than that of d61-7 at harvest under conventional planting density because of the dwarfism of d61-7. However, the biomass of d61-7 was 35% higher than that of wild type at high planting density. The grain yield of wild type reached a maximum at middensity, but the yield of d61-7 continued to increase with planting density. These results indicate that d61-7 produces biomass more effectively than wild type, and consequently more effectively assimilates the biomass in reproductive organ development at high planting density. However, the small grain size of d61-7 counters any increase in grain yield, leading to the same grain yield as that of wild type even at high density. We therefore produced transgenic rice with partial suppression of endogenous OsBRI1 expression to obtain the erect-leaf phenotype without grain changes. The estimated grain yield of these transformants was about 30% higher than that of wild type at high density. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating erect-leaf plants by modifying the expression of the brassinosteroid receptor gene in transgenic rice plants.
16040652	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling.	2005	Plant Physiol	Molecular genetic studies of plant dwarf mutants have indicated that gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) are two major factors that determine plant height; dwarf mutants that are caused by other defects are relatively rare, especially in monocot species. Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR. In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions. Positional cloning of DGL1 revealed that it encodes a 60-kD microtubule-severing katanin-like protein. The protein was found to be important in cell elongation and division, based on the observed cell phenotypes. GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced. The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant. Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization. These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling.
15010620	The elongation defective1 mutant of Arabidopsis is impaired in the gene encoding a serine-rich secreted protein.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	Coordinated cell growth and differentiation is crucial for the development of higher plants. Using the elongation defective 1-1 (eld1-1) mutant, we cloned the ELD1 gene, which encodes a serine-rich protein. Genes homologous to ELD1 can be found in plants, including Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco, but not in other organisms. Using reverse genetics, we identified a new allele, eld1-2, which is phenotypically indistinguishable from eld1-1, but does not produce a detectable ELD1 transcript. The ELD1 gene sequence is the same as that of the KOBITO1 sequence. However, the kob1 mutants display weak phenotype relative to the two eld1 mutants, which are likely null alleles. KOB1 was reported to be a membrane protein involved in cellulose synthesis. However, based on ELD1-GFP localization in plasmolyzed cells, we found that ELD1 is localized to the cell wall/extracellular matrix, rather than the membrane. Thus, ELD1/KOB1 is a secreted protein involved in promoting cell growth. To investigate the relationship between ELD1 and Arabidopsis genes with high sequence similarity, we analyzed the possible subcellular location of their proteins as well as their amino acid sequence. The ELD1-related proteins in Arabidopsis were predicted to be localized to subcellular compartments different from that of ELD1. Thus, ELD1 is likely to be functionally distinct from related Arabidopsis genes. These results suggest that ELD1 is a single-copy gene which belongs to a small family of plant-specific genes with diverse function.
15338279	Identification of a 98-kb DNA segment containing the rice Eui gene controlling uppermost internode elongation, and construction of a TAC transgene sublibrary.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	The recessive 'tall rice' phenotype associated with the mutation eui (elongated upper-most internode) is an important agronomic trait that has been introduced into hybrid rice to eliminate panicle enclosure in all types of male-sterile lines and produce good-quality seeds in high yield and at low cost. Based on our previous Eui mapping data, we conducted fine-structure mapping and positional cloning of the gene using an F2 population comprising more than 5000 individuals derived from a cross of the near-isogenic lines 307T (eui/eui) with the recurrent parent Zhenshan 97 (Eui/Eui). In total 45 CAPS (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences) markers located within an interval of 14.5 cM were analyzed in the subpopulation of 1298 homozygous recessive plants. The resulting high-resolution map defined a 98-kb interval containing the Eui locus flanked by the markers M0387 and M01, and three markers were found to co-segregate with Eui. In order to facilitate the identification of the Eui gene, we used a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector to construct a set of contiguous TAC clones from the Nipponbare BACs (obtained from the Clemson University Genome Institute; CUGI) spanning this region. These clones can be used to streamline complementation testing. The markers tightly linked to the Eui locus can also be used in breeding male-sterile lines with the elongated uppermost internode.
16463101	Fine mapping and in silico isolation of the EUI1 gene controlling upper internode elongation in rice.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Upper internode elongation in rice is an important agronomic trait. Well-known mutants with an elongated uppermost internode (eui) are important germplasms for developing unsheathed-panicle male-sterile lines in hybrid rice breeding. We finely mapped the eui1 gene and identified its candidate gene using in silico analysis based on previous research work and rice genomic sequence data. The rice eui1 gene was mapped to two overlapping BAC clones, OSJNBa0095J22 and OSJNBb0099O15, between the markers AC40 and AC46, that were 0.64 cM apart and spanned approximately 152 kb. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker AC41 that cosegregated with eui1 was located in an intron of a putative cytochrome P450-related gene. In silico analysis suggested that this encoded the cytochrome CYP714D1. Allelic sequencing confirmed that EUI1 corresponded to this P450 gene. A gamma ray-induced eui1 mutant carried a deletion in exon II of the EUI1 gene, and resulted in a frame-shift deletion that produced a truncated polypeptide. We conclude that the EUI1 gene controlling the upper internode elongation in rice is 9,804 bp long, and comprises two exons and one intron. The length of the cDNA is 1,931 bp containing a 1,734 bp ORF, a 110 bp 5'-UTR and a 87 bp 3'-UTR. The ORF encodes an unknown 577 amino acid functional protein, that appears to be a member of the cytochrome P450 family.
15928962	Identification and confirmation of three neutral alleles conferring wide compatibility in inter-subspecific hybrids of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using near-isogenic lines.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Wide-compatibility varieties (WCVs) are a special class of rice germplasm that is able to produce fertile hybrids when crossed to both indica and japonica subspecies. Previous studies determined 'Dular' and 02428 as two WCVs and identified a number of QTLs as having large effects on fertility of inter-subspecific hybrids. In this study, we developed five near-isogenic lines (NILs) for three of the QTLs, f5, f6 and S5, by backcrossing and marker-assisted selection, using "Dular" and 02428 as the donors and "Zhenshan 97" as the recipient. Three of the NILs each carried one introgressed allele, and two NILs each carried two introgressed alleles in combinations. The NILs were testcrossed to an indica tester "Nanjing 11" and a japonica tester "Balilla". The results showed that the f5 allele from "Dular"(f5-Du) is a neutral allele conferring wide compatibility, with a large effect on both pollen and spikelet fertility, and the f6 allele from "Dular" (f6-Du) is a neutral allele for spikelet fertility with smaller effect. The S5 allele from 02428 (S5-08) was confirmed to be a neutral allele for spikelet fertility. It is likely that f6 and S5 are the same locus as deduced by their genomic locations and effects. The results also showed that even in combination, two neutral alleles of different loci were not able to produce normal fertility hybrids in typical indica-japonica crosses. The implications of the findings in rice breeding programs are discussed.
16317572	Fine mapping of f5-Du, a gene conferring wide-compatibility for pollen fertility in inter-subspecific hybrids of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Wide-compatibility varieties (WCVs), comprising a special class of rice germplasm, are able to produce fertile hybrids when crossed with both indica and japonica varieties. Dular, a landrace variety from India, has both a wide spectrum and high level of wide-compatibility when crossed with a range of indica and japonica varieties. In previous studies, an allele at the f5 locus from Dular (f5-Du) was identified as a neutral allele conferring wide-compatibility with a large effect on both pollen and spikelet fertility. Using a population of 1993 hybrid plants derived from a cross between ZS(f5-Du/f5-ZS) (F1 of near isogenic line of Zhenshan 97 containing f5-Du) and Balilla (a japonica tester), f5-Du was genetically mapped to an interval of about 1.6 cM, with 0.8 cM from both SSR markers WFPM3 and WFPR1. Combined with bioinformatic analysis, a contig map was constructed for the f5 region, consisting of five bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones and spanning approximately 437 kb in length. By assaying the recombinant events in the region with markers developed using the sequence information, the f5 locus was further narrowed down to a 70 kb fragment containing nine predicted genes. The result will be very useful for cloning this gene and marker-assisted transferring of the neutral allele in rice breeding programs.
15941402	White-core endosperm floury endosperm-4 in rice is generated by knockout mutations in the C-type pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase gene (OsPPDKB).	2005	Plant J	We have isolated a floury endosperm-4 (flo4) rice mutant with a floury-white endosperm but a normal outer portion. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed that this abnormal endosperm consisted of loosely packed starch granules. The mutant phenotype was generated by T-DNA insertion into the fifth intron of the OsPPDKB gene encoding pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK). Plants containing flo4-1 produced no OsPPDKB transcript or the OsPPDKB protein in their developing kernels and leaves. We obtained two additional alleles, flo4-2 and flo4-3, that also showed the same white-core endosperm phenotype. The flo4 kernels weighed about 6% less than wild-type ones. Starch contents in both kernel types were similar, but the total protein content was slightly higher in the mutant kernels. Moreover, lipid contents were significantly increased in the flo4 kernels. Expression analyses demonstrated that the cytosolic mRNA of OsPPDKB was induced in the reproductive organs after pollination, and greatly increased until about 10 days after fertilization. This mRNA was localized mainly in the endosperm, aleurone, and scutellum of the developing kernel. Our results suggest that cytosolic PPDK functions in rice to modulate carbon metabolism during grain filling.
10394940	Identification of cis-regulatory elements required for endosperm expression of the rice storage protein glutelin gene GluB-1.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Rice storage protein glutelin genes are coordinately regulated during seed development. A previous 5' deletion analysis using transgenic tobacco revealed that the minimum 5' region necessary for endosperm specificity was within -245 bp of the transcription start site, and included the AACA and GCN4 motifs that are highly conserved in the 5'-flanking regions of all glutelin genes. In this paper, the sequence elements essential for endosperm-specific expression are characterized in stable transgenic tobacco plants by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using this minimum promoter. Base substitution analysis shows that the proximal AACA motif between -73 and -61, and the GCN4 motif between -165 and -158 act as critical elements. An ACGT motif between -81 and -75, and Skn-I-like elements between -173 and -169 also play important roles in controlling the seed-specific expression. When the distal region between -245 and -145 containing the AACA and the GCN4 motifs or the proximal region between -113 and -46 containing the ACGT and AACA motifs is fused to a truncated promoter (-90 to +9) of the CaMV 35S gene fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, high levels of seed-specific expression are observed in these fusions, thereby indicating that either pair of motifs is sufficient to confer seed expression in these fusions. However, when substituted for by the CaMV 35S core promoter (-46 to +1), seed expression is abolished, suggesting that the sequence between -90 and -46 of the CaMV 35S promoter containing G-box-like motif (as-1 element) is required for such specific expression in addition to AACA and GCN4 motifs. Therefore, we conclude that at least three cis-regulatory elements, the AACA motif, GCN4 motif and ACGT motif, are necessary to mediate endosperm expression of the GluB-1 glutelin gene.
12602898	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	The Gns1 gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) encodes 1,3;1,4-beta glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73), which hydrolyzes 1,3;1,4-beta-glucosidic linkages on 1,3;1,4-beta-glucan, an important component of cell walls in the Poaceae family. RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene. To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene. The introduced Gns1 gene was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and its products were found in the apoplast and accumulated in up to 0.1% of total soluble protein in leaves. Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation. When transgenic plants were inoculated with virulent blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), they developed many resistant-type lesions on the inoculated leaf accompanying earlier activation of defense-related genes PR-1 and PBZ1 than in control plants. Transgenic plants spontaneously produced brown specks, similar in appearance to those reported for an initiation type of disease-lesion-mimic mutants, on the third and fourth leaves and occasionally on older leaves without inoculation of pathogens. Expression of the two defense-related genes was drastically increased after the emergence of the lesion-mimic phenotype.
16770601	Fine mapping of a quantitative trait locus for grain number per panicle from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	SIL040, an introgression line (IL) developed by introgressing chromosomal segments from an accession of Oryza rufipogon into an indica cultivar Guichao 2, showed significantly less grains per panicle than the recurrent parent Guichao 2. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in F2 and F3 generations derived from the cross between SIL040 and Guichao 2 revealed that gpa7, a QTL located on the short arm of chromosome 7, was responsible of this variation. Alleles from O. rufipogon decreased grains per panicle. To fine mapping of gpa7, a high-resolution map with 1,966 F2 plants derived from the cross between SIL040 and Guichao 2 using markers flanking gpa7 was constructed, and detailed quantitative evaluation of the structure of main panicle of each of F3 families derived from recombinants screened was performed. By two-step substitution mapping, gpa7 was finally narrowed down to a 35-kb region that contains five predicted genes in cultivated rice. The fact that QTLs for five panicle traits (length of panicle, primary branches per panicle, secondary branches per panicle, grains on primary branches and grains on secondary branches) were all mapped in the same interval as that for gpa7 suggested that this locus was associated with panicle structure, showing pleiotropic effects. The characterizing of panicle structure of IL SIL040 further revealed that, during the domestication from common wild allele to cultivated rice one at gpa7, not only the number of branches and grains per panicle increased significantly, more importantly, but also the ratio of secondary branches per panicle to total branches per panicle and the ratio of grains on secondary branches per panicle to total grains per panicle increased significantly. All these results reinforced the idea that gpa7 might play an important role in the regulation of grain number per panicle and the ratio of secondary branches per panicle during the domestication of rice panicle.
16835766	Molecular mapping of a novel gene, Grh5, conferring resistance to green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler) in rice, Oryza sativa L.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The green rice leafhopper (GRH), Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler, is one of the most serious insect pests affecting cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) in temperate regions of East Asia. An accession of the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon Griff. (W1962), was found to be highly resistant to GRH by an antibiosis test. To understand the genetic basis of the GRH resistance, a BC1F1 population derived from a cross between a susceptible Japonica variety, Taichung 65 (T65), and a highly resistant accession W1962 was analyzed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. A single major QTL for GRH resistance was detected on rice chromosome 8. A nearly isogenic population containing segments of the targeted QTL region derived from W1962 was then developed through advanced backcrossing with marker-assisted selection. Further molecular mapping using a BC4F2 population revealed that a new resistance gene, designated as Green rice leafhopper resistance 5 (Grh5), was located on the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 8 and tightly linked to the simple sequence repeat markers RM3754 and RM3761. A nearly isogenic line (NIL) carrying Grh5 was subsequently developed in the progeny of the mapping population. The resistance level of Grh5-NIL was compared with those of developed NILs for GRH resistance and was found to have the highest resistance. The DNA markers found to be closely linked to Grh5 would be useful for marker-assisted selection for the improvement of resistance to GRH in rice.
15618434	A novel cis-element that is responsive to oxidative stress regulates three antioxidant defense genes in rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	All organisms have defense systems against oxidative stress that include multiple genes of antioxidant defense. These genes are induced by reactive oxygen species under condition of oxidative stress. In this study, we found that a 28-bp motif is conserved on the promoter regions of three antioxidant defense genes in rice (Oryza sativa): cytosolic superoxide dismutase (sodCc1), cytosolic thioredoxin (trxh), and glutaredoxin (grx). We demonstrated that the 28-bp sequence acts as a cis-element responsive to oxidative stress by transient expression assay and designated it as CORE (coordinate regulatory element for antioxidant defense). The CORE was activated by methyl viologen treatment and induced a 3.1-fold increase in expression of the reporter gene, but it did not respond to hydrogen peroxide. The expressions of the sodCc1, trxh, and grx genes were coordinately induced by methyl viologen, suggesting that multiple genes involved in antioxidant defense are controlled by a common regulatory mechanism via CORE. Application of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor caused the constitutive induction of the sodCc1, trxh, and grx genes and the activation of CORE without methyl viologen treatment. These results indicate that a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is involved in the gene regulation mediated by CORE.
10949377	Enhanced tolerance to salt stress in transgenic rice that overexpresses chloroplast glutamine synthetase.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	The potential role of photorespiration in the protection against salt stress was examined with transgenic rice plants. Oryza sativa L. cv. Kinuhikari was transformed with a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (GS2) gene from rice. Each transgenic rice plant line showed a different accumulation level of GS2. A transgenic plant line, G39-2, which accumulated about 1.5-fold more GS2 than the control plant, had an increased photorespiration capacity. In another line, G241-12, GS2 was almost lost and photorespiration activity could not be detected. Fluorescence quenching analysis revealed that photorespiration could prevent the over-reduction of electron transport systems. When exposed to 150 mM NaCl for 2 weeks, the control rice plants completely lost photosystem II activity, but G39-2 plants retained more than 90% activity after the 2-week treatment, whereas G241-12 plants lost these activities within one week. In the presence of isonicotinic acid hydrazide, an inhibitor of photorespiration, G39-2 showed the same salt tolerance as the control plants. The intracellular contents of NH4+ and Na+ in the stressed plants correlated well with the levels of GS2. Thus, the enhancement of photorespiration conferred resistance to salt in rice plants. Preliminary results suggest chilling tolerance in the transformant.
17092317	The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds.	2006	Plant J	Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait for grain production. The HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 (HTD1) gene encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3. Complementation analyses for HTD1 confirm that the defect in HTD1 is responsible for both high-tillering and dwarf phenotypes in the htd1 mutant. The rescue of the Arabidopsis max3 mutant phenotype by the introduction of Pro(35S):HTD1 indicates HTD1 is a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase that has the same function as MAX3 in synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signal molecule. The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues. By evaluating Pro(HTD1):GUS expression, we found that the HTD1 gene is mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant. Auxin induction of HTD1 expression suggests that auxin may regulate rice tillering partly through upregulation of HTD1 gene transcription. Restoration of dwarf phenotype after the removal of axillary buds indicates that the dwarfism of the htd1 mutant may be a consequence of excessive tiller production. In addition, the expression of HTD1, D3 and OsCCD8a in the htd1 and d3 mutants suggests a feedback mechanism may exist for the synthesis and perception of the carotenoid-derived signal in rice. Characterization of MAX genes in Arabidopsis, and identification of their orthologs in pea, petunia and rice indicates the existence of a conserved mechanism for shoot-branching regulation in both monocots and dicots.
16623909	Genome-wide analysis of spatial and temporal gene expression in rice panicle development.	2006	Plant J	The basic structure of a rice inflorescence (the panicle) is determined by the pattern of branch formation, which is established at the early stages of panicle development. In this study we conducted global transcriptome profiling of the early stages of rice panicle development from phase transition to floral organ differentiation. To generate a meristem-specific gene-expression profile, shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and subsequently formed, very young panicles were collected manually and used for cDNA microarray analysis. We identified 357 out of 22,000 genes that are expressed differentially in the early stages of panicle development, and the 357 genes were classified into seven groups based on their temporal expression patterns. The most noticeable feature is that a fairly small number of genes, which are extensively enriched in transcription factors, are upregulated in the SAM immediately after phase transition. In situ hybridization analysis showed that each gene analysed exhibits a unique and interesting localization of mRNA. Remarkably, one of the transcription factors was proven to be a close downstream component of the pathway in which LAX, a major regulator of panicle branching, acts. These results suggest that our strategy--careful collection of meristems, global transcriptome analysis and subsequent in situ hybridization analysis--is useful not only to obtain a genome-wide view of gene expression, but also to reveal genetic networks controlling rice panicle development.
16525838	Molecular mapping of a gene 'ld(t)' controlling cleistogamy in rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Cleistogamy is the self-pollination within closed spikelets and is expected to be a useful genetic tool for prevention of possible gene transfer in transgenic crops, for maintenance of genetic purity in autogamous crops, and for increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Mapping of the gene ld(t), which is responsible for lack of lodicules inside spikelets and causes cleistogamy, was carried out using F2 and F3 populations derived from a cleistogamous (CL) mutant CL-SNU x Milyang 23 cross. A number of STS markers along chromosomes were developed and bulked segregant analysis was adopted for preliminary mapping. The results showed that the ld(t) was located at the end region of chromosome 1L, flanked by S01178b (an STS marker developed for the locus at 178 cM based on the rice genetic map reported by Japanese Rice Genome Project) at 0.8 cM and co-segregated with S01181a and S01181b (an STS marker developed for the locus at 181 cM).
15940509	Fine mapping of the rice low phytic acid (Lpa1) locus.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Phytic acid is the primary storage form of phosphorus (P) in cereal grains. In addition to being essential for normal seedling growth and development, phytic acid plays an important role in human and animal nutrition. The rice low phytic acid mutation lpa1 results in a 45% reduction in seed phytic acid with a molar equivalent increase in inorganic P. The Lpa1 locus was previously mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2. Using microsatellite markers and a recombinant inbred line population, we fine mapped this locus between the markers RM3542 and RM482, which encompass a region of 135 kb. Additional markers were developed from the DNA sequence of this region. Two of these markers further delimited the locus to a 47-kb region containing eight putative open reading frames. Cloning and molecular characterization of the Lpa1 gene will provide insight into phytic acid biosynthesis in plants. The markers reported here should also be useful in introgressing the low phytic acid phenotype into other rice cultivars.
15448199	Characterization of the silicon uptake system and molecular mapping of the silicon transporter gene in rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Oochikara) is a typical silicon-accumulating plant, but the mechanism responsible for the high silicon uptake by the roots is poorly understood. We characterized the silicon uptake system in rice roots by using a low-silicon rice mutant (lsi1) and wild-type rice. A kinetic study showed that the concentration of silicon in the root symplastic solution increased with increasing silicon concentrations in the external solution but saturated at a higher concentration in both lines. There were no differences in the silicon concentration of the symplastic solution between the wild-type rice and the mutant. The form of soluble silicon in the root, xylem, and leaf identified by (29)Si-NMR was also the same in the two lines. However, the concentration of silicon in the xylem sap was much higher in the wild type than in the mutant. These results indicate that at least two transporters are involved in silicon transport from the external solution to the xylem and that the low-silicon rice mutant is defective in loading silicon into xylem rather than silicon uptake from external solution to cortical cells. To map the responsible gene, we performed a bulked segregant analysis by using both microsatellite and expressed sequence tag-based PCR markers. As a result, the gene was mapped to chromosome 2, flanked by microsatellite marker RM5303 and expressed sequence tag-based PCR marker E60168.
11713677	Micron, a microsatellite-targeting transposable element in the rice genome.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	We have isolated a new family of mobile elements, Micron, which occur within microsatellites dispersed throughout the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. The first of these segments, Micron 001, was found in a microsatellite consisting of a (TA)n sequence upstream of the rice phytochrome A (phyA) gene. PCR analysis of related rice species suggests that Micron 001 integrated into this microsatellite locus prior to the divergence of the two wild species O. rufipogon and O. barthii from a common ancestor. Micron elements are short (393-bp), possess subterminal inverted repeats and the single strands have the potential to form stable secondary structures via several internal repeats. Aside from the absence of terminal inverted repeats, these characteristics resemble those of MITEs (Miniature Inverted-Repeat Transposable Elements). We estimate that 100-200 copies of Micron-related sequences are present in the rice nuclear genome, while the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes lack this sequence. Nineteen homologs of Micron 001 exhibited extremely high nucleotide sequence conservation (greater than 90%), suggesting a recent spread of Micron elements within the genus Oryza. Surprisingly, nucleotide sequence alignments showed that all of the Micron elements are flanked on both sides by microsatellite sequence consisting mainly of (TA)n. Twenty-three elements were mapped to seven separate chromosomes. Therefore Micron elements form a family of dispersed, highly conserved repeats. This is the first report of a transposable element that targets microsatellite loci.
8879237	A chloroplast-derived sequence is utilized as a source of promoter sequences for the gene for subunit 9 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad9) in rice mitochondria.	1996	Mol Gen Genet	The chloroplast-derived sequence trnS-rps4/ 3'trnL-trnF-ndhJ-ndhK (4066 bases in length) is present in a region that starts 355 bases upstream of the gene for subunit 9 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad9) in the mitochondrial genome of rice. Northern blot hybridization revealed that three large transcripts of 3.05, 1.62 and 1.05 kb hybridized to strand-specific probes for both the nad9 gene and the chloroplast-derived sequence, indicating that the nad9 gene was transcribed together with the chloroplast-derived sequence. From the results of in vitro capping and ribonuclease protection experiments, as well as primer extension analysis, we identified at least seven sites for the initiation of transcription of nad9 in the chloroplast-derived sequence. All of the initiation sites for transcription of the nad9 gene were located in sequences homologous to chloroplast DNA. Two of seven initiation sites were flanked by a sequence homologous to the consensus promoter motif that includes the CRTA motif (where R is A or G) of the rice mitochondrion. However, the sequences surrounding the other five sites showed only limited similarity to the conserved sequence. It is suggested that all the promoters of the rice nad9 gene exist in a sequence that was transferred from the chloroplast during evolution. Thus, the chloroplast-derived sequence has a novel, significant function in the mitochondrial genome of this higher plant.
9952442	Cloning of nicotianamine synthase genes, novel genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytosiderophores.	1999	Plant Physiol	Nicotianamine synthase (NAS), the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for the mugineic acid family of phytosiderophores, catalyzes the trimerization of S-adenosylmethionine to form one molecule of nicotianamine. We purified NAS protein and isolated the genes nas1, nas2, nas3, nas4, nas5-1, nas5-2, and nas6, which encode NAS and NAS-like proteins from Fe-deficient barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Ehimehadaka no. 1) roots. Escherichia coli expressing nas1 showed NAS activity, confirming that this gene encodes a functional NAS. Expression of nas genes as determined by northern-blot analysis was induced by Fe deficiency and was root specific. The NAS genes form a multigene family in the barley and rice genomes.
15220467	Down-regulation of metallothionein, a reactive oxygen scavenger, by the small GTPase OsRac1 in rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	Metallothioneins are small, ubiquitous Cys-rich proteins known to be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and metal homeostasis. We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus. OsMT2b-overexpressing cells showed reduced elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production. In contrast, homozygous OsMT2b::Tos17-inserted mutant and OsMT2b-RNAi-silenced transgenic cells showed significantly higher elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production than the wild-type cells. In vitro assay showed that recombinant OsMT2b protein possessed superoxide- and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities. Taken together, these results showed that OsMT2b is an ROS scavenger and its expression is down-regulated by OsRac1, thus potentiating ROS, which function as signals in resistance response. The results suggest that OsRac1 plays a dual role as an inducer of ROS production and a suppressor of ROS scavenging.
16798873	Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Many bacterial diseases of plants depend on the interaction of type III effector genes of the pathogen and disease-susceptibility genes of the host. The host susceptibility genes are largely unknown. Here, we show that expression of the rice gene Os8N3, a member of the MtN3 gene family from plants and animals, is elevated upon infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) and depends on the type III effector gene pthXo1. Os8N3 resides near xa13, and PXO99(A) failed to induce Os8N3 in rice lines with xa13. Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen. The effector gene avrXa7 from strain PXO86 enabled PXO99(A) compatibility on either xa13- or Os8N3-silenced plants. The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1. The results support the hypothesis that X. oryzae pv. oryzae commandeers the regulation of otherwise developmentally regulated host genes to induce a state of disease susceptibility. Furthermore, the results support a model in which the pathogen induces disease susceptibility in a gene-for-gene manner.
16623902	Identification and functional analysis of a prokaryotic-type aspartate aminotransferase: implications for plant amino acid metabolism.	2006	Plant J	In this paper, we report the identification of genes from pine (PpAAT), Arabidopsis (AtAAT) and rice (OsAAT) encoding a novel class of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT, EC 2.6.1.1) in plants. The enzyme is unrelated to other eukaryotic AATs from plants and animals but similar to bacterial enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this prokaryotic-type AAT is closely related to cyanobacterial enzymes, suggesting it might have an endosymbiotic origin. Interestingly, most of the essential residues involved in the interaction with the substrate and the attachment of pyridoxal phosphate cofactor in the active site of the enzyme were conserved in the deduced polypeptide. The polypeptide is processed in planta to a mature subunit of 45 kDa that is immunologically distinct from the cytosolic, mitochondrial and chloroplastic isoforms of AAT previously characterized in plants. Functional expression of PpAAT sequences in Escherichia coli showed that the processed precursor is assembled into a catalytically active homodimeric holoenzyme that is strictly specific for aspartate. These atypical genes are predominantly expressed in green tissues of pine, Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting a key role of this AAT in nitrogen metabolism associated with photosynthetic activity. Moreover, immunological analyses revealed that the plant prokaryotic-type AAT is a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein. This implies that two plastidic AAT co-exist in plants: a eukaryotic type previously characterized and the prokaryotic type described here. The respective roles of these two enzymes in plant amino acid metabolism are discussed.
9037160	Expression characteristics of OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2, two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Deepwater rice can grow in the regions of Southeast Asia that are flooded during the monsoon season because it has several adaptations allowing it to survive under flooded conditions. One such adaptation is the ability for rapid internode elongation upon partial submergence to maintain its foliage above the rising flood water levels. Ethylene is considered to be the trigger of this growth response because deepwater conditions not only trap ethylene in submerged organs, but also enhance the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase. Herein we have studied the expression characteristics of two members of the five-member multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2 and show that partial submergence induces expression of OS-ACS1 and suppresses expression of OS-ACS2. The induction of OS-ACS1 occurs within 12 h of partial submergence and at low oxygen concentrations. The data also suggest that deepwater conditions posttranscriptionally regulate ACC synthase activity. OS-ACS1 gene expression may contribute to longer-term ethylene production, but not to the initial, growth-promoting increase in ethylene synthesis.
12011339	Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice.	2002	Plant Physiol	At least two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes (ACS) are implicated in the submergence response of rice (Oryza sativa). Previously, the OS-ACS5 gene has been shown to be induced during short- as well as long-term complete submergence of seedlings and to be controlled by a balance of gibberellin and abscisic acid in both lowland and deepwater rice. This study demonstrates that OS-ACS5 mRNA is localized in specific tissues and cells both during normal development and in response to complete submergence. The temporal and spatial regulation of OS-ACS5 expression is presented by in situ hybridization and histochemical analysis of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice carrying an OS-ACS5-gus fusion. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths. In response to complete submergence, the expression in vascular bundles of young stems and leaf sheaths was strongly induced. The results of histochemical GUS assays were consistent with those found by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Our findings suggest that OS-ACS5 plays a role in vegetative growth of rice under normal conditions and is also recruited for enhanced growth upon complete submergence. The possible implication of OS-ACS5 in root-shoot communication during submergence stress and its putative role in aerenchyma formation upon low-oxygen stress are discussed.
17059407	Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development.	2006	Plant J	Development and organogenesis in both dicot and monocot plants are highly dependent on polar auxin transport (PAT), which requires the proper asymmetric localization of both auxin influx and efflux carriers. In the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the trafficking and localization of auxin efflux facilitators such as PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) are mediated by GNOM, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of small GTPases, but molecular regulators of the auxin influx facilitators remain unknown. Here, we show that over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase-activating protein (ARF-GAP) in rice, impaired PAT and interfered with both primary and lateral root development. The lateral root phenotype could be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin 1-naphthyl acetic acid, but not by indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) or by 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid, which require influx facilitators to enter the cells. OsAGAP-over-expressing plants had alterations in vesicle trafficking and localization of the presumptive A. thaliana auxin-influx carrier AUX1, but not in the localization of the auxin efflux facilitators. Together, our data suggest that OsAGAP has a specific role in regulating vesicle trafficking pathways such as the auxin influx pathway, which in turn controls auxin-dependent root growth in plants.
8052231	Functional dissection of a rice high-pI alpha-amylase gene promoter.	1994	Mol Gen Genet	Deletion analysis has previously shown that a 260 bp fragment, located between positions -230 and +29 of the 5' end of a rice high-pI alpha--amylase gene, OSamy-c, is required for gibberellic acid (GA3)-dependent transcriptional activation. We have since established a quantitative transient assay based on expression of a luciferase reporter gene in rice aleurone cells and continued to characterize the OSamy-c promoter for GA3-dependent regulatory sequences. Using this method, we have shown that the DNA sequence between -158 and -46 (sequence I) is sufficient to confer GA3-responsive activation on OSamy-c. We have also shown that this sequence is capable of directing GA3-dependent expression from a heterologous minimal promoter. Our results also showed that sequence I confers GA3 regulatory control in an orientation-dependent manner and interacts with two further upstream DNA sequences, II and III, in a combination which mildly enhances the level of the GA3 response exhibited by sequence I. Thus, we propose that sequence I confers the fundamental GA3-responsive character on OSamy-c, and that regulatory proteins that bind sequences II and III interact with each other and with regulatory proteins that bind sequence I, effectively to modulate the GA3 response.
16514560	Cloning and characterization of a second form of the rice adenine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (OsAPT2) and its association with TGMS.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	A rice gene, OsAPT2, which encodes a putative adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), was cloned and characterized. Analysis of the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed seven exons and six introns in the OsAPT2. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsAPT2 is highly homologous to those of previously isolated APRTs. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the OsAPT2 transcript in the young panicles of 'Annong S-1' is down-regulated at 29 degrees C, the critical temperature for induction of 'Annong S-1' fertility conversion. Since the panicle is likely the thermo-sensitive organ at the early stages of pollen fertility alternation, the observed heat-induced change in the OsAPT2 expression pattern in young panicles may mediate, at least in part, thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) in 'Annong S-1'. An antisense strategy was used to suppress the expression of the OsAPT2 homolog in Arabidopsis, and the obtained homozygous transgenic plants contained lower AMP content, displayed lower pollen germination rates and exhibited some abnormalities in leaf phenotypes and flowering timing. These data suggest that OsAPT2 is likely to be involved in TGMS in the rice line 'Annong S-1'.
16850192	OsBISAMT1, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses.	2006	Mol Biol Rep	We isolated and identified a full-length cDNA, OsBISAMT1 [Oryza sativa L. benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced SAMT 1], which encodes a putative S-adenosyl-L: -methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT) from rice. OsBISAMT1 contains an ORE of 1128 bp, which predicts to encode a 375 aa protein. The OsBISAMT1 protein sequence shows a high level of identity to known plant SAMTs and contains a conserved characteristic methyltransferase domain. OsBISAMT1 is a member of a small gene family in the rice genome. Expression of OsBISAMT1 in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance. OsBISAMT1 was also up-regulated in both incompatible and compatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grsiea, but the induced expression of OsBISAMT1 was greater and more rapid in the incompatible interaction than that in the compatible one. Moreover, mechanical wounding also activated OsBISAMT1 expression. The results suggest that OsBISAMT1 may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice.
16407447	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Since first identifying two alleles of a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61, that were also defective in an orthologous gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), we have isolated eight additional alleles, including null mutations, of the rice BRI1 gene OsBRI1. The most severe mutant, d61-4, exhibited severe dwarfism and twisted leaves, although pattern formation and differentiation were normal. This severe shoot phenotype was caused mainly by a defect in cell elongation and the disturbance of cell division after the determination of cell fate. In contrast to its severe shoot phenotype, the d61-4 mutant had a mild root phenotype. Concomitantly, the accumulation of castasterone, the active BR in rice, was up to 30-fold greater in the shoots, while only 1.5-fold greater in the roots. The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsBRI1 is not essential for pattern formation or organ initiation, but is involved in organ development through controlling cell division and elongation. In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots.
15952067	Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by chlorophyll a oxygenase. We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes. They are positioned in tandem, probably resulting from recent gene duplications. The proteins they encode contain two conserved functional motifs - the Rieske Fe-sulfur coordinating center and a non-heme mononuclear Fe-binding site. OsCAO1 is induced by light and is preferentially expressed in photosynthetic tissues. Its mRNA level decreases when plants are grown in the dark. In contrast, OsCAO2 mRNA levels are higher under dark conditions, and its expression is down-regulated by exposure to light. To elucidate the physiological function of the CAO genes, we have isolated knockout mutant lines tagged by T-DNA or Tos17. Mutant plants containing a T-DNA insertion in the first intron of the OsCAO1 gene have pale green leaves, indicating chlorophyll b deficiency. We have also isolated a pale green mutant with a Tos17 insertion in that OsCAO1 gene. In contrast, OsCAO2 knockout mutant leaves do not differ significantly from the wild type. These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark.
15980189	A gibberellin-regulated calcineurin B in rice localizes to the tonoplast and is implicated in vacuole function.	2005	Plant Physiol	Many developmental and environmental signals are transduced through changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, yet only a few calcium-binding proteins have been identified in plants. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins are calcium-binding proteins that are thought to function as plant signal transduction elements. RNA profiling using a rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare) oligonucleotide microarray was used to monitor gene expression in de-embryonated rice grains. This analysis showed that a putative rice CBL gene responded to gibberellic acid, but not abscisic acid, treatment. The CBL gene family in rice contains at least 10 genes and these have extensive similarity to the CBLs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assays, rice CBLs interact with the kinase partners of Arabidopsis CBLs. Only one rice CBL gene, OsCBL2, is up-regulated by GA in the aleurone layer. A homolog with 91% sequence identity to OsCBL2 was cloned from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya), and designated HvCBL2. We examined the localization and function of OsCBL2 and HvCBL2 in rice and barley aleurone because changes in cytosolic calcium have been implicated in the response of the aleurone cell to GA. Green fluorescent protein translational fusions of OsCBL2 and OsCBL3 were localized to the tonoplast of aleurone cell protein storage vacuoles and OsCBL4-green fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Data from experiments using antisense expression of OsCBL2 and HvCBL2 are consistent with a role for OsCBL2 in promoting vacuolation of barley aleurone cells following treatment with GA.
12956525	Rice gene expression in response to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor: comprehensive analysis by DNA microarray with randomly selected ESTs.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	N-acetylchitooligosaccharides are potent elicitors to suspension-cultured rice cells, inducing a set of defense reactions. Expression of defense-related genes is considered to play an important role in defense reactions, and we employed microarray analysis of 8987 randomly selected expressed sequence tags to analyze the changes in gene expression caused by N-acetylchitooctaose. In this experiment, 166 genes were significantly induced and 93 genes were repressed. RNA gel blot analysis of 16 of these genes confirmed the microarray results. Of the 259 ESTs identified as responsive to N-acetylchytooctaose, 18 genes are related to signal transduction, including five calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). Among these, three novel CDPKs responsive to N-acetylchitooctaose were isolated.
15604699	OsCDPK13, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced by cold and gibberellin in rice leaf sheath.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play an important role in rice signal transduction, but the precise role of each individual CDPK is still largely unknown. Recently, a full-length cDNA encoding OsCDPK13 from rice seedling was isolated. To characterize the function of OsCDPK13, its responses to various stresses and hormones were analyzed in this study. OsCDPK13 accumulated in 2-week-old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA). OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were up-regulated in response to GA3 treatment, but suppressed in response to abscisic acid and brassinolide. Antisense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of OsCDPK13 was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type. Furthermore, OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold, but suppressed under salt and drought stresses. Sense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice. The expression of OsCDPK13 was stronger in cold-tolerant rice varieties than in cold-sensitive ones. The results suggest that OsCDPK13 might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress.
12970476	Three distinct rice cellulose synthase catalytic subunit genes required for cellulose synthesis in the secondary wall.	2003	Plant Physiol	Several brittle culm mutations of rice (Oryza sativa) causing fragility of plant tissues have been identified genetically but not characterized at a molecular level. We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9. Three CesA genes were expressed in seedlings, culms, premature panicles, and roots but not in mature leaves, and the expression profiles were almost identical among the three genes. Cellulose contents were dramatically decreased (8.9%-25.5% of the wild-type level) in the culms of null mutants of the three genes, indicating that these genes are not functionally redundant. Consistent with these results, cell walls in the cortical fiber cells were shown to be thinner in all the mutants than in wild-type plants. Based on these observations, the structure of a cellulose-synthesizing complex involved in the synthesis of the secondary cell wall is discussed.
16574868	Cellulose synthase-like CslF genes mediate the synthesis of cell wall (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucans.	2006	Science	A characteristic feature of grasses and commercially important cereals is the presence of (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans in their cell walls. We have used comparative genomics to link a major quantitative trait locus for (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan content in barley grain to a cluster of cellulose synthase-like CslF genes in rice. After insertion of rice CslF genes into Arabidopsis, we detected (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan in walls of transgenic plants using specific monoclonal antibodies and enzymatic analysis. Because wild-type Arabidopsis does not contain CslF genes or have (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucans in its walls, these experiments provide direct, gain-of-function evidence for the participation of rice CslF genes in (1,3;1,4)-beta-d-glucan biosynthesis.
14500792	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone.	2003	Plant Physiol	In the germinated cereal aleurone layer, gibberellic acids (GA) induce expression of a number of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes that participate in the mobilization of stored molecules. Previous analyses suggest that the key events controlling the GA-regulated gene expression in the aleurone are formation of active transcription machinery referred to as the GA responsive complex, followed by recruiting GAMYB. In general, bipartite promoter contexts composed of the GA-responsive element and the pyrimidine box are observed within the regulatory regions of cereal GA-responsive genes. Protein factors that recognize each promoter sequence were identified and distinct effects on the GA-mediated activation of gene expression have been also investigated; however, the connection and intercalation between two promoter motifs remain obscure. In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy1A) of rice (Oryza sativa). Transient expression of OsDOF3 in the germinated aleurone prolonged GAMYB function on the reporter expression in the absence of GA. The synergistic effect required a set of DNA bindings of two proteins on the RAmy1A promoter region. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the physical interaction of GAMYB and OsDOF3 in yeast cells, indicating that the association of GAMYB and OsDOF3 may be a functional unit in transcription regulation. The results showed the accessory function of OsDOF3 responsible for a dosage-dependent mediation of GA signaling that leads to high-level expression of physiological target genes.
16778011	A novel nuclear-localized CCCH-type zinc finger protein, OsDOS, is involved in delaying leaf senescence in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Leaf senescence is a developmentally programmed degeneration process, which is fine tuned by a complex regulatory network for plant fitness. However, molecular regulation of leaf senescence is poorly understood, especially in rice (Oryza sativa), an important staple crop for more than half of the world population. Here, we report a novel nuclear-localized CCCH-type zinc finger protein, Oryza sativa delay of the onset of senescence (OsDOS), involved in delaying leaf senescence in rice. The expression of OsDOS was down-regulated during natural leaf senescence, panicle development, and pollination, although its transcripts were accumulated in various organs. RNAi knockdown of OsDOS caused an accelerated age-dependent leaf senescence, whereas its overexpression produced a marked delay of leaf senescence, suggesting that it acts as a negative regulator for leaf senescence. A genome-wide expression analysis further confirmed its negative regulation for leaf senescence and revealed that, in particular, the jasmonate (JA) pathway was found to be hyperactive in the OsDOS RNAi transgenic lines but impaired in the OsDOS overexpressing transgenic lines, indicating that this pathway is likely involved in the OsDOS-mediated delaying of leaf senescence. Furthermore, methyl JA treatments of both seeds and detached leaves from the RNAi and the overexpressing transgenic lines showed hyper- and hyporesponses, respectively, consistent with the negative regulation of the JA pathway by OsDOS. Together, these results indicate that OsDOS is a novel nuclear protein that delays leaf senescence likely, at least in part, by integrating developmental cues to the JA pathway.
16514565	Dual function of rice OsDR8 gene in disease resistance and thiamine accumulation.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	The function of OsDR8, a rice disease resistance-responsive gene, was studied. Silencing of OsDR8 using an RNA interference approach resulted in phenotypic alteration of the plants. The transgenic plants with repressed expression of OsDR8 showed reduced resistance or susceptibility to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Magnaporthe grisea causing bacterial blight and blast, which are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide, respectively. The putative product of OsDR8 was highly homologous to an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the thiazole precursor of thiamine. Transgenic plants showing repressed expression of OsDR8 and reduced resistance had significantly lower levels of thiamine than the control plants. Exogenous application of thiamine could complement the compromised defense of the OsDR8-silenced plants. The expression level of several defense-responsive genes including the earlier functional genes of defense transduction pathway, OsPOX and OsPAL, and the downstream genes of the pathway, OsPR1a, OsPR1b, OsPR4, OsPR5 and OsPR10, was also decreased in the OsDR8-silenced plants. These results suggest that the impact of OsDR8 on disease resistance in rice may be through the regulation of expression of other defense-responsive genes and the site of OsDR8 function is on the upstream of the signal transduction pathway. In addition, the accumulation of thiamine may be essential for bacterial blight resistance and blast resistance.
16786297	OsEIL1, a rice homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3 regulates the ethylene response as a positive component.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	The plant gaseous hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development and responses to the environment. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified. OsEIL1, which showed highest similarity with EIN3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3-1 mutant. The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene. OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.
16361526	Identification of a glyphosate-resistant mutant of rice 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase using a directed evolution strategy.	2006	Plant Physiol	5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) is a key enzyme in the shikimate pathway and is targeted by the wide-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. Here, we describe the use of a selection system based on directed evolution to select glyphosate-resistant mutants of EPSPS. Using this system, the rice (Oryza sativa) EPSPS gene, mutagenized by Error-Prone polymerase chain reaction, was introduced into an EPSPS-deficient Escherichia coli strain, AB2829, and transformants were selected on minimal medium by functional complementation. Three mutants with high glyphosate resistance were identified in three independent glyphosate selection experiments. Each mutant contained a C(317)-->T transition within the EPSPS coding sequence, causing a change of proline-106 to leucine (P106L) in the protein sequence. Glyphosate resistance assays indicated a 3-fold increase in glyphosate resistance of E. coli expressing the P106L mutant. Affinity of the P106L mutant for glyphosate and phosphoenolpyruvate was decreased about 70-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively, compared to wild-type EPSPS. Analysis based on a kinetic model demonstrates that the P106L mutant has a high glyphosate resistance while retaining relatively high catalytic efficiency at low phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. A mathematical model derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation was used to characterize the effect of expression level and selection conditions on kinetic (Ki and Km) variation of the mutants. This prediction suggests that the expression level is an important aspect of the selection system. Furthermore, glyphosate resistance of the P106L mutant was confirmed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), demonstrating the potential for using the P106L mutant in transgenic crops.
15480789	Analysis of transcripts that are differentially expressed in three sectors of the rice root system under water deficit.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	Short periods of water deprivation can stimulate the growth of seminal and lateral roots in rice, and inhibit the emergence of adventitious roots. Identification of genes in the different tissues that respond to a water deficit may help us to understand the mechanism underlying root growth under conditions when water is scarce. cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to profile gene expression upon imposition of water deficit in three types of root tissue from the upland rice variety Azucena: seminal root tips, lateral root zones and adventitious root primordial zones. In all, 121 unique transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were cloned, and Northern analysis was carried out for 30 TDFs to confirm their expression patterns. Sixty-six TDFs were differentially expressed in all three root samples. Four (AC2, D6, L22 and T23) were up-regulated by water deficit in seminal root tips and lateral root zones, and down-regulated in adventitious root primordial zones, an expression pattern which reflects the phenotypic changes observed in the different root sectors. In contrast, T17 and T37 showed the opposite expression pattern in Azucena: up-regulation in adventitious roots and repression in the other two zones. Functions could be assigned to five of these six TDFs on the basis of homology: they encode an expansin (T37), a fruit-ripening protein similar to ASR (T23), submergence-induced protein 2A (T17), a dehydrin (D6) and a 9- cis -epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase1 (L22), respectively. AC2 did not show a significant match to any known gene. Northern analysis showed that these six clones exhibited expression patterns that differed between the two cultivars tested (Azucena and the lowland variety IR1552) with respect to regulation by water limitation. Furthermore, T17, T37, D6 and T23 mapped within intervals known to contain QTLs (quantitative trait loci) for root growth in rice under water deficit. These genes may regulate or co-regulate the growth and development of the three root zones in a tissue-specific manner, and may play a role in the processes that underlie the early changes in root architecture under conditions of water deprivation.
15604710	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (GA20ox) is a key enzyme that normally catalyzes the penultimate steps in GA biosynthesis. One of the GA20ox genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.), OsGA20ox2 ( SD1 ), is well known as the "Green Revolution gene", and loss-of function mutation in this locus causes semi-dwarfism. Another GA20ox gene, OsGA20ox1, has also been identified, but its contribution to plant stature has remained unclear because no suitable mutants have been available. We isolated a mutant, B142, tagged with a T-DNA containing three CaMV 35S promoters, which showed a tall, GA-overproduction phenotype. The final stature of the B142 mutant reflects internode overgrowth and is approximately twice that of its wild-type parent. This mutant responds to application of both GA3 and a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, indicating that it is a novel tall mutant of rice distinct from GA signaling mutants such as slr1 . The integrated T-DNAs, which contain three CaMV 35S promoters, are located upstream of the OsGA20ox1 open reading frame (ORF) in the B142 mutant genome. Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142. Introduction of OsGA20ox1 cDNA driven by 35S promoter into the wild type phenocopies the morphological characteristics of B142. These results indicate that the elongated phenotype of the B142 mutant is caused by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene. Moreover, the final stature of rice was reduced by specific suppression of the OsGA20ox1 gene expression. This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature.
16915516	The rice OsGAE1 is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Gibberellins (GAs) are a class of phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development processes including stem elongation, flowering, and seed germination. A novel GA-enhanced gene, designated as OsGAE1, was identified using microarray analysis of GA-regulated genes. OsGAE1 expressed in a dose- and time course-dependent manner with minimum expression at 1 microM GA(3) and maximum expression at 50 microM GA(3) starting from 30 min and peaked at 24 h after GA(3) treatment. OsGAE1 expression was up-regulated by GA(3) at transcript level while no significant effect was observed for other hormones. OsGAE1 was expressed in Escherichia coli with N-terminal His(6) tag and the recombinant protein migrated at 38 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted 29 kDa, during SDS-PAGE. Anti-OsGAE1 antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath. OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root. In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves. Northern blot, Western blot, and GUS activities revealed that OsGAE1 is up-regulated by GA(3). Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth. The transgenic plants were 55-70% short compared to control. These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice.
16792694	GAMYB controls different sets of genes and is differentially regulated by microRNA in aleurone cells and anthers.	2006	Plant J	GAMYB is a component of gibberellin (GA) signaling in cereal aleurone cells, and has an important role in flower development. However, it is unclear how GAMYB function is regulated. We examined the involvement of a microRNA, miR159, in the regulation of GAMYB expression in cereal aleurone cells and flower development. In aleurone cells, no miR159 expression was observed with or without GA treatment, suggesting that miR159 is not involved in the regulation of GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes in this tissue. miR159 was expressed in tissues other than aleurone, and miR159 over-expressors showed similar but more severe phenotypes than the gamyb mutant. GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are co-expressed with miR159 in anthers, and the mRNA levels for GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are negatively correlated with miR159 levels during anther development. Thus, OsGAMYB and OsGAMYB-like genes are regulated by miR159 in flowers. A microarray analysis revealed that OsGAMYB and its upstream regulator SLR1 are involved in the regulation of almost all GA-mediated gene expression in rice aleurone cells. Moreover, different sets of genes are regulated by GAMYB in aleurone cells and anthers. GAMYB binds directly to promoter regions of its target genes in anthers as well as aleurone cells. Based on these observations, we suggest that the regulation of GAMYB expression and GAMYB function are different in aleurone cells and flowers in rice.
10712532	A novel gibberellin-induced gene from rice and its potential regulatory role in stem growth.	2000	Plant Physiol	Os-GRF1 (Oryza sativa-GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1) was identified in a search for genes that are differentially expressed in the intercalary meristem of deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) internodes in response to gibberellin (GA). Os-GRF1 displays general features of transcription factors, contains a functional nuclear localization signal, and has three regions with similarities to sequences in the database. One of these regions is similar to a protein interaction domain of SWI2/SNF2, which is a subunit of a chromatin-remodeling complex in yeast. The two other domains are novel and found only in plant proteins of unknown function. To study its role in plant growth, Os-GRF1 was expressed in Arabidopsis. Stem elongation of transformed plants was severely inhibited, and normal growth could not be recovered by the application of GA. Our results indicate that Os-GRF1 belongs to a novel class of plant proteins and may play a regulatory role in GA-induced stem elongation.
16741739	Fine mapping of the qCTS12 locus, a major QTL for seedling cold tolerance in rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	The temperate japonica rice cultivar M202 is the predominant variety grown in California due to its tolerance to low temperature stress, good grain quality and high yield. Earlier analysis of a recombinant inbred line mapping population derived from a cross between M202 and IR50, an indica cultivar that is highly sensitive to cold stress, resulted in the identification of a number of QTL conferring tolerance to cold-induced wilting and necrosis. A major QTL, qCTS12, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, contributes over 40% of the phenotypic variance. To identify the gene(s) underlying qCTS12, we have undertaken the fine mapping of this locus. Saturating the short arm of chromosome 12 with microsatellite markers revealed that qCTS12 is closest to RM7003. Using RM5746 and RM3103, which are immediately outside of RM7003, we screened 1,954 F(5)-F(10) lines to find recombinants in the qCTS12 region. Additional microsatellite markers were identified from publicly available genomic sequence and used to fine map qCTS12 to a region of approximately 87 kb located on the BAC clone OSJNBb0071I17. This region contains ten open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of five hypothetical and expressed proteins of unknown function, a transposon protein, a putative NBS-LRR disease resistance protein, two zeta class glutathione S-transferases (OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2), and a DAHP synthetase. Further fine mapping with markers developed from the ORFs delimited the QTL to a region of about 55 kb. The most likely candidates for the gene(s) underlying qCTS12 are OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2.
8628242	Abnormal cell divisions in leaf primordia caused by the expression of the rice homeobox gene OSH1 lead to altered morphology of leaves in transgenic tobacco.	1996	Mol Gen Genet	Transgenic tobacco plants were generated carrying a rice homeobox gene, OSH1, controlled by the promoter of a gene encoding a tobacco pathogenesis-related protein (PR1a). These lines were morphologically abnormal, with wrinkled and/or lobed leaves. Histological analysis of shoot apex primordia indicates arrest of lateral leaf blade expansion, often resulting in asymmetric and anisotrophic growth of leaf blades. Other notable abnormalities included abnormal or arrested development of leaf lateral veins. Interestingly, OHS1 expression was undetectable in mature leaves with the aberrant morphological features. Thus, OSH1 expression in mature leaves is not necessary for abnormal leaf development. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that PR1a-OSH1 is expressed only in the shoot apical meristem and in very young leaf primordia. Therefore, the aberrant morphological features are an indirect consequence of ectopic OSH1 gene expression. The only abnormality observed in tissues expressing the transgene was periclinal (rather than anticlinal) division in mesophyll cells during leaf blade initiation. This generates thicker leaf blades and disrupts the mesophyll cell layers, from which vascular tissues differentiate. The OSH1 product appears to affect the mechanism controlling the orientation of the plane of cell division, resulting in abnormal periclinal division of mesophyll cell, which in turn results in the gross morphological abnormalities observed in the transgenic lines.
12428000	The procambium specification gene Oshox1 promotes polar auxin transport capacity and reduces its sensitivity toward inhibition.	2002	Plant Physiol	The auxin-inducible homeobox gene Oshox1 of rice (Oryza sativa) is a positive regulator of procambial cell fate commitment, and its overexpression reduces the sensitivity of polar auxin transport (PAT) to the PAT inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). Here, we show that wild-type rice leaves formed under conditions of PAT inhibition display vein hypertrophy, reduced distance between longitudinal veins, and increased distance between transverse veins, providing experimental evidence for a role of PAT in vascular patterning in a monocot species. Furthermore, we show that Oshox1 overexpression confers insensitivity to these PAT inhibitor-induced vascular-patterning defects. Finally, we show that in the absence of any overt phenotypical change, Oshox1 overexpression specifically reduces the affinity of the NPA-binding protein toward NPA and enhances PAT and its sensitivity toward auxin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Oshox1 promotes fate commitment of procambial cells by increasing their auxin conductivity properties and stabilizing this state against modulations of PAT by an endogenous NPA-like molecule.
15803416	Characterization of the genomic structures and selective expression profiles of nine class I small heat shock protein genes clustered on two chromosomes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Plant Mol Biol	The cytosolic class I small heat shock proteins (sHSP-CI) represent the most abundant sHSP in plants. Here, we report the characterization and the expression profile of nine members of the sHSP-CI gene family in rice (Oryza sativa Tainung No.67), of which Oshsp16.9A, Oshsp16.9B, Oshsp16.9C, Oshsp16.9D and Oshsp17.9B are clustered on chromosome 1, and Oshsp17.3, Oshsp17.7, Oshsp17.9A and Oshsp18.0 are clustered on chromosome 3. Oshsp17.3 and Oshsp18.0 are linked by a 356-bp putative bi-directional promoter. Individual gene products were identified from the protein subunits of a heat shock complex (HSC) and from in vitro transcription/ translation products by two-dimensional gel electrophoreses (2-DE). All sHSP-CI genes except Oshsp17.9B were induced strongly after a 2-h heat shock treatment. The genes on chromosome 3 were induced rapidly at 32 and 41 degrees C, whereas those on chromosome 1 were induced slowly by similar conditions. Seven of these genes, except Oshsp16.9D and Oshsp17.9B, were induced by arsenite (As), but only genes on chromosome 3 were strongly induced by azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze, a proline analog) and cadmium (Cd). A similar expression profile of all sHSP-CI genes at a lower level was evoked by ethanol, H2O2 and CuCl2 treatments. Transient expression assays of the promoter activity by linking to GUS reporter gene also supported the in vivo selective expression of the sHSP-CI genes by Aze treatment indicating the differential induction of rice sHSP-CI genes is most likely regulated at the transcriptional level. Only Oshsp16.9A abundantly accumulated in mature dry seed also suggested additionally prominent roles played by this HSP in development.
12650620	Molecular characterization of rice hsp101: complementation of yeast hsp104 mutation by disaggregation of protein granules and differential expression in indica and japonica rice types.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	HSP100 protein is an important component of the heat-shock response in diverse organisms. Using specific primers based on cDNA sequence, rice hsp101 gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced. Southern analysis revealed that there appears to be a single gene per haploid genome coding for HSP101 protein in rice. Northern analysis showed that expression of hsp101 transcript is strictly heat-inducible and induction is transient in nature. In the temperature regime tested, 45 degrees C treatment to intact rice seedlings for 2 h showed maximal levels of hsp101 mRNA. Rice full-length hsp101 cDNA complemented yeast mutant disrupted for its own hsp104 gene by insertional mutagenesis, with efficacy that was comparable with Arabidopsis hsp101 cDNA. Electron micrographic evidence suggested that rice hsp101 cDNA in yeast is active in re-solubilizing the stress-induced protein granules in the post-stress recovery period. Rice hsp101 cDNA expression in hsp104 deficient yeast also caused recovery in tolerance against arsenite. Western analyses showed that this protein is expressed more rapidly during the stress period and retained for longer duration in the post-stress recovery period in japonica rice as compared to indica rice types. This is the first report wherein plant HSP100 protein expression is correlated to disappearance of protein granules in the yeast cells and distinct rice type-dependent protein expression patterns are reported.
16500989	An insight into the molecular basis of salt tolerance of L-myo-inositol 1-P synthase (PcINO1) from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, a halophytic wild rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	The molecular basis of salt tolerance of L-myo-inositol 1-P synthase (MIPS; EC 5.5.1.4) from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka (PcINO1, AF412340) earlier reported from this laboratory, has been analyzed by in vitro mutant and hybrid generation and subsequent biochemical and biophysical studies of the recombinant proteins. A 37-amino acid stretch between Trp-174 and Ser-210 has been confirmed as the salt-tolerance determinant domain in PcINO1 both by loss or gain of salt tolerance by either deletion or by addition to salt-sensitive MIPS(s) of Oryza (OsINO1) and Brassica juncea (BjINO1). This was further verified by growth analysis under salt environment of Schizosaccharomyces pombe transformed with the various gene constructs and studies on the differential behavior of mutant and wild proteins by Trp fluorescence, aggregation, and circular dichroism spectra in the presence of salt. 4,4'-Dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5-disulfonic acid binding experiments revealed a lower hydrophobic surface on PcINO1 than OsINO1, contributed by this 37-amino acid stretch explaining the differential behavior of OsINO1 and PcINO1 both with respect to their enzymatic functions and thermodynamic stability in high salt environment. Detailed amino acid sequence comparison and modeling studies revealed the interposition of polar and charged residues and a well-connected hydrogen-bonding network formed by Ser and Thr in this stretch of PcINO1. On the contrary, hydrophobic residues clustered in two continuous stretches in the corresponding region of OsINO1 form a strong hydrophobic patch on the surface. It is conceivable that salt-tolerant MIPS proteins may be designed out of the salt-sensitive plant MIPS proteins by replacement of the corresponding amino acid stretch by the designated 37-amino acid stretch of PcINO1.
16861569	Ectopic expression of KNOTTED1-like homeobox protein induces expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Some phytohormones such as gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs) are potential targets of the KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) protein. To enhance our understanding of KNOX protein function in plant development, we identified rice (Oryza sativa) genes for adenosine phosphate isopentenyltransferase (IPT), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of CK biosynthesis. Molecular and biochemical studies revealed that there are eight IPT genes, OsIPT1 to OsIPT8, in the rice genome, including a pseudogene, OsIPT6. Overexpression of OsIPTs in transgenic rice inhibited root development and promoted axillary bud growth, indicating that OsIPTs are functional in vivo. Phenotypes of OsIPT overexpressers resembled those of KNOX-overproducing transgenic rice, although OsIPT overexpressers did not form roots or ectopic meristems, both of which are observed in KNOX overproducers. Expression of two OsIPT genes, OsIPT2 and OsIPT3, was up-regulated in response to the induction of KNOX protein function with similar kinetics to those of down-regulation of GA 20-oxidase genes, target genes of KNOX proteins in dicots. However, expression of these two OsIPT genes was not regulated in a feedback manner. These results suggest that OsIPT2 and OsIPT3 have unique roles in the developmental process, which is controlled by KNOX proteins, rather than in the maintenance of bioactive CK levels in rice. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that KNOX protein simultaneously decreases GA biosynthesis and increases de novo CK biosynthesis through the induction of OsIPT2 and OsIPT3 expression, and the resulting high-CK and low-GA condition is required for formation and maintenance of the meristem.
15618430	Complementation of sugary-1 phenotype in rice endosperm with the wheat isoamylase1 gene supports a direct role for isoamylase1 in amylopectin biosynthesis.	2005	Plant Physiol	To examine the role of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in amylopectin biosynthesis in plants, a genomic DNA fragment from Aegilops tauschii was introduced into the ISA1-deficient rice (Oryza sativa) sugary-1 mutant line EM914, in which endosperm starch is completely replaced by phytoglycogen. A. tauschii is the D genome donor of wheat (Triticum aestivum), and the introduced fragment effectively included the gene for ISA1 for wheat (TaISA1) that was encoded on the D genome. In TaISA1-expressing rice endosperm, phytoglycogen synthesis was substantially replaced by starch synthesis, leaving only residual levels of phytoglycogen. The levels of residual phytoglycogen present were inversely proportional to the expression level of the TaISA1 protein, although the level of pullulanase that had been reduced in EM914 was restored to the same level as that in the wild type. Small but significant differences were found in the amylopectin chain-length distribution, gelatinization temperatures, and A-type x-ray diffraction patterns of the starches from lines expressing TaISA1 when compared with wild-type rice starch, although in the first two parameters, the effect was proportional to the expression level of TaISA. The impact of expression levels of ISA1 on starch structure and properties provides support for the view that ISA1 is directly involved in the synthesis of amylopectin.
10364408	Expression of a gibberellin-induced leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase in deepwater rice and its interaction with kinase-associated protein phosphatase.	1999	Plant Physiol	We identified in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like transmembrane protein kinase, OsTMK (O. sativa transmembrane kinase). The transcript levels of OsTMK increased in the rice internode in response to gibberellin. Expression of OsTMK was especially high in regions undergoing cell division and elongation. The kinase domain of OsTMK was enzymatically active, autophosphorylating on serine and threonine residues. A cDNA encoding a rice ortholog of a kinase-associated type 2C protein phosphatase (OsKAPP) was cloned. KAPPs are putative downstream components in kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways. The kinase interaction domain of OsKAPP was phosphorylated in vitro by the kinase domain of OsTMK. RNA gel-blot analysis indicated that the expression of OsTMK and OsKAPP was similar in different tissues of the rice plant. In protein-binding assays, OsKAPP interacted with a receptor-like protein kinase, RLK5 of Arabidopsis, but not with the protein kinase domains of the rice and maize receptor-like protein kinases Xa21 and ZmPK1, respectively.
15604716	Different subcellular localization and trafficking properties of KNOX class 1 homeodomain proteins from rice.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Genes of the KN1-like homeobox (KNOX) class 1 encode transcription factors involved in shoot apical meristem development and maintenance. We studied the subcellular localization of Green Fluorescent Protein-tagged rice KNOX proteins (Oskn1-3) after particle bombardment of onion and rice cells and after transformation of Arabidopsis and rice with constitutive and inducible expression constructs. In all test systems, the three rice KNOX proteins showed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization patterns. However, Oskn1 additionally showed in some cells a distribution over punctae moving randomly in the cytosol. Use of an inducible expression system indicated a nuclear presence of Oskn1 in cells of the shoot apical meristem and post-transcriptional down-regulation in early leaf primordia. Arabidopsis and rice test systems were used to study effects of plant hormones and auxin transport inhibition on KNOX protein localization. Application of GA3 or 1-NAA shifted protein localization completely to the cytoplasm and resulted in loss of the punctae formed by Oskn1. Conversely, NPA application induced a complete nuclear localization of the KNOX proteins. To study intercellular movement of the KNOX proteins we set up a novel co-bombardment assay in which trafficking of untagged KNOX proteins was visualized through the co-trafficking of green fluorescent or blue fluorescent marker proteins. In multiple independent experiments Oskn1 trafficked more extensively to neighboring cells than Oskn2 and Oskn3. Differences in the localization and trafficking properties of Oskn1, Oskn2 and Oskn3 correlate with differences in mRNA localization patterns and functional differences between the rice KNOX genes and their putative orthologues from other species.
11908517	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	Plant homeobox genes of the class 1 knox (knotted1-like) type are involved in the regulation of shoot apical meristem formation and function. Their expression generally occurs either throughout the meristem or specifically at the lateral organ boundaries. Down-regulation in the organ primordia is tightly controlled and misexpression in leaves leads to a perturbed development. Here, the transcriptional control of two rice knox genes, Oskn2 and Oskn3, was addressed, showing that the promoter sequences of both genes mediate the initial down-regulation during lateral organ formation, but are insufficient to keep expression in lateral organs stably off. Therefore, maintenance of the repressed state requires control elements outside the promoter regions. Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching. internode elongation and leaf patterning. However, small differences suggested that their target gene specificities are not completely overlapping. This was supported by the observation that Oskn3 protein but not Oskn2 could interact with two reported recognition sequences of a KNOX protein from barley. Finally, protein-protein interactions may contribute to the functioning of KNOX proteins, as the ability of Oskn3 and Oskn2 to form heterodimers could be demonstrated.
11197326	Two rice MADS domain proteins interact with OsMADS1.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	OsMADS1 is a MADS box gene controlling flower development in rice. In order to learn more about the function of OsMADS1, we searched for cellular proteins interacting with OsMADS1 employing the yeast two-hybrid system. Two novel proteins with MADS domains, which were named OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, were isolated from a rice cDNA library. OsMADS14 and -15 are highly homologous to the maize MADS box gene ZAP1 which is an orthologue of the floral homeotic gene APETALA1 (AP1). Interactions among the three MADS domain proteins were confirmed by in vitro experiments using GST-fused OsMADS1 expressed in Escherichia coli and in vitro translated proteins of OsMADS14 and -15. We determined which domains in OsMADS1, -14, and -15 were required for protein-protein interaction employing the two-hybrid system and pull-down experiments. While the K domain was essential for protein-protein interaction, a region preceded by the K domain augmented this interaction. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of OsMADS1 functioned as a transcriptional activation domain in yeast and mammalian cells, while, on the other hand, the C domains of OsMADS14 and -15 exhibited only very weak transcriptional activator functionality, if any at all.
16217607	Conservation of the E-function for floral organ identity in rice revealed by the analysis of tissue culture-induced loss-of-function mutants of the OsMADS1 gene.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	Rapid progress in studies on flower development has resulted in refining the classical 'ABC model' into a new 'ABCDE model' to explain properly the regulation of floral organ identity. Conservation of E-function for flower organ identity among the dicotyledonous (dicot) plants has been revealed. However, its conservation in monocotyledonous (monocot) plants remains largely unknown. Here, we show the conservation of E-function in rice (Oryza sativaL.) by characterizing tissue culture-induced mutants of two MADS-box genes, OsMADS1and OsMADS5, which form a subclade within the well-supported clade of SEP-genes (E-function) phylogeny. Severe loss-of-function mutations of OsMADS1cause complete homeotic conversion of organs (lodicules, stamens, and carpels) of three inner whorls into lemma- and palea-like structures. Such basic deformed structure is reiterated along with the pedicel at the center of the same floret, indicating the loss of determinacy of the flower meristem. These phenotypes resemble the phenotypes caused by mutations of the dicot E-class genes, such as the Arabidopsis SEP123(SEPALLATA1/2/3) and the petunia FBP2(Floral Binding Protein 2), suggesting that OsMADS1play a very similar role in rice to that of defined E-class genes in dicot plants. In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed. These results demonstrate that OsMADS1clearly possesses E-function, and so, E-function is fundamentally conserved between dicot plants and rice, a monocot model plant.
14558657	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	The rice OsMADS16 gene is phylogenetically related to the angiosperm B-function MADS-box genes. To investigate if OsMADS16 functions as an AP3/DEF orthologue to regulate the development of lodicules and stamens in rice, we isolated its genomic sequences and characterized its functions in planta by RNA interference. The genomic sequence of the OsMADS16 gene shows that it shares high similarity in genomic structure and the deduced amino acid sequence with the maize B-class gene, Si1. Transgenic lines from the introduced gene expressing double-stranded RNA with the OsMADS16 cDNA fragment were male-sterile and displayed alternations of lodicules and stamens, occasionally depressed palea and overgrown glume. The two lodicules were converted into four palea/lemma-like organs and some stamens into carpels. Further investigations of the transcription of OsMADS16 gene in these transgenic lines by RT-PCR revealed that its transcript was significantly reduced. Transcription of a rice PI homologous gene, OsMADS4, was also reduced remarkably in the transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate that OsMADS16 is an AP3/DEF orthologue to specify the identities of lodicules and stamens in rice flower and also support that OsMADS4 is a PI orthologue. In addition, these results suggest that RNA interference is a useful tool for functional genomics in rice.
16927200	Molecular analysis of early rice stamen development using organ-specific gene expression profiling.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of plant organ formation is an important component of plant developmental biology and will be useful for crop improvement applications. Plant organ formation, or organogenesis, occurs when a group of primordial cells differentiates into an organ, through a well-orchestrated series of events, with a given shape, structure and function. Research over the past two decades has elucidated the molecular mechanisms of organ identity and dorsalventral axis determinations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the successive processes. To develop an effective approach for studying organ formation at the molecular level, we generated organ-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) reflecting early development in rice stamen. In this study, we demonstrated that the GEPs are highly correlated with early stamen development, suggesting that this analysis is useful for dissecting stamen development regulation. Based on the molecular and morphological correlation, we found that over 26 genes, that were preferentially up-regulated during early stamen development, may participate in stamen development regulation. In addition, we found that differentially expressed genes during early stamen development are clustered into two clades, suggesting that stamen development may comprise of two distinct phases of pattern formation and cellular differentiation. Moreover, the organ-specific quantitative changes in gene expression levels may play a critical role for regulating plant organ formation.
16861571	Genomic organization, differential expression, and interaction of SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like transcription factors and microRNA156 in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol	Transcription factors play essential roles in the developmental processes of plants. Many such factors are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). SQUAMOSA (SQUA) promoter-binding-like (SPL) genes encode plant-specific transcription factors, some of which contain complementary sequences of miRNA156. In this study, 19 rice (Oryza sativa) SPL (OsSPL) genes and 12 rice miRNA156 (OsmiR156) precursors were identified in the rice genome. Sequence and experimental analysis suggested that 11 OsSPL genes were putative targets of OsmiR156. Plant SPL proteins were classified into six subgroups based on the phylogenetic analysis of SQUA promoter-binding protein domain. Diverse exon-intron structures and distinct organizations of putative motifs beyond the SQUA promoter-binding protein domains were identified in the OsSPL gene family. Transcript level analysis of OsSPL genes in various rice tissues and organs revealed different tempospatial expression patterns. More than half of the OsSPL genes including most OsmiR156-targeted genes are predominantly expressed in the young panicles, whereas OsmiR156 genes are predominantly expressed in the young shoots and leaves of rice. Overexpression of two OsmiR156 genes (OsmiR156b and OsmiR156h) in rice resulted in severe dwarfism, strongly reduced panicle size, and delayed flowering, suggesting that OsmiR156 and OsSPL target genes are involved in various developmental processes, especially the flower development of rice. Different patterns of transcript changes (decreased or unchanged) of different target genes in same tissue and of same target gene in different tissues detected in the OsmiR156-overexpressing plants suggested diverse interactions between OsmiR156 and OsSPL target genes in a tissue-specific manner.
12436254	A transcriptionally active maize MuDR-like transposable element in rice and its relatives.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	Two Mu-like transposable elements were cloned from a rice genomic library using a partial cDNA clone that exhibits high homology to the mudrA gene of the maize element MuDR. Database searches led to the identification of six other sequences that carried highly homologous terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). All the rice elements possessed approximately 200-bp TIRs, and four were flanked by 9-bp target-site duplications (TSDs). The longer of the two cloned elements, OsMu4-2, could potentially encode a protein colinear with a MURA-like transposase, but it had stop codons in the coding region indicating that it is a pseudogene. All the other elements had large internal deletions. Direct dinucleotide repeats were found in two elements at positions flanking the deleted regions, suggesting that the deletions arose via the interrupted-gap-repair mechanism. Sequences related to empty sites of insertion were found in OsMu4-2 and one of the elements identified in the databases. These results provide evidence that the rice OsMu element was active and transposed in the past. Analysis of OsMu4-2 cDNAs revealed two types of transcripts produced by alternative splicing. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that OsMu4-2 was conserved in rice species with the A genome, but a deleted version was unique to japonica subspecies. Some wild rice species harbored paralogous copies of the OsMu element.
11867229	Effects of signaling molecules, protein phosphatase inhibitors and blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) on the mRNA level of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (OsPHGPX) gene in seedling leaves.	2002	Gene	With a specific focus on rice self-defense response(s), the effects of global signaling molecules, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (using the ethylene generator, ethephon), and protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, cantharidin and endothall on expression of a rice phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (OsPHGPX) gene in rice seedling leaves were investigated. We provide first evidence for a potent up-regulation of the OsPHGPX mRNA accumulation by these signaling molecules and PP inhibitors that strongly suggest its potential role in defense/stress. The OsPHGPX gene also showed a weak constitutive expression and responsiveness to cut. These inductions were influenced by light signal(s), and did not show a requirement for de novo synthesized protein factor(s). A potential interaction amongst these signaling molecules, especially JA, SA, ABA and kinetin, in modulating the OsPHGPX expression was found. The blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea also elicited the accumulation of OsPHGPX mRNA in leaves. This is a first systematic report in rice (and in plants) demonstrating the inducible nature (and expression) of the OsPHGPX gene by a variety of defense/stress-related stimuli, and modulation by the PPs of the kinase-signaling cascade(s).
12805623	Identification and expression analysis of a gene encoding a bacterial-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Arabidopsis and rice.	2003	Plant Physiol	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is distributed in plants and bacteria but is not found in fungi and animal cells. Important motifs for enzyme activity and structure are conserved in plant and bacterial PEPCs, with the exception of a phosphorylation domain present at the N terminus of all plant PEPCs reported so far, which is absent in the bacterial enzymes. Here, we describe a gene from Arabidopsis, stated as Atppc4, encoding a PEPC, which shows more similarity to Escherichia coli than to plant PEPCs. Interestingly, this enzyme lacks the phosphorylation domain, hence indicating that it is a bacterial-type PEPC. Three additional PEPC genes are present in Arabidopsis, stated as Atppc1, Atppc2, and Atppc3, encoding typical plant-type enzymes. As most plant PEPC genes, Atppc1, Atppc2, and Atppc3 are formed by 10 exons interrupted by nine introns. In contrast, Atppc4 gene has an unusual structure formed by 20 exons. A bacterial-type PEPC gene was also identified in rice (Oryza sativa), stated as Osppc-b, therefore showing the presence of this type of PEPC in monocots. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that both plant-type and bacterial-type PEPCs diverged early during the evolution of plants from a common ancestor, probably the PEPC from gamma-proteobacteria. The diversity of plant-type PEPCs in C3, C4, and Crassulacean acid metabolism plants is indicative of the evolutionary success of the regulation by phosphorylation of this enzyme. Although at a low level, the bacterial-type PEPC genes are expressed in Arabidopsis and rice.
11097833	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsPR1b gene is phytohormonally regulated in close interaction with light signals.	2000	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Strategies evolved by plants to counteract a variety of biotic/abiotic stresses include induction of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) protein, in particular the PR class 1 (PR1) gene family, widely used in stress response studies. In spite of its immense importance as a PR family member, and an accepted gene marker in plant disease/defense in dicots, little is known about rice PR1 genes. Recently, we cloned and characterized the first OsPR1a (rice acidic PR1) gene (Agrawal et al. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 274, 157-165). Here, we report characterization of a rice basic PR1 (OsPR1b) gene, identified from screening a cDNA library prepared from jasmonic acid (JA)-treated rice seedling leaf, providing detailed and valuable insights into rice PR1 gene expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsPR1b reveals only 63.1% homology with the OsPR1a protein, whereas Southern blot analyses indicate that OsPR1b is a multigene family. The JA-inducible OsPR1b gene was also up-regulated by salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and kinetin (KN). Furthermore, protein phosphatase inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN) strongly induced the OsPR1b transcript. However, OsPR1b was not cut-responsive, diagrammatically opposite to cut inducibility of OsPR1a. This induction was light-, time-, and dose-dependent, as demonstrated by using, JA, CN, and EN, and completely inhibited by cycloheximide, but not by tetracycline. The simultaneous application of SA, and ABA, with JA, respectively, showed almost complete inhibition of the JA-induced OsPR1b transcript by 200 microM SA or ABA, but not by 100 microM concentrated solutions, suggesting a potential interaction among JA, SA, and ABA, whereas KN dramatically enhanced JA-induced OsPR1b transcript upon simultaneous application. Moreover, a simultaneous application of staurosporine enhances JA-, CN-, and EN-induced OsPR1b transcript, in particular with CN. Finally, a comparative analysis with the OsPR1a gene gives us insight into the differential regulation of the PR1 gene family, while proposing OsPR1 genes as important gene markers in rice, with potential use(s) in analyzing plant defense responses.
16172097	RNA silencing of single and multiple members in a gene family of rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	RNA silencing with inverted repeat (IR) constructs has been used to suppress gene expression in various organisms. However, the transitive RNA-silencing effect described in plants may preclude the use of RNA silencing for a gene family. Here, we show that, in rice (Oryza sativa), transitive RNA silencing (spreading of double-stranded RNA along the target mRNA) occurred with the green fluorescent protein transgene but not with the endogenous phytoene desaturase gene. We fused IR copies of unique 3' untranslated regions derived from the rice OsRac gene family to a strong promoter and stably introduced them into rice. Each of the seven members of the OsRac gene family was specifically suppressed by its respective IR construct. We also examined IR constructs in which multiple 3' untranslated regions were fused and showed that three members of the OsRac gene family were effectively suppressed by a single construct. Using highly conserved regions of the two members of the OsRac gene family, we also suppressed the expression of all members of the gene family with variable efficiencies. These results suggest that RNA silencing is a useful method for the functional analysis of gene families in rice and other plants.
16531052	Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice.	2006	Plant Physiol Biochem	The rice genome contains at least seven expressed Rop small GTPase genes. Of these Rops, OsRac1 is the only characterized gene that has been implicated in disease resistance as a positive regulator. To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a "phylogeny of function" approach to rice Rops, and identified OsRacB based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance. To determine the function of OsRacB, we isolated the OsRacB cDNA and conducted gene expression and transgenic studies. OsRacB, a single copy gene in the genome of rice, shared 98% identity with HvRacB at the amino acid level. Its mRNA was strongly expressed in leaf sheath (LS) and in panicles, but was very weakly expressed in young and mature leaves. The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid. A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP):OsRacB-transformed onion cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts revealed OsRacB association with plasma membrane (PM), suggesting that PM localization is required for proper function of OsRacB. Based on these results, we suggest that OsRacB functions as a potential regulator for a basal disease resistance pathway in rice.
17052323	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis.	2006	Plant J	SPINDLY (SPY) encodes an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase that is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA) signaling through an unknown mechanism. To understand the function of SPY in GA signaling in rice, we isolated a rice SPINDLY homolog (OsSPY) and produced knockdown transgenic plants in which OsSPY expression was reduced by introducing its antisense or RNAi construct. In knockdown plants, the enhanced elongation of lower internodes was correlated with decreased levels of OsSPY expression, similar to the spindly phenotype of Arabidopsis spy mutants, suggesting that OsSPY also functions as a negative factor in GA signaling in rice. The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function. The suppression of OsSPY function in a GA-insensitive mutant, gid2, also caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, but did not change the amount of SLR1. This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1. In addition to the GA-related phenotypes, OsSPY antisense and RNAi plants showed increased lamina joint bending, which is a brassinosteroid-related phenotype, indicating that OsSPY may play roles both in GA signaling and in the brassinosteroid pathway.
10982424	Sugar uptake and transport in rice embryo. Expression of companion cell-specific sucrose transporter (OsSUT1) induced by sugar and light.	2000	Plant Physiol	We investigated sugar uptake and transport in rice (Oryza sativa) embryo during grain germination. Endogenous sugar levels, accumulation of starch granules, and gene expression of a rice sucrose transporter (OsSUT1) were examined using rice embryos germinated with or without exogenous sugar supply. Starch granules remarkably accumulated in the cells around vascular bundles as a consequence of the sugar taken up by the embryos, indicating that the taken-up sugars are transiently converted into starch. In situ detection for OsSUT1 mRNA indicated its localization in the phloem companion cells. Furthermore, northern-blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsSUT1 expression is not detectable in embryos subjected to sugar starvation conditions, whereas its expression is enhanced by an increased endogenous sugar level. Overall results indicate that the expression of companion cell-specific sucrose transporter, OsSUT1 is regulated by the endogenous sugar status as well as light exposure.
10889249	Tissue-preferential expression of a rice alpha-tubulin gene, OsTubA1, mediated by the first intron.	2000	Plant Physiol	The genomic clone encoding an alpha-tubulin, OsTubA1, has been isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The gene consists of four exons and three introns. RNA-blot analysis showed that the gene is strongly expressed in actively dividing tissues, including root tips, young leaves, and young flowers. Analysis of chimeric fusions between OsTubA1 and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) revealed that the intron 1 was required for high-level GUS expression in actively dividing tissues, corresponding with normal expression pattern of OsTubA1. Fusion constructs lacking the intron 1 showed more GUS staining in mature tissues rather than young tissues. When the intron 1 was placed at the distal region from 5'-upstream region or at the 3'-untranslated region, no enhancement of GUS expression was observed. Sequential deletions of the OsTubA1 intron 1 brought about a gradual reduction of GUS activity in calli. These results suggest that tissue-preferential expression of the OsTubA1 gene is mediated by the intron 1 and that it may be involved in a mechanism for an efficient RNA splicing that is position dependent.
16286450	Evolutionary expansion, gene structure, and expression of the rice wall-associated kinase gene family.	2005	Plant Physiol	The wall-associated kinase (WAK) gene family, one of the receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene families in plants, plays important roles in cell expansion, pathogen resistance, and heavy-metal stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Through a reiterative database search and manual reannotation, we identified 125 OsWAK gene family members from rice (Oryza sativa) japonica cv Nipponbare; 37 (approximately 30%) OsWAKs were corrected/reannotated from earlier automated annotations. Of the 125 OsWAKs, 67 are receptor-like kinases, 28 receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, 13 receptor-like proteins, 12 short genes, and five pseudogenes. The two-intron gene structure of the Arabidopsis WAK/WAK-Likes is generally conserved in OsWAKs; however, extra/missed introns were observed in some OsWAKs either in extracellular regions or in protein kinase domains. In addition to the 38 OsWAKs with full-length cDNA sequences and the 11 with rice expressed sequence tag sequences, gene expression analyses, using tiling-microarray analysis of the 20 OsWAKs on chromosome 10 and reverse transcription-PCR analysis for five OsWAKs, indicate that the majority of identified OsWAKs are likely expressed in rice. Phylogenetic analyses of OsWAKs, Arabidopsis WAK/WAK-Likes, and barley (Hordeum vulgare) HvWAKs show that the OsWAK gene family expanded in the rice genome due to lineage-specific expansion of the family in monocots. Localized gene duplications appear to be the primary genetic event in OsWAK gene family expansion and the 125 OsWAKs, present on all 12 chromosomes, are mostly clustered.
16623886	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells.	2006	Plant J	Gibberellins (GA) promote while abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits seed germination and post-germination growth. To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells. Over-expression of these two genes in aleurone cells specifically and synergistically represses induction of the ABA-repressible and GA-inducible Amy32b alpha-amylase promoter reporter construct (Amy32b-GUS) by GA or the GA-inducible transcriptional activator, GAMYB. The physical interactions of OsWRKY71 proteins themselves and that of OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY51 are revealed in the nuclei of aleurone cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Although OsWRKY51 itself does not bind to the Amy32b promoter in vitro, it interacts with OsWRKY71 and enhances the binding affinity of OsWRKY71 to W boxes in the Amy32b promoter. The binding activity of OsWRKY71 is abolished by deleting the C-terminus containing the WRKY domain or substituting the key amino acids in the WRKY motif and the zinc finger region. However, two of these non-DNA-binding mutants are still able to repress GA induction by enhancing the binding affinity of the wild-type DNA-binding OsWRKY71 repressors. In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex. These data demonstrate the synergistic interaction of ABA-inducible WRKY genes in regulating GAMYB-mediated GA signaling in aleurone cells, thereby establishing a novel mechanism for ABA and GA signaling cross-talk.
10712549	Characterization of XET-related genes of rice.	2000	Plant Physiol	To elucidate the mechanism of internodal elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we analyzed genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET), a cell wall-loosening enzyme essential for cell elongation. Four rice XET-related (XTR) genes, OsXTR1, OsXTR2, OsXTR3, and OsXTR4, were isolated and their expression patterns in rice plants determined. The expression of the four XTR genes showed different patterns of organ specificity and responses to several plant hormones. OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were up-regulated by gibberellin and brassinosteroids, whereas OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 showed no clear response to these hormones. Expression of the four XTR genes was also investigated in elongating internodes at different developmental stages. OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 were preferentially expressed in the elongating zone of internodes, while OsXTR2 and OsXTR4 were expressed in nodes and in the divisional and elongating zones of internodes. In three genetic mutants with abnormal heights, the expression of OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 correlated with the height of the mutants, whereas no such correlation was observed for OsXTR2 and OsXTR4. Based on these observations, we discuss the roles that OsXTR1 and OsXTR3 may play in internodal elongation in rice.
15604733	Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Members in the YABBY gene family of proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that play critical roles in determining organ polarity. We have isolated a cDNA clone from rice that encodes a YABBY protein. This protein, OsYAB1, is similar to Arabidopsis YAB2 (50.3%) and YAB5 (47.6%). It carries a zinc-finger motif and a YABBY domain, as do those in Arabidopsis . A fusion protein between OsYAB1 and GFP is located in the nucleus. RNA gel-blot analysis showed that the OsYAB1 gene is preferentially expressed in flowers. In-situ hybridization experiments also indicated that the transcript accumulated in the stamen and carpel primordia. Unlike the Arabidopsis YABBY genes, however, the OsYAB1 gene does not show polar expression pattern in the tissues of floral organs. Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures. Spikelets contained supernumerary stamens and carpels compared with those of the wild types. These results suggest that OsYAB1 plays a major role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels, rather than in determining polarity.
12111554	Two broad-spectrum blast resistance genes, Pi9( t) and Pi2( t), are physically linked on rice chromosome 6.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	To understand the molecular basis of broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, fine-scale mapping of the two blast resistance (R) genes, Pi9( t) and Pi2( t), was conducted. These two genes were introgressed from different resistance donors, previously reported to confer resistance to many blast isolates in the Philippines, and were mapped to an approximately 10-cM interval on chromosome 6. To further test their resistance spectrum, 43 blast isolates collected from 13 countries were used to inoculate the Pi2( t) and Pi9( t) plants. Pi9( t)-bearing lines were highly resistant to all isolates tested, and lines carrying Pi2( t) were resistant to 36 isolates, confirming the broad-spectrum resistance of these two genes to diverse blast isolates. Three RAPD markers tightly linked to Pi9( t) were identified using the bulk segregant analysis technique. Twelve positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were identified and a BAC contig covering about 100 kb was constructed when the Pi9( t) BAC library was screened with one of the markers. A high-resolution map of Pi9( t) was constructed using BAC ends. The Pi2( t) gene was tightly linked to all of the Pi9( t) markers in 450 F(2) plants. These data suggest that Pi9( t) and Pi2( t) are either allelic or tightly linked in an approximately 100-kb region. The mapping results for Pi9( t) and Pi2( t) provide essential information for the positional cloning of these two important blast resistance genes in rice.
15856160	Genetic control of rice blast resistance in the durably resistant cultivar Gumei 2 against multiple isolates.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	To further our understanding of the genetic control of blast resistance in rice cultivar Gumei 2 and, consequently, to facilitate the utilization of this durably blast-resistant cultivar, we studied 304 recombinant inbred lines of indica rice cross Zhong 156/Gumei 2 and a linkage map comprising 181 markers. An analysis of segregation for resistance against five isolates of rice blast suggested that one gene cluster and three additional major genes that are independently inherited are responsible for the complete resistance of Gumei 2. The gene cluster was located to chromosome 6 and includes two genes mapped previously, Pi25(t), against Chinese rice blast isolate 92-183 (race ZC15) and Pi26(t) against Philippine rice blast isolate Ca89 (lineage 4), and a gene for resistance against Philippine rice blast isolate 92330-5 (lineage 17). Of the two genes conferring resistance against the Philippine isolates V86013 (lineage 15) and C923-39 (lineage 46), we identified one as Pi26(t) and mapped the other onto the distal end of chromosome 2 where Pib is located. We used three components of partial blast resistance, percentage diseased leaf area (DLA), lesion number and lesion size, all measured in the greenhouse, to measure the degree of susceptibility to isolates Ca89 and C923-39 and subsequently identified nine and eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), respectively. Epistasis was determined to play an important role in partial resistance against Ca89. Using DLA measured on lines susceptible in a blast nursery, we detected six QTLs. While different QTLs were detected for partial resistance to Ca89 and C923-39, respectively, most were involved in the partial resistance in the field. Our results suggest that the blast resistance in Gumei 2 is controlled by multiple major genes and minor genes with epistatic effects.
16151856	Genetic and physical mapping of Pi36(t), a novel rice blast resistance gene located on rice chromosome 8.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	Blast resistance in the indica cultivar (cv.) Q61 was inherited as a single dominant gene in two F2 populations, F2-1 and F2-2, derived from crosses between the donor cv. and two susceptible japonica cvs. Aichi Asahi and Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH), respectively. To rapidly determine the chromosomal location of the resistance (R) gene detected in Q61, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was performed in the F2-1 population using bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) in combination with recessive-class analysis (RCA). One of the three linked markers identified, BA1126(550), was cloned and sequenced. The R gene locus was roughly mapped on rice chromosome 8 by comparison of the BA1126(550) sequence with rice sequences in the databases (chromosome landing). To confirm this finding, seven known markers, including four sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers and three simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers flanking BA1126(550) on chromosome 8, were subjected to linkage analysis in the two F2 populations. The locus was mapped to a 5.8 cM interval bounded by RM5647 and RM8018 on the short arm of chromosome 8. This novel R gene is therefore tentatively designated as Pi36(t). For fine mapping of the Pi36(t) locus, five additional markers including one STS marker and four candidate resistance gene (CRG) markers were developed in the target region, based on the genomic sequence of the corresponding region of the reference japonica cv. Nipponbare. The Pi36(t) locus was finally localized to an interval of about 0.6 cM flanked by the markers RM5647 and CRG2, and co-segregated with the markers CRG3 and CRG4. To physically map this locus, the Pi36(t)-linked markers were mapped by electronic hybridization to bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones of Nipponbare, and a contig map was constructed in silico through Pairwise BLAST analysis. The Pi36(t) locus was physically delimited to an interval of about 17.0 kb, based on the genomic sequence of Nipponbare.
16189658	Genetic and physical mapping of Pi37(t), a new gene conferring resistance to rice blast in the famous cultivar St. No. 1.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	The famous rice cultivar (cv.), St. No. 1, confers complete resistance to many isolates collected from the South China region. To effectively utilize the resistance, a linkage assay using microsatellite markers (SSR) was performed in the three F2 populations derived from crosses between the donor cv. St. No. 1 and each of the three susceptible cvs. C101PKT, CO39 and AS20-1, which segregated into 3R:1S (resistant/susceptible) ratio, respectively. A total of 180 SSR markers selected from each chromosome equally were screened. The result showed that the two markers RM128 and RM486 located on chromosome 1 were linked to the resistance gene in the respective populations above. This result is not consistent with those previously reported, in which a well-known resistance gene Pif in the St. No. 1 is located on chromosome 11. To confirm this result, additional four SSR markers, which located in the region lanked by RM128 and RM486, were tested. The results showed that markers RM543 and RM319 were closer to, and RM302 and RM212 completely co-segregated with the resistance locus detected in the present study. These results indicated that another resistance gene involved in the St. No. 1, which is located on chromosome 1, and therefore tentatively designated as Pi37(t). To narrow down genomic region of the Pi37(t) locus, eight markers were newly developed in the target region through bioinformatics analysis (BIA) using the publicly available sequences. The linkage analysis with these markers showed that the Pi37(t) locus was mapped to a approximately 0.8 centimorgans (cM) interval flanked by RM543 and FPSM1, where a total of seven markers co-segregated with it. To physically map the locus, the Pi37(t)-linked markers were landed on the reference sequence of cv. Nipponbare through BIA. A contig map corresponding to the locus was constructed based on the reference sequence aligned by the Pi37(t)-linked markers. Consequently, the Pi37(t) locus was defined to 374 kb interval flanking markers RM543 and FPSM1, where only four candidate genes with the resistance gene conserved structure (NBS-LRR) were further identified to a DNA fragment of 60 kb in length by BIA.
12756540	Genetic and physical mapping of Pi5(t), a locus associated with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast.	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	To gain an understanding of the molecular basis for resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), we have initiated a project to clone Pi5(t), a locus associated with broad-spectrum resistance to diverse blast isolates. AFLP-derived markers linked to Pi5(t)-mediated resistance were isolated using bulked segregant analysis of F(2) populations generated by crossing three recombinant inbred lines (RILs), RIL125, RIL249, and RIL260 with the susceptible line CO39. The most tightly linked AFLP marker, S04G03, was positioned on chromosome 9 of the fingerprint-based physical map of Nipponbare, a well-characterized rice genotype. Flanking BAC-based Nipponbare markers were generated for saturation mapping using four populations, the three initial RILs and an additional one derived from a cross between M202 and RIL260. A BIBAC (binary BAC) library was constructed from RIL260. Using these resources Pi5(t) was mapped to a 170-kb interval, and a contiguous set of BIBAC clones spanning this region was constructed. It had previously been suggested that Pi3(t) and Pi5(t) might be allelic, due to their identical resistance spectrum and tight linkage. We therefore compared genomic regions for lines containing Pi3(t) using the Pi5(t)-linked markers. DNA gel-blot analyses indicated that the region around Pi3(t) is identical to that of Pi5(t), suggesting that Pi3(t) and Pi5(t) are the same resistance gene.
12172799	Genetic and physical mapping of a rice blast resistance locus, Pi-CO39(t), that corresponds to the avirulence gene AVR1-CO39 of Magnaporthe grisea.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	We have identified, genetically mapped and physically delineated the chromosomal location of a new rice blast resistance locus, designated Pi-CO39(t). This locus confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea isolates carrying the AVR1-CO39 avirulence locus. The AVR1-CO39 locus is conserved in non-rice (cereals and grasses)-infecting isolates of M. grisea, making Pi-CO39(t) useful for engineering M. grisea resistance in rice and other cereals. The resistance in the rice line CO39 was inherited as a single dominant locus in segregating populations derived from F(2) and F(3) crosses between disease-resistant (CO39) and susceptible (51583) rice genotypes. Microsatellite, RFLP and resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were used to map the Pi-CO39(t) locus to a 1.2-cM interval between the probenazole-responsive ( RPR1) gene (0.2 cM) and RFLP marker S2712 (1.0 cM) on the short arm of rice chromosome 11. RFLP markers G320 and F5003, and resistance gene analogs RGA8, RGA38 and RGACO39 were tightly linked to the Pi-CO39(t) locus (no recombination detected in a sample of ~2400 gametes). A large-insert genomic library of CO39 was constructed in the binary plant transformation vector pCLD04541. A library screen using RGA8, RGA38 and probes derived from the ends of CO39 clones, as well as BAC end probes from the corresponding locus in the rice cv. Nipponbare, resulted in the assembly of three CO39 contigs of 180 kb, 110 kb and 145 kb linked to the Pi-CO39(t) locus. A 650-kb contig was also constructed representing the susceptible locus, pi-CO39(t), in the Nipponbare genome. The two genomes are highly divergent with respect to additions, deletions and translocations at the Pi-CO39(t) locus, as revealed by the presence or absence of mapping markers.
16709195	A B-lectin receptor kinase gene conferring rice blast resistance.	2006	Plant J	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. The dominant resistance gene, Pi-d2 [previously named Pi-d(t)2], present in the rice variety Digu, confers gene-for-gene resistance to the Chinese blast strain, ZB15. Pi-d2 was previously mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 6. In this study, the Pi-d2 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. Pi-d2 encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of a bulb-type mannose specific binding lectin (B-lectin) and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. Pi-d2 is a single-copy gene that is constitutively expressed in the rice variety Digu. Transgenic plants carrying the Pi-d2 transgene confer race-specific resistance to the M. grisea strain, ZB15. The Pi-d2 protein is plasma membrane localized. A single amino acid difference at position 441 of Pi-d2 distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2. Because of its novel extracellular domain, Pi-d2 represents a new class of plant resistance genes.
16791691	Development of PCR-based allele-specific and InDel marker sets for nine rice blast resistance genes.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Blast resistance is one of the most important traits in rice breeding, and application of molecular markers for blast resistance breeding is likely to allow the rapid screening for the trait during early growth stages, without the need for inoculation of pathogen and phenotyping. Allele-specific PCR markers and insertion/deletion (InDel) markers, which genotype single-nucleotide polymorphisms and InDel polymorphisms, respectively, are useful tools for marker-assisted selections. We developed sets of allele-specific PCR and InDel markers for nine rice blast resistance genes -- Piz, Piz-t, Pit, Pik, Pik-m, Pik-p, Pita, Pita-2, and Pib -- which are commonly used in Japanese blast resistance rice breeding programs. For each resistance gene, we used the segregation information from thousands of progeny in several crosses or published gene locations to generate a marker that cosegregated with the gene and markers that closely flanked the gene on either side. The developed cosegregating markers uniquely discriminated among each of the lines with the individual resistance genes (except for Pita and Pita-2). Therefore, these markers will likely facilitate the development of multiline cultivars carrying one or a combination of these nine blast resistance genes. In addition, the systems we developed may be valuable tools in the quality control of seed production from blast-resistant multiline cultivars.
15912317	Localization of pms3, a gene for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility, to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (PSGMS) rice, in which pollen fertility is regulated by day-length, originally arose as a natural mutant in the rice cultivar Nongken 58 (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). Previous studies identified pms3 on chromosome 12 as the locus of the original PSGMS mutation. In this study we have assigned the pms3 locus to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment by genetic and physical mapping. A cross between Nongken 58S (PSGMS line) and DH80 was used to produce an F2 population of about 7000 plants, from which 892 highly sterile individuals were obtained for recombination analysis. By analyzing recombination events in the sterile individuals using a total of 157 RFLP probes from a BAC contig covering the pms3 region, the pms3 locus was localized to a sub-region of less than 1.7 cM. Further analysis of recombination events using 49 additional probes isolated from this sub-region identified markers flanking the pms3 region on each side; these markers are only 28.4-kb apart. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted the presence of five ORFs, found high homology with two ESTs in public databases, and detected three SNPs between the mutant and the wild-type parents, which may be helpful for identifying a candidate gene for pms3.
16091467	Isolation of a rice regeneration quantitative trait loci gene and its application to transformation systems.	2005	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Regeneration of plant organs is often the essential step in genetic transformation; however, the regeneration ability of a plant varies depending on the genetic background. By conventional crosses of low-regeneration rice strain Koshihikari with high-regeneration rice strain Kasalath, we identified some quantitative trait loci, which control the regeneration ability in rice. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we isolated a main quantitative trait loci gene encoding ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR) that determines regeneration ability in rice. Molecular analyses revealed that the poor regeneration ability of Koshihikari is caused by lower expression than in Kasalath and the specific activity of NiR. Using the NiR gene as a selection marker, we succeeded in selectively transforming a foreign gene into rice without exogenous marker genes. Our results demonstrate that nitrate assimilation is an important process in rice regeneration and also provide an additional selectable marker for rice transformation.
15940510	Mapping of QTLs conferring extremely early heading in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Two genes related to extremely early heading were identified in populations derived from crosses between Hoshinoyume, a variety adapted to the northernmost limit of rice cultivation (Hokkaido), and Nipponbare, a variety adapted to the temperate region of Japan. The segregations for heading date clearly revealed that a two-gene model determined the extremely early heading in the F(2) and BC(1)F(1) populations under natural field conditions in Hokkaido. Using molecular markers corresponding to ten known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for heading date, we carried out QTL analysis in the BC(1)F(1) population and detected two QTLs, qDTH-7-1 and qDTH-7-2, both on chromosome 7, and observed epistatic interaction between them. We conclude that the recessive alleles of these two genes contribute to extremely early heading for the adaptation to Hokkaido environment and to stable rice production in Hokkaido. The relationships between the two QTLs identified in this study and known QTLs are discussed.
16791702	Quantitative trait loci for panicle size, heading date and plant height co-segregating in trait-performance derived near-isogenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Near-isogenic lines (NILs) are ideal materials for precise estimation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects and map-based gene isolation. With the completion of the rice genome sequence, QTL isolation based on NILs is becoming a routine. In this study, a trait-performance derived NIL strategy was adopted to develop NILs. Two plants were identified within one inbred line of recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F(7) generation), exhibiting a significant difference in panicle size. By marker screening of the whole genome the genetic background of the two plants was estimated to be 98.7% identical. These two plants were selected as parents to produce a near-isogenic F(2) (NIL-F(2)) population, consisting of 125 individuals, in which spikelets per panicle (SPP), grains per panicle (GPP), heading date (HD) and plant height (PH) were recorded. These four traits expressed discontinuous or bimodal distribution in the NIL-F(2) population and followed the expected segregation ratios for a single Mendelian factor by progeny tests. A partial dominant QTL for the four traits was mapped to the same interval flanked by RM310 and RM126 on chromosome 8. The QTL region explained 83.0, 80.2, 94.9 and 93.8% of trait variation of SPP, GPP, HD and PH in the progenies, respectively. Progeny tests also confirmed co-segregation of QTL for the four traits, tall plants consistently flowering late and carrying large panicles. Different NILs development strategies are discussed.
16418858	Mapping QTLs that control the performance of rice tissue culture and evaluation of derived near-isogenic lines.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control the performance of tissue culture in rice were detected by using 116 RFLP markers and 183 BC1F3 lines derived from two varieties, Koshihikari and Kasalath. With time, the seed callus of Koshihikari tends to turn brown and stop growing, while that of Kasalath remains yellowish-white and proliferates continuously. The performance of tissue culture in the induction of calli from seed, the subculture of induced calli, and shoot regeneration were evaluated by five indices: induced-callus weight, induced-callus color, subcultured-callus volume, subcultured-callus color, and regeneration rate. Through callus induction and subculture, eight putative QTLs (P < 0.001) were located on chromosomes 1, 4, and 9. Among these QTLs, five Kasalath alleles and three Koshihikari alleles improved tissue culture performance. No QTL for regeneration was found. Among all the QTLs, qSv1 explained the largest phenotypic variance, 33%, in subcultured-callus volume. In induced-callus color, two detected QTLs accounted for 36.4% of the total phenotypic variance; this was the highest score among the five indices used to evaluate the performance of tissue culture. Three near-isogenic lines for QTLs, located in two regions on chromosome 1, were developed to evaluate their tissue culture performance. The Kasalath alleles in qSv1 and qSc1-1 improved callus color through callus induction and subculture, and increased the subcultured-callus volume and the fresh weight of regenerated calli, including shoots, roots, and differentiated structures. In qSc1-2, the Kasalath allele improved callus color through induction and subculture. These results verified the presence of QTLs for the volume and color of subcultured callus on chromosome 1, qSv1, qSc1-1, and qSc1-2.
16331475	QTLs influencing panicle size detected in two reciprocal introgressive line (IL) populations in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Two sets of reciprocal introgression line (IL) populations, i.e., ILs with Lemont as recurrent parent (IL_LT) and ILs with Teqing as recurrent parent (IL_TQ), were developed and evaluated for traits representing panicle size, including primary branch number (PBN), secondary branch number (SBN), and spikelet number per panicle (SNP). Together with the regression to recurrent parent by advanced backcross, transgressive segregations were observed for all traits. Correlation and regression analysis showed that SBN had much higher contribution to SNP than PBN. It was confirmed by the QTL analysis that many common loci were detected between SBN and SNP, in comparison with single common locus between PBN and SNP. One and three main effect QTLs (M-QTLs) were detected for PBN in IL_LT and IL_TQ, respectively. Six M-QTLs per trait per populations were associated with SBN and SNP. Less number and lower contribution of epistasis were detected in IL populations in comparison with mapping result from F2 or RI population. There were only four QTLs in fourteen loci (near 30%) commonly detected in both reciprocal IL populations implying the large impact of genetic background on QTLs expression.
16845479	Identification of a drought tolerant introgression line derived from Dongxiang common wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.).	2006	Plant Mol Biol	Construction of introgression lines using cultivated rice as recipient and wild rice is a novel approach to explore primitive and broad genetic resources in rice breeding. We recently generated a set of 159 introgression lines via a backcrossing program using an elite Indica cultivar rice Guichao 2 (O. sativa L. ssp. indica) as recipient and a common wild rice Dongxiang accession (O. rufipogon Griff.) as donor. In this study, we have evaluated the previously constructed 159 introgression lines for drought-tolerance. A total of 12 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to drought tolerance were mapped. Furthermore, a drought tolerant introgression line, IL23, was identified and characterized. Genotype analysis of IL23 demonstrated that IL23 contained two QTLs associated with drought tolerance, qSDT2-1 and qSDT12-2, which were located on chromosome 2 and 12 within the two introgressed segments derived from the common wild rice, respectively. Physiological characterization, including measurement of water loss, osmotic potential, electrolytical leakage, MDA content, soluble sugars content and the leaf temperature, revealed that IL23 showed the characteristics associated with drought tolerance. Identification and characterization of IL23 would provide a useful basis for isolation of novel genes associated with drought tolerance and for molecular breeding of drought tolerant rice. Furthermore, the results in this study indicated that construction of introgression lines from common wild rice should be an appropriate approach to obtain favorable genetic materials.
16614172	An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication.	2006	Science	Loss of seed shattering was a key event in the domestication of major cereals. We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation. Haplotype analysis and association analysis in various rice collections revealed that the SNP was highly associated with shattering among japonica subspecies of rice, implying that it was a target of artificial selection during rice domestication.
10809440	The rice R gene family: two distinct subfamilies containing several miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	The R and B genes of maize regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and constitute a small gene family whose evolution has been shaped by polyploidization and transposable element activity. To compare the evolution of regulatory genes in the distinct but related genomes of rice and maize, we previously isolated two R homologues from rice (Oryza sativa). The Ra1 gene on chromosome 4 can activate the anthocyanin pathway, whereas the Rb gene, of undetermined function, maps to chromosome 1. In this study, rice R genes have been further characterized. First, we found that an Rb cDNA can induce pigmentation in maize suspension cells. Second, another rice R homologue (Ra2) was identified that is more closely related to Ra1 than to Rb. Domesticated rice and its wild relatives harbor multiple Ra-like and Rb-like genes despite the fact that rice is a true diploid with the smallest genome of all the grass species analyzed to date. Finally, several miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were found in R family members. Their possible role in hastening the divergence of R genes is discussed.
10798615	Glucose modulates the abscisic acid-inducible Rab16A gene in cereal embryos.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	Glucose effects on the expression of the abscisic acid-inducible Rab16A gene were examined in rice and barley embryos. Glucose feeding to rice embryos negatively affects the endogenous abscisic acid content and represses the promoter activity of the Rab16A gene. Glucose repression of the Rab16A gene takes place both at a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional level. Modulation of the abscisic acid content in rice embryos triggered by glucose did not directly influence the expression of the rice alpha-amylase gene RAmy3D, which is known to be under glucose control. The possible interaction between the glucose and abscisic acid signaling pathway is discussed.
9765537	Changes in growth CO2 result in rapid adjustments of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase small subunit gene expression in expanding and mature leaves of rice	1998	Plant Physiol	The accumulation of soluble carbohydrates resulting from growth under elevated CO2 may potentially signal the repression of gene activity for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcS). To test this hypothesis we grew rice (Oryza sativa L.) under ambient (350 &mgr;L L-1) and high (700 &mgr;L L-1) CO2 in outdoor, sunlit, environment-controlled chambers and performed a cross-switching of growth CO2 concentration at the late-vegetative phase. Within 24 h, plants switched to high CO2 showed a 15% and 23% decrease in rbcS mRNA, whereas plants switched to ambient CO2 increased 27% and 11% in expanding and mature leaves, respectively. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase total activity and protein content 8 d after the switch increased up to 27% and 20%, respectively, in plants switched to ambient CO2, but changed very little in plants switched to high CO2. Plants maintained at high CO2 showed greater carbohydrate pool sizes and lower rbcS transcript levels than plants kept at ambient CO2. However, after switching growth CO2 concentration, there was not a simple correlation between carbohydrate and rbcS transcript levels. We conclude that although carbohydrates may be important in the regulation of rbcS expression, changes in total pool size alone could not predict the rapid changes in expression that we observed.
11094984	The promoter of rbcS in a C3 plant (rice) directs organ-specific, light-dependent expression in a C4 plant (maize), but does not confer bundle sheath cell-specific expression.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	The small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), encoded by rbcS, is essential for photosynthesis in both C3 and C4 plants, even though the cell specificity of rbcS expression is different between C3 and C4 plants. The C3 rbcS is specifically expressed in mesophyll cells, while the C4 rbcS is expressed in bundle sheath cells, and not mesophyll cells. Two chimeric genes were constructed consisting of the structural gene encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS) controlled by the two promoters from maize (C4) and rice (C3) rbcS genes. These constructs were introduced into a C4 plant, maize. Both chimeric genes were specifically expressed in photosynthetic organs, such as leaf blade, but not in non-photosynthetic organs. The expressions of the genes were also regulated by light. However, the rice promoter drove the GUS activity mainly in mesophyll cells and relatively low in bundle sheath cells, while the maize rbcS promoter induced the activity specifically in bundle sheath cells. These results suggest that the rice promoter contains some cis-acting elements responding in an organ-specific and light-inducible regulation manner in maize but does not contain element(s) for bundle sheath cell-specific expression, while the maize promoter does contain such element(s). Based on this result, we discuss the similarities and differences between the rice (C3) and maize (C4) rbcS promoter in terms of the evolution of the C4 photosynthetic gene.
15057557	Inheritance and molecular mapping of two fertility-restoring loci for Honglian gametophytic cytoplasmic male sterility in rice (Oryza sativaL.).	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	The Honglian cytoplasmic male sterility ( cms-HL) system, a novel type of gametophytic CMS in indica rice, is being used for the large-scale commercial production of hybrid rice in China. However, the genetic basis of fertility restoration ( Rf) in cms-HL remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that fertility restoration is controlled by a single locus located on chromosome 10, close to the loci Rf1 and Rf4, which respond to cms-BT and cms-WA, respectively. To determine if the Rf locus for cms-HL is different from these Rf loci and to establish fine-scale genetic and physical maps for map-based cloning of the Rf gene, high-resolution mapping of the Rf gene was carried out using RAPD and microsatellite markers in three BCF(1) populations. The results of the genetic linkage analysis indicated that two Rf loci respond to cms-HL, and that these are located in different regions of chromosome 10. One of these loci, Rf5, co-segregates with the SSR marker RM3150, and is flanked by RM1108 and RM5373, which are 0.9 cM and 1.3 cM away, respectively. Another Rf locus, designated as Rf6(t), co-segregates with RM5373, and is flanked by RM6737 and SBD07 at genetic distances of 0.4 cM. The results also demonstrated these loci are distinct from Rf1 and Rf4. A 105-kb BAC clone covering the Rf6(t) locus was obtained from a rice BAC library. The sequence of a 66-kb segment spanning the Rf6(t) locus was determined by a BLASTX search in the genomic sequence database established for the cultivar 93-11.
16798940	Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes.	2006	Plant Physiol	The Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcriptional activator rice (Oryza sativa) prolamin box binding factor (RPBF), which is involved in gene regulation of rice seed storage proteins, has been isolated from rice cDNA expressed sequence tag clones containing the conserved Dof. RPBF is found as a single gene per haploid genome. Comparison of RPBF genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the genomic copy is interrupted by one long intron of 1,892 bp in the 5' noncoding region. We demonstrated by transient expression in rice callus protoplasts that the isolated RPBF trans-activated several storage protein genes via an AAAG target sequence located within their promoters, and with methylation interference experiments the additional AAAG-like sequences in promoters of genes expressed in maturing seeds were recognized by the RPBF protein. Binding was sequence specific, since mutation of the AAAG motif or its derivatives decreased both binding and trans-activation by RPBF. Synergism between RPBF and RISBZ1 recognizing the GCN4 motif [TGA(G/C)TCA] was observed in the expression of many storage protein genes. Overexpression of both transcription factors gave rise to much higher levels of expression than the sum of individual activities elicited by either RPBF or RISBZ1 alone. Furthermore, mutation of recognition sites suppressed reciprocal trans-activation ability, indicating that there are mutual interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF. The RPBF gene is predominantly expressed in maturing endosperm and coordinately expressed with seed storage protein genes, and is involved in the quantitative regulation of genes expressed in the endosperm in cooperation with RISBZ1.
15947907	Molecular mapping of the fertility restorer gene for ms-CW-type cytoplasmic male sterility of rice.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was first reported using the cytoplasm of a Chinese wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff. strain W1. However, it was not possible to characterize this ms-CW-type CMS in more detail until a restorer line had been developed due to the lack of restorer genes among cultivars thus far tested. The breeding of a restorer line (W1-R) was eventually achieved by transferring the restorer gene(s) of W1 to a cultivar. We report here the characterization of the ms-CW pollen grains and mapping of the restorer gene for ms-CW-type CMS. Pollen grains of the male-sterile plants appeared to be normal and viable based on the fluorochromatic reaction test, but they did not germinate on normal stigmas. The 1:1 segregation of fertile and sterile plants in a BC(1)F(1) population from a cross between W1-R and a maintainer line demonstrated that fertility restoration is controlled by a single gene. The fertile seed set of all the F(2) plants examined indicated that the fertility restoration functions gametophytically. We designated the fertility restorer gene Rfcw. Using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, we localized Rfcw to chromosome 4 with a genetic distance of 0.6 cM from the nearest SSR marker.
16889974	rHsp90 gene expression in response to several environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	None	Plant Physiol Biochem	In this study, the gene for a rice (Oryza sativa L.) 90 kDa heat shock protein (rHsp90, GenBank accession no. AB037681) was identified by screening rice root cDNAs that were up-regulated under carbonate (NaHCO(3)) stress using the method of differential display, and cloned. The open-reading-frame of rHsp90-cDNA was predicted to encode a protein containing 810 amino acids, which showed high similarity to proteins in Hordeum vulgare (accession no. X67960) and Catharathus roseus (accession no. L14594). Further studies showed that rHsp90 mRNA accumulated following exposure to several abiotic stresses, including salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), desiccation (using polyethylene glycol), high pH (8.0 and 11.0) and high temperature (42 and 50 degrees C). Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) over-expressing rHsp90 exhibited greater tolerance to NaCl, Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) and tobacco seedlings over-expressing rHsp90 could tolerate salt concentrations as high as 200 mM NaCl, whereas untransformed control seedlings couldn't. These results suggest that rHsp90 plays an important role in multiple environmental stresses.
10949374	Constitutive expression of the defense-related Rir1b gene in transgenic rice plants confers enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	The Rirlb gene of rice (Oryza sativa) is one of a set of putative defense genes whose transcripts accumulate upon inoculation of rice with the non-host pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. It belongs to a family of genes encoding small extracellular proteins so far only identified in cereals. To assess the function of the Rirlb gene in rice blast resistance, it was placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and transferred into rice plants of the japonica variety Taipei 309 by biolistic transformation of immature embryos. Two out of 12 hygromycin-resistant regenerated plants (OE1 and OE3) were fertile. DNA gel blot analysis suggested that these two T0 plants were independent transformants, each of which had stably incorporated one complete copy of the transgene into the genome. In addition, the OE1 plant appeared also a contain a rearranged copy or incomplete copy. T1 plants homozygous for the transgene were identified by DNA gel blot analysis of individual T2 progeny and further propagated. Expression analysis of the transgene showed that the transgene was active both in T1 plants and homozygous decendants. Challenge inoculation of homozygous transgenic plants with Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, revealed that both independent transgenic lines were more resistant than the untransformed wild type, suggesting that over-expression of the Rirlb gene confers partial resistance against this important pathogen.
16603668	Promoter shuffling at a nuclear gene for mitochondrial RPL27. Involvement of interchromosome and subsequent intrachromosome recombinations.	2006	Plant Physiol	The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrial genome contains a mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 (rpl27) gene, whereas the rpl27 gene is absent from all plant mitochondrial genomes examined to date. This suggests that plant mitochondrial rpl27 genes have been transferred previously from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome. A nuclear cDNA encoding mitochondrial RPL27 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa). Three similar sequences were identified: rpl27-1 and rpl27-2 on chromosome 8 and rpl27-3 on chromosome 4. Harr plot analysis suggests that they were generated by inter- and intrachromosomal duplications. Interestingly, the transcribed rpl27 gene (rpl27-1) acquired a promoter sequence that was derived from the rice spt16 (Osspt16) gene, the homolog of a global transcription factor in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) located downstream from the rpl27-3 sequence on chromosome 4, after inter- and intrachromosomal recombination. Reverse transcription-PCR and promoter assay revealed that the rpl27 mRNAs were mainly transcribed from rpl27-1. A repeat of seven nucleotides (AATAGTT) was identified at the junction of rpl27-1 and rpl27-2 on chromosome 8, and the same repeat was also identified at the 5' end of rpl27-2 and the 3' end of rpl27-1. This repeat (AATAGTT) contains the hot-spot sequence AGTT, which is preferentially recognized by topoisomerase I in wheat (Triticum aestivum) germ, suggesting the involvement of topoisomerase I in this recombination. We here report the example of promoter shuffling and show that this promoter shuffling resulted from a recent segmental duplication through inter- and intrachromosomal recombination events.
2381420	Rice chloroplast RNA polymerase genes: the absence of an intron in rpoC1 and the presence of an extra sequence in rpoC2.	1990	Mol Gen Genet	The chloroplast genome contains sequences homologous to the Escherichia coli rpoA, rpoB and rpoC genes. The chloroplast rpoC gene is divided into rpoC1 and rpoC2, of which rpoC1 contains an intron. Comparison of the rice rpo genes with those from tobacco, spinach and liverwort revealed unique features of the rice genes; the lack of an intron in rpoC1 and the presence of an extra sequence of 381 bp in rpoC2. The intron in rpoC1 is thus optional, and possible intron boundary sites in split rpoC1 genes can be estimated by comparison with rice rpoC1. The extra sequence is located in the middle of rpoC2 and has repeated structures. The amino acid sequence deduced from this sequence is extremely hydrophilic and anionic. The origin and function of this sequence are discussed.
9645425	Genes for the ribosomal S4 protein encoded in higher plant mitochondria are transcribed, edited, and translated.	1998	Mol Gen Genet	Here we describe the structure and expression of the mitochondrial gene that encodes the S4 subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (rps4) in two higher plants, rapeseed and rice. The ORFs of rapeseed and rice rps4 genes are 362 and 352 codons long, respectively, and their corresponding transcripts are edited (C-to-U conversions) in 19 and 15 positions, respectively. The amino acid sequences deduced from the sequences of the two rps4 genes are 78.1% identical to each other and show about 50% identity to the liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) mitochondrial RPS4 polypeptide. Both higher plant mitochondrial genes have an inserted sequence (of 137 and 141 codons for rapeseed and rice, respectively) relative to the liverwort rps4 gene. In rice rps4, the 3' portion of the inserted sequence can potentially form two stem-loop structures that resemble two domains characteristic of group II introns, i.e., domains V and VI. However, RT-PCR analysis showed that these sequences were not spliced out during maturation of the rps4 transcripts. Antibodies specific for the plant RPS4 proteins were prepared. Protein blot analysis revealed that RPS4 polypeptides are present in both rapeseed and rice mitochondria, whose sizes are in agreement with the molecular weights calculated from the non-spliced sequences. The rps4 genes and RPS4 polypeptides have been also identified in the mitochondria of wheat, maize, soybean, and turnip by Southern and Western analyses, respectively.
16897470	RTS, a rice anther-specific gene is required for male fertility and its promoter sequence directs tissue-specific gene expression in different plant species.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	A tapetum-specific gene, RTS, has been isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library from rice panicles. RTS is a unique gene in the rice genome. RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicates that this gene is predominantly expressed in the anther's tapetum during meiosis and disappears before anthesis. RTS has no introns and encodes a putative polypeptide of 94 amino acids with a hydrophobic N-terminal region. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the gene do not show significant homology to any known sequences. However, a sequence in the promoter region, GAATTTGTTA, differs only by one or two nucleotides from one of the conserved motifs in the promoter region of two pollen-specific genes of tomato. Several other sequence motifs found in other anther-specific promoters were also identified in the promoter of the RTS gene. Transgenic and antisense RNA approaches revealed that RTS gene is required for male fertility in rice. The promoter region of RTS, when fused to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease gene, barnase, or the antisense of the RTS gene, is able to drive tissue-specific expression of both genes in rice, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and Arabidopsis, conferring male sterility to the transgenic plants. Light and near-infrared confocal microscopy of cross-sections through developing flowers of male-sterile transgenics shows that tissue-specific expression of barnase or the antisense RTS genes interrupts tapetal development, resulting in deformed non-viable pollen. These results demonstrate a critical role of the RTS gene in pollen development in rice and the versatile application of the RTS gene promoter in directing anther-specific gene expression in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, pointing to a potential for exploiting this gene and its promoter for engineering male sterility for hybrid production of various plant species.
11999843	Mapping QTLs associated with drought avoidance in upland rice grown in the Philippines and West Africa.	None	Plant Mol Biol	Localizing genes that contribute to drought avoidance in a quantitative way should enable the exploitation of these genes in breeding through marker-assisted selection, and may lead to the discovery of gene identity and function. Between 110 and 176 F6 recombinant inbred lines from a mapping population derived from a cross of upland rice varieties Bala and Azucena have been evaluated for indicators of drought avoidance in sites in the Philippines and West Africa over two dry seasons. A molecular map with 102 RFLP, 34 AFLP and six microsatellite markers has been used to map (by composite interval mapping) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the visual scores of leaf rolling and leaf drying and leaf relative water content. QTLs were mapped for each site and across sites. A total of 17 regions were identified which contained QTLs with a LOD score greater than 3.2. For leaf rolling, Bala was the parent contributing the majority of positive alleles whilst for the other traits, Bala and Azucena contributed more evenly. Six of the 17 regions influenced more than one trait, explaining the phenotypic correlations between traits that were observed. Three QTLs appeared to be specific to the Philippines experiments. One QTL had opposing effects in the Philippines and West Africa. QTLs for relative water content were detected on chromosome 8, congruent with an osmotic adjustment QTL identified in another population. Only three of the QTLs identified here have not been reliably identified in the two other populations that have been screened for drought avoidance. By using several populations assessed for drought avoidance in different sites, the distribution and utility of QTLs for drought avoidance in rice is being elucidated.
16788798	Identification of simple sequence repeat markers for utilizing wide-compatibility genes in inter-subspecific hybrids in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Although pronounced heterosis in inter-subspecific hybrids was known in rice for a long time, its utilization for hybrid rice breeding has been limited due to their hybrid sterility (HS). For the last two decades, however, a few inter-subspecific hybrids have been developed by incorporating wide-compatibility genes (WCG) that resolve HS, into parental lines of these inter-subspecific hybrids. For effective use of WCG, it is necessary to find convenient markers linked to WCG of practical importance. In this paper, initially a set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in the vicinity of known WCG loci identified based on comparative linkage maps have been surveyed in a population derived from the three-way cross- IR36/Dular//Akihikari, where a known donor of WCG Dular was crossed to a representative indica and japonica cultivar. Of the five parental polymorphic markers, RM253 and RM276 were found to be closely linked to the WCG locus S5 at a distance of 3.0 and 2.8 cM, respectively. Later, loci for HS were examined in three F(2) populations derived from inter-subspecific crosses, with same set of SSR markers. The locus S8 was confirmed to have major influence on HS in the F(2 )population derived from CHMRF-1/Taichung65 since two SSR markers in its vicinity, RM412 and RM141, co-segregated with HS at a map distance of 7.6 and 4.8 cM, respectively. In the F(2) population derived from the cross BPT5204/Taipei309, three SSR markers in the vicinity of S5, RM50, RM276 and RM136 co-segregated with HS at a map distance of 4.2, 3.2 and 7.8 cM, respectively. In the third F(2 )population derived from Swarna/Taipei309, the SSR markers in the vicinity of S5, RM225, RM253, RM50, RM276 and RM136 were identified to co-segregate with HS at a map distance of 3.2, 2.6, 3.4, 2.6 and 6.6 cM, respectively. These results indicated a clear picture of WCG in Dular as well as the predominant role of HS alleles at S5 locus. The identified SSR markers are expected to be used for incorporation of WCG into parental lines in hybrid rice breeding to solve HS in inter-subspecific hybrids.
16177904	Delimitation of the rice wide compatibility gene S5 ( n ) to a 40-kb DNA fragment.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Wide compatibility varieties (WCVs) are a special class of rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm that produces hybrids with normal pollen and spikelet fertility when crossed with both indica and japonica subspecies. The wide compatibility gene S5 ( n ) has been used extensively in inter-subspecific hybrid breeding programs. We previously mapped the S5 locus to a 2.2-cM genomic region between RM253 and R2349 on chromosome 6, using a population of 356 F(1) plants derived from the three-way cross 02428/Nanjing11//Balilla. In this study, a chromosome walking strategy was employed to construct a physical map covering this genomic region using these two closest markers as the starting points. A physical map consisting of six overlapping BAC clones was formed, spanning a genomic region of 540-kb in length. By analyzing recombination events from a population of 8,000 F(1) plants derived from a three-way cross based on near isogenic lines of the S5 locus, the S5 locus was localized to a DNA fragment of 40-kb in length, flanked by two shotgun subclones, 7B1 and 15D2. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted five open reading frames, encoding xyloglucan fucosyltransferases, dnak-type molecular chaperone BiP, a putative eukaryotic aspartyl protease, and a hypothetical protein. This result will be very useful in molecular cloning of the S5 ( n ) allele and marker-assisted transferring of the wide compatibility gene in rice breeding programs.
16133303	Delimiting a rice wide-compatibility gene S5n to a 50 kb region.	2005	Theor Appl Genet	Wide-compatibility (WC) is one of the most important traits in rice, which can overcome the fertility barrier in the indica/japonica hybrids, and hence to make it possible to utilize the higher yield potential of inter-subspecific hybrids. The S5n gene located on chromosome 6 has been previously reported to be responsible for the wide-compatibility in rice. Here we report the precise location of the S5n gene. In the first-pass mapping, the S5n gene was restricted within a 200 kb region by using a population of 242 isogenic lines in combination with high-density markers developed in the S5 region. In the fine mapping, the S5 region was further saturated with newly developed markers and more isogenic lines (549 in total) were investigated. Eventually, the S5n gene was mapped within a 50 kb region delimited by the left marker J13 and the right marker J17. One BAC clone screened from the BAC library of the WC rice variety 02428 covered the whole S5 region. Sequence analysis of the 50 kb region revealed two candidate genes, coding an aspartyl protease and a hypothetical protein. This result would greatly accelerate both cloning and marker-assisted selection of this important S5n gene.
14526120	Starch-branching enzyme I-deficient mutation specifically affects the structure and properties of starch in rice endosperm.	2003	Plant Physiol	We have isolated a starch mutant that was deficient in starch-branching enzyme I (BEI) from the endosperm mutant stocks of rice (Oryza sativa) induced by the treatment of fertilized egg cells with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. The deficiency of BEI in this mutant was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively designated as starch-branching enzyme mutant 1 (sbe1). The mutant endosperm exhibited the normal phenotype and contained the same amount of starch as the wild type. However, the mutation apparently altered the fine structure of amylopectin. The mutant amylopectin was characterized by significant decrease in both long chains with degree of polymerization (DP) > or = 37 and short chains with DP 12 to 21, marked increase in short chains with DP < or = 10 (A chains), and slight increase in intermediate chains with DP 24 to 34, suggesting that BEI specifically synthesizes B1 and B2-3 chains. The endosperm starch from the sbe1 mutant had a lower onset concentration for urea gelatinization and a lower onset temperature for thermo-gelatinization compared with the wild type, indicating that the genetic modification of amylopectin fine structure is responsible for changes in physicochemical properties of sbe1 starch.
10323229	Identification of mutable slender glume gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1999	Mol Gen Genet	The segregation pattern and chromosomal location of a slender glume mutation, induced by gamma-ray irradiation, was investigated. The mutation is genetically unstable: in the selfed progenies of slender glumed plants, not only plants with normal glumes but also plants that are chimeric for glume shape almost always appear at low frequency. The results showed that the mutation is controlled by a single recessive, mutable mutant gene slg. The frequency of reversion of slg to its wild-type state was little affected by crossing, back-crossing, genetic background or cytoplasmic factors. Conventional trisomic and linkage analyses revealed that the slg locus was located close to the rfs (rolled fine stripe leaf) locus on chromosome 7. In a subsequent RFLP analysis, slg was found to be located between the two RFLP loci XNpb20 and XNpb33, with recombination values of 3.0 and 3.2%, respectively. Southern analysis indicated that the mutability of slg is caused by none of the known transposable elements in rice. From these results, we infer that slg has a novel transposable DNA insert in its vicinity, which was possibly activated by gamma-ray irradiation.
12650614	Molecular characterization of a novel senescence-associated gene SPA15 induced during leaf senescence in sweet potato.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	The structure and expression of a novel senescence-associated gene (SPA15) of sweet potato were characterized. The protein coding region of the gene consists of 13 exons encoding 420 amino acids. Apparent homologues of this sweet potato gene are found in a variety of dicot and monocot plants, but not in animals or microorganisms. Examination of the expression patterns of the SPA15 gene in sweet potato reveals that the transcripts of SPA15 are specifically induced in the senescing leaves, and the temporal profile of SPA15 protein accumulation is correlated with that of SPA15 transcripts. Studies on the distribution of SPA15 homologue in rice plants also indicate that SPA15 homologue is up-regulated specifically in senescing rice leaves. Treatment of detached sweet potato leaves with phytohormones including ethylene, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid and abscisic acid resulted in a high-level induction of SPA15. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis demonstrates that SPA15 is specifically associated with the cell wall. The potential role for SPA15 during leaf senescence is discussed.
15258851	Physical mapping of a rice lesion mimic gene, Spl1 , to a 70-kb segment of rice chromosome 12.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	The rice lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf 1 ( spl1) was first identified in the rice ( Oryza sativa) cultivar Asahi in 1965. This mutant displayed spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of any pathogen, and was found to confer resistance to multiple isolates of rice blast. We employed a map-based cloning strategy to localize the Spl1 gene. A total of ten cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers linked to the Spl1 gene were identified and mapped to an 8.5-cM region on chromosome 12. A high-resolution genetic map was developed using these ten CAPS markers and a segregating population consisting of 3202 individuals. A BAC contig containing four BAC clones was constructed, and Spl1 was localized to a 423-kb region. Seven spl1 mutants were obtained from the IR64 deletion mutant collection, and molecular analysis using these mutants delimited the Spl1 gene to a 70-kb interval, covered by two BAC clones. These results provide the basis for cloning this gene, which is involved in cell death and disease resistance in rice.
12395200	Fine genetic mapping and physical delimitation of the lesion mimic gene Spl11 to a 160-kb DNA segment of the rice genome.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	The rice lesion mimic mutant spl11 was previously found to confer broad-spectrum disease resistance to both Magnaporthe grisea and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. To better understand the molecular basis underlying cell death and disease resistance in rice, a map-based cloning strategy has been employed to isolate Spl11. Five Spl11-linked RAPD markers were developed and four of them were mapped to rice chromosome 12. A high-resolution genetic map was developed using a segregating population consisting of 1138 lesion mimic individuals. Recombination suppression was observed in the vicinity of Spl11. Three molecular markers tightly linked to Spl11 were identified and used to screen a BAC library. A contig spanning the Spl11 locus was constructed and physical mapping delimited Spl11 to a 160-kb DNA segment within a single BAC clone. These results provide the essential information for the final isolation of this important gene in the rice defense pathway.
15888683	Large-scale identification of expressed sequence tags involved in rice and rice blast fungus interaction.	2005	Plant Physiol	To better understand the molecular basis of the defense response against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), a large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing approach was used to identify genes involved in the early infection stages in rice (Oryza sativa). Six cDNA libraries were constructed using infected leaf tissues harvested from 6 conditions: resistant, partially resistant, and susceptible reactions at both 6 and 24 h after inoculation. Two additional libraries were constructed using uninoculated leaves and leaves from the lesion mimic mutant spl11. A total of 68,920 ESTs were generated from 8 libraries. Clustering and assembly analyses resulted in 13,570 unique sequences from 10,934 contigs and 2,636 singletons. Gene function classification showed that 42% of the ESTs were predicted to have putative gene function. Comparison of the pathogen-challenged libraries with the uninoculated control library revealed an increase in the percentage of genes in the functional categories of defense and signal transduction mechanisms and cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis grouped the eight libraries based on their disease reactions. A total of 7,748 new and unique ESTs were identified from our collection compared with the KOME full-length cDNA collection. Interestingly, we found that rice ESTs are more closely related to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) ESTs than to barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) ESTs. The large cataloged collection of rice ESTs in this study provides a solid foundation for further characterization of the rice defense response and is a useful public genomic resource for rice functional genomics studies.
11027714	Tissue-specific and developmental pattern of expression of the rice sps1 gene.	2000	Plant Physiol	Sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) is one of the key regulatory enzymes in carbon assimilation and partitioning in plants. SPS plays a central role in the production of sucrose in photosynthetic cells and in the conversion of starch or fatty acids into sucrose in germinating seeds. To explore the mechanisms that regulate the tissue-specific and developmental distribution of SPS, the expression pattern of rice (Oryza sativa) sps1 (GenBank accession no. U33175) was examined by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and the expression directed by the sps1 promoter using the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. It was found that the expression of the rice sps1 gene is limited to mesophyll cells in leaves, the scutellum of germinating seedlings, and pollen of immature inflorescences. During leaf development, the sps1 promoter directs a basipetal pattern of expression that coincides with the distribution of SPS activity during the leaf sink-to-source transition. It was also found that during the vegetative part of the growth cycle, SPS expression and enzymatic activity are highest in the youngest fully expanded leaf. Additionally, it was observed that the expression of the sps1 promoter is regulated by light and dependent on plastid development in photosynthetic tissues, whereas expression in scutellum is independent of both light and plastid development.
10852491	A high-resolution linkage map of the vicinity of the rice submergence tolerance locus Sub1.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	Resistance to submergence stress is an important breeding objective in areas where rice cultivars are subjected to complete inundation for a week or more. The present study was conducted to develop a high-resolution map of the region surrounding the submergence tolerance gene Sub1 in rice, which derives from the Indian cultivar FR13A. Submergence screening of 8-day-old plants of F3 families kept for 14 days submerged in 60 cm of water allowed an accurate classification of Sub1 phenotypes. Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify AFLP markers linked to Sub1. A population of 2950 F2 plants segregating for Sub1 was screened with two RFLP markers flanking the Sub1 locus, 2.4 and 4.9 cM away. Submergence tolerance was measured in the recombinant plants, and AFLP markers closely linked to Sub1 were mapped. Two AFLP markers cosegregated with Sub1 in this large population, and other markers were localized within 0.2 cM of Sub1. The high-resolution map should serve as the basis for map-based cloning of this important locus, as it will permit the identification of BAC clones spanning the region.
16816135	A variable cluster of ethylene response factor-like genes regulates metabolic and developmental acclimation responses to submergence in rice.	2006	Plant Cell	Submergence-1 (Sub1), a major quantitative trait locus affecting tolerance to complete submergence in lowland rice (Oryza sativa), contains two or three ethylene response factor (ERF)-like genes whose transcripts are regulated by submergence. In the submergence-intolerant japonica cultivar M202, this locus encodes two ERF genes, Sub1B and Sub1C. In the tolerant near-isogenic line containing the Sub1 locus from the indica FR13A, M202(Sub1), the locus additionally encodes the ERF gene Sub1A. During submergence, the tolerant M202(Sub1) displayed restrained leaf and internode elongation, chlorophyll degradation, and carbohydrate consumption, whereas the enzymatic activities of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase were increased significantly compared with the intolerant M202. Transcript levels of genes associated with carbohydrate consumption, ethanolic fermentation, and cell expansion were distinctly regulated in the two lines. Sub1A and Sub1C transcript levels were shown to be upregulated by submergence and ethylene, with the Sub1C allele in M202 also upregulated by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA). These findings demonstrate that the Sub1 region haplotype determines ethylene- and GA-mediated metabolic and developmental responses to submergence through differential expression of Sub1A and Sub1C. Submergence tolerance in lowland rice is conferred by a specific allele variant of Sub1A that dampens ethylene production and GA responsiveness, causing quiescence in growth that correlates with the capacity for regrowth upon desubmergence.
14576284	Identification of a locus increasing rice yield and physiological analysis of its function.	2003	Plant Physiol	I identified a new locus responsible for increased yield potential and evaluated its physiological function to understand how to improve potential yield in rice (Oryza sativa) plants. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 1,000-grain weight (TGW) were analyzed under different environments over 3 years in backcross inbred lines of rice japonica cv Nipponbare x indica cv Kasalath. Four QTLs for this trait were detected across environments; rice cv Kasalath had a positive allele only at one QTL on chromosome 6 (tgw6). A near-isogenic line (NILtgw6) that carried a rice cv Kasalath chromosomal segment corresponding to tgw6 in the rice cv Nipponbare genetic background was selected and analyzed to clarify the physiological function of this locus. The carbohydrate storage capacity before heading in NILtgw6 was superior to that in rice cv Nipponbare (control), but other characters (e.g. photosynthetic ability in flag leaf and traits related to plant type) were the same in both plants. In the leaf sheath, the main organ that accumulates carbohydrate before heading in rice, higher contents of carbohydrate and transcripts of genes related to starch synthesis were found in NILtgw6 than in rice cv Nipponbare. Compared with those in rice cv Nipponbare, a high-yield modern cultivar, TGW and yield per plant were significantly higher in NILtgw6, by 10% and 15%, respectively (P[f] < 0.01). These results suggest that tgw6 improves the carbohydrate storage capacity and consequently increases the yield potential in NILtgw6.
16133314	Genetic characterization and fine mapping of a novel thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile gene tms6 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	Theor Appl Genet	The application of genetic male sterility in hybrid rice production has great potential to revolutionize hybrid seed production methodology. The two-line breeding system by using thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) has been discovered and successfully developed as a breeding strategy in rice. One TGMS gene was investigated by a spontaneous rice mutant line, Sokcho-MS, originated from a Korean japonica variety. It was shown that Sokcho-MS is completely sterile at a temperature higher than 27 degrees C and/or lower than 25 degrees C during the development of spikelets, but fertile at the temperature ranging from 25 to 27 degrees C regardless of the levels of day-length. Genetic analysis and molecular mapping based on SSR, STS and EST markers revealed that a single recessive gene locus involved the control of genic male sterility in Sokcho-MS. By using an F2 mapping population derived from a cross between Sokcho-MS and a fertile indica variety Neda, the new TGMS gene, designated as tms6, was mapped primarily to the long arm of chromosome 5 of Oryza sativa at the interval between markers E60663 (2.0 cM) and RM440 (5.8 cM). Subsequently, tms6 was fine mapped to the interval between markers RM3351 (0.1 cM) and E60663 (1.9 cM). As tms6 appeared to be independent of other mapped TGMS genes in rice, the genetic basis of Sokcho-MS was further discussed.
1685658	Diversification of the rice Waxy gene by insertion of mobile DNA elements into introns.	1991	Jpn J Genet	The waxy (wx) gene of Oryza glaberrima was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. A waxy mutant of O. glaberrima showing a glutinous phenotype was found to contain a substitution mutation generating a termination codon in the coding region of the wx gene. The Wx sequence of O. glaberrima was different from that of Oryza sativa by substitutions and insertions/deletions, among which only a few substitutions occurred in several exons not to severely alter the amino acid sequence of the Wx protein. The most striking difference observed in introns was a 139-bp deletion (or insertion) in intron 10 of O. glaberrima (or O. sativa). In O. sativa, 125 bp of the 139-bp sequence was flanked by direct repeats of a 14-bp sequence. A sequence homologous to the 125-bp sequence was found in the region preceding exon 2; this sequence was also flanked by direct repeats of another 14-bp sequence. This result and the observation that the 125-bp sequence was interspersed in rice genomes indicate that they are SINEs (short interspersed elements) in the plant system. We also identified a DNA sequence with long terminal inverted repeats in intron 13 of both O. glaberrima and O. sativa. This sequence was present in multiple copies in rice genomes, suggesting that it is a transposable element. These results obtained suggest that mobile DNA elements have diversified the rice Waxy gene by inserting into introns, each of which may originally have a length of about 100 bp.
11361345	The rice retrotransposon Tos17 prefers low-copy-number sequences as integration targets.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	The rice retrotransposon Tos17 is highly activated by tissue culture. To evaluate the impact of transposition of Tos17 on the rice genome and examine its utility for insertional mutagenesis, more than 100 sequences flanking newly transposed Tos17 copies were characterised. The 5-bp target-site duplications flanking Tos17 did not show any consensus sequence, and preferred nucleotides, A/T and G/C, were only found at the second and third nucleotides from both ends of the target site duplications, respectively, indicating that Tos17 has relatively low target-site specificity at the nucleotide sequence level. Integration targets were widely distributed over the chromosomes; however, preferential integration into the sucrose synthase 2 gene and into Tos17 itself was demonstrated by PCR screening using pooled DNA prepared from the mutant population. Hybridisation studies indicated that Tos17 preferentially integrates into low-copy-number regions of the genome. In agreement with this result, about 30% of flanking sequences examined showed significant homology to known genes. Taken together, these results show that Tos17 can have a significant impact on the rice genome and can be used as a tool for efficient insertional mutagenesis.
16821043	Epigenetic regulation of the rice retrotransposon Tos17.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	Transposable elements are major components of plant genomes. Their activity seems to be epigenetically regulated by gene silencing systems. Here we report epigenetic variation in the retrotransposon Tos17 activity in rice varieties. Of the two copies of Tos17 present in chromosome 7 (Tos17 (chr.7)) and chromosome 10 (Tos17 (chr.10)), Tos17 (chr.7) is strongly activated by tissue culture in most varieties including Nipponbare except for Moritawase, despite the identity of the DNA sequences in Moritawase and Nipponbare. Tos17 (chr.7) activity correlated with its methylation status, and Tos17 (chr.7 )in Moritawase was heavily methylated and activated by treatment of 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), a DNA methylation inhibitor. Although the original copies of Tos17 are methylated to some extent in all varieties examined, the transposed copies in calli mostly are not methylated. When plants were regenerated from calli, the degree of methylation of the Tos17 DNA increased gradually with the growth of plants, and a significant progress of DNA methylation occurred in the next generation after a completed reproductive cycle. With increasing DNA methylation, the transcription of transposed and original Tos17 copies driven by its own as well as by a flanking gene promoter were suppressed. We conclude that Tos17 DNA methylation controls the transpositional activity of Tos17, and modulates the activity of neighboring genes. Based on the analysis of the inactive Tos17 (chr.10), we propose that another mechanism, called transcriptional interference, is involved in the control of Tos17 activity.
11244118	Nonsense-mediated decay of mutant waxy mRNA in rice.	2001	Plant Physiol	Two rice (Oryza sativa) waxy mutations of the Japonica background were shown to contain approximately 20% of the fully spliced mRNA relative to the wild type. Sequencing analysis of the entire waxy genes of the two mutants revealed the presence of premature translation termination codons in exon 2 and exon 7. These results indicated that the lower accumulation of fully spliced RNA in the mutants was caused by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which is an RNA surveillance system universally found in eukaryotes. It is interesting that levels of RNA retaining intron 1 were not changed by premature nonsense codons, suggesting that splicing may be linked with NMD in plants, as previously found in mammalian cells. Measurements of the half-lives of waxy RNAs in transfected rice protoplasts indicated that the half-life of waxy RNA with a premature nonsense codon was 3.3 times shorter than that without a premature nonsense codon. Because the wild-type waxy transcripts, which are derived from the Wx(b) gene predominantly distributed among Japonica rice, have been shown to be less efficiently spliced and their alternative splicing has been documented, we examined whether these splicing properties influenced the efficiency of NMD. However, no effects were observed. These results established that NMD occurs in rice waxy RNA containing a premature nonsense codon.
14730444	Genome-wide analysis of defense-responsive genes in bacterial blight resistance of rice mediated by the recessive R gene xa13.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	Defense responses triggered by dominant and recessive disease resistance (R) genes are presumed to be regulated by different molecular mechanisms. In order to characterize the genes activated in defense responses against bacterial blight mediated by the recessive R gene xa13, two pathogen-induced subtraction cDNA libraries were constructed using the resistant rice line IRBB13--which carries xa13--and its susceptible, near-isogenic, parental line IR24. Clustering analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified 702 unique expressed sequences as being involved in the defense responses triggered by xa13; 16% of these are new rice ESTs. These sequences define 702 genes, putatively encoding a wide range of products, including defense-responsive genes commonly involved in different host-pathogen interactions, genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with pathogen-induced defense responses, and genes (38%) with no homology to previously described functional genes. In addition, R-like genes putatively encoding nucleotide-binding site/leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) and LRR receptor kinase proteins were observed to be induced in the disease resistance activated by xa13. A total of 568 defense-responsive ESTs were mapped to 588 loci on the rice molecular linkage map through bioinformatic analysis. About 48% of the mapped ESTs co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to various rice diseases, including bacterial blight, rice blast, sheath blight and yellow mottle virus. Furthermore, some defense-responsive sequences were conserved at similar locations on different chromosomes. These results reveal the complexity of xa13-mediated resistance. The information obtained in this study provides a large source of candidate genes for understanding the molecular bases of defense responses activated by recessive R genes and of quantitative disease resistance.
16328230	Targeting xa13, a recessive gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice.	2006	Theor Appl Genet	Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious diseases of rice worldwide. Thirty bacterial blight resistance (R) genes (21 dominant genes and 9 recessive genes) in rice have been identified. They are the main sources for the genetic improvement of rice for resistance to Xoo. However, little is known about the recessive R genes. To clone and characterize the recessive R genes, we fine-mapped xa13, a fully recessive gene for Xoo resistance, to a DNA fragment of 14.8 kb using the map-based cloning strategy and a series of sequence-based molecular markers. Sequence analysis of this fragment indicated that this region contains only two apparently intact candidate genes (an extensin-like gene and a homologue of nodulin MtN3) and the 5' end of a predicted hypothetical gene. These results will greatly facilitate the isolation and characterization of xa13. Four PCR-based markers, E6a, SR6, ST9 and SR11 that were tightly linked to the xa13 locus, were also developed. These markers will be useful tools for the marker-assisted selection of xa13 in breeding programs.
11370857	Chromosome landing at the bacterial blight resistance gene Xa4 locus using a deep coverage rice BAC library.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	Xa4 is a dominantly inherited rice gene that confers resistance to Philippine race 1 of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice. In order to isolate the gene by positional cloning, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed from genomic DNA isolated from an Xa4-harboring accession, IRBB56. The library contains 55,296 clones with an average insert size of 132 kb, providing 14 rice genome equivalents. Three DNA markers closely linked to Xa4 were used to screen the library. The marker RS13, a resistance gene analogue that co-segregates with Xa4, identified 18 clones, of which four and six, respectively, were simultaneously detected by the other two markers, G181 and L1044. Fingerprinting and Southern analysis indicated that these clones overlapped and define an interval spanning 420 kb. In an F2 population derived from an indica variety, IR24, and its Xa4-containing near isogenic line (NIL), IRBB4, the susceptible plants were screened in order to map the Xa4 gene genetically and physically. Out of 24 insert ends isolated from the BACs in the contig, three revealed polymorphisms between IR24 and IRBB4. Two insert ends, 56M22F and 26D24R, flanked Xa4 on each side. Based on the overlap of the BACs, six overlapping clones were considered to include the Xa4 allele, one of which, 106P13, was chosen for further investigation.
16614777	Testifying the rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa5 by genetic complementation and further analyzing xa5 (Xa5) in comparison with its homolog TFIIAgamma1.	2006	Mol Genet Genomics	The recessive gene xa5 for resistance to bacterial blight resistance of rice is located on chromosome 5, and evidence based on genetic recombination has been shown to encode a small subunit of the basal transcription factor IIA (Iyer and McCouch in MPMI 17(12):1348-1354, 2004). However, xa5 has not been demonstrated by a complementation test. In this study, we introduced the dominant allele Xa5 into a homozygous xa5-line, which was developed from a cross between IRBB5 (an indica variety with xa5) and Nipponbare (a japonica variety with Xa5). Transformation of Xa5 and subsequent segregation analysis confirmed that xa5 is a V39E substitution variant of the gene for TFIIAgamma on chromosome 5 (TFIIAgamma5 or Xa5). The rice has an addition gene for TFIIAgamma exists on chromosome 1 (TFIIAgamma1). Analysis of the expression patterns of Xa5 (TFIIAgamma5)/xa5 and TFIIAgamma1 revealed that both the genes are constitutively expressed in different rice organs. However, no expression of TFIIAgamma1 could be detected in the panicle by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. To compare the structural difference between the Xa5/xa5 and TFIIAgamma1 proteins, 3-D structures were predicted using computer-aided modeling techniques. The modeled structures of Xa5 (xa5) and TFIIAgamma1 fit well with the structure of TFIIA small subunit from human, suggesting that they may all act as a small subunit of TFIIA. The E39V substitution in the xa5 protein occurs in the alpha-helix domain, a supposed conservative substitutable site, which should not affect the basal transcription function of TFIIAgamma. The structural analysis indicates that xa5 and Xa5 potentially retain their basic transcription factor function, which, in turn, may mediate the novel pathway for bacterial blight resistance and susceptibility, respectively.
14988479	A surprising diversity and abundance of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases in rice. Classification and expression analysis.	2004	Plant Physiol	A search of the recently completed genomic database of rice (Oryza sativa) identified a 29-member xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (OsXTH) gene family. This first report of a complete XTH family from a monocotyledonous species reveals that the OsXTH family is comparable in size with that of the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana, which consists of 33 AtXTH genes. This is surprising because xyloglucan, the specific substrate of XTHs, is considerably less abundant in cell walls of monocotyledons than dicotyledons and is not typically ascribed an important structural role in monocotyledons. As a first step toward determining the roles of rice XTHs, the expression patterns of all 29 OsXTH genes were examined using a quantitative DNA microarray procedure with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes. The analysis showed that most members of the rice XTH family exhibited organ- and growth stage-specific expression. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of representative OsXTH members. This revealed in more detail the temporally and spatially controlled expression profiles of individual OsXTH genes at particular sites in rice. Previous reports indicated that grasses have relatively greater xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activities, one of the two enzyme activities catalyzed by XTHs, than in equivalent tissues in dicotyledons. This observation, together with the tissue-specific and growth stage-dependent expression of a large rice XTH gene family, suggests that xyloglucan metabolism plays a more central role in monocotyledon cell wall restructuring than has been reported previously.
15863611	Enhanced dihydroflavonol-4-reductase activity and NAD homeostasis leading to cell death tolerance in transgenic rice.	2005	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The maize Hm1 gene encoding the NADPH-dependent HC-toxin reductase is capable of detoxifying HC-toxin of fungus Cochliobolus carbonum. Here, we conducted the metabolic and biochemical analysis in transgenic rice plants overexpressing an HC-toxin reductase-like gene in rice (YK1 gene). Methods employing NADPH oxidation and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that YK1 possessed dihydroflavonol-4-reductase activity in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of YK1 in both suspension-cultured cells and rice plants increased NAD(H) and NADP(H) levels by causing an increase in NAD synthetase and NAD kinase activities. Activity changes in enzymes that require NAD(P) as coenzymes were also noted in rice cells ectopically expressing YK1, where the cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide and bacterial disease was down-regulated. Thus, a strategy was proposed that the combination of dihydroflavonol-4-reductase activity and the elevated level of NAD(P)H pool may confer the prevention of induced cell death in planta.
16528562	A comprehensive expression analysis of the WRKY gene superfamily in rice plants during defense response.	2006	Plant Cell Rep	To understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of host genes during the activation of defense responses in rice, we isolated WRKY transcription factors whose expressions were altered upon attack of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. A systematic expression analysis of OsWRKYs (Oryza sativa L. WRKYs) revealed that among 45 tested genes the expression of 15 genes was increased remarkably in an incompatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Twelve of the M. grisea-inducible OsWRKY genes were also differentially regulated in rice plants infected with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In experiments with defense signaling molecules, the expression of two genes, OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY62, was increased in salicylic acid (SA)-treated leaves and the expression of three genes, OsWRKY10, OsWRKY82, and OsWRKY85 was increased by jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. OsWRKY30 and OsWRKY83 responded to both SA- and JA treatments. The expression profiles suggest that a large number of WRKY DNA-binding proteins are involved in the transcriptional activation of defense-related genes in response to rice pathogens.
12081375	Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	Using a genomic clone encoding a rice lipid transfer protein, LTP1, we analysed the activity of the 5' region of the Ltp1 gene in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) during plant development and under pathogen attack. The -1176/+13, -556/+13 and -284/+13 regions of the promoter were fused upstream from the uidA reporter gene and nos 3' polyadenylation signal, resulting in the pdelta1176Gus, pdelta556Gus and pdelta284Gus constructs which were transferred to rice by microprojectile bombardment. Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development. In leaf sheath, GUS activity which is initially strictly localized in the epidermis of growing tissue, becomes restricted to the vascular system in mature tissues. In expanded leaf blade, expression of the uidA gene was restricted to the cutting level suggesting inducibility by wounding. Strong activity was detected in lemma and palea, sterile glumes, and immature anther walls and microspores but not in female reproductive organs. No GUS activity was detected during seed embryo maturation whereas the uidA gene was strongly expressed at early stages of somatic embryogenesis in scutellum tissue. The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions. Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells. In plants harbouring the Ltp1 promoter deletion construct pdelta556Gus, activity was solely detected in the vascular system of mature leaves whereas no uidA gene expression was observed in pdelta284Gus plants. These observations are consistent with the proposed role of LTP1 in strenghtening of structural barriers and organ protection against mechanical disruption and pathogen attack.
16085936	A PIN1 family gene, OsPIN1, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Auxin transport affects a variety of important growth and developmental processes in plants, including the regulation of shoot and root branching. The asymmetrical localization of auxin influx and efflux carriers within the plasma membrane establishes the auxin gradient and facilitates its transport. REH1, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier. Phylogenetic analysis of 32 members of the PIN family, taken from across different species, showed that in terms of evolutionary relationship, OsPIN1 is closer to the PIN1 family than to the PIN2 family. It is, therefore, renamed as OsPIN1 in this study. OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1. Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants. alpha-naphthylacetic acid (alpha-NAA) treatment was able to rescue the mutated phenotypes occurring in the RNAi plants. Overexpression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio. Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering.
17446351	Hd3a protein is a mobile flowering signal in rice.	2007	Science	Florigen, the mobile signal that moves from an induced leaf to the shoot apex and causes flowering, has eluded identification since it was first proposed 70 years ago. Understanding the nature of the mobile flowering signal would provide a key insight into the molecular mechanism of floral induction. Recent studies suggest that the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a candidate for encoding florigen. We show that the protein encoded by Hd3a, a rice ortholog of FT, moves from the leaf to the shoot apical meristem and induces flowering in rice. These results suggest that the Hd3a protein may be the rice florigen.
11598221	Biochemical and genetic analysis of the effects of amylose-extender mutation in rice endosperm.	2001	Plant Physiol	Biochemical analysis of amylose-extender (ae) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) revealed that the mutation in the gene for starch-branching enzyme IIb (BEIIb) specifically altered the structure of amylopectin in the endosperm by reducing short chains with degree of polymerization of 17 or less, with the greatest decrease in chains with degree of polymerization of 8 to 12. The extent of such change was correlated with the gelatinization properties of the starch granules, as determined in terms of solubility in urea solution. The ae mutation caused a dramatic reduction in the activity of BEIIb. The activity of soluble starch synthase I (SSI) in the ae mutant was significantly lower than in the wild type, suggesting that the mutation had a pleiotropic effect on the SSI activity. In contrast, the activities of BEI, BEIIa, ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, isoamylase, isoamylase, pullulanase, and Suc synthase were not affected by the mutation. Therefore, it is stressed that the function of BEIIb cannot be complemented by BEIIa and BEI. These results strongly suggest that BEIIb plays a specific role in the transfer of short chains, which might then be extended by SS to form the A and B(1) chains of amylopectin cluster in rice endosperm.
17297616	Knockout of a starch synthase gene OsSSIIIa/Flo5 causes white-core floury endosperm in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Plant Cell Rep	To elucidate the role of SSIIIa during starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm, we characterized null mutants of this gene, generated by T-DNA insertions. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that the starch granules in these mutants are smaller and rounder compared with the wild type controls, and that the mutant endosperm is characterized by a loosely packed central portion exhibiting a floury-like phenotype. Hence, the OsSSIIIa (Oryza sativa SSIIIa) mutations are referred to as white-core floury endosperm 5-1 (flo5-1) and flo5-2. Based upon their X-ray diffraction patterns, the crystallinity of the starch in the flo5 mutant endosperm is decreased compared with wild type. Through determination of the chain-length distribution of the mutant endosperm starch, we found that flo5-1 and flo5-2 mutants have reduced the content of long chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 30 or greater compared with the controls. This suggests that OsSSIIIa/Flo5 plays an important role in generating relatively long chains in rice endosperm. In addition, DP 6 to 8 and DP 16 to 20 appeared to be reduced in endosperm starch of flo5-1 and flo5-2, whereas DP 9 to 15 and DP 22 to 29 were increased in these mutants. By the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the gelatinization temperatures of endosperm starch were found to be 1-5 degrees C lower than those of the control. We propose a distinct role for OsSSIIIa/Flo5 and the coordinated action of other SS isoforms during starch synthesis in the seed endosperm of rice.
15232694	A comprehensive expression analysis of the starch synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Planta	To elucidate the roles of the isogenes encoding starch synthase (EC 2.4.1.21) in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a comprehensive expression analysis of the gene family was conducted. Extensive searches for starch synthase genes were done in the databases of both the whole genome and full-length cDNAs of rice, and ten genes were revealed to comprise the starch synthase gene family. Multi-sequence alignment analysis of the starch synthase proteins from rice and other plant species suggested that they were grouped into five classes, soluble starch synthase I (SSI), SSII, SSIII, SSIV and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). In rice, there was one gene for SSI, three for SSII and two each for SSIII, IV and GBSS. The expression pattern of the ten genes in the developing caryopsis was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on the temporal expression patterns, the ten genes could be divided into three groups: (i) early expressers ( SSII-2, III-1, GBSSII), which are expressed in the early stage of grain filling; (ii) late expressers ( SSII-3, III-2, GBSSI), which are expressed in the mid to later stage of grain filling; and (iii) steady expressers ( SSI, II-1, IV-1, IV-2), which are expressed relatively constantly during grain filling. Within a caryopsis, the three gene groups spatially share their expression, i.e. "early expressers" in the pericarp, the "late expressers" in the endosperm" and the "steady expressers" in both tissues. In addition, this grouping was reflected in the expression pattern of various rice tissues: expression in non-endosperm, endosperm or all tissues examined. The implications in this spatio-temporal work sharing of starch synthesis isogenes are discussed.
17804793	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a group of stem cells that are responsible for plant development. Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM. In this study we showed that defects in SAM formation in shl mutants are associated with the loss of expression of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) family genes. Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway. This suggested that the ta-siRNA pathway regulates the critical step of SAM formation during rice embryogenesis. The gain-of-function experiment by the ectopic expression of SHL4 resulted in reduced accumulation of an microRNA, miR166, and partial adaxialization of leaves, supporting a role for the ta-siRNA pathway in the maintenance of leaf polarity as previously reported in maize. Analysis of the spatiotemporal expression patterns of HD-ZIPIII and miR166 in wild-type and shl mutant embryos suggested that the loss of HD-ZIPIII expression in the SAM region of the developing embryo is the result of ectopic expression of miR166. Our analysis of shl mutants demonstrated that HD-ZIPIII expression regulated by miR166 is sensitive to the ta-siRNA pathway during SAM formation in rice embryogenesis.
17204643	Cross-species identification of Mendel's I locus.	2007	Science	A key gene involved in plant senescence, mutations of which partially disable chlorophyll catabolism and confer stay-green leaf and cotyledon phenotypes, has been identified in Pisum sativum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Festuca pratensis by using classical and molecular genetics and comparative genomics. A stay-green locus in F. pratensis is syntenically equivalent to a similar stay-green locus on rice chromosome 9. Functional testing in Arabidopsis of a homolog of the rice candidate gene revealed (i) senescence-associated gene expression and (ii) a stay-green phenotype after RNA interference silencing. Genetic mapping in pea demonstrated cosegregation with the yellow/green cotyledon polymorphism (I/i) first reported by Gregor Mendel in 1866.
17513504	The senescence-induced staygreen protein regulates chlorophyll degradation.	2007	Plant Cell	Loss of green color in leaves results from chlorophyll (Chl) degradation in chloroplasts, but little is known about how Chl catabolism is regulated throughout leaf development. Using the staygreen (sgr) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which maintains greenness during leaf senescence, we identified Sgr, a senescence-associated gene encoding a novel chloroplast protein. Transgenic rice overexpressing Sgr produces yellowish-brown leaves, and Arabidopsis thaliana pheophorbide a oxygenase-impaired mutants exhibiting a stay-green phenotype during dark-induced senescence have reduced expression of Sgr homologs, indicating that Sgr regulates Chl degradation at the transcriptional level. We show that the leaf stay-greenness of the sgr mutant is associated with a failure in the destabilization of the light-harvesting chlorophyll binding protein (LHCP) complexes of the thylakoid membranes, which is a prerequisite event for the degradation of Chls and LHCPs during senescence. Transient overexpression of Sgr in Nicotiana benthamiana and an in vivo pull-down assay show that Sgr interacts with LHCPII, indicating that the Sgr-LHCPII complexes are formed in the thylakoid membranes. Thus, we propose that in senescing leaves, Sgr regulates Chl degradation by inducing LHCPII disassembly through direct interaction, leading to the degradation of Chls and Chl-free LHCPII by catabolic enzymes and proteases, respectively.
17714430	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice.	2007	Plant J	Chloroplasts undergo drastic morphological and physiological changes during senescence with a visible symptom of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation. A stay green mutant was identified and then isolated from the japonica rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Huazhiwu by gamma-ray irradiation. The stay green mutant was characterized by Chl retention, stable Chl-protein complexes, and stable thylakoid membrane structures, but lost its photosynthetic competence during senescence. The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide. SGR protein was found in both soluble and thylakoid membranes in rice. SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves. Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin. Overexpression of SGR reduced the number of lamellae in the grana thylakoids and reduced the Chl content of normally growing leaves. This indicates that upregulation of SGR increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice. A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in sgr leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence. Some pheophorbide a was detected in sgr leaves in the dark. According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex.
17709752	Mendel's green cotyledon gene encodes a positive regulator of the chlorophyll-degrading pathway.	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Mutants that retain greenness of leaves during senescence are known as "stay-green" mutants. The most famous stay-green mutant is Mendel's green cotyledon pea, one of the mutants used in determining the law of genetics. Pea plants homozygous for this recessive mutation (known as i at present) retain greenness of the cotyledon during seed maturation and of leaves during senescence. We found tight linkage between the I locus and stay-green gene originally found in rice, SGR. Molecular analysis of three i alleles including one with no SGR expression confirmed that the I gene encodes SGR in pea. Functional analysis of sgr mutants in pea and rice further revealed that leaf functionality is lowered despite a high chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) content in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that SGR is primarily involved in Chl degradation. Consistent with this observation, a wide range of Chl-protein complexes, but not the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) large subunit, were shown to be more stable in sgr than wild-type plants. The expression of OsCHL and NYC1, which encode the first enzymes in the degrading pathways of Chl a and Chl b, respectively, was not affected by sgr in rice. The results suggest that SGR might be involved in activation of the Chl-degrading pathway during leaf senescence through translational or posttranslational regulation of Chl-degrading enzymes.
17675402	A germ cell specific gene of the ARGONAUTE family is essential for the progression of premeiotic mitosis and meiosis during sporogenesis in rice.	2007	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains 18 copies of genes of the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family. Although AGO members play important roles in RNA-mediated silencing during plant development, a family member that is specifically involved in sexual reproduction has not been identified in plants. We identified the rice AGO gene MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1) from the analysis of seed-sterile mutants. In the mel1 mutant, chromosome condensation was arrested at early meiotic stages and irregularly sized, multinucleated, and vacuolated pollen mother cells (PMCs) frequently appeared in developing anthers. In addition, histone H3 lysine-9 dimethylation of pericentromeres was rarely reduced and modification of the nucleolar-organizing region was altered in mel1 mutant PMCs. The mutation also affected female germ cell development. These results indicate that the germ cell-specific rice MEL1 gene regulates the cell division of premeiotic germ cells, the proper modification of meiotic chromosomes, and the faithful progression of meiosis, probably via small RNA-mediated gene silencing, but not the initiation and establishment of germ cells themselves.
17999151	A genome-wide survey of HD-Zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	The homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) genes encode transcription factors that have diverse functions in plant development and have often been implicated in stress adaptation. The HD-Zip genes are the most abundant group of homeobox (HB) genes in plants and do not occur in other eukaryotes. This paper describes the complete annotation of the HD-Zip families I, II and III from rice and compares these gene families with Arabidopsis in a phylogeny reconstruction. Orthologous pairs of rice and Arabidopsis HD-Zip genes were predicted based on neighbour joining and maximum parsimony (MP) trees with support of conserved intron-exon organization. Additionally, a number of HD-Zip genes appeared to be unique to rice. Searching of EST and cDNA databases and expression analysis using RT-PCR showed that 30 out of 31 predicted rice HD-Zip genes are expressed. Most HD-Zip genes were broadly expressed in mature plants and seedlings, but others showed more organ specific patterns. Like in Arabidopsis and other dicots, a subset of the rice HD-Zip I and II genes was found to be regulated by drought stress. We identified both drought-induced and drought-repressed HD-Zip genes and demonstrate that these genes are differentially regulated in drought-sensitive versus drought-tolerant rice cultivars. The drought-repressed HD-Zip family I gene, Oshox4, was selected for promoter-GUS analysis, showing that drought-responsiveness of Oshox4 is controlled by the promoter and that Oshox4 expression is predominantly vascular-specific. Loss-of-function analysis of Oshox4 revealed no specific phenotype, but overexpression analysis suggested a role for Oshox4 in elongation and maturation processes.
7915966	A unique sequence located downstream from the rice mitochondrial atp6 may cause male sterility.	1994	Curr Genet	Asymmetric cell-fusion of the japonica cultivar of Oryza sativa (rice) with cytoplasmic-male-sterile (CMS) plants bearing cytoplasm derived from Chinsurah Boro II, resulted in two classes of cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids), fertile and CMS. Southern-blot analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) indicates recombination events around a number of genes; however, the appearance of the CMS character is tightly correlated to reorganization around the atp6 gene, suggesting recombination downstream from the atp6 gene is involved in CMS. The nucleotide sequence downstream from atp6 contains a pseudogene which was probably created by recombination of the mitochondrial genome. Sense and antisense transcripts of the downstream region of atp6 were found in CMS- and restored CMS (fertile)-lines, but not in the normal (fertile) line. In the CMS line, several antisense transcripts of the atp6 gene were also found. However, in the restored line which contains a nuclear-encoded gene, Rf-1, the levels of these transcripts were lower than in the CMS line. These results suggest abnormal transcripts of the atp6 gene produced in the antisense direction may be involved in CMS, and that products of the nuclear-encoded restorer gene may reduce abnormal transcription in this region of the mitochondrial genome.
8595659	High-frequency inter-parental recombination between mitochondrial genomes of rice cybrids.	1995	Curr Genet	Analyzing more than 100 independent rice cybrids, we found evidence for inter-molecular recombination between parental mitochondrial genomes occurring at high frequency soon after protoplast fusion. The structure of the region around the atp6 gene showed extensive polymorphism among Indica (MTC-5A), Japonica (Nipponbare), and wild abortive (IR58024A) mitochondrial genomes. Recombination between the mitochondrial genomes of IR58024A and MTC-5A around the atp6 gene was detected by Southern-blot analysis of cybrid plants. Such recombinant mitochondrial molecules were also cloned from IR58024A/Nipponbare cybrid callus. PCR analysis around the atp6 gene demonstrated that inter-parental recombination occurs in practically all cybrid calli within 2 weeks after protoplast fusion. At this point, parental and recombinant mitochondrial genomes co-existed within the callus. Over the course of further cultivation, however, mitochondrial genome diversity decreased as parental and/or recombinant genomes segregated out.
12527425	Sequence analysis, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the rice vdac family.	2003	Biochim Biophys Acta	The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) is a mitochondrial outer membrane ion channel. Different isoforms exist in plants but information about their specific role remains to be established. Our purpose is to find out the structural features common to three rice VDAC isoforms and to investigate their (post)transcriptional regulation in response to an osmotic stress. Two new cDNAs encoding mitochondrial VDAC from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated, sequenced and characterized: a phylogenetic reconstruction permitted identification of orthologues in Poaceae and computer-based analyses predicted 18 transmembrane beta-strands, one amphipathic alpha-helix and two different phosphorylation motifs. The expression of three rice vdac genes was investigated. Northern blot analyses indicated that they were expressed in all plant tissues. There was a differential expression of osvdac1 and osvdac3, whereas osvdac2 was homogeneously expressed in all tissues. No change in vdac expression was observed under an osmotic stress. However, a fast-enhanced expression of vdac was observed in roots during the recovery period after stress release. This enhanced expression is not correlated to the amount of VDAC protein detected in roots suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation.
18197419	Cloning and characterization of three genes encoding Qb-SNARE proteins in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Qb-SNARE proteins belong to the superfamily of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and function as important components of the vesicle trafficking machinery in eukaryotic cells. Here, we report three novel plant SNARE (NPSN) genes isolated from rice and named OsNPSN11, OsNPSN12 and OsNPSN13. They have about 70% nucleotide identity over their entire coding regions and similar genomic organization with ten exons and nine introns in each gene. Multiple alignment of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the OsNPSNs proteins are homologous to AtNPSNs from Arabidopsis, containing a Qb-SNARE domain and a membrane-spanning domain in the C-terminal region. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays showed that the OsNPSNs were ubiquitously and differentially expressed in roots, culms, leaves, immature spikes and flowering spikes. The expression of OsNPSNs was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H(2)O(2), but down-regulated under NaCl and PEG6000 stresses. Transient expression method in onion epidermal cells revealed that OsNPSNs were located in the plasma membrane. Transformed yeast cells with OsNPSNs had better growth rates than empty-vector transformants when cultured on either solid or liquid selective media containing various concentrations of H(2)O(2), but more sensitive to NaCl and mannitol stresses. The 35S:OsNPSN11 transgenic tobacco also showed more tolerance to H(2)O(2) and sensitivity to NaCl and mannitol than non-transgenic tobacco. These results indicate that OsNPSNs may be involved in different aspects of the signal transduction in plant and yeast responses to abiotic stresses.
17380428	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel SNAP25-type protein gene OsSNAP32 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Mol Biol Rep	The SNAP25-type proteins belong to the superfamily of the SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), and function as important components of the vesical trafficking machinery in eukaryotic cells. In this paper, we report the cloning and expression characterization of OsSNAP32 gene, and the subcellular localization of its encoded protein. The OsSNAP32 gene contains five exons and four introns, and is located between RFLP markers C12276S and S1917 on chromosome 2 in rice. The OsSNAP32 has a molecular weight of 31.3 kD, comprises 283 amino acid residues, and contains Qb-SNARE and Qc-SNARE domains in the N- and C-terminal, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of the SNARE domains indicates that OsSNAP32 protein is homologous to HvSNAP34 and HvSNAP28 (63% and 55% of amino acid identity respectively) from barley. The transient expression method in onion epidermal cells, revealed that OsSNAP32 is located in the plasma membrane, like other SNAP25-type proteins. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed that the OsSNAP32 is highly expressed in leaves and culms, and low in roots of rice, while hardly detected in immature spikes and flowering spikes. The expression of OsSNAP32 was significantly activated in rice seedlings treated with H2O2, PEG6000, and low temperature or after inoculation with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea strain Hoku 1). The results suggest that this gene belongs to a novel member of this gene family encoding SNAP25-type proteins, involved in the rice responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.
17898986	Evaluation of genes from eIF4E and eIF4G multigenic families as potential candidates for partial resistance QTLs to Rice yellow mottle virus in rice.	2007	Theor Appl Genet	QTLs for partial resistance to Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) in rice were mapped in two populations of doubled-haploid lines (DHLs) and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the same cross but evaluated for different resistance criteria (virus content and symptom severity). An integrative map was used to compare the two genetic maps and a global analysis of both populations was performed. Most of the QTLs previously identified in DHL population were confirmed with increased significance and precision. As many recent studies evidenced the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIF) of 4E and 4G families in plant susceptibility to RNA viruses, we checked if these genes co-locate with QTLs of resistance to RYMV. Their systematic in silico identification was carried out on the rice genome and their physical locations were compared to QTL positions on the integrative map. In order to confirm or not the co-locations observed, the analysis was completed by evaluation of near-isogenic lines, QTL fine mapping and sequencing of candidate genes. Three members from eIF4G family could be retained as reliable candidates whereas eIF4E genes, commonly found to govern resistances in other plant/virus interactions, were discarded. Together with the recent identification of an eIF(iso)4G as a major resistance gene, data suggests an important role of genes from eIF4G family in rice resistance to RYMV but does not exclude the contribution of factors different from the translation initiation complex.
18491070	Characterization of the major fragance gene from an aromatic japonica rice and analysis of its diversity in Asian cultivated rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	In Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), aroma is one of the most valuable traits in grain quality and 2-ACP is the main volatile compound contributing to the characteristic popcorn-like odour of aromatic rices. Although the major locus for grain fragrance (frg gene) has been described recently in Basmati rice, this gene has not been characterised in true japonica varieties and molecular information available on the genetic diversity and evolutionary origin of this gene among the different varieties is still limited. Here we report on characterisation of the frg gene in the Azucena variety, one of the few aromatic japonica cultivars. We used a RIL population from a cross between Azucena and IR64, a non-aromatic indica, the reference genomic sequence of Nipponbare (japonica) and 93-11 (indica) as well as an Azucena BAC library, to identify the major fragance gene in Azucena. We thus identified a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, badh2, as the candidate locus responsible for aroma, which presented exactly the same mutation as that identified in Basmati and Jasmine-like rices. Comparative genomic analyses showed very high sequence conservation between Azucena and Nipponbare BADH2, and a MITE was identified in the promotor region of the BADH2 allele in 93-11. The badh2 mutation and MITE were surveyed in a representative rice collection, including traditional aromatic and non-aromatic rice varieties, and strongly suggested a monophylogenetic origin of this badh2 mutation in Asian cultivated rices. Altogether these new data are discussed here in the light of current hypotheses on the origin of rice genetic diversity.
18397370	Functional characterization of two cold shock domain proteins from Oryza sativa.	2008	Plant Cell Environ	Two novel rice cold shock domain (CSD) proteins were cloned and characterized under different stress treatments and during various stages of development. OsCSP1 and OsCSP2 (Oryza sativa CSD protein) encode putative proteins consisting of an N-terminal CSD and glycine-rich regions that are interspersed by 4 and 2 CX(2)CX(4)HX(4)C (CCHC) retroviral-like zinc fingers, respectively. In vivo functional analysis confirmed that OsCSPs can complement a cold-sensitive bacterial strain which lacks four endogenous cold shock proteins. In vitro ssDNA binding assays determined that recombinant OsCSPs are capable of functioning as nucleic acid-binding proteins. Both OsCSP transcripts are transiently up-regulated in response to low-temperature stress and rapidly return to a basal level of gene expression. Protein blot analysis determined that OsCSPs are maintained at a constant level subsequent to a cold treatment lasting over a period of several days. Both the transcript and protein data are in sharp contrast to those previously obtained for winter wheat WCSP1. A time-coursed study through various stages of rice development confirmed that both OsCSP proteins and transcripts are highly accumulated in reproductive tissues and tissues which exhibit meristematic activity.
18182423	Expression of a RING-HC protein from rice improves resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.	2007	J Exp Bot	A cDNA clone (OsRHC1) was obtained, which encodes a novel RING zinc finger protein sharing similar structural features (multiple transmembrane domains at the N-half; a unique RING zinc finger consensus Cys-X(2)-Cys-X(11)-Cys-X-His-X(3)-Cys-X(2)-Cys-X(6)-Cys-X(2)-Cys at the C terminus) to a group of closely related annotated proteins from both monocots and dicots. OsRHC1 was found to be localized on plasma membrane of rice cells and induced by wounding in rice lines containing Xa loci. Ecotopic expression of the OsRHC1 cDNA from rice (a monocot) in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot) enhanced the defence response toward Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, suggesting that OsRHC1 may confer broad-spectrum disease resistance. The protective effects were neutralized in the presence of MG132 or in an npr1-3 mutation background, indicating that the function of OsRHC1 is dependent on the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation via the 26S proteasome and the presence of the key defence response regulator NPR1.

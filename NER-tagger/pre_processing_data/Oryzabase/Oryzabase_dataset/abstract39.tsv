25822501	Interacted QTL mapping in partial NCII design provides evidences for breeding by design.	2015	PLoS One	The utilization of heterosis in rice, maize and rapeseed has revolutionized crop production. Although elite hybrid cultivars are mainly derived from the F1 crosses between two groups of parents, named NCII mating design, little has been known about the methodology of how interacted effects influence quantitative trait performance in the population. To bridge genetic analysis with hybrid breeding, here we integrated an interacted QTL mapping approach with breeding by design in partial NCII mating design. All the potential main and interacted effects were included in one full model. If the number of the effects is huge, bulked segregant analysis were used to test which effects were associated with the trait. All the selected effects were further shrunk by empirical Bayesian, so significant effects could be identified. A series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed to validate the new method. Furthermore, all the significant effects were used to calculate genotypic values of all the missing F1 hybrids, and all these F1 phenotypic or genotypic values were used to predict elite parents and parental combinations. Finally, the new method was adopted to dissect the genetic foundation of oil content in 441 rapeseed parents and 284 F1 hybrids. As a result, 8 main-effect QTL and 37 interacted QTL were found and used to predict 10 elite restorer lines, 10 elite sterile lines and 10 elite parental crosses. Similar results across various methods and in previous studies and a high correlation coefficient (0.76) between the predicted and observed phenotypes validated the proposed method in this study.
25913114	Synthesis and bioactivity of 2',3'-benzoabscisic acid analogs.	2015	Bioorg Med Chem Lett	2',3'-Benzoabscisic acid 4a is significantly more active than (±)-ABA and can be potentially used as a plant growth regulator for agriculture. In this study, six 4a analogs were designed and synthesized. Bioassay showed that 4a displayed greater activity than (±)-ABA and the six analogs produced less inhibition than 4a itself. Specially, some analogs displayed markedly different activities to different physiological and biochemical process, which were largely different from ABA and 4a. Compared to (±)-ABA, 4b and 4c were more effective germination inhibitors for lettuce, but less effective inhibitors for rice elongation. Five-membered analog 5 was higher or slightly weaker in inhibiting Arabidopsis seed germination and rice elongation, respectively, but at least 10 times less effective than (±)-ABA in lettuce seed germination. Dual acid 6 and alkyne acid 20 nearly produced no inhibitory activity for Arabidopsis seed germination, but displayed excellent activity in inhibiting rice seedling growth. The preference of the analogs to different physiology process indicated that they might provide a strategy to develop novel ABA agonists or antagonist and be used as probe to investigate the function of different ABA receptors.
25818072	Physiological, anatomical and transcriptional alterations in a rice mutant leading to enhanced water stress tolerance.	2015	AoB Plants	Water stress is one of the most severe constraints to crop productivity. Plants display a variety of physiological and biochemical responses both at the cellular and whole organism level upon sensing water stress. Leaf rolling, stomatal closure, deeper root penetration, higher relative water content (RWC) and better osmotic adjustment are some of the mechanisms that plants employ to overcome water stress. In the current study, we report a mutant, enhanced water stress tolerant1 (ewst1) with enhanced water stress tolerance, identified from the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant population of rice variety Nagina22 by field screening followed by withdrawal of irrigation in pots and hydroponics (PEG 6000). Though ewst1 was morphologically similar to the wild type (WT) for 35 of the 38 morphological descriptors (except chalky endosperm/expression of white core, decorticated grain colour and grain weight), it showed enhanced germination in polyethylene glycol-infused medium. It exhibited increase in maximum root length without any significant changes in its root weight, root volume and total root number on crown when compared with the WT under stress in PVC tube experiment. It also showed better performance for various physiological parameters such as RWC, cell membrane stability and chlorophyll concentration upon water stress in a pot experiment. Root anatomy and stomatal microscopic studies revealed changes in the number of xylem and phloem cells, size of central meta-xylem and number of closed stomata in ewst1. Comparative genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes related to exocytosis, secondary metabolites, tryptophan biosynthesis, protein phosphorylation and other signalling pathways to be playing a role in enhanced response to water stress in ewst1. The possible involvement of a candidate gene with respect to the observed morpho-physiological and transcriptional changes and its role in stress tolerance are discussed. The mutant identified and characterized in this study will be useful for further dissection of water stress tolerance in rice.
25879964	Development of a waxy gene real-time PCR assay for the quantification of sorghum waxy grain in mixed cereal products.	2015	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Waxy-grain sorghum is used in most of the commercial cereal products in Korea. Worldwide, three waxy mutant alleles have been identified in the sorghum germplasm, and DNA markers for these alleles have been developed to identify the waxy genotype. However, that detection method cannot be used to determine the proportion of waxy content in samples containing both waxy and non-waxy sorghum. This study developed an assay that can be used to detect and quantify the waxy content of mixed cereal samples.

RESULTS: All Korean waxy-grain sorghum used in this study contained the wx (a) allele, and one wx (a) allele-containing individual was also heterozygous for the wx (c) allele. No individuals possessed the wx (b) allele. The genotyping results were confirmed by iodine staining and amylose content analysis. Based on the sequence of the wx (a) allele, three different types of primers (wx (a) allele-specific, non-waxy allele-specific, and nonspecific) were designed for a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay; the primers were evaluated for qPCR using the following criteria: analytical specificity, sensitivity and repeatability. Use of this qPCR assay to analyze mixed cereal products demonstrated that it could accurately detect the waxy content of samples containing both waxy and non-waxy sorghum.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed a qPCR assay to identify and quantify the waxy content of mixed waxy and non-waxy sorghum samples as well as mixtures of cereals including sorghum, rice and barley. The qPCR assay was highly specific; the allele-specific primers did not amplify PCR products from non-target templates. It was also highly sensitive, detecting a tiny amount (>0.5%) of waxy sorghum in the mixed samples; and it was simple and repeatable, implying the robust use of the assay.
25897471	Interactive effects of nitric oxide and glutathione in mitigating copper toxicity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione (GSH) are 2 vital components of the antioxidant system that play diverse roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Recently, we have reported that exogenous supply of both these molecules reduced copper (Cu) toxicity in rice seedlings. Individual as well as co-treatment of sodium nitroprusside (SNP: a NO donor) and GSH with Cu significantly mitigated the adverse effects of Cu, evident in the reduced level of oxidative markers such as H2O2, superoxide (O2(·-)), malondialdehyde (MDA), and proline (Pro). GSH content and most of the antioxidative and glyoxalase enzymes were up-regulated upon Cu stress, indicating their responses were co-related with the level of stress. Our results indicated that direct ROS scavenging, reduced Cu uptake, and the balanced antioxidative and glyoxalase systems, at least in part, successfully executed NO- and GSH-mediated alleviation of Cu toxicity in rice seedlings. In addition, the combined effect of adding SNP and GSH together was more efficient than the effect of adding them individually. Here, we are speculating that 1) GSH and Pro could be used as potential markers for copper stress, and 2) adding SNP and GSH might produce S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) which could be a source of bioactive NO and may affect many regulatory processes involved in Cu-stress tolerance. We further note that the combined effect of adding SNP and GSH was pronounced in inhibiting the uptake and translocation of Cu in rice seedlings.
25789629	Time-course association mapping of the grain-filling rate in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Detecting quantity trait locus (QTLs) and elite alleles that are associated with grain-filling rate (GFR) in rice is essential for promoting the utilization of hybrid japonica rice and improving rice yield. Ninety-five varieties including 58 landraces and 37 elite varieties from the core germplasm collection were genotyped with 263 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The GFR of the 95 varieties was evaluated at five stages, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days after flowering (DAF) both in 2011 and 2012. We found abundant phenotypic and genetic diversity in the studied population. A population structure analysis identified seven subpopulations. A linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that the levels of LD ranged from 60.3 cM to 84.8 cM and artificial selection had enhanced the LD. A time-course association analysis detected 31 marker-GFR associations involving 24 SSR markers located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of rice at five stages. The elite alleles for high GFR at each stage were detected. Fifteen excellent parental combinations were predicted, and the best parental combination 'Nannongjing62401×Laolaihong' could theoretically increase 4.086 mg grain(-1) d(-1) at the five stages. Our results demonstrate that the time-course association mapping for GFR in rice could detect elite alleles at different filling stages and that these elite alleles could be used to improve the GFR via pyramiding breeding.
25807168	Nucleotide diversity analysis of three major bacterial blight resistance genes in rice.	2015	PLoS One	Nucleotide sequence polymorphisms among R gene alleles influence the process of co-evolutionary interaction between host and pathogen by shaping the response of host plants towards invading pathogens. Here, we present the DNA sequence polymorphisms and diversities present among natural alleles of three rice bacterial blight resistance genes, Xa21, Xa26 and xa5. The diversity was examined across different wild relatives and cultivars of Oryza species. Functional significance of selected alleles was evaluated through semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and real time PCR. The greatest nucleotide diversity and singleton variable sites (SVS) were present in Xa26 (π = 0.01958; SVS = 182) followed by xa5 and Xa21 alleles. The highest frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in Xa21 alleles and least in xa5. Transition bias was observed in all the genes and 'G' to 'A' transitions were more favored than other form of transitions. Neutrality tests failed to show the presence of selection at these loci, though negative Tajima's D values indicate the presence of a rare form of polymorphisms. At the interspecies level, O. nivara exhibited more diversity than O. sativa. We have also identified two nearly identical resistant alleles of xa5 and two sequentially identical alleles of Xa21. The alleles of xa5 showed basal levels of expression while Xa21 alleles were functionally not expressed.
25747843	Genetic Architecture of Natural Variation in Rice Chlorophyll Content Revealed by a Genome-Wide Association Study.	2015	Mol Plant	Chlorophyll content is one of the most important physiological traits as it is closely related to leaf photosynthesis and crop yield potential. So far, few genes have been reported to be involved in natural variation of chlorophyll content in rice (Oryza sativa) and the extent of variations explored is very limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a diverse worldwide collection of 529 O. sativa accessions. A total of 46 significant association loci were identified. Three F2 mapping populations with parents selected from the association panel were tested for validation of GWAS signals. We clearly demonstrated that Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) was a major locus for natural variation of chlorophyll content at the heading stage by combining evidence from near-isogenic lines and transgenic plants. The enhanced expression of Ghd7 decreased the chlorophyll content, mainly through down-regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chloroplast. In addition, Narrow leaf1 (NAL1) corresponded to one significant association region repeatedly detected over two years. We revealed a high degree of polymorphism in the 5' UTR and four non-synonymous SNPs in the coding region of NAL1, and observed diverse effects of the major haplotypes. The loci or candidate genes identified would help to fine-tune and optimize the antenna size of canopies in rice breeding.
25690040	Comprehensive analysis suggests overlapping expression of rice ONAC transcription factors in abiotic and biotic stress responses.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	NAC (NAM/ATAF/CUC) transcription factors comprise a large plant-specific gene family that contains more than 149 members in rice. Extensive studies have revealed that NAC transcription factors not only play important roles in plant growth and development, but also have functions in regulation of responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, biological functions for most of the members in the NAC family remain unknown. In this study, microarray data analyses revealed that a total of 63 ONAC genes exhibited overlapping expression patterns in rice under various abiotic (salt, drought, and cold) and biotic (infection by fungal, bacterial, viral pathogens, and parasitic plants) stresses. Thirty-eight ONAC genes exhibited overlapping expression in response to any two abiotic stresses, among which 16 of 30 selected ONAC genes were upregulated in response to exogenous ABA. Sixty-five ONAC genes showed overlapping expression patterns in response to any two biotic stresses. Results from the present study suggested that members of the ONAC genes with overlapping expression pattern may have pleiotropic biological functions in regulation of defense response against different abiotic and biotic stresses, which provide clues for further functional analysis of the ONAC genes in stress tolerance and pathogen resistance.
25697955	Differential regulation of genes by retrotransposons in rice promoters.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Rice genome harbors genes and promoters with retrotransposon insertions. There is very little information about their function. The effect of retrotransposon insertions in four rice promoter regions on gene regulation, was investigated using promoter-reporter gene constructs with and without retrotransposons. Differences in expression levels of gus and egfp reporter genes in forward orientation and rfp in reverse orientation were evaluated in rice plants with transient expression employing quantitative RT-PCR analysis, histochemical GUS staining, and eGFP and RFP fluorescent microscopy. The presence of SINE in the promoter 1 (P1) resulted in higher expression levels of the reporter genes, whereas the presence of LINE in P2 or gypsy LTR retrotransposon in P3 reduced expression of the reporter genes. Furthermore, the SINE in P1 acts as an enhancer in contrast with the LINE in P2 and the gypsy LTR retrotransposon in P3 which act as silencers. CTAA and CGG motifs in these retrotransposons are the likely candidates for the downregulation compared to TCTT motif (SINE) which is a candidate for the upregulation of gene expression. The effect of retrotransposons on gene regulation correlated with the earlier investigation of conservation patterns of these four retrotransposon insertions in several rice accessions implying their evolutionary significance.
25732386	Variations between the photosynthetic properties of elite and landrace Chinese rice cultivars revealed by simultaneous measurements of 820 nm transmission signal and chlorophyll a fluorescence induction.	2015	J Plant Physiol	The difference between the photosynthetic properties of elite and landrace Chinese rice cultivars was studied, using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction (mostly a monitor of Photosystem II activity) and I820 transmission signal (mostly a monitor of Photosystem I activity) to identify potential photosynthetic features differentiating these two groups, which show different degrees of artificial selection and grain yields. A higher fluorescence (related to PSII) IP rise phase and a lower P700(+) (related to PSI) accumulation were observed in the elite cultivars as compared to the landraces. Using these data, together with simulation data from a kinetic model of fluorescence induction, we show that the high IP rise phase and the low P700(+) accumulation can be a result of transient block on electron transfer and traffic jam on the electron acceptor side of PSI under a high [NADPH]/[NADP(+)] ratio. Considering that the ferredoxin NADP(+) reductase (FNR) transcript levels of XS134 (a representative elite cultivars) remains unaffected during the first few minutes of light/dark transition compared to Q4145 (a representative landrace cultivars), which shows a strong decline during the same time range, we propose that the FNR of elite cultivars may take more time to be inactivated in darkness. During this time the FNR enzyme can continue to reduce NADP(+) molecules, leading to initially high [NADPH]/[NADP(+)] ratio during OJIP transient. These data suggested a potential artificial selection of FNR during the breeding process of these examined elite rice cultivars.
25755661	B-GATA transcription factors - insights into their structure, regulation, and role in plant development.	2015	Front Plant Sci	GATA transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators that recognize promoter elements with a G-A-T-A core sequence. In comparison to animal genomes, the GATA transcription factor family in plants is comparatively large with approximately 30 members. Here, we review the current knowledge on B-GATAs, one of four GATA factor subfamilies from Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that B-GATAs can be subdivided based on structural features and their biological function into family members with a C-terminal LLM- (leucine-leucine-methionine) domain or an N-terminal HAN- (HANABA TARANU) domain. The paralogous GNC (GATA, NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, CARBON-METABOLISM INVOLVED) and CGA1/GNL (CYTOKININ-INDUCED GATA1/GNC-LIKE) are introduced as LLM-domain containing B-GATAs from Arabidopsis that control germination, greening, senescence, and flowering time downstream from several growth regulatory signals. Arabidopsis HAN and its monocot-specific paralogs from rice (NECK LEAF1), maize (TASSEL SHEATH1), and barley (THIRD OUTER GLUME) are HAN-domain-containing B-GATAs with a predominant role in embryo development and floral development. We also review GATA23, a regulator of lateral root initiation from Arabidopsis that is closely related to GNC and GNL but has a degenerate LLM-domain that is seemingly specific for the Brassicaceae family. The Brassicaceae-specific GATA23 and the monocot-specific HAN-domain GATAs provide evidence that neofunctionalization of B-GATAs was used during plant evolution to expand the functional repertoire of these transcription factors.
25888265	Identification of new members of the MAPK gene family in plants shows diverse conserved domains and novel activation loop variants.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling is of critical importance in plants and other eukaryotic organisms. The MAPK cascade plays an indispensible role in the growth and development of plants, as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. The MAPKs are constitute the most downstream module of the three tier MAPK cascade and are phosphorylated by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), which are in turn are phosphorylated by MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). The MAPKs play pivotal roles in regulation of many cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, thus regulating several biological processes.

RESULTS: A total of 589 MAPKs genes were identified from the genome wide analysis of 40 species. The sequence analysis has revealed the presence of several N- and C-terminal conserved domains. The MAPKs were previously believed to be characterized by the presence of TEY/TDY activation loop motifs. The present study showed that, in addition to presence of activation loop TEY/TDY motifs, MAPKs are also contain MEY, TEM, TQM, TRM, TVY, TSY, TEC and TQY activation loop motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of all predicted MAPKs were clustered into six different groups (group A, B, C, D, E and F), and all predicted MAPKs were assigned with specific names based on their orthology based evolutionary relationships with Arabidopsis or Oryza MAPKs.

CONCLUSION: We conducted global analysis of the MAPK gene family of plants from lower eukaryotes to higher eukaryotes and analyzed their genomic and evolutionary aspects. Our study showed the presence of several new activation loop motifs and diverse conserved domains in MAPKs. Advance study of newly identified activation loop motifs can provide further information regarding the downstream signaling cascade activated in response to a wide array of stress conditions, as well as plant growth and development.
25815311	Genome-wide identification, evolutionary, and expression analyses of histone H3 variants in plants.	2015	Biomed Res Int	Histone variants alter the nucleosome structure and play important roles in chromosome segregation, transcription, DNA repair, and sperm compaction. Histone H3 is encoded by many genes in most eukaryotic species and is the histone that contains the largest variety of posttranslational modifications. Compared with the metazoan H3 variants, little is known about the complex evolutionary history of H3 variants proteins in plants. Here, we study the identification, evolutionary, and expression analyses of histone H3 variants from genomes in major branches in the plant tree of life. Firstly we identified all the histone three related (HTR) genes from the examined genomes, then we classified the four groups variants: centromeric H3, H3.1, H3.3 and H3-like, by phylogenetic analysis, intron information, and alignment. We further demonstrated that the H3 variants have evolved under strong purifying selection, indicating the conservation of HTR proteins. Expression analysis revealed that the HTR has a wide expression profile in maize and rice development and plays important roles in development.
25644581	Genetic engineering of the Xa10 promoter for broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Many pathovars of plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas species inject transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into plant host cells to promote disease susceptibility or trigger disease resistance. The rice TAL effector-dependent disease resistance gene Xa10 confers narrow-spectrum race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight disease in rice. To generate broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xoo, we developed a modified Xa10 gene, designated as Xa10(E5) . Xa10(E5) has an EBE-amended promoter containing 5 tandemly arranged EBEs each responding specifically to a corresponding virulent or avirulent TAL effector and a stable transgenic rice line containing Xa10(E5) was generated in the cultivar Nipponbare. The Xa10(E5) gene was specifically induced by Xoo strains that harbour the corresponding TAL effectors and conferred TAL effector-dependent resistance to the pathogens at all developmental stages of rice. Further disease evaluation demonstrated that the Xa10(E5) gene in either Nipponbare or 9311 genetic backgrounds provided broad-spectrum disease resistance to 27 of the 28 Xoo strains collected from 11 countries. The development of Xa10(E5) and transgenic rice lines provides new genetic materials for molecular breeding of rice for broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance to bacterial blight.
25844116	Molecular breeding of thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines of rice for blast resistance using Pi2 gene.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the big problems in rice production in China, especially for high yield hybrid varieties made from a two-line system in which thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines are used. In this study, we report the introgression of a rice blast resistance gene Pi2 from VE6219 into C815S, an elite rice TGMS line, leading to the development of blast resistant TGMS lines through marker assisted selection (MAS) and phenotypic selection approaches.

RESULTS: Four new TGMS lines with blast resistance gene Pi2 were developed from C815S (an elite TGMS line susceptible to the blast, used as recurrent parent) and VE6219 (a blast resistant line harboring Pi2, used as donor parent). The pathogenicity assays inoculated with 53 blast prevalent isolates in glasshouse showed that the blast resistant frequency of the four TGMS lines was 94.3%-98.1% that is equivalent to blast resistant donor parent VE6219. The field evaluation of the new lines and hybrids made from them at a blast epidemic site also showed high resistant levels against the blast. The genetic background of the newly developed TGMS lines were examined using a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array (RICE6K) that turned out more than 83% of the genomic markers were derived from the recurrent parent. The critical temperature points of fertility-sterility alteration of the new TGMS lines were between 22°C and 23°C of daily mean temperature, which is similar to that of C815S. The complete male sterility under natural growth conditions at Wuhan last more than 80 days. Their agronomic and grain quality traits meet the requirement for two-line hybrid rice production.

CONCLUSIONS: The broad-spectrum and durable rice blast resistant gene Pi2 was introgressed into the elite TGMS line C815S background. The newly developed TGMS lines can be practically used for two-line hybrid rice breeding and must play an important role in sustainable rice production in China.
25713176	Structural Requirements of Strigolactones for Shoot Branching Inhibition in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The structural requirements of strigolactones (SLs) involved in germination induction of root parasitic plants and hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been extensively studied. However, our knowledge of the requirements of SLs involved in shoot branching inhibition in plants is still limited. To address this question, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of SLs in shoot branching inhibition in rice and Arabidopsis. SLs possess a four-ring structure, with a tricyclic lactone (ABC-rings) connected to a methylbutenolide part (D-ring) via an enol ether bridge. Here, we show that the the (R) configuration at C-2', which determines the steric position of the D-ring relative to the enol ether olefin bond, is critical for the hormonal activity in rice. Replacement of the enol ether moiety by an alkoxy or imino ether resulted in a severe reduction in biological activity in rice. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid experiments using a possible SL receptor, DWARF14 (D14), and a repressor in the SL signaling pathway, DWARF53 (D53), showed that D14 can interact with D53 in the presence of (2'R) stereoisomers of SLs, but not (2'S) stereoisomers, suggesting that the stereostructure of SLs is crucial for the interaction of these proteins. When GR5, an AB-ring-truncated analog, was applied to the hydroponic culture medium, strong inhibition of shoot branching was observed both in rice and in Arabidopsis. However, GR5 was only weakly active when directly applied to the axillary buds of Arabidopsis. Our results indicate that the difference in plant species and application methods greatly influences the apparent SL biological activity.
25663113	In silico characterization and analysis of RTBP1 and NgTRF1 protein through MD simulation and molecular docking - A comparative study.	2015	Interdiscip Sci	Gaining access to sequence and structure information of telomere binding proteins helps in understanding the essential biological processes involve in conserved sequence specific interaction between DNA and the proteins. Rice telomere binding protein (RTBP1) and Nicotiana glutinosa telomere repeat binding factor (NgTRF1) are helix turn helix motif type of proteins that plays role in telomeric DNA protection and length regulation. Both the proteins share same type of domain but till now there is very less communication on the in silico studies of these complete proteins.Here we intend to do a comparative study between two proteins through modeling of the complete proteins, physiochemical characterization, MD simulation and DNA-protein docking. I-TASSER and CLC protein work bench was performed to find out the protein 3D structure as well as the different parameters to characterize the proteins. MD simulation was completed by GROMOS forcefield of GROMACS for 10 ns of time stretch. The simulated 3D structures were docked with template DNA (3D DNA modeled through 3D-DART) of TTTAGGG conserved sequence motif using HADDOCK web server.Digging up all the facts about the proteins it was reveled that around 120 amino acids in the tail part was showing a good sequence similarity between the proteins. Molecular modeling, sequence characterization and secondary structure prediction also indicates the similarity between the protein's structure and sequence. The result of MD simulation highlights on the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, PCA and Energy plots which also conveys the similar type of motional behavior between them. The best complex formation for both the proteins in docking result also indicates for the first interaction site which is mainly the helix3 region of the DNA binding domain. The overall computational analysis reveals that RTBP1 and NgTRF1 proteins display good amount of similarity in their physicochemical properties, structure, dynamics and binding mode.
25887533	Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive male sterile rice Peiai 64S.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications play important roles in the regulation of plant development. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that dynamically regulates gene expression during developmental processes. However, little studies have been reported about the methylation profiles of photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) rice during the fertility transition.

RESULTS: In this study, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq), the global DNA methylation patterns were compared in the rice PTGMS line PA64S under two different environments (different temperatures and day lengths). The profiling of the DNA methylation under two different phenotypes (sterility and fertility) revealed that hypermethylation was observed in PA64S (sterility), and 1258 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found between PA64S (sterility) and PA64S (fertility). Twenty differentially methylated genes of them were further validated through bisulfite sequencing, and four of these genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Especially, a differentially methylated gene (LOC_Os08g38210), which encoded transcription factor BIM2, is a component of brassinosteroid signaling in rice. The hypermethylated BIM2 gene may suppress some downstream genes in brassinosteroid signaling pathway, and thus affect the male fertility in PA64S.

CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here indicated that hypermethylation was observed in PA64S (sterility). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG analysis revealed that flavone and flavonol biosynthrsis, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were involved in sterility-fertility transition of PA64S.
25658451	The RhoGAP SPIN6 associates with SPL11 and OsRac1 and negatively regulates programmed cell death and innate immunity in rice.	2015	PLoS Pathog	The ubiquitin proteasome system in plants plays important roles in plant-microbe interactions and in immune responses to pathogens. We previously demonstrated that the rice U-box E3 ligase SPL11 and its Arabidopsis ortholog PUB13 negatively regulate programmed cell death (PCD) and defense response. However, the components involved in the SPL11/PUB13-mediated PCD and immune signaling pathway remain unknown. In this study, we report that SPL11-interacting Protein 6 (SPIN6) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that interacts with SPL11 in vitro and in vivo. SPL11 ubiquitinates SPIN6 in vitro and degrades SPIN6 in vivo via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Both RNAi silencing in transgenic rice and knockout of Spin6 in a T-DNA insertion mutant lead to PCD and increased resistance to the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The levels of reactive oxygen species and defense-related gene expression are significantly elevated in both the Spin6 RNAi and mutant plants. Strikingly, SPIN6 interacts with the small GTPase OsRac1, catalyze the GTP-bound OsRac1 into the GDP-bound state in vitro and has GAP activity towards OsRac1 in rice cells. Together, our results demonstrate that the RhoGAP SPIN6 acts as a linkage between a U-box E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination pathway and a small GTPase-associated defensome system for plant immunity.
25648443	Comparative proteomics reveals differential induction of both biotic and abiotic stress response associated proteins in rice during Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection.	2015	Funct Integr Genomics	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight disease in rice and brutally affects the yield up to 50 % of total production. Here, we report a comparative proteomics analysis of total foliar protein isolated from infected rice leaves of susceptible Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) and resistant Oryza longistaminata genotypes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) approaches identified 29 protein spots encoding unique proteins from both the genotypes. Identified proteins belonged to a large number of biological and molecular functions related to biotic and abiotic stress proteins which are potentially involved during Xoo infection. Biotic and abiotic stress-related proteins were induced during Xoo infection, indicating the activation of common stress pathway during bacterial blight infection. Candidate genes conferring tolerance against bacterial blight, which include germin-like protein, putative r40c1, cyclin-dependent kinase C, Ent-isokaur-15-ene synthase and glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase 1 (GSH-DHAR1), were also induced, with germin-like proteins induced only in the resistant rice genotype O. longistaminata. Energy, metabolism and hypothetical proteins were common among both the genotypes. Further, host defence/stress-related proteins were mostly expressed in resistant genotype O. longistaminata, indicating possible co-evolution of the pathogen and the wild rice, O. longistaminata.
25735982	Differential antioxidant defense and detoxification mechanisms in photodynamically stressed rice plants treated with the deregulators of porphyrin biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinic acid and oxyfluorfen.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	This study focuses on differential molecular mechanisms of antioxidant and detoxification systems in rice plants under two different types of photodynamic stress imposed by porphyrin deregulators, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and oxyfluorfen (OF). The ALA-treated plants with white necrosis exhibited a greater decrease in photochemical quantum efficiency, Fv/Fm, as well as a greater increase in activity of superoxide dismutase, compared to the OF-treated plants. By contrast, the brown necrosis in OF-treated plants resulted in not only more widely dispersed H2O2 production and greater increases in H2O2-decomposing enzymes, catalase and peroxidase, but also lower ascorbate redox state. In addition, ALA- and OF-treated plants markedly up-regulated transcript levels of genes involved in detoxification processes including transport and movement, cellular homeostasis, and xenobiotic conjugation, with prominent up-regulation of serine/threonine kinase and chaperone only in ALA-treated plants. Our results demonstrate that different photodynamic stress imposed by ALA and OF developed differential actions of antioxidant enzymes and detoxification. Particularly, detoxification system may play potential roles in plant protection against photodynamic stress imposed by porphyrin deregulators, thereby contributing to alleviation of photodynamic damage.
25658704	Characterization of a null allelic mutant of the rice NAL1 gene reveals its role in regulating cell division.	2015	PLoS One	Leaf morphology is closely associated with cell division. In rice, mutations in Narrow leaf 1 (NAL1) show narrow leaf phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that NAL1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown. In this report, we characterized two allelic mutants of NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), nal1-2 and nal1-3, both of which showed a 50% reduction in leaf width and length, as well as a dwarf culm. Longitudinal and transverse histological analyses of leaves and internodes revealed that cell division was suppressed in the anticlinal orientation but enhanced in the periclinal orientation in the mutants, while cell size remained unaltered. In addition to defects in cell proliferation, the mutants showed abnormal midrib in leaves. Map-based cloning revealed that nal1-2 is a null allelic mutant of NAL1 since both the whole promoter and a 404-bp fragment in the first exon of NAL1 were deleted, and that a 6-bp fragment was deleted in the mutant nal1-3. We demonstrated that NAL1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation. The altered transcript level of G1- and S-phase-specific genes suggested that NAL1 affects cell cycle regulation. Heterogeneous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that NAL1 affects cell division. These results suggest that NAL1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division.
25804816	Dissecting root proteome of transgenic rice cultivars unravels metabolic alterations and accumulation of novel stress responsive proteins under drought stress.	2015	Plant Sci	Generation of drought tolerant rice plants by overexpressing Arabidopsis DREB1A is a significant development for abiotic stress research. However, the metabolic network regulated in the drought tolerant transgenic rice plants is poorly understood. In this research study, we have demonstrated the comparative proteome analysis between the roots of wild type and transgenic DREB1A overexpressing homozygous plants under drought stress condition. After 7d of dehydration stress at reproductive stage, the plants were re-watered for 24h. The roots were collected separately from wild type and transgenic plants grown under water, drought stress and re-watering conditions and total proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Among the large number of differentially accumulated spots, 30, 27 and 20 spots were successfully identified as differentially expressed proteins in three different conditions respectively. The major class of identified proteins belongs to carbohydrate and energy metabolism category while stress and defense related proteins are especially up-accumulated under drought stress in both the plants. A novel protein, R40C1 was reported to be up-accumulated in roots of transgenic plants which may play an important role in generation of drought tolerant plants. Protein-protein interaction helps to identify the network of drought stress signaling pathways.
25728666	COLD1 confers chilling tolerance in rice.	2015	Cell	Rice is sensitive to cold and can be grown only in certain climate zones. Human selection of japonica rice has extended its growth zone to regions with lower temperature, while the molecular basis of this adaptation remains unknown. Here, we identify the quantitative trait locus COLD1 that confers chilling tolerance in japonica rice. Overexpression of COLD1(jap) significantly enhances chilling tolerance, whereas rice lines with deficiency or downregulation of COLD1(jap) are sensitive to cold. COLD1 encodes a regulator of G-protein signaling that localizes on plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with the G-protein α subunit to activate the Ca(2+) channel for sensing low temperature and to accelerate G-protein GTPase activity. We further identify that a SNP in COLD1, SNP2, originated from Chinese Oryza rufipogon, is responsible for the ability of COLD(jap/ind) to confer chilling tolerance, supporting the importance of COLD1 in plant adaptation.
25730062	Natural variation of rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Studying natural variation in rice resistance genes of cultivated and wild rice relatives can predict resistance stability to rice blast fungus. In the present study, the protein coding regions of the rice R gene Pi-d2 in 35 rice accessions, including Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica Kato (Aus), indica (IND), temperate japonica (TEJ), tropical japonica (TRJ), aromatic (ARO); subgroups of Oryza sativa; 6 accessions of wild rice varieties; O. nivara; and O. rufipogon were analyzed. A total of 13 nucleotide differences were found in the open reading frames (ORFs) of Pi-d2. Translation of these ORFs revealed 9 variants; 3 were novel Pi-d2 variants. Variants H2 and H5 were identified in accessions of cultivated rice and O. nivara, H1, H3, H4, H6, and H8 were only identified in cultivated rice. H2 and H5 were the common types of IND and O. nivara, H8 was the common type of TRJ and AUS, H6 was the specific type of AUS, and H3 was the specific type of ARO. H7 and H9 were specific haplotypes of O. nivara and O. rufipogon, respectively. These findings demonstrate that Pi-d2 variants are useful indicators for each subgroup, and Pi-d2 is an ancient gene that predates speciation of rice subgroups.
25659573	Comparative genomics identifies the Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector AvrPi9 that triggers Pi9-mediated blast resistance in rice.	2015	New Phytol	We identified the Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector AvrPi9 cognate to rice blast resistance gene Pi9 by comparative genomics of requisite strains derived from a sequential planting method. AvrPi9 encodes a small secreted protein that appears to localize in the biotrophic interfacial complex and is translocated to the host cell during rice infection. AvrPi9 forms a tandem gene array with its paralogue proximal to centromeric region of chromosome 7. AvrPi9 is expressed highly at early stages during initiation of blast disease. Virulent isolate strains contain Mg-SINE within the AvrPi9 coding sequence. Loss of AvrPi9 did not lead to any discernible defects during growth or pathogenesis in M. oryzae. This study reiterates the role of diverse transposable elements as off-switch agents in acquisition of gain-of-virulence in the rice blast fungus. The prevalence of AvrPi9 correlates well with the avirulence pathotype in diverse blast isolates from the Philippines and China, thus supporting the broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Pi9 in different rice growing areas. Our results revealed that Pi9 and Piz-t at the Pi2/9 locus activate race specific resistance by recognizing sequence-unrelated AvrPi9 and AvrPiz-t genes, respectively.
25674802	1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate Deaminase from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 Facilitates the Growth of Rice in the Presence of Salt or Heavy Metals.	2015	J Microbiol Biotechnol	1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which is encoded by some bacteria, can reduce the amount of ethylene, a root elongation inhibitor, and stimulate the growth of plants under various environmental stresses. The presence of ACC deaminase activity and the regulation of ACC in several rhizospheric bacteria have been reported. The nitrogen-fixing Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 is capable of endophytic association with rice plants and promotes the growth of rice. However, the functional identification of ACC deaminase has not been performed. In this study, the proposed effect of ACC deaminase in P. stutzeri A1501 was investigated. Genome mining showed that P. stutzeri A1501 carries a single gene encoding ACC deaminase, designated acdS. The acdS mutant was devoid of ACC deaminase activity and was less resistant to NaCl and NiCl2 compared with the wild-type. Furthermore, inactivation of acdS greatly impaired its nitrogenase activity under salt stress conditions. It was also observed that mutation of the acdS gene led to loss of the ability to promote the growth of rice under salt or heavy metal stress. Taken together, this study illustrates the essential role of ACC deaminase, not only in enhancing the salt or heavy metal tolerance of bacteria but also in improving the growth of plants, and provides a theoretical basis for studying the interaction between plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and plants.
25657119	Genetic manipulation of a high-affinity PHR1 target cis-element to improve phosphorous uptake in Oryza sativa L.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for crop development and production. Phosphate starvation response 1 (PHR1) acts as the central regulator for Pi-signaling and Pi-homeostasis in plants by binding to the cis-element PHR1 binding sequence (P1BS; GNATATNC). However, how phosphate starvation-induced gene expression is regulated remains obscure. In this work, we investigated the DNA binding affinity of the PHR1 ortholog OsPHR2 to its downstream target genes in Oryza sativa (rice). We confirmed that a combination of P1BS and P1BS-like motifs are essential for stable binding by OsPHR2. Furthermore, we report that variations in P1BS motif bases affected the binding affinity of OsPHR2 and that the highest affinity motif was GaATATtC (designated the A-T-type P1BS). We also found that a combination of two A-T-type P1BS elements in tandem, namely HA-P1BS, was very efficient for binding of OsPHR2. Using the cis-regulator HA-P1BS, we modified the promoters of Transporter Traffic Facilitator 1 (PHF1), a key factor controlling endoplasmic reticulum-exit of phosphate transporters to the plasma membrane, for efficient uptake of phosphorous in an energetically neutral way. Transgenic plants with the modified promoters showed significantly enhanced tolerance to low phosphate stress in both solution and soil conditions, which provides a new strategy for crop improvement to enhance tolerance of nutrient deficiency.
25752430	The effects of triazophos applied to transgenic Bt rice on the nutritional indexes, Nlvg expression, and population growth of Nilaparvata lugens Stål under elevated CO₂.	2015	Pestic Biochem Physiol	The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is a typical pest in which population resurgence can be induced by insecticides. Warmer global temperatures, associated with anthropogenic climate change, are likely to have marked ecological effects on terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) concentrations on the resurgence of N. lugens that have been treated with pesticides used for transgenic Bt rice cultivation are not fully understood. The present study investigated changes in the protein content, soluble sugar content, free amino acid level, vitellogenin (Nlvg) mRNA expression, and the population growth of N. lugens on transgenic Bt rice (TT51) following triazaophos foliar spray under conditions of eCO2. The results showed that the protein content in the fat bodies and ovaries of N. lugens adult females in TT51 treated with 40 ppm triazophos under eCO2 was significantly higher than under ambient CO2 (aCO2) and was also higher than that in females feeding on the non-transgenic parent (MH63) under aCO2 at different days after emergence (DAEs). The soluble sugar content and free amino level of adult females in TT51 treated with 40 ppm triazophos under eCO2 was significantly higher than under aCO2 and was also higher than in MH63 under aCO2 at 1 and 3 DAE. The Nlvg mRNA expression level of N. lugens adult females in TT51 treated with 40 ppm triazophos under eCO2 was significantly higher than under aCO2 and was also higher than in MH63 under aCO2 at 1 and 3 DAE. The population number of N. lugens in TT51 treated with 40 ppm triazophos under eCO2 was significantly higher than under aCO2 and was also higher than in MH63 under aCO2. The present findings provide important information for integrated pest management with transgenic varieties and a better understanding of the resurgence mechanism of N. lugens under eCO2.
25638043	Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of the late embryogenesis abundant genes in potato with emphasis on dehydrins.	2015	Mol Biol Rep	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins were first described as accumulating late in plant seed development. They were also shown to be involved in plant responses to environmental stress and as well as in bacteria, yeast and invertebrates. They are known to play crucial roles in dehydration tolerance. This study describes a genome-wide analysis of LEA proteins and the corresponding genes in Solanum tuberosum. Twenty-nine LEA family members encoding genes in the Solanum genome were identified. Phylogenetic analyses allowed the classification of the potato LEA proteins into nine distinct groups. Some of them were identified as putative orthologs of Arabidopsis and rice LEA genes. In silico analyses confirmed the hydrophilicity of most of the StLEA proteins, whereas some of them can be folded. The in silico expression analyses showed that the identified genes displayed tissue-specific, stress and hormone-responsive expression profiles. Five StLEA classified as dehydrins were selected for expression analyses under salt and drought stresses. The data revealed that they were induced by both stresses. The analyses indicate that several factors such us developmental stages, hormones, and dehydration, can regulate the expression and activities of LEA protein. This report can be helpful for the further functional diversity studies and analyses of LEA proteins in potato. These genes can be overexpressed to improve potato abiotic stress response.
25651892	Transcriptome profiling of Bacillus subtilis OKB105 in response to rice seedlings.	2015	BMC Microbiol	BACKGROUND: Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are soil beneficial microorganisms that colonize plant roots for nutritional purposes and accordingly benefit plants by increasing plant growth or reducing disease. However, the mechanisms and pathways involved in the interactions between PGPR and plants remain unclear. In order to better understand these complex plant-PGPR interactions, changes in the transcriptome of the typical PGPR Bacillus subtilis in response to rice seedlings were analyzed.

RESULTS: Microarray technology was used to study the global transcriptionl response of B. subtilis OKB105 to rice seedlings after an interaction period of 2 h. A total of 176 genes representing 3.8% of the B. subtilis strain OKB105 transcriptome showed significantly altered expression levels in response to rice seedlings. Among these, 52 were upregulated, the majority of which are involved in metabolism and transport of nutrients, and stress responses, including araA, ywkA, yfls, mtlA, ydgG et al. The 124 genes that were downregulated included cheV, fliL, spmA and tua, and these are involved in chemotaxis, motility, sporulation and teichuronic acid biosynthesis, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: We present a transcriptome analysis of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis OKB105 in response to rice seedings. Many of the 176 differentially expressed genes are likely to be involved in the interaction between Gram-positive bacteria and plants.
25719552	Low pH-induced changes of antioxidant enzyme and ATPase activities in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2015	PLoS One	Soil acidification is the main problem in the current rice production. Here, the effects of low pH on the root growth, reactive oxygen species metabolism, plasma membrane functions, and the transcript levels of the related genes were investigated in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) in a hydroponic system at pH 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5. There were two hybrid rice cultivars in this trial, including Yongyou 12 (YY12, a japonica hybrid) and Zhongzheyou 1 (ZZY1, an indica hybrid). Higher H+ activity markedly decreased root length, the proportion of fine roots, and dry matter production, but induced a significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and led to serious lipid peroxidation in the roots of the two varieties. The transcript levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (Cu/Zn SOD1), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 2 (Cu/Zn SOD2), catalase A (CATA) and catalase B (CATB) genes in YY12 and ZZY1 roots were significantly down-regulated after low pH exposure for two weeks. Meanwhile, a significant decrease was observed in the expression of the P-type Ca2+-ATPases in roots at pH 3.5. The activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) and plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+-ATPase in the two varieties were dramatically inhibited by strong rhizosphere acidification. However, the expression levels of ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) and PM H+-ATPase isoform 7 were up-regulated under H+ stress compared with the control. Significantly higher activities of APX and PM H+-ATPase could contribute to the adaptation of rice roots to low pH.
25647350	Curved chimeric palea 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	2015	Plant J	Floral organ specification is controlled by various MADS-box genes in both dicots and monocots, whose expression is often subjected to both genetic and epigenetic regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little information is known about the role of epigenetic modification of MADS-box genes during rice flower development. Here, we report the characterization of a rice gene, curved chimeric palea 1 (CCP1) that functions in palea development. Mutation in CCP1 resulted in abnormal palea with ectopic stigmatic tissues and other pleiotropic phenotypes. We found that OsMADS58, a C-class gene responsible for carpel morphogenesis, was ectopically expressed in the ccp1 palea, indicating that the ccp1 palea was misspecified and partially acquired carpel-like identity. Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development. Map-based cloning revealed that CCP1 encodes a putative plant-specific emBRYONIC flower1 (EMF1)-like protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the level of the H3K27me3 at the OsMADS58 locus was greatly reduced in ccp1 compared with that in the wild-type. Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development.
25647327	Calcium and ZmCCaMK are involved in brassinosteroid-induced antioxidant defense in maize leaves.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) have been shown to enhance stress tolerance by inducing antioxidant defense systems. However, the mechanisms of BR-induced antioxidant defense in plants remain to be determined. In this study, the role of calcium (Ca(2+)) and maize calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK), ZmCCaMK, in BR-induced antioxidant defense, and the relationship between ZmCCaMK and Ca(2+) in BR signaling were investigated. BR treatment led to a significant increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in protoplasts from maize mesophyll, and Ca(2+) was shown to be required for BR-induced antioxidant defense. Treatment with BR induced increases in gene expression and enzyme activity of ZmCCaMK in maize leaves. Transient overexpression and silencing of ZmCCaMK in maize protoplasts demonstrated that ZmCCaMK was required for BR-induced antioxidant defense. The requirement for CCaMK was further investigated using a loss-of-function mutant of OsCCaMK, the orthologous gene of ZmCCaMK in rice. Consistent with the findings in maize, BR treatment could not induce antioxidant defense in the rice OsCCAMK mutant. Furthermore, Ca(2+) was required for BR-induced gene expression and activation of ZmCCaMK, while ZmCCaMK was shown to enhance the BR-induced increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Moreover, our results also showed that ZmCCaMK and H2O2 influenced each other. These results indicate that Ca(2+) works together with ZmCCaMK in BR-induced antioxidant defense, and there are two positive feedback loops between Ca(2+) or H2O2 and ZmCCaMK in BR signaling in maize.
25667114	A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homolog Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Chloroplasts are not generated de novo but proliferate from a pre-existing population of plastids present in meristematic cells. Chloroplast division is executed by the co-ordinated action of at least two molecular machineries: internal machinery located on the stromal side of the inner envelope membrane and external machinery located on the cytosolic side of the outer envelope membrane. To date, molecular studies of chloroplast division in higher plants have been limited to several species such as Arabidopsis. To elucidate chloroplast division in rice, we performed forward genetics and isolated a mutant displaying large chloroplasts among an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Oryza sativa spp japonica Nipponbare population. Using a map-based approach, this mutation, termed giant chloroplast (gic), was allocated in a gene that encodes a protein that is homologous to Paralog of ARC6 (PARC6), which is known to play a role in chloroplast division. GIC is unique in that it has a long C-terminal extension that is not present in other PARC6 homologs. Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage. This report is the first describing a chloroplast division mutant in monocotyledons and its effect on plant development.
25844113	A QTL for root growth angle on rice chromosome 7 is involved in the genetic pathway of DEEPER ROOTING 1.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Root growth angle (RGA) is an important trait that influences the ability of rice to avoid drought stress. DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1), which is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for RGA, is responsible for the difference in RGA between the shallow-rooting cultivar IR64 and the deep-rooting cultivar Kinandang Patong. However, the RGA differences between these cultivars cannot be fully explained by DRO1. The objective of this study was to identify new QTLs for RGA explaining the difference in RGA between these cultivars.

RESULTS: By crossing IR64 (which has a non-functional allele of DRO1) with Kinandang Patong (which has a functional allele of DRO1), we developed 26 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) that carried a particular chromosome segment from Kinandang Patong in the IR64 genetic background. Using these CSSLs, we found only one chromosomal region that was related to RGA: on chromosome 9, which includes DRO1. Using an F2 population derived from a cross between Kinandang Patong and the Dro1-NIL (near isogenic line), which had a functional DRO1 allele in the IR64 genetic background, we identified a new QTL for RGA (DRO3) on the long arm of chromosome 7.

CONCLUSIONS: DRO3 may only affect RGA in plants with a functional DRO1 allele, suggesting that DRO3 is involved in the DRO1 genetic pathway.
25650179	Nd(III)-induced rice mitochondrial dysfunction investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic methods.	2015	J Membr Biol	The production capacity and yield of neodymium (Nd) in China have ranked the first in the world. Because of its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, Nd compounds have entered into the agricultural environment greatly to promote plant growth. Mitochondria play a crucial role in respiration and metabolism during the growth of plants. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Nd act at the mitochondrial level in plant cells. In this study, rice mitochondrial swelling, collapsed transmembrane potential and decreased membrane fluidity were examined to be important factors for mitochondria permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening induced by Nd(III). The protection of cyclosporin A (CsA) and dithiothreitol (DTT) could confirm that Nd(III) could trigger mPTP opening. Additionally, mitochondrial membrane breakdown observed by TEM and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) could also elucidate the mPTP opening from another point of view. At last, the study showed that Nd(III) could restrain the mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxide, so it might interact with anionic lipid too. This detection will be conductive to the safe application of Nd compounds in agriculture and food industry.
25690516	Seed Priming with Selenium: Consequences for Emergence, Seedling Growth, and Biochemical Attributes of Rice.	2015	Biol Trace Elem Res	The present study was undertaken to appraise the role of selenium priming for improving emergence and seedling growth of basmati rice. Seeds of two fine rice cultivars (Super and Shaheen Basmati) were primed with concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 μmol L(-1) selenium. Untreated dry- and hydro-primed seeds were maintained as the control and positive control, respectively. Selenium priming resulted in early commencement of emergence, triggered seedling growth irrespective of rice cultivar over untreated control, and was more effective than hydro-priming except at higher concentrations. Lower electrical conductivity of seed leachates, reduced lipid peroxidation, greater α-amylase activity, higher soluble sugars, and enhanced activities of enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)) were observed in seeds primed with selenium. Rice seedlings derived from selenium-primed seeds exhibited more chlorophyll contents, while total phenolics were comparable with those of the control seedlings. The improved starch metabolism, greater membrane stability, and increased activity of antioxidants were considered as possible mechanisms responsible for such improvements in emergence and seedling vigor of rice mediated by selenium priming. Priming with selenium (15-60 μmol L(-1)) favored rice emergence and seedling growth. Nevertheless, soaking seeds in relatively concentrated (90 and 105 μmol L(-1)) selenium solution had overall detrimental effects.
25850033	Genetic variability and evolutionary diversification of membrane ABC transporters in plants.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette proteins have been recognized as playing a crucial role in the regulation of growth and resistance processes in all kingdoms of life. They have been deeply studied in vertebrates because of their role in drug resistance, but much less is known about ABC superfamily functions in plants.

RESULTS: Recently released plant genome sequences allowed us to identify 803 ABC transporters in four vascular plants (Oryza. sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum and Vitis vinifera) and 76 transporters in the green alga Volvox carteri, by comparing them with those reannotated in Arabidopsis thaliana and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Retrieved proteins have been phylogenetically analysed to infer orthologous relationships. Most orthologous relationships in the A, D, E and F subfamilies were found, and interesting expansions within the ABCG subfamily were observed and discussed. A high level of purifying selection is acting in the five ABC subfamilies A, B, C, D and E. However, evolutionary rates of recent duplicate genes could influence vascular plant genome diversification. The transcription profiles of ABC genes within tomato organs revealed a broad functional role for some transporters and a more specific activity for others, suggesting the presence of key ABC regulators in tomato.

CONCLUSIONS: The findings achieved in this work could contribute to address several biological questions concerning the evolution of the relationship between genomes of different species. Plant ABC protein inventories obtained could be a valuable tool both for basic and applied studies. Indeed, interpolation of the putative role of gene functions can accelerate the discovering of new ABC superfamily members.
25684654	A Gene Expression Profiling of Early Rice Stamen Development that Reveals Inhibition of Photosynthetic Genes by OsMADS58.	2015	Mol Plant	Stamen is a unique plant organ wherein germ cells or microsporocytes that commit to meiosis are initiated from somatic cells during its early developmental process. While genes determining stamen identity are known according to the ABC model of floral development, little information is available on how these genes affect germ cell initiation. By using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array to assess 51 279 transcripts, we established a dynamic gene expression profile (GEP) of the early developmental process of rice (Oryza sativa) stamen. Systematic analysis of the GEP data revealed novel expression patterns of some developmentally important genes including meiosis-, tapetum-, and phytohormone-related genes. Following the finding that a substantial amount of nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic proteins are expressed at the low levels in early rice stamen, through the ChIP-seq analysis we found that a C-class MADS box protein, OsMADS58, binds many nuclear-encoded genes participated in photosystem and light reactions and the expression levels of most of them are increased when expression of OsMADS58 is downregulated in the osmads58 mutant. Furthermore, more pro-chloroplasts are observed and increased signals of reactive oxygen species are detected in the osmads58 mutant anthers. These findings implicate a novel link between stamen identity determination and hypoxia status establishment.
25717036	CO2-responsive CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like, and time of chlorophyll a/b binding protein Expression1 protein is a positive regulator of starch synthesis in vegetative organs of rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	A unique CO2-Responsive CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like, and Time of Chlorophyll a/b Binding Protein1 (CCT) Protein (CRCT) containing a CCT domain but not a zinc finger motif is described, which is up-regulated under elevated CO2 in rice (Oryza sativa). The expression of CRCT showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of the light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Promoter β-glucuronidase analysis showed that CRCT was highly expressed in the phloem of various tissues such as leaf blade and leaf sheath. Overexpression or RNA interference knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression. More importantly, starch content in leaf sheath, which serves as a temporary storage organ for photoassimilates, was markedly increased in overexpression lines and decreased in knockdown lines. The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis, such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and α-glucan phospholylase, were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of CRCT. Given these observations, we suggest that CRCT is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates.
25682587	Cultivar specific variations in antioxidative defense system, genome and proteome of two tropical rice cultivars against ambient and elevated ozone.	2015	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	For the past few decades continuous increase in the levels of tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations is posing to be a threat for agricultural productivity. Two high yielding tropical rice cultivars (Malviya dhan 36 and Shivani) were evaluated against different concentrations of O3 under field conditions. Experimental design included filtered chambers, non-filtered chambers having ambient O3 and 10 and 20ppb elevated O3 above the ambient. Study was conducted to assess differential response if any in induction of antioxidative defense system, genome stability, leaf proteome, yield and quality of the product in both the test cultivars. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) were induced under ambient and elevated levels of O3. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of SOD, CAT and POD also displayed increased enzymatic activity along with associated alterations in specific isoforms. Ascorbic acid, thiols and phenolics were also stimulated at ambient and elevated O3. Structural alterations in DNA of rice plants due to O3 affecting its genome template stability (GTS) was examined using RAPD technique. 2-D PAGE revealed 25 differential spots in Malviya dhan 36 and 36 spots in Shivani after O3 treatment with reductions in RuBisCO subunits. Reductions in yield and change in the quality of grains were also noticed.
25888360	Comparative mapping combined with homology-based cloning of the rice genome reveals candidate genes for grain zinc and iron concentration in maize.	2015	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Grain zinc and iron concentration is a complex trait that is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL) and is important for maintaining body health. Despite the substantial effort that has been put into identifying QTL for grain zinc and iron concentration, the integration of independent QTL is useful for understanding the genetic foundation of traits. The number of QTL for grain zinc and iron concentration is relatively low in a single species. Therefore, combined analysis of different genomes may help overcome this challenge.

RESULTS: As a continuation of our work on maize, meta-analysis of QTL for grain zinc and iron concentration in rice was performed to identify meta-QTL (MQTL). Based on MQTL in rice and maize, comparative mapping combined with homology-based cloning was performed to identify candidate genes for grain zinc and iron concentration in maize. In total, 22 MQTL in rice, 4 syntenic MQTL-related regions, and 3 MQTL-containing candidate genes in maize (ortho-mMQTL) were detected. Two maize orthologs of rice, GRMZM2G366919 and GRMZM2G178190, were characterized as natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) genes and considered to be candidate genes. Phylogenetic analysis of NRAMP genes among maize, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana further demonstrated that they are likely responsible for the natural variation of maize grain zinc and iron concentration.

CONCLUSIONS: Syntenic MQTL-related regions and ortho-mMQTL are prime areas for future investigation as well as for marker-assisted selection breeding programs. Furthermore, the combined method using the rice genome that was used in this study can shed light on other species and help direct future quantitative trait research. In conclusion, these results help elucidate the molecular mechanism that underlies grain zinc and iron concentration in maize.
25730074	Genetic analysis of seed-shattering genes in rice using an F₃:₄ population derived from an Oryza sativa x Oryza rufipogon cross.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Seed shattering of wild plant species is thought to be an adaptive trait to facilitate seed dispersal. For rice breeding, seed shatter-ing is an important trait for improving breeding strategies, particularly when developing lines use interspecific hybrids and introgression of genes from wild species. We developed F₃:₄ recombinant inbred lines from an interspecific cross between Oryza sativa cv. Ilpoombyeo and Oryza rufipogon. In this study, we genetically analyzed known shat-tering-related loci using the F₃:₄ population of O. sativa/O. rufipogon. CACTA-AG190 was significantly associated with the shattering trait CACTA-TD according to bulked segregant analysis results, and was found in the qSH-1 region of chromosome 1. Fine genetic mapping of the flanking regions around qSH-1 based on CACTA-AG190 revealed multiple-sequence variations. The highest limit of detection based on quantitative trait locus analysis was observed between shaap-7715 and a 518-bp insertion site. Two other quantitative trait locus analyses of seed-shattering-related loci, qSH-4 and sh-h, were performed using simple sequence repeat and allele-pecific single nucleotide polymor-phism markers. Our results can be applied for rice-breeding research, such as marker-assisted selection between cultivated and wild rice.
25844112	Pseudo-backcrossing design for rapidly pyramiding multiple traits into a preferential rice variety.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Pyramiding multiple genes into a desirable genetic background can take years to accomplish. In this paper, a pseudo-backcrossing scheme was designed to shorten the backcrossing cycle needed. PinK3, an aromatic and potentially high-yielding rice variety-although one that is intolerant to flash flooding (Sub) and susceptible to bacterial leaf blight (BB), leaf-neck blast (BL) and the brown planthopper (BPH)-was used as a genetic basis for significant improvements through gene pyramiding.

RESULTS: Four resistance donors with five target genes (Sub1A-C, xa5, Xa21, TPS and SSIIa) and three QTLs (qBph3, qBL1 and qBL11) were backcrossed individually using markers into the pseudo-recurrent parent 'PinK3' via one cycle of backcrossing followed by two cycles of pseudo-backcrossing and three selfings with rigorous foreground marker-assisted selection. In total, 29 pseudo-backcross inbred lines (BILs) were developed. Genome composition was surveyed using 61 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 35 of which were located on six carrier chromosomes, with the remainder located on six non-carrier chromosomes. The recurrent genome content (%RGC) and donor genome content (%DGC), which were based on the physical positions of BC1F2, ranged from 69.99 to 88.98% and 11.02 to 30.01%, respectively. For the pseudo-BC3F3BILs, the %RGC and %DGC ranged from 74.50 to 81.30% and 18.70 to 25.50%, respectively. These results indicated that without direct background selection, no further increases in %RGC were obtained during pseudo-backcrossing, whereas rigorous foreground marker-assisted selection tended to reduce linkage drag during pseudo-backcrossing. The evaluation of new traits in selected pseudo-BC3F3BILs indicated significant improvements in resistance to BB, BL, BPH and Sub compared with PinK3, as well as significant improvements in grain yield (21-68%) over the donors, although yield was 7-26% lower than in 'PinK3'. All pyramided lines were aromatic and exhibited improved starch profiles, rendering them suitable for industrial food applications.

CONCLUSIONS: Results show that our new pyramiding platform, which is based on marker-assisted pseudo-backcrossing, can fix five target genes and three QTLs into a high-yielding pseudo-recurrent background within seven breeding cycles in four years. This multiple pseudo-backcrossing platform decreases the time required to generate new rice varieties exhibiting complex, durable resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in backgrounds with desirable qualities.
25687128	Fine mapping of a major quantitative trait locus, qLG-9, that controls seed longevity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We fine-mapped a quantitative trait locus, qLG - 9, for seed longevity detected between Japonica-type and Indica-type cultivars. qLG - 9 was mapped in a 30-kb interval of the Nipponbare genome sequence. A quantitative trait locus, qLG-9, for seed longevity in rice has previously been detected on chromosome 9 by using backcross inbred lines derived from a cross between Japonica-type (Nipponbare) and Indica-type (Kasalath) cultivars. In the present study, the chromosomal location of qLG-9 was precisely determined by fine-scale mapping. Firstly, allelic difference in qLG-9 was verified by QTL analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross between Nipponbare and NKSL-1, in which a segment of Kasalath chromosome 9 was substituted in Nipponbare genetic background. Then, we selected F2 plants in which recombination had occurred near qLG-9 and performed F3 progeny testing on these plants to determine the genotype classes of qLG-9. Eventually, qLG-9 was mapped in a 30-kb interval (defined by two markers, CAPSb and CHPa12) of the Nipponbare genome sequence. This allowed us to nominate positional candidate genes of qLG-9. Additionally, we developed near-isogenic lines (NIL) for qLG-9 by marker-assisted selection. qLG-9 NIL showed significantly higher seed longevity than isogenic control of Nipponbare. These results will facilitate cloning of the gene(s) underlying qLG-9 as well as marker-assisted transfer of desirable genes for seed longevity improvement in rice.
25650828	Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae poses a major threat to rice production worldwide. The utilization of host resistance (R) genes is considered to be the most effective and economic means to control rice blast. Here, we show that the japonica landrace Yangmaogu (YMG) displays a broader spectrum of resistance to blast isolates than other previously reported broad-spectrum resistant (BSR) cultivars. Genetic analysis suggested that YMG contains at least three major R genes. One gene, Pi64, which exhibits resistance to indica-sourced isolate CH43 and several other isolates, was mapped to a 43-kb interval on chromosome 1 of YMG. Two open reading frames (NBS-1 and NBS-2) encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins were short-listed as candidate genes for Pi64. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into three susceptible japonica cultivars. Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene. Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined. Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars.
25680791	Physiological mechanisms contributing to the QTL-combination effects on improved performance of IR64 rice NILs under drought.	2015	J Exp Bot	Characterizing the physiological mechanisms behind major-effect drought-yield quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can provide an understanding of the function of the QTLs-as well as plant responses to drought in general. In this study, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes with QTLs derived from drought-tolerant traditional variety AdaySel that were introgressed into drought-susceptible high-yielding variety IR64, one of the most popular megavarieties in South Asian rainfed lowland systems. Of the different combinations of the four QTLs evaluated, genotypes with two QTLs (qDTY 2.2 + qDTY 4.1 ) showed the greatest degree of improvement under drought compared with IR64 in terms of yield, canopy temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, qDTY 2.2 and qDTY 4.1 showed a potential for complementarity in that they were each most effective under different severities of drought stress. Multiple drought-response mechanisms were observed to be conferred in the genotypes with the two-QTL combination: higher root hydraulic conductivity and in some cases greater root growth at depth. As evidenced by multiple leaf water status and plant growth indicators, these traits affected transpiration but not transpiration efficiency or harvest index. The results from this study highlight the complex interactions among major-effect drought-yield QTLs and the drought-response traits they confer, and the need to evaluate the optimal combinations of QTLs that complement each other when present in a common genetic background.
25755666	Identification and DUS Testing of Rice Varieties through Microsatellite Markers.	2015	Int J Plant Genomics	Identification and registration of new rice varieties are very important to be free from environmental effects and using molecular markers that are more reliable. The objectives of this study were, first, the identification and distinction of 40 rice varieties consisting of local varieties of Iran, improved varieties, and IRRI varieties using PIC, and discriminating power, second, cluster analysis based on Dice similarity coefficient and UPGMA algorithm, and, third, determining the ability of microsatellite markers to separate varieties utilizing the best combination of markers. For this research, 12 microsatellite markers were used. In total, 83 polymorphic alleles (6.91 alleles per locus) were found. In addition, the variation of PIC was calculated from 0.52 to 0.9. The results of cluster analysis showed the complete discrimination of varieties from each other except for IR58025A and IR58025B. Moreover, cluster analysis could detect the most of the improved varieties from local varieties. Based on the best combination of markers analysis, five pair primers together have shown the same results of all markers for detection among all varieties. Considering the results of this research, we can propose that microsatellite markers can be used as a complementary tool for morphological characteristics in DUS tests.
25658309	Are differences in genomic data sets due to true biological variants or errors in genome assembly: an example from two chloroplast genomes.	2015	PLoS One	DNA sequencing has been revolutionized by the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Plummeting costs and the massive throughput capacities of second and third generation sequencing platforms have transformed many fields of biological research. Concurrently, new data processing pipelines made rapid de novo genome assemblies possible. However, high quality data are critically important for all investigations in the genomic era. We used chloroplast genomes of one Oryza species (O. australiensis) to compare differences in sequence quality: one genome (GU592209) was obtained through Illumina sequencing and reference-guided assembly and the other genome (KJ830774) was obtained via target enrichment libraries and shotgun sequencing. Based on the whole genome alignment, GU592209 was more similar to the reference genome (O. sativa: AY522330) with 99.2% sequence identity (SI value) compared with the 98.8% SI values in the KJ830774 genome; whereas the opposite result was obtained when the SI values in coding and noncoding regions of GU592209 and KJ830774 were compared. Additionally, the junctions of two single copies and repeat copies in the chloroplast genome exhibited differences. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using these sequences, and the different data sets yielded dissimilar topologies: phylogenetic replacements of the two individuals were remarkably different based on whole genome sequencing or SNP data and insertions and deletions (indels) data. Thus, we concluded that the genomic composition of GU592209 was heterogeneous in coding and non-coding regions. These findings should impel biologists to carefully consider the quality of sequencing and assembly when working with next-generation data.
25849155	Histone chaperones in Arabidopsis and rice: genome-wide identification, phylogeny, architecture and transcriptional regulation.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Histone chaperones modulate chromatin architecture and hence play a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In contrast to their animal and yeast counterparts, not much is known about plant histone chaperones. To gain insights into their functions in plants, we sought to identify histone chaperones from two model plant species and investigated their phylogeny, domain architecture and transcriptional profiles to establish correlation between their expression patterns and potential role in stress physiology and plant development.

RESULTS: Through comprehensive whole genome analyses of Arabidopsis and rice, we identified twenty-two and twenty-five genes encoding histone chaperones in these plants, respectively. These could be classified into seven different families, namely NAP, CAF1, SPT6, ASF1, HIRA, NASP, and FACT. Phylogenetic analyses of histone chaperones from diverse organisms including representative species from each of the major plant groups, yeast and human indicated functional divergence in NAP and CAF1C in plants. For the largest histone chaperone family, NAP, phylogenetic reconstruction suggested the presence of two distinct groups in plants, possibly with differing histone preferences. Further, to comment upon their physiological roles in plants, we analyzed their expression at different developmental stages, across various plant tissues, and under biotic and abiotic stress conditions using pre-existing microarray and qRT-PCR. We found tight transcriptional regulation of some histone chaperone genes during development in both Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that they may play a role in genetic reprogramming associated with the developmental process. Besides, we found significant differential expression of a few histone chaperones under various biotic and abiotic stresses pointing towards their potential function in stress response.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings shed light onto the possible evolutionary trajectory of plant histone chaperones and present novel prospects about their physiological roles. Considering that the developmental process and stress response require altered expression of a large array of genes, our results suggest that some plant histone chaperones may serve a regulatory role by controlling the expression of genes associated with these vital processes, possibly via modulating chromatin dynamics at the corresponding genetic loci.
25727092	Two thiadiazole compounds promote rice defence against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by suppressing the bacterium's production of extracellular polysaccharides.	2015	Mol Plant Pathol	Thiazole, isothiazole, thiadiazole, and their derivatives are used to control various human, animal and plant diseases. In addition to having direct anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties, these compounds are thought to induce host defences, but the mechanism of defence induction remains poorly understood. This article reports that the thiadiazoles of zinc thiazole and bismerthiazol induce H2 O2 accumulation, up-regulation of defence-related genes, callose deposition and hypersensitive response-like cell death in rice leaves infected with Xanthomonas oryaze pv. oryzae (Xoo) strain ZJ173, but not in non-infected leaves. These defence responses in Xoo-infected leaves were suppressed by the exogenous application of catalase, which reduces H2 O2 accumulation. The application of extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) extracted from strain ZJ173 significantly compromised rice defence against ZJ173 with or without thiadiazole treatment. The EPS-deficient Xoo mutant ∆gumH triggered a stronger defence than its parent strain ZJ173. The thiadiazole treatments reduced EPS production by strain ZJ173, but not by the thiadiazole-resistant strain 2-1-1, which is thiadiazole resistant in vivo, but not in vitro; moreover, enhanced defence was not detected in thiadiazole-treated rice inoculated with 2-1-1. Based on these data, we infer that zinc thiazole and bismerthiazol promote rice defence against Xoo by inhibiting the production of bacterial EPS.
25644466	Expression of cytochrome P450 CYP81A6 in rice: tissue specificity, protein subcellular localization, and response to herbicide application.	2015	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	The cytochrome P450 gene CYP81A6 confers tolerance to bentazon and metsulfuron-methyl, two selective herbicides widely used for weed control in rice and wheat fields. Knockout mutants of CYP81A6 are highly susceptible to both herbicides. The present study aimed to characterize the CYP81A6 expression in rice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses demonstrated that foliar treatment of bentazon (500 mg/L) greatly induced expression of CYP81A6 in both wild-type (Jiazhe B) and its knockout mutant (Jiazhe mB): a 10-fold increase at 9 h before returning to basal levels at 24 h in Jiazhe B, while in the mutant the expression level rose to >20-fold at 12 h and maintained at such high level up to 24 h post exposure. In contrast, metsulfuron-methyl (500 mg/L) treatment did not affect the expression of CYP81A6 in Jiazhe B within 80 h; thereafter the expression peaked at 120 h and returned gradually to basal levels by Day 6. We suggest that a metabolite of metsulfuron-methyl, 1H-2,3-benzothiazin-4-(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide, is likely to be responsible for inducing CYP81A6 expression, rather than the metsulfuron-methyl itself. Use of a promoter-GUS reporter construct (CYP81A6Pro::GUS) demonstrated that CYP81A6 was constitutively expressed throughout the plant, with the highest expression in the upper surfaces of leaves. Subcellular localization studies in rice protoplasts showed that CYP81A6 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations advance our understanding of CYP81A6 expression in rice, particularly its response to the two herbicides.
25730034	Meta-analysis of constitutive QTLs for disease resistance in maize and its synteny conservation in the rice genome.	2015	Genet Mol Res	We collected data regarding 340 disease resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the maize genomic database (MaizeGDB). We constructed an integrated linkage map and analyzed this map by using the BioMercator 2.1 software with IBM2 2008 Neighbors genetic linkage map as a reference. We used a meta-analysis method to identify five "consensus" synthetic resistance QTLs located on maize chromosomes 1, 3, 6, and 10, with map intervals of 5.14, 9.00, 28.50, 1.73, and 33.34 cM, respectively. The gene and marker sequences within the five "consensus" QTLs were downloaded from the MaizeGDB website. We identified eight resistance gene analogs (RGAs), through comparison of these sequences with the resistance genes of other members of Poaceae by using the online BLASTx software. On the basis of comparative mapping between the maize genetic map and the rice physical map, 54 rice and 44 maize resistance genes were projected onto the maize IBM2 2008 Neighbors genetic linkage map by using a synteny conservation approach. Additionally, 15 resistance genes in the "consensus" QTL regions were found in two "consensus" QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 6; these resistance genes included rp3, scmv2, wsm2, RG3, RG16, RG36, RG51, RG53, scmv1, mdm1, RG5, RG8, RG10, RG14, and RG29. Our results provide valuable information for fine-mapping QTL, gene cloning, and molecular breeding for resistance in maize.
25688565	Viral-inducible Argonaute18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice by sequestering a host microRNA.	2015	Elife	Viral pathogens are a major threat to rice production worldwide. Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant AGO1a in ago18 background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice.
25699072	Effect of IAA on in vitro growth and colonization of Nostoc in plant roots.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Nostoc is widely known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and the establishment of symbiotic relationship with a wide range of plants from various taxonomic groups. Several strains of Nostoc produce phytohormones that promote growth of its plant partners. Nostoc OS-1 was therefore selected for study because of the presence of putative ipdC gene that encodes a key enzyme to produce Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The results indicated that both cellular and released IAA was found high with increasing incubation time and reached to a peak value (i.e., 21 pmol mg(-1)ch-a) on the third week as determined by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Also the Nostoc OS-1 strain efficiently colonized the roots and promoted the growth of rice as well as wheat under axenic conditions and induced ipdC gene that suggested the possible involvement of IAA in these phenotypes. To confirm the impact of IAA on root colonization efficiency and plant promoting phenotypes of Nostoc OS-1, an ipdC knockout mutant was generated by homologous recombinant method. The amount of releasing IAA, in vitro growth, root colonization, and plant promoting efficiency of the ipdC knockout mutant was observed significantly lower than wild type strain under axenic conditions. Importantly, these phenotypes were restored to wild-type levels when the ipdC knockout mutant was complemented with wild type ipdC gene. These results together suggested that ipdC and/or synthesized IAA of Nostoc OS-1 is required for its efficient root colonization and plant promoting activity.
25725409	Reduction of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase activity is associated with high temperature-induced chalkiness in rice grains.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Global warming affects both rice (Oryza sativa) yields and grain quality. Rice chalkiness due to high temperature during grain filling would lower the grain quality. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased occurrence of chalkiness under high temperature are not fully understood. Previous research suggested that cytosolic pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (cyPPDK, EC 2.7.9.1) in rice modulates carbon metabolism. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between cyPPDK and high temperature-induced chalkiness. High temperature treatments were applied during the grain filling of two rice cultivars (9311 and TXZ-25) which had different sensitivity of chalkiness to high temperature. Chalkiness was increased significantly under high temperature treatment, especially for TXZ-25. A shortened grain filling duration and a decreased grain weight in both cultivars were caused by high temperature treatment. A reduction in PPDK activities due to high temperature was observed during the middle and late grain filling periods, accompanied by down regulated cyPPDK mRNA and protein levels. The temperature effects on the developmental regulation of PPDK activity were confirmed at transcription, translation and post-translational levels. PPDK activities were insensitive to variation in PPDK levels, suggesting the rapid phosphorylation mechanism of this protein. The two varieties showed similar responses to the high temperature treatment in both PPDK activities and chalkiness. We concluded that high temperature-induced chalkiness was associated with the reduction of PPDK activity.
25688911	The Type III Effector AvrBs2 in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola Suppresses Rice Immunity and Promotes Disease Development.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, is one of the most important bacterial pathogens in rice. However, little is known about the functions of individual type III effectors in virulence and pathogenicity of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Here, we examined the effect of the mutations of 23 putative nontranscription activator-like effector genes on X. oryzae pv. oryzicola virulence. The avrBs2 knock-out mutant was significantly attenuated in virulence to rice. In contrast, the xopAA deletion caused enhanced virulence to a certain rice cultivar. It was also demonstrated that six putative effectors, including XopN, XopX, XopA, XopY, XopF1, and AvrBs2, caused the hypersensitive response on nonhost Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Virulence function of AvrBs2 was further confirmed by transgenic technology. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses including the generation of reactive oxygen species and expression of pathogenesis-related genes were strongly suppressed in the AvrBs2-expressing transgenic rice lines. Although not inhibiting flg22-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, heterologous expression of AvrBs2 greatly promotes disease progression in rice caused by two important bacterial pathogens X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola. Collectively, these results indicate that AvrBs2 is an essential virulence factor that contributes to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola virulence through inhibiting defense responses and promoting bacterial multiplication in monocot rice.
25849162	The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. We previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene Pid2, which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular B-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. However, little is known about Pid2-mediated signaling.

RESULTS: Here we report the functional characterization of the U-box/ARM repeat protein OsPUB15 as one of the PID2-binding proteins. We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction. In vitro biochemical assays indicated that PID2K possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate OsPUB15. We also found that the phosphorylated form of OsPUB15 possessed E3 ligase activity. Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPUB15 was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein OsPUB15 was localized in cytosol. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsPUB15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains. We also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that the E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance.
25844117	Multiple tissue-specific expression of rice seed-shattering gene SH4 regulated by its promoter pSH4.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice seed shattering is an important domestication syndrome encoded by a gene named as SH4. The coding region of SH4 has been well studied regarding its function and roles in evolution. However, its promoter has not been identified, which limited our understanding of the detailed regulatory mechanisms of this gene. It is therefore critical to characterize the promoter and study its expression pattern.

RESULTS: We analyzed the 5' upstream sequences of this gene and identified a ~2.6 kb fragment with typical promoter features, which was designated as pSH4. The promoter contained a number of cis-acting elements related to abscisic acid (ABA) and a CpG island that were characteristics of multiple tissue-specific expression. We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4. Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds.

CONCLUSIONS: The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region. Our findings suggest that SH4 may have additional functions in the growth and development of rice, apart from its major role in seed shattering.
25804805	The enhanced drought tolerance of rice plants under ammonium is related to aquaporin (AQP).	2015	Plant Sci	Previously, we demonstrated that drought resistance in rice seedlings was increased by ammonium (NH4(+)) treatment, but not by nitrate (NO3(-)) treatment, and that the change was associated with root development. To study the effects of different forms of nitrogen on water uptake and root growth under drought conditions, we subjected two rice cultivars (cv. 'Shanyou 63' hybrid indica and cv. 'Yangdao 6' indica, China) to polyethylene glycol-induced drought stress in a glasshouse using hydroponic culture. Under drought conditions, NH4(+) significantly stimulated root growth compared to NO3(-), as indicated by the root length, surface area, volume, and numbers of lateral roots and root tips. Drought stress decreased the root elongation rate in both cultivars when they were supplied with NO3(-), while the rate was unaffected in the presence of NH4(+). Drought stress significantly increased root protoplast water permeability, root hydraulic conductivity, and the expression of root aquaporin (AQP) plasma intrinsic protein (PIP) genes in rice plants supplied with NH4(+); these changes were not observed in plants supplied with NO3(-). Additionally, ethylene, which is involved in the regulation of root growth, accumulated in rice roots supplied with NO3(-) under conditions of drought stress. We conclude that the increase in AQP expression and/or activity enhanced the root water uptake ability and the drought tolerance of rice plants supplied with NH4(+).
25673476	In silico simulation modeling reveals the importance of the Casparian strip for efficient silicon uptake in rice roots.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Silicon (Si) uptake by the roots is mediated by two different transporters, Lsi1 (passive) and Lsi2 (active), in rice (Oryza sativa). Both transporters are polarly localized in the plasma membranes of exodermal (outer) and endodermal (inner) cells with Casparian strips. However, it is unknown how rice is able to take up large amounts of Si compared with other plants, and why rice Si transporters have a characteristic cellular localization pattern. To answer these questions, we simulated Si uptake by rice roots by developing a mathematical model based on a simple diffusion equation that also accounts for active transport by Lsi2. In this model, we calibrated the model parameters using in vivo experimental data on the Si concentrations in the xylem sap and a Monte Carlo method. In our simulation experiments, we compared the Si uptake between roots with various transporter and Casparian strip locations and estimated the Si transport efficiency of roots with different localization patterns and quantities of the Lsi transporters. We found that the Si uptake by roots that lacked Casparian strips was lower than that of normal roots. This suggests that the double-layer structure of the Casparian strips is an important factor in the high Si uptake by rice. We also found that among various possible localization patterns, the most efficient one was that of the wild-type rice; this may explain the high Si uptake capacity of rice.
25844118	Abiotic stress and genome dynamics: specific genes and transposable elements response to iron excess in rice.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Iron toxicity is a root related abiotic stress, occurring frequently in flooded soils. It can affect the yield of rice in lowland production systems. This toxicity is associated with high concentrations of reduced iron (Fe(2+)) in the soil solution. Although the first interface of the element is in the roots, the consequences of an excessive uptake can be observed in several rice tissues. In an original attempt to find both genes and transposable elements involved in the response to an iron toxicity stress, we used a microarray approach to study the transcriptional responses of rice leaves of cv. Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) to iron excess in nutrient solution.

RESULTS: A large number of genes were significantly up- or down-regulated in leaves under the treatment. We analyzed the gene ontology and metabolic pathways of genes involved in the response to this stress and the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) present in the promoter region of up-regulated genes. The majority of genes act in the pathways of lipid metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormones. We also found genes involved in iron acquisition and mobilization, transport of cations and regulatory mechanisms for iron responses, and in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Promoter regions of 27% of genes up-regulated present at least one significant occurrence of an ABA-responsive CRE. Furthermore, and for the first time, we were able to show that iron stress triggers the up-regulation of many LTR-retrotransposons. We have established a complete inventory of transposable elements transcriptionally activated under iron excess and the CREs which are present in their LTRs.

CONCLUSION: The short-term response of Nipponbare seedlings to iron excess, includes activation of genes involved in iron homeostasis, in particular transporters, transcription factors and ROS detoxification in the leaves, but also many transposable elements. Our data led to the identification of CREs which are associated with both genes and LTR-retrotransposons up-regulated under iron excess. Our results strengthen the idea that LTR-retrotransposons participate in the transcriptional response to stress and could thus confer an adaptive advantage for the plant.
25462966	Ethylene is not involved in adaptive responses to flooding in the Amazonian wild rice species Oryza grandiglumis.	2015	J Plant Physiol	The Amazonian wild rice Oryza grandiglumis has two contrasting adaptation mechanisms to flooding submergence: a quiescence response to complete submergence at the seedling stage and an escape response based on internodal elongation to partial submergence at the mature stage. We investigated possible factors that trigger these responses. In stem segments excised from mature O. grandiglumis plants, complete submergence only slightly promoted internodal elongation with increased ethylene levels in the internodes, while partial submergence substantially promoted internodal elongation without increased ethylene levels in the internodes. Incubation of non-submerged stem segments under a continuous flow of humidified ethylene-free air promoted internodal elongation to the same extent as that observed for partially submerged segments. Applied ethylene had little effect on the internodal elongation of non-submerged segments irrespective of humidity conditions. These results indicate that the enhanced internodal elongation of submerged O. grandiglumis plants is not triggered by ethylene accumulated during submergence but by the moist surroundings provided by submergence. The growth of shoots in O. grandiglumis seedlings was not promoted by ethylene or complete submergence, as is the case in O. sativa cultivars possessing the submergence-tolerant gene SUB1A. However, because the genome of O. grandiglumis lacks the SUB1A gene, the quiescence response of O. grandiglumis seedlings to complete submergence may be regulated by a mechanism distinct from that involved in the response of submergence-tolerant O. sativa cultivars.
25765300	Comprehensive analysis of CCCH-type zinc finger family genes facilitates functional gene discovery and reflects recent allopolyploidization event in tetraploid switchgrass.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: In recent years, dozens of Arabidopsis and rice CCCH-type zinc finger genes have been functionally studied, many of which confer important traits, such as abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, delayed leaf senescence and improved plant architecture. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is an important bioenergy crop. Identification of agronomically important genes and/or loci is an important step for switchgrass molecular breeding. Annotating switchgrass CCCH genes using translational genomics methods will help further the goal of understanding switchgrass genetics and creating improved varieties.

RESULTS: Taking advantage of the publicly-available switchgrass genomic and transcriptomic databases, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of switchgrass CCCH genes (PvC3Hs). A total of 103 PvC3Hs were identified and divided into 21 clades according to phylogenetic analysis. Genes in the same clade shared similar gene structure and conserved motifs. Chromosomal location analysis showed that most of the duplicated PvC3H gene pairs are in homeologous chromosomes. Evolution analysis of 19 selected PvC3H pairs showed that 42.1% of them were under diversifying selection. Expression atlas of the 103 PvC3Hs in 21 different organs, tissues and developmental stages revealed genes with higher expression levels in lignified cells, vascular cells, or reproductive tissues/organs, suggesting the potential function of these genes in development. We also found that eight PvC3Hs in Clade-XIV were orthologous to ABA- or stress- responsive CCCH genes in Arabidopsis and rice with functions annotated. Promoter and qRT-PCR analyses of Clade-XIV PvC3Hs showed that these eight genes were all responsive to ABA and various stresses.

CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide analysis of PvC3Hs confirmed the recent allopolyploidization event of tetraploid switchgrass from two closely-related diploid progenitors. The short time window after the polyploidization event allowed the existence of a large number of PvC3H genes with a high positive selection pressure onto them. The homeologous pairs of PvC3Hs may contribute to the heterosis of switchgrass and its wide adaptation in different ecological niches. Phylogenetic and gene expression analyses provide informative clues for discovering PvC3H genes in some functional categories. Particularly, eight PvC3Hs in Clade-XIV were found involved in stress responses. This information provides a foundation for functional studies of these genes in the future.
25741357	Recent advances in the dissection of drought-stress regulatory networks and strategies for development of drought-tolerant transgenic rice plants.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Advances have been made in the development of drought-tolerant transgenic plants, including cereals. Rice, one of the most important cereals, is considered to be a critical target for improving drought tolerance, as present-day rice cultivation requires large quantities of water and as drought-tolerant rice plants should be able to grow in small amounts of water. Numerous transgenic rice plants showing enhanced drought tolerance have been developed to date. Such genetically engineered plants have generally been developed using genes encoding proteins that control drought regulatory networks. These proteins include transcription factors, protein kinases, receptor-like kinases, enzymes related to osmoprotectant or plant hormone synthesis, and other regulatory or functional proteins. Of the drought-tolerant transgenic rice plants described in this review, approximately one-third show decreased plant height under non-stressed conditions or in response to abscisic acid treatment. In cereal crops, plant height is a very important agronomic trait directly affecting yield, although the improvement of lodging resistance should also be taken into consideration. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of plant growth reduction under drought stress conditions holds promise for developing transgenic plants that produce high yields under drought stress conditions. Plant growth rates are reduced more rapidly than photosynthetic activity under drought conditions, implying that plants actively reduce growth in response to drought stress. In this review, we summarize studies on molecular regulatory networks involved in response to drought stress. In a separate section, we highlight progress in the development of transgenic drought-tolerant rice plants, with special attention paid to field trial investigations.
25700981	Transformation of rice with large maize genomic DNA fragments containing high content repetitive sequences.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Large and complex maize BIBAC inserts, even with a length of about 164 kb and repeat sequences of 88.1%, were transferred into rice. The BIBAC vector has been established to clone large DNA fragments and directly transfer them into plants. Previously, we have constructed a maize B73 BIBAC library and demonstrated that the BIBAC clones were stable in Agrobacterium. In this study, we demonstrated that the maize BIBAC clones could be used for rice genetic transformation through Agrobacterium-mediated method, although the average transformation efficiency for the BIBAC clones (0.86%) is much lower than that for generally used binary vectors containing small DNA fragments (15.24%). The 164-kb B73 genomic DNA insert of the BIBAC clone B2-6 containing five maize gene models and 88.1% of repetitive sequences was transferred into rice. In 18.75% (3/16) of the T1, 13.79% (4/29) of the T2, and 5.26% (1/19) of the T3 generation transgenic rice plants positive for the GUS and HYG marker genes, all the five maize genes can be detected. To our knowledge, this is the largest and highest content of repeat sequence-containing DNA fragment that was successfully transferred into plants. Gene expression analysis (RT-PCR) showed that the expression of three out of five genes could be detected in the leaves of the transgenic rice plants. Our study showed a potential to massively use maize genome resource for rice breeding by mass transformation of rice with large maize genomic DNA fragment BIBAC clones.
25689273	Genomic selection and association mapping in rice (Oryza sativa): effect of trait genetic architecture, training population composition, marker number and statistical model on accuracy of rice genomic selection in elite, tropical rice breeding lines.	2015	PLoS Genet	Genomic Selection (GS) is a new breeding method in which genome-wide markers are used to predict the breeding value of individuals in a breeding population. GS has been shown to improve breeding efficiency in dairy cattle and several crop plant species, and here we evaluate for the first time its efficacy for breeding inbred lines of rice. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in conjunction with five-fold GS cross-validation on a population of 363 elite breeding lines from the International Rice Research Institute's (IRRI) irrigated rice breeding program and herein report the GS results. The population was genotyped with 73,147 markers using genotyping-by-sequencing. The training population, statistical method used to build the GS model, number of markers, and trait were varied to determine their effect on prediction accuracy. For all three traits, genomic prediction models outperformed prediction based on pedigree records alone. Prediction accuracies ranged from 0.31 and 0.34 for grain yield and plant height to 0.63 for flowering time. Analyses using subsets of the full marker set suggest that using one marker every 0.2 cM is sufficient for genomic selection in this collection of rice breeding materials. RR-BLUP was the best performing statistical method for grain yield where no large effect QTL were detected by GWAS, while for flowering time, where a single very large effect QTL was detected, the non-GS multiple linear regression method outperformed GS models. For plant height, in which four mid-sized QTL were identified by GWAS, random forest produced the most consistently accurate GS models. Our results suggest that GS, informed by GWAS interpretations of genetic architecture and population structure, could become an effective tool for increasing the efficiency of rice breeding as the costs of genotyping continue to decline.
25447356	Understanding the shoot apical meristem regulation: a study of the phytohormones, auxin and cytokinin, in rice.	2015	Mech Dev	Auxin and cytokinin regulate different critical processes involved in plant growth and environmental feedbacks. These plant hormones act either synergistically or antagonistically to control the organisation, formation and maintenance of meristem. Meristem cells can be divided to generate new tissues and organs at the locations of plant postembryonic development. The aboveground plant organs are created by the shoot apical meristem (SAM). It has been proposed that the phytohormone, cytokinin, plays a positive role in the shoot meristem function, promotes cell expansion and promotes an increasing size of the meristem in Arabidopsis, whereas it has the reverse effects in the root apical meristem (RAM). Over the last few decades, it has been believed that the apically derived auxin suppresses the shoot branching by inactivating the axillary buds. However, it has recently become clear that the mechanism of action of auxinis indirect and multifaceted. In higher plants, the regulatory mechanisms of the SAM formation and organ separation are mostly unknown. This study reviews the effects and functions of cytokinin and auxin at the shoot apical meristem. This study also highlights the merger of the transcription factor activity with the actions of cytokinin/auxin and their complex interactions with the shoot meristem in rice.
25705117	Development and GBS-genotyping of introgression lines (ILs) using two wild species of rice, <i>O. meridionalis</i> and <i>O. rufipogon,</i> in a common recurrent parent, <i>O.</i> <i>sativa</i> cv. Curinga.	None	Mol Breed	Two populations of interspecific introgression lines (ILs) in a common recurrent parent were developed for use in pre-breeding and QTL mapping. The ILs were derived from crosses between cv Curinga, a tropical japonica upland cultivar, and two different wild donors, Oryza meridionalis Ng. accession (W2112) and Oryza rufipogon Griff. accession (IRGC 105491). The lines were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and SSRs. The 32 Curinga/O. meridionalis ILs contain 76.73 % of the donor genome in individual introgressed segments, and each line has an average of 94.9 % recurrent parent genome. The 48 Curinga/O. rufipogon ILs collectively contain 97.6 % of the donor genome with an average of 89.9 % recurrent parent genome per line. To confirm that these populations were segregating for traits of interest, they were phenotyped for pericarp color in the greenhouse and for four agronomic traits-days to flowering, plant height, number of tillers, and number of panicles-in an upland field environment. Seeds from these IL libraries and the accompanying GBS datasets are publicly available and represent valuable genetic resources for exploring the genetics and breeding potential of rice wild relatives.
25710173	Effects of exogenous gibberellic acid3 on iron and manganese plaque amounts and iron and manganese uptake in rice.	2015	PLoS One	Gibberellins (GA) regulate various components of plant development. Iron and Mn plaque result from oxiding and hydroxiding Fe and Mn, respectively, on the roots of aquatic plant species such as rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we found that exogenous gibberellic acid3 (GA3) spray decreased Fe plaque, but increased Mn plaque, with applications of Kimura B nutrient solution. Similar effects from GA3, leading to reduced Fe plaque and increased Mn plaque, were also found by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometric microanalysis. Reduced Fe plaque was observed after applying GA3 to the groups containing added Fe2+ (17 and 42 mg•L(-1)) and an increasing trend was detected in Mn plaques of the Mn2+ (34 and 84 mg•L(-1)) added treatments. In contrast, an inhibitor of GA3, uniconazole, reversed the effects of GA3. The uptake of Fe or Mn in rice plants was enhanced after GA3 application and Fe or Mn plaque production. Strong synergetic effects of GA3 application on Fe plaque production were detected. However, no synergetic effects on Mn plaque production were detected.
25667113	Base to Tip and Long-Distance Transport of Sodium in the Root of Common Reed [Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.] at Steady State Under Constant High-Salt Conditions.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	We analyzed the directions and rates of translocation of sodium ions (Na(+)) within tissues of a salt-tolerant plant, common reed [Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.], and a salt-sensitive plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.), under constant high-salt conditions using radioactive (22)Na tracer and a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS). First, the test plants were incubated in a nutrient solution containing 50 mM NaCl and a trace level of (22)Na for 24 h (feeding step). Then the original solution was replaced with a fresh solution containing 50 mM NaCl but no (22)Na, in which the test plants remained for >48 h (chase step). Non-invasive dynamic visualization of (22)Na distribution in the test plants was conducted during feeding and chase steps with PETIS. Our results revealed that (22)Na was absorbed in the roots of common reed, but not transported to the upper shoot beyond the shoot base. During the chase step, a basal to distal movement of (22)Na was detected within the root tissue over >5 cm with a velocity of approximately 0.5 cm h(-1). On the other hand, (22)Na that was absorbed in the roots of rice was continuously translocated to and accumulated in the whole shoot. We concluded that the basal roots and the shoot base of common reed have constitutive functions of Na(+) exclusion only in the direction of root tips, even under constant high-salt conditions. This function apparently may contribute to the low Na(+) concentration in the upper shoot and high salt tolerance of common reed.
25300838	Rice, indica (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Methods Mol Biol	Indica varieties, which are generally recalcitrant to tissue culture and transformation, occupy 80 % of rice cultivation area in the world. Therefore, transformation method for indica rice must be improved greatly so that global rice production would take full advantage of cutting-edge biotechnology. An efficient protocol for indica transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is hereby described. Immature embryos collected from plants in a greenhouse are cocultivated with A. tumefaciens after pretreatment with heat and centrifuging. The protocol was successfully tested in many elite indica cultivars such as IR8, IR24, IR58025B, IR64, IR72, Suweon 258, and Nanjing 11, yielding between 5 and 15 of independent transgenic plants per immature embryo. The use of immature embryos is recommended because gene transfer to them could be much more efficient and much less genotype dependent than gene transfer to callus.
25585673	AEF1/MPR25 is implicated in RNA editing of plastid atpF and mitochondrial nad5, and also promotes atpF splicing in Arabidopsis and rice.	2015	Plant J	RNA editing is an essential mechanism that modifies target cytidines to uridine in both mitochondrial and plastid mRNA. Target sites are recognized by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Using bioinformatics predictions based on the code describing sequence recognition by PPR proteins, we have identified an Arabidopsis editing factor required for editing of atpF in plastids. A loss-of-function mutation in ATPF EDITING FACTOR 1 (AEF1, AT3G22150) results in severe variegation, presumably due to decreased plastid ATP synthase levels. Loss of editing at the atpF site is coupled with a large decrease in splicing of the atpF transcript, even though the editing site is within an exon and 53 nucleotides distant from the splice site. The rice orthologue of AEF1, MPR25, has been reported to be required for editing of a site in mitochondrial nad5 transcripts, and we confirm that editing of the same site is affected in the Arabidopsis aef1 mutant. We also show that splicing of chloroplast atpF transcripts is affected in the rice mpr25 mutant. AEF1 is thus highly unusual for an RNA editing specificity factor in that it has functions in both organelles.
25586315	Engineering temporal accumulation of a low recalcitrance polysaccharide leads to increased C6 sugar content in plant cell walls.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Reduced cell wall recalcitrance and increased C6 monosaccharide content are desirable traits for future biofuel crops, as long as these biomass modifications do not significantly alter normal growth and development. Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG), a cell wall polysaccharide only present in grasses and related species among flowering plants, is comprised of glucose monomers linked by both β-1,3 and β-1,4 bonds. Previous data have shown that constitutive production of MLG in barley (Hordeum vulgare) severely compromises growth and development. Here, we used spatio-temporal strategies to engineer Arabidopsis thaliana plants to accumulate significant amounts of MLG in the cell wall by expressing the rice CslF6 MLG synthase using secondary cell wall and senescence-associated promoters. Results using secondary wall promoters were suboptimal. When the rice MLG synthase was expressed under the control of a senescence-associated promoter, we obtained up to four times more glucose in the matrix cell wall fraction and up to a 42% increase in saccharification compared to control lines. Importantly, these plants grew and developed normally. The induction of MLG deposition at senescence correlated with an increase of gluconic acid in cell wall extracts of transgenic plants in contrast to the other approaches presented in this study. MLG produced in Arabidopsis has an altered structure compared to the grass glucan, which likely affects its solubility, while its molecular size is unaffected. The induction of cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis in senescing tissues offers a novel engineering alternative to enhance cell wall properties of lignocellulosic biofuel crops.
25480005	Phosphate transporter OsPht1;8 in rice plays an important role in phosphorus redistribution from source to sink organs and allocation between embryo and endosperm of seeds.	2015	Plant Sci	Phosphorus (P) redistribution from source to sink organs within plant is required for optimizing growth and development under P deficient condition. In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice. In comparison to wild type (WT) and EnSRi lines, SSRi lines under P deficient condition accumulated more P in old blades and less P in young blades, corresponding to attenuated and enriched transcripts of P-responsive genes in old and young blades, respectively. The ratio of total P in young blades to that in old blades decreased from 2.6 for WT to 0.9-1.2 for SSRi lines. During the grain-filling stage, relative to WT, SSRi lines showed the substantial decrease of total P content in both endosperm and embryo, while EnSRi lines showed 40-50% decrease of total P content in embryo but similar P content in endosperm. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsPT8 plays a critical role in redistribution of P from source to sink organs and P homeostasis in seeds of rice.
25586098	Golgi/plastid-type manganese superoxide dismutase involved in heat-stress tolerance during grain filling of rice.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is widely assumed to play a role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species caused by environmental stresses. We found a characteristic expression of manganese SOD 1 (MSD1) in a heat-stress-tolerant cultivar of rice (Oryza sativa). The deduced amino acid sequence contains a signal sequence and an N-glycosylation site. Confocal imaging analysis of rice and onion cells transiently expressing MSD1-YFP showed MSD1-YFP in the Golgi apparatus and plastids, indicating that MSD1 is a unique Golgi/plastid-type SOD. To evaluate the involvement of MSD1 in heat-stress tolerance, we generated transgenic rice plants with either constitutive high expression or suppression of MSD1. The grain quality of rice with constitutive high expression of MSD1 grown at 33/28 °C, 12/12 h, was significantly better than that of the wild type. In contrast, MSD1-knock-down rice was markedly susceptible to heat stress. Quantitative shotgun proteomic analysis indicated that the overexpression of MSD1 up-regulated reactive oxygen scavenging, chaperone and quality control systems in rice grains under heat stress. We propose that the Golgi/plastid MSD1 plays an important role in adaptation to heat stress.
25480003	Scorpion peptide LqhIT2 activates phenylpropanoid pathways via jasmonate to increase rice resistance to rice leafrollers.	2015	Plant Sci	LqhIT2 is an insect-specific toxin peptide identified in Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus that can be toxic to lepidoptera pests. However, whether LqhIT2 induces insect resistance in rice, and how the LqhIT2 influences the biochemical metabolism of rice plants remains unknown. Here, purified LqhIT2-GST fusion protein had toxicity to rice leafrollers. Meanwhile, in vitro and field trials showed that LqhIT2 transgenic rice plants were less damaged by rice leafrollers compared to the wild type plants. Introducing LqhIT2 primed the elevated expression of lipoxygenase, a key component of the jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathway, together with enhanced linolenic acid, cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonic acid-isoleucine levels. In addition, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key gene of the phenylpropanoid pathway, was up-regulated. Correspondingly, the contents of downstream products of the phenylpropanoid pathway such as flavonoids and lignins, were also increased in LqhIT2 transgenic plants. These changes were paralleled by decreased starch, glucose, and glucose-6-phosphate accumulation, the key metabolites of glycolysis pathway that supplies the raw material and intermediate carbon products for phenylpropanoids biosyntheses. These findings suggest that, in addition to its own toxicity against pests, LqhIT2 activate the phenylpropanoid pathway via jasmonate-mediated priming, which subsequently increases flavonoid and lignin content and improves insect resistance in rice.
25581614	Antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic α-helical octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase of rice.	2015	Biopolymers	AmyI-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase (AmyI-1) of rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica), is a novel cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. The antimicrobial activity of AmyI-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using a chemiluminescence method that measures ATP derived from viable cells. Of the ten kinds of human pathogens, AmyI-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against nine. Its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ICs50 ) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 μM, respectively. AmyI-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 μM, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 μM. The degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from P. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of AmyI-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of P. aeruginosa, S. mutans, and C. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (PI), a DNA-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when AmyI-1-18 was added at a concentration equal to its 4×IC50 . Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of AmyI-1-18 against P. aeruginosa and S. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. In contrast, its antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis and C. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. Collectively, these results indicate that AmyI-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent AMP against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.
25567127	Consumption of Bt rice pollen containing Cry1C or Cry2A does not pose a risk to Propylea japonica (Thunberg) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).	2015	Sci Rep	As a pollen feeder, Propylea japonica would be directly exposed to Cry proteins in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-transgenic rice fields. The effect of Cry1C- or Cry2A-containing transgenic rice pollen on the fitness of P. japonica was assessed using two dietary-exposure experiments in the laboratory. In the first experiment, larval developmental time of P. japonica was significantly longer when fed pollen from Bt rice lines rather than control pollen but other life table parameters were not significantly affected. In the second experiment, P. japonica was not affected when fed a rapeseed pollen-based diet containing purified Cry1C or Cry2A at concentrations that were >10-times higher than in pollen, but P. japonica was affected when the diet contained E-64 as a positive control. In both experiments, the stability and bioactivity of the Cry proteins in the food sources and the uptake of the proteins by P. japonica were confirmed. The results show that P. japonica is not sensitive to Cry1C or Cry2A proteins; the effect observed in the first experiment was likely attributable to unknown differences in the nutritional composition of Bt rice pollen. Overall, the data indicate that the growing of Cry1C- or Cry2A-transgenic rice should pose a negligible risk to P. japonica.
25461700	Identification and expression analysis of rice histone genes.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Histones, acting as the core of nucleosome, are the chief protein component of chromatin. They play an important role in gene regulation by covalent modification at several sites and histone variants replacement. Five major families of histones exist: H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The protein sequences within each family appear to be highly conserved. In this paper, we identified 60 histone proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) including 14 H2A, 15 H2B, 16 H3, 11 H4 and 4 H1. Sequence analysis indicates that histone protein sequences in plant are more variable than in animal. Interestingly, we found a rice-specific H4 variant which showed several amino acid substitutions with canonical protein and was expressed in different tissues in a low level. Expression analysis indicates that a subset of histone genes were expressed in a similar pattern and many of them responded to stress conditions. Specifically, we found that two H2A.Z genes were down-regulated by stress in leaves but not in roots suggesting that they might be involved in stress response.
25559339	An N-terminal region of a Myb-like protein is involved in its intracellular localization and activation of a gibberellin-inducible proteinase gene in germinated rice seeds.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The expression of the gene for a proteinase (Rep1) is upregulated by gibberellins. The CAACTC regulatory element (CARE) of the Rep1 promoter is involved in the gibberellin response. We isolated a cDNA for a CARE-binding protein containing a Myb domain in its carboxyl-terminal region and designated the gene Carboxyl-terminal Myb1 (CTMyb1). This gene encodes two polypeptides of two distinctive lengths, CTMyb1L and CTMyb1S, which include or exclude 213 N-terminal amino acid residues, respectively. CTMyb1S transactivated the Rep1 promoter in the presence of OsGAMyb, but not CTMyb1L. We observed an interaction between CTMyb1S and the rice prolamin box-binding factor (RPBF). A bimolecular fluorescence complex analysis detected the CTMyb1S and RPBF complex in the nucleus, but not the CTMyb1L and RPBF complex. The results suggest that the arrangement of the transfactors is involved in gibberellin-inducible expression of Rep1.
25599829	Creation of fragrant rice by targeted knockout of the OsBADH2 gene using TALEN technology.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Fragrant rice is favoured worldwide because of its agreeable scent. The presence of a defective badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) results in the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), which is a major fragrance compound. Here, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to target and disrupt the OsBADH2 gene. Six heterozygous mutants (30%) were recovered from 20 transgenic hygromycin-resistant lines. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these lines had various indel mutations at the TALEN target site. All six transmitted the BADH2 mutations to the T1 generation; and four T1 mutant lines tested also efficiently transmitted the mutations to the T2 generation. Mutant plants carrying only the desired DNA sequence change but not the TALEN transgene were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. The 2AP content of rice grains of the T1 lines with homozygous mutations increased from 0 to 0.35-0.75 mg/kg, which was similar to the content of a positive control variety harbouring the badh2-E7 mutation. We also simultaneously introduced three different pairs of TALENs targeting three separate rice genes into rice cells by bombardment and obtained lines with mutations in one, two and all three genes. These results indicate that targeted mutagenesis using TALENs is a useful approach to creating important agronomic traits.
25619895	Light-modulated seminal wavy roots in rice mediated by nitric oxide-dependent signaling.	2015	Protoplasma	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seminal roots from germinated seeds help establish seedlings, but the seminal root growth and morphology are sensitive to environmental factors. Our previous research showed that several indica-type rice varieties such as Taichung native 1 (TCN1) showed light-induced wavy roots. Also, auxin and oxylipins are two signaling factors regulating the wavy root photomorphology. To investigate the signaling pathway, here, we found that nitric oxide (NO) was a second messenger triggering the signal transduction of light stimuli to induce the wavy morphology of seminal roots in rice. Moreover, interactions between oxylipins and phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin participating in the NO-dependent regulatory pathway of light-induced wavy roots were examined. The order of action of signaling components in the pathway was NO, oxylipins, ethylene, and auxin.
25624395	The WRKY45-2 WRKY13 WRKY42 transcriptional regulatory cascade is required for rice resistance to fungal pathogen.	2015	Plant Physiol	Blast caused by fungal Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide, and this fungus also infects barley (Hordeum vulgare). At least 11 rice WRKY transcription factors have been reported to regulate rice response to M. oryzae either positively or negatively. However, the relationships of these WRKYs in the rice defense signaling pathway against M. oryzae are unknown. Previous studies have revealed that rice WRKY13 (as a transcriptional repressor) and WRKY45-2 enhance resistance to M. oryzae. Here, we show that rice WRKY42, functioning as a transcriptional repressor, suppresses resistance to M. oryzae. WRKY42-RNA interference (RNAi) and WRKY42-overexpressing (oe) plants showed increased resistance and susceptibility to M. oryzae, accompanied by increased or reduced jasmonic acid (JA) content, respectively, compared with wild-type plants. JA pretreatment enhanced the resistance of WRKY42-oe plants to M. oryzae. WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY42. WRKY45-2, functioning as a transcriptional activator, directly activated WRKY13. In addition, WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY45-2 by feedback regulation. The WRKY13-RNAi WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe WRKY42-oe double transgenic lines showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae compared with WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe plants, respectively. These results suggest that the three WRKYs form a sequential transcriptional regulatory cascade. WRKY42 may negatively regulate rice response to M. oryzae by suppressing JA signaling-related genes, and WRKY45-2 transcriptionally activates WRKY13, whose encoding protein in turn transcriptionally suppresses WRKY42 to regulate rice resistance to M. oryzae.
25605006	Proteins interacting with mitochondrial ATP-dependent Lon protease (MAP1) in Magnaporthe oryzae are involved in rice blast disease.	2015	Mol Plant Pathol	The ATP-dependent Lon protease is involved in many physiological processes. In bacteria, Lon regulates pathogenesis and, in yeast, Lon protects mitochondia from oxidative damage. However, little is known about Lon in fungal phytopathogens. MAP1, a homologue of Lon in Magnaporthe oryzae, was recently identified to be important for stress resistance and pathogenesis. Here, we focus on a novel pathogenic pathway mediated by MAP1. Based on an interaction system between rice and a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged MAP1 complementation strain, we identified 23 novel fungal proteins from infected leaves using a TAP approach with mass spectrometry, and confirmed that 14 of these proteins physically interact with MAP1 in vivo. Among these 14 proteins, 11 candidates, presumably localized to the mitochondria, were biochemically determined to be substrates of MAP1 hydrolysis. Deletion mutants were created and functionally analysed to further confirm the involvement of these proteins in pathogenesis. The results indicated that all mutants showed reduced conidiation and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Appressorial formations were not affected, although conidia from certain mutants were morphologically altered. In addition, virulence was reduced in four mutants, enhanced (with lesions forming earlier) in two mutants and remained unchanged in one mutant. Together with the known virulence-related proteins alternative oxidase and enoyl-CoA hydratase, we propose that most of the Lon-interacting proteins are involved in the pathogenic regulation pathway mediated by MAP1 in M. oryzae. Perturbation of this pathway may represent an effective approach for the inhibition of rice blast disease.
25614066	Does morphological and anatomical plasticity during the vegetative stage make wheat more tolerant of water deficit stress than rice?	2015	Plant Physiol	Water scarcity and the increasing severity of water deficit stress are major challenges to sustaining irrigated rice (Oryza sativa) production. Despite the technologies developed to reduce the water requirement, rice growth is seriously constrained under water deficit stress compared with other dryland cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum). We exposed rice cultivars with contrasting responses to water deficit stress and wheat cultivars well adapted to water-limited conditions to the same moisture stress during vegetative growth to unravel the whole-plant (shoot and root morphology) and organ/tissue (root anatomy) responses. Wheat cultivars followed a water-conserving strategy by reducing specific leaf area and developing thicker roots and moderate tillering. In contrast, rice 'IR64' and 'Apo' adopted a rapid water acquisition strategy through thinner roots under water deficit stress. Root diameter, stele and xylem diameter, and xylem number were more responsive and varied with different positions along the nodal root under water deficit stress in wheat, whereas they were relatively conserved in rice cultivars. Increased metaxylem diameter and lower metaxylem number near the root tips and exactly the opposite phenomena at the root-shoot junction facilitated the efficient use of available soil moisture in wheat. Tolerant rice 'Nagina 22' had an advantage in root morphological and anatomical attributes over cultivars IR64 and Apo but lacked plasticity, unlike wheat cultivars exposed to water deficit stress. The key traits determining the adaptation of wheat to dryland conditions have been summarized and discussed.
25642300	Transcriptome-based analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in the rice response to Xanthomonas oryzae infection.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades, with each cascade consisting of a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK), play important roles in dicot plant responses to pathogen infection. However, no single MAP kinase cascade has been identified in rice, and the functions of MAP kinase cascades in rice - pathogen interactions are unknown.

RESULTS: To explore the contribution of MAP kinase cascade in rice in response to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the devastating diseases of rice worldwide, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of rice MAP kinase cascade genes. We transcriptionally analyzed all the 74 MAPKKK genes, 8 MAPKK, and 17 MAPK genes in two pairs of susceptible and resistant rice lines, with each pair having the same genetic background, to determine the rice response to Xoo infection. The expression of a large number of MAP kinase cascade genes changed in response to infection, and some of the genes also showed different expression in resistant and susceptible reactions. In addition, some MAPKKK genes co-expressed with MAPKK and/or MAPK genes, and MAPKK genes co-expressed with MAPK genes.

CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a new perspective regarding the putative roles of rice MAP kinase gene candicates and potential cascade targets for further characterization in rice-pathogen interactions.
25653654	Expression and functional analysis of the plant-specific histone deacetylase HDT701 in rice.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Reversible histone acetylation and deacetylation at the N-terminus of histone tails play a crucial role in regulating eukaryotic gene activity. Acetylation of core histones is associated with gene activation, whereas deacetylation of histone is often correlated with gene repression. The level of histone acetylation is antagonistically catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases citation(HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this work, we examined the subcellular localization, expression pattern and function of HDT701, a member of the plant-specific HD2-type histone deacetylase in rice. HDT701 is localized at the subcellular level in the nucleus. Histochemical GUS-staining analysis revealed that HDT701 is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle of rice. Overexpression of HDT701 in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination. Delayed seed germination of HDT701 overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, overexpression of HDT701 in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage. Taken together, our findings suggested that HDT701 may play an important role in regulating seed germination in response to abiotic stresses in rice.
25636202	A maize phytochrome-interacting factor 3 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3) activates light-responsive transcriptional network genes in coordination with the circadian clock and plant hormones to modulate plant growth and development. However, little is known of the roles PIF3 plays in the responses to abiotic stresses. In this study, the cloning and functional characterization of the ZmPIF3 gene encoding a maize PIF3 protein is reported. Subcellular localization revealed the presence of ZmPIF3 in the cell nucleus. Expression patterns revealed that ZmPIF3 is expressed strongly in leaves. This expression responds to polyethylene glycol, NaCl stress, and abscisic acid application, but not to cold stress. ZmPIF3 under the control of the ubiquitin promoter was introduced into rice. No difference in growth and development between ZmPIF3 transgenic and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions. However, ZmPIF3 transgenic plants were more tolerant to dehydration and salt stresses. ZmPIF3 transgenic plants had increased relative water content, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence, as well as significantly enhanced cell membrane stability under stress conditions. The over-expression of ZmPIF3 increased the expression of stress-responsive genes, such as Rab16D, DREB2A, OSE2, PP2C, Rab21, BZ8 and P5CS, as detected by real-time PCR analysis. Taken together, these results improve our understanding of the role ZmPIF3 plays in abiotic stresses signaling pathways; our findings also indicate that ZmPIF3 regulates the plant response to drought and salt stresses.
25605284	Phytohormone-mediated interkingdom signaling shapes the outcome of rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae interactions.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Small-molecule hormones are well known to play key roles in the plant immune signaling network that is activated upon pathogen perception. In contrast, little is known about whether phytohormones also directly influence microbial virulence, similar to what has been reported in animal systems.

RESULTS: In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that hormones fulfill dual roles in plant-microbe interactions by orchestrating host immune responses, on the one hand, and modulating microbial virulence traits, on the other. Employing the rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) interaction as a model system, we show that Xoo uses the classic immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) as a trigger to activate its virulence-associated quorum sensing (QS) machinery. Despite repressing swimming motility, sodium salicylate (NaSA) induced production of the Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) and Diffusible Factor (DF) QS signals, with resultant accumulation of xanthomonadin and extracellular polysaccharides. In contrast, abscisic acid (ABA), which favors infection by Xoo, had little impact on DF- and DSF-mediated QS, but promoted bacterial swimming via the LuxR solo protein OryR. Moreover, we found both DF and DSF to influence SA- and ABA-responsive gene expression in planta.

CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings indicate that the rice SA and ABA signaling pathways cross-communicate with the Xoo DF and DSF QS systems and underscore the importance of bidirectional interkingdom signaling in molding plant-microbe interactions.
25624002	Characterization of rice small heat shock proteins targeted to different cellular organelles.	2015	Cell Stress Chaperones	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a family of ATP-independent molecular chaperones which prevent cellular protein aggregation by binding to misfolded proteins. sHSPs form large oligomers that undergo drastic rearrangement/dissociation in order to execute their chaperone activity in protecting substrates from stress. Substrate-binding sites on sHSPs have been predominantly mapped on their intrinsically disordered N-terminal arms. This region is highly variable in sequence and length across species, and has been implicated in both oligomer formation and in mediating chaperone activity. Here, we present our results on the functional and structural characterization of five sHSPs in rice, each differing in their subcellular localisation, viz., cytoplasm, nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisome. We performed activity assays and dynamic light scattering studies to highlight differences in the chaperone activity and quaternary assembly of sHSPs targeted to various organelles. By cloning constructs that differ in the length and sequence of the tag in the N-terminal region, we have probed the sensitivity of sHSP oligomer assembly and chaperone activity to the length and amino acid composition of the N-terminus. In particular, we have shown that the incorporation of an N-terminal tag has significant consequences on sHSP quaternary structure.
25616007	Prediction of methylmercury accumulation in rice grains by chemical extraction methods.	2015	Environ Pollut	To explore the possibility of using chemical extraction methods to predict phytoavailability/bioaccumulation of soil-bound MeHg, MeHg extractions by three widely-used extractants (CaCl2, DTPA, and (NH4)2S2O3) were compared with MeHg accumulation in rice grains. Despite of variations in characteristics of different soils, MeHg extracted by (NH4)2S2O3 (highly affinitive to MeHg) correlated well with grain MeHg levels. Thus (NH4)2S2O3 extraction, solubilizing not only weakly-bound and but also strongly-bound MeHg, may provide a measure of 'phytoavailable MeHg pool' for rice plants. Besides, a better prediction of grain MeHg levels was obtained when growing condition of rice plants was also considered. However, MeHg extracted by CaCl2 or DTPA, possibly quantifying 'exchangeable MeHg pool' or 'weakly-complexed MeHg pool' in soils, may not indicate phytoavailable MeHg or predict grain MeHg levels. Our results provided the possibility of predicting MeHg phytoavailability/bioaccumulation by (NH4)2S2O3 extraction, which could be useful in screening soils for rice cultivation in contaminated areas.
25637374	Elevated levels of CYP94 family gene expression alleviate the jasmonate response and enhance salt tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The plant hormone jasmonate and its conjugates (JAs) have important roles in growth control, leaf senescence and defense responses against insects and microbial attacks. JA biosynthesis is induced by several stresses, including mechanical wounding, pathogen attacks, drought and salinity stresses. However, the roles of JAs under abiotic stress conditions are unclear. Here we report that increased expression of the Cyt P450 family gene CYP94C2b enhanced viability of rice plants under saline conditions. This gene encodes an enzyme closely related to CYP94C1 that catalyzes conversion of bioactive jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) into 12OH-JA-Ile and 12COOH-JA-Ile. Inactivation of JA was facilitated in a rice line with enhanced CYP94C2b expression, and responses to exogenous JA and wounding were alleviated. Moreover, salt stress-induced leaf senescence but not natural senescence was delayed in the transgenic rice. These results suggest that bioactive JAs have a negative effect on viability under salt stress conditions and demonstrate that manipulating JA metabolism confers enhanced salt tolerance in rice.
25645894	A hemicellulose-bound form of silicon inhibits cadmium ion uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) cells.	2015	New Phytol	Silicon (Si) alleviates cadmium (Cd) toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the chemical mechanisms at the single-cell level are poorly understood. Here, a suspension of rice cells exposed to Cd and/or Si treatments was investigated using a combination of plant cell nutritional, molecular biological, and physical techniques including in situ noninvasive microtest technology (NMT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in Kelvin probe mode (KPFM). We found that Si-accumulating cells had a significantly reduced net Cd(2+) influx, compared with that in Si-limited cells. PCR analyses of the expression levels of Cd and Si transporters in rice cells showed that, when the Si concentration in the medium was increased, expression of the Si transporter gene Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) was up-regulated, whereas expression of the gene encoding the transporter involved in the transport of Cd, Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 5 (Nramp5), was down-regulated. ICP-MS results revealed that 64% of the total Si in the cell walls was bound to hemicellulose constituents following the fractionation of the cell walls, and consequently inhibited Cd uptake. Furthermore, AFM in KPFM demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the wall surface potential was higher in cells cultured in the presence of Si than in those cultured in its absence, and was homogenized after the addition of Cd. These results suggest that a hemicellulose-bound form of Si with net negative charges is responsible for inhibition of Cd uptake in rice cells by a mechanism of [Si-hemicellulose matrix]Cd complexation and subsequent co-deposition.
25646153	The extent of grain yield and plant growth enhancement by plant growth-promoting broad-spectrum Streptomyces sp. in chickpea.	2015	Springerplus	The physiological and molecular responses of five strains of Streptomyces sp. (CAI-17, CAI-68, CAI-78, KAI-26 and KAI-27), with their proven potential for charcoal rot disease control in sorghum and plant growth-promotion (PGP) in sorghum and rice, were studied to understand the mechanisms causing the beneficial effects. In this investigation, those five strains were evaluated for their PGP capabilities in chickpea in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 post-rainy seasons. All of the Streptomyces sp. strains exhibited enhanced nodule number, nodule weight, root weight and shoot weight at 30 days after sowing (DAS) and pod number, pod weight, leaf area, leaf weight and stem weight at 60 DAS in both seasons over the un-inoculated control. At crop maturity, the Streptomyces strains had enhanced stover yield, grain yield, total dry matter and seed number plant(-1) in both seasons over the un-inoculated control. In the rhizosphere, the Streptomyces sp. also significantly enhanced microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase activity, total nitrogen, available phosphorous and organic carbon in both seasons over the un-inoculated control. Of the five strains of Streptomyces sp., CAI-17, CAI-68 and CAI-78 were superior to KAI-26 and KAI-27 in terms of their effects on root and shoot development, nodule formation and crop productivity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs had revealed the success in colonization of the chickpea roots by all five strains. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of selected PGP genes of actinomycetes revealed the selective up-regulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-related and siderophore-related genes by CAI-68 and of β-1,3-glucanase genes by KAI-26.
25634987	Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing landscapes modulated during plant-virus interactions in Brachypodium distachyon.	2015	Plant Cell	In eukaryotes, alternative splicing (AS) promotes transcriptome and proteome diversity. The extent of genome-wide AS changes occurring during a plant-microbe interaction is largely unknown. Here, using high-throughput, paired-end RNA sequencing, we generated an isoform-level spliceome map of Brachypodium distachyon infected with Panicum mosaic virus and its satellite virus. Overall, we detected ∼44,443 transcripts in B. distachyon, ∼30% more than those annotated in the reference genome. Expression of ∼28,900 transcripts was ≥2 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments, and ∼42% of multi-exonic genes were alternatively spliced. Comparative analysis of AS patterns in B. distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), Arabidopsis thaliana, potato (Solanum tuberosum), Medicago truncatula, and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) revealed conserved ratios of the AS types between monocots and dicots. Virus infection quantitatively altered AS events in Brachypodium with little effect on the AS ratios. We discovered AS events for >100 immune-related genes encoding receptor-like kinases, NB-LRR resistance proteins, transcription factors, RNA silencing, and splicing-associated proteins. Cloning and molecular characterization of SCL33, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor, identified multiple novel intron-retaining splice variants that are developmentally regulated and modulated during virus infection. B. distachyon SCL33 splicing patterns are also strikingly conserved compared with a distant Arabidopsis SCL33 ortholog. This analysis provides new insights into AS landscapes conserved among monocots and dicots and uncovered AS events in plant defense-related genes.
25621512	Strigolactones, a novel carotenoid-derived plant hormone.	2015	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived plant hormones and signaling molecules. When released into the soil, SLs indicate the presence of a host to symbiotic fungi and root parasitic plants. In planta, they regulate several developmental processes that adapt plant architecture to nutrient availability. Highly branched/tillered mutants in Arabidopsis, pea, and rice have enabled the identification of four SL biosynthetic enzymes: a cis/trans-carotene isomerase, two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, and a cytochrome P450 (MAX1). In vitro and in vivo enzyme assays and analysis of mutants have shown that the pathway involves a combination of new reactions leading to carlactone, which is converted by a rice MAX1 homolog into an SL parent molecule with a tricyclic lactone moiety. In this review, we focus on SL biosynthesis, describe the hormonal and environmental factors that determine this process, and discuss SL transport and downstream signaling as well as the role of SLs in regulating plant development.
25655560	Molecular recognition of avirulence protein (avrxa5) by eukaryotic transcription factor xa5 of rice (Oryza sativa L.): insights from molecular dynamics simulations.	2015	J Mol Graph Model	The avirulence gene avrxa5 of bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) recognized by the resistant rice lines having corresponding resistance (xa5) gene in a gene-for-gene manner. We used a combinatorial approach involving protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations to gain novel insights into the gene-for-gene mechanism that governs the direct interaction of R-Avr protein. From the best three binding poses predicted by molecular docking, MD simulations were performed to explore the dynamic binding mechanism of xa5 and avrxa5. Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) techniques were employed to calculate the binding free energy and to uncover the thriving force behind the molecular recognition of avrxa5 by eukaryotic transcription factor xa5. Binding free energy analysis revealed van der Waals term as the most constructive component that favors the xa5 and avrxa5 interaction. In addition, hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and essential electrostatic interactions analysis highlighted amino acid residues Lys54/Asp870, Lys56/Ala868, Lys56/Ala866, Lys56/Glu871, Ile59/His862, Gly61/Phe858, His62/Arg841, His62/Leu856, Ser101/Ala872 and Ser105/Asp870 plays pivotal role for the energetically stability of the R-Avr complex. Insights gained from the present study are expected to unveil the molecular mechanisms that define the transcriptional activator mediated transcriptome modification in host plants.
25615266	Novel roles of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in regulating pectin synthesis and demethylesterification in the cell wall of rice (Oryza sativa) root tips.	2015	New Phytol	Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) has been reported to increase lignin formation, enhance cell wall rigidification, restrict cell expansion and inhibit root elongation. However, our results showed that it not only inhibited rice (Oryza sativa) root elongation, but also increased root diameter. No study has reported how and why H₂O₂ increases cell expansion and root diameter. Exogenous H₂O₂ and its scavenger 4-hydroxy-Tempo were applied to confirm the roles of H₂O₂. Immunofluorescence, fluorescence probe, ruthenium red staining, histological section and spectrophotometry were used to monitor changes in the degree of pectin methylesterification, pectin content, pectin methylesterase (PME) activity and H₂O₂ content. Exogenous H₂O₂ inhibited root elongation, but increased cell expansion and root diameter significantly. H₂O₂ not only increased the region of pectin synthesis and pectin content in root tips, but also increased PME activity and pectin demethylesterification. The scavenger 4-hydroxy-Tempo reduced root H₂O₂ content and recovered H₂O₂-induced increases in cell expansion and root diameter by inhibiting pectin synthesis, PME activity and pectin demethylesterification. H₂O₂ plays a novel role in the regulation of pectin synthesis, PME activity and pectin demethylesterification. H₂O₂ increases cell expansion and root diameter by increasing pectin content and demethylesterification.
25627217	Induced jasmonate signaling leads to contrasting effects on root damage and herbivore performance.	2015	Plant Physiol	Induced defenses play a key role in plant resistance against leaf feeders. However, very little is known about the signals that are involved in defending plants against root feeders and how they are influenced by abiotic factors. We investigated these aspects for the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and two root-feeding insects: the generalist cucumber beetle (Diabrotica balteata) and the more specialized rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus). Rice plants responded to root attack by increasing the production of jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid, whereas in contrast to in herbivore-attacked leaves, salicylic acid and ethylene levels remained unchanged. The JA response was decoupled from flooding and remained constant over different soil moisture levels. Exogenous application of methyl JA to the roots markedly decreased the performance of both root herbivores, whereas abscisic acid and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid did not have any effect. JA-deficient antisense 13-lipoxygenase (asLOX) and mutant allene oxide cyclase hebiba plants lost more root biomass under attack from both root herbivores. Surprisingly, herbivore weight gain was decreased markedly in asLOX but not hebiba mutant plants, despite the higher root biomass removal. This effect was correlated with a herbivore-induced reduction of sucrose pools in asLOX roots. Taken together, our experiments show that jasmonates are induced signals that protect rice roots from herbivores under varying abiotic conditions and that boosting jasmonate responses can strongly enhance rice resistance against root pests. Furthermore, we show that a rice 13-lipoxygenase regulates root primary metabolites and specifically improves root herbivore growth.
25620876	Fine mapping of <i>RBG2</i>, a quantitative trait locus for resistance to <i>Burkholderia glumae</i>, on rice chromosome 1.	None	Mol Breed	Bacterial grain rot (BGR), caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae, is a destructive disease of rice. At anthesis, rice panicles are attacked by the pathogen, and the infection causes unfilled or aborted grains, reducing grain yield and quality. Thus, increasing the level of BGR resistance is an important objective for rice breeding. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on rice chromosome 1 that controls BGR resistance was previously detected in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between Kele, a resistant traditional lowland cultivar (indica) that originated in India, and Hitomebore, a susceptible modern lowland cultivar (temperate japonica) from Japan. Further genetic analyses using a BC3F6 population derived from a cross between a resistant BIL (BC2F5) and Hitomebore confirmed that a QTL for BGR resistance was located on the long arm of chromosome 1. To define more precisely the chromosomal region underlying this QTL, we identified nine BC2F6 plants in which recombination occurred near the QTL. Substitution mapping using homozygous recombinant and nonrecombinant plants demonstrated that the QTL, here designated as Resistance to Burkholderia glumae 2 (RBG2), was located in a 502-kb interval defined by simple sequence repeat markers RM1216 and RM11727.
25643735	Destabilization of interaction between cytokinin signaling intermediates AHP1 and ARR4 modulates Arabidopsis development.	2015	New Phytol	Eukaryotic two-component signaling involves the His-Asp-His-Asp multistep phosphorelay (MSP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, cytokinin-mediated MSP signaling intermediates include histidine kinases (HKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (Hpts) and response regulators (RRs). The structure-function relationship of interaction between Hpt (e.g. AHP1) and RR (e.g. ARR4) is poorly understood. Using a homology model and yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified key amino acids of ARR4 at the AHP1-ΔARR4((16-175)) interaction interface. Mutating them in Arabidopsis (arr3,4,5,6,8,9 hextuple mutant background) and performing root length assays provided functional relevance, and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assay provided biochemical evidence for the interaction. The homology model mimics crystal structures of Hpt-RR complexes. Mutating selected interface residues of ARR4 either abolished or destabilized the interaction. D45A and Y96A mutations weakened interaction with AHP1, and exhibited weaker rescue of root elongation in the hextuple mutants. CoIP analysis using cytokinin-treated transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings provided biochemical evidence for weakened AHP1-ARR4 interaction. The relevance of the selected residues for the interaction was further validated in two independent pairs of Hpt-RR proteins from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). Our data provide evidence of a link between Hpt-RR interaction affinity and regulation of downstream functions of RRs. This establishes a structure-function relationship for the final step of a eukaryotic MSP signal cascade.
25607985	The phylogenetically-related pattern recognition receptors EFR and XA21 recruit similar immune signaling components in monocots and dicots.	2015	PLoS Pathog	During plant immunity, surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The transfer of PRRs between plant species is a promising strategy for engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance. Thus, there is a great interest in understanding the mechanisms of PRR-mediated resistance across different plant species. Two well-characterized plant PRRs are the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) EFR and XA21 from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and rice, respectively. Interestingly, despite being evolutionary distant, EFR and XA21 are phylogenetically closely related and are both members of the sub-family XII of LRR-RKs that contains numerous potential PRRs. Here, we compared the ability of these related PRRs to engage immune signaling across the monocots-dicots taxonomic divide. Using chimera between Arabidopsis EFR and rice XA21, we show that the kinase domain of the rice XA21 is functional in triggering elf18-induced signaling and quantitative immunity to the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the EFR:XA21 chimera associates dynamically in a ligand-dependent manner with known components of the EFR complex. Conversely, EFR associates with Arabidopsis orthologues of rice XA21-interacting proteins, which appear to be involved in EFR-mediated signaling and immunity in Arabidopsis. Our work indicates the overall functional conservation of immune components acting downstream of distinct LRR-RK-type PRRs between monocots and dicots.
25576299	Impact of insect-resistant GM rice on pesticide use and farmers' health in China.	2015	Sci China Life Sci	The economic benefits of insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) crops have been well documented, but the impact of such crops and the consequent reduction in pesticide use on farmers' health remains largely unknown. Through the analysis of the data collected from the physical examination from farmers in China, we show that GM rice significantly reduces pesticide use and the resultant not only visible but also invisible adverse effects on farmers' neurological, hematological, and electrolyte system. Hence, the commercialization of GM rice is expected to improve the health of farmers in developing countries, where pesticide application is necessary to mitigate crop loss.
25582220	Simple screening strategy with only water bath needed for the identification of insect-resistant genetically modified rice.	2015	Anal Chem	An informative, with simple instrument needed, rapid and easily updated strategy for the identification of insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) rice has been described. Such strategy is based on a parallel series of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reactions targeting the rice endogenous gene sucrose phosphate synthase (Sps), the top two most frequently used genetic elements (Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator (Nos) and Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S)), and an insect-resistant specific gene (Cry1Ac) and detected visually by phosphate ion (Pi)-induced coloration reaction. After a logical judgment of visible readouts has been obtained, three popular insect-resistant GM rice events in China can be successfully identified within 35 min, using either microwell strips or paper bases.
25587938	Differential effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles on rice, wheat, and barley roots: a fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy study.	2015	Appl Spectrosc	Cerium oxide nanoparticles (nCeO2) have extensive industrial applications, and concerns regarding their threat to the environment have been raised. This study includes structural analysis of intact root xylem of rice (Oryza sativaL.), wheat (Triticum aestivumL.), and barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) seedlings exposed to nCeO2 suspensions (0, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 mg L(-1)). Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy was applied to determine compositional alterations in the root xylem, and principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to examine spectral differences between nCeO2 treatments. Results demonstrated that nCeO2 at ≥ 125 mg L(-1) changed the region of spectra around 1696-1760 cm(-1) in rice root, 125 and 250 mg L(-1) modified 1744-1792 cm(-1) in wheat, and 62.5 and 125 mg L(-1) altered 1727-1760 cm(-1) in barley. PCA afforded the clustering of nCeO2 treatments at 0 and 62.5 mg L(-1) in rice and wheat and 0 and 500 mg L(-1) in barley. Furthermore, major peaks at 1744 or 1760 cm(-1) appeared in primary PC and 1728 cm(-1) in secondary PC score loadings. These findings illustrated that nCeO2 induced compositional modifications in the root xylem of cereals.
25928563	Transcriptome changes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in response to high night temperature stress at the early milky stage.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice yield and quality are adversely affected by high temperatures, especially at night; high nighttime temperatures are more harmful to grain weight than high daytime temperatures. Unfortunately, global temperatures are consistently increasing at an alarming rate and the minimum nighttime temperature has increased three times as much as the corresponding maximum daytime temperature over the past few decades.

RESULTS: We analyzed the transcriptome profiles for rice grain from heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines in response to high night temperatures at the early milky stage using the Illumina Sequencing method. The analysis results for the sequencing data indicated that 35 transcripts showed different expressions between heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice, and RT-qPCR analyses confirmed the expression patterns of selected transcripts. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts indicated that 21 genes have functional annotation and their functions are mainly involved in oxidation-reduction (6 genes), metabolic (7 genes), transport (4 genes), transcript regulation (2 genes), defense response (1 gene) and photosynthetic (1 gene) processes. Based on the functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes, the possible process that regulates these differentially expressed transcripts in rice grain responding to high night temperature stress at the early milky stage was further analyzed. This analysis indicated that high night temperature stress disrupts electron transport in the mitochondria, which leads to changes in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the mitochondrial and cellular matrix and influences the activity of enzymes involved in TCA and its secondary metabolism in plant cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Using Illumina sequencing technology, the differences between the transcriptomes of heat-tolerant and -sensitive rice lines in response to high night temperature stress at the early milky stage was described here for the first time. The candidate transcripts may provide genetic resources that may be useful in the improvement of heat-tolerant characters of rice. The model proposed here is based on differences in expression and transcription between two rice lines. In addition, the model may support future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to high night temperatures.
25627243	Genome-wide association mapping of salinity tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	DNA Res	Salinity tolerance in rice is highly desirable to sustain production in areas rendered saline due to various reasons. It is a complex quantitative trait having different components, which can be dissected effectively by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Here, we implemented GWAS to identify loci controlling salinity tolerance in rice. A custom-designed array based on 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in as many stress-responsive genes, distributed at an average physical interval of <100 kb on 12 rice chromosomes, was used to genotype 220 rice accessions using Infinium high-throughput assay. Genetic association was analysed with 12 different traits recorded on these accessions under field conditions at reproductive stage. We identified 20 SNPs (loci) significantly associated with Na(+)/K(+) ratio, and 44 SNPs with other traits observed under stress condition. The loci identified for various salinity indices through GWAS explained 5-18% of the phenotypic variance. The region harbouring Saltol, a major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosome 1 in rice, which is known to control salinity tolerance at seedling stage, was detected as a major association with Na(+)/K(+) ratio measured at reproductive stage in our study. In addition to Saltol, we also found GWAS peaks representing new QTLs on chromosomes 4, 6 and 7. The current association mapping panel contained mostly indica accessions that can serve as source of novel salt tolerance genes and alleles. The gene-based SNP array used in this study was found cost-effective and efficient in unveiling genomic regions/candidate genes regulating salinity stress tolerance in rice.
23028921	Genome dynamics explain the evolution of flowering time CCT domain gene families in the Poaceae.	2012	PLoS One	Numerous CCT domain genes are known to control flowering in plants. They belong to the CONSTANS-like (COL) and PREUDORESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) gene families, which in addition to a CCT domain possess B-box or response-regulator domains, respectively. Ghd7 is the most recently identified COL gene to have a proven role in the control of flowering time in the Poaceae. However, as it lacks B-box domains, its inclusion within the COL gene family, technically, is incorrect. Here, we show Ghd7 belongs to a larger family of previously uncharacterized Poaceae genes which possess just a single CCT domain, termed here CCT MOTIF FAMILY (CMF) genes. We molecularly describe the CMF (and related COL and PRR) gene families in four sequenced Poaceae species, as well as in the draft genome assembly of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Genetic mapping of the ten barley CMF genes identified, as well as twelve previously unmapped HvCOL and HvPRR genes, finds the majority map to colinear positions relative to their Poaceae orthologues. Combined inter-/intra-species comparative and phylogenetic analysis of CMF, COL and PRR gene families indicates they evolved prior to the monocot/dicot divergence ∼200 mya, with Poaceae CMF evolution described as the interplay between whole genome duplication in the ancestral cereal, and subsequent clade-specific mutation, deletion and duplication events. Given the proven role of CMF genes in the modulation of cereals flowering, the molecular, phylogenetic and comparative analysis of the Poaceae CMF, COL and PRR gene families presented here provides the foundation from which functional investigation can be undertaken.
20518745	One-carbon metabolism in plants: characterization of a plastid serine hydroxymethyltransferase.	2010	Biochem J	SHMT (serine hydroxymethyltransferase; EC 2.1.2.1) catalyses reversible hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to H4PteGlun (tetrahydrofolate), yielding glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. In plastids, SHMTs are thought to catalytically direct the hydroxymethyl moiety of serine into the metabolic network of H4PteGlun-bound one-carbon units. Genes encoding putative plastid SHMTs were found in the genomes of various plant species. SHMT activity was detected in chloroplasts in pea (Pisum sativum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), suggesting that plastid SHMTs exist in all flowering plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes one putative plastid SHMT (AtSHMT3). Its cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and the encoded recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli. Evidence that AtSHMT3 is targeted to plastids was found by confocal microscopy of A. thaliana protoplasts transformed with proteins fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein. Characterization of recombinant AtSHMT3 revealed that substrate affinity for and the catalytic efficiency of H4PteGlu1-8 increase with n, and that H4PteGlu1-8 inhibit AtSHMT3. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with one and five glutamate residues inhibited AtSHMT3-catalysed hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to H4PteGlu6, with the pentaglutamylated inhibitors being more effective. Calculations revealed inhibition with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate resulting in little reduction in AtSHMT3 activity under folate concentrations estimated for plastids.
17031029	Sequential regulation of gibberellin, brassinosteroid, and jasmonic acid biosynthesis occurs in rice coleoptiles to control the transcript levels of anti-microbial thionin genes.	2006	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Transcripts of thionin genes encoding antimicrobial peptides were present at a high level in rice coleoptiles just after germination, and decreased to an undetectable level after about 3 d, but this decline was suppressed by co-treatment with gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and brassinolide (BL). The temporal expression patterns of key enzyme genes for the biosyntheses of gibberellins (GAs) and brassinosteroids (BRs) were correlated with the fluctuation of thionin mRNAs. Jasmonic acid (JA) replaced the effect of GA3 and BL, and its change in endogenous level was parallel to that of the thionin genes. These results strongly suggest that thionin gene expression was positively regulated by JA, whose endogenous level was synergistically regulated by GAs and BRs. In contrast, thionin gene expression in etiolated seedlings remained high while the endogenous level of JA was low, suggesting the presence of another signaling pathway in the dark to maintain the thionin level.
18790996	The ATG autophagic conjugation system in maize: ATG transcripts and abundance of the ATG8-lipid adduct are regulated by development and nutrient availability.	2009	Plant Physiol	Plants employ sophisticated mechanisms to recycle intracellular constituents needed for growth, development, and survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. Autophagy is one important route in which cytoplasm and organelles are sequestered in bulk into vesicles and subsequently delivered to the vacuole for breakdown by resident hydrolases. The formation and trafficking of autophagic vesicles are directed in part by associated conjugation cascades that couple the AUTOPHAGY-RELATED8 (ATG8) and ATG12 proteins to their respective targets, phosphatidylethanolamine and the ATG5 protein. To help understand the importance of autophagy to nutrient remobilization in cereals, we describe here the ATG8/12 conjugation cascades in maize (Zea mays) and examine their dynamics during development, leaf senescence, and nitrogen and fixed-carbon starvation. From searches of the maize genomic sequence using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) counterparts as queries, we identified orthologous loci encoding all components necessary for ATG8/12 conjugation, including a five-member gene family expressing ATG8. Alternative splicing was evident for almost all Atg transcripts, which could have important regulatory consequences. In addition to free ATG8, its membrane-associated, lipidated form was detected in many maize tissues, suggesting that its conjugation cascade is active throughout the plant at most, if not all, developmental stages. Levels of Atg transcripts and/or the ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine adduct increase during leaf senescence and nitrogen and fixed-carbon limitations, indicating that autophagy plays a key role in nutrient remobilization. The description of the maize ATG system now provides a battery of molecular and biochemical tools to study autophagy in this crop under field conditions.
16284308	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 is a plant-specific SEC12-related protein that enables the endoplasmic reticulum exit of a high-affinity phosphate transporter in Arabidopsis.	2005	Plant Cell	PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) genes encode phosphate (Pi) transporters that play a fundamental role in Pi acquisition and remobilization in plants. Mutation of the Arabidopsis thaliana PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) impairs Pi transport, resulting in the constitutive expression of many Pi starvation-induced genes, increased arsenate resistance, and reduced Pi accumulation. PHF1 expression was detected in all tissues, particularly in roots, flowers, and senescing leaves, and was induced by Pi starvation, thus mimicking the expression patterns of the whole PHT1 gene family. PHF1 was localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mutation of PHF1 resulted in ER retention and reduced accumulation of the plasma membrane PHT1;1 transporter. By contrast, the PIP2A plasma membrane protein was not mislocalized, and the secretion of Pi starvation-induced RNases was not affected in the mutant. PHF1 encodes a plant-specific protein structurally related to the SEC12 proteins of the early secretory pathway. However, PHF1 lacks most of the conserved residues in SEC12 proteins essential as guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Although it functions in early secretory trafficking, PHF1 likely evolved a novel mechanism accompanying functional specialization on Pi transporters. The identification of PHF1 reveals that plants are also endowed with accessory proteins specific for selected plasma membrane proteins, allowing their exit from the ER, and that these ER exit cofactors may have a phylum-specific origin.
11726707	A Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase that endows rice plants with cold- and salt-stress tolerance functions in vascular bundles.	2001	Plant Cell Physiol	A rice Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK7, is a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to cold and salt/drought. We carried out in situ detection of the transcript and immunolocalization of the protein. In the wild-type rice plants under both stress conditions, OsCDPK7 was expressed predominantly in vascular tissues of crowns and roots, vascular bundles and central cylinder, respectively, where water stress occurs most severely. This enzyme was also expressed in the peripheral cylinder of crown vascular bundles and root sclerenchyma. Similar localization patterns with stronger signals were observed in stress-tolerant OsCDPK7 over-expressing transformants with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The transcript of a putative target gene of the OsCDPK7 signaling pathway, rab16A, was also detected essentially in the same tissues upon salt stress, suggesting that the OsCDPK7 pathway operates predominantly in these regions. We propose that the use of the 35S promoter fortuitously strengthened the localized expression of OsCDPK7, resulting in enhancement of the stress signaling in the inherently operating regions leading to improved stress tolerance.
8883374	The rab16B promoter of rice contains two distinct abscisic acid-responsive elements.	1996	Plant Physiol	To localize abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible gene expression of rab16 genes, rab16A promoter was linked to the gusA reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase and introduced into rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants. The activity of rab16A promoter was induced by ABA and osmotic stresses in various tissues of vegetative and floral organs. In anthers and embryos, rab16A promoter was active in the absence of ABA. To elucidate cis-elements of the rab16 promoter that confer ABA-inducible expression, variously modified 40-bp fragments (-264 to -225) of the rab16B promoter were fused to a truncated (-46 bp) cauliflower mosaic virus 35S minimal promoter, and their activities in protoplasts were analyzed. The transient assays revealed that the 40-bp fragment consists of two separate ABA-responsive elements, motif 1 (AGTACGTGGC) and motif III (GCCGCGTGGC). Motif I and motif III are both required for ABA induction; however, each can substitute for the other. Further analyses of these motifs indicated that motif III has a distinct DNA sequence specificity as an ABA-responsive element from motif I, suggesting that the two motifs interact with different transcription factors in vivo.
15208422	Comparative genomics of rice and Arabidopsis. Analysis of 727 cytochrome P450 genes and pseudogenes from a monocot and a dicot.	2004	Plant Physiol	Data mining methods have been used to identify 356 Cyt P450 genes and 99 related pseudogenes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome using sequence information available from both the indica and japonica strains. Because neither of these genomes is completely available, some genes have been identified in only one strain, and 28 genes remain incomplete. Comparison of these rice genes with the 246 P450 genes and 26 pseudogenes in the Arabidopsis genome has indicated that most of the known plant P450 families existed before the monocot-dicot divergence that occurred approximately 200 million years ago. Comparative analysis of P450s in the Pinus expressed sequence tag collections has identified P450 families that predated the separation of gymnosperms and flowering plants. Complete mapping of all available plant P450s onto the Deep Green consensus plant phylogeny highlights certain lineage-specific families maintained (CYP80 in Ranunculales) and lineage-specific families lost (CYP92 in Arabidopsis) in the course of evolution.
22645574	Molecular Evolution of Plant AAP and LHT Amino Acid Transporters.	2012	Front Plant Sci	Nitrogen is an essential mineral nutrient and it is often transported within living organisms in its reduced form, as amino acids. Transport of amino acids across cellular membranes requires proteins, and here we report the phylogenetic analysis across taxa of two amino acid transporter families, the amino acid permeases (AAPs) and the lysine-histidine-like transporters (LHTs). We found that the two transporter families form two distinct groups in plants supporting the concept that both are essential. AAP transporters seem to be restricted to land plants. They were found in Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens but not in Chlorophyte, Charophyte, or Rhodophyte algae. AAPs were strongly represented in vascular plants, consistent with their major function in phloem (vascular tissue) loading of amino acids for sink nitrogen supply. LHTs on the other hand appeared prior to land plants. LHTs were not found in chlorophyte algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carterii. However, the characean alga Klebsormidium flaccidum encodes KfLHT13 and phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is basal to land plant LHTs. This is consistent with the hypothesis that characean algae are ancestral to land plants. LHTs were also found in both S. moellendorffii and P. patens as well as in monocots and eudicots. To date, AAPs and LHTs have mainly been characterized in Arabidopsis (eudicots) and these studies provide clues to the functions of the newly identified homologs.
12355160	OsBIMK1, a rice MAP kinase gene involved in disease resistance responses.	2002	Planta	The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has been previously implicated in signal transduction during plant responses to pathogen attack as well as to various environmental stresses. We have isolated from rice a new MAPK cDNA, OsBIMK1 ( O ryza s ativa L. BTH-induced MAPK 1), which encodes a 369-amino-acid protein with moderate to high nucleotide sequence similarity to previously reported plant MAPK genes. OsBIMK1 contains all 11 of the MAPK conserved subdomains and the phosphorylation-activation motif, TEY. We analyzed in detail the expression of OsBIMK1 upon treatment with various chemical and biological inducers of resistance responses in rice and in both incompatible and compatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea. Expression of OsBIMK1 was activated rapidly upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) as well as with dichloroisonicotinic acid, probenazole, jasmonic acid and its methyl ester, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, or wounding. Expression of OsBIMK1 was induced rapidly during the first 36 h after inoculation with M. grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and in an incompatible interaction between M. grisea and a blast-resistant rice genotype. BTH treatment induced a systemic activation of OsBIMK1 expression. These results suggest that OsBIMK1 plays an important role in rice disease resistance.
15608331	Arabidopsis membrane steroid binding protein 1 is involved in inhibition of cell elongation.	2005	Plant Cell	A putative Membrane Steroid Binding Protein (designated MSBP1) was identified and functionally characterized as a negative regulator of cell elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MSBP1 gene encodes a 220-amino acid protein that can bind to progesterone, 5-dihydrotestosterone, 24-epi-brassinolide (24-eBL), and stigmasterol with different affinities in vitro. Transgenic plants overexpressing MSBP1 showed short hypocotyl phenotype and increased steroid binding capacity in membrane fractions, whereas antisense MSBP1 transgenic plants showed long hypocotyl phenotypes and reduced steroid binding capacity, indicating that MSBP1 negatively regulates hypocotyl elongation. The reduced cell elongation of MSBP1-overexpressing plants was correlated with altered expression of genes involved in cell elongation, such as expansins and extensins, indicating that enhanced MSBP1 affected a regulatory pathway for cell elongation. Suppression or overexpression of MSBP1 resulted in enhanced or reduced sensitivities, respectively, to exogenous progesterone and 24-eBL, suggesting a negative role of MSBP1 in steroid signaling. Expression of MSBP1 in hypocotyls is suppressed by darkness and activated by light, suggesting that MSBP1, as a negative regulator of cell elongation, plays a role in plant photomorphogenesis. This study demonstrates the functional roles of a steroid binding protein in growth regulation in higher plants.
7994178	Inefficient rpl2 splicing in barley mutants with ribosome-deficient plastids.	1994	Plant Cell	Analysis of transcript accumulation and splicing in plastids of four nuclear mutants of barley revealed that the ribosomal protein L2 (rpl2) gene transcripts containing a group II intron remained entirely unspliced, whereas the intron of the ribosomal protein L16 (rpl16) gene (linked with the rpl2 gene in the same operon) was removed in the mutant plastids. Also, the transcripts of other genes containing group II introns (ribosomal protein S16 gene, rps16; NADH dehydrogenase ND2 gene, ndhB; cytochrome f gene, petD; and intron-containing reading frame 170, irf170) and of the tRNA for leucine, trnL (UAA), possessing the only chloroplast group I intron, were found to be spliced. The mutants used in this investigation are considered to be nonallelic; this excludes the possibility that a single nuclear gene is responsible for the impaired splicing of rpl2 transcripts. The mutants, however, have a severe deficiency in chloroplast ribosomes in common; this deficiency is evident from the lack of the essential ribosomal protein L2 and from an extremely low steady state level of plastid rRNAs. From these results, we conclude that a functioning translational apparatus of the organelle is a prerequisite for splicing of the chloroplast rpl2 class II intron but not for splicing of at least five other group II intron-containing transcripts. This provides genetic evidence for a chloroplast DNA-encoded component (e.g., a maturase) involved in the splicing of rpl2 pre-mRNA.
20192745	Diversification of P450 genes during land plant evolution.	2010	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Plant cytochromes P450 (P450s) catalyze a wide variety of monooxygenation/hydroxylation reactions in primary and secondary metabolism. The number of P450 genes in plant genomes is estimated to be up to 1% of total gene annotations of each plant species. This implies that diversification within P450 gene superfamilies has led to the emergence of new metabolic pathways throughout land plant evolution. The conserved P450 families contribute to chemical defense mechanisms under terrestrial conditions and several are involved in hormone biosynthesis and catabolism. Species-specific P450 families are essential for the biosynthetic pathways of species-specialized metabolites. Future genome-wide analyses of P450 gene clusters and coexpression networks should help both in identifying the functions of many orphan P450s and in understanding the evolution of this versatile group of enzymes.
21421368	Isoforms of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in rice root and shoot are differentially induced by starvation and resupply of NO₃⁻ or NH₄+.	2011	Plant Sci	The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen starvation and resupply in 10 PM H+-ATPase isoforms and the expression of NO₃⁻ and NH₄+ transporters in rice. The net uptake of both forms of NO₃⁻-N or NH₄+-N was increased with its resupply. Resupply of NO₃⁻ resulted in induction of the following PM H+-ATPase isoforms, OsA1, OsA2, OsA5 and OsA7 in the shoots and OsA2, OsA5, OsA7 and OsA8 in the roots. Resupply of NH₄+ resulted in the induction of the following OsA1, OsA3 and OsA7 isoforms in the roots while OsA1 was induced in the shoots. It was observed that increased PM H+-ATPase activity also resulted in increased net uptake of NO₃⁻ and NH₄+. In the roots, OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 were induced by NO₃⁻ resupply, while OsAMT1.1 and OsAMT1.2 were induced by NH₄+ deficiency. The results showed that the expression of PM H+-ATPase isoforms is related to NO₃⁻ and NH₄+ transporters as well as in which section of the plant it takes place. PM H+-ATPase isoforms OsA2 and OsA7 displayed the strongest induction in response to N resupply, therefore indicating that these genes could be involved in N uptake in rice.
22404471	Iron uptake, translocation, and regulation in higher plants.	2012	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Iron is essential for the survival and proliferation of all plants. Higher plants have developed two distinct strategies to acquire iron, which is only slightly soluble, from the rhizosphere: the reduction strategy of nongraminaceous plants and the chelation strategy of graminaceous plants. Key molecular components-including transporters, enzymes, and chelators-have been clarified for both strategies, and many of these components are now thought to also function inside the plant to facilitate internal iron transport. Transporters for intracellular iron trafficking are also being clarified. A majority of genes encoding these components are transcriptionally regulated in response to iron availability. Recent research has uncovered central transcription factors, cis-acting elements, and molecular mechanisms regulating these genes. Manipulation of these molecular components has produced transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to iron deficiency or with increased iron content in the edible parts.
20217243	Identification of Fe-excess-induced genes in rice shoots reveals a WRKY transcription factor responsive to Fe, drought and senescence.	2010	Mol Biol Rep	Fe participates in several important reactions in plant metabolism. However, Fe homeostasis in plants is not completely understood, and molecular studies on Fe-excess stress are scarce. Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) is largely cultivated in submerged conditions, where the extremely reductive environment can lead to severe Fe overload. In this work, we used representational difference analysis (RDA) to isolate sequences up-regulated in rice shoots after exposure to Fe-excess. We isolated 24 sequences which have putative functions in distinct cellular processes, such as transcription regulation (OsWRKY80), stress response (OsGAP1, DEAD-BOX RNA helicase), proteolysis (oryzain-α, rhomboid protein), photosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b binding protein), sugar metabolism (β glucosidase) and electron transport (NADH ubiquinone oxireductase). We show that the putative WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY80 is up-regulated in rice leaves, stems and roots after Fe-excess treatment. This up-regulation is also observed after dark-induced senescence and drought stress, indicating that OsWRKY80 could be a general stress-responsive gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an Fe-excess-induced transcription factor in plants.
15200956	Computational identification of plant microRNAs and their targets, including a stress-induced miRNA.	2004	Mol Cell	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs, some of which have been shown to play important gene-regulatory roles during plant development. We developed comparative genomic approaches to systematically identify both miRNAs and their targets that are conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). Twenty-three miRNA candidates, representing seven newly identified gene families, were experimentally validated in Arabidopsis, bringing the total number of reported miRNA genes to 92, representing 22 families. Nineteen newly identified target candidates were confirmed by detecting mRNA fragments diagnostic of miRNA-directed cleavage in plants. Overall, plant miRNAs have a strong propensity to target genes controlling development, particularly those of transcription factors and F-box proteins. However, plant miRNAs have conserved regulatory functions extending beyond development, in that they also target superoxide dismutases, laccases, and ATP sulfurylases. The expression of miR395, the sulfurylase-targeting miRNA, increases upon sulfate starvation, showing that miRNAs can be induced by environmental stress.
19796675	Identification of novel stress-regulated microRNAs from Oryza sativa L.	2010	Genomics	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small non-coding RNA found in eukaryotes. They play a key role in gene expression by down-regulating gene expression and are involved in the environment stress response in plants. Although a large number of miRNAs have been identified from Arabidopsis, few studies have focused on Oryza sativa miRNAs, especially on stress-related miRNAs. Five cDNA libraries of small RNAs from rice seedlings treated with cold, dehydration, salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA), as well as wild-type seedlings, were constructed. Seven rice novel miRNAs were identified by Northern analysis, and their expression patterns under different stress treatments were determined. Results showed that the expression of several novel miRNAs was regulated by one or more stress treatments. Our identification of novel stress-related miRNAs in rice suggests that these miRNAs might be involved in rice stress response pathways.
25947154	Transcriptome diversity among rice root types during asymbiosis and interaction with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Root systems consist of different root types (RTs) with distinct developmental and functional characteristics. RTs may be individually reprogrammed in response to their microenvironment to maximize adaptive plasticity. Molecular understanding of such specific remodeling--although crucial for crop improvement--is limited. Here, RT-specific transcriptomes of adult rice crown, large and fine lateral roots were assessed, revealing molecular evidence for functional diversity among individual RTs. Of the three rice RTs, crown roots displayed a significant enrichment of transcripts associated with phytohormones and secondary cell wall (SCW) metabolism, whereas lateral RTs showed a greater accumulation of transcripts related to mineral transport. In nature, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis represents the default state of most root systems and is known to modify root system architecture. Rice RTs become heterogeneously colonized by AM fungi, with large laterals preferentially entering into the association. However, RT-specific transcriptional responses to AM symbiosis were quantitatively most pronounced for crown roots despite their modest physical engagement in the interaction. Furthermore, colonized crown roots adopted an expression profile more related to mycorrhizal large lateral than to noncolonized crown roots, suggesting a fundamental reprogramming of crown root character. Among these changes, a significant reduction in SCW transcripts was observed that was correlated with an alteration of SCW composition as determined by mass spectrometry. The combined change in SCW, hormone- and transport-related transcript profiles across the RTs indicates a previously overlooked switch of functional relationships among RTs during AM symbiosis, with a potential impact on root system architecture and functioning.
25985140	Natural alleles of a proteasome α2 subunit gene contribute to thermotolerance and adaptation of African rice.	2015	Nat Genet	Global warming threatens many aspects of human life, for example, by reducing crop yields. Breeding heat-tolerant crops using genes conferring thermotolerance is a fundamental way to help deal with this challenge. Here we identify a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for thermotolerance in African rice (Oryza glaberrima), Thermo-tolerance 1 (TT1), which encodes an α2 subunit of the 26S proteasome involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Ubiquitylome analysis indicated that OgTT1 protects cells from heat stress through more efficient elimination of cytotoxic denatured proteins and more effective maintenance of heat-response processes than achieved with OsTT1. Variation in TT1 has been selected for on the basis of climatic temperature and has had an important role in local adaptation during rice evolution. In addition, we found that overexpression of OgTT1 was associated with markedly enhanced thermotolerance in rice, Arabidopsis and Festuca elata. This discovery may lead to an increase in crop security in the face of the ongoing threat of global warming.
25957386	Regulation of histone methylation and reprogramming of gene expression in the rice inflorescence meristem.	2015	Plant Cell	Rice inflorescence meristem (IM) activity is essential for panicle development and grain production. How chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms regulate IM activity remains unclear. Genome-wide analysis revealed that in addition to genes involved in the vegetative to reproductive transition, many metabolic and protein synthetic genes were activated in IM compared with shoot apical meristem and that a change in the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio was an important factor for the differential expression of many genes. Thousands of genes gained or lost H3K27me3 in IM, and downregulation of the H3K27 methyltransferase gene SET DOMAIN GROUP 711 (SDG711) or mutation of the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many genes. SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 repressed several important genes involved in IM activity and many genes that are silent in the IM but activated during floral organogenesis or other developmental stages. SDG711 overexpression augmented IM activity and increased panicle size; suppression of SDG711 by RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size. These results suggest that SDG711 and JMJ703 have agonistic functions in reprogramming the H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio and modulating gene expression in the IM.
26021733	Changes in lipid substances in rice during grain development.	2015	Phytochemistry	Lipid substances, such as fatty acids, γ-oryzanol, policosanols, and tocol (tocopherol+tocotrienol), were investigated in two rice cultivars, Ilpum and Dasan, during rice development. In both cultivars, the lipid extract level decreased steadily after it reached its maximum level. Additionally, there were differences in the fatty acid composition, depending on the rice developmental stage, between the two cultivars. The γ-oryzanol level increased during rice development, and there were differences in the composition of γ-oryzanol between the two cultivars. The levels of policosanols drastically decreased during the early stage of rice development in the two cultivars. The total tocol level showed a downward trend during rice development. The predominant tocol isomer in Ilpum was α-tocopherol during rice development. In Dasan, the predominant tocol isomer was α-tocopherol at the early stage, but γ-tocotrienol at the later stage. This study provided information on the levels and composition of lipid substances, such as fatty acids, γ-oryzanol, policosanols, and tocol during rice development.
26002868	A Gibberellin-Mediated DELLA-NAC Signaling Cascade Regulates Cellulose Synthesis in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	Cellulose, which can be converted into numerous industrial products, has important impacts on the global economy. It has long been known that cellulose synthesis in plants is tightly regulated by various phytohormones. However, the underlying mechanism of cellulose synthesis regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that in rice (Oryza sativa), gibberellin (GA) signals promote cellulose synthesis by relieving the interaction between SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and NACs, the top-layer transcription factors for secondary wall formation. Mutations in GA-related genes and physiological treatments altered the transcription of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE genes (CESAs) and the cellulose level. Multiple experiments demonstrated that transcription factors NAC29/31 and MYB61 are CESA regulators in rice; NAC29/31 directly regulates MYB61, which in turn activates CESA expression. This hierarchical regulation pathway is blocked by SLR1-NAC29/31 interactions. Based on the results of anatomical analysis and GA content examination in developing rice internodes, this signaling cascade was found to be modulated by varied endogenous GA levels and to be required for internode development. Genetic and gene expression analyses were further performed in Arabidopsis thaliana GA-related mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism by which GA regulates secondary wall cellulose synthesis in land plants and provide a strategy for manipulating cellulose production and plant growth.
25991736	The Rice High-Affinity Potassium Transporter1;1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	2015	Plant Physiol	Sodium transporters play key roles in plant tolerance to salt stress. Here, we report that a member of the High-Affinity K(+) Transporter (HKT) family, OsHKT1;1, in rice (Oryza sativa 'Nipponbare') plays an important role in reducing Na(+) accumulation in shoots to cope with salt stress. The oshkt1;1 mutant plants displayed hypersensitivity to salt stress. They contained less Na(+) in the phloem sap and accumulated more Na(+) in the shoots compared with the wild type. OsHKT1;1 was expressed mainly in the phloem of leaf blades and up-regulated in response to salt stress. Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, a novel MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor, OsMYBc, was found to bind to the OsHKT1;1 promoter. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that OsMYBc binds to AAANATNC(C/T) fragments within the OsHKT1;1 promoter. Mutation of the OsMYBc-binding nucleotides resulted in a decrease in promoter activity of OsHKT1;1. Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity. Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na(+) concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor.
25954944	Regulation of OsmiR156h through Alternative Polyadenylation Improves Grain Yield in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Substantial increases in grain yield of cereal crops are required to feed a growing human population. Here we show that a natural variant of SEMIDWARF AND HIGH-TILLERING (SDT) increases harvest index and grain productivity in rice. Gain-of-function sdt mutation has a shortened polyadenylation tail on the OsmiR156h microRNA precursor, which cause the up-regulation of OsmiR156h. The plants carrying the semidominant sdt allele exhibit reduced plant height, enhanced lodging resistance, increased tiller numbers per plant, and resulting in an increased grain yield. We also show that combining the sdt allele with the OsSPL14WFP allele can be effective in simultaneously improving tillering capacity and panicle branching, thereby leading to higher harvest index and grain yield. Most importantly, pyramiding of the sdt allele and the green revolution gene sd1 enhances grain yield by about 20% in hybrid rice breeding. Our results suggest that the manipulation of the polyadenylation status of OsmiR156 represents a novel strategy for improving the yield potential of rice over what is currently achievable.
26037695	Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (OsI-BAK1) is associated with grain filling and leaf development in rice.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1)-Associated Kinase I (BAK1) has been reported to interact with BRI1 for brassinosteroid (BR) perception and signal transduction that regulate plant growth and development. The aim of this study is to investigate the functions of a rice OsBAK1 homologue, designated as OsI-BAK1, which is highly expressed after heading. Silencing of OsI-BAK1 in rice plants produced a high number of undeveloped green and unfilled grains compared to the untransformed plants. Histological analyses demonstrated that embryos were either absent or retarded in their development in these unfilled rice grains of OsI-BAK1 RNAi plants. Down regulation of OsI-BAK1 caused a reduction in cell number and enlargement in leaf bulliform cells. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsI-BAK1 were demonstrated to have corrugated and twisted leaves probably due to increased cell number that caused abnormal bulliform cell structure which were enlarged and plugged deep into leaf epidermis. The current findings suggest that OsI-BAK1 may play an important role in the developmental processes of rice grain filling and leaf cell including the bulliform cells.
25977235	OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.	2015	J Exp Bot	Large amounts of seed storage proteins (SSPs) are produced in the maturing endosperm of rice seeds. Rice SSPs are synthesized as secretory proteins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and are transported and deposited into protein complexes called protein bodies (PB-I and PB-II). Due to the high production of SSPs, unfolded SSPs may be generated during this process. However, it was previously unclear how such unfolded proteins are selected among synthesized products and removed from the ER to maintain protein quality in the endosperm. Since Hrd3/SEL1L recognizes unfolded proteins in yeast and mammalian protein quality control systems, the role of OsHrd3 in protein quality control in rice endosperm was investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsHrd3 interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts. Endosperm-specific suppression of OsHrd3 in transgenic rice reduced the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and resulted in unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endosperm, suggesting that OsHrd3-mediated polyubiquitination plays an important role in ER quality control. It was found that a cysteine-rich 13kDa prolamin, RM1, was polyubiquitinated in wild-type (WT) seeds but not in OsHrd3 knockdown (KD) seeds. RM1 formed aberrant aggregates that were deposited abnormally in OsHrd3 KD seeds, resulting in deformed PB-I. Therefore, the quality of protein bodies is maintained by polyubiquitination of unfolded SSPs through the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase system in rice endosperm.
26233894	Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.	2015	J Genet Genomics	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that silence genes through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is essential for plant development and adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. In Arabidopsis, miRNAs are implicated in ABA functions. However, ABA-responsive miRNAs have not been systematically studied in rice. Here high throughput sequencing of small RNAs revealed that 107 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the rice ABA deficient mutant, Osaba1. Of these, 13 were confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Among them, miR1425-5P, miR169a, miR169n, miR390-5P, miR397a and miR397b were up-regulated, but miR162b reduced in expression in Osaba1. The targets of these 13 miRNAs were predicted and validated by gene expression profiling. Interestingly, the expression levels of these miRNAs and their targets were regulated by ABA. Cleavage sites were detected on 7 of the miRNA targets by 5'-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'-RACE). Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1. Our work provides important information for further characterization and functional analysis of ABA-responsive miRNAs in rice.
25951042	Role of rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 in sugar signaling and metabolism.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	We characterized the function of the rice cytosolic hexokinase OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase7), which is highly upregulated when seeds germinate under O2 -deficient conditions. According to transient expression assays that used the promoter:luciferase fusion construct, OsHXK7 enhanced the glucose (Glc)-dependent repression of a rice α-amylase gene (RAmy3D) in the mesophyll protoplasts of maize, but its catalytically inactive mutant alleles did not. Consistently, the expression of OsHXK7, but not its catalytically inactive alleles, complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 (gin2-1) mutant, thereby resulting in the wild type characteristics of Glc-dependent repression, seedling development, and plant growth. Interestingly, OsHXK7-mediated Glc-dependent repression was abolished in the O2 -deficient mesophyll protoplasts of maize. This result provides compelling evidence that OsHXK7 functions in sugar signaling via a glycolysis-dependent manner under normal conditions, but its signaling role is suppressed when O2 is deficient. The germination of two null OsHXK7 mutants, oshxk7-1 and oshxk7-2, was affected by O2 deficiency, but overexpression enhanced germination in rice. This result suggests the distinct role that OsHXK7 plays in sugar metabolism and efficient germination by enforcing glycolysis-mediated fermentation in O2 -deficient rice.
26089149	Repression of microRNA biogenesis by silencing of OsDCL1 activates the basal resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	The RNaseIII enzyme Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) processes the microRNA biogenesis and plays a determinant role in plant development. In this study, we reported the function of OsDCL1 in the immunity to rice blast, the devastating disease caused by the fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. Expression profiling demonstrated that different OsDCLs responded dynamically and OsDCL1 reduced its expression upon the challenge of rice blast pathogen. In contrast, miR162a predicted to target OsDCL1 increased its expression, implying a negative feedback loop between OsDCL1 and miR162a in rice. In addition to developmental defects, the OsDCL1-silencing mutants showed enhanced resistance to virulent rice blast strains in a non-race specific manner. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and cell death were observed in the contact cells with infectious hyphae, revealing that silencing of OsDCL1 activated cellular defense responses. In OsDCL1 RNAi lines, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 5 and 7 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, indicating that miRNAs responded dynamically in the interaction between rice and rice blast. Moreover, silencing of OsDCL1 activated the constitutive expression of defense related genes. Taken together, our results indicate that rice is capable of activating basal resistance against rice blast by perturbing OsDCL1-dependent miRNA biogenesis pathway.
25956502	Evolutionary conservation of TORC1 components, TOR, Raptor, and LST8, between rice and yeast.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine kinase that functions as a central controller of cell growth. TOR protein is structurally defined by the presence several conserved domains such as the HEAT repeat, focal adhesion target (FAT), FKBP12/rapamycin binding (FRB), kinase, and FATC domains starting from the N-terminus. In most eukaryotes, TOR forms two distinct physical and functional complexes, which are termed as TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2. However, plants contain only TORC1 components, i.e., TOR, Raptor, and LST8. In this study, we analyzed the gene structure and functions of TORC components in rice to understand the properties of the TOR complex in plants. Comparison of the locations of introns in these genes among rice and other eukaryotes showed that they were well conserved among plants except for Chlamydomonas. Moreover, the intron positions in the coding sequence of human Raptor and LST8 were closer to those of plants than of fly or nematode. Complementation tests of rice TOR (OsTOR) components in yeast showed that although OsTOR did not complement yeast tor mutants, chimeric TOR, which consisted of the HEAT repeat and FAT domain from yeast and other regions from rice, rescued the tor mutants, indicating that the HEAT repeat and FAT domains are important for species-specific signaling. OsRaptor perfectly complemented a kog1 (yeast Raptor homolog) mutant, and OsLST8 partially complemented an lst8 mutant. Together, these data suggest the importance of the N-terminal region of the TOR, HEAT, and FAT domains for functional diversification of the TOR complex.
26023934	Rice osa-miR171c Mediates Phase Change from Vegetative to Reproductive Development and Shoot Apical Meristem Maintenance by Repressing Four OsHAM Transcription Factors.	2015	PLoS One	Phase change from vegetative to reproductive development is one of the critical developmental steps in plants, and it is regulated by both environmental and endogenous factors. The maintenance of shoot apical meristem (SAM) identity, miRNAs and flowering integrators are involved in this phase change process. Here, we report that the miRNA osa-miR171c targets four GRAS (GAI-RGA-SCR) plant-specific transcription factors (OsHAM1, OsHAM2, OsHAM3, and OsHAM4) to control the floral transition and maintenance of SAM indeterminacy in rice (Oryza sativa). We characterized a rice T-DNA insertion delayed heading (dh) mutant, where the expression of OsMIR171c gene is up-regulated. This mutant showed pleiotropic phenotypic defects, including especially prolonged vegetative phase, delayed heading date, and bigger shoot apex. Parallel expression analysis showed that osa-miR171c controlled the expression change of four OsHAMs in the shoot apex during floral transition, and responded to light. In the dh mutant, the expression of the juvenile-adult phase change negative regulator osa-miR156 was up-regulated, expression of the flowering integrators Hd3a and RFT1 was inhibited, and expression of FON4 negative regulators involved in the maintenance of SAM indeterminacy was also inhibited. From these data, we propose that the inhibition of osa-miR171c-mediated OsHAM transcription factors regulates the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive development by maintaining SAM indeterminacy and inhibiting flowering integrators.
25990214	Natural variations in OsγTMT contribute to diversity of the α-tocopherol content in rice.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively known as tocochromanols, are lipid-soluble molecules that belong to the group of vitamin E compounds. Among them, α-tocopherol (αΤ) is one of the antioxidants with diverse functions and benefits for humans and animals. Thus, understanding the genetic basis of these traits would be valuable to improve nutritional quality by breeding in rice. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has emerged as a powerful strategy for identifying genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying complex traits in plants. To discover the genes or QTLs underlying the naturally occurring variations of αΤ content in rice, we performed GWAS using 1.44 million high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms acquired from re-sequencing of 137 accessions from a diverse rice core collection. Thirteen candidate genes were found across 2-year phenotypic data, among which gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (OsγTMT) was identified as the major factor responsible for the αΤ content among rice accessions. Nucleotide variations in the coding region of OsγTMT were significantly associated with the αΤ content variations, while nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of OsγTMT also could partly demonstrate the correlation with αΤ content variations, according to our RNA expression analyses. This study provides useful information for genetic factors underlying αΤ content variations in rice, which will significantly contribute the research on αΤ biosynthesis mechanisms and αΤ improvement of rice.
26012744	OsWS1 involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis is regulated by osa-miR1848.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Cuticular wax forms a hydrophobic layer covering aerial plant organs and acting as a protective barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses. Compared with well-known wax biosynthetic pathway, molecular regulation of wax biosynthesis is less known. Here, we show that rice OsWS1, a member of the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase gene family, involved in wax biosynthesis and was regulated by an osa-miR1848. OsWS1-tagged green fluorescent protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Compared with wild-type rice, OsWS1 overexpression plants displayed a 3% increase in total wax, especially a 35% increase in very long-chain fatty acids, denser wax papillae around the stoma, more cuticular wax crystals formed on leaf and stem surfaces, pollen coats were thicker and more seedlings survived after water-deficit treatment. In contrast, OsWS1-RNAi and osa-miR1848 overexpression plants exhibited opposing changes. Gene expression analysis showed that overexpression of osa-miR1848 down-regulated OsWS1 transcripts; furthermore, expression profiles of OsWS1 and osa-miR1848 were inversely correlated in the leaf, panicle and stem, and upon water-deficit treatment. These results suggest that OsWS1 is regulated by osa-miR1848 and participates in cuticular wax formation.
26029232	Profiling the expression domains of a rice-specific microRNA under stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Plant microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression under normal as well as stressful environments. Rice is an important cereal crop whose productivity is compromised due to various abiotic stress factors such as salt, heat and drought. In the present study, we have investigated the role of rice-specific Osa-miR820, in indica rice cultivars showing contrasting response to salt stress. The dissection of expression patterns indicated that the miR is present in all the tissues but is enriched in the anther tissues. In salinity, the miR levels are up-regulated in the leaf tissues but down-regulated in the root tissues. To map the deregulation under salt stress comprehensive time kinetics of expression was performed in the leaf and root tissues. The reproductive stages were also analyzed under salt stress. It emerged that a common regulatory scheme for Osa-miR820 expression is present in the salt-susceptible Pusa Basmati 1 and salt-tolerant Pokkali varieties, although there is a variation in the levels of the miR and its target transcript, OsDRM2. The regulation of Osa-miR820 and its target were also studied under other abiotic stresses. This study thus captures the window for the miR-target correlation and the putative role of this regulation is discussed. This will help in gaining useful insights on the role of species specific miRs in plant development and abiotic stress response.
25990386	OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Mercury (Hg) is not only a threat to public health but also a growth risk factor to plants, as it is readily accumulated by higher plants. Accumulation of Hg in plants disrupts many cellular-level functions and inhibits growth and development; however, the detoxification and tolerance mechanisms of plants to Hg stress are still not fully understood. Exposure to toxic Hg also occurs in some crops cultivated under anoxic conditions, such as rice (Oryza sativa L.), a model organism and one of the most important cultivated plants worldwide. In this study, we functionally characterized a rice translationally controlled tumor protein gene (Os11g43900, OsTCTP) involved in Hg stress tolerance.

RESULTS: OsTCTP was ubiquitously expressed in all examined plant tissues, especially in actively dividing and differentiating tissues, such as roots and nodes. OsTCTP was found to localize both the cytosol and the nucleus. OsTCTP was induced by mercuric chloride, cupric sulfate, abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide at the protein level in a time-dependent manner. Overexpression of OsTCTP potentiated the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, reduced the Hg-induced H2O2 levels, and promoted Hg tolerance in rice, whereas knockdown of OsTCTP produced opposite effects. And overexpression of OsTCTP did not prevent Hg absorption and accumulation in rice. We also demonstrated that Asn 48 and Asn 97 of OsTCTP amino acids were not the potential N-glycosylation sites.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress. Thus, OsTCTP is a valuable gene for genetic engineering to improve rice performance under Hg contaminated paddy soils.
26057797	Functional characterization of heat-shock protein 90 from Oryza sativa and crystal structure of its N-terminal domain.	2015	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that is essential for the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells. It plays crucial roles in cell signalling, cell-cycle control and in maintaining proteome integrity and protein homeostasis. In plants, Hsp90s are required for normal plant growth and development. Hsp90s are observed to be upregulated in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses and are also involved in immune responses in plants. Although there are several studies elucidating the physiological role of Hsp90s in plants, their molecular mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, biochemical characterization of an Hsp90 protein from rice (Oryza sativa; OsHsp90) has been performed and the crystal structure of its N-terminal domain (OsHsp90-NTD) was determined. The binding of OsHsp90 to its substrate ATP and the inhibitor 17-AAG was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein also exhibited a weak ATPase activity. The crystal structure of OsHsp90-NTD was solved in complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP at 3.1 Å resolution. The domain was crystallized by cross-seeding with crystals of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 from Dictyostelium discoideum, which shares 70% sequence identity with OsHsp90-NTD. This is the second reported structure of a domain of Hsp90 from a plant source.
25970642	The Phosphate Transporter Gene OsPht1;4 Is Involved in Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	A total of 13 phosphate transporters in rice (Oryza sative) have been identified as belonging to the Pht1 family, which mediates inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake and transport. We report the biological property and physiological role of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4). Overexpressing OsPT4 resulted in significant higher Pi accumulation in roots, straw and brown rice, and suppression of OsPT4 caused decreased Pi concentration in straw and brown rice. Expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the OsPT4 promoter showed that OsPT4 is expressed in roots, leaves, ligules, stamens, and caryopses under sufficient Pi conditions, consistent with the expression profile showing that OsPT4 has high expression in roots and flag leaves. The transcript level of OsPT4 increased significantly both in shoots and roots with a long time Pi starvation. OsPT4 encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein and was able to complement the function of the Pi transporter gene PHO84 in yeast. We concluded that OsPT4 is a functional Pi-influx transporter involved in Pi absorption in rice that might play a role in Pi translocation. This study will enrich our understanding about the physiological function of rice Pht1 family genes.
26089154	Rice OsiSAP7 negatively regulates ABA stress signalling and imparts sensitivity to water-deficit stress in Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Sci	Stress associated protein (SAP) genes in plants regulate abiotic stress responses. SAP gene family consists of 18 members in rice. Although their abiotic stress responsiveness is well established, the mechanism of their action is poorly understood. OsiSAP7 was chosen to investigate the mechanism of its action based on the dual nature of its sub-cellular localization preferentially in the nucleus or sub-nuclear speckles upon transient expression in onion epidermal cells. Its expression was down-regulated in rice seedlings under abiotic stresses. OsiSAP7 was localized evenly in the nucleus under unstressed conditions and in sub-nuclear speckles on MG132 treatment. OsiSAP7 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Abiotic stress responses of OsiSAP7 were assessed by its overexpression in Arabidopsis under the control of a stress inducible promoter rd29A. Stress response assessment was done at seed germination and advanced stages of development. Transgenics were ABA insensitive at seed germination stage and sensitive to water-deficit stress at advanced stage as compared to wild type (WT). They were also impaired in ABA and stress-responsive gene expression. Our study suggests that OsiSAP7 acts as a negative regulator of ABA and water-deficit stress signalling by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase.
25957211	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	OsWRKY47 is a divergent rice transcription factor belonging to the group II of the WRKY family. A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants. A PCR-assisted site selection assay (SELEX) of recombinant OsWRKY47 protein showed that the preferred sequence bound in vitro is (G/T)TTGACT. Bioinformatics analyses identified a number of gene targets of OsWRKY47; among these two genes encode a Calmodulin binding protein and a Cys-rich secretory protein. Using Oswrk47 knockout mutants and transgenic rice overexpressing OsWRKY47 we show that the transcription of these putative targets were regulated by OsWRKY47. Phenotypic analysis carried out with transgenic rice plants showed that Oswrky47 mutants displayed higher sensitivity to drought and reduced yield, while plants overexpressing OsWRKY47 were more tolerant.
25983737	An auxin responsive CLE gene regulates shoot apical meristem development in Arabidopsis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Plant hormone auxin regulates most, if not all aspects of plant growth and development, including lateral root formation, organ pattering, apical dominance, and tropisms. Peptide hormones are peptides with hormone activities. Some of the functions of peptide hormones in regulating plant growth and development are similar to that of auxin, however, the relationship between auxin and peptide hormones remains largely unknown. Here we report the identification of OsCLE48, a rice (Oryza sativa) CLE (CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION) gene, as an auxin response gene, and the functional characterization of OsCLE48 in Arabidopsis and rice. OsCLE48 encodes a CLE peptide hormone that is similar to Arabidopsis CLEs. RT-PCR analysis showed that OsCLE48 was induced by exogenously application of IAA (indole-3-acetic acid), a naturally occurred auxin. Expression of integrated OsCLE48p:GUS reporter gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was also induced by exogenously IAA treatment. These results indicate that OsCLE48 is an auxin responsive gene. Histochemical staining showed that GUS activity was detected in all the tissue and organs of the OsCLE48p:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Expression of OsCLE48 under the control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis inhibited shoot apical meristem development. Expression of OsCLE48 under the control of the CLV3 native regulatory elements almost completely complemented clv3-2 mutant phenotypes, suggesting that OsCLE48 is functionally similar to CLV3. On the other hand, expression of OsCLE48 under the control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis has little, if any effects on root apical meristem development, and transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCLE48 are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type plants, suggesting that the functions of some CLE peptides may not be fully conserved in Arabidopsis and rice. Taken together, our results showed that OsCLE48 is an auxin responsive peptide hormone gene, and it regulates shoot apical meristem development when expressed in Arabidopsis.
26024762	The interaction between nitrogen availability and auxin, cytokinin, and strigolactone in the control of shoot branching in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Nitrogen availability and cytokinin could promote shoot branching in rice, whereas auxin and strigolactone inhibited it. The interaction between nitrogen availability and the three hormones is discussed. Rice shoot branching is strongly affected by nitrogen availability and the plant hormones auxin, cytokinin, and strigolactone; however, the interaction of them in the regulation of rice shoot branching remains a subject of debate. In the present study, nitrogen and the three hormones were used to regulate rice tiller bud growth in the indica rice variety Yangdao 6. Both nitrogen and CK promoted shoot branching in rice, whereas auxin and SL inhibited it. We used HPLC to determine the amounts of endogenous IAA and CK, and we used quantitative real-time PCR analysis to quantify the expression levels of several genes. Nitrogen enhanced the amount of CK by promoting the expression levels of OsIPTs in nodes. In addition, both nitrogen and CK downregulated the expression of genes related to SL synthesis in root and nodes, implying that the inhibition of SL synthesis by nitrogen may occur at least partially through the CK pathway. SL did not significantly reduce the amount of CK or the expression levels of OsIPT genes, but it did significantly reduce the amount of auxin and the auxin transport capacity in nodes. Auxin itself inhibited CK synthesis and promoted SL synthesis in nodes rather than in roots. Furthermore, we found that CK and SL quickly reduced and increased the expression of FC1 in buds, respectively, implying that FC1 might be a common target for the CK and SL pathways. Nitrogen and auxin delayed expression change patterns of FC1, potentially by changing the downstream signals for CK and SL.
26053497	Variation in NRT1.1B contributes to nitrate-use divergence between rice subspecies.	2015	Nat Genet	Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two main subspecies, indica and japonica. Indica has higher nitrate-absorption activity than japonica, but the molecular mechanisms underlying that activity remain elusive. Here we show that variation in a nitrate-transporter gene, NRT1.1B (OsNPF6.5), may contribute to this divergence in nitrate use. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NRT1.1B diverges between indica and japonica. NRT1.1B-indica variation was associated with enhanced nitrate uptake and root-to-shoot transport and upregulated expression of nitrate-responsive genes. The selection signature of NRT1.1B-indica suggests that nitrate-use divergence occurred during rice domestication. Notably, field tests with near-isogenic and transgenic lines confirmed that the japonica variety carrying the NRT1.1B-indica allele had significantly improved grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) compared to the variety without that allele. Our results show that variation in NRT1.1B largely explains nitrate-use divergence between indica and japonica and that NRT1.1B-indica can potentially improve the NUE of japonica.
26123916	Genetic mapping of a QTL controlling source-sink size and heading date in rice.	2015	Gene	Source size, sink size and heading date (HD) are three important classes of traits that determine the productivity of rice. In this study, a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between an elite indica line Big Grain1 (BG1) and a japonica line Xiaolijing (XLJ) were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for source-sink size and heading date. Totally, thirty-one QTLs for source size, twenty-two for sink size, four for heading date and seven QTL clusters which included QTLs for multiple traits were identified in three environmental trials. Thirty QTLs could be consistently detected in at least two trials and generally located in the clusters. Using a set of BC4F2 lines, the QTL cluster in C5-1-C5-2 on chromosome 5 was validated to be a major QTL pleiotropically affecting heading date, source size (flag leaf area) and panicle type (neck length of panicle, primary branching number and the ratio of secondary branching number to primary branching number), and was narrowed down to a 309.52Kb region. QTL clusters described above have a large effect on source-sink size and/or heading date, therefore they should be good resources to improve the adaptability and high yield potential of cultivars genetically.
26068669	Low temperature tolerance in plants: Changes at the protein level.	2015	Phytochemistry	Low temperature (LT) is one of several important environmental stresses influencing plant performance and distribution. Adaptation to LT is a highly dynamic stress-response phenomenon and involves complex cross-talk between different regulatory levels. Although plants differ in their sensitivity to LT, in temperate species low nonfreezing temperatures cause noticeable alterations in various biochemical and physiological processes that can potentially improve freezing tolerance. This adaptation is associated with changes in the expression pattern of genes and their protein products. Proteins are the major players in most cellular events and are directly involved in plant LT responses, thereby proteome analysis could help uncover additional novel proteins associated with LT tolerance. Proteomics is recommended as an appropriate strategy for complementing transcriptome level changes and characterizing translational and post-translational regulations. In this review, we considered alterations in the expression and accumulation of proteins in response to LT stress in the three major cereal crops produced worldwide (wheat, barley, and rice). LT stress down-regulates many photosynthesis-related proteins. On the contrary, pathways/protein sets that are up-regulated by LT include carbohydrate metabolism (ATP formation), ROS scavenging, redox adjustment, cell wall remodelling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, cryoprotection, defence/detoxification. These modifications are common adaptation reactions also observed in the plant model Arabidopsis, thus representing key potential biomarkers and critical intervention points for improving LT tolerance of crop plants in cold regions with short summers. We believe that an assessment of the proteome within a broad time frame and during the different phenological stages may disclose the molecular mechanisms related to the developmental regulation of LT tolerance and facilitate the progress of genetically engineered stress-resistant plant varieties.
26082171	Domesticated versus Wild Rice? Bring It Awn!	2015	Plant Cell	
26082172	LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the wild relative of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), flaunts long, barbed awns, which are necessary for efficient propagation and dissemination of seeds. By contrast, O. sativa cultivars have been selected to be awnless or to harbor short, barbless awns, which facilitate seed processing and storage. The transition from long, barbed awns to short, barbless awns was a crucial event in rice domestication. Here, we show that the presence of long, barbed awns in wild rice is controlled by a major gene on chromosome 4, LONG AND BARBED AWN1 (LABA1), which encodes a cytokinin-activating enzyme. A frame-shift deletion in LABA1 of cultivated rice reduces the cytokinin concentration in awn primordia, disrupting barb formation and awn elongation. Sequencing analysis demonstrated low nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep encompassing an ∼800-kb region around the derived laba1 allele in cultivated rice. Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication. Identification of LABA1 provides new insights into rice domestication and also sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development.
26121399	Overexpression of Rat Neurons Nitric Oxide Synthase in Rice Enhances Drought and Salt Tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to play an important role in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis mutants with lower or higher levels of endogenous NO. The exogenous application of NO donors or scavengers has also suggested an important role for NO in plant defense against environmental stress. In this study, rice plants under drought and high salinity conditions showed increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and NO levels. Overexpression of rat neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) in rice increased both NOS activity and NO accumulation, resulting in improved tolerance of the transgenic plants to both drought and salt stresses. nNOS-overexpressing plants exhibited stronger water-holding capability, higher proline accumulation, less lipid peroxidation and reduced electrolyte leakage under drought and salt conditions than wild rice. Moreover, nNOS-overexpressing plants accumulated less H2O2, due to the observed up-regulation of OsCATA, OsCATB and OsPOX1. In agreement, the activities of CAT and POX were higher in transgenic rice than wild type. Additionally, the expression of six tested stress-responsive genes including OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B, OsSNAC1, OsSNAC2, OsLEA3 and OsRD29A, in nNOS-overexpressing plants was higher than that in the wild type under drought and high salinity conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that nNOS overexpression suppresses the stress-enhanced electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 accumulation, and promotes proline accumulation and the expression of stress-responsive genes under stress conditions, thereby promoting increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses.
26046379	The potassium transporter OsHAK21 functions in the maintenance of ion homeostasis and tolerance to salt stress in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	The intracellular potassium (K(+) ) homeostasis, which is crucial for plant survival in saline environments, is modulated by K(+) channels and transporters. Some members of the high-affinity K(+) transporter (HAK) family are believed to function in the regulation of plant salt tolerance, but the physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a significant inducement of OsHAK21 expression by high-salinity treatment and provide genetic evidence of the involvement of OsHAK21 in rice salt tolerance. Disruption of OsHAK21 rendered plants sensitive to salt stress. Compared with the wild type, oshak21 accumulated less K(+) and considerably more Na(+) in both shoots and roots, and had a significantly lower K(+) net uptake rate but higher Na(+) uptake rate. Our analyses of subcellular localizations and expression patterns showed that OsHAK21 was localized in the plasma membrane and expressed in xylem parenchyma and individual endodermal cells (putative passage cells). Further functional characterizations of OsHAK21 in K(+) uptake-deficient yeast and Arabidopsis revealed that OsHAK21 possesses K(+) transporter activity. These results demonstrate that OsHAK21 may mediate K(+) absorption by the plasma membrane and play crucial roles in the maintenance of the Na(+) /K(+) homeostasis in rice under salt stress.
26070439	The expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, OsCesA7, is directly regulated by a rice transcription factor, OsMYB58/63.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: A rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, was found to directly upregulate the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 ( OsCesA7 ); in contrast, the Arabidopsis putative orthologs AtMYB58 and AtMYB63 have been shown to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. Although indirect evidence has shown that grass plants are similar to but partially different from dicotyledonous ones in transcriptional regulation of lignocellulose biosynthesis, little is known about the differences. This study showed that a rice MYB transcription factor, OsMYB58/63, directly upregulated the expression of a rice secondary wall-specific cellulose synthase gene, cellulose synthase A7 (OsCesA7). Gene co-expression analysis showed that, in rice, OsMYB58/63 and several rice MYB genes were co-expressed with genes encoding lignocellulose biosynthetic enzymes. The expression levels of OsMYB55/61, OsMYB55/61-L, OsMYB58/63, and OsMYB42/85 were commonly found to be high in culm internodes and nodes. All four MYB transcription factors functioned as transcriptional activators in yeast cells. OsMYB58/63 most strongly transactivated the expression of OsCesA7 in rice protoplasts. Moreover, recombinant OsMYB58/63 protein was bound to two distinct cis-regulatory elements, AC-II and SMRE3, in the OsCesA7 promoter. This is in sharp contrast to the role of Arabidopsis orthologs, AtMYB58 and AtMYB63, which had been reported to specifically activate lignin biosynthesis. The promoter analysis revealed that AC elements, which are the binding sites for MYB58 and MYB63, were lacking in cellulose and xylan biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis, but present in cellulose, xylan, and lignin biosynthetic genes in rice, implying that the difference of transcriptional regulation between rice and Arabidopsis is due to the distinct composition of promoters. Our results provide a new insight into transcriptional regulation in grass lignocellulose biosynthesis.
25974367	Characterization of a novel cyclase-like gene family involved in controlling stress tolerance in rice.	2015	J Plant Physiol	A novel cyclase-like gene family (CYL) encodes proteins containing cyclase domain, but their functions are largely unknown. We report the systematic identification and characterization of CYL genes in the rice genome. Five putative CYL protein sequences (OsCYL1 to 4b) were identified. These sequences and other CYL homologs were classified into four subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. Distinct diversification of these CYL proteins exists between plants and non-plants. The CYL family has conserved exon-intron structures, and the organizations of putative motifs in plants are specifically diverse. All OsCYL genes were expressed in a wide range of tissues or organs and were responsive to at least one of the abiotic stresses and hormone treatments applied. Protein OsCYL4a is targeted to the cell membrane. The overexpression of one stress-responsive gene OsCYL4a in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to salt, drought, cold, and oxidative stress. The expression levels of some abiotic stress-responsive factors, including H2O2-accumulating negative factors DST and OsSKIPa in OsCYL4a-overexpressing plants, were reduced compared with the wild type under normal condition and drought stress. These results suggest that rice CYL family may be functionally conserved polyketide cyclase, resulting in the rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species to decrease tolerance to abiotic stresses.
26067440	OsGRAS23, a rice GRAS transcription factor gene, is involved in drought stress response through regulating expression of stress-responsive genes.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Drought is a major abiotic stress factors that reduces agricultural productivity. GRAS transcription factors are plant-specific proteins that play diverse roles in plant development. However, the functions of a number of GRAS genes identified in rice are unknown, especially the GRAS genes related to rice drought resistance have not been characterized.

RESULTS: In this study, a novel GRAS transcription factor gene named OsGRAS23, which is located in a drought-resistant QTL interval on chromosome 4 of rice, was isolated. The expression of OsGRAS23 was induced by drought, NaCl, and jasmonic acid treatments. The OsGRAS23-GFP fused protein was localized in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells. A trans-activation assay in yeast cells demonstrated that the OsGRAS23 protein possessed a strong transcriptional activation activity. OsGRAS23-overexpressing rice plants showed improved drought resistance and oxidative stress tolerance as well as less H2O2 accumulation compared with the wild-type plants. Furthermore, microarray analysis showed that several anti-oxidation related genes were up-regulated in the OsGRAS23-overexpressing rice plants. The yeast one hybrid test indicated that OsGRAS23 could bind to the promoters of its potential target genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that OsGRAS23 encodes a stress-responsive GRAS transcription factor and positively modulates rice drought tolerance via the induction of a number of stress-responsive genes.
26040493	Single base substitution in OsCDC48 is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	A premature senescence and death 128 (psd128) mutant was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate-induced rice IR64 mutant bank. The premature senescence phenotype appeared at the six-leaf stage and the plant died at the early heading stage. psd128 exhibited impaired chloroplast development with significantly reduced photosynthetic ability, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, root vigor, soluble protein content and increased malonaldehyde content. Furthermore, the expression of senescence-related genes was significantly altered in psd128. The mutant trait was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using map-based strategy, the mutation Oryza sativa cell division cycle 48 (OsCDC48) was isolated and predicted to encode a putative AAA-type ATPase with 809 amino-acid residuals. A single base substitution at position C2347T in psd128 resulted in a premature stop codon. Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype. In addition, RNA interference resulted in the premature senescence and death phenotype. OsCDC48 was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle. Subcellular analysis indicated that OsCDC48:YFP fusion proteins were located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. OsCDC48 was highly conserved with more than 90% identity in the protein levels among plant species. Our results indicated that the impaired function of OsCDC48 was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype.
26083148	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	2015	New Phytol	WRKY proteins are transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of defense-related genes. The salicylic acid (SA)-inducible Oryza sativa WRKY6 (OsWRKY6) was identified as a positive regulator of Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related 10a (OsPR10a) by transient expression assays. A physical interaction between OsWRKY6 and W-box-like element 1 (WLE1), which positively regulates OsPR10a/probenazole induced protein 1 expression, was verified in vitro. Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) OsWRKY6 exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic OsWRKY6-RNAi lines, suggesting that OsWRKY6 is a positive regulator of defense responses. OsWRKY6-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased OsWRKY6 levels caused cell death. Salicylic acid (SA) concentrations were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in wild-type (WT) plants, and transcript levels of Oryza sativa isochorismate synthase 1 (OsICS1), which encodes a major enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis, were higher in OsWRKY6-ox lines than in WT. OsWRKY6 directly bound to the OsICS1 promoter in vivo. This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations. OsWRKY6 autoregulates its own expression. OsWRKY6 protein degradation is possibly regulated by ubiquitination. Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization.
26083975	Rice microRNA osa-miR1848 targets the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase gene OsCYP51G3 and mediates the biosynthesis of phytosterols and brassinosteroids during development and in response to stress.	2015	New Phytol	Phytosterols are membrane components or precursors for brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. As they cannot be transported long distances, their homeostasis is tightly controlled through their biosynthesis and metabolism. However, it is unknown whether microRNAs are involved in their homeostatic regulation. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants transformed with microRNA osa-miR1848 and its target, the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylase gene, OsCYP51G3, were used to investigate the role of osa-miR1848 in the regulation of phytosterol biosynthesis. osa-miR1848 directs OsCYP51G3 mRNA cleavage to regulate phytosterol and BR biosynthesis in rice. The role of OsCYP51G3 as one of the osa-miR1848 targets is supported by the opposite expression patterns of osa-miR1848 and OsCYP51G3 in transgenic rice plants, and by the identification of OsCYP51G3 mRNA cleavage sites. Increased osa-miR1848 and decreased OsCYP51G3 expression reduced phytosterol and BR concentrations, and caused typical phenotypic changes related to phytosterol and BR deficiency, including dwarf plants, erect leaves, semi-sterile pollen grains, and shorter cells. Circadian expression of osa-miR1848 regulated the diurnal abundance of OsCYP51G3 transcript in developing organs, and the response of OsCYP51G3 to salt stress. We propose that osa-miR1848 regulates OsCYP51G3 expression posttranscriptionally, and mediates phytosterol and BR biosynthesis. osa-miR1848 and OsCYP51G3 might have potential applications in rice breeding to modulate leaf angle, and the size and quality of seeds.
26096057	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	2015	Nat Commun	In plants, auxin signalling is initiated by the auxin-promoted interaction between the auxin receptor TIR1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, which are subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Gain-of-function mutations in the highly conserved domain II of Aux/IAAs abolish the TIR1-Aux/IAA interaction and thus cause an auxin-resistant phenotype. Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11. NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11. The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein. Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development. Together, these results illustrate cyclophilin-catalysed peptidyl-prolyl isomerization promotes Aux/IAA degradation, as a mechanism regulating auxin signalling.
26259181	Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Ferredoxins (Fds) are small iron-sulfur proteins that mediate electron transfer in a wide range of metabolic reactions. Besides Fds, there is a type of Fd-like proteins designated as FdC, which have conserved elements of Fds, but contain a significant C-terminal extension. So far, only two FdC genes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified in higher plants and thus the functions of FdC proteins remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a yellow-green leaf mutant, 501ys, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant exhibited yellow-green leaf phenotype and reduced chlorophyll level. The phenotype of 501ys was caused by mutation of a gene on rice chromosome 3. Map-based cloning of this mutant resulted in identification of OsFdC2 gene (LOC_Os03g48040) showing high identity with Arabidopsis FdC2 gene (AT1G32550). OsFdC2 was expressed most abundantly in leaves and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. In 501ys mutant, a missense mutation was detected in DNA sequence of the gene, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein. The mutant phenotype was rescued by introduction of the wild-type gene. Therefore, we successfully identified FdC2 gene via map-based cloning approach, and demonstrated that mutation of this gene caused yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.
26085678	A calcium-binding protein, rice annexin OsANN1, enhances heat stress tolerance by modulating the production of H2O2.	2015	J Exp Bot	OsANN1 is a member of the annexin protein family in rice. The function of this protein and the mechanisms of its involvement in stress responses and stress tolerance are largely unknown. Here it is reported that OsANN1 confers abiotic stress tolerance by modulating antioxidant accumulation under abiotic stress. OsANN1-knockdown [RNA interference (RNAi)] plants were more sensitive to heat and drought stresses, whereas OsANN1-overexpression (OE) lines showed improved growth with higher expression of OsANN1 under abiotic stress. Overexpression of OsANN1 promoted SOD (superoxide dismutase) and CAT (catalase) activities, which regulate H2O2 content and redox homeostasis, suggesting the existence of a feedback mechanism between OsANN1 and H2O2 production under abiotic stress. Higher expression of OsANN1 can provide overall cellular protection against abiotic stress-induced damage, and a significant accumulation of OsANN1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals was found in the cytosol after heat shock treatment. OsANN1 also has calcium-binding and ATPase activities in vitro, indicating that OsANN1 has multiple functions in rice growth. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that OsANN1 interacts with OsCDPK24. This cross-talk may provide additional layers of regulation in the abiotic stress response.
26098425	Expression of OsCAS (Calcium-Sensing Receptor) in an Arabidopsis Mutant Increases Drought Tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	The calcium-sensing receptor (CaS), which is localized in the chloroplasts, is a crucial regulator of extracellular calcium-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. It has homologs in Oryza sativa and other plants. These sequences all have a rhodanese-like protein domain, which has been demonstrated to be associated with specific stress conditions. In this study, we cloned the Oryza sativa calcium-sensing receptor gene (OsCAS) and demonstrated that OsCAS could sense an increase of extracellular Ca2+ concentration and mediate an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The OsCAS gene was transformed into an Arabidopsis CaS knockout mutant (Salk) and overexpressed in the transgenic plants. OsCAS promoted stomatal closure. We screened homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis plants and determined physiological indices such as the oxidative damage biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA), relative membrane permeability (RMP), proline content, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, after 21 days of drought treatment. Our results revealed lower RMP and MDA contents and a higher Proline content in transgenic Arabidopsis plants after drought stress, whereas the opposite was observed in Salk plants. With respect to chlorophyll fluorescence, the electron transport rate and effective PSII quantum yield decreased in all lines under drought stress; however, in the transgenic plants these two parameters changed fewer and were higher than those in wild-type and Salk plants. The quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation and nonregulated energy dissipation in PSII were higher in Salk plants, whereas these values were lower in the transgenic plants than in the wild type under drought stress. The above results suggest that the transgenic plants showed better resistance to drought stress by decreasing damage to the cell membrane, increasing the amount of osmoprotectants, and maintaining a relatively high photosynthetic capacity. In conclusion, OsCAS is an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor that helps to compensate for the absence of CaS in Arabidopsis and increases the drought stress tolerance of transgenic plants.
26082401	Integrative Comparison of the Role of the PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 Subfamily in Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient for all living cells, is indispensable for agricultural production. Although Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and its orthologs in other species have been shown to function in transcriptional regulation of phosphate (Pi) signaling and Pi homeostasis, an integrative comparison of PHR1-related proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) has not previously been reported. Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice (OsPHR1, OsPHR2, and OsPHR3) using phylogenetic and mutation analysis. OsPHR3 in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced genes. Loss-of-function mutations in any one of these transcription factors (TFs) impaired root hair growth (primarily root hair elongation). However, these three TFs showed differences in DNA binding affinities and messenger RNA expression patterns in different tissues and growth stages, and transcriptomic analysis revealed differential effects on Pi starvation-induced gene expression of single mutants of the three TFs, indicating some degree of functional diversification. Overexpression of genes encoding any of these TFs resulted in partial constitutive activation of Pi starvation response and led to Pi accumulation in the shoot. Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low-Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under Pi-deficient conditions. We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2, and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice.
26149652	Whole-genome expression analysis of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus in different plant hosts and small brown planthopper.	2015	Gene	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) can infect a number of gramineous plants and cause severe crop yield losses in southeast Asian countries. The virus is transmitted by small brown planthopper (SBPH) in a persistent circulative manner. The interactions between RBSDV and its different hosts remain unknown. Besides, how the virus adjusts itself to infect different hosts is unclear. In the present study, the relative RNA levels of the thirteen RBSDV genes in rice, maize, wheat, and SBPH were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. P7-1 and P10 genes were predominantly expressed whereas P8 and P7-2 genes were expressed at low levels in plant hosts. Similar to the expression in rice, P7-1 was the most abundantly expressed gene and P8 was expressed at the lowest level in SBPH, indicating that RBSDV adopts the same strategy to infect distinct hosts. The high expression levels of the P7-1 gene in both plants and insect suggest that it can be used as the target gene for disease diagnostics. However, the expression levels of some genes varied from host to host. P5-1, P6 and P9-1, the components of the RBSDV viroplasm, are differentially expressed in different hosts. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that the quantity of the P9-1 protein was more abundant in SBPH than in plant hosts. These data indicate that the virus may adjust its own gene expression to replicate in different hosts. Analysis of time course of gene expression revealed that P7-1 stands out as the only gene highly expressed at the earliest time point and its expression precedes all others throughout infection from 8 to 24days post-inoculation. The high expression levels of the P7-1 gene suggest that it plays a significant role in RBSDV-host interactions.
26200336	Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice.	2015	Nature	Atmospheric methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, and is responsible for about 20% of the global warming effect since pre-industrial times. Rice paddies are the largest anthropogenic methane source and produce 7-17% of atmospheric methane. Warm waterlogged soil and exuded nutrients from rice roots provide ideal conditions for methanogenesis in paddies with annual methane emissions of 25-100-million tonnes. This scenario will be exacerbated by an expansion in rice cultivation needed to meet the escalating demand for food in the coming decades. There is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies for increasing rice production while reducing methane fluxes from rice paddies. However, ongoing efforts for methane mitigation in rice paddies are mainly based on farming practices and measures that are difficult to implement. Despite proposed strategies to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions, no high-starch low-methane-emission rice has been developed. Here we show that the addition of a single transcription factor gene, barley SUSIBA2 (refs 7, 8), conferred a shift of carbon flux to SUSIBA2 rice, favouring the allocation of photosynthates to aboveground biomass over allocation to roots. The altered allocation resulted in an increased biomass and starch content in the seeds and stems, and suppressed methanogenesis, possibly through a reduction in root exudates. Three-year field trials in China demonstrated that the cultivation of SUSIBA2 rice was associated with a significant reduction in methane emissions and a decrease in rhizospheric methanogen levels. SUSIBA2 rice offers a sustainable means of providing increased starch content for food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation. Approaches to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions as seen in SUSIBA2 rice may be particularly beneficial in a future climate with rising temperatures resulting in increased methane emissions from paddies.
25869323	Identification and characterization of calcium transporter gene family in finger millet in relation to grain calcium content.	2015	Gene	Calcium (Ca) is an essential mineral for proper growth and development of plants as well as animals. In plants including cereals, calcium is deposited in seed during its development which is mediated by specialized Ca transporters. Common cereal seeds contain very low amounts of Ca while the finger millet (Eleusine coracana) contains exceptionally high amounts of Ca in seed. In order to understand the role of Ca transporters in grain Ca accumulation, developing seed transcriptome of two finger millet genotypes (GP-1, low Ca and GP-45 high Ca) differing in seed Ca content was sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and members of Ca transporter gene family were identified. Out of 109,218 and 120,130 contigs, 86 and 81 contigs encoding Ca transporters were identified in GP-1 and GP-45, respectively. After removal of redundant sequences, a total of 19 sequences were confirmed as Ca transporter genes, which includes 11 Ca(2+) ATPases, 07 Ca(2+)/cation exchangers and 01 Ca(2+) channel. The differential expressions of all genes were analyzed from transcriptome data and it was observed that 9 and 3 genes were highly expressed in GP-45 and GP-1 genotypes respectively. Validation of transcriptome expression data of selected Ca transporter genes was performed on different stages of developing spikes of both genotypes grown under different concentrations of exogenous Ca. In both genotypes, significant correlation was observed between the expression of these genes, especially EcCaX3, and on the amount of Ca accumulated in seed. The positive correlation of seed mass with the amount of Ca concentration was also observed. The efficient Ca transport property and responsiveness of EcCAX3 towards exogenous Ca could be utilized in future biofortification program.
26147619	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	2015	Nat Genet	Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with changes in gene expression levels and contribute to various adaptive traits. Here we show that a CNV at the Grain Length on Chromosome 7 (GL7) locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). GL7 encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana LONGIFOLIA proteins, which regulate longitudinal cell elongation. Tandem duplication of a 17.1-kb segment at the GL7 locus leads to upregulation of GL7 and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality. Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of GL7 and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the GL7 locus was selected for and used in breeding. Our work suggests that pyramiding beneficial alleles of GL7 and other yield- and quality-related genes may improve the breeding of elite rice varieties.
26147620	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	2015	Nat Genet	The deployment of heterosis in the form of hybrid rice varieties has boosted grain yield, but grain quality improvement still remains a challenge. Here we show that a quantitative trait locus for rice grain quality, qGW7, reflects allelic variation of GW7, a gene encoding a TONNEAU1-recruiting motif protein with similarity to C-terminal motifs of the human centrosomal protein CAP350. Upregulation of GW7 expression was correlated with the production of more slender grains, as a result of increased cell division in the longitudinal direction and decreased cell division in the transverse direction. OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression. The presence of a semidominant GW7(TFA) allele from tropical japonica rice was associated with higher grain quality without the yield penalty imposed by the Basmati gw8 allele. Manipulation of the OsSPL16-GW7 module thus represents a new strategy to simultaneously improve rice yield and grain quality.
26176923	Parent-progeny sequencing indicates higher mutation rates in heterozygotes.	2015	Nature	Mutation rates vary within genomes, but the causes of this remain unclear. As many prior inferences rely on methods that assume an absence of selection, potentially leading to artefactual results, we call mutation events directly using a parent-offspring sequencing strategy focusing on Arabidopsis and using rice and honey bee for replication. Here we show that mutation rates are higher in heterozygotes and in proximity to crossover events. A correlation between recombination rate and intraspecific diversity is in part owing to a higher mutation rate in domains of high recombination/diversity. Implicating diversity per se as a cause, we find an ∼3.5-fold higher mutation rate in heterozygotes than in homozygotes, with mutations occurring in closer proximity to heterozygous sites than expected by chance. In a genome that is a patchwork of heterozygous and homozygous domains, mutations occur disproportionately more often in the heterozygous domains. If segregating mutations predispose to a higher local mutation rate, clusters of genes dominantly under purifying selection (more commonly homozygous) and under balancing selection (more commonly heterozygous), might have low and high mutation rates, respectively. Our results are consistent with this, there being a ten times higher mutation rate in pathogen resistance genes, expected to be under positive or balancing selection. Consequently, we do not necessarily need to evoke extremely weak selection on the mutation rate to explain why mutational hot and cold spots might correspond to regions under positive/balancing and purifying selection, respectively.

26210810	The DnaJ OsDjA7/8 is essential for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Gene	DnaJ proteins belong to chaperones of Hsp40 family that ubiquitously participate in various cellular processes. Previous studies have shown chloroplast-targeted DnaJs are involved in the development of chloroplast in some plant species. However, little is known about the function of DnaJs in rice, one of the main staple crops. In this study, we characterized a type I DnaJ protein OsDjA7/8. We found that the gene OsDjA7/8 was expressed in all collected tissues, with a priority in the vigorous growth leaf. Subcellular localization revealed that the protein OsDjA7/8 was mainly distributed in chloroplast. Reduced expression of OsDjA7/8 in rice led to albino lethal at the seedling stage. Transmission electron microscopy observation showed that the chloroplast structures were abnormally developed in the plants silenced for OsDjA7/8. In addition, the transcriptional expression of the genes tightly associated with the development of chloroplast was deeply reduced in the plants silenced for OsDjA7/8. Collectively, our study reveals that OsDjA7/8 encodes a chloroplast-localized protein and is essential for chloroplast development and differentiation in rice.
26143051	Analysis of aliphatic waxes associated with root periderm or exodermis from eleven plant species.	2015	Phytochemistry	Aliphatic waxes can be found in association with suberized tissues, including roots. Non-polar lipids were isolated by rapid solvent extraction of mature regions of intact roots from eleven angiosperms, including both monocots and dicots. The majority of roots analyzed were taproots or tuberous taproots that had undergone secondary growth and thus were covered by a suberized periderm. The exceptions therein were maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.), which present a suberized exodermis. The analysis herein focused on aliphatic waxes, with particular emphasis on alkyl hydroxycinnamates (AHCs). AHCs were widely distributed, absent from only one species, were found in both aerial and subterranean portions of tuberous taproots, and were associated with the fibrous roots of both maize and rice. Most species also contained monoacylglycerols, fatty alcohols and/or free fatty acids. Carrot (Daucus carrota L.) was the outlier, containing only free fatty acids, sterols, and polyacetylenes as identified components. Sterols were the only ubiquitous component across all roots analyzed. Monoacylglycerols of ω-hydroxy fatty acids were present in maize and rice root waxes. For species within the Brassiceae, wax compositions varied between subspecies or varieties and between aerial and subterranean portions of taproots. In addition, reduced forms of photo-oxidation products of ω-hydroxy oleate and its corresponding dicarboxylic acid (10,18-dihydroxy-octadec-8-enoate, 9,18-dihydroxy-octadec-10-enoate and 9-hydroxyoctadec-10-ene-1,18-dioate) were identified as naturally occurring suberin monomers in rutabaga (Brassica napus subsp. rapifera Metzg.) periderm tissues.
26142104	Genome-wide analysis of the MYB gene family in physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.).	2015	Gene	The MYB proteins comprise one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, and play key roles in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism, and stress responses. A total of 125 MYB genes (JcMYB) have been identified in the physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) genome, including 120 2R-type MYB, 4 3R-MYB, and 1 4R-MYB genes. Based on exon-intron arrangement of MYBs from both lower (Physcomitrella patens) and higher (physic nut, Arabidopsis, and rice) plants, we can classify plant MYB genes into ten groups (MI-X), except for MIX genes which are nonexistent in higher plants. We also observed that MVIII genes may be one of the most ancient MYB types which consist of both R2R3- and 3R-MYB genes. Most MYB genes (76.8% in physic nut) belong to the MI group which can be divided into 34 subgroups. The JcMYB genes were nonrandomly distributed on its 11 linkage groups (LGs). The expansion of MYB genes across several subgroups was observed and resulted from genome triplication of ancient dicotyledons and from both ancient and recent tandem duplication events in the physic nut genome. The expression patterns of several MYB duplicates in the physic nut showed differences in four tissues (root, stem, leaf, and seed), and 34 MYB genes responded to at least one abiotic stressor (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation, and nitrogen starvation) in leaves and/or roots based on the data analysis of digital gene expression tags. Overexpression of the JcMYB001 gene in Arabidopsis increased its sensitivity to drought and salinity stresses.
26156223	The Genetic Basis of Composite Spike Form in Barley and 'Miracle-Wheat'.	2015	Genetics	Inflorescences of the tribe Triticeae, which includes wheat (Triticum sp. L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are characterized by sessile spikelets directly borne on the main axis, thus forming a branchless spike. 'Compositum-Barley' and tetraploid 'Miracle-Wheat' (T. turgidum convar. compositum (L.f.) Filat.) display noncanonical spike-branching in which spikelets are replaced by lateral branch-like structures resembling small-sized secondary spikes. As a result of this branch formation 'Miracle-Wheat' produces significantly more grains per spike, leading to higher spike yield. In this study, we first isolated the gene underlying spike-branching in 'Compositum-Barley,' i.e., compositum 2 (com2). Moreover, we found that COM2 is orthologous to the branched head(t) (bh(t)) locus regulating spike branching in tetraploid 'Miracle-Wheat.' Both genes possess orthologs with similar functions in maize BRANCHED SILKLESS 1 (BD1) and rice FRIZZY PANICLE/BRANCHED FLORETLESS 1 (FZP/BFL1) encoding AP2/ERF transcription factors. Sequence analysis of the bh(t) locus in a collection of mutant and wild-type tetraploid wheat accessions revealed that a single amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding domain gave rise to the domestication of 'Miracle-Wheat.' mRNA in situ hybridization, microarray experiments, and independent qRT-PCR validation analyses revealed that the branch repression pathway in barley is governed through the spike architecture gene Six-rowed spike 4 regulating COM2 expression, while HvIDS1 (barley ortholog of maize INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1) is a putative downstream target of COM2. These findings presented here provide new insights into the genetic basis of spike architecture in Triticeae, and have disclosed new targets for genetic manipulations aiming at boosting wheat's yield potential.

26150509	Conserved regulatory mechanism controls the development of cells with rooting functions in land plants.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Land plants develop filamentous cells-root hairs, rhizoids, and caulonemata-at the interface with the soil. Members of the group XI basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors encoded by LOTUS JAPONICUS ROOTHAIRLESS1-LIKE (LRL) genes positively regulate the development of root hairs in the angiosperms Lotus japonicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and rice (Oryza sativa). Here we show that auxin promotes rhizoid and caulonema development by positively regulating the expression of PpLRL1 and PpLRL2, the two LRL genes in the Physcomitrella patens genome. Although the group VIII bHLH proteins, AtROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6 and AtROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE1, promote root-hair development by positively regulating the expression of AtLRL3 in A. thaliana, LRL genes promote rhizoid development independently of PpROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE1 and PpROOT HAIR DEFECITVE SIX-LIKE2 (PpRSL1 and PpRSL2) gene function in P. patens. Together, these data demonstrate that both LRL and RSL genes are components of an ancient auxin-regulated gene network that controls the development of tip-growing cells with rooting functions among most extant land plants. Although this network has diverged in the moss and the angiosperm lineages, our data demonstrate that the core network acted in the last common ancestor of the mosses and angiosperms that existed sometime before 420 million years ago.

26193260	Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Metacaspases, a class of cysteine-dependent proteases like caspases in animals, are important regulators of programmed cell death (PCD) during development and stress responses in plants. The present study was focused on comprehensive analyses of expression patterns of the rice metacaspase (OsMC) genes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses and stress-related hormones. Results indicate that members of the OsMC family displayed differential expression patterns in response to abiotic (e.g., drought, salt, cold, and heat) and biotic (e.g., infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani) stresses and stress-related hormones such as abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene), although the responsiveness to these stresses or hormones varies to some extent. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that OsMC1 was solely localized and OsMC2 was mainly localized in the nucleus. Whereas OsMC3, OsMC4, and OsMC7 were evenly distributed in the cells, OsMC5, OsMC6, and OsMC8 were localized in cytoplasm. OsMC1 interacted with OsLSD1 and OsLSD3 while OsMC3 only interacted with OsLSD1 and that the zinc finger domain in OsMC1 is responsible for the interaction activity. The systematic expression and biochemical analyses of the OsMC family provide valuable information for further functional studies on the biological roles of OsMCs in PCD that is related to abiotic and biotic stress responses.
26172270	OsSIDP366, a DUF1644 gene, positively regulates responses to drought and salt stresses in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Domain of unknown function 1644 (DUF1644) is a highly conserved amino acid sequence motif present only in plants. Analysis of expression data of the family of DUF1644-containing genes indicated that they may regulate responses to abiotic stress in rice. Here we present our discovery of the role of OsSIDP366, a member of the DUF1644 gene family, in response to drought and salinity stresses in rice. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with downregulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments. The sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was not changed in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants, and OsSIDP366 expression was not affected in ABA-deficient mutants. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsSIDP366 is presented in the cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with protein markers for both processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) in rice protoplasts. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis indicated that stress-related genes such as SNAC1, OsHAK5 and PRs were upregulated in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice.
26191072	The molecular cloning and clarification of a photorespiratory mutant, oscdm1, using enhancer trapping.	2015	Front Genet	Enhancer trap systems have been demonstrated to increase the effectiveness of gene identification in rice. In this study, a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, named oscdm1, was screened and characterized in detail from a T-DNA enhancer-tagged population. The oscdm1 plants were different from other chlorophyll-deficient mutants; they produced chlorotic leaves at the third leaf stage, which gradually died with further growth of the plants. However, the oscdm1 plants were able to survive exposure to elevated CO2 levels, similar to photorespiratory mutants. An analysis of the T-DNA flanking sequence in the oscdm1 plants showed that the T-DNA was inserted into the promoter region of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) gene. OsSHMT1 is a key enzyme that is ubiquitous in nature and structurally conserved across kingdoms. The enzyme is responsible for the interconversion of serine and glycine and is essential for cellular one-carbon metabolism. Full-length OsSHMT1 complemented the oscdm1 phenotype, and the downregulation of OsSHMT1 in wild-type plants by RNA interference (RNAi) produced plants that mimicked the oscdm1 phenotype. GUS assays and quantitative PCR revealed the preferential expression of OsSHMT1 in young leaves. TEM revealed serious damage to the thylakoid membrane in oscdm1 chloroplasts. The oscdm1 plants showed more extensive damage than wild type using an IMAGING-PAM fluorometer, especially under high light intensities. OsSHMT1-GFP localized exclusively to mitochondria. Further analysis revealed that the H2O2 content in the oscdm1 plants was twice that in wild type at the fourth leaf stage. This suggests that the thylakoid membrane damage observed in the oscdm1 plants was caused by excessive H2O2. Interestingly, OsSHMT1-overexpressing plants exhibited increased photosynthetic efficiency and improved plant productivity. These results lay the foundation for further study of the OsSHMT1 gene and will help illuminate the functional role of OsSHMT1 in photorespiration in rice.
26205956	Physiological characteristics and related gene expression of after-ripening on seed dormancy release in rice.	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	After-ripening is a common method used for dormancy release in rice. In this study, the rice variety Jiucaiqing (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) was used to determine dormancy release following different after-ripening times (1, 2 and 3 months). Germination speed, germination percentage and seedling emergence increased with after-ripening; more than 95% germination and 85% seedling emergence were observed following 1 month of after-ripening within 10 days of imbibition, compared with <45% germination and 20% seedling emergence in freshly harvested seed. Hence, 3 months of after-ripening could be considered a suitable treatment period for rice dormancy release. Dormancy release by after-ripening is mainly correlated with a rapid decline in ABA content and increase in IAA content during imbibition. Subsequently, GA(1)/ABA, GA(7)/ABA, GA(12)/ABA, GA(20)/ABA and IAA/ABA ratios significantly increased, while GA(3)/ABA, GA(4)/ABA and GAs/IAA ratio significantly decreased in imbibed seeds following 3 months of after-ripening, thereby altering α-amylase activity during seed germination. Peak α-amylase activity occurred at an earlier germination stage in after-ripened seeds than in freshly harvested seeds. Expression of ABA, GA and IAA metabolism genes and dormancy-related genes was regulated by after-ripening time upon imbibition. Expression of OsCYP707A5, OsGA2ox1, OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, OsILR1, OsGH3-2, qLTG3-1 and OsVP1 increased, while expression of Sdr4 decreased in imbibed seeds following 3 months of after-ripening. Dormancy release through after-ripening might be involved in weakening tissues covering the embryo via qLTG3-1 and decreased ABA signalling and sensitivity via Sdr4 and OsVP1.
26188471	Comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 expression constructs for efficient targeted mutagenesis in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an efficient tool used for genome editing in a variety of organisms. Despite several recent reports of successful targeted mutagenesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in plants, in each case the target gene of interest, the Cas9 expression system and guide-RNA (gRNA) used, and the tissues used for transformation and subsequent mutagenesis differed, hence the reported frequencies of targeted mutagenesis cannot be compared directly. Here, we evaluated mutation frequency in rice using different Cas9 and/or gRNA expression cassettes under standardized experimental conditions. We introduced Cas9 and gRNA expression cassettes separately or sequentially into rice calli, and assessed the frequency of mutagenesis at the same endogenous targeted sequences. Mutation frequencies differed significantly depending on the Cas9 expression cassette used. In addition, a gRNA driven by the OsU6 promoter was superior to one driven by the OsU3 promoter. Using an all-in-one expression vector harboring the best combined Cas9/gRNA expression cassette resulted in a much improved frequency of targeted mutagenesis in rice calli, and bi-allelic mutant plants were produced in the T0 generation. The approach presented here could be adapted to optimize the construction of Cas9/gRNA cassettes for genome editing in a variety of plants.
26202491	BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.	2015	EMBO Rep	In the absence of pathogen attack, organisms usually suppress immune responses to reduce the negative effects of disease resistance. Monoubiquitination of histone variants at specific gene loci is crucial for gene expression, but its involvement in the regulation of plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we show that a rice SWI/SNF2 ATPase gene BRHIS1 is downregulated in response to the rice blast fungal pathogen or to the defense-priming-inducing compound BIT (1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2h)-one,1, 1-dioxide). The BRHIS1-containing complex represses the expression of some disease defense-related genes, including the pathogenesis-related gene OsPBZc and the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein kinase gene OsSIRK1. This is achieved through BRHIS1 recruitment to the promoter regions of target genes through specific interaction with monoubiquitinated histone variants H2B.7 and H2A.Xa/H2A.Xb/H2A.3, in the absence of pathogen attack or BIT treatment. Our results show that rice disease defense genes are initially organized in an expression-ready state by specific monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B variants deposited on their promoter regions, but are kept suppressed by the BRHIS1 complex, facilitating the prompt initiation of innate immune responses in response to infection through the stringent regulation of BRHIS1.
26148492	Multiple interval QTL mapping and searching for PSTOL1 homologs associated with root morphology, biomass accumulation and phosphorus content in maize seedlings under low-P.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Modifications in root morphology are important strategies to maximize soil exploitation under phosphorus starvation in plants. Here, we used two multiple interval models to map QTLs related to root traits, biomass accumulation and P content in a maize RIL population cultivated in nutrient solution. In addition, we searched for putative maize homologs to PSTOL1, a gene responsible to enhance early root growth, P uptake and grain yield in rice and sorghum.

RESULTS: Based on path analysis, root surface area was the root morphology component that most strongly contributed to total dry weight and to P content in maize seedling under low-P availability. Multiple interval mapping models for single (MIM) and multiple traits (MT-MIM) were combined and revealed 13 genomic regions significantly associated with the target traits in a complementary way. The phenotypic variances explained by all QTLs and their epistatic interactions using MT-MIM (23.4 to 35.5 %) were higher than in previous studies, and presented superior statistical power. Some of these QTLs were coincident with QTLs for root morphology traits and grain yield previously mapped, whereas others harbored ZmPSTOL candidate genes, which shared more than 55 % of amino acid sequence identity and a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain with OsPSTOL1. Additionally, four ZmPSTOL candidate genes co-localized with QTLs for root morphology, biomass accumulation and/or P content were preferentially expressed in roots of the parental lines that contributed the alleles enhancing the respective phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS: QTL mapping strategies adopted in this study revealed complementary results for single and multiple traits with high accuracy. Some QTLs, mainly the ones that were also associated with yield performance in other studies, can be good targets for marker-assisted selection to improve P-use efficiency in maize. Based on the co-localization with QTLs, the protein domain conservation and the coincidence of gene expression, we selected novel maize genes as putative homologs to PSTOL1 that will require further validation studies.
26220694	A putative 6-transmembrane nitrate transporter OsNRT1.1b plays a key role in rice under low nitrogen.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	OsNRT1.1a is a low-affinity nitrate (NO3 (-) ) transporter gene. In this study, another mRNA splicing product, OsNRT1.1b, putatively encoding a protein with six transmembrane domains, was identified based on the rice genomic database and bioinformatics analysis. OsNRT1.1a/OsNRT1.1b expression in Xenopus oocytes showed OsNRT1.1a-expressing oocytes accumulated (15) N levels to about half as compared to OsNRT1.1b-expressing oocytes. The electrophysiological recording of OsNRT1.1b-expressing oocytes treated with 0.25 mM NO3 (-) confirmed (15) N accumulation data. More functional assays were performed to examine the function of OsNRT1.1b in rice. The expression of both OsNRT1.1a and OsNRT1.1b was abundant in roots and downregulated by nitrogen (N) deficiency. The shoot biomass of transgenic rice plants with OsNRT1.1a or OsNRT1.1b overexpression increased under various N supplies under hydroponic conditions compared to wild-type (WT). The OsNRT1.1a overexpression lines showed increased plant N accumulation compared to the WT in 1.25 mM NH4 NO3 and 2.5 mM NO3 (-) or NH4 (+) treatments, but not in 0.125 mM NH4 NO3 . However, OsNRT1.1b overexpression lines increased total N accumulation in all N treatments, including 0.125 mM NH4 NO3 , suggesting that under low N condition, OsNRT1.1b would accumulate more N in plants and improve rice growth, but also that OsNRT1.1a had no such function in rice plants.
26143250	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 and HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation-Related Genes in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic gene transcription and is essential for normal plant development. However, the function of H2Bub1 in reproductive development remains elusive. Here, we report rice (Oryza sativa) HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 (OsHUB1) and OsHUB2, the homologs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HUB1 and HUB2 proteins, which function as E3 ligases in H2Bub1, are involved in late anther development in rice. oshub mutants exhibit abnormal tapetum development and aborted pollen in postmeiotic anthers. Knockout of OsHUB1 or OsHUB2 results in the loss of H2Bub1 and a reduction in the levels of dimethylated lysine-4 on histone 3 (H3K4me2). Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, rice Cysteine Protease1 (OsCP1), and Undeveloped Tapetum1 (UDT1) were down-regulated in the mutants. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that H2Bub1 directly targets OsC4, OsCP1, and UDT1 genes, and enrichment of H2Bub1 and H3K4me2 in the targets is consistent to some degree. Our studies suggest that histone H2B monoubiquitination, mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, is an important epigenetic modification that in concert with H3K4me2, modulates transcriptional regulation of anther development in rice.
26134707	Genome-wide investigation and expression analysis of Sodium/Calcium exchanger gene family in rice and Arabidopsis.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The Na(+)/Ca(2+) Exchanger (NCX) protein family is a member of the Cation/Ca(2+) exchanger superfamily and its members play important roles in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. While the functions of NCX family of proteins is well understood in humans, not much is known about the total complement of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers in plants and their role in various physiological and developmental processes. In the present study, we have identified all the NCX proteins encoded in the genomes of rice and Arabidopsis and studied their phylogeny, domain architecture and expression profiles across different tissues, at various developmental stages and under stress conditions.

RESULTS: Through whole genome investigation, we identified twenty-two NCX proteins encoded by fifteen genes in rice and sixteen NCX proteins encoded by thirteen genes in Arabidopsis. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction, these could be classified into five clades, members of most of which were found to possess distinct domain architecture. Expression profiling of the identified NCX genes using publicly available MPSS and microarray data showed differential expression patterns under abiotic stresses, and at various development stages. In rice, OsNCX1, OsNCX8, OsNCX9 and OsNCX15 were found to be highly expressed in all the plant parts and various developmental stages. qRT-PCR based expression analysis revealed that OsNCX3, OsNCX10 and OsNCX15 were highly induced by salt and dehydration stress. Besides, expression profiling showed differential regulation of rice NCX genes in response to calcium and EGTA. Interestingly, expression of none of the NCX genes was found to be co-regulated by NaCl and calcium.

CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results present insights into the potential role of NCX family of proteins in abiotic stresses and development. Findings of the present investigation should serve as a starting point for future studies aiming functional characterization of plant NCX family proteins.
26193322	Identification and Expression Analysis of PIN-Like (PILS) Gene Family of Rice Treated with Auxin and Cytokinin.	2015	Genes (Basel)	The phytohormone auxin is one of the most important signaling molecules that undergo accumulation or depletion in a temporal or spatial manner due to wide arrays of changes in developmental or stress programs. Proper distribution, maintenance and homeostasis of auxin molecules across the plant systems are one of the most important phenomena required for proper growth and development of plant. The distribution and homeostasis of auxin is maintained by auxin transport systems across the plant. The auxin transportation is carried out by auxin transporter family proteins, popularly known as auxin efflux carriers (PINs). In this study, a sub-family of auxin efflux carrier (OsPILS) genes was identified from Oryza sativa and relative expression profile was studied by treating them with auxin and cytokinin. Oryza sativa encodes seven putative sub-cellularly localized transmembrane OsPILS genes distributed in five chromosomes. Differential expression of OsPILS genes was found to be modulated by auxin and cytokinin treatment. In auxin treated plants, all OsPILS genes were up-regulated in leaves and down regulated in roots during the third week time period of developmental stages. In the cytokinin treated plants, the maximum of OsPILS genes were up-regulated during the third week time period in root and leaf tissue. Regulation of gene expression of OsPILS genes by auxin and cytokinin during the third week time period revealed its important role in plant growth and development.
26025521	Constitutive expression of DaCBF7, an Antarctic vascular plant Deschampsia antarctica CBF homolog, resulted in improved cold tolerance in transgenic rice plants.	2015	Plant Sci	Deschampsia antarctica is an Antarctic hairgrass that grows on the west coast of the Antarctic peninsula. In this report, we have identified and characterized a transcription factor, D. antarctica C-repeat binding factor 7 (DaCBF7), that is a member of the monocot group V CBF homologs. The protein contains a single AP2 domain, a putative nuclear localization signal, and the typical CBF signature. DaCBF7, like other monocot group V homologs, contains a distinct polypeptide stretch composed of 43 amino acids in front of the AP2 motif. DaCBF7 was predominantly localized to nuclei and interacted with the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element (CRT/DRE) core sequence (ACCGAC) in vitro. DaCBF7 was induced by abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, and salinity. To investigate its possible cellular role in cold tolerance, a transgenic rice system was employed. DaCBF7-overexpressing transgenic rice plants (Ubi:DaCBF7) exhibited markedly increased tolerance to cold stress compared to wild-type plants without growth defects; however, overexpression of DaCBF7 exerted little effect on tolerance to drought or salt stress. Transcriptome analysis of a Ubi:DaCBF7 transgenic line revealed 13 genes that were up-regulated in DaCBF7-overexpressing plants compared to wild-type plants in the absence of cold stress and in short- or long-term cold stress. Five of these genes, dehydrin, remorin, Os03g63870, Os11g34790, and Os10g22630, contained putative CRT/DRE or low-temperature responsive elements in their promoter regions. These results suggest that overexpression of DaCBF7 directly and indirectly induces diverse genes in transgenic rice plants and confers enhanced tolerance to cold stress.
26133169	Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Shoots and Roots of TNG67 and TCN1 Rice Seedlings under Cold Stress and Following Subsequent Recovery: Insights into Metabolic Pathways, Phytohormones, and Transcription Factors.	2015	PLoS One	Cold stress affects rice growth, quality and yield. The investigation of genome-wide gene expression is important for understanding cold stress tolerance in rice. We performed comparative transcriptome analysis of the shoots and roots of 2 rice seedlings (TNG67, cold-tolerant; and TCN1, cold-sensitive) in response to low temperatures and restoration of normal temperatures following cold exposure. TNG67 tolerated cold stress via rapid alterations in gene expression and the re-establishment of homeostasis, whereas the opposite was observed in TCN1, especially after subsequent recovery. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that cold stress substantially regulated the expression of genes involved in protein metabolism, modification, translation, stress responses, and cell death. TNG67 takes advantage of energy-saving and recycling resources to more efficiently synthesize metabolites compared with TCN1 during adjustment to cold stress. During recovery, expression of OsRR4 type-A response regulators was upregulated in TNG67 shoots, whereas that of genes involved in oxidative stress, chemical stimuli and carbohydrate metabolic processes was downregulated in TCN1. Expression of genes related to protein metabolism, modification, folding and defense responses was upregulated in TNG67 but not in TCN1 roots. In addition, abscisic acid (ABA)-, polyamine-, auxin- and jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes were preferentially regulated in TNG67 shoots and roots and were closely associated with cold stress tolerance. The TFs AP2/ERF were predominantly expressed in the shoots and roots of both TNG67 and TCN1. The TNG67-preferred TFs which express in shoot or root, such as OsIAA23, SNAC2, OsWRKY1v2, 24, 53, 71, HMGB, OsbHLH and OsMyb, may be good candidates for cold stress tolerance-related genes in rice. Our findings highlight important alterations in the expression of cold-tolerant genes, metabolic pathways, and hormone-related and TF-encoding genes in TNG67 rice during cold stress and recovery. The cross-talk of hormones may play an essential role in the ability of rice plants to cope with cold stress.
26140668	The auxin transporter, OsAUX1, is involved in primary root and root hair elongation and in Cd stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant J	Auxin and cadmium (Cd) stress play critical roles during root development. There are only a few reports on the mechanisms by which Cd stress influences auxin homeostasis and affects primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) development, and almost nothing is known about how auxin and Cd interfere with root hair (RH) development. Here, we characterize rice osaux1 mutants that have a longer PR and shorter RHs in hydroponic culture, and that are more sensitive to Cd stress compared to wild-type (Dongjin). OsAUX1 expression in root hair cells is different from that of its paralogous gene, AtAUX1, which is expressed in non-hair cells. However, OsAUX1, like AtAUX1, localizes at the plasma membrane and appears to function as an auxin tranporter. Decreased auxin distribution and contents in the osaux1 mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PRs, LRs and RHs under Cd stress, but may be rescued by treatment with the membrane-permeable auxin 1-naphthalene acetic acid. Treatment with the auxin transport inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acid and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid increased the Cd sensitivity of WT rice. Cd contents in the osaux1 mutant were not altered, but reactive oxygen species-mediated damage was enhanced, further increasing the sensitivity of the osaux1 mutant to Cd stress. Taken together, our results indicate that OsAUX1 plays an important role in root development and in responses to Cd stress.
26025522	The rice RCN11 gene encodes β1,2-xylosyltransferase and is required for plant responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormones.	2015	Plant Sci	Seed germination rates and plant development and growth under abiotic stress are important aspects of crop productivity. Here, our characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant reduced culm number11 (rcn11) showed that RCN11 controls growth of plants exposed to abnormal temperature, salinity and drought conditions. RCN11 also mediates root aerenchyma formation under oxygen-deficient conditions and ABA sensitivity during seed germination. Molecular studies showed that the rcn11 mutation resulted from a 966-bp deletion that caused loss of function of β1,2-xylosyltransferase (OsXylT). This enzyme is located in the Golgi apparatus where it catalyzes the transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose to the core β-linked mannose of N-glycans. RCN11/OsXylT promoter activity was observed in the basal part of the shoot containing the shoot and axillary meristems and in the base of crown roots. The level of RCN11/OsXylT expression was regulated by multiple phytohormones and various abiotic stresses suggesting that plant specific N-glycosylation is regulated by multiple signals in rice plants. The present study is the first to demonstrate that rice β1,2-linked xylose residues on N-glycans are critical for seed germination and plant development and growth under conditions of abiotic stress.
26121094	OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.	2015	Plant J	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces all of the plant's aerial organs. The SAM is established either during embryogenesis or experimentally in in vitro tissue culture. Although several factors including the Class I KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOXI) proteins, auxin, and cytokinin are known to play essential roles in SAM development, the underlying mechanisms of SAM formation and maintenance are still largely not understood. Herein we demonstrate that OsARID3, a member of the rice (Oryza sativa) AT-rich Interaction Domain (ARID) family, is required for SAM development. Disruption of OsARID3 leads to a defective SAM, early seedling lethality, and impaired capacity of in vitro shoot regeneration. We show that the expression levels of several KNOXI genes and the biosynthetic genes for auxin and cytokinin are significantly altered in the Osarid3 mutant calli. Moreover, we determine that auxin concentrations are increased, whereas cytokinin levels are decreased, in Osarid3 calli. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7. We also show through electrophoretic mobility shift assays that OsARID3 specifically binds to the AT-rich DNA sequences of the identified target genes. We conclude that OsARID3 is an AT-rich specific DNA-binding protein and that it plays a major role in SAM development in rice.
26187814	A Rare Allele of GS2 Enhances Grain Size and Grain Yield in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant	Grain size determines grain weight and affects grain quality. Several major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulating grain size have been cloned; however, our understanding of the underlying mechanism that regulates the size of rice grains remains fragmentary. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, grain size on chromosome 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator. GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator. A rare mutation of GS2 affecting the binding site of a microRNA, OsmiR396c, causes elevated expression of GS2/OsGRF4. The increase in GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield. The introduction of this rare allele of GS2/OsGRF4 into rice cultivars could significantly enhance grain weight and increase grain yield, with possible applications in breeding high-yield rice varieties.
26220952	A Novel Gene, OZONE-RESPONSIVE APOPLASTIC PROTEIN1, Enhances Cell Death in Ozone Stress in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	A novel protein, OZONE-RESPONSIVE APOPLASTIC PROTEIN1 (OsORAP1), was characterized, which was previously suggested as a candidate gene underlying OzT9, a quantitative trait locus for ozone stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). The sequence of OsORAP1 was similar to that of ASCORBATE OXIDASE (AO) proteins. It was localized in the apoplast, as shown by transient expression of an OsORAP1/green fluorescent protein fusion construct in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells, but did not possess AO activity, as shown by heterologous expression of OsORAP1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants with reduced background AO activity. A knockout rice line of OsORAP1 showed enhanced tolerance to ozone stress (120 nL L(-1) average daytime concentration, 20 d), as demonstrated by less formation of leaf visible symptoms (i.e. cell death), less lipid peroxidation, and lower NADPH oxidase activity, indicating reduced active production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, the effect of ozone on chlorophyll content was not significantly different among the lines. These observations suggested that OsORAP1 specifically induced cell death in ozone stress. Significantly enhanced expression of jasmonic acid-responsive genes in the knockout line implied the involvement of the jasmonic acid pathway in symptom mitigation. Sequence analysis revealed extensive polymorphisms in the promoter region of OsORAP1 between the ozone-susceptible cv Nipponbare and the ozone-tolerant cv Kasalath, the OzT9 donor variety, which could be responsible for the differential regulation of OsORAP1 reported earlier. These pieces of evidence suggested that OsORAP1 enhanced cell death in ozone stress, and its expression levels could explain the effect of a previously reported quantitative trait locus.
26129988	Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis and its implications for stress tolerance and plant development were investigated in a set of rice knock-out (KO) mutants for AsA biosynthetic genes and their wild-types. KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30%, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80%, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels. AsA concentration was negatively correlated with lipid peroxidation in foliar tissue under ozone stress and zinc deficiency, but did not affect the sensitivity to iron toxicity. Lack of AsA reduced the photosynthetic efficiency as represented by the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vmax), the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter ΦPSII. Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80% reductions). All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages. In conclusion, our data demonstrate multiple roles of AsA in stress tolerance and development of rice.
26165755	OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.	2015	Sci Rep	RNAi is a major antiviral defense response in plant and animal model systems. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) is an essential component of RNAi, which plays an important role in the resistance against viruses in the model plants. We found previously that rice RDR6 (OsRDR6) functioned in the defense against Rice stripe virus (RSV), and Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus (RDV) infection resulted in down-regulation of expression of RDR6. Here we report our new findings on the function of OsRDR6 against RDV. Our result showed that down-regulation of OsRDR6 through the antisense (OsRDR6AS) strategy increased rice susceptibility to RDV infection while over-expression of OsRDR6 had no effect on RDV infection. The accumulation of RDV vsiRNAs was reduced in the OsRDR6AS plants. In the OsRDR6 over-expressed plants, the levels of OsRDR6 RNA transcript and protein were much higher than that in the control plants. Interestingly, the accumulation level of OsRDR6 protein became undetectable after RDV infection. This finding indicated that the translation and/or stability of OsRDR6 protein were negatively impacted upon RDV infection. This new finding provides a new light on the function of RDR6 in plant defense response and the cross-talking between factors encoded by host plant and double-stranded RNA viruses.
26025528	The R2R3-type MYB gene OsMYB91 has a function in coordinating plant growth and salt stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Plants have evolved a number of different mechanisms to respond and to adapt to abiotic stress for their survival. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in coordinating abiotic stress tolerance and plant growth are not fully understood. Here, the function of OsMYB91, an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice was explored. OsMYB91 was induced by abiotic stress, especially by salt stress. Analysis of chromatin structure of the gene revealed that salt stress led to rapid removal of DNA methylation from the promoter region and rapid changes of histone modifications in the locus. Plants over-expressing OsMYB91 showed reduced plant growth and accumulation of endogenous ABA under control conditions. Under salt stress, the over-expression plants showed enhanced tolerance with significant increases of proline levels and a highly enhanced capacity to scavenge active oxygen as well as the increased induction of OsP5CS1 and LOC_Os03g44130 compared to wild type, while RNAi plants were less sensitive. In addition, expression of OsMYB91 was also induced by other abiotic stresses and hormone treatment. More interestingly, SLR1, the rice homolog of Arabidopsis DELLA genes that have been shown to integrate endogenous developmental signals with adverse environmental conditions, was highly induced by OsMYB91 over-expression, while the salt-induction of SLR1 expression was impaired in the RNAi plants. These results suggested that OsMYB91 was a stress-responsive gene that might be involved in coordinating rice tolerance to abiotic stress and plant growth by regulating SLR1 expression.
26150107	Two short sequences in OsNAR2.1 promoter are necessary for fully activating the nitrate induced gene expression in rice roots.	2015	Sci Rep	Nitrate is an essential nitrogen source and serves as a signal to control growth and gene expression in plants. In rice, OsNAR2.1 is an essential partner of multiple OsNRT2 nitrate transporters for nitrate uptake over low and high concentration range. Previously, we have reported that -311 bp upstream fragment from the translational start site in the promoter of OsNAR2.1 gene is the nitrate responsive region. To identify the cis-acting DNA elements necessary for nitrate induced gene expression, we detected the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter in the transgenic rice driven by the OsNAR2.1 promoter with different lengths and site mutations of the 311 bp region. We found that -129 to -1 bp region is necessary for the nitrate-induced full activation of OsNAR2.1. Besides, the site mutations showed that the 20 bp fragment between -191 and -172 bp contains an enhancer binding site necessary to fully drive the OsNAR2.1 expression. Part of the 20 bp fragment is commonly presented in the sequences of different promoters of both the nitrate induced NAR2 genes and nitrite reductase NIR1 genes from various higher plants. These findings thus reveal the presence of conserved cis-acting element for mediating nitrate responses in plants.
26251883	New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Molecular links between receptor-kinases and Rac/ROP family small GTPases mediated by activator guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) govern diverse biological processes. However, it is unclear how the Rac/ROP GTPases orchestrate such a wide variety of activities. Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER. This complex is transported from ER to the PM and there associates with OsRac1, resulting in the formation of a stable immune complex. Such RLK-GEF heterodimer complexes may explain the diversity of Rac/ROP family GTPase signalings.
26126957	Expression of a rice glutaredoxin in aleurone layers of developing and mature seeds: subcellular localization and possible functions in antioxidant defense.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: A rice glutaredoxin isoform (OsGrxC2;2) with antioxidant capacity is expressed abundantly in seed tissues and is localized to storage vacuoles in aleurone layers in developing and mature seeds. Seed tissues undergo drastic water loss at the late stage of seed development, and thus need to tolerate oxidative injuries associated with desiccation. We previously found a rice glutaredoxin isoform, OsGrxC2;2, as a gene expressed abundantly in developing seeds. Since glutaredoxin is involved in antioxidant defense, in the present study we investigated the subcellular localization and expression profile of OsGrxC2;2 and whether OsGrxC2;2 has a role in the defense against reactive oxygen species. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that the OsGrxC2;2 protein accumulated at a high level in the embryo and aleurone layers of developing and mature seeds. The OsGrxC2;2 in developing seeds was particularly localized to aleurone grains, which are storage organelles derived from vacuoles. Overexpression of OsGrxC2;2 resulted in an enhanced tolerance to menadione in yeast and methyl viologen in green leaves of transgenic rice plants. These results suggest that OsGrxC2;2 participates in the defense against oxidative stress in developing and mature seeds.
26230579	Analysis of Stress-Responsive Gene Expression in Cultivated and Weedy Rice Differing in Cold Stress Tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars show impairment of growth in response to environmental stresses such as cold at the early seedling stage. Locally adapted weedy rice is able to survive under adverse environmental conditions, and can emerge in fields from greater soil depth. Cold-tolerant weedy rice can be a good genetic source for developing cold-tolerant, weed-competitive rice cultivars. An in-depth analysis is presented here of diverse indica and japonica rice genotypes, mostly weedy rice, for cold stress response to provide an understanding of different stress adaptive mechanisms towards improvement of the rice crop performance in the field. We have tested a collection of weedy rice genotypes to: 1) classify the subspecies (ssp.) grouping (japonica or indica) of 21 accessions; 2) evaluate their sensitivity to cold stress; and 3) analyze the expression of stress-responsive genes under cold stress and a combination of cold and depth stress. Seeds were germinated at 25°C at 1.5- and 10-cm sowing depth for 10d. Seedlings were then exposed to cold stress at 10°C for 6, 24 and 96h, and the expression of cold-, anoxia-, and submergence-inducible genes was analyzed. Control plants were seeded at 1.5cm depth and kept at 25°C. The analysis revealed that cold stress signaling in indica genotypes is more complex than that of japonica as it operates via both the CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways, implicated through induction of transcription factors including OsNAC2, OsMYB46 and OsF-BOX28. When plants were exposed to cold + sowing depth stress, a complex signaling network was induced that involved cross talk between stresses mediated by CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways to circumvent the detrimental effects of stresses. The experiments revealed the importance of the CBF regulon for tolerance to both stresses in japonica and indica ssp. The mechanisms for cold tolerance differed among weedy indica genotypes and also between weedy indica and cultivated japonica ssp. as indicated by the up/downregulation of various stress-responsive pathways identified from gene expression analysis. The cold-stress response is described in relation to the stress signaling pathways, showing complex adaptive mechanisms in different genotypes.
26296966	The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	The photoperiodic response is one of the most important factors determining heading date in rice (Oryza sativa). Although rhythmic expression patterns of flowering time genes have been reported to fine-tune the photoperiodic response, posttranslational regulation of key flowering regulators has seldom been elucidated in rice. Heading date 1 (Hd1) encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the photoperiodic response, which determines rice regional adaptability. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Hd1 accumulation during the photoperiod response. Here, we identify a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, Heading date Associated Factor 1 (HAF1), which physically interacts with Hd1. HAF1 mediates ubiquitination and targets Hd1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. The haf1 mutant exhibits a later flowering heading date under both short-day and long-day conditions. In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions. Moreover, high levels of Hd1 accumulate in haf1. Our results suggest that HAF1 is essential to precise modulation of the timing of Hd1 accumulation during the photoperiod response in rice.
26275424	Natural Variation in the Flag Leaf Morphology of Rice Due to a Mutation of the NARROW LEAF 1 Gene in Oryza sativa L.	2015	Genetics	We investigated the natural variations in the flag leaf morphology of rice. We conducted a principal component analysis based on nine flag leaf morphology traits using 103 accessions from the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences Core Collection. The first component explained 39% of total variance, and the variable with highest loading was the width of the flag leaf (WFL). A genome-wide association analysis of 102 diverse Japanese accessions revealed that marker RM6992 on chromosome 4 was highly associated with WFL. In analyses of progenies derived from a cross between Takanari and Akenohoshi, the most significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for WFL was in a 10.3-kb region containing the NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1) gene, located 0.4 Mb downstream of RM6992. Analyses of chromosomal segment substitution lines indicated that a mutation (G1509A single-nucleotide mutation, causing an R233H amino acid substitution in NAL1) was present at the QTL. This explained 13 and 20% of total variability in WFL and the distance between small vascular bundles, respectively. The mutation apparently occurred during rice domestication and spread into japonica, tropical japonica, and indica subgroups. Notably, one accession, Phulba, had a NAL1 allele encoding only the N-terminal, or one-fourth, of the wild-type peptide. Given that the Phulba allele and the histidine-type allele showed essentially the same phenotype, the histidine-type allele was regarded as malfunctional. The phenotypes of transgenic plants varied depending on the ratio of histidine-type alleles to arginine-type alleles, raising the possibility that H(233)-type products function differently from and compete with R(233)-type products.
26283354	Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Grain size is one of the key factors determining grain yield. However, it remains largely unknown how grain size is regulated by developmental signals. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a dominant mutant big grain1 (Bg1-D) that shows an extra-large grain phenotype from our rice T-DNA insertion population. Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism. In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains. Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport. Consistent with this finding, the mutant has increased auxin basipetal transport and altered auxin distribution, whereas the knockdown plants have decreased auxin transport. Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield. Taking these data together, we identify a novel positive regulator of auxin response and transport in a crop plant and demonstrate its role in regulating grain size, thus illuminating a new strategy to improve plant productivity.
26286535	Characteristics of Plant Essential Genes Allow for within- and between-Species Prediction of Lethal Mutant Phenotypes.	2015	Plant Cell	Essential genes represent critical cellular components whose disruption results in lethality. Characteristics shared among essential genes have been uncovered in fungal and metazoan model systems. However, features associated with plant essential genes are largely unknown and the full set of essential genes remains to be discovered in any plant species. Here, we show that essential genes in Arabidopsis thaliana have distinct features useful for constructing within- and cross-species prediction models. Essential genes in A. thaliana are often single copy or derived from older duplications, highly and broadly expressed, slow evolving, and highly connected within molecular networks compared with genes with nonlethal mutant phenotypes. These gene features allowed the application of machine learning methods that predicted known lethal genes as well as an additional 1970 likely essential genes without documented phenotypes. Prediction models from A. thaliana could also be applied to predict Oryza sativa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae essential genes. Importantly, successful predictions drew upon many features, while any single feature was not sufficient. Our findings show that essential genes can be distinguished from genes with nonlethal phenotypes using features that are similar across kingdoms and indicate the possibility for translational application of our approach to species without extensive functional genomic and phenomic resources.
26283388	Orchestration of three transporters and distinct vascular structures in node for intervascular transfer of silicon in rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Requirement of mineral elements in different plant tissues is not often consistent with their transpiration rate; therefore, plants have developed systems for preferential distribution of mineral elements to the developing tissues with low transpiration. Here we took silicon (Si) as an example and revealed an efficient system for preferential distribution of Si in the node of rice (Oryza sativa). Rice is able to accumulate more than 10% Si of the dry weight in the husk, which is required for protecting the grains from water loss and pathogen infection. However, it has been unknown for a long time how this hyperaccumulation is achieved. We found that three transporters (Lsi2, Lsi3, and Lsi6) located at the node are involved in the intervascular transfer, which is required for the preferential distribution of Si. Lsi2 was polarly localized to the bundle sheath cell layer around the enlarged vascular bundles, which is next to the xylem transfer cell layer where Lsi6 is localized. Lsi3 was located in the parenchyma tissues between enlarged vascular bundles and diffuse vascular bundles. Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf. Furthermore, we constructed a mathematical model for Si distribution and revealed that in addition to cooperation of three transporters, an apoplastic barrier localized at the bundle sheath cells and development of the enlarged vascular bundles in node are also required for the hyperaccumulation of Si in rice husk.
26290940	Eukaryotic Catalase-Peroxidase: The Role of the Trp-Tyr-Met Adduct in Protein Stability, Substrate Accessibility, and Catalysis of Hydrogen Peroxide Dismutation.	2015	Biochemistry	Recently, it was demonstrated that bifunctional catalase-peroxidases (KatGs) are found not only in archaea and bacteria but also in lower eukaryotes. Structural studies and preliminary biochemical data of the secreted KatG from the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (MagKatG2) suggested both similar and novel features when compared to those of the prokaryotic counterparts studied so far. In this work, we demonstrate the role of the autocatalytically formed redox-active Trp140-Tyr273-Met299 adduct of MagKatG2 in (i) the maintenance of the active site architecture, (ii) the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide dismutation, and (iii) the protein stability by comparing wild-type MagKatG2 with the single mutants Trp140Phe, Tyr273Phe, and Met299Ala. The impact of disruption of the covalent bonds between the adduct residues on the spectral signatures and heme cavity architecture was small. By contrast, loss of its integrity converts bifunctional MagKatG2 to a monofunctional peroxidase of significantly reduced thermal stability. It increases the accessibility of ligands due to the increased flexibility of the KatG-typical large loop 1 (LL1), which contributes to the substrate access channel and anchors at the adduct Tyr. We discuss these data with respect to those known from prokaryotic KatGs and in addition present a high-resolution structure of an oxoiron compound of MagKatG2.
26307379	The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and WOX11 Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling.	2015	Plant Cell	Crown roots are the main components of the fibrous root system in rice (Oryza sativa). WOX11, a WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene specifically expressed in the emerging crown root meristem, is a key regulator in crown root development. However, the nature of WOX11 function in crown root development has remained elusive. Here, we identified a rice AP2/ERF protein, ERF3, which interacts with WOX11 and was expressed in crown root initials and during crown root growth. Functional analysis revealed that ERF3 was essential for crown root development and acts in auxin- and cytokinin-responsive gene expression. Downregulation of ERF3 in wox11 mutants produced a more severe root phenotype. Also, increased expression of ERF3 could partially complement wox11, indicating that the two genes functioned cooperatively to regulate crown root development. ERF3 and WOX11 shared a common target, the cytokinin-responsive gene RR2. The expression of ERF3 and WOX11 only partially overlapped, underlining a spatio-temporal control of RR2 expression and crown root development. Furthermore, ERF3-regulated RR2 expression was involved in crown root initiation, while the ERF3/WOX11 interaction likely repressed RR2 during crown root elongation. These results define a mechanism regulating gene expression involved in cytokinin signaling during different stages of crown root development in rice.
26287768	The elicitor-responsive gene for a GRAS family protein, CIGR2, suppresses cell death in rice inoculated with rice blast fungus via activation of a heat shock transcription factor, OsHsf23.	2015	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We show that a rice GRAS family protein, CIGR2, is a bonafide transcriptional activator, and through this function, targets the B-type heat shock protein-encoding gene OsHsf23 (Os09g0456800). CIGR2 (Os07g0583600) is an N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor-responsive gene whose activity, through the direct transcriptional control of OsHsf23, is required for mediating hypersensitive cell death activation during pathogen infection. RNAi lines of CIGR2 and OsHsf23 similarly exhibited the higher level of granulation in the epidermal cells of leaf sheath inoculated with an avirulent isolate of rice blast fungus. Interestingly, we did not observe altered levels of resistance, suggesting that CIGR2 suppresses excessive cell death in the incompatible interaction with blast fungus via activation of OsHsf23.
26275661	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	WRKY transcription factors have been implicated in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming associated with various plant processes but most notably with plant defense responses to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that expression of rice WRKY4 gene (OsWRKY4) was rapidly and strongly induced upon infection of Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight, and exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET). OsWRKY4 is localized to the nucleus of plant cells and possesses transcriptional activation ability. Modulation of OsWRKY4 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to the necrotrophic sheath blight fungus, concomitant with elevated expression of JA- and ET-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR1b, PR5 and PR10/PBZ1. Suppression by RNA interference (RNAi), on the other hand, compromises resistance to the fungal pathogen. Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements. In conclusion, we propose that OsWRKY4 functions as an important positive regulator that is implicated in the defense responses to rice sheath blight via JA/ET-dependent signal pathway.
26300907	Functional characterization and reconstitution of ABA signaling components using transient gene expression in rice protoplasts.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The core components of ABA-dependent gene expression signaling have been identified in Arabidopsis and rice. This signaling pathway consists of four major components; group A OsbZIPs, SAPKs, subclass A OsPP2Cs and OsPYL/RCARs in rice. These might be able to make thousands of combinations through interaction networks resulting in diverse signaling responses. We tried to characterize those gene functions using transient gene expression for rice protoplasts (TGERP) because it is instantaneous and convenient system. Firstly, in order to monitor the ABA signaling output, we developed reporter system named pRab16A-fLUC which consists of Rab16A promoter of rice and luciferase gene. It responses more rapidly and sensitively to ABA than pABRC3-fLUC that consists of ABRC3 of HVA1 promoter in TGERP. We screened the reporter responses for over-expression of each signaling components from group A OsbZIPs to OsPYL/RCARs with or without ABA in TGERP. OsbZIP46 induced reporter most strongly among OsbZIPs tested in the presence of ABA. SAPKs could activate the OsbZIP46 even in the ABA independence. Subclass A OsPP2C6 and -8 almost completely inhibited the OsbZIP46 activity in the different degree through the SAPK9. Lastly, OsPYL/RCAR2 and -5 rescued the OsbZIP46 activity in the presence of SAPK9 and OsPP2C6 dependent on ABA concentration and expression level. By using TGERP, we could characterize successfully the effects of ABA dependent gene expression signaling components in rice. In conclusion, TGERP represents very useful technology to study systemic functional genomics in rice or other monocots.
26318143	Different responses of low grain-Cd-accumulating and high grain-Cd-accumulating rice cultivars to Cd stress.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal pollutant which is highly toxic to plants and animals. The accumulation of Cd in rice grains is a major agricultural problem in regions with Cd pollution. A hydroponics experiment using low grain-Cd-accumulating rice (xiushui 11) and high grain-Cd-accumulating rice (xiushui 110) was carried out to characterize the different responses of rice cultivars to Cd stress. We found that xiushui 11 was more tolerant to Cd than xiushui 110, and xiushui 11 suffered less oxidative damage. Cell walls played an important role in limiting the amount of Cd that entered the protoplast, especially in xiushui 11. Cd stored in organelles as soluble fractions, leading to greater physiological stress of Cd detoxification. We found that Cd can disturb the ion homeostasis in rice roots because Cd(2+) and Ca(2+) may have a similar uptake route. Xiushui 11 had a faster root-to-shoot transport of Cd, and the expression level of OsPCR1 gene which was predicted related with Cd accumulation in rice was consist with the Cd transport of root-to-shoot in rice and maintain the greater Cd tolerance of xiushui 11. These results suggest there are different Cd detoxification and accumulation mechanisms in rice cultivars.
26283047	An-2 Encodes a Cytokinin Synthesis Enzyme that Regulates Awn Length and Grain Production in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant	A wide range of morphological and physiological traits have changed between cultivated rice Oryza sativa and wild rice Oryza rufipogon under domestication. Here, we report cloning of the An-2 gene, encoding the Lonely Guy Like protein 6 (OsLOGL6), which catalyzes the final step of cytokinin synthesis in O. rufipogon. The near-isogenic line harboring a wild allele of An-2 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai 4 shows that An-2 promotes awn elongation by enhancing cell division, but decreases grain production by reducing grains per panicle and tillers per plant. We reveal that a genetic variation in the An-2 locus has a large impact on reducing awn length and increasing tiller and grain numbers in domesticated rice. Analysis of gene expression patterns suggests that An-1 regulates the formation of awn primordial, and An-2 promotes awn elongation. Nucleotide diversity of the An-2 locus in cultivated rice was found to be significantly reduced compared with that of wild rice, suggesting that the An-2 locus was subjected to artificial selection. We therefore propose that the selection of genetic variation in An-2 was due to reduced awn length and increased grain yield in cultivated rice.
26276868	Melatonin biosynthesis requires N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase activity of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) methylates N-acetylserotonin into melatonin; that is, it has N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) activity. The ASMT activity of COMT was first detected in Arabidopsis thaliana COMT (AtCOMT). To confirm the involvement of COMT on melatonin synthesis in other plant species, the ASMT activity of a COMT from rice (Oryza sativa) (OsCOMT) was evaluated. Purified recombinant OsCOMT protein from Escherichia coli was used to validate the high ASMT activity of OsCOMT, similar to that of AtCOMT. The K m and V max values for the ASMT activity of OsCOMT were 243 µM and 2400 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1), which were similar to those of AtCOMT. Similar to AtCOMT, OsCOMT was localized in the cytoplasm. In vitro ASMT activity was significantly inhibited by either caffeic acid or quercetin in a dose-dependent manner. Analogously, in vivo production of melatonin was significantly inhibited by quercetin in 4-week-old detached rice leaves. Lastly, the transgenic rice plants overexpressing rice COMT showed an increase in melatonin levels whereas transgenic rice plants suppressing the rice COMT had a significant decrease on melatonin levels, suggestive of the direct role of COMT in melatonin biosynthesis in plants.
26286751	Site-directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 for the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).	2015	J Biol Chem	The C2 domain is one of the most diverse phospholipid-binding domains mediating cellular signaling. One group of C2-domain proteins are plant-specific and are characterized by their small sizes and simple structures. We have previously reported that a member of this group, OsGAP1, is able to alleviate salt stress and stimulate defense responses, and bind to both phospholipids and an unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1. Here we solved the crystal structure of OsGAP1 to a resolution of 1.63 Å. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we successfully differentiated between the clusters of surface residues that are required for binding to phospholipids versus OsYchF1, which, in turn, is critical for its role in stimulating defense responses. On the other hand, the ability to alleviate salt stress by OsGAP1 is dependent only on its ability to bind OsYchF1 and is independent of its phospholipid-binding activity.
26277722	Germin-like protein 2 gene promoter from rice is responsive to fungal pathogens in transgenic potato plants.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	Controlled transgene expression via a promoter is particularly triggered in response to pathogen infiltration. This is significant for eliciting disease-resistant features in crops through genetic engineering. The germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) are known to be associated with plant and developmental stages. The 1107-bp Oryza sativa root GLP2 (OsRGLP2) gene promoter fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was transformed into potato plants through an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The OsRGLP2 promoter was activated in response to Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. and Alternaria solani Sorauer. Quantitative real-time PCR results revealed 4-5-fold increase in promoter activity every 24 h following infection. There was a 15-fold increase in OsRGLP2 promoter activity after 72 h of F. solani (Mart.) Sacc. treatment and a 12-fold increase observed with A. solani Sorauer. Our results confirmed that the OsRGLP2 promoter activity was enhanced under fungal stress. Furthermore, a hyperaccumulation of H2O2 in transgenic plants is a clear signal for the involvement of OsRGLP2 promoter region in the activation of specific genes in the potato genome involved in H2O2-mediated defense response. The OsRGLP2 promoter evidently harbors copies of GT-I and Dof transcription factors (AAAG) that act in response to elicitors generated in the wake of pathogen infection.
25955387	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is involved in various cellular processes including plant-microbe interactions and defense responses. Although there are many E3 ubiquitin ligases in rice, the functions of their targets in defense responses are unclear. We recently found that SPIN6 (SPL11-interacting Protein 6) is a Rho GTPase-activating protein and acts as the target of the E3 ligase SPL11, a negative regulator of plant cell death and innate immunity. Our results showed that SPIN6 serves as a link between the SPL11-mediated ubiquitination pathway and the OsRac1-associated defense system. Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae. OsHub1 and OsHub2 are induced by hormone treatments. Like HUB1 and HUB2 in Arabidopsis, OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 in rice form homo- and hetero-dimers. Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity.
26290597	Patatin-related phospholipase A, pPLAIIIα, modulates the longitudinal growth of vegetative tissues and seeds in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Patatin-related phospholipase A (pPLA) hydrolyses glycerolipids to produce fatty acids and lysoglycerolipids. The Oryza sativa genome has 21 putative pPLAs that are grouped into five subfamilies. Overexpression of OspPLAIIIα resulted in a dwarf phenotype with decreased length of rice stems, roots, leaves, seeds, panicles, and seeds, whereas OspPLAIIIα-knockout plants had longer panicles and seeds. OspPLAIIIα-overexpressing plants were less sensitive than wild-type and knockout plants to gibberellin-promoted seedling elongation. OspPLAIIIα overexpression and knockout had an opposite effect on the expression of the growth repressor SLENDER1 in the gibberellin signalling process. OspPLAIIIα-overexpressing plants had decreased mechanical strength and cellulose content, but exhibited increases in the expression of several cellulose synthase genes. These results indicate that OspPLAIIIα plays a role in rice vegetative and reproductive growth and that the constitutive, high activity of OspPLAIIIα suppresses cell elongation. The decreased gibberellin response in overexpressing plants is probably a result of the decreased ability to make cellulose for anisotropic cell expansion.
26241499	Identification of rice Os4BGlu13 as a β-glucosidase which hydrolyzes gibberellin A4 1-O-β-d-glucosyl ester, in addition to tuberonic acid glucoside and salicylic acid derivative glucosides.	2015	Arch Biochem Biophys	Gibberellin 1-O-β-d-glucose ester hydrolysis activity has been detected in rice seedling extracts, but no enzyme responsible for this activity has ever been purified and identified. Therefore, gibberellin A4 glucosyl ester (GA4-GE) β-d-glucosidase activity was purified from ten-day rice seedling stems and leaves. The family 1 glycoside hydrolase Os4BGlu13 was identified in the final purification fraction. The Os4BGlu13 cDNA was amplified from rice seedlings and expressed as an N-terminal thioredoxin-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant Os4BGlu13 protein (rOs4BGlu13) had an optimum pH of 4.5, for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc), which was the best substrate identified, with a kcat/Km of 637 mM(-1) s(-1). rOs4BGlu13 hydrolyzed helicin best among natural glycosides tested (kcat/Km of 74.4 mM(-1) s(-1)). Os4BGlu13 was previously designated tuberonic acid glucoside (TAG) β-glucosidase (TAGG), and here the kcat/Km of rOsBGlu13 for TAG was 6.68 mM(-1) s(-1), while that for GA4-GE was 3.63 mM(-1) s(-1) and for salicylic acid glucoside (SAG) is 0.88 mM(-1) s(-1). rOs4BGlu13 also hydrolyzed oligosaccharides, with preference for short β-(1 → 3)-linked over β-(1 → 4)-linked glucooligosaccharides. The enzymatic data suggests that Os4BGlu13 may contribute to TAG, SAG, oligosaccharide and GA4-GE hydrolysis in the rice plant, although helicin or a similar compound may be its primary target.
26243209	Loss of function mutations in the rice chromomethylase OsCMT3a cause a burst of transposition.	2015	Plant J	Methylation patterns of plants are unique as, in addition to the methylation at CG dinucleotides that occurs in mammals, methylation also occurs at non-CG sites. Genes are methylated at CG sites, but transposable elements (TEs) are methylated at both CG and non-CG sites. The role of non-CG methylation in transcriptional silencing of TEs is being extensively studied at this time, but only very rare transpositions have been reported when non-CG methylation machineries have been compromised. To understand the role of non-CG methylation in TE suppression and in plant development, we characterized rice mutants with changes in the chromomethylase gene, OsCMT3a. oscmt3a mutants exhibited a dramatic decrease in CHG methylation, changes in the expression of some genes and TEs, and pleiotropic developmental abnormalities. Genome resequencing identified eight TE families mobilized in oscmt3a during normal propagation. These TEs included tissue culture-activated copia retrotransposons Tos17 and Tos19 (Lullaby), a pericentromeric clustered high-copy-number non-autonomous gypsy retrotransposon Dasheng, two copia retrotransposons Osr4 and Osr13, a hAT-tip100 transposon DaiZ, a MITE transposon mPing, and a LINE element LINE1-6_OS. We confirmed the transposition of these TEs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or Southern blot analysis, and showed that transposition was dependent on the oscmt3a mutation. These results demonstrated that OsCMT3a-mediated non-CG DNA methylation plays a critical role in development and in the suppression of a wide spectrum of TEs. These in planta mobile TEs are important for studying the interaction between TEs and the host genome, and for rice functional genomics.
25953146	Genetic architecture of variation in heading date among Asian rice accessions.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Heading date, a crucial factor determining regional and seasonal adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa L.), has been a major selection target in breeding programs. Although considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular regulation of heading date in rice during last two decades, the previously isolated genes and identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) cannot fully explain the natural variation for heading date in diverse rice accessions.

RESULTS: To genetically dissect naturally occurring variation in rice heading date, we collected QTLs in advanced-backcross populations derived from multiple crosses of the japonica rice accession Koshihikari (as a common parental line) with 11 diverse rice accessions (5 indica, 3 aus, and 3 japonica) that originate from various regions of Asia. QTL analyses of over 14,000 backcrossed individuals revealed 255 QTLs distributed widely across the rice genome. Among the detected QTLs, 128 QTLs corresponded to genomic positions of heading date genes identified by previous studies, such as Hd1, Hd6, Hd3a, Ghd7, DTH8, and RFT1. The other 127 QTLs were detected in different chromosomal regions than heading date genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that advanced-backcross progeny allowed us to detect and confirm QTLs with relatively small additive effects, and the natural variation in rice heading date could result from combinations of large- and small-effect QTLs. We also found differences in the genetic architecture of heading date (flowering time) among maize, Arabidopsis, and rice.
26058146	Effect of caffeine on the expression pattern of water-soluble proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings.	2015	Nat Prod Commun	It has been suggested that caffeine acts as an allelochemical which influences the germination and growth of plants. The effect of caffeine on the expression profiles of proteins was investigated in shoot-root axes of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight/Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry was employed for the separation and identification of proteins. The results indicated that amounts of 51 protein spots were reduced and 14 were increased by treatment with 1 mM caffeine. Twelve rice seedling proteins were identified. Down-regulated proteins were β-tubulin, sucrose synthase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, reversibly glycosylated polypeptide/α-1,4-glucan protein synthase and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase. In contrast, up-regulated proteins were alanyl-aminopeptidase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD-malate dehydrogenase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and nuclear RNA binding protein. Possible alternation of metabolism caused by caffeine is discussed with the protein expression data.
25935420	Identification of conserved drought-adaptive genes using a cross-species meta-analysis approach.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Drought is the major environmental stress threatening crop-plant productivity worldwide. Identification of new genes and metabolic pathways involved in plant adaptation to progressive drought stress at the reproductive stage is of great interest for agricultural research.

RESULTS: We developed a novel Cross-Species meta-Analysis of progressive Drought stress at the reproductive stage (CSA:Drought) to identify key drought adaptive genes and mechanisms and to test their evolutionary conservation. Empirically defined filtering criteria were used to facilitate a robust integration of 17 deposited microarray experiments (148 arrays) of Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and barley. By prioritizing consistency over intensity, our approach was able to identify 225 differentially expressed genes shared across studies and taxa. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses classified the shared genes into functional categories involved predominantly in metabolic processes (e.g. amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism), regulatory function (e.g. protein degradation and transcription) and response to stimulus. We further investigated drought related cis-acting elements in the shared gene promoters, and the evolutionary conservation of shared genes. The universal nature of the identified drought-adaptive genes was further validated in a fifth species, Brachypodium distachyon that was not included in the meta-analysis. qPCR analysis of 27, randomly selected, shared orthologs showed similar expression pattern as was found by the CSA:Drought.In accordance, morpho-physiological characterization of progressive drought stress, in B. distachyon, highlighted the key role of osmotic adjustment as evolutionary conserved drought-adaptive mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS: Our CSA:Drought strategy highlights major drought-adaptive genes and metabolic pathways that were only partially, if at all, reported in the original studies included in the meta-analysis. These genes include a group of unclassified genes that could be involved in novel drought adaptation mechanisms. The identified shared genes can provide a useful resource for subsequent research to better understand the mechanisms involved in drought adaptation across-species and can serve as a potential set of molecular biomarkers for progressive drought experiments.
26259169	Cold tolerance in rice germinating seeds revealed by deep RNAseq analysis of contrasting indica genotypes.	2015	Plant Sci	Rice productivity is largely affected by low temperature, which can be harmful throughout plant development, from germination to grain filling. Germination of indica rice cultivars under cold is slow and not uniform, resulting in irregular emergence and small plant population. To identify and characterize novel genes involved in cold tolerance during the germination stage, two indica rice genotypes (sister lines previously identified as cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive) were used in parallel transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) under cold treatment (seeds germinating at 13 °C for 7 days). We detected 1,361 differentially expressed transcripts. Differences in gene expression found by RNAseq were confirmed for 11 selected genes using RT-qPCR. Biological processes enhanced in the cold-tolerant seedlings include: cell division and expansion (confirmed by anatomical sections of germinating seeds), cell wall integrity and extensibility, water uptake and membrane transport capacity, sucrose synthesis, generation of simple sugars, unsaturation of membrane fatty acids, wax biosynthesis, antioxidant capacity (confirmed by histochemical staining of H2O2), and hormone and Ca(2+)-signaling. The cold-sensitive seedlings respond to low temperature stress increasing synthesis of HSPs and dehydrins, along with enhanced ubiquitin/proteasome protein degradation pathway and polyamine biosynthesis. Our findings can be useful in future biotechnological approaches aiming to cold tolerance in indica rice.
26025049	The WRKY45-Dependent Signaling Pathway Is Required For Resistance against Striga hermonthica Parasitism.	2015	Plant Physiol	The root hemiparasite witchweed (Striga spp.) is a devastating agricultural pest that causes losses of up to $1 billion US annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Development of resistant crops is one of the cost-effective ways to address this problem. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance are not well understood. To understand molecular events upon Striga spp. infection, we conducted genome-scale RNA sequencing expression analysis using Striga hermonthica-infected rice (Oryza sativa) roots. We found that transcripts grouped under the Gene Ontology term defense response were significantly enriched in up-regulated differentially expressed genes. In particular, we found that both jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways were induced, but the induction of the JA pathway preceded that of the SA pathway. Foliar application of JA resulted in higher resistance. The hebiba mutant plants, which lack the JA biosynthesis gene allene oxide cyclase, exhibited severe S. hermonthica susceptibility. The resistant phenotype was recovered by application of JA. By contrast, the SA-deficient NahG rice plants were resistant against S. hermonthica, indicating that endogenous SA is not required for resistance. However, knocking down WRKY45, a regulator of the SA/benzothiadiazole pathway, resulted in enhanced susceptibility. Interestingly, NahG plants induced the JA pathway, which was down-regulated in WRKY45-knockdown plants, linking the resistant and susceptible phenotypes to the JA pathway. Consistently, the susceptibility phenotype in the WRKY45-knockdown plants was recovered by foliar JA application. These results point to a model in which WRKY45 modulates a cross talk in resistance against S. hermonthica by positively regulating both SA/benzothiadiazole and JA pathways.
26019258	Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy imaging for laterally resolved speciation of selenium in fresh roots and leaves of wheat and rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Knowledge of the distribution of selenium (Se) species within plant tissues will assist in understanding the mechanisms of Se uptake and translocation, but in situ analysis of fresh and highly hydrated plant tissues is challenging. Using synchrotron-based fluorescence X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) imaging to provide laterally resolved data, the speciation of Se in fresh roots and leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) supplied with 1 μM of either selenate or selenite was investigated. For plant roots exposed to selenate, the majority of the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds (i.e. methylselenocysteine or selenomethionine) as selenate was transported radially through the root cylinder. Indeed, even in the rhizodermis which is exposed directly to the bulk solution, only 12-31% of the Se was present as uncomplexed selenate. The C-Se-C compounds were probably sequestered within the roots, whilst much of the remaining uncomplexed Se was translocated to the leaves-selenate accounting for 52-56% of the total Se in the leaves. In a similar manner, for plants exposed to selenite, the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds within the roots, with only a small proportion of uncomplexed selenite observed within the outer root tissues. This resulted in a substantial decrease in translocation of Se from the roots to leaves of selenite-exposed plants. This study provides important information for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the uptake and subsequent transformation of Se in plants.
26141895	Can arbuscular mycorrhiza and fertilizer management reduce phosphorus runoff from paddy fields?	2015	J Environ Sci (China)	Our study sought to assess how much phosphorus (P) runoff from paddy fields could be cut down by fertilizer management and inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. A field experiment was conducted in Lalin River basin, in the northeast China: six nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer levels were provided (0, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the recommended fertilizer supply), with or without inoculation with Glomus mosseae. The volume and concentrations of particle P (PP) and dissolved P (DP) were measured for each runoff during the rice growing season. It was found that the seasonal P runoff, including DP and PP, under the local fertilization was 3.7 kg/ha, with PP, rather than DP, being the main form of P in runoff water. Additionally, the seasonal P runoff dropped only by 8.9% when fertilization decreased by 20%; rice yields decreased with declining fertilization. We also found that inoculation increased rice yields and decreased P runoff at each fertilizer level and these effects were lower under higher fertilization. Conclusively, while rice yields were guaranteed arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation and fertilizer management would play a key role in reducing P runoff from paddy fields.
25961557	Root-Derived Short-Chain Suberin Diacids from Rice and Rape Seed in a Paddy Soil under Rice Cultivar Treatments.	2015	PLoS One	Suberin-derived substituted fatty acids have been shown to be potential biomarkers for plant-derived carbon (C) in soils across ecosystems. Analyzing root derived suberin compounds bound in soil could help to understand the root input into a soil organic carbon pool. In this study, bound lipids were extracted and identified in root and topsoil samples. Short-chain suberin diacids were quantified under rice (Oryza sativa L.) and rape (Brassica campestris) rotations with different cultivar combinations in a Chinese rice paddy. After removal of free lipids with sequential extraction, the residual bound lipids were obtained with saponification and derivatization before analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Diacids C16 and C18 in bound lipids were detected both in rice and rape root samples, while diacids C20 and C22 were detected only in rape root samples. Accordingly, diacids were quantified in both rhizosphere and bulk soil (0-15 cm). The amount of total root-derived diacids in bulk soil varied in a range of 5.6-9.6 mg/kg across growth stages and crop seasons. After one year-round rice-rape rotation, root-derived suberin diacids were maintained at a level of 7-9 mg/kg in bulk soil; this was higher under a super rice cultivar LY than under a hybrid cultivar IIY. While concentrations of the analyzed diacids were generally higher in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, the total diacid (DA) concentration was higher at the time of rape harvest than at rice harvest, suggesting that rape roots made a major contribution to the preservation of diacids in the paddy. Moreover, the net change in the concentration and the ratios of C16:0 DA to C18:1 DA, and of C16:0 DA to C18:0 DA, over a whole growing season, were greater under LY than under IIY, though there was no difference between cultivars within a single growth stage. Overall, total concentration of root-derived suberin diacids was found to be positively correlated to soil organic carbon concentration both for bulk soil and rhizosphere. However, the turnover and preservation of the root suberin biomolecules with soil property and field conditions deserve further field studies.
25947970	Effect of iron plaque on antimony uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Environ Pollut	Although iron (Fe) plaque has been shown to significantly affect the uptake of toxic antimony (Sb) by rice, knowledge about the influence of iron plaque on antimony (Sb) (amount, mechanisms, etc) is, however, limited. Here, the effect of Fe plaque on Sb(III) and Sb(V) (nominal oxidation states) uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L.) was investigated using hydroponic experiments and synchrotron-based techniques. The results showed that iron plaque immobilized Sb on the surface of rice roots. Although the binding capacity of iron plaque for Sb(III) was markedly greater than that for Sb(V), significantly more Sb(III) was taken up by roots and transported to shoots. In the presence of Fe plaque, Sb uptake into rice roots was significantly reduced, especially for Sb(III). However, this did not translate into decreasing Sb concentrations in rice shoots and even increased shoot Sb concentrations during high Fe-Sb(III) treatment.
25938231	Manipulation of the rice L-galactose pathway: evaluation of the effects of transgene overexpression on ascorbate accumulation and abiotic stress tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	Ascorbic acid (AsA) is the most abundant water-soluble antioxidant in plants, and it plays a crucial role in plant growth, development and abiotic stress tolerance. In the present study, six key Arabidopsis or rapeseed genes involved in AsA biosynthesis were constitutively overexpressed in an elite Japonica rice cultivar. These genes encoded the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP), GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME), GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP), L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (GPP), L-galactose dehydrogenase (GDH), and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH). The effects of transgene expression on rice leaf AsA accumulation were carefully evaluated. In homozygous transgenic seedlings, AtGGP transgenic lines had the highest AsA contents (2.55-fold greater than the empty vector transgenic control), followed by the AtGME and AtGDH transgenic lines. Moreover, with the exception of the AtGPP lines, the increased AsA content also provoked an increase in the redox state (AsA/DHA ratio). To evaluate salt tolerance, AtGGP and AtGME transgenic seedlings were exposed to salt stress for one week. The relative plant height, root length and fresh weight growth rates were significantly higher for the transgenic lines compared with the control plants. Altogether, our results suggest that GGP may be a key rate-limiting step in rice AsA biosynthesis, and the plants with elevated AsA contents demonstrated enhanced tolerance for salt stress.
25983205	A cooperative system of silicon transport in plants.	2015	Trends Plant Sci	The high accumulation of silicon (Si) protects plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. Two different types of Si transporter [Low Silicon 1 (Lsi1) and 2 (Lsi2)] involved in the uptake and distribution of Si have been identified. Lsi1, a Si permeable channel, belongs to the Nod26-like major intrinsic protein (NIP) III subgroup of the aquaporin membrane protein family with a distinct selectivity, whereas Lsi2, an efflux Si transporter, belongs to an uncharacterized anion transporter family. These transporters are localized to the plasma membrane, but, in different plant species, show different expression patterns and tissue or cellular localizations that are associated with different levels of Si accumulation. A recent mathematical modeling study revealed that cooperation of Lsi1 and Lsi2, which show a polarized localization, is required for the efficient transport of Si in rice.
26008792	Evolutionary analysis of RB/Rpi-blb1 locus in the Solanaceae family.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Late blight caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans is one of the most severe threats to potato production worldwide. Numerous studies suggest that the most effective protective strategy against the disease would be to provide potato cultivars with durable resistance (R) genes. However, little is known about the origin and evolutional history of these durable R-genes in potato. Addressing this might foster better understanding of the dynamics of these genes in nature and provide clues for identifying potential candidate R-genes. Here, a systematic survey was executed at RB/Rpi-blb1 locus, an exclusive broad-spectrum R-gene locus in potato. As indicated by synteny analysis, RB/Rpi-blb1 homologs were identified in all tested genomes, including potato, tomato, pepper, and Nicotiana, suggesting that the RB/Rpi-blb1 locus has an ancient origin. Two evolutionary patterns, similar to those reported on RGC2 in Lactuca, and Pi2/9 in rice, were detected at this locus. Type I RB/Rpi-blb1 homologs have frequent copy number variations and sequence exchanges, obscured orthologous relationships, considerable nucleotide divergence, and high non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) between or within species, suggesting rapid diversification and balancing selection in response to rapid changes in the oomycete pathogen genomes. These characteristics may serve as signatures for cloning of late blight resistance genes.
26029330	Transcriptome profiling of the spl5 mutant reveals that SPL5 has a negative role in the biosynthesis of serotonin for rice disease resistance.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice mutant, spl5 (spotted leaf 5), has spontaneous hypersensitive-like lesions on its leaves and shows enhanced resistance to pathogens, indicating that SPL5 plays a role in programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance. To understand the molecular mechanism of SPL5 gene, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of the spl5 mutant leaves with few lesions (FL) and leaves with many lesions (ML) compared to the wild-type (WT) leaves respectively by microarray.

RESULTS: The data from microarray revealed that 243 and 896 candidate genes (Fold change ≥ 3.0) were up- or down-regulated in the spl5-FL and spl5-ML, respectively, and a large number of these genes involved in biotic defense responses or reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Interestingly, according to our microarray and real-time PCR assays, the expressions of a transcription factor OsWRKY14 and genes responsible for the biosynthesis of serotonin, anthranilate synthase (AS), indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS), tryptophan synthase (TS) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) were significantly up-regulated in the spl5 mutant. It has been reported previously that TS and TDC expressions are regulated by OsWRKY14 in rice, which raises the possibility that OsWRKY14 regulates serotonin production through the up-regulation of TS and TDC. Our HPLC analysis further confirmed that serotonin levels were higher in the leaves of spl5 mutant than that in WT.

CONCLUSIONS: Since the serotonin plays a critical role in inducing disease-resistance, the increased serotonin level may contribute, at least partly, to the disease resistance in spl5. The SPL5 gene may act as a negative regulatory factor activating the serotonin metabolic pathway, and these results might provide a new insight into the spl5-induced defense response mechanisms in plants.
26042132	Salicylic acid modulates arsenic toxicity by reducing its root to shoot translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Front Plant Sci	Arsenic (As) is posing serious health concerns in South East Asia where rice, an efficient accumulator of As, is prominent crop. Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signaling molecule and plays a crucial role in resistance against biotic and abiotic stress in plants. In present study, ameliorative effect of SA against arsenate (As(V)) toxicity has been investigated in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Arsenate stress hampered the plant growth in terms of root, shoots length, and biomass as well as it enhanced the level of H2O2 and MDA in dose dependent manner in shoot. Exogenous application of SA, reverted the growth, and oxidative stress caused by As(V) and significantly decreased As translocation to the shoots. Level of As in shoot was positively correlated with the expression of OsLsi2, eﬄux transporter responsible for root to shoot translocation of As in the form of arsenite (As(III)). SA also overcame As(V) induced oxidative stress and modulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes in a differential manner in shoots. As treatment hampered the translocation of Fe in the shoot which was compensated by the SA treatment. The level of Fe in root and shoot was positively correlated with the transcript level of transporters responsible for the accumulation of Fe, OsNRAMP5, and OsFRDL1, in the root and shoot, respectively. Co-application of SA was more effective than pre-treatment for reducing As accumulation as well as imposed toxicity.
25589060	Abscisic acid and the key enzymes and genes in sucrose-to-starch conversion in rice spikelets in response to soil drying during grain filling.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Abscisic acid mediates the effect of post-anthesis soil drying on grain filling through regulating the activities of key enzymes and expressions of genes involved in sucrose-to-starch conversion in rice spikelets. This study investigated if abscisic acid (ABA) would mediate the effect of post-anthesis soil drying on grain filling through regulating the key enzymes in sucrose-to-starch conversion in rice (Oryza sativa L.) spikelets. Two rice cultivars were field-grown. Three treatments, well-watered (WW), moderate soil drying (MD), and severe soil drying (SD), were imposed from 6 days after full heading until maturity. When compared with those under the WW, grain filling rate, grain weight, and sink activity, in terms of the activities and gene expression levels of sucrose synthase, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase, and starch branching enzyme, in inferior spikelets were substantially increased under the MD, whereas they were markedly decreased in both superior and inferior spikelets under the SD. The two cultivars showed the same tendencies. Both MD and SD increased ABA content and expression levels of its biosynthesis genes in spikelets, with more increase under the SD than the MD. ABA content was significantly correlated with grain filling rate and sink activities under both WW and MD, while the correlations were not significant under the SD. Application of a low concentration ABA to WW plants imitated the results under the MD, and applying with a high concentration ABA showed the effect of the SD. The results suggest that ABA plays a vital role in grain filling through regulating sink activity and functions in a dose-dependent manner. An elevated ABA level under the MD enhances, whereas a too high level of ABA under the SD decreases, sink activity.
26072143	Phloem-exudate proteome analysis of response to insect brown plant-hopper in rice.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Brown plant-hopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH), one of the most devastating agricultural insect pests of rice throughout Asia, ingests nutrients from rice sieve tubes and causes a dramatic yield loss. Planting resistant variety is an efficient and economical way to control this pest. Understanding the mechanisms of host resistance is extremely valuable for molecular design of resistant rice variety. Here, we used an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach to perform analysis of protein expression profiles in the phloem exudates of BPH-resistant and susceptible rice plants following BPH infestation. A total of 238 proteins were identified, most of which were previously described to be present in the phloem of rice and other plants. The expression of genes for selected proteins was confirmed using a laser capture micro-dissection method and RT-PCR. The mRNAs for three proteins, RGAP, TCTP, and TRXH, were further analyzed by using in situ mRNA hybridization and localized in the phloem cells. Our results showed that BPH feeding induced significant changes in the abundance of proteins in phloem sap of rice involved in multiple pathways, including defense signal transduction, redox regulation, and carbohydrate and protein metabolism, as well as cell structural proteins. The results presented provide new insights into rice resistance mechanisms and should facilitate the breeding of novel elite BPH-resistant rice varieties.
26022255	Phenotypic and genetic dissection of component traits for early vigour in rice using plant growth modelling, sugar content analyses and association mapping.	2015	J Exp Bot	Early vigour of rice, defined as seedling capacity to accumulate shoot dry weight (SDW) rapidly, is a complex trait. It depends on a genotype propensity to assimilate, store, and/or use non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) for producing large and/or numerous leaves, involving physiological trade-offs in the expression of component traits and, possibly, physiological and genetic linkages. This study explores a plant-model-assisted phenotyping approach to dissect the genetic architecture of rice early vigour, applying the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to morphological and NSC measurements, as well as fitted parameters for the functional-structural plant model, Ecomeristem. Leaf size, number, SDW, and source-leaf NSC concentration were measured on a panel of 123 japonica accessions. The data were used to estimate Ecomeristem genotypic parameters driving organ appearance rate, size, and carbon dynamics. GWAS was performed based on 12 221 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Twenty-three associations were detected at P <1×10(-4) and 64 at P <5×10(-4). Associations for NSC and model parameters revealed new regions related to early vigour that had greater significance than morphological traits, providing additional information on the genetic control of early vigour. Plant model parameters were used to characterize physiological and genetic trade-offs among component traits. Twelve associations were related to loci for cloned genes, with nine related to organogenesis, plant height, cell size or cell number. The potential use of these associations as markers for breeding is discussed.
25973946	Revisiting GMOs: Are There Differences in European Consumers' Acceptance and Valuation for Cisgenically vs Transgenically Bred Rice?	2015	PLoS One	Both cisgenesis and transgenesis are plant breeding techniques that can be used to introduce new genes into plant genomes. However, transgenesis uses gene(s) from a non-plant organism or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant while cisgenesis involves the introduction of gene(s) from a crossable--sexually compatible--plant. Traditional breeding techniques could possibly achieve the same results as those from cisgenesis, but would require a much larger timeframe. Cisgenesis allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar more quickly and with little to no genetic drag. The current regulation in the European Union (EU) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) treats cisgenic plants the same as transgenic plants and both are mandatorily labeled as GMOs. This study estimates European consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, cisgenic, with environmental benefits (which cisgenesis could provide), or any combination of these three attributes. Data were collected from 3,002 participants through an online survey administered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to model consumers' WTP in each country. Model estimates highlight significant differences in WTP across countries. In all five countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid purchasing rice labeled as GM. In all countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly higher WTP to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM compared to rice labeled as cisgenic, suggesting that inserting genes from the plant's own gene pool is more acceptable to consumers. Additionally, French consumers are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. These findings suggest that not all GMOs are the same in consumers' eyes and thus, from a consumer preference perspective, the differences between transgenic and cisgenic products are recommended to be reflected in GMO labeling and trade policies.
25972274	Photochemical properties in flag leaves of a super-high-yielding hybrid rice and a traditional hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) probed by chlorophyll a fluorescence transient.	2015	Photosynth Res	Chlorophyll a fluorescence of flag leaves in a super-high-yielding hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) LYPJ, and a traditional hybrid rice SY63 cultivar with lower grain yield, which were grown in the field, were investigated from emergence through senescence of flag leaves. As the flag leaf matured, there was an increasing trend in photosynthetic parameters such as quantum efficiency of primary photochemistry ([Formula: see text] Po) and efficiency of electron transport from PS II to PS I (Ψ Eo). The overall photosynthetic performance index (PIABS) was significantly higher in the high-yielding LYPJ compared to SY63 during the entire reproductive stage of the plant, the same to MDA content. However, [Formula: see text] Po(=F V/F M), an indicator of the primary photochemistry of the flag leaf, did not display significant changes with leaf age and was not significantly different between the two cultivars, suggesting that PIABS is a more sensitive parameter than [Formula: see text] Po (=F V/F M) during leaf age for distinguishing between cultivars differing in yield.
25951083	Transcriptome-wide identification of salt-responsive members of the WRKY gene family in Gossypium aridum.	2015	PLoS One	WRKY transcription factors are plant-specific, zinc finger-type transcription factors. The WRKY superfamily is involved in abiotic stress responses in many crops including cotton, a major fiber crop that is widely cultivated and consumed throughout the world. Salinity is an important abiotic stress that results in considerable yield losses. In this study, we identified 109 WRKY genes (GarWRKYs) in a salt-tolerant wild cotton species Gossypium aridum from transcriptome sequencing data to elucidate the roles of these factors in cotton salt tolerance. According to their structural features, the predicted members were divided into three groups (Groups I-III), as previously described for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, 28 salt-responsive GarWRKY genes were identified from digital gene expression data and subjected to real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The expression patterns of most GarWRKY genes revealed by this analysis are in good agreement with those revealed by RNA-Seq analysis. RT-PCR analysis revealed that 27 GarWRKY genes were expressed in roots and one was exclusively expressed in roots. Analysis of gene orthology and motif compositions indicated that WRKY members from Arabidopsis, rice and soybean generally shared the similar motifs within the same subgroup, suggesting they have the similar function. Overexpression-GarWRKY17 and -GarWRKY104 in Arabidopsis revealed that they could positively regulate salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis during different development stages. The comprehensive data generated in this study provide a platform for elucidating the functions of WRKY transcription factors in salt tolerance of G. aridum. In addition, GarWRKYs related to salt tolerance identified in this study will be potential candidates for genetic improvement of cultivated cotton salt stress tolerance.
25995326	MAOHUZI6/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE2 Regulate Ethylene Response of Roots and Coleoptiles and Negatively Affect Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Ethylene plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. The ethylene signaling pathway has been studied extensively, mainly in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, the molecular mechanism of ethylene signaling is largely unknown in rice (Oryza sativa). Previously, we have isolated a set of rice ethylene-response mutants. Here, we characterized the mutant maohuzi6 (mhz6). Through map-based cloning, we found that MHZ6 encodes ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (OsEIL1), a rice homolog of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), which is the master transcriptional regulator of ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis. Disruption of MHZ6/OsEIL1 caused ethylene insensitivity mainly in roots, whereas silencing of the closely related OsEIL2 led to ethylene insensitivity mainly in coleoptiles of etiolated seedlings. This organ-specific functional divergence is different from the functional features of EIN3 and EIL1, both of which mediate the incomplete ethylene responses of Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings. In Arabidopsis, EIN3 and EIL1 play positive roles in plant salt tolerance. In rice, however, lack of MHZ6/OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 functions improves salt tolerance, whereas the overexpressing lines exhibit salt hypersensitivity at the seedling stage, indicating that MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 negatively regulate salt tolerance in rice. Furthermore, this negative regulation by MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in salt tolerance is likely attributable in part to the direct regulation of HIGH-AFFINITY K(+) TRANSPORTER2;1 expression and Na(+) uptake in roots. Additionally, MHZ6/OsEIL1 overexpression promotes grain size and thousand-grain weight. Together, our study provides insights for the functional diversification of MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in ethylene response and finds a novel mode of ethylene-regulated salt stress response that could be helpful for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
25979979	DroughtDB: an expert-curated compilation of plant drought stress genes and their homologs in nine species.	2015	Database (Oxford)	Plants are sessile and therefore exposed to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses. Drought is the major abiotic stress restricting plant growth worldwide. A number of genes involved in drought stress response have already been characterized, mainly in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. However, with the aim to produce drought tolerant crop varieties, it is of importance to identify the respective orthologs for each species. We have developed DroughtDB, a manually curated compilation of molecularly characterized genes that are involved in drought stress response. DroughtDB includes information about the originally identified gene, its physiological and/or molecular function and mutant phenotypes and provides detailed information about computed orthologous genes in nine model and crop plant species including maize and barley. All identified orthologs are interlinked with the respective reference entry in MIPS/PGSB PlantsDB, which allows retrieval of additional information like genome context and sequence information. Thus, DroughtDB is a valuable resource and information tool for researchers working on drought stress and will facilitate the identification, analysis and characterization of genes involved in drought stress tolerance in agriculturally important crop plants.

25941326	Accumulation of long-lived mRNAs associated with germination in embryos during seed development of rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Mature dry seeds contain translatable mRNAs called long-lived mRNAs. Early studies have shown that protein synthesis during the initial phase of seed germination occurs from long-lived mRNAs, without de novo transcription. However, the gene expression systems that generate long-lived mRNAs in seeds are not well understood. To examine the accumulation of long-lived mRNAs in developing rice embryos, germination tests using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D) were performed with the Japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Although over 70% of embryos at 10 days after flowering (DAF) germinated in the absence of the inhibitor, germination was remarkably impaired in embryos treated with Act D. In contrast, more than 70% of embryos at 20, 25, 30 and 40 DAF germinated in the presence of Act D. The same results were obtained when another cultivar, Koshihikari, was used, indicating that the long-lived mRNAs required for germination predominantly accumulate in embryos between 10 and 20 DAF during seed development. RNA-Seq identified 529 long-lived mRNA candidates, encoding proteins such as ABA, calcium ion and phospholipid signalling-related proteins, and HSP DNA J, increased from 10 to 20 DAF and were highly abundant in 40 DAF embryos of Nipponbare and Koshihikari. We also revealed that these long-lived mRNA candidates are clearly up-regulated in 10 DAF germinating embryos after imbibition, suggesting that the accumulation of these mRNAs in embryos is indispensable for the induction of germination. The findings presented here may facilitate in overcoming irregular seed germination or producing more vigorous seedlings.
25781542	Plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxins: functions in developmental processes and stress responses.	2015	Biol Chem	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are small oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin family proteins that can either regulate the thiol redox state of proteins or are linked to iron metabolism because of their ability to incorporate iron-sulfur [2Fe-2S] clusters. Here we review recent research on a land plant-specific class of GRX-like proteins, which are characterized by the conserved CC motif in the active centre. Loss-of-function mutants of CC-type GRXs in Arabidopsis (also named ROXYs), maize, and rice have unraveled a role in floral development, including regulation of organ primordia initiation, control of organ identity gene expression, and progression into meiosis in the male germ line. Other CC-type GRXs play a role in stress responses, most likely through their capacity to regulate nuclear gene expression. Consistently, CC-type GRXs, physically and genetically interact with individual members of the TGA transcription factor family. One of the challenges in the future is to unravel whether ROXYs control the redox state of TGA factors or other yet unknown target proteins or whether they regulate gene expression through other processes. Other intriguing questions concern the original function of the first CC-type GRXs in basal land plants and their potential contribution to the extremely successful radiation of angiosperms.
25993896	Dynamic evolution of resistance gene analogs in the orthologous genomic regions of powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 in Triticum dicoccoides and Aegilops tauschii.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Rapid evolution of powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 orthologous genomic regions in wheat subgenomes. Wheat is one of the most important staple grain crops in the world and also an excellent model for plant ploidy evolution research with different ploidy levels from diploid to hexaploid. Powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici can result in significant loss in both grain yield and quality in wheat. In this study, the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 locus located at the Triticum dicoccoides chromosome 2B short arm was further characterized by constructing and sequencing a BAC-based physical map contig covering a 0.3 cM genetic distance region (880 kb) and developing additional markers to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.16 cM genetic interval (372 kb). Comparative analyses of the T. dicoccoides 2BS region with the orthologous Aegilops tauschii 2DS region showed great gene colinearity, including the structure organization of both types of RGA1/2-like and RPS2-like resistance genes. Comparative analyses with the orthologous regions from Brachypodium and rice genomes revealed considerable dynamic evolutionary changes that have re-shaped this MlIW170 region in the wheat genome, resulting in a high number of non-syntenic genes including resistance-related genes. This result might reflect the rapid evolution in R-gene regions. Phylogenetic analysis on these resistance-related gene sequences indicated the duplication of these genes in the MlIW170 region, occurred before the separation of the wheat B and D genomes.
26052332	Extensive sequence variation in rice blast resistance gene Pi54 makes it broad spectrum in nature.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Rice blast resistant gene, Pi54 cloned from rice line, Tetep, is effective against diverse isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, we prospected the allelic variants of the dominant blast resistance gene from a set of 92 rice lines to determine the nucleotide diversity, pattern of its molecular evolution, phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary dynamics, and to develop allele specific markers. High quality sequences were generated for homologs of Pi54 gene. Using comparative sequence analysis, InDels of variable sizes in all the alleles were observed. Profiling of the selected sites of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and amino acids (N sites ≥ 10) exhibited constant frequency distribution of mutational and substitutional sites between the resistance and susceptible rice lines, respectively. A total of 50 new haplotypes based on the nucleotide polymorphism was also identified. A unique haplotype (H_3) was found to be linked to all the resistant alleles isolated from indica rice lines. Unique leucine zipper and tyrosine sulfation sites were identified in the predicted Pi54 proteins. Selection signals were observed in entire coding sequence of resistance alleles, as compared to LRR domains for susceptible alleles. This is a maiden report of extensive variability of Pi54 alleles in different landraces and cultivated varieties, possibly, attributing broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. The sequence variation in two consensus region: 163 and 144 bp were used for the development of allele specific DNA markers. Validated markers can be used for the selection and identification of better allele(s) and their introgression in commercial rice cultivars employing marker assisted selection.
25988582	SWEETs, transporters for intracellular and intercellular sugar translocation.	2015	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Three families of transporters have been identified as key players in intercellular transport of sugars: MSTs (monosaccharide transporters), SUTs (sucrose transporters) and SWEETs (hexose and sucrose transporters). MSTs and SUTs fall into the major facilitator superfamily; SWEETs constitute a structurally different class of transporters with only seven transmembrane spanning domains. The predicted topology of SWEETs is supported by crystal structures of bacterial homologs (SemiSWEETs). On average, angiosperm genomes contain ∼20 paralogs, most of which serve distinct physiological roles. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET8 and 13 feed the pollen; SWEET11 and 12 provide sucrose to the SUTs for phloem loading; AtSWEET11, 12 and 15 have distinct roles in seed filling; AtSWEET16 and 17 are vacuolar hexose transporters; and SWEET9 is essential for nectar secretion. The remaining family members await characterization, and could play roles in the gametophyte as well as other important roles in sugar transport in the plant. In rice and cassava, and possibly other systems, sucrose transporting SWEETs play central roles in pathogen resistance. Notably, the human genome also contains a glucose transporting isoform. Further analysis promises new insights into mechanism and regulation of assimilate allocation and a new potential for increasing crop yield.
26052337	Cloning and functional validation of early inducible Magnaporthe oryzae responsive CYP76M7 promoter from rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Cloning and functional characterization of plant pathogen inducible promoters is of great significance for their use in the effective management of plant diseases. The rice gene CYP76M7 was up regulated at 24, 48, and 72 hours post inoculation (hpi) with two isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae Mo-ei-11 and Mo-ni-25. In this study, the promoter of CYP76M7 gene was cloned from rice cultivar HR-12, characterized and functionally validated. The Transcription Start Site of CYP76M7 was mapped at 45 bases upstream of the initiation codon. To functionally validate the promoter, 5' deletion analysis of the promoter sequences was performed and the deletion fragments fused with the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were used for generating stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants as well as for transient expression in rice. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of GUS in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and also in transiently expressed rice leaves revealed that the promoter of CYP76M7 gene was induced by M. oryzae. The induction of CYP76M7 promoter was observed at 24 hpi with M. oryzae. We report that, sequences spanning -222 bp to -520 bp, with the cluster of three W-boxes, two ASF1 motifs and a single GT-1 element may contribute to the M. oryzae inducible nature of CYP76M7 promoter. The promoter characterized in this study would be an ideal candidate for the overexpression of defense genes in rice for developing durable blast resistance rice lines.
26054243	Pyramiding of three bacterial blight resistance genes for broad-spectrum resistance in deepwater rice variety, Jalmagna.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Jalmagna is a popular deepwater rice variety with farmers of India because of its good yield under waterlogged condition. However, the variety is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease. The development of resistant cultivars has been the most effective and economical strategy to control the disease under deepwater situation. Three resistance genes (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21) were transferred from Swarna BB pyramid line, using a marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB) breeding strategy, into the BB-susceptible elite deepwater cultivar, Jalmagna.

RESULTS: Molecular marker integrated backcross breeding program has been employed to transfer three major BB resistance genes (Xa21, xa13 and xa5) into Jalmagna variety. During backcross generations, markers closely linked to the three genes were used to select plants possessing these resistance genes and markers polymorphic between donor and recurrent parent were used to select plants that have maximum contribution from the recurrent parent genome. A selected BC3F1 plant was selfed to generate homozygous BC3F2 plants with different combinations of BB resistance genes. The three-gene pyramid and two gene pyramid lines exhibited high levels of resistance against the BB pathogen. Under conditions of BB infection, the three-gene pyramided lines exhibited a significant yield advantage over Jalmagna. The selected pyramided lines showed all agro-morphologic traits of Jalmagna without compromising the yield.

CONCLUSION: The three major BB resistance genes pyramided lines exhibited high level of resistance and are expected to provide durable resistance under deep water situation where control through chemicals is less effective. High similarity in agro-morphologic traits and absence of antagonistic effects for yield and other characters were observed in the best pyramided lines.
26025543	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	2015	Plant Sci	Auxin signaling is a fundamental part of many plant growth processes and stress responses and operates through Aux/IAA protein degradation and the transmission of the signal via auxin response factors (ARFs). A total of 31 Aux/IAA genes have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa), some of which are induced by drought stress. However, the mechanistic link between Aux/IAA expression and drought responses is not well understood. In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes. We observed that OsIAA6 was specifically expressed in the axillary meristem of the basal stem, which is the tissue that gives rise to tillers. A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1. Our results confirm that the OsIAA6 gene is involved in drought stress responses and the control of tiller outgrowth.
25937463	Identification of 7 stress-related NAC transcription factor members in maize (Zea mays L.) and characterization of the expression pattern of these genes.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	NAC proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that play essential roles in plant development and various abiotic stress responses. A comprehensive analysis of maize NAC genes was performed in this study. A total of 157 non-redundant maize NAC genes including seven membrane-bound members were identified and found to be unevenly distributed on 10 maize chromosomes. Motif composition analysis indicated that the maize NAC proteins share three relatively conserved motifs in the NAC domain within the N-terminal region. Phylogenetic analysis of 157 maize NAC proteins accompanied by 117 NAC proteins from Arabidopsis and 151 from rice were presented. The NAC proteins evaluated were divided into two large groups including 18 subgroups. Gene duplication analysis indicated that gene loss occurred during maize evolution. Seven NAC members that belong to the same clade of maize NAC domain genes were isolated, and overlapping expression patterns were observed under various abiotic stresses, including low temperature, high salinity and dehydration, and phytohormone abscisic acid treatments. This suggested that NAC members function as stress-responsive transcription factors in ABA-dependent signaling pathways. Relatively higher expression levels of these selected maize NAC genes were detected in roots. The stress responsive NAC genes may have applications in molecular breeding to improve crop stress tolerance.
25979995	Amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes from developing rice seed form enzymatically active protein complexes.	2015	J Exp Bot	Amylopectin is a highly branched, organized cluster of glucose polymers, and the major component of rice starch. Synthesis of amylopectin requires fine co-ordination between elongation of glucose polymers by soluble starch synthases (SSs), generation of branches by branching enzymes (BEs), and removal of misplaced branches by debranching enzymes (DBEs). Among the various isozymes having a role in amylopectin biosynthesis, limited numbers of SS and BE isozymes have been demonstrated to interact via protein-protein interactions in maize and wheat amyloplasts. This study investigated whether protein-protein interactions are also found in rice endosperm, as well as exploring differences between species. Gel permeation chromatography of developing rice endosperm extracts revealed that all 10 starch biosynthetic enzymes analysed were present at larger molecular weights than their respective monomeric sizes. SSIIa, SSIIIa, SSIVb, BEI, BEIIb, and PUL co-eluted at mass sizes >700kDa, and SSI, SSIIa, BEIIb, ISA1, PUL, and Pho1 co-eluted at 200-400kDa. Zymogram analyses showed that SSI, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIa, BEIIb, ISA1, PUL, and Pho1 eluted in high molecular weight fractions were active. Comprehensive co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed associations of SSs-BEs, and, among BE isozymes, BEIIa-Pho1, and pullulanase-type DBE-BEI interactions. Blue-native-PAGE zymogram analyses confirmed the glucan-synthesizing activity of protein complexes. These results suggest that some rice starch biosynthetic isozymes are physically associated with each other and form active protein complexes. Detailed analyses of these complexes will shed light on the mechanisms controlling the unique branch and cluster structure of amylopectin, and the physicochemical properties of starch.
26024808	Effect of arsenite-oxidizing bacterium B. laterosporus on arsenite toxicity and arsenic translocation in rice seedlings.	2015	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Arsenite [As (III)] oxidation can be accelerated by bacterial catalysis, but the effects of the accelerated oxidation on arsenic toxicity and translocation in rice plants are poorly understood. Herein we investigated how an arsenite-oxidizing bacterium, namely Brevibacillus laterosporus, influences As (III) toxicity and translocation in rice plants. Rice seedlings of four cultivars, namely Guangyou Ming 118 (GM), Teyou Hang II (TH), Shanyou 63 (SY) and Minghui 63 (MH), inoculated with or without the bacterium were grown hydroponically with As (III) to investigate its effects on arsenic toxicity and translocation in the plants. Percentages of As (III) oxidation in the solutions with the bacterium (100%) were all significantly higher than those without (30-72%). The addition of the bacterium significantly decreased As (III) concentrations in SY root, GM root and shoot, while increased the As (III) concentrations in the shoot of SY, MH and TH and in the root of MH. Furthermore, the As (III) concentrations in the root and shoot of SY were both the lowest among the treatments with the bacterium. On the other hand, its addition significantly alleviated the As (III) toxicity on four rice cultivars. Among the treatments amended with B. laterosporus, the bacterium showed the best remediation on SY seedlings, with respect to the subdued As (III) toxicity and decreased As (III) concentration in its roots. These results indicated that As (III) oxidation accelerated by B. laterosporus could be an effective method to alleviate As (III) toxicity on rice seedlings.
26001084	Short-term complete submergence of rice at the tillering stage increases yield.	2015	PLoS One	Flooding is a major threat to agricultural production. Most studies have focused on the lower water storage limit in rice fields, whereas few studies have examined the upper water storage limit. This study aimed to explore the effect of waterlogging at the rice tillering stage on rice growth and yield. The early-ripening late japonica variety Yangjing 4227 was selected for this study. The treatments included different submergence depths (submergence depth/plant height: 1/2 (waist submergence), 2/3 (neck submergence), and 1/1 (complete submergence)) and durations (1, 3, and 5 d). The control group was treated with the conventional alternation of drying and wetting. The effects of waterlogging at the tillering stage on root characteristics, dry matter production, nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation, yield, yield components, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) gene expression were explored. Compared with the control group, the 1/1 group showed significant increases in yield, seed-setting rate, photosynthetically efficient leaf area, and OS-ACS3 gene expression after 1 d of submergence. The grain number per panicle, dry weight of the aboveground and belowground parts, and number of adventitious roots also increased. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the panicle number and nitrogen content; however, no significant correlation was found for phosphorus content. If a decrease in rice yield of less than 10% is acceptable, half, 2/3, and complete submergence of the plants can be performed at the tillering stage for 1-3 d; this treatment will increase the space available for rice field water management/control and will improve rainfall resource utilization.
26074936	Genome-wide identification of microRNAs and their targets in wild type and phyB mutant provides a key link between microRNAs and the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway in rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Phytochrome B (phyB), a member of the phytochrome family in rice, plays important roles in regulating a range of developmental processes and stress responses. However, little information about the mechanisms involved in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway has been reported in rice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) also perform important roles in plant development and stress responses. Thus, it is intriguing to explore the role of miRNAs in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway in rice. In this study, comparative high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis were used to identify candidate miRNAs and their targets that participate in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway. A total of 720 known miRNAs, 704 novel miRNAs and 1957 target genes were identified from the fourth leaves of wild-type (WT) and phyB mutant rice at the five-leaf stage. Among them, 135 miRNAs showed differential expression, suggesting that the expression of these miRNAs is directly or indirectly under the control of phyB. In addition, 32 out of the 135 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to slice 70 genes in the rice genome. Analysis of these target genes showed that members of various transcription factor families constituted the largest proportion, indicating miRNAs are probably involved in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway mainly by regulating the expression of transcription factors. Our results provide new clues for functional characterization of miRNAs in the phyB-mediated light signaling pathway, which should be helpful in comprehensively uncovering the molecular mechanisms of phytochrome-mediated photomorphogenesis and stress responses in plants.
26010143	Effect of GABA Extract of Black Sticky Rice with Giant Embryo on Alcohol-Related Indices After Acute Alcohol Intake in Social Drinkers.	2015	Alcohol Clin Exp Res	BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effect and safety of a high-gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing extract (GABA extract) of black sticky rice with giant embryo (BSRGE) on alcohol-related indices after acute alcohol intake in social drinkers.

METHODS: Subjects were randomized to the GABA extract (G) group, GABA extract and alcohol drinking (GA) group, or placebo intake and alcohol drinking (PA) group in a double-blind design. All subjects were administered GABA extract (200 mg GABA) or placebo at 9 am on study days 2 and 3, respectively. Subjects in the GA and PA groups were administered an equivalent dose of alcohol that was diluted in a drinking beverage for a total amount of 240 ml at 11 am on day 3. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale were measured just before alcohol drinking, and 6 times after alcohol drinking.

RESULTS: The peak and area under the curve (AUC) of the total stimulation scale score after alcohol intake in females were significantly higher in the GA than in the PA group, whereas no significant difference was found between the 2 groups in males. The peak and AUC of the total score on the sedation scale after alcohol intake in males were significantly lower in the GA than in the PA group, whereas both were significantly higher in the GA than in the PA group of females. The AUC for BAC in males was significantly lower in the GA than in the PA group, whereas no significant difference was found in females. No adverse events were reported in any of the groups including the G group.

CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of a GABA extract to social drinkers while drinking alcohol is supposed to affect alcohol-related indices in terms of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and did not induce any adverse events.
26001124	Differential Gene Expression Reflects Morphological Characteristics and Physiological Processes in Rice Immunity against Blast Pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.	2015	PLoS One	The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious pathogen that jeopardises the world's most important food-security crop. Ten common Malaysian rice varieties were examined for their morphological, physiological and genomic responses to this rice blast pathogen. qPCR quantification was used to assess the growth of the pathogen population in resistant and susceptible rice varieties. The chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were also measured to further understand the disruptive effects that M. oryzae has on infected plants of these varieties. Real-time PCR was used to explore the differential expression of eight blast resistance genes among the ten local varieties. Blast disease has destructive effects on the growth of rice, and the findings of our study provide evidence that the Pikh, Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes are involved in defence responses in the leaves of Malaysian rice at 31 h after inoculation with M. oryzae pathotype P7.2. Both the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were reduced, but the levels of Pikh gene expression remained constant in susceptible varieties, with a developed pathogen population and mild or severe symptoms. The Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes, however, were simultaneously upregulated in infected rice plants. Therefore, the presence of the Pikh, Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes in the germplasm is useful for improving the resistance of rice varieties.
25957646	Comparative fine mapping of the Wax 1 (W1) locus in hexaploid wheat.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: By applying comparative genomics analyses, a high-density genetic linkage map of the Wax 1 ( W1 ) locus was constructed as a framework for map-based cloning. Glaucousness is described as the scattering effect of visible light from wax deposited on the cuticle of plant aerial organs. In wheat, the wax on leaves and stems is mainly controlled by two sets of genes: glaucousness loci (W1 and W2) and non-glaucousness loci (Iw1 and Iw2). Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that Wax1 (W1) is located on chromosome arm 2BS between markers Xgwm210 and Xbarc35. By applying comparative genomics analyses, colinearity genomic regions of the W1 locus on wheat 2BS were identified in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 5, rice chromosome 4 and sorghum chromosome 6, respectively. Four STS markers were developed using the Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring 454 contig sequences and the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) survey sequences. W1 was mapped into a 0.93 cM genetic interval flanked by markers XWGGC3197 and XWGGC2484, which has synteny with genomic regions of 56.5 kb in Brachypodium, 390 kb in rice and 31.8 kb in sorghum. The fine genetic map can serve as a framework for chromosome landing, physical mapping and map-based cloning of the W1 in wheat.
25963517	Down-regulation of lipoxygenase gene reduces degradation of carotenoids of golden rice during storage.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of lipoxygenase enzyme activity reduces degradation of carotenoids of bio-fortified rice seeds which would be an effective tool to reduce huge post-harvest and economic losses of bio-fortified rice seeds during storage. Bio-fortified provitamin A-enriched rice line (golden rice) expressing higher amounts of β-carotene in the rice endosperm provides vitamin A for human health. However, it is already reported that degradation of carotenoids during storage is a major problem. The gene responsible for degradation of carotenoids during storage has remained largely unexplored till now. In our previous study, it has been shown that r9-LOX1 gene is responsible for rice seed quality deterioration. In the present study, we attempted to investigate if r9-LOX1 gene has any role in degradation of carotenoids in rice seeds during storage. To establish our hypothesis, the endogenous lipoxygenase (LOX) activity of high-carotenoid golden indica rice seed was silenced by RNAi technology using aleurone layer and embryo-specific Oleosin-18 promoter. To check the storage stability, LOX enzyme down-regulated high-carotenoid T3 transgenic rice seeds were subjected to artificial aging treatment. The results obtained from biochemical assays (MDA, ROS) also indicated that after artificial aging, the deterioration of LOX-RNAi lines was considerably lower compared to β-carotene-enriched transgenic rice which had higher LOX activity in comparison to LOX-RNAi lines. Furthermore, it was also observed by HPLC analysis that down-regulation of LOX gene activity decreases co-oxidation of β-carotene in LOX-RNAi golden rice seeds as compared to the β-carotene-enriched transgenic rice, after artificial aging treatment. Therefore, our study substantially establishes and verifies that LOX is a key enzyme for catalyzing co-oxidation of β-carotene and has a significant role in deterioration of β-carotene levels in the carotenoid-enriched golden rice.
25968601	A collection of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes involved in modification and detoxification of herbicide atrazine in rice (Oryza sativa) plants.	2015	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenases constitute one of the largest families of protein genes involved in plant growth, development and acclimation to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, whether these genes respond to organic toxic compounds and their biological functions for detoxifying toxic compounds such as herbicides in rice are poorly understood. The present study identified 201 genes encoding cytochrome P450s from an atrazine-exposed rice transcriptome through high-throughput sequencing. Of these, 69 cytochrome P450 genes were validated by microarray and some of them were confirmed by real time PCR. Activities of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and p-nitroanisole O-demethylase (PNOD) related to toxicity were determined and significantly induced by atrazine exposure. To dissect the mechanism underlying atrazine modification and detoxification by P450, metabolites (or derivatives) of atrazine in plants were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). Major metabolites comprised desmethylatrazine (DMA), desethylatrazine (DEA), desisopropylatrazine (DIA), hydroxyatrazine (HA), hydroxyethylatrazine (HEA) and hydroxyisopropylatrazine (HIA). All of them were chemically modified by P450s. Furthermore, two specific inhibitors of piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and malathion (MAL) were used to assess the correlation between the P450s activity and rice responses including accumulation of atrazine in tissues, shoot and root growth and detoxification.
25991036	Functional architecture of two exclusively late stage pollen-specific promoters in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Late stage pollen-specific promoters are important tools in crop molecular breeding. Several such promoters, and their functional motifs, have been well characterized in dicotyledonous plants such as tomato and tobacco. However, knowledge about the functional architecture of such promoters is limited in the monocotyledonous plant rice. Here, pollen-late-stage-promoter 1 (PLP1) and pollen-late-stage-promoter 2 (PLP2) were characterized using a stable transformation system in rice. Histochemical staining showed that the two promoters exclusively drive GUS expression in late-stage pollen grains in rice. 5' deletion analysis revealed that four regions, including the -1159 to -720 and the -352 to -156 regions of PLP1 and the -740 to -557 and the -557 to -339 regions of PLP2, are important in maintaining the activity and specificity of these promoters. Motif mutation analysis indicated that 'AGAAA' and 'CAAT' motifs in the -740 to -557 region of PLP2 act as enhancers in the promoter. Gain of function experiments indicated that the novel TA-rich motif 'TACATAA' and 'TATTCAT' in the core region of the PLP1 and PLP2 promoters is necessary, but not sufficient, for pollen-specific expression in rice. Our results provide evidence that the enhancer motif 'AGAAA' is conserved in the pollen-specific promoters of both monocots and eudicots, but that some functional architecture characteristics are different.
26125743	Cloning and functional analysis of the promoter of a maize starch synthase III gene (ZmDULL1).	2015	Genet Mol Res	The ZmDULL1 gene encodes a starch synthase and is a determinant of the structure of endosperm starch in maize (Zea mays L.). However, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanism of the ZmDULL1 gene. In this study, we isolated and characterized the ZmDULL1 promoter (PDULL1), which is the 5' flanking region of ZmDULL1 in maize. Sequence analysis showed that several cis-acting elements important for endosperm expression (GCN4_motif and AACA-element) were located within the promoter. A series of PDULL1 deletion derivatives, PDULL1-1-PDULL1-4, from the translation start code (-1676, -1216, -740, and -343) were fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Each deletion construct was transformed into rice using the Agrobacterium-mediated method, and then GUS activity was measured in transgenic plants. The results showed that PDULL1 was an endosperm-specific promoter. Further analysis showed that the promoter sequence (-343 to -1 base pairs) was sufficient for mediating GUS gene expression in endosperm. These results indicate that the region from -343 to -1 base pairs of PDULL1 is valuable for transgenic rice breeding and genetic engineering studies.
26012494	Cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility gene provides direct evidence for some hybrid rice recently evolving into weedy rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Weedy rice infests paddy fields worldwide at an alarmingly increasing rate. There is substantial evidence indicating that many weedy rice forms originated from or are closely related to cultivated rice. There is suspicion that the outbreak of weedy rice in China may be related to widely grown hybrid rice due to its heterosis and the diversity of its progeny, but this notion remains unsupported by direct evidence. We screened weedy rice accessions by both genetic and molecular marker tests for the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes (Wild abortive, WA, and Boro type, BT) most widely used in the production of indica and japonica three-line hybrid rice as a diagnostic trait of direct parenthood. Sixteen weedy rice accessions of the 358 tested (4.5%) contained the CMS-WA gene; none contained the CMS-BT gene. These 16 accessions represent weedy rices recently evolved from maternal hybrid rice derivatives, given the primarily maternal inheritance of this trait. Our results provide key direct evidence that hybrid rice can be involved in the evolution of some weedy rice accessions, but is not a primary factor in the recent outbreak of weedy rice in China.
25985202	Genome-Wide Analysis of the AP2/ERF Transcription Factors Family and the Expression Patterns of DREB Genes in Moso Bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis).	2015	PLoS One	The AP2/ERF transcription factor family, one of the largest families unique to plants, performs a significant role in terms of regulation of growth and development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is a fast-growing non-timber forest species with the highest ecological, economic and social values of all bamboos in Asia. The draft genome of moso bamboo and the available genomes of other plants provide great opportunities to research global information on the AP2/ERF family in moso bamboo. In total, 116 AP2/ERF transcription factors were identified in moso bamboo. The phylogeny analyses indicated that the 116 AP2/ERF genes could be divided into three subfamilies: AP2, RAV and ERF; and the ERF subfamily genes were divided into 11 groups. The gene structures, exons/introns and conserved motifs of the PeAP2/ERF genes were analyzed. Analysis of the evolutionary patterns and divergence showed the PeAP2/ERF genes underwent a large-scale event around 15 million years ago (MYA) and the division time of AP2/ERF family genes between rice and moso bamboo was 15-23 MYA. We surveyed the putative promoter regions of the PeDREBs and showed that largely stress-related cis-elements existed in these genes. Further analysis of expression patterns of PeDREBs revealed that the most were strongly induced by drought, low-temperature and/or high salinity stresses in roots and, in contrast, most PeDREB genes had negative functions in leaves under the same respective stresses. In this study there were two main interesting points: there were fewer members of the PeDREB subfamily in moso bamboo than in other plants and there were differences in DREB gene expression profiles between leaves and roots triggered in response to abiotic stress. The information produced from this study may be valuable in overcoming challenges in cultivating moso bamboo.
25948705	RNA sequencing and functional analysis implicate the regulatory role of long non-coding RNAs in tomato fruit ripening.	2015	J Exp Bot	Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in model plants, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. However, the presence of lncRNAs and how they function in fleshy fruit ripening are still largely unknown because fleshy fruit ripening is not present in the above model plants. Tomato is the model system for fruit ripening studies due to its dramatic ripening process. To investigate further the role of lncRNAs in fruit ripening, it is necessary and urgent to discover and identify novel lncRNAs and understand the function of lncRNAs in tomato fruit ripening. Here it is reported that 3679 lncRNAs were discovered from wild-type tomato and ripening mutant fruit. The lncRNAs are transcribed from all tomato chromosomes, 85.1% of which came from intergenic regions. Tomato lncRNAs are shorter and have fewer exons than protein-coding genes, a situation reminiscent of lncRNAs from other model plants. It was also observed that 490 lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated in ripening mutant fruits, and 187 lncRNAs were down-regulated, indicating that lncRNAs could be involved in the regulation of fruit ripening. In line with this, silencing of two novel tomato intergenic lncRNAs, lncRNA1459 and lncRNA1840, resulted in an obvious delay of ripening of wild-type fruit. Overall, the results indicated that lncRNAs might be essential regulators of tomato fruit ripening, which sheds new light on the regulation of fruit ripening.
25956882	Multigene manipulation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation increases CO2 fixation and biomass yield in tobacco.	2015	J Exp Bot	Over the next 40 years it has been estimated that a 50% increase in the yield of grain crops such as wheat and rice will be required to meet the food and fuel demands of the increasing world population. Transgenic tobacco plants have been generated with altered combinations of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and the cyanobacterial putative-inorganic carbon transporter B, ictB, of which have all been identified as targets to improve photosynthesis based on empirical studies. It is shown here that increasing the levels of the three proteins individually significantly increases the rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, leaf area, and biomass yield. Furthermore, the daily integrated measurements of photosynthesis showed that mature plants fixed between 12-19% more CO2 than the equivalent wild-type plants. Further enhancement of photosynthesis and yield was observed when sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and ictB were over-expressed together in the same plant. These results demonstrate the potential for the manipulation of photosynthesis, using multigene-stacking approaches, to increase crop yields.
26002971	Evolutionary divergence of the plant elicitor peptides (Peps) and their receptors: interfamily incompatibility of perception but compatibility of downstream signalling.	2015	J Exp Bot	Plant elicitor peptides (Peps) are potent inducers of pattern-triggered immunity and amplify the immune response against diverse pathogens. Peps have been discovered and studied extensively in Arabidopsis and only recently orthologues in maize were also identified and characterized in more detail.Here, the presence of PROPEPs, the Pep precursors, and PEPRs, the Pep receptors, was investigated within the plant kingdom. PROPEPs and PEPRs were identified in most sequenced species of the angiosperms. The conservation and compatibility of the Pep-PEPR-system was analysed by using plants of two distantly related dicot families, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae, and a representative family of monocot plants, the Poaceae. All three plant families contain important crop plants, including maize, rice, tomato, potato, and canola. Peps were not recognized by species outside of their plant family of origin, apparently because of a divergence of the Pep sequences. Three family-specific Pep motifs were defined and the integration of such a motif into the Pep sequence of an unrelated Pep enabled its perception. Transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana with the coding sequences of the AtPEPR1 and ZmPEPR1a led to the recognition of Pep peptides of Brassicaceae or Poaceae origin, respectively, and to the proper activation of downstream signalling. It was concluded that signalling machinery downstream of the PEPRs is highly conserved whereas the leucine-rich repeat domains of the PEPRs co-evolved with the Peps, leading to distinct motifs and, with it, interfamily incompatibility.
26020828	Identification and Characterization of Two Novel DSF-Controlled Virulence-Associated Genes Within the nodB-rhgB Locus of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola Rs105.	2015	Phytopathology	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and X. oryzae pv. oryzae are two pathovars of X. oryzae that cause leaf streak and blight in rice, respectively. These two bacterial pathogens cause different disease symptoms by utilizing different infection sites on rice. Compared with X. oryzae pv. oryzae, the molecular virulence mechanism of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola remains largely unknown. Previously, we identified a unique diffusible signal factor (DSF)-controlled virulence-related gene (hshB) in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola Rs105 located in the nodB-rghB locus, which is absent in X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99(A). In the present study, we identified two additional genes within this locus (hshA and hshC) that were unique to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola Rs105 compared with X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99(A), and we found that the transcription of these genes was regulated by DSF signaling in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. The mutation of these genes impaired the virulence of the wild-type Rs105 when using a low inoculation density of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. In contrast to hshB, the mutation of these genes did not have any visible effect on characterized virulence-related functions, including in vitro growth, extracellular polysaccharide production, extracellular protease activity, and antioxidative ability. However, we found that mutation of hshA or hshC significantly reduced the in planta growth ability and epiphytic survival level of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola cells, which was the probable mechanisms of involvement of these two genes in virulence. Collectively, our studies of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola have identified two novel DSF-controlled virulence-associated genes (hshA and hshC), which will add to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of conserved DSF virulence signaling in Xanthomonas species.
25957114	Fine-mapping and validating qHTSF4.1 to increase spikelet fertility under heat stress at flowering in rice.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: This study fine mapped and validated a QTL on rice chromosome 4 that increases spikelet fertility under high temperature (over 37 °C) at the flowering stage. Climate change has a negative effect on crop production and food security. Understanding the genetic mechanism of heat tolerance and developing heat-tolerant varieties is essential to cope with future global warming. Previously, we reported on a QTL (qHTSF4.1) from an IR64/N22 population responsible for rice spikelet fertility under high-temperature stress at the flowering stage. To further fine map and validate the effect of qHTSF4.1, PCR-based SNP markers were developed and used to genotype BC2F2, BC3F2, BC3F3, and BC5F2 populations from the same cross. The interval of the QTL was narrowed down to about 1.2 Mb; however, further recombination was not identified even with a large BC5F2 population that was subsequently developed and screened. The sequence in the QTL region is highly conserved and a large number of genes in the same gene family were observed to be clustered in the region. The QTL qHTSF4.1 consistently increased spikelet fertility in all of the backcross populations. This was confirmed using 24 rice varieties. Most of the rice varieties with the QTL showed a certain degree of heat tolerance under high-temperature conditions. In a BC5F2 population with clean background of IR64, QTL qHTSF4.1 increased spikelet fertility by about 15%. It could be an important source for enhancing heat tolerance in rice at the flowering stage. PCR-based SNP markers developed in this study can be used for QTL introgression and for pyramiding with other agronomically important QTLs/genes through marker-assisted selection.
25403331	Heat shock factors in carrot: genome-wide identification, classification, and expression profiles response to abiotic stress.	2015	Mol Biol Rep	Heat shock factors (HSFs) play key roles in the response to abiotic stress in eukaryotes. In this study, 35 DcHSFs were identified from carrot (Daucus carota L.) based on the carrot genome database. All 35 DcHSFs were divided into three classes (A, B, and C) according to the structure and phylogenetic relationships of four different plants, namely, Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, Brassica rapa, and Oryza sativa. Comparative analysis of algae, gymnosperms, and angiosperms indicated that the numbers of HSF transcription factors were related to the plant's evolution. The expression profiles of five DcHsf genes (DcHsf 01, DcHsf 02, DcHsf 09, DcHsf 10, and DcHsf 16), which selected from each subfamily (A, B, and C), were detected by quantitative real-time PCR under abiotic stresses (cold, heat, high salinity, and drought) in two carrot cultivars, D. carota L. cvs. Kurodagosun and Junchuanhong. The expression levels of DcHsfs were markedly increased by heat stress, except that of DcHsf 10, which was down regulated. The expression profiles of different DcHsfs in the same class also differed under various stress treatments. The expression profiles of these DcHsfs were also different in tissues of two carrot cultivars. This study is the first to identify and characterize the DcHSF family transcription factors in plants of Apiaceae using whole-genome analysis. The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the DcHSF family transcription factors' structure, function, and evolution in carrot.
25932633	Salt Tolerant and Sensitive Rice Varieties Display Differential Methylome Flexibility under Salt Stress.	2015	PLoS One	DNA methylation has been referred as an important player in plant genomic responses to environmental stresses but correlations between the methylome plasticity and specific traits of interest are still far from being understood. In this study, we inspected global DNA methylation levels in salt tolerant and sensitive rice varieties upon salt stress imposition. Global DNA methylation was quantified using the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) antibody and an ELISA-based technique, which is an affordable and quite pioneer assay in plants, and in situ imaging of methylation sites in interphase nuclei of tissue sections. Variations of global DNA methylation levels in response to salt stress were tissue- and genotype-dependent. We show a connection between a higher ability of DNA methylation adjustment levels and salt stress tolerance. The salt-tolerant rice variety Pokkali was remarkable in its ability to quickly relax DNA methylation in response to salt stress. In spite of the same tendency for reduction of global methylation under salinity, in the salt-sensitive rice variety IR29 such reduction was not statistically supported. In 'Pokkali', the salt stress-induced demethylation may be linked to active demethylation due to increased expression of DNA demethylases under salt stress. In 'IR29', the induction of both DNA demethylases and methyltransferases may explain the lower plasticity of DNA methylation. We further show that mutations for epigenetic regulators affected specific phenotypic parameters related to salinity tolerance, such as the root length and biomass. This work emphasizes the role of differential methylome flexibility between salt tolerant and salt sensitive rice varieties as an important player in salt stress tolerance, reinforcing the need to better understand the connection between epigenetic networks and plant responses to environmental stresses.
25982586	Identification and analysis of novel salt responsive candidate gene based SSRs (cgSSRs) from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Majority of the Asian people depend on rice for nutritional energy. Rice cultivation and yield are severely affected by soil salinity stress worldwide. Marker assisted breeding is a rapid and efficient way to develop improved variety for salinity stress tolerance. Genomic microsatellite markers are an elite group of markers, but there is possible uncertainty of linkage with the important genes. In contrast, there are better possibilities of linkage detection with important genes if SSRs are developed from candidate genes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such report on SSR markers development from candidate gene sequences in rice. So the present study was aimed to identify and analyse SSRs from salt responsive candidate genes of rice.

RESULTS: In the present study, based on the comprehensive literature survey, we selected 220 different salt responsive genes of rice. Out of them, 106 genes were found to contain 180 microsatellite loci with, tri-nucleotide motifs (56%) being most abundant, followed by di-(41%) and tetra nucleotide (2.8%) motifs. Maximum loci were found in the coding sequences (37.2%), followed by in 5'UTR (26%), intron (21.6%) and 3'UTR (15%). For validation, 19 primer sets were evaluated to detect polymorphism in diversity analysis among the two panels consisting of 17 salt tolerant and 17 susceptible rice genotypes. Except one, all primer sets exhibited polymorphic nature with an average of 21.8 alleles/primer and with a mean PIC value of 0.28. Calculated genetic similarity among genotypes was ranged from 19%-89%. The generated dendrogram showed 3 clusters of which one contained entire 17 susceptible genotypes and another two clusters contained all tolerant genotypes.

CONCLUSION: The present study represents the potential of salt responsive candidate gene based SSR (cgSSR) markers to be utilized as novel and remarkable candidate for diversity analysis among rice genotypes differing in salinity response.
25993302	Comparative Analysis of Anther Transcriptome Profiles of Two Different Rice Male Sterile Lines Genotypes under Cold Stress.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Rice is highly sensitive to cold stress during reproductive developmental stages, and little is known about the mechanisms of cold responses in rice anther. Using the HiSeq™ 2000 sequencing platform, the anther transcriptome of photo thermo sensitive genic male sterile lines (PTGMS) rice Y58S and P64S (Pei'ai64S) were analyzed at the fertility sensitive stage under cold stress. Approximately 243 million clean reads were obtained from four libraries and aligned against the oryza indica genome and 1497 and 5652 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in P64S and Y58S, respectively. Both gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted for these DEGs. Functional classification of DEGs was also carried out. The DEGs common to both genotypes were mainly involved in signal transduction, metabolism, transport, and transcriptional regulation. Most of the DEGs were unique for each comparison group. We observed that there were more differentially expressed MYB (Myeloblastosis) and zinc finger family transcription factors and signal transduction components such as calmodulin/calcium dependent protein kinases in the Y58S comparison group. It was also found that ribosome-related DEGs may play key roles in cold stress signal transduction. These results presented here would be particularly useful for further studies on investigating the molecular mechanisms of rice responses to cold stress.
26314143	[Influence of Sulfur on the Formation of Fe-Mn Plaque on Root and Uptake of Cd by Rice (Oryza sativa L.)].	2015	Huan Jing Ke Xue	A pool culture experiment using exogenous Cd-polluted paddy soils was carried out to investigate the influence of different forms of sulfur fertilizers (sulfur and gypsum) on the formation of Fe-Mn plaque on rice root and the uptake of Cd by rice. The results showed that the redox potential ( Eh) was about--200-100 mV, the pH was 6.9-7.9 and the pe + pH was 4-10 in different growth periods of rice. The mass fractions of Fe and Mn plaque on rice root were 5000-13,000 mg · kg(-1) and 170-580 mg · kg(-1), respectively. The high sulfur treatment led to the formation of more Fe plaque than the low sulfur treatment, and the mass fractions of Fe plaque in both treatments were 9400 mg · kg(-1) and 8600 mg · kg(-1) respectively in the boot stage. Contents of Mn plaque, significantly different in the tiller stage by elemental sulfur treatment and gypsum treatment, were 600 mg · kg(-1) and 400 mg · kg(-1), respectively. The elemental S treatment led to the formation of more Mn plaque on rice root than the gypsum treatment. The excessive intake of Fe2+ might be prevented by the formation of the plaque which had little significant influence on the uptake of Mn2+. The mass fractions of Cd adsorbed by rice roots surface plaque were 78.8-131.1 mg · kg(-1) in tiller stage, 16.6-21.1 mg · kg(-1) in boot stage, and 3.0-9.2 mg · kg(-1) in mature stage. The high sulfur treatment led to higher adsorption of Cd by the plaque than the low sulfur treatment in the tiller stage and the boot stage, while opposite result was observed in the mature stage. The values of Cd on the plaque measured by ACA could not truly show its actual contents adsorbed. The mass fractions of Cd in the different parts of rice followed the order of roots > stem leaf > grain. The sulfur fertilizers applied significantly reduced the mass fractions of Cd uptake in different parts of rice, and the elemental sulfur treatment had better effects than the gypsum treatment before the mature stage in roots and stem leaf, and the gypsum sulfur treatment was better for grain. A certain amount of sulfur fertilizers could effectively prevent the migration of Cd from roots to stem and grain. The transfer coefficients of Cd from roots to stem leaf in the elemental sulfur treatment and the gypsum treatment were 0.13 and 0.25 in the boot stage, respectively, and the difference was significant. Elemental sulfur was more effective to prevent the Cd migration from roots to stem leaf, and the gypsum treatment was more active from roots to grain.
26032497	Five pectinase gene expressions highly responding to heat stress in rice floral organs revealed by RNA-seq analysis.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Heat stress hurts rice, and floral organs are mostly sensitive to heat stress. We aimed to unravel molecular responses to heat stress in rice floral organs using Illumina/Solexa sequencing technology for addressing the increasing concern of globle warming. At meiophase of the pollen mother cell (pulvinus flat), the plants were stressed for 3 d at 38 C, and RNA was extracted from the stressed pistil and stamen for RNA-Seq sequencing to build the heat stress transcriptom library. A total of 7178 defferentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal and heat stress libraries were significant, 61% up-regulated and 39% down-regulated. The 7178 DEGs were significantly classified to 34 gene ontology (GO) categories, and 11 of the GO categories were significantly enriched. The GO:0016787 for hydrolase activity of molecular function was mostly enriched with the least probability, and included 11 DEGs named Hy1 - Hy11. Expression levels of five DEGs, Hy4 - Hy6 and Hy9 - Hy10 for starch and sucrose metablism via pectinase, increased 12 - 14 times in response to the heat stress. Further investigation of the five DEGs for pectin metabolism and association with reported heat responsive genes may help develop a molecular strategy to remedy heat damage in rice.
26022253	Quantitative trait locus mapping of deep rooting by linkage and association analysis in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Deep rooting is a very important trait for plants' drought avoidance, and it is usually represented by the ratio of deep rooting (RDR). Three sets of rice populations were used to determine the genetic base for RDR. A linkage mapping population with 180 recombinant inbred lines and an association mapping population containing 237 rice varieties were used to identify genes linked to RDR. Six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of RDR were identified as being located on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Using 1 019 883 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a genome-wide association study of the RDR was performed. Forty-eight significant SNPs of the RDR were identified and formed a clear peak on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a Manhattan plot. Compared with the shallow-rooting group and the whole collection, the deep-rooting group had selective sweep regions on chromosomes 1 and 2, especially in the major QTL region on chromosome 2. Seven of the nine candidate SNPs identified by association mapping were verified in two RDR extreme groups. The findings from this study will be beneficial to rice drought-resistance research and breeding.
26007238	Genome-wide identification and characterization of cystatin family genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSEAGE: 11 Cystatin genes in rice were identified, and their expression patterns were comprehensively analyzed, which reveals multiple roles in both seed development and plant response to environmental variations. Cystatin is a group of small proteins and known to inhibit the activities of cysteine proteases in the papain C1A and legumain C13 peptidase families in plants. Cystatin family genes have only been well characterized recently in a few plant species such as Hordeum vulgare and Nicotiana tabacum, which show their critical roles in programmed cell death and responses to biotic stresses. Up to now, little is known about cystatin family genes and their roles in Oryza sativa, a model plant for cereal biology study. Here, we identified 11 cystatin genes in rice genome. Comprehensive expression profile analysis reveals that cystatin family genes in rice display diverse expression pattern. They are temporally regulated at different developmental stages during the process of seed production and germination. Our experiments also reveal that the majority of cystatin genes are responsive to plant hormones and different environmental cues including cold, drought and other abiotic stresses, while some others are very stable under different stresses, indicating their fundamental roles in normal plant development. In addition, their distribution in rice chromosomes and their evolutionary relation to the members of Cystatin family in A. thaliana and N. tabacum have also been analyzed. These works suggest multiple roles of cystatin family genes in both seed development and plant response to environmental variations.
25976104	Genome-wide identification of MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK gene families and transcriptional profiling analysis during development and stress response in cucumber.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade consists of three types of reversibly phosphorylated kinases, namely, MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK/MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK/MEKK), playing important roles in plant growth, development, and defense response. The MAPK cascade genes have been investigated in detail in model plants, including Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato, but poorly characterized in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), a major popular vegetable in Cucurbitaceae crops, which is highly susceptible to environmental stress and pathogen attack.

RESULTS: A genome-wide analysis revealed the presence of at least 14 MAPKs, 6 MAPKKs, and 59 MAPKKKs in the cucumber genome. Phylogenetic analyses classified all the CsMAPK and CsMAPKK genes into four groups, whereas the CsMAPKKK genes were grouped into the MEKK, RAF, and ZIK subfamilies. The expansion of these three gene families was mainly contributed by segmental duplication events. Furthermore, the ratios of non-synonymous substitution rates (Ka) and synonymous substitution rates (Ks) implied that the duplicated gene pairs had experienced strong purifying selection. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that some MAPK, MAPKK and MAPKKK genes are preferentially expressed in specific organs or tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of most of these genes significantly changed under heat, cold, drought, and Pseudoperonospora cubensis treatments. Exposure to abscisic acid and jasmonic acid markedly affected the expression levels of these genes, thereby implying that they may play important roles in the plant hormone network.

CONCLUSION: A comprehensive genome-wide analysis of gene structure, chromosomal distribution, and evolutionary relationship of MAPK cascade genes in cucumber are present here. Further expression analysis revealed that these genes were involved in important signaling pathways for biotic and abiotic stress responses in cucumber, as well as the response to plant hormones. Our first systematic description of the MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK families in cucumber will help to elucidate their biological roles in plant.
25969556	The genetics of rhizosheath size in a multiparent mapping population of wheat.	2015	J Exp Bot	Rhizosheaths comprise soil that adheres to plant roots and, in some species, are indicative of root hair length. In this study, the genetics of rhizosheath size in wheat was investigated by screening the progeny of multiparent advanced generation intercrosses (MAGIC). Two MAGIC populations were screened for rhizosheath size using a high throughput method. One MAGIC population was developed from intercrosses between four parents (4-way) and the other from intercrosses between eight parents (8-way). Transgressive segregation for rhizosheath size was observed in both the 4-way and 8-way MAGIC populations. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the 4-way population identified six major loci located on chromosomes 2B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7A together accounting for 42% of the variation in rhizosheath size. Rhizosheath size was strongly correlated with root hair length and was robust across different soil types in the absence of chemical constraints. Rhizosheath size in the MAGIC populations was a reliable surrogate for root hair length and, therefore, the QTL identified probably control root hair elongation. Members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors have previously been identified to regulate root hair length in Arabidopsis and rice. Since several wheat members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of genes are located within or near the QTL, these genes are candidates for controlling the long root hair trait. The QTL for rhizosheath size identified in this study provides the opportunity to implement marker-assisted selection to increase root hair length for improved phosphate acquisition in wheat.
26024443	Brome mosaic virus Infection of Rice Results in Decreased Accumulation of RNA1.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Brome mosaic virus (BMV) (the Russian strain) infects monocot plants and has been studied extensively in barley and wheat. Here, we report BMV can systemically infect rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica), including cultivars in which the genomes have been determined. The BMV capsid protein can be found throughout the inoculated plants. However, infection in rice exhibits delayed symptom expression or no symptoms when compared with wheat (Triticum aestivum). The sequences of BMV RNAs isolated from rice did not reveal any nucleotide changes in RNA1 or RNA2, while RNA3 had only one synonymous nucleotide change from the inoculum sequence. Preparations of purified BMV virions contained RNA1 at a significantly reduced level relative to the other two RNAs. Analysis of BMV RNA replication in rice revealed that minus-strand RNA1 was replicated at a reduced rate when compared with RNA2. Thus, rice appears to either inhibit RNA1 replication or lacks a sufficient amount of a factor needed to support efficient RNA1 replication.
26074937	Genetic variation in Southern USA rice genotypes for seedling salinity tolerance.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The success of a rice breeding program in developing salt tolerant varieties depends on genetic variation and the salt stress response of adapted and donor rice germplasm. In this study, we used a combination of morphological and physiological traits in multivariate analyses to elucidate the phenotypic and genetic variation in salinity tolerance of 30 Southern USA rice genotypes, along with 19 donor genotypes with varying degree of tolerance. Significant genotypic variation and correlations were found among the salt injury score (SIS), ion leakage, chlorophyll reduction, shoot length reduction, shoot K(+) concentration, and shoot Na(+)/K(+) ratio. Using these parameters, the combined methods of cluster analysis and discriminant analysis validated the salinity response of known genotypes and classified most of the USA varieties into sensitive groups, except for three and seven varieties placed in the tolerant and moderately tolerant groups, respectively. Discriminant function and MANOVA delineated the differences in tolerance and suggested no differences between sensitive and highly sensitive (HS) groups. DNA profiling using simple sequence repeat markers showed narrow genetic diversity among USA genotypes. However, the overall genetic clustering was mostly due to subspecies and grain type differentiation and not by varietal grouping based on salinity tolerance. Among the donor genotypes, Nona Bokra, Pokkali, and its derived breeding lines remained the donors of choice for improving salinity tolerance during the seedling stage. However, due to undesirable agronomic attributes and photosensitivity of these donors, alternative genotypes such as TCCP266, Geumgangbyeo, and R609 are recommended as useful and novel sources of salinity tolerance for USA rice breeding programs.
26089150	Genome-wide analysis of SnRK gene family in Brachypodium distachyon and functional characterization of BdSnRK2.9.	2015	Plant Sci	The sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinases (SnRKs) play key roles in plant signaling pathways including responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Although SnRKs have been systematically studied in Arabidopsis and rice, there is no information concerning SnRKs in the new Poaceae model plant Brachypodium distachyon. In the present study, a total of 44 BdSnRKs were identified and classified into three subfamilies, including three members of BdSnRK1, 10 of BdSnRK2 and 31 of BdSnRK3 (CIPK) subfamilies. Phylogenetic reconstruction, chromosome distribution and synteny analyses suggested that BdSnRK family had been established before the dicot-monocot lineage parted, and had experienced rapid expansion during the process of plant evolution since then. Expression analysis of the BdSnRK2 subfamily showed that the majority of them could respond to abiotic stress and related signal molecules treatments. Protein-protein interaction and co-expression analyses of BdSnRK2s network showed that SnRK2s might be involved in biological pathway different from that of dicot model plant Arabidopsis. Expression of BdSnRK2.9 in tobacco resulted in increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses through activation of NtABF2. Taken together, comprehensive analyses of BdSnRKs would provide a basis for understanding of evolution and function of BdSnRK family.
26058145	Momilactone sensitive proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2015	Nat Prod Commun	The labdane-related diterpenoid, momilactone B has potent growth inhibitory activity and was demonstrated to play a particularly critical role in the allelopathy of rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, there is limited information available about the mode of action of momilactone B on the growth inhibition. The present research describes the effects of momilactone B on protein expression in the early development of Arabidopsis thaliana seedling, which was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOFMS. Momilactone B inhibited the accumulation of subtilisin-like serine protease, amyrin synthase LUP2, β-glucosidase and malate synthase at 1 h after the momilactone application. Those proteins are involved in the metabolic turnover and the production of intermediates needed for cell structures resulting in plant growth and development. Momilactone B also inhibited the breakdown of cruciferin 2, which is essential for seed germination and seedling growth to construct cell structures. Momilactone B induced the accumulation of translationally controlled tumor protein, glutathione S-transferase and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin 1. These proteins are involved in stress responses and increased stress tolerance. In addition, glutathione S-transferase has the activity of herbicide detoxification and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin 1 has inhibitory activity for seed germination under unfavorable conditions. The present research suggests that momilactone B may inhibit the seedling growth by the inhibition of the metabolic turnover and the production of intermediates for cell structures. In addition, momilactone induced proteins associated with plant defense responses.
26068787	Whole genome sequencing and analysis of Swarna, a widely cultivated indica rice variety with low glycemic index.	2015	Sci Rep	Swarna is a popular cultivated indica rice variety with low glycemic index (GI) but its genetic basis is not known. The whole genome of Swarna was sequenced using Illumina's paired-end technology, and the reads were mapped to the Nipponbare reference genome. Overall, 65,984 non-synonymous SNPs were identified in 20,350 genes, and in silico analysis predicted that 4,847 of them in 2,214 genes may have deleterious effect on protein functions. Polymorphisms were found in all the starch biosynthesis genes, except the gene for branching enzyme IIa. It was found that T/G SNP at position 246, 'A' at position 2,386, and 'C' at position 3,378 in the granule bound starch synthase I gene, and C/T SNP at position 1,188 in the glucose-6-phosphate translocator gene may contribute to the low GI phenotype in Swarna. All these variants were also found in the genome of another low GI indica rice variety from Columbia, Fedearroz 50. The whole genome analysis of Swarna helped to understand the genetic basis of GI in rice, which is a complex trait involving multiple factors.
26116860	Parallel Domestication of the Heading Date 1 Gene in Cereals.	2015	Mol Biol Evol	Flowering time is one of the key determinants of crop adaptation to local environments during domestication. However, the genetic basis underlying flowering time is yet to be elucidated in most cereals. Although staple cereals, such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum, have spread and adapted to a wide range of ecological environments during domestication, it is yet to be determined whether they have a common genetic basis for flowering time. In this study, we show, through map-based cloning, that flowering time in sorghum is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading Date 1 (HD1), located on chromosome 10. The causal gene encodes the CONSTANS gene family which contains a CCT domain. A 5-bp deletion of a minor allele present in the coding sequence leads to a gene frameshift that delays flowering in sorghum. In contrast, in foxtail millet, association mapping of HD1 showed a common causal site with a splicing variant from "GT" to "AT" that was highly correlated with flowering time. In addition, the rice HD1 gene is known to harbor several causal variants controlling flowering time. These data indicate that the major flowering time QTL HD1 was under parallel domestication in sorghum, foxtail millet, and rice. The pattern of common mixed minor, or even rare, causal alleles in HD1 across different species may be representative of the genetic basis of the domestication syndrome. Furthermore, large DNA sequence analysis of HD1 revealed multiple origins for domesticated sorghum and a single origin for domesticated foxtail millet.
26095078	Dormancy and germination: How does the crop seed decide?	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Whether seeds germinate or maintain dormancy is decided upon through very intricate physiological processes. Correct timing of these processes is most important for the plants life cycle. If moist conditions are encountered, a low dormancy level causes pre-harvest sprouting in various crop species, such as wheat, corn and rice, this decreases crop yield and negatively impacts downstream industrial processing. In contrast, a deep level of seed dormancy prevents normal germination even under favourable conditions, resulting in a low emergence rate during agricultural production. Therefore, an optimal seed dormancy level is valuable for modern mechanised agricultural systems. Over the past several years, numerous studies have demonstrated that diverse endogenous and environmental factors regulate the balance between dormancy and germination, such as light, temperature, water status and bacteria in soil, and phytohormones such as ABA (abscisic acid) and GA (gibberellic acid). In this updated review, we highlight recent advances regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of seed dormancy and germination processes, including the external environmental and internal hormonal cues, and primarily focusing on the staple crop species. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for developing a full understanding of crop seed dormancy and germination are also discussed.
26052925	Outcrossing potential between 11 important genetically modified crops and the Chilean vascular flora.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	The potential impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on biodiversity is one of the main concerns in an environmental risk assessment (ERA). The likelihood of outcrossing and pollen-mediated gene flow from GM crops and non-GM crops are explained by the same principles and depend primarily on the biology of the species. We conducted a national-scale study of the likelihood of outcrossing between 11 GM crops and vascular plants in Chile by use of a systematized database that included cultivated, introduced and native plant species in Chile. The database included geographical distributions and key biological and agronomical characteristics for 3505 introduced, 4993 native and 257 cultivated (of which 11 were native and 246 were introduced) plant species. Out of the considered GM crops (cotton, soya bean, maize, grape, wheat, rice, sugar beet, alfalfa, canola, tomato and potato), only potato and tomato presented native relatives (66 species total). Introduced relative species showed that three GM groups were formed having: a) up to one introduced relative (cotton and soya bean), b) up to two (rice, grape, maize and wheat) and c) from two to seven (sugar beet, alfalfa, canola, tomato and potato). In particular, GM crops presenting introduced noncultivated relative species were canola (1 relative species), alfalfa (up to 4), rice (1), tomato (up to 2) and potato (up to 2). The outcrossing potential between species [OP; scaled from 'very low' (1) to 'very high' (5)] was developed, showing medium OPs (3) for GM-native relative interactions when they occurred, low (2) for GMs and introduced noncultivated and high (4) for the grape-Vitis vinifera GM-introduced cultivated interaction. This analytical tool might be useful for future ERA for unconfined GM crop release in Chile.
26046301	Rice potassium transporter OsHAK1 is essential for maintaining potassium-mediated growth and functions in salt tolerance over low and high potassium concentration ranges.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Potassium (K) absorption and translocation in plants rely upon multiple K transporters for adapting varied K supply and saline conditions. Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to the KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot. Both oshak1 knockout mutants in comparison to their respective Dongjin or Manan wild types showed a dramatic reduction in K concentration and stunted root and shoot growth. Knockout of OsHAK1 reduced the K absorption rate of unit root surface area by ∼50-55 and ∼30%, and total K uptake by ∼80 and ∼65% at 0.05-0.1 and 1 mm K supply level, respectively. The root net high-affinity K uptake of oshak1 mutants was sensitive to salt stress but not to ammonium supply. Overexpression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio. The positive relationship between K concentration and shoot biomass in the mutants suggests that OsHAK1 plays an essential role in K-mediated rice growth and salt tolerance over low and high K concentration ranges.
26111882	Single-copy gene based 50 K SNP chip for genetic studies and molecular breeding in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most abundant DNA sequence variation present in plant genomes. Here, we report the design and validation of a unique genic-SNP genotyping chip for genetic and evolutionary studies as well as molecular breeding applications in rice. The chip incorporates 50,051 SNPs from 18,980 different genes spanning 12 rice chromosomes, including 3,710 single-copy (SC) genes conserved between wheat and rice, 14,959 SC genes unique to rice, 194 agronomically important cloned rice genes and 117 multi-copy rice genes. Assays with this chip showed high success rate and reproducibility because of the SC gene based array with no sequence redundancy and cross-hybridisation problems. The usefulness of the chip in genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies of cultivated and wild rice germplasm was demonstrated. Furthermore, its efficacy was validated for analysing background recovery in improved mega rice varieties with submergence tolerance developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding.
26123290	The promoter of the AlSAP gene from the halophyte grass Aeluropus littoralis directs a stress-inducible expression pattern in transgenic rice plants.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: When fused to " Pr AlSAP " promoter, transcripts of gusA exhibited similar accumulation patterns in transgenic rice as AlSAP transcripts in A. littoralis. Pr AlSAP can be used for engineering abiotic stress tolerance. We previously showed that ectopic expression of a stress-associated protein gene from Aeluropus littoralis (AlSAP) enhances tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in tobacco, wheat and rice. The ortholog of AlSAP in rice is OsSAP9. Here, we demonstrate that AlSAP transcripts accumulate in Aeleuropus in response to multiple abiotic stresses and at a higher level in roots, while those of OsSAP9 are preferentially induced by cold and heat treatments and accumulate preferentially in leaves of rice. In silico analysis of the AlSAP promoter "Pr AlSAP " predicted several cis-acting elements responsible for gene regulation by dehydration, salt, heat, ABA, SA, wounding and tissue-specific expression. The Pr AlSAP promoter was fused to the gusA gene and used to produce transgenic rice plants. Transcripts of gusA exhibited similar accumulation patterns in transgenic rice as AlSAP transcripts in A. littoralis. Indeed, accumulation of gusA transcripts was higher in roots than in leaves and induced by salt, drought, cold and heat treatments. GUS activity was confirmed in roots, coleoptiles, leaves and glumes, but absent in the root cell elongation zone and in dry seeds. A wound treatment strongly induced GUS accumulation in leaves and imbibed seeds. Altogether, these results indicate that the regulatory regions of two ortholog genes "AlSAP" and "OsSAP9" have diverged in the specificity of the signals promoting their induction, but that the trans-acting elements allowing the correct spatiotemporal regulation and stress induction of Pr AlSAP exist in rice. Therefore, the AlSAP promoter appears to be an interesting candidate for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in cereals.
26044828	Heterologous expression and transcript analysis of gibberellin biosynthetic genes of grasses reveals novel functionality in the GA3ox family.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The gibberellin (GA) pathway plays a central role in the regulation of plant development, with the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs: GA20ox, GA3ox, GA2ox) that catalyse the later steps in the biosynthetic pathway of particularly importance in regulating bioactive GA levels. Although GA has important impacts on crop yield and quality, our understanding of the regulation of GA biosynthesis during wheat and barley development remains limited. In this study we identified or assembled genes encoding the GA 2-ODDs of wheat, barley and Brachypodium distachyon and characterised the wheat genes by heterologous expression and transcript analysis.

RESULTS: The wheat, barley and Brachypodium genomes each contain orthologous copies of the GA20ox, GA3ox and GA2ox genes identified in rice, with the exception of OsGA3ox1 and OsGA2ox5 which are absent in these species. Some additional paralogs of 2-ODD genes were identified: notably, a novel gene in the wheat B genome related to GA3ox2 was shown to encode a GA 1-oxidase, named as TaGA1ox-B1. This enzyme is likely to be responsible for the abundant 1β-hydroxylated GAs present in developing wheat grains. We also identified a related gene in barley, located in a syntenic position to TaGA1ox-B1, that encodes a GA 3,18-dihydroxylase which similarly accounts for the accumulation of unusual GAs in barley grains. Transcript analysis showed that some paralogs of the different classes of 2-ODD were expressed mainly in a single tissue or at specific developmental stages. In particular, TaGA20ox3, TaGA1ox1, TaGA3ox3 and TaGA2ox7 were predominantly expressed in developing grain. More detailed analysis of grain-specific gene expression showed that while the transcripts of biosynthetic genes were most abundant in the endosperm, genes encoding inactivation and signalling components were more highly expressed in the seed coat and pericarp.

CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive expression and functional characterisation of the multigene families encoding the 2-ODD enzymes of the GA pathway in wheat and barley will provide the basis for a better understanding of GA-regulated development in these species. This analysis revealed the existence of a novel, endosperm-specific GA 1-oxidase in wheat and a related GA 3,18-dihydroxylase enzyme in barley that may play important roles during grain expansion and development.
26076132	Transcriptional Slippage and RNA Editing Increase the Diversity of Transcripts in Chloroplasts: Insight from Deep Sequencing of Vigna radiata Genome and Transcriptome.	2015	PLoS One	We performed deep sequencing of the nuclear and organellar genomes of three mungbean genotypes: Vigna radiata ssp. sublobata TC1966, V. radiata var. radiata NM92 and the recombinant inbred line RIL59 derived from a cross between TC1966 and NM92. Moreover, we performed deep sequencing of the RIL59 transcriptome to investigate transcript variability. The mungbean chloroplast genome has a quadripartite structure including a pair of inverted repeats separated by two single copy regions. A total of 213 simple sequence repeats were identified in the chloroplast genomes of NM92 and RIL59; 78 single nucleotide variants and nine indels were discovered in comparing the chloroplast genomes of TC1966 and NM92. Analysis of the mungbean chloroplast transcriptome revealed mRNAs that were affected by transcriptional slippage and RNA editing. Transcriptional slippage frequency was positively correlated with the length of simple sequence repeats of the mungbean chloroplast genome (R2=0.9911). In total, 41 C-to-U editing sites were found in 23 chloroplast genes and in one intergenic spacer. No editing site that swapped U to C was found. A combination of bioinformatics and experimental methods revealed that the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-transcribed genes psbF and ndhA are affected by transcriptional slippage in mungbean and in main lineages of land plants, including three dicots (Glycine max, Brassica rapa, and Nicotiana tabacum), two monocots (Oryza sativa and Zea mays), two gymnosperms (Pinus taeda and Ginkgo biloba) and one moss (Physcomitrella patens). Transcript analysis of the rps2 gene showed that transcriptional slippage could affect transcripts at single sequence repeat regions with poly-A runs. It showed that transcriptional slippage together with incomplete RNA editing may cause sequence diversity of transcripts in chloroplasts of land plants.
26175615	Detection and characterization of epistasis between QTLs on plant height in rice using single segment substitution lines.	2015	Breed Sci	Hua-jing-xian 74 and its 12 single segment substitution lines (SSSLs) in rice were used as crossing parents to construct a half diallel crossing population. A total number of 91 materials were grown under three planting densities. By analysis of average plant height (PH) over all environments 10 SSSLs were detected with significant additives and 6 SSSLs with significant dominances. These SSSLs were further tested under different densities respectively, indicating that some of single locus effects were sensitive to densities and the conditions under the density of 16.7 cm × 16.7 cm maybe inhibited the expressing of these PH QTLs. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of each four participating genotypes indicated that digenic interactions among these QTLs were prevalent. Of 66 tested interactions, about 42.4% were epistatic (P < 5%). Although some QTLs hadn't single locus effects, they were possible to form digenic interactions. A significant finding was that the detected epistases were mostly negative. Additionally, these epistases were also found being sensitive to planting densities, the conditions under the density of 10 cm × 16.7 cm perhaps promoted the expressing of epistatic interactions among PH QTLs.
25457483	Anti-inflammatory activity on mice of extract of Ganoderma lucidum grown on rice via modulation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways.	2015	Phytochemistry	Ganoderma lucidum is a popular medicinal mushroom with anti-inflammatory potential. In the present study, the aim was to determine the anti-inflammatory effect and mode of action of G. lucidum grown on germinated brown rice (GLBR) in a mouse model of colitis. It was shown that GLBR suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and decreased the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNAs. GLBR also inhibited activation of p38, ERK, JNK, MAPKs, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). In a mouse model of colitis, colonic mucosal injury was evaluated using macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological testing. Disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic score, and histological score significantly decreased upon GLBR treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies indicated that DSS activates nuclear translocation of NF-κB in colon tissue, which is attenuated by GLBR extract. These findings suggest that GLBR is protective against colitis via inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation.
26141377	Electron self-exchange in hemoglobins revealed by deutero-hemin substitution.	2015	J Inorg Biochem	Hemoglobins (phytoglobins) from rice plants (nsHb1) and from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (PCC 6803) (SynHb) can reduce hydroxylamine with two electrons to form ammonium. The reaction requires intermolecular electron transfer between protein molecules, and rapid electron self-exchange might play a role in distinguishing these hemoglobins from others with slower reaction rates, such as myoglobin. A relatively rapid electron self-exchange rate constant has been measured for SynHb by NMR, but the rate constant for myoglobin is equivocal and a value for nsHb1 has not yet been measured. Here we report electron self-exchange rate constants for nsHb1 and Mb as a test of their role in hydroxylamine reduction. These proteins are not suitable for analysis by NMR ZZ exchange, so a method was developed that uses cross-reactions between each hemoglobin and its deutero-hemin substituted counterpart. The resulting electron transfer is between identical proteins with low driving forces and thus closely approximates true electron self-exchange. The reactions can be monitored spectrally due to the distinct spectra of the prosthetic groups, and from this electron self-exchange rate constants of 880 (SynHb), 2900 (nsHb1), and 0.05M(-1) s(-1) (Mb) have been measured for each hemoglobin. Calculations of cross-reactions using these values accurately predict hydroxylamine reduction rates for each protein, suggesting that electron self-exchange plays an important role in the reaction.
26036614	Ethylene Biosynthesis Is Promoted by Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation in Rice Roots.	2015	Plant Physiol	In rice (Oryza sativa) roots, lysigenous aerenchyma, which is created by programmed cell death and lysis of cortical cells, is constitutively formed under aerobic conditions, and its formation is further induced under oxygen-deficient conditions. Ethylene is involved in the induction of aerenchyma formation. reduced culm number1 (rcn1) is a rice mutant in which the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter RCN1/OsABCG5 is defective. Here, we report that the induction of aerenchyma formation was reduced in roots of rcn1 grown in stagnant deoxygenated nutrient solution (i.e. under stagnant conditions, which mimic oxygen-deficient conditions in waterlogged soils). 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) is a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. Stagnant conditions hardly induced the expression of ACS1 in rcn1 roots, resulting in low ethylene production in the roots. Accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of 24, 26, and 28 carbons was reduced in rcn1 roots. Exogenously supplied VLCFA (26 carbons) increased the expression level of ACS1 and induced aerenchyma formation in rcn1 roots. Moreover, in rice lines in which the gene encoding a fatty acid elongase, CUT1-LIKE (CUT1L; a homolog of the gene encoding Arabidopsis CUT1, which is required for cuticular wax production), was silenced, both ACS1 expression and aerenchyma formation were reduced. Interestingly, the expression of ACS1, CUT1L, and RCN1/OsABCG5 was induced predominantly in the outer part of roots under stagnant conditions. These results suggest that, in rice under oxygen-deficient conditions, VLCFAs increase ethylene production by promoting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in the outer part of roots, which, in turn, induces aerenchyma formation in the root cortex.
26031196	More than one way to evolve a weed: parallel evolution of US weedy rice through independent genetic mechanisms.	2015	Mol Ecol	Many different crop species were selected for a common suite of 'domestication traits', which facilitates their use for studies of parallel evolution. Within domesticated rice (Oryza sativa), there has also been independent evolution of weedy strains from different cultivated varieties. This makes it possible to examine the genetic basis of parallel weed evolution and the extent to which this process occurs through shared genetic mechanisms. We performed comparative QTL mapping of weediness traits using two recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between an indica crop variety and representatives of each of the two independently evolved weed strains found in US rice fields, strawhull (S) and blackhull awned (B). Genotyping-by-sequencing provided dense marker coverage for linkage map construction (average marker interval <0.25 cM), with 6016 and 13 730 SNPs mapped in F5 lines of the S and B populations, respectively. For some weediness traits (awn length, hull pigmentation and pericarp pigmentation), QTL mapping and sequencing of underlying candidate genes confirmed that trait variation was largely attributable to individual loci. However, for more complex quantitative traits (including heading date, panicle length and seed shattering), we found multiple QTL, with little evidence of shared genetic bases between the S and B populations or across previous studies of weedy rice. Candidate gene sequencing revealed causal genetic bases for 8 of 27 total mapped QTL. Together these findings suggest that despite the genetic bottleneck that occurred during rice domestication, there is ample genetic variation in this crop to allow agricultural weed evolution through multiple genetic mechanisms.
26082161	Improved understanding of rice amylose biosynthesis from advanced starch structural characterization.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: It has been shown from the chain length distributions (CLDs) that amylose chains can be divided into at least two groups: long and short amylose chains. These molecular structures influence some functional properties of starch, such as digestibility and mouth-feel. GBSSI is the key enzyme for the elongation of amylose chains; however, the effect of other starch biosynthesis enzymes in amylose synthesis is still not fully understood. Two advanced starch characterization techniques, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorophore-assissted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), together with a newly developed starch biosynthesis model, are used to improve understanding of amylose biosynthesis.

RESULTS: SEC and FACE were used to determine the CLD of amylose and amylopectin in various native and mutant rice starches. The types of starch branching enzymes (SBEs) involved in the synthesis of the distinct features seen for shorter degrees of polymerization, DP, < 2000, and longer (DP > 2000) amylose chains are identified by combining these data with a mathematical model of amylopectin biosynthesis. The model enables each feature in the amylopectin CLD to be parameterized in terms of relative SBE activities, which are used to explain differences in the genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that while GBSSI is the predominant enzyme controlling the synthesis of longer amylose chains, some branching enzymes (such as BEI and BEIIb) also play important roles in the synthesis of shorter amylose chains.
26110263	Post-Heading Heat Stress in Rice of South China during 1981-2010.	2015	PLoS One	Frequent extreme heat events are the serious threat to rice production, but the historical trend of heat stress associated with phenology shift and its impact on rice yield over a long period are poorly known. Based on the analysis of observed climate and phenology data from 228 stations in South China during 1981-2010, the spatio-temporal variation of post-heading heat stress was investigated among two single-season rice sub-regions in the northern Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River (S-NMLYtz) and Southwest Plateau (S-SWP), and two double-season early rice sub-regions in the southern Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River (DE-SMLYtz) and Southern China (DE-SC). Post-heading heat stress was more severe in DE-SMLYtz, west S-NMLYtz and east S-SWP than elsewhere, because of rice exposure to the hot season during post-heading stage. The spatial variation of post-heading heat stress was greater in single-season rice region than in double-season early rice region due to the greater spatial variation of heading and maturity dates. Post-heading heat stress increased from 1981 to 2010 in most areas, with significant increases in the east of double-season early rice region and west S-SWP. Phenology shift during 1981-2010 mitigated the increasing trends of heat stress in most areas, but not in west S-SWP. Post-heading heat stress played a dominated role in the reduction of rice yield in South China. Grain yield was more sensitive to post-heading heat stress in double-season early rice region than that in single-season rice region. Rice yield decreased by 1.5%, 6.2%, 9.7% and 4.6% in S-NMLYtz, S-SWP, DE-SMLYtz and DE-SC, respectively, because of post-heading heat stress during 1981-2010, although there were some uncertainties. Given the current level and potential increase of post-heading heat stress in South China, the specific adaptation or mitigation strategies are necessary for different sub-regions to stabilize rice production under heat stress.
26030358	Combination Patterns of Major R Genes Determine the Level of Resistance to the M. oryzae in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease of rice and poses a serious threat to world food security. In this study, the distribution and effectiveness of 18 R genes in 277 accessions were investigated based on pathogenicity assays and molecular markers. The results showed that most of the accessions exhibited some degree of resistance (resistance frequency, RF >50%). Accordingly, most of the accessions were observed to harbor two or more R genes, and the number of R genes harbored in accessions was significantly positively correlated with RF. Some R genes were demonstrated to be specifically distributed in the genomes of rice sub-species, such as Pigm, Pi9, Pi5 and Pi1, which were only detected in indica-type accessions, and Pik and Piz, which were just harbored in japonica-type accessions. By analyzing the relationship between R genes and RF using a multiple stepwise regression model, the R genes Pid3, Pi5, Pi9, Pi54, Pigm and Pit were found to show the main effects against M. oryzae in indica-type accessions, while Pita, Pb1, Pik, Pizt and Pia were indicated to exhibit the main effects against M. oryzae in japonica-type accessions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis revealed that combination patterns of major R genes were the main factors determining the resistance of rice varieties to M. oryzae, such as 'Pi9+Pi54', 'Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pi54+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3' and 'Pi5+Pit+Pid3' in indica-type accessions and 'Pik+Pib', 'Pik+Pita', 'Pik+Pb1', 'Pizt+Pia' and 'Pizt+Pita' in japonica-type accessions, which were able to confer effective resistance against M. oryzae. The above results provide good theoretical support for the rational utilization of combinations of major R genes in developing rice cultivars with broad-spectrum resistance.
26047696	ABA-induced CCCH tandem zinc finger protein OsC3H47 decreases ABA sensitivity and promotes drought tolerance in Oryza sativa.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Water deficit causes multiple negative impacts on plants, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, abscisic acid (ABA) induction, stomatal closure, and decreased photosynthesis. Here, we characterized OsC3H47, which belongs to CCCH zinc-finger families, as a drought-stress response gene. It can be strongly induced by NaCl, PEG, ABA, and drought conditions. Overexpression of OsC3H47 significantly enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses in rice seedlings, which indicates that OsC3H47 plays important roles in post-stress recovery. However, overexpression of OsC3H47 reduced the ABA sensitivity of rice seedlings. This suggests that OsC3H47 is a newly discovered gene that can control rice drought-stress response, and it may play an important role in ABA feedback and post-transcription processes.
26034131	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	2015	J Exp Bot	RAD51 paralogues play important roles in the assembly and stabilization of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, which promote homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions in organisms ranging from yeast to vertebrates. XRCC3, a RAD51 paralogue, has been characterized in budding yeast, mouse, and Arabidopsis. In the present study, XRCC3 in rice was identified and characterized. The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility. Cytological investigations revealed that homologous pairing and synapsis were severely disrupted in the mutant. Meiotic chromosomes were frequently entangled from diplotene to metaphase I, resulting in chromosome fragmentation at anaphase I. The immunostaining signals from γH2AX were regular, implying that double-strand break (DSB) formation was normal in xrcc3 meiocytes. However, COM1 was not detected on early prophase I chromosomes, suggesting that the DSB end-processing system was destroyed in the mutant. Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3. Taken together, the results suggest that XRCC3 plays critical roles in both DSB repair and homologous chromosome recombination during rice meiosis.
26109439	Function and evolution of Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPib responding to the rice blast resistance gene Pib.	2015	Sci Rep	Magnaporthe oryzae (Mo) is the causative pathogen of the damaging disease rice blast. The effector gene AvrPib, which confers avirulence to host carrying resistance gene Pib, was isolated via map-based cloning. The gene encodes a 75-residue protein, which includes a signal peptide. Phenotyping and genotyping of 60 isolates from each of five geographically distinct Mo populations revealed that the frequency of virulent isolates, as well as the sequence diversity within the AvrPib gene increased from a low level in the far northeastern region of China to a much higher one in the southern region, indicating a process of host-driven selection. Resequencing of the AvrPiballele harbored by a set of 108 diverse isolates revealed that there were four pathoways, transposable element (TE) insertion (frequency 81.7%), segmental deletion (11.1%), complete absence (6.7%), and point mutation (0.6%), leading to loss of the avirulence function. The lack of any TE insertion in a sample of non-rice infecting Moisolates suggested that it occurred after the host specialization of Mo. Both the deletions and the functional point mutation were confined to the signal peptide. The reconstruction of 16 alleles confirmed seven functional nucleotide polymorphisms for the AvrPiballeles, which generated three distinct expression profiles.
26111541	Integrating Image-Based Phenomics and Association Analysis to Dissect the Genetic Architecture of Temporal Salinity Responses in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Salinity affects a significant portion of arable land and is particularly detrimental for irrigated agriculture, which provides one-third of the global food supply. Rice (Oryza sativa), the most important food crop, is salt sensitive. The genetic resources for salt tolerance in rice germplasm exist but are underutilized due to the difficulty in capturing the dynamic nature of physiological responses to salt stress. The genetic basis of these physiological responses is predicted to be polygenic. In an effort to address this challenge, we generated temporal imaging data from 378 diverse rice genotypes across 14 d of 90 mm NaCl stress and developed a statistical model to assess the genetic architecture of dynamic salinity-induced growth responses in rice germplasm. A genomic region on chromosome 3 was strongly associated with the early growth response and was captured using visible range imaging. Fluorescence imaging identified four genomic regions linked to salinity-induced fluorescence responses. A region on chromosome 1 regulates both the fluorescence shift indicative of the longer term ionic stress and the early growth rate decline during salinity stress. We present, to our knowledge, a new approach to capture the dynamic plant responses to its environment and elucidate the genetic basis of these responses using a longitudinal genome-wide association model.
26259187	Loss of function of OsMADS3 via the insertion of a novel retrotransposon leads to recessive male sterility in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Plant Sci	Natural mutation is the source of natural variation, which is the fundamental basis for the genetic improvement of crops. During the process of developing a recombinant inbred line (RI), a spontaneous mutagenesis in RI127 led to the production of the recessive male-sterile line RI127S. Via a map-based cloning approach, the gene controlling the male sterility was identified as OsMADS3, which was previously reported to be associated with floral organ development and male sterility. Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR isolated one 1633-bp insertion in OsMADS3 in RI127S, which damaged its function due to failed transcription. The 1633-bp insertion was derived from a fragment flanked by retrotransposon genes on chromosome 5. Seven haplotypes of OsMADS3 were observed among 529 cultivars and 107 wild rice accessions, and 98% of the investigated genotypes carried the same H2 haplotype, indicating that OsMADS3 is highly conserved. RI127S has the combined genome constitution of its parents, indica rice Teqing and japonica 02428, and carries the widely compatible S5 gene donated by 02428. RI127 exhibits good performance in regard to its agronomic traits and has a wide compatibility. Therefore, RI127S would be an elite mediator for recurrent breeding in cases requiring a tedious hand-crossing-based inter-crossing phase. RI127S can be crossed not only with indica rice but also with japonica rice, thus providing breeders with flexible arrangements in recurrent breeding programs.
26096631	Genetic interactions between diverged alleles of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Heading date 3a (Hd3a)/ RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) control differential heading and contribute to regional adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	New Phytol	Initiation of flowering, also called heading, in rice (Oryza sativa) is determined by the florigens encoded by Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1). Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) regulates Hd3a and RFT1. However, different rice varieties have diverged alleles of Ehd1 and Hd3a/RFT1 and their genetic interactions remain largely unclear. Here we generated three segregating populations for different combinations of diverged Ehd1 and Hd3a/RFT1 alleles, and analyzed their genetic interactions between these alleles. We demonstrated that, in an ehd1 mutant background, Hd3a was silenced, but RFT1 was expressed (although at lower levels than in plants with a functional Ehd1) under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. We identified a nonfunctional RFT1 allele (rft1); the lines carrying homozygous ehd1 and Hd3a/rft1 failed to induce the floral transition under SD and LD conditions. Like Hd3a, RFT1 also interacted with 14-3-3 proteins, the florigen receptors, but a nonfunctional RFT1 with a crucial E105K mutation failed to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Furthermore, analyses of sequence variation and geographic distribution suggested that functional RFT1 alleles were selected during rice adaptation to high-latitude regions. Our results demonstrate the important roles of RFT1 in rice flowering and regional adaptation.
26102588	Rice stripe1-2 and stripe1-3 Mutants Encoding the Small Subunit of Ribonucleotide Reductase Are Temperature Sensitive and Are Required for Chlorophyll Biosynthesis.	2015	PLoS One	We induced mutants, stripe1-2 (st1-2) and stripe1-3 (st1-3), from rice (Oryza sativa L.) Indica 9311 using Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Both st1-2 and st1-3 mutants encoded the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase 1 (RNRS1), differed in the location of the mutated base, and displayed white-stripe from the L2 stage through maturity. The mutants were sensitive to temperature, and their chlorophyll content increased with the increase in temperature; however, they did not revert to normal green leaf phenotype under field conditions. The mutant st1-2 showed loosely arranged thylakoid lamellar structure as compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Contrastingly, st1-3 displayed normal thylakoid lamellar structure, good agronomic traits, and higher yield than st1-2 but lower yield than WT. Three-dimensional structure prediction for RNRS1 indicated that the mutation in Val-171 residue in st1-2 influenced the connection of RNRS1 to iron, causing abnormal development of chloroplasts. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels associated with chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and photosynthesis were affected in st1-2 and st1-3 at different temperatures and different developmental stages.
26083713	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	2015	Elife	Plants generally respond to herbivore attack by increasing resistance and decreasing growth. This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signaling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor activation and resistance against C. suppressalis. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signaling as the causal factor in N. lugens susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity.
26105598	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Grain length, as a critical trait for rice grain size and shape, has a great effect on grain yield and appearance quality. Although several grain size/shape genes have been cloned, the genetic interaction among these genes and the molecular mechanisms of grain size/shape architecture have not yet to be explored.

RESULTS: To investigate the genetic interaction between two major grain length loci of rice, GS3 and qGL3, we developed two near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-GS3 (GS3/qGL3) and NIL-qgl3 (gs3/qgl3), in the genetic background of 93-11 (gs3/qGL3) by conventional backcrossing and marker-assisted selection (MAS). Another NIL-GS3/qgl3 (GS3/qgl3) was developed by crossing NIL-GS3 with NIL-qgl3 and using MAS. By comparing the grain lengths of 93-11, NIL-GS3, NIL-qgl3 and NIL-GS3/qgl3, we investigated the effects of GS3, qGL3 and GS3 × qGL3 interaction on grain length based on two-way ANOVA. We found that GS3 and qGL3 had additive effects on rice grain length regulation. Comparative analysis of primary panicle transcriptomes in the four NILs revealed that the genes affected by GS3 and qGL3 partially overlapped, and both loci might be involved in brassinosteroid signaling.

CONCLUSION: Our data provide new information to better understand the rice grain length regulation mechanism and help rice breeders improve rice yield and appearance quality by molecular design breeding.
26086245	A Chromosome Segment Substitution Library of Weedy Rice for Genetic Dissection of Complex Agronomic and Domestication Traits.	2015	PLoS One	Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) are a powerful alternative for locating quantitative trait loci (QTL), analyzing gene interactions, and providing starting materials for map-based cloning projects. We report the development and characterization of a CSSL library of a U.S. weedy rice accession 'PSRR-1' with genome-wide coverage in an adapted rice cultivar 'Bengal' background. The majority of the CSSLs carried a single defined weedy rice segment with an average introgression segment of 2.8 % of the donor genome. QTL mapping results for several agronomic and domestication traits from the CSSL population were compared with those obtained from two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations involving the same weedy rice accession. There was congruence of major effect QTLs between both types of populations, but new and additional QTLs were detected in the CSSL population. Although, three major effect QTLs for plant height were detected on chromosomes 1, 4, and 8 in the CSSL population, the latter two escaped detection in both RIL populations. Since this was observed for many traits, epistasis may play a major role for the phenotypic variation observed in weedy rice. High levels of shattering and seed dormancy in weedy rice might result from an accumulation of many small effect QTLs. Several CSSLs with desirable agronomic traits (e.g. longer panicles, longer grains, and higher seed weight) identified in this study could be useful for rice breeding. Since weedy rice is a reservoir of genes for many weedy and agronomic attributes, the CSSL library will serve as a valuable resource to discover latent genetic diversity for improving crop productivity and understanding the plant domestication process through cloning and characterization of the underlying genes.
26076351	Identification of Novel SNP in Promoter Sequence of TaGW2-6A Associated with Grain Weight and Other Agronomic Traits in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2015	PLoS One	TaGW2 is an orthologue of rice gene OsGW2, which encodes E3 RING ubiquitin ligase and controls the grain size in rice. In wheat, three copies of TaGW2 have been identified and mapped on wheat homoeologous group 6 viz. TaGW2-6A, TaGW2-6B and TaGW2-6D. In the present study, using as many as 207 Indian wheat genotypes, we identified four SNPs including two novel SNPs (SNP-988 and SNP-494) in the promoter sequence of TaGW2-6A. All the four SNPs were G/A or A/G substitutions (transitions). Out of the four SNPs, SNP-494 was causal, since it was found associated with grain weight. The mean TGW (41.1 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_A was significantly higher than mean TGW (38.6 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_G. SNP-494 also regulates the expression of TaGW2-6A so that the wheat genotypes with SNP-494_G have higher expression and lower TGW and the genotypes with SNP-494_A have lower expression but higher TGW. Besides, SNP-494 was also found associated with grain length-width ratio, awn length, spike length, grain protein content, peduncle length and plant height. This suggested that gene TaGW2-6A not only controls grain size, but also controls other agronomic traits. In the promoter region, SNP-494 was present in 'CGCG' motif that plays an important role in Ca2+/calmodulin mediated regulation of genes. A user-friendly CAPS marker was also developed to identify the desirable allele of causal SNP (SNP-494) for use in marker-assisted selection for improvement of grain weight in wheat. Using four SNPs, five haplotypes were identified; of these, Hap_5 (G_A_G_A) was found to be a desirable haplotype having significantly higher grain weight (41.13g) relative to other four haplotypes (36.33-39.16 g).
26081948	Identification and fine-mapping of a new resistance gene, Xa40, conferring resistance to bacterial blight races in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A new bacterial blight resistance gene has been identified through fine-mapping, which confers high levels of resistance to all Korean Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) races, including the new Xoo race K3a. Rice bacterial leaf blight (BB) disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a serious constraint to rice production in Asia and Africa. The japonica advanced backcross breeding lines derived from the indica line IR65482-7-216-1-2 in the background of cultivar Junam are resistant to all Korean BB races, including K3a. To identify the gene(s) involved in resistance to Korean Xoo races, the association of genotypic and phenotypic variations was examined in two F2 populations derived from the crosses between 11325 (IR83261-3-7-23-6-2-1-1-2-1-2)/Anmi and 11325/Ilpum. The segregation ratios of F2 individuals from the crosses of 11325/Anmi and 11325/Ilpum were 578 resistant:209 susceptible and 555 resistant:241 susceptible, respectively, which is consistent with the expected allelic frequency of a 3:1 ratio. Genetic analysis using graphical mapping indicated that resistance (R) was controlled by a new resistance gene linked with the flanking markers RM27320 and ID55.WA18-5 within an approximately 80-kb region between 28.14 and 28.22 Mbp on chromosome 11. The eight candidate genes functionally predicted were included in the target region. Examination of the candidate genes by RT-PCR analysis only corroborated with the significant difference in transcript levels of the WAK3 gene in the presence or absence of pathogen infection. Allelism tests performed with other known BB R-genes revealed that the allele was distinct from others having a similar chromosomal location.
26125886	QTLs for rice flag leaf traits in doubled haploid populations in different environments.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Two rice doubled haploid (DH) populations derived from the crosses of ZYQ8/JX17 and CJ06/TN1 were used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for flag leaf length (FLL), width (FLW), and angle (FLA) under long-day conditions in Hangzhou (subtropical zone) and short-day conditions in Hainan (tropical zone), China. The four parents differed significantly in all 3 traits. FLL was found to be positively correlated with FLW in the 2 populations. A total of 30 QTLs were identified for flag leaf traits, with a contribution to the phenotypic variation of each QTL from 4.49 to 26.30%. Among these, qFLL-4b, qFLW-12, and qFLA-2a showed larger additive effects on the phenotype and explained more variations compared to the other QTLs. qFLL-1a and qFLL-8 were detected in both environments, while qFLL-2, qFLL-3, qFLL-10, qFLL-12, qFLW11, qFLW2, and qFLA8 were novel QTLs, which may be beneficial to rice ideal-type breeding.
26071212	Molecular and functional characterization of the durum wheat TdRL1, a member of the conserved Poaceae RSS1-like family that exhibits features of intrinsically disordered proteins and confers stress tolerance in yeast.	2015	Funct Integr Genomics	Because of their fixed lifestyle, plants must acclimate to environmental changes by orchestrating several responses ranging from protective measures to growth control. Growth arrest is observed upon abiotic stress and can cause penalties to plant production. But, the molecular interface between stress perception and cell cycle control is poorly understood. The rice protein RSS1 is required at G1/S transition ensuring normal dividing activity of proliferative cells during salt stress. The role of RSS1 in meristem maintenance together with its flexible protein structure implies its key function as molecular integrator of stress signaling for cell cycle control. To study further the relevance of RSS1 and its related proteins in cereals, we isolated the durum wheat homolog, TdRL1, from Tunisian durum wheat varieties and extended our analyses to RSS1-like proteins from Poaceae. Our results show that the primary sequences of TdRL1 and the Graminae RSS1-like family members are highly conserved. In silico analyses predict that TdRL1 and other RSS1-like proteins share flexible 3-D structures and have features of intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins (IDP). The disordered structure of TdRL1 is well illustrated by an electrophoretical mobility shift of the purified protein. Moreover, heterologous expression of TdRL1 in yeast improves its tolerance to salt and heat stresses strongly suggesting its involvement in abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms. Such finding adds new knowledge to our understanding of how IDPs may contribute as central molecular integrators of stress signaling into improving plant tolerance to abiotic stresses.
26174670	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	2015	J Genet	Low temperature stress is one of the major limiting factors affecting rice productivity in higher altitudes. DREB1A and DREB1B, are two transcription factors that have been reported to play key regulatory role in low temperature tolerance. In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature. Expression data suggests induction of gene expression in shoots in response to low temperature in both tolerant and susceptible genotypes. Upon sequence analysis of 20 rice genotypes, eight nucleotide changes were identified including two in the coding region and six in the 5'UTR. None of the discovered novel variations lie in the conserved region of the genes under study, thereby causing little or no changes in putative function of the corresponding proteins. In silico analysis using a diverse set of 400 O. sativa revealed much lower nucleotide diversity estimates across two DREB loci and one other gene (MYB2) involved in DREB pathway than those observed for other rice genes. None of the changes showed association with seedling stage cold tolerance, suggesting that nucleotide changes in DREB loci are unlikely to contribute to low temperature tolerance. So far, data concerning the physiological role and regulation of DREB1 in different genetic background are very limited; it is to be expected that they will be studied extensively in the near future.
26035591	Overexpression of an AP2/ERF Type Transcription Factor OsEREBP1 Confers Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	AP2/ERF-type transcription factors regulate important functions of plant growth and development as well as responses to environmental stimuli. A rice AP2/ERF transcription factor, OsEREBP1 is a downstream component of a signal transduction pathway in a specific interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and its bacterial pathogen, Xoo (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). Constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 in rice driven by maize ubiquitin promoter did not affect normal plant growth. Microarray analysis revealed that over expression of OsEREBP1 caused increased expression of lipid metabolism related genes such as lipase and chloroplastic lipoxygenase as well as several genes related to jasmonate and abscisic acid biosynthesis. PR genes, transcription regulators and Aldhs (alcohol dehydrogenases) implicated in abiotic stress and submergence tolerance were also upregulated in transgenic plants. Transgenic plants showed increase in endogenous levels of α-linolenate, several jasmonate derivatives and abscisic acid but not salicylic acid. Soluble modified GFP (SmGFP)-tagged OsEREBP1 was localized to plastid nucleoids. Comparative analysis of non-transgenic and OsEREBP1 overexpressing genotypes revealed that OsEREBP1 attenuates disease caused by Xoo and confers drought and submergence tolerance in transgenic rice. Our results suggest that constitutive expression of OsEREBP1 activates the jasmonate and abscisic acid signalling pathways thereby priming the rice plants for enhanced survival under abiotic or biotic stress conditions. OsEREBP1 is thus, a good candidate gene for engineering plants for multiple stress tolerance.
26112675	A comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of rice in response to bacterial blight.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice is a major crop worldwide. Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) has become one of the most devastating diseases for rice. It has been clear that phosphorylation plays essential roles in plant disease resistance. However, the role of phosphorylation is poorly understood in rice-Xoo system. Here, we report the first study on large scale enrichment of phosphopeptides and identification of phosphosites in rice before and 24 h after Xoo infection.

RESULTS: We have successfully identified 2367 and 2223 phosphosites on 1334 and 1297 representative proteins in 0 h and 24 h after Xoo infection, respectively. A total of 762 differentially phosphorylated proteins, including transcription factors, kinases, epi-genetic controlling factors and many well-known disease resistant proteins, are identified after Xoo infection suggesting that they may be functionally relevant to Xoo resistance. In particular, we found that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation might be a key switch turning on/off many epi-genetic controlling factors, including HDT701, in response to Xoo infection, suggesting that phosphorylation switch overriding the epi-genetic regulation may be a very universal model in the plant disease resistance pathway.

CONCLUSIONS: The phosphosites identified in this study would be a big complementation to our current knowledge in the phosphorylation status and sites of rice proteins. This research represents a substantial advance in understanding the rice phosphoproteome as well as the mechanism of rice bacterial blight resistance.

26033328	Production of oleanane-type sapogenin in transgenic rice via expression of β-amyrin synthase gene from Panax japonicus C. A. Mey.	2015	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Panax japonicus C. A. Mey. is a rare traditional Chinese herbal medicine that uses ginsenosides as its main active ingredient. Rice does not produce ginsenosides because it lacks a key rate-limiting enzyme (β-amyrin synthase, βAS); however, it produces a secondary metabolite, 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is a precursor for ginsenoside biosynthesis.

RESULTS: In the present study, the P. japonicus βAS gene was transformed into the rice cultivar 'Taijing 9' using an Agrobacterium-mediated approach, resulting in 68 rice transgenic plants of the T0 generation. Transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertion sites in homozygous lines of the T2 generation were determined by using high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (hiTAIL-PCR) and were found to vary among the tested lines. Approximately 1-2 copies of the βAS gene were detected in transgenic rice plants. Real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses showed that the transformed βAS gene could be overexpressed and β-amyrin synthase could be expressed in rice. HPLC analysis showed that the concentration of oleanane-type sapogenin oleanolic acid in transgenic rice was 8.3-11.5 mg/100 g dw.

CONCLUSIONS: The current study is the first report on the transformation of P. japonicus βAS gene into rice. We have successfully produced a new rice germplasm, "ginseng rice", which produces oleanane-type sapogenin.
26071275	Fine mapping of qGW1, a major QTL for grain weight in sorghum.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	We detected seven QTLs for 100-grain weight in sorghum using an F 2 population, and delimited qGW1 to a 101-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 1, which contained 13 putative genes. Sorghum is one of the most important cereal crops. Breeding high-yielding sorghum varieties will have a profound impact on global food security. Grain weight is an important component of grain yield. It is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs); however, the genetic basis of grain weight in sorghum is not well understood. In the present study, using an F2 population derived from a cross between the grain sorghum variety SA2313 (Sorghum bicolor) and the Sudan-grass variety Hiro-1 (S. bicolor), we detected seven QTLs for 100-grain weight. One of them, qGW1, was detected consistently over 2 years and contributed between 20 and 40 % of the phenotypic variation across multiple genetic backgrounds. Using extreme recombinants from a fine-mapping F3 population, we delimited qGW1 to a 101-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 1, containing 13 predicted gene models, one of which was found to be under purifying selection during domestication. However, none of the grain size candidate genes shared sequence similarity with previously cloned grain weight-related genes from rice. This study will facilitate isolation of the gene underlying qGW1 and advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of grain weight. SSR markers linked to the qGW1 locus can be used for improving sorghum grain yield through marker-assisted selection.
26082787	Expression of wild-type PtrIAA14.1, a poplar Aux/IAA gene causes morphological changes in Arabidopsis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Aux/IAA proteins are transcriptional repressors that control auxin signaling by interacting with auxin response factors (ARFs). So far all of the identified Aux/IAA mutants with auxin-related phenotypes in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) are dominant gain-of-function mutants, with mutations in Domain II that affected stability of the corresponding Aux/IAA proteins. On the other hand, morphological changes were observed in knock-down mutants of Aux/IAA genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), suggesting that functions of Aux/IAA proteins may be specific for certain plant species. We report here the characterization of PtrIAA14.1, a poplar (Populus trichocarpa) homolog of IAA7. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PtrIAA14.1 is a classic Aux/IAA protein. It contains four conserved domains with the repressor motif in Domain I, the degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV. Protoplast transfection assays showed that PtrIAA14.1 is localized in nucleus. It is unable in the presence of auxin, and it represses auxin response reporter gene expression. Expression of wild-type PtrIAA14.1 in Arabidopsis resulted in auxin-related phenotypes including down-curling leaves, semi-draft with increased number of branches, and greatly reduced fertility, but expression of the Arabidopsis Aux/IAA genes tested remain largely unchanged in the transgenic plants. Protein-protein interaction assays in yeast and protoplasts showed that PtrIAA14.1 interacted with ARF5, but not other ARFs. Consistent with this observation, vascular patterning was altered in the transgenic plants, and the expression of AtHB8 (Arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene 8) was reduced in transgenic plants.
26045464	Cross-Species Network Analysis Uncovers Conserved Nitrogen-Regulated Network Modules in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	In this study, we used a cross-species network approach to uncover nitrogen (N)-regulated network modules conserved across a model and a crop species. By translating gene network knowledge from the data-rich model Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to a crop, rice (Oryza sativa), we identified evolutionarily conserved N-regulatory modules as targets for translational studies to improve N use efficiency in transgenic plants. To uncover such conserved N-regulatory network modules, we first generated an N-regulatory network based solely on rice transcriptome and gene interaction data. Next, we enhanced the network knowledge in the rice N-regulatory network using transcriptome and gene interaction data from Arabidopsis and new data from Arabidopsis and rice plants exposed to the same N treatment conditions. This cross-species network analysis uncovered a set of N-regulated transcription factors (TFs) predicted to target the same genes and network modules in both species. Supernode analysis of the TFs and their targets in these conserved network modules uncovered genes directly related to N use (e.g. N assimilation) and to other shared biological processes indirectly related to N. This cross-species network approach was validated with members of two TF families in the supernode network, BASIC-LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1-TGA and HYPERSENSITIVITY TO LOW PI-ELICITED PRIMARY ROOT SHORTENING1 (HRS1)/HRS1 Homolog family, which have recently been experimentally validated to mediate the N response in Arabidopsis.
26082998	Succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II) is a source of reactive oxygen species in plants and regulates development and stress responses.	2015	New Phytol	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules that regulate plant development and responses to stresses. Mitochondria are the source of most ROS in heterotrophic cells, and mitochondrial complex I and complex III are regarded as the main sites of ROS production in plant mitochondria. Recent studies have demonstrated that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) also contributes to mitochondrial ROS production. However, the ability of SDH to generate ROS in plants is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SDH in mitochondrial ROS production. Our results demonstrated that SDH is a direct source of ROS in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, and the induction of ROS production by specific SDH inhibitors impaired plant growth. In addition, this effect was accompanied by the down-regulation of cell cycle genes and the up-regulation of stress-related genes. However, the partial inhibition of SDH by a competitive inhibitor decreased ROS production, which was associated with increased shoot and root growth, and prevented the down-regulation of cell cycle genes and the induction of stress-related genes by noncompetitive inhibitors. In conclusion, SDH plays an important role in ROS production, being a direct source of ROS in plant mitochondria and regulating plant development and stress responses.
26084707	Functional marker development of miR1511-InDel and allelic diversity within the genus Glycine.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Single-stranded non-protein coding small RNAs, 18-25 nucleotides in length, are ubiquitous throughout plants genomes and are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Several types of DNA markers have been reported for the detection of genetic diversity or sequence variation in soybean, one of the most important legume crops in worldwide for seed protein and oil content. Recently, with the available of public genomic databases, there has been a shift from the labor-intensive development of PCR-based markers to sequence-based genotyping and the development of functional markers within genes, often coupled with the use of RNA information. But thus far miRNA-based markers have been only developed in rice and tobacco. Here we report the first functional molecular miRNA marker, miR1511-InDel, in soybean for a specific single copy locus used to assess genetic variation in domesticated soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr) and its wild progenitor (Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.).

RESULTS: We genotyped a total of 1,669 accessions of domesticated soybean (G. max) and its wild progenitor G. soja which are native throughout the China and parts of Korea, Japan and Russia. The results indicate that the miR1511 locus is distributed in cultivated soybean and has three alleles in annual wild soybean. Based on this result, we proposed that miR-InDel marker technology can be used to assess genetic variation. The inclusion of geo-reference data with miR1511-InDel marker data corroborated that accessions from the Yellow River basin (Huanghuai) exhibited high genetic diversity which provides more molecular evidence for gene diversity in annual wild soybean and domestication of soybean.

CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the use of RNA marker, miRNA1511-InDel, as a soybean-specific functional maker for the study of genetic diversity, genotyping of germplasm and evolution studies. This is also the first report of functional marker developed from soybean miRNA located within the functional region of pre-miRNA1511.
26054324	Genome-wide survey and expression analysis of the PUB family in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinesis).	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	U-box proteins are widely distributed among eukaryotic organisms and show a higher prevalence in plants than in other organisms. Plant U-box (PUB) proteins play crucial regulatory roles in various developmental and physiological processes. Previously, 64 and 77 PUB genes have been identified in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. In this study, 101 putative PUB genes were identified in the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42) genome and compared with other 15 representative plants. By specific protein domains and a phylogenetic analysis, the B. rapa PUB (BrPUB) gene family was subdivided into 10 groups. Localization of BrPUB genes showed an uneven distribution on the ten chromosomes of B. rapa. The orthologous and co-orthologous PUB gene pairs were identified between B. rapa and A. thaliana. RNA-seq transcriptome data of different tissues revealed tissue-specific and differential expression profiles of the BrPUBs, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed inverse gene expression patterns of the BrPUB-ARMs in response to cold and heat stresses. Altogether, the identification, classification, phylogenetic analysis, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs, and expression patterns of BrPUBs were predicted and analysed. Importantly, this study of BrPUBs provides a rich resource that will aid in the determination of PUB functions in plant development.
26089199	Generation of inheritable and "transgene clean" targeted genome-modified rice in later generations using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	2015	Sci Rep	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is becoming an important genome editing tool for crop breeding. Although it has been demonstrated that target mutations can be transmitted to the next generation, their inheritance pattern has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we describe the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of four different rice genes with the help of online target-design tools. High-frequency mutagenesis and a large percentage of putative biallelic mutations were observed in T0 generations. Nonetheless, our results also indicate that the progeny genotypes of biallelic T0 lines are frequently difficult to predict and that the transmission of mutations largely does not conform to classical genetic laws, which suggests that the mutations in T0 transgenic rice are mainly somatic mutations. Next, we followed the inheritance pattern of T1 plants. Regardless of the presence of the CRISPR/Cas9 transgene, the mutations in T1 lines were stably transmitted to later generations, indicating a standard germline transmission pattern. Off-target effects were also evaluated, and our results indicate that with careful target selection, off-target mutations are rare in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated rice gene editing. Taken together, our results indicate the promising production of inheritable and "transgene clean" targeted genome-modified rice in the T1 generation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.
26089830	The knottin-like Blufensin family regulates genes involved in nuclear import and the secretory pathway in barley-powdery mildew interactions.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Plants have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms to control a multi-layered defense response to microbial attack. Both temporal and spatial gene expression are tightly regulated in response to pathogen ingress, modulating both positive and negative control of defense. BLUFENSINs, small knottin-like peptides in barley, wheat, and rice, are highly induced by attack from fungal pathogens, in particular, the obligate biotrophic fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), causal agent of barley powdery mildew. Previous research indicated that Blufensin1 (Bln1) functions as a negative regulator of basal defense mechanisms. In the current report, we show that BLN1 and BLN2 can both be secreted to the apoplast and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated overexpression of Bln2 increases susceptibility of barley to Bgh. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays signify that BLN1 and BLN2 can interact with each other, and with calmodulin. We then used BSMV-induced gene silencing to knock down Bln1, followed by Barley1 GeneChip transcriptome analysis, to identify additional host genes influenced by Bln1. Analysis of differential expression revealed a gene set enriched for those encoding proteins annotated to nuclear import and the secretory pathway, particularly Importin α1-b and Sec61 γ subunits. Further functional analysis of these two affected genes showed that when silenced, they also reduced susceptibility to Bgh. Taken together, we postulate that Bln1 is co-opted by Bgh to facilitate transport of disease-related host proteins or effectors, influencing the establishment of Bgh compatibility on its barley host.
26073760	Physiological and biochemical mechanisms associated with trehalose-induced copper-stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	In this study, we examined the possible mechanisms of trehalose (Tre) in improving copper-stress (Cu-stress) tolerance in rice seedlings. Our findings indicated that pretreatment of rice seedlings with Tre enhanced the endogenous Tre level and significantly mitigated the toxic effects of excessive Cu on photosynthesis- and plant growth-related parameters. The improved tolerance induced by Tre could be attributed to its ability to reduce Cu uptake and decrease Cu-induced oxidative damage by lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde in Cu-stressed plants. Tre counteracted the Cu-induced increase in proline and glutathione content, but significantly improved ascorbic acid content and redox status. The activities of major antioxidant enzymes were largely stimulated by Tre pretreatment in rice plants exposed to excessive Cu. Additionally, increased activities of glyoxalases I and II correlated with reduced levels of methylglyoxal in Tre-pretreated Cu-stressed rice plants. These results indicate that modifying the endogenous Tre content by Tre pretreatment improved Cu tolerance in rice plants by inhibiting Cu uptake and regulating the antioxidant and glyoxalase systems, and thereby demonstrated the important role of Tre in mitigating heavy metal toxicity. Our findings provide a solid foundation for developing metal toxicity-tolerant crops by genetic engineering of Tre biosynthesis.
26063739	Determinants of nucleosome positioning and their influence on plant gene expression.	2015	Genome Res	Nucleosome positioning influences the access of transcription factors (TFs) to their binding sites and gene expression. Studies in plant, animal, and fungal models demonstrate similar nucleosome positioning patterns along genes and correlations between occupancy and expression. However, the relationships among nucleosome positioning, cis-regulatory element accessibility, and gene expression in plants remain undefined. Here we showed that plant nucleosome depletion occurs on specific 6-mer motifs and this sequence-specific nucleosome depletion is predictive of expression levels. Nucleosome-depleted regions in Arabidopsis thaliana tend to have higher G/C content, unlike yeast, and are centered on specific G/C-rich 6-mers, suggesting that intrinsic sequence properties, such as G/C content, cannot fully explain plant nucleosome positioning. These 6-mer motif sites showed higher DNase I hypersensitivity and are flanked by strongly phased nucleosomes, consistent with known TF binding sites. Intriguingly, this 6-mer-specific nucleosome depletion pattern occurs not only in promoter but also in genic regions and is significantly correlated with higher gene expression level, a phenomenon also found in rice but not in yeast. Among the 6-mer motifs enriched in genes responsive to treatment with the defense hormone jasmonate, there are no significant changes in nucleosome occupancy, suggesting that these sites are potentially preconditioned to enable rapid response without changing chromatin state significantly. Our study provides a global assessment of the joint contribution of nucleosome occupancy and motif sequences that are likely cis-elements to the control of gene expression in plants. Our findings pave the way for further understanding the impact of chromatin state on plant transcriptional regulatory circuits.
26069451	Variation in primary metabolites in parental and near-isogenic lines of the QTL <i>qDTY</i><sub><i>12.1</i></sub> : altered roots and flag leaves but similar spikelets of rice under drought.	None	Mol Breed	There is a widespread consensus that drought will mostly affect present and future agriculture negatively. Generating drought-tolerant crops is thus a high priority. However complicated the underlying genetic and regulatory networks for differences in plant performance under stress are, they would be reflected in straightforward differences in primary metabolites. This is because primary metabolites such as amino acids and sugars form the building blocks of all pathways and processes for growth, development, reproduction, and environmental responses. Comparison of such differences was undertaken between the parental line and a near-isogenic line of qDTY12.1 , a QTL for rice yield under drought. The comparison was informative regarding the effect of the QTL in three genetic backgrounds: donor, recipient, and improved recipient, thus illustrating the gene × gene (G × G) interactions. Such a comparison when extended to well-watered and drought conditions illustrated the gene × environment (G × E) interactions. Assessment of such G × G and G × E responses in roots, flag leaves, and spikelets added a yet more informative dimension of tissue-specific responses to drought, mediated by qDTY12.1 . Data on variation in primary metabolites subjected to ANOVA, Tukey's test, Welch's t test, and PCA underscored the importance of the roots and demonstrated concordance between variation in metabolites and morpho-physiological responses to drought. Results suggested that for gainful insights into rice yield under drought, rather than vegetative stage drought tolerance, multiple tissues and genotypes must be assessed at the reproductive stage to avoid misleading conclusions about using particular metabolites or related genes and proteins as candidates or markers for drought tolerance.
26175616	Quantitative trait loci for whiteness of cooked rice detected in improved rice cultivars in Hokkaido.	2015	Breed Sci	Improving the eating quality of cooked rice has been one of the most important objectives in rice breeding programs. Eating quality of cooked rice is a complex trait including several components, such as external appearance, taste, aroma, and texture. Therefore, dissection of these components followed by marker-assisted selection of detected QTL(s) may be a useful approach for achieving desirable eating quality in rice breeding. Whiteness of cooked rice (WCR) is an important factor related to the external appearance of cooked rice. WCR is known to be associated with the amylose and protein contents of the endosperm. However, the genetic basis of WCR remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated phenotypic variation in WCR among recently developed rice cultivars from Hokkaido, Japan. Then, we developed doubled haploid lines (DHLs) derived from a cross between two cultivars from Hokkaido, Joiku No. 462 (high WCR) and Jokei06214 (low WCR). Using the DHLs, we detected two QTLs for WCR, qWCR3 and qWCR11, on chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. We also examined the dosage effect of the two QTLs based on both the categorized segregants in the DHLs and the relationship between the WCR phenotype and inheritance around the QTL regions in cultivars from Hokkaido.
26259185	A decrease in phytic acid content substantially affects the distribution of mineral elements within rice seeds.	2015	Plant Sci	Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate; InsP6) is the storage compound of phosphorus and many mineral elements in seeds. To determine the role of InsP6 in the accumulation and distribution of mineral elements in seeds, we performed fine mappings of mineral elements through synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence analysis using developing seeds from two independent low phytic acid (lpa) mutants of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The reduced InsP6 in lpa seeds did not affect the translocation of mineral elements from vegetative organs into seeds, because the total amounts of phosphorus and the other mineral elements in lpa seeds were identical to those in the wild type (WT). However, the reduced InsP6 caused large changes in mineral localization within lpa seeds. Phosphorus and potassium in the aleurone layer of lpa greatly decreased and diffused into the endosperm. Zinc and copper, which were broadly distributed from the aleurone layer to the inner endosperm in the WT, were localized in the narrower space around the aleurone layer in lpa mutants. We also confirmed that similar distribution changes occurred in transgenic rice with the lpa phenotype. Using these results, we discussed the role of InsP6 in the dynamic accumulation and distribution patterns of mineral elements during seed development.
26136752	Integration of the proteome and transcriptome reveals multiple levels of gene regulation in the rice dl2 mutant.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Leaf vascular system differentiation and venation patterns play a key role in transporting nutrients and maintaining the plant shape, which is an important agronomic trait for improving photosynthetic efficiency. However, there is little knowledge about the regulation of leaf vascular specification and development. Here we utilized the rice midribless mutant (dl2) to investigate the molecular changes in transcriptome and proteome profiles during leaf vascular specification and differentiation. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with digital gene expression (DGE) techniques, a nearly complete catalog of expressed protein and mRNA was acquired. From the catalog, we reliably identified 3172 proteins and 9,865,230 tags mapped to genes, and subsets of 141 proteins and 98 mRNAs, which were differentially expressed between the dl2 mutant and wild type. The correlation analysis between the abundance of differentially expressed mRNA and DEPs (differentially expressed proteins) revealed numerous discordant changes in mRNA/protein pairs and only a modest correlation was observed, indicative of divergent regulation of transcription and translational processes. The DEPs were analyzed for their involvement in biological processes and metabolic pathways. Up- or down- regulation of some key proteins confirmed that the physiological process of vascular differentiation is an active process. These key proteins included those not previously reported to be associated with vascular differentiation processes, and included proteins that are involved in the spliceosome pathway. Together, our results show that the developmental and physiological process of the leaf vascular system is a thoroughly regulated and complicated process and this work has identified potential targets for genetic modification that could be used to regulate the development of the leaf vasculature.
26092704	Comparative analysis of plant lycopene cyclases.	2015	Comput Biol Chem	Carotenoids are essential isoprenoid pigments produced by plants, algae, fungi and bacteria. Lycopene cyclase (LYC) commonly cyclize carotenoids, which is an important branching step in the carotenogenesis, at one or both end of the backbone. Plants have two types of LYC (β-LCY and ϵ-LCY). In this study, plant LYCs were analyzed. Based on domain analysis, all LYCs accommodate lycopene cyclase domain (Pf05834). Furthermore, motif analysis indicated that motifs were conserved among the plants. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs were classified in β and ϵ groups. Monocot and dicot plants separated from each other in the phylogenetic tree. Subsequently, Oryza sativa Japonica Group and Zea mays of LYCs as monocot plants and Vitis vinifera and Solanum lycopersicum of LYCs as dicot plants were analyzed. According to nucleotide diversity analysis of β-LCY and ϵ-LCY genes, nucleotide diversities were found to be π: 0.30 and π: 0.25, respectively. The result highlighted β-LCY genes showed higher nucleotide diversity than ϵ-LCY genes. LYCs interacting genes and their co-expression partners were also predicted using String server. The obtained data suggested the importance of LYCs in carotenoid metabolism. 3D modeling revealed that depicted structures were similar in O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs. Likewise, the predicted binding sites were highly similar between O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera LCYs. Most importantly, analysis elucidated the V/IXGXGXXGXXXA motif for both type of LYC (β-LCY and ϵ-LCY). This motif related to Rossmann fold domain and probably provides a flat platform for binding of FAD in O. sativa, Z mays, S. lycopersicum, and V. vinifera β-LCYs and ϵ-LCYs with conserved structure. In addition to lycopene cyclase domain, the V/IXGXGXXGXXXA motif can be used for exploring LYCs proteins and to annotate the function of unknown proteins containing lycopene cyclase domain. Overall results indicated that a high degree of conserved signature were observed in plant LYCs.
26098557	Targeting Hormone-Related Pathways to Improve Grain Yield in Rice: A Chemical Approach.	2015	PLoS One	Sink/source relationships, regulating the mobilization of stored carbohydrates from the vegetative tissues to the grains, are of key importance for grain filling and grain yield. We used different inhibitors of plant hormone action to assess their effects on grain yield and on the expression of hormone-associated genes. Among the tested chemicals, 2-indol-3-yl-4-oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (PEO-IAA; antagonist of auxin receptor), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA; abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis inhibitor), and 2-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB; ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor) improved grain yield in a concentration dependent manner. These effects were also dependent on the plant developmental stage. NDGA and AIB treatments induced an increase in photosynthesis in flag leaves concomitant to the increments of starch content in flag leaves and grains. NDGA inhibited the expression of ABA-responsive gene, but did not significantly decrease ABA content. Instead, NDGA significantly decreased jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid-isoleucine. Our results support the notion that the specific inhibition of jasmonic acid and ethylene biosynthesis resulted in grain yield increase in rice.
26035336	Proteomic Analysis of Phosphoproteins in the Rice Nucleus During the Early Stage of Seed Germination.	2015	J Proteome Res	The early stage of seed germination is the first step in the plant life cycle without visible morphological change. To investigate the mechanism controlling the early stage of rice seed germination, we performed gel-and label-free nuclear phosphoproteomics. A total of 3467 phosphopeptides belonging to 102 nuclear phosphoproteins from rice embryos were identified. Protein-synthesis-related proteins were mainly phosphorylated. During the first 24 h following imbibition, 115 nuclear phosphoproteins were identified, and significant changes in the phosphorylation level over time were observed in 29 phosphoproteins. Cluster analysis indicated that nucleotide-binding proteins and zinc finger CCCH- and BED-type proteins increased in abundance during the first 12 h of imbibition and then decreased. The in silico protein-protein interactions for 29 nuclear phosphoproteins indicated that the Sas10/Utp3 protein, which functions in snoRNA binding and gene silencing, was the center of the phosphoprotein network in nuclei. The germination rate of seeds was significantly slowed with phosphatase inhibitor treatment. The mRNA expression of the zinc finger CCCH-type protein did not change, and the zinc finger BED-type protein was upregulated in rice embryos during the early stage of germination with phosphatase inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of nuclear proteins are involved in rice seed germination. Furthermore, transcription factors such as zinc finger CCCH- and BED-type proteins might play a key role through nuclear phosphoproteins, and Sas10/Utp3 protein might interact with nuclear phosphoproteins in rice embryos to mediate the early stage of seed germination.
26174673	Genomewide mapping reveals a combination of different genetic effects causing the genetic basis of heterosis in two elite rice hybrids.	2015	J Genet	North Carolina design III (NCIII) is one of the most powerful and widely used mating designs for understanding the genetic basis of heterosis. However, the quantitative trait mapping (QTL) conducted in previous studies with this design was mainly based on analysis of variance (ANOVA), composite interval or multiple interval mapping methods. These methodologies could not investigate all kinds of genetic effects, especially epistatic effects, simultaneously on the whole genome. In this study, with a statistical method for mapping epistatic QTL associated with heterosis using the recombinant inbred line (RIL)-based NCIII design, we conducted QTL mapping for nine agronomic traits of two elite hybrids to characterize the mode of gene action contributing to heterosis on a whole genomewide scale. In total, 23 main-effect QTL (M-QTL) and 23 digenic interactions in IJ (indica x japonica) hybrids, 11 M-QTL and 82 digenic interactions in II (indica x indica) hybrid QTLs were identified in the present study. The variation explained by individual M-QTL or interactions ranged from 2.3 to 11.0%. The number of digenic interactions and the total variation explained by interactions of each trait were larger than those of M-QTL. The augmented genetic effect ratio of most M-QTL and digenic interactions in (L1 - L2) data of two backcross populations (L1 and L2) showed complete dominance or overdominance, and in (L1 + L2) data showed an additive effect. Our results indicated that the dominance, overdominance and epistatic effect were important in conditioning the genetic basis of heterosis of the two elite hybrids. The relative contributions of the genetic components varied with traits and the genetic basis of the two hybrids was different.
26133242	Lack of Globulin Synthesis during Seed Development Alters Accumulation of Seed Storage Proteins in Rice.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	The major seed storage proteins (SSPs) in rice seeds have been classified into three types, glutelins, prolamins, and globulin, and the proportion of each SSP varies. It has been shown in rice mutants that when either glutelins or prolamins are defective, the expression of another type of SSP is promoted to counterbalance the deficit. However, we observed reduced abundances of glutelins and prolamins in dry seeds of a globulin-deficient rice mutant (Glb-RNAi), which was generated with RNA interference (RNAi)-induced suppression of globulin expression. The expression of the prolamin and glutelin subfamily genes was reduced in the immature seeds of Glb-RNAi lines compared with those in wild type. A proteomic analysis of Glb-RNAi seeds showed that the reductions in glutelin and prolamin were conserved at the protein level. The decreased pattern in glutelin was also significant in the presence of a reductant, suggesting that the polymerization of the glutelin proteins via intramolecular disulfide bonds could be interrupted in Glb-RNAi seeds. We also observed aberrant and loosely packed structures in the storage organelles of Glb-RNAi seeds, which may be attributable to the reductions in SSPs. In this study, we evaluated the role of rice globulin in seed development, showing that a deficiency in globulin could comprehensively reduce the expression of other SSPs.
26095454	The durably resistant rice cultivar Digu activates defence gene expression before the full maturation of Magnaporthe oryzae appressorium.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Rice blast caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases worldwide. Although the rice-M. oryzae interaction has been studied extensively, the early molecular events that occur in rice before full maturation of the appressorium during M. oryzae invasion are unknown. Here, we report a comparative transcriptomics analysis of the durably resistant rice variety Digu and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to infection by M. oryzae (5, 10 and 20 h post-inoculation, prior to full development of the appressorium). We found that the transcriptional responses differed significantly between these two rice varieties. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that many biological processes, including extracellular recognition and biosynthesis of antioxidants, terpenes and hormones, were specifically activated in Digu shortly after infection. Forty-eight genes encoding receptor kinases (RKs) were significantly differentially regulated by M. oryzae infection in Digu. One of these genes, LOC_Os08g10300, encoding a leucine-rich repeat RK from the LRR VIII-2 subfamily, conferred enhanced resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in rice. Our study reveals that a multitude of molecular events occur in the durably resistant rice Digu before the full maturation of the appressorium after M. oryzae infection and that membrane-associated RKs play important roles in the early response.
26082402	Completion of Tricin Biosynthesis Pathway in Rice: Cytochrome P450 75B4 Is a Unique Chrysoeriol 5'-Hydroxylase.	2015	Plant Physiol	Flavones are ubiquitously accumulated in land plants, but their biosynthesis in monocots remained largely elusive until recent years. Recently, we demonstrated that the rice (Oryza sativa) cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP93G1 and CYP93G2 channel flavanones en route to flavone O-linked conjugates and C-glycosides, respectively. In tricin, the 3',5'-dimethoxyflavone nucleus is formed before O-linked conjugations. Previously, flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases belonging to the CYP75A subfamily were believed to generate tricetin from apigenin for 3',5'-O-methylation to form tricin. However, we report here that CYP75B4 a unique flavonoid B-ring hydroxylase indispensable for tricin formation in rice. A CYP75B4 knockout mutant is tricin deficient, with unusual accumulation of chrysoeriol (a 3'-methoxylated flavone). CYP75B4 functions as a bona fide flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase by restoring the accumulation of 3'-hydroxylated flavonoids in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transparent testa7 mutants and catalyzing in vitro 3'-hydroxylation of different flavonoids. In addition, overexpression of both CYP75B4 and CYP93G1 (a flavone synthase II) in Arabidopsis resulted in tricin accumulation. Specific 5'-hydroxylation of chrysoeriol to selgin by CYP75B4 was further demonstrated in vitro. The reaction steps leading to tricin biosynthesis are then reconstructed as naringenin → apigenin → luteolin → chrysoeriol → selgin → tricin. Hence, chrysoeriol, instead of tricetin, is an intermediate in tricin biosynthesis. CYP75B4 homologous sequences are highly conserved in Poaceae, and they are phylogenetically distinct from the canonical CYP75B flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase sequences. Recruitment of chrysoeriol-specific 5'-hydroxylase activity by an ancestral CYP75B sequence may represent a key event leading to the prevalence of tricin-derived metabolites in grasses and other monocots today.
26058362	Comprehensive phenotypic analysis and quantitative trait locus identification for grain mineral concentration, content, and yield in maize (Zea mays L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Understanding the correlations of seven minerals for concentration, content and yield in maize grain, and exploring their genetic basis will help breeders to develop high grain quality maize. Biofortification by enhanced mineral accumulation in grain through genetic improvement is an efficient way to solve global nutrient malnutrition, in which one key step is to detect the underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL). Herein, a maize recombinant inbred population (RIL) was field grown to maturity across four environments (two locations × two years). Phenotypic data for grain mineral concentration, content and yield were determined for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P). Significant effects of genotype, location and year were observed for all investigated traits. The strongest location effects were found for Zn accumulation traits probably due to distinct soil Zn availabilities across locations. Heritability (H (2)) of different traits varied with higher H (2) (72-85 %) for mineral concentration and content, and lower (48-63 %) for mineral yield. Significant positive correlations for grain concentration were revealed between several minerals. QTL analysis revealed 28, 25, and 12 QTL for mineral concentration, content and yield, respectively; and identified 8 stable QTL across at least two environments. All these QTL were assigned into 12 distinct QTL clusters. A cluster at chromosome Bin 6.07/6.08 contained 6 QTL for kernel weight, mineral concentration (Mg) and content (Zn, K, Mg, P). Another cluster at Bin 4.05/4.06 contained a stable QTL for Mn concentration, which were previously identified in other maize and rice RIL populations. These results highlighted the phenotypic and genetic performance of grain mineral accumulation, and revealed two promising chromosomal regions for genetic improvement of grain biofortification in maize.
26061689	Application of an Effective Statistical Technique for an Accurate and Powerful Mining of Quantitative Trait Loci for Rice Aroma Trait.	2015	PLoS One	When a phenotype of interest is associated with an external/internal covariate, covariate inclusion in quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses can diminish residual variation and subsequently enhance the ability of QTL detection. In the in vitro synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), the main fragrance compound in rice, the thermal processing during the Maillard-type reaction between proline and carbohydrate reduction produces a roasted, popcorn-like aroma. Hence, for the first time, we included the proline amino acid, an important precursor of 2AP, as a covariate in our QTL mapping analyses to precisely explore the genetic factors affecting natural variation for rice scent. Consequently, two QTLs were traced on chromosomes 4 and 8. They explained from 20% to 49% of the total aroma phenotypic variance. Additionally, by saturating the interval harboring the major QTL using gene-based primers, a putative allele of fgr (major genetic determinant of fragrance) was mapped in the QTL on the 8th chromosome in the interval RM223-SCU015RM (1.63 cM). These loci supported previous studies of different accessions. Such QTLs can be widely used by breeders in crop improvement programs and for further fine mapping. Moreover, no previous studies and findings were found on simultaneous assessment of the relationship among 2AP, proline and fragrance QTLs. Therefore, our findings can help further our understanding of the metabolomic and genetic basis of 2AP biosynthesis in aromatic rice.
26030903	Fine Mapping and Candidate Gene Analysis of qSTL3, a Stigma Length-Conditioning Locus in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	The efficiency of hybrid seed production can be improved by increasing the percentage of exserted stigma, which is closely related to the stigma length in rice. In the chromosome segment substitute line (CSSL) population derived from Nipponbare (recipient) and Kasalath (donor), a single CSSL (SSSL14) was found to show a longer stigma length than that of Nipponbare. The difference in stigma length between Nipponbare and SSSL14 was controlled by one locus (qSTL3). Using 7,917 individuals from the SSSL14/Nipponbare F2 population, the qSTL3 locus was delimited to a 19.8-kb region in the middle of the short arm of chromosome 3. Within the 19.8-kb chromosome region, three annotated genes (LOC_Os03g14850, LOC_Os03g14860 and LOC_Os03g14880) were found in the rice genome annotation database. According to gene sequence alignments in LOC_Os03g14850, a transition of G (Nipponbare) to A (Kasalath) was detected at the 474-bp site in CDS. The transition created a stop codon, leading to a deletion of 28 amino acids in the deduced peptide sequence in Kasalath. A T-DNA insertion mutant (05Z11CN28) of LOC_Os03g14850 showed a longer stigma length than that of wild type (Zhonghua 11), validating that LOC_Os03g14850 is the gene controlling stigma length. However, the Kasalath allele of LOC_Os03g14850 is unique because all of the alleles were the same as that of Nipponbare at the 474-bp site in the CDS of LOC_Os03g14850 among the investigated accessions with different stigma lengths. A gene-specific InDel marker LQ30 was developed for improving stigma length during rice hybrid breeding by marker-assisted selection.
26081459	Identification of cis-elements and evaluation of upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, conferring pollen-specific expression in Oryza sativa (L.) ssp. indica.	2015	Plant Reprod	KEY MESSAGE: Pollen-specific expression. Promoters comprise of various cis-regulatory elements which control development and physiology of plants by regulating gene expression. To understand the promoter specificity and also identification of functional cis-acting elements, progressive 5' deletion analysis of the promoter fragments is widely used. We have evaluated the activity of regulatory elements of 5' promoter deletion sequences of anther-specific gene OSIPP3, viz. OSIPP3-∆1 (1504 bp), OSIPP3-∆2 (968 bp), OSIPP3-∆3 (388 bp) and OSIPP3-∆4 (286 bp) through the expression of transgene GUS in rice. In silico analysis of 1504-bp sequence harboring different copy number of cis-acting regulatory elements such as POLLENLELAT52, GTGANTG10, enhancer element of LAT52 and LAT56 indicated that they were essential for high level of expression in pollen. Histochemical GUS analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that 1504- and 968-bp fragments directed GUS expression in roots and anthers, while the 388- and 286-bp fragments restricted the GUS expression to only pollen, of which 388 bp conferred strong GUS expression. Further, GUS staining analysis of different panicle development stages (P1-P6) confirmed that the GUS gene was preferentially expressed only at P6 stage (late pollen stage). The qRT-PCR analysis of GUS transcript revealed 23-fold higher expression of GUS transcript in OSIPP3-Δ1 followed by OSIPP3-Δ2 (eightfold) and OSIPP3-Δ3 (threefold) when compared to OSIPP3-Δ4. Based on our results, we proposed that among the two smaller fragments, the 388-bp upstream regulatory region could be considered as a promising candidate for pollen-specific expression of agronomically important transgenes in rice.
26123085	Defining the RNA-binding glycine-rich (RBG) gene superfamily: new insights into nomenclature, phylogeny, and evolutionary trends obtained by genome-wide comparative analysis of Arabidopsis, Chinese cabbage, rice and maize genomes.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	RNA-binding glycine-rich (RBG) proteins play diverse roles in plant growth, development, protection and genome organization. An overly broad definition for class IV glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), namely RNA-binding activity and a glycine-rich C-terminus, has resulted in many distantly related and/or non-related proteins being grouped into this class of RBGs. This definition has hampered the study of RBG evolution. In this study, we used a comparative genomic approach consisting of ortholog, homolog, synteny and phylogenetic analyses to legitimately exclude all distantly/non-related proteins from class IV GRPs and to identify 15, 22, 12 and 18 RBG proteins in Arabidopsis, Chinese cabbage, rice and maize genomes, respectively. All identified RBGs could be divided into three subclasses, namely RBGA, RBGB and RBGD, which may be derived from a common ancestor. We assigned RBGs excluded from class IV GRPs to a separate RBG superfamily. RBGs have evolved and diversified in different species via different mechanisms; segmental duplication and recombination have had major effects, with tandem duplication, intron addition/deletion and domain recombination/deletion playing minor roles. Loss and retention of duplicated RBGs after polyploidization has been species and subclass specific. For example, following recent whole-genome duplication and triplication in maize and Chinese cabbage, respectively, most duplicated copies of RBGA have been lost in maize while RBGD duplicates have been retained; in Chinese cabbage, in contrast, RBGA duplicates have been retained while RBGD duplicates have been lost. Our findings reveal fundamental information and shed new light on the structural characteristics and evolutionary dynamics of RBGs.
26091498	Structure of Importin-α from a Filamentous Fungus in Complex with a Classical Nuclear Localization Signal.	2015	PLoS One	Neurospora crassa is a filamentous fungus that has been extensively studied as a model organism for eukaryotic biology, providing fundamental insights into cellular processes such as cell signaling, growth and differentiation. To advance in the study of this multicellular organism, an understanding of the specific mechanisms for protein transport into the cell nucleus is essential. Importin-α (Imp-α) is the receptor for cargo proteins that contain specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that play a key role in the classical nuclear import pathway. Structures of Imp-α from different organisms (yeast, rice, mouse, and human) have been determined, revealing that this receptor possesses a conserved structural scaffold. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the Impα mechanism of action may vary significantly for different organisms or for different isoforms from the same organism. Therefore, structural, functional, and biophysical characterization of different Impα proteins is necessary to understand the selectivity of nuclear transport. Here, we determined the first crystal structure of an Impα from a filamentous fungus which is also the highest resolution Impα structure already solved to date (1.75 Å). In addition, we performed calorimetric analysis to determine the affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between Imp-α and the classical SV40 NLS peptide. The comparison of these data with previous studies on Impα proteins led us to demonstrate that N. crassa Imp-α possess specific features that are distinct from mammalian Imp-α but exhibit important similarities to rice Imp-α, particularly at the minor NLS binding site.
26053267	Leaf Lateral Asymmetry in Morphological and Physiological Traits of Rice Plant.	2015	PLoS One	Leaf lateral asymmetry in width and thickness has been reported previously in rice. However, the differences between the wide and narrow sides of leaf blade in other leaf morphological and physiological traits were not known. This study was conducted to quantify leaf lateral asymmetry in leaf width, leaf thickness, specific leaf weight (SLW), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration based on dry weight (Nw) and leaf area (Na), and chlorophyll meter reading (SPAD). Leaf morphological and physiological traits of the two lateral halves of the top three leaves at heading stage were measured on 23 rice varieties grown in three growing seasons in two locations. Leaf lateral asymmetry was observed in leaf width, leaf thickness, Nw, Na, and SPAD, but not in SLW. On average, the leaf width of the wide side was about 17% higher than that of the narrow side. The wide side had higher leaf thickness than the narrow side whereas the narrow side had higher Nw, Na, and SPAD than the wide side. We conclude that the narrow side of leaf blade maintained higher leaf N status than the wide side based on all N-related parameters, which implies a possibility of leaf lateral asymmetry in photosynthetic rate in rice plant.
26175622	Genome-wide indel markers shared by diverse Asian rice cultivars compared to Japanese rice cultivar 'Koshihikari'.	2015	Breed Sci	Insertion-deletion (indel) polymorphisms, such as simple sequence repeats, have been widely used as DNA markers to identify QTLs and genes and to facilitate rice breeding. Recently, next-generation sequencing has produced deep sequences that allow genome-wide detection of indels. These polymorphisms can potentially be used to develop high-accuracy polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers. Here, re-sequencing of 5 indica, 2 aus, and 3 tropical japonica cultivars and Japanese elite cultivar 'Koshihikari' was performed to extract regions containing large indels (10-51 bp) shared by diverse cultivars. To design indel markers for the discrimination of genomic regions between 'Koshihikari' and other diverse cultivars, we subtracted the indel regions detected in 'Koshihikari' from those shared in other cultivars. Two sets of indel markers, KNJ8-indel (shared in eight or more cultivars, including 'Khao Nam Jen' as a representative tropical japonica cultivar) and C5-indel (shared in five to eight cultivars), were established, with 915 and 9,899 indel regions, respectively. Validation of the two marker sets by using 23 diverse cultivars showed a high PCR success rate (≥95%) for 83.3% of the KNJ8-indel markers and 73.9% of the C5-indel markers. The marker sets will therefore be useful for the effective breeding of Japanese rice cultivars.
26191068	Genome-wide identification and expression characterization of ABCC-MRP transporters in hexaploid wheat.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The ABCC multidrug resistance associated proteins (ABCC-MRP), a subclass of ABC transporters are involved in multiple physiological processes that include cellular homeostasis, metal detoxification, and transport of glutathione-conjugates. Although they are well-studied in humans, yeast, and Arabidopsis, limited efforts have been made to address their possible role in crop like wheat. In the present work, 18 wheat ABCC-MRP proteins were identified that showed the uniform distribution with sub-families from rice and Arabidopsis. Organ-specific quantitative expression analysis of wheat ABCC genes indicated significantly higher accumulation in roots (TaABCC2, TaABCC3, and TaABCC11 and TaABCC12), stem (TaABCC1), leaves (TaABCC16 and TaABCC17), flag leaf (TaABCC14 and TaABCC15), and seeds (TaABCC6, TaABCC8, TaABCC12, TaABCC13, and TaABCC17) implicating their role in the respective tissues. Differential transcript expression patterns were observed for TaABCC genes during grain maturation speculating their role during seed development. Hormone treatment experiments indicated that some of the ABCC genes could be transcriptionally regulated during seed development. In the presence of Cd or hydrogen peroxide, distinct molecular expression of wheat ABCC genes was observed in the wheat seedlings, suggesting their possible role during heavy metal generated oxidative stress. Functional characterization of the wheat transporter, TaABCC13 a homolog of maize LPA1 confirms its role in glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway and is able to utilize adenine biosynthetic intermediates as a substrate. This is the first comprehensive inventory of wheat ABCC-MRP gene subfamily.
26220807	Nonfunctional alleles of long-day suppressor genes independently regulate flowering time.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Due to the remarkable adaptability to various environments, rice varieties with diverse flowering times have been domesticated or improved from Oryza rufipogon. Detailed knowledge of the genetic factors controlling flowering time will facilitate understanding the adaptation mechanism in cultivated rice and enable breeders to design appropriate genotypes for distinct preferences. In this study, four genes (Hd1, DTH8, Ghd7 and OsPRR37) in a rice long-day suppression pathway were collected and sequenced in 154, 74, 69 and 62 varieties of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) respectively. Under long-day conditions, varieties with nonfunctional alleles flowered significantly earlier than those with functional alleles. However, the four genes have different genetic effects in the regulation of flowering time: Hd1 and OsPRR37 are major genes that generally regulate rice flowering time for all varieties, while DTH8 and Ghd7 only regulate regional rice varieties. Geographic analysis and network studies suggested that the nonfunctional alleles of these suppression loci with regional adaptability were derived recently and independently. Alleles with regional adaptability should be taken into consideration for genetic improvement. The rich genetic variations in these four genes, which adapt rice to different environments, provide the flexibility needed for breeding rice varieties with diverse flowering times.
26222686	Metabolic Plasticity and Inter-Compartmental Interactions in Rice Metabolism: An Analysis from Reaction Deletion Study.	2015	PLoS One	More than 20% of the total caloric intake of human population comes from rice. The expression of rice genes and hence, the concentration of enzymatic proteins might vary due to several biotic and abiotic stresses. It in turn, can influence the overall metabolism and survivability of rice plant. Thus, understanding the rice cellular metabolism, its plasticity and potential readjustments under different perturbations can help rice biotechnologists to design efficient rice cultivars. Here, using the flux balance analysis (FBA) method, with the help of in-silico reaction deletion strategy, we study the metabolic plasticity of genome-scale metabolic model of rice leaf. A set of 131 reactions, essential for the production of primary biomass precursors is identified; deletion of any of them can inhibit the overall biomass production. Usability Index (IU) for the rest of the reactions are estimated and based on this parameter, they are classified into three categories-maximally-favourable, quasi-favourable and unfavourable for the primary biomass production. The lower value of 1 - IU of a reaction suggests that the cell cannot easily bypass it for biomass production. While some of the alternative paths are energetically equally efficient, others demand for higher photon. The variations in (i) ATP/NADPH ratio, (ii) exchange of metabolites through chloroplastic transporters and (iii) total biomass production are also presented here. Mutual metabolic dependencies of different cellular compartments are also demonstrated.
26176782	Generation of Wheat Transcription Factor FOX Rice Lines and Systematic Screening for Salt and Osmotic Stress Tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	Transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stress. In this study, we collected 1,455 full-length (FL) cDNAs of TFs, representing 45 families, from wheat and its relatives Triticum urartu, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum carthlicum, and Triticum aestivum. More than 15,000 T0 TF FOX (Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressing) rice lines were generated; of these, 10,496 lines set seeds. About 14.88% of the T0 plants showed obvious phenotypic changes. T1 lines (5,232 lines) were screened for salt and osmotic stress tolerance using 150 mM NaCl and 20% (v/v) PEG-4000, respectively. Among them, five lines (591, 746, 1647, 1812, and J4065) showed enhanced salt stress tolerance, five lines (591, 746, 898, 1078, and 1647) showed enhanced osmotic stress tolerance, and three lines (591, 746, and 1647) showed both salt and osmotic stress tolerance. Further analysis of the T-DNA flanking sequences showed that line 746 over-expressed TaEREB1, line 898 over-expressed TabZIPD, and lines 1812 and J4065 over-expressed TaOBF1a and TaOBF1b, respectively. The enhanced salt and osmotic stress tolerance of lines 898 and 1812 was confirmed by retransformation of the respective genes. Our results demonstrate that a heterologous FOX system may be used as an alternative genetic resource for the systematic functional analysis of the wheat genome.
26251886	Overexpression of a CYP94 family gene CYP94C2b increases internode length and plant height in rice.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Plant growth is controlled by intrinsic developmental programmes and environmental cues. Jasmonate (JA) has important roles in both processes, by regulating cell division and differentiation, as well as in defense responses and senescence. We report an increase in rice plant height caused by overexpression of a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP94C2b, which promoted deactivation of JA-Ile. The height increase occurred through enhanced elongation of internodes in the absence of concomitant cell elongation, unlike previous findings with coi1 knock-down plants. Thus, modulating JA metabolism can increase the number of elongated cells in an internode. Based on these and previous findings, we discuss the difference in the effects of CYP94C2b overexpression vs. coi1 knock-down.
26206233	A transcriptome-wide study on the microRNA- and the Argonaute 1-enriched small RNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in plant leaf senescence.	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Leaf senescence is an important physiological process during the plant life cycle. However, systemic studies on the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) are lacking. Besides, whether other Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-enriched small RNAs (sRNAs) play regulatory roles in leaf senescence remains unclear. In this study, a total of 5,123 and 1,399 AGO1-enriched sRNAs, excluding miRNAs, were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. After retrieving SAGs from the Leaf Senescence Database, all of the AGO1-enriched sRNAs and the miRBase-registered miRNAs of these two plants were included for target identification. Supported by degradome signatures, 200 regulatory pairs involving 120 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 40 SAGs, and 266 regulatory pairs involving 64 miRNAs and 42 SAGs were discovered in Arabidopsis. Moreover, 13 genes predicted to interact with some of the above-identified target genes at protein level were validated as regulated by 17 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and ten miRNAs in Arabidopsis. In rice, only one SAG was targeted by three AGO1-enriched sRNAs, and one SAG was targeted by miR395. However, five AGO1-enriched sRNAs were conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. Target genes conserved between the two plants were identified for three of the above five sRNAs, pointing to the conserved roles of these regulatory pairs in leaf senescence or other developmental procedures. Novel targets were discovered for three of the five AGO1-enriched sRNAs in rice, indicating species-specific functions of these sRNA-target pairs. These results could advance our understanding of the sRNA-involved molecular processes modulating leaf senescence.
26291919	Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis ameliorates the optimum quantum yield of photosystem II and reduces non-photochemical quenching in rice plants subjected to salt stress.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Rice is the most important food crop in the world and is a primary source of food for more than half of the world population. However, salinity is considered the most common abiotic stress reducing its productivity. Soil salinity inhibits photosynthetic processes, which can induce an over-reduction of the reaction centres in photosystem II (PSII), damaging the photosynthetic machinery. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis may improve host plant tolerance to salinity, but it is not clear how the AM symbiosis affects the plant photosynthetic capacity, particularly the efficiency of PSII. This study aimed at determining the influence of the AM symbiosis on the performance of PSII in rice plants subjected to salinity. Photosynthetic activity, plant gas-exchange parameters, accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and rubisco activity and gene expression were also measured in order to analyse comprehensively the response of the photosynthetic processes to AM symbiosis and salinity. Results showed that the AM symbiosis enhanced the actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and reduced the quantum yield of non-photochemical quenching in rice plants subjected to salinity. AM rice plants maintained higher net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate than nonAM plants. Thus, we propose that AM rice plants had a higher photochemical efficiency for CO2 fixation and solar energy utilization and this increases plant salt tolerance by preventing the injury to the photosystems reaction centres and by allowing a better utilization of light energy in photochemical processes. All these processes translated into higher photosynthetic and rubisco activities in AM rice plants and improved plant biomass production under salinity.
26263516	Stress-responsive expression patterns and functional characterization of cold shock domain proteins in cabbage (Brassica rapa) under abiotic stress conditions.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Although the functional roles of cold shock domain proteins (CSDPs) have been demonstrated during the growth, development, and stress adaptation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), the functions of CSDPs in other plants species, including cabbage (Brassica rapa), are largely unknown. To gain insight into the roles of CSDPs in cabbage under stress conditions, the genes encoding CSDPs in cabbage were isolated, and the functional roles of CSDPs in response to environmental stresses were analyzed. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the levels of BrCSDP transcripts increased during cold, salt, or drought stress, as well as upon ABA treatment. Among the five BrCSDP genes found in the cabbage genome, one CSDP (BRU12051), named BrCSDP3, was unique in that it is localized to the chloroplast as well as to the nucleus. Ectopic expression of BrCSDP3 in Arabidopsis resulted in accelerated seed germination and better seedling growth compared to the wild-type plants under high salt or dehydration stress conditions, and in response to ABA treatment. BrCSDP3 did not affect the splicing of intron-containing genes and processing of rRNAs in the chloroplast. BrCSDP3 had the ability to complement RNA chaperone-deficient Escherichia coli mutant cells under low temperatures as well as DNA- and RNA-melting abilities, suggesting that it possesses RNA chaperone activity. Taken together, these results suggest that BrCSDP3, harboring RNA chaperone activity, plays a role as a positive regulator in seed germination and seedling growth under stress conditions.
26175353	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	2015	J Exp Bot	Heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-mediated abscisic acid (ABA) and drought-stress responses have been documented in numerous plant species. However, our understanding of the function of rice G-protein subunits in ABA signalling and drought tolerance is limited. In this study, the function of G-protein subunits in ABA response and drought resistance in rice plants was explored. It was found that the transcription level of qPE9-1 (rice Gγ subunit) gradually decreased with increasing ABA concentration and the lack of qPE9-1 showed an enhanced drought tolerance in rice plants. In contrast, mRNA levels of RGB1 (rice Gβ subunit) were significantly upregulated by ABA treatment and the lack of RGB1 led to reduced drought tolerance. Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions. Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses.
26025535	Three WRKY transcription factors additively repress abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells.	2015	Plant Sci	Members of the WRKY transcription factor superfamily are essential for the regulation of many plant pathways. Functional redundancy due to duplications of WRKY transcription factors, however, complicates genetic analysis by allowing single-mutant plants to maintain wild-type phenotypes. Our analyses indicate that three group I WRKY genes, OsWRKY24, -53, and -70, act in a partially redundant manner. All three showed characteristics of typical WRKY transcription factors: each localized to nuclei and yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that they all bind to W-boxes, including those present in their own promoters. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated that the expression levels of the three WRKY genes varied in the different tissues tested. Particle bombardment-mediated transient expression analyses indicated that all three genes repress the GA and ABA signaling in a dosage-dependent manner. Combination of all three WRKY genes showed additive antagonism of ABA and GA signaling. These results suggest that these WRKY proteins function as negative transcriptional regulators of GA and ABA signaling. However, different combinations of these WRKY genes can lead to varied strengths in suppression of their targets.
26138891	Development of certified matrix-based reference material of genetically modified rice event TT51-1 for real-time PCR quantification.	2015	Anal Bioanal Chem	In 2009, the genetically modified (GM) rice event TT51-1 with an engineered insect resistance trait became the first GM rice event to be granted certification for safe production in China, and its derivative lines Bt 63 and Huahui No.1 are expected to be commercialized soon. The development of certified reference material (CRM) for TT51-1 is necessary to monitor and inspect the TT51-1 event and its derivates. In this work, we developed four matrix-based TT51-1 rice CRMs (TT51-1a, TT51-1b, TT51-1c, and TT51-1d) with different TT51-1 mass fraction ratios by blending seed powders of homozygous TT51-1 and its recipient cultivar Minghui 63. The between-bottle homogeneity and the within-bottle homogeneity were tested, and good results were obtained. The potential degradation during transportation and shelf life were evaluated, and demonstrated an expiration period of at least 36 months. The characterization values of the four TT51-1 CRMs based on the mass fraction ratio were 1000.000 ± 51.430 g/kg, 49.940 ± 4.620 g/kg, 9.990 ± 1.110 g/kg, and 4.990 ± 0.620 g/kg, respectively. The characterization values based on the copy number ratio were certified by digital PCR analysis as 97.442 ± 5.253 %, 4.851 ± 0.486 %, 1.042 ± 0.135 %, and 0.556 ± 0.073 %, respectively. These results suggested that the TT51-1 matrix-based CRMs developed are of high quality and can be used as potential calibrators for TT51-1 GM rice inspection and monitoring.
26197316	Differential Antioxidant Responses and Perturbed Porphyrin Biosynthesis after Exposure to Oxyfluorfen and Methyl Viologen in Oryza sativa.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	We compared antioxidant responses and regulation of porphyrin metabolism in rice plants treated with oxyfluorfen (OF) or methyl viologen (MV). Plants treated with MV exhibited not only greater increases in conductivity and malondialdehyde but also a greater decline in Fv/Fm, compared to plants treated with OF. MV-treated plants had greater increases in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as transcript levels of SODA and CATA than OF-treated plants after 28 h of the treatments, whereas increases in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and transcript levels of APXA and APXB were greater in OF-treated plants. Both OF- and MV-treated plants resulted in not only down-regulation of most genes involved in porphyrin biosynthesis but also disappearance of Mg-porphyrins during the late stage of photooxidative stress. By contrast, up-regulation of heme oxygenase 2 (HO2) is possibly part of an efficient antioxidant response to compensate photooxidative damage in both treatments. Our data show that down-regulated biosynthesis and degradation dynamics of porphyrin intermediates have important roles in photoprotection of plants from perturbed porphyrin biosynthesis and photosynthetic electron transport. This study suggests that porphyrin scavenging as well as strong antioxidative activities are required for mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production under photooxidative stress caused by OF and MV.
26135744	Molecular Cloning and mRNA Expression of Heat Shock Protein Genes and Their Response to Cadmium Stress in the Grasshopper Oxya chinensis.	2015	PLoS One	Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are highly conserved molecular chaperones that are synthesized in response to stress. In this study, we cloned the full-length sequences of the Grp78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp40 genes from the Chinese rice grasshopper Oxya chinensis. The full-length cDNA sequences of OcGrp78, OcHsp70, OcHsp90, and OcHsp40 contain open reading frames of 1947, 1920, 2172, and 1042 bp that encode proteins of 649, 640, 724, and 347 amino acids, respectively. Fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to quantify the relative transcript levels of these Hsp genes in different tissues and developmental stages. The mRNAs encoding these four Hsp genes were present at all developmental stages and in all tissues examined but were expressed at varying levels. Additionally, we investigated the mRNA expression profiles of these four Hsps in O. chinensis subjected to Cadmium (Cd) stress. OcGrp78, OcHsp70, OcHsp90, and OcHsp40 mRNA expression was induced under acute Cd stress; the levels reached a maximum within a short time (6 h), were reduced significantly at 12 h, and were lowered to or below control levels by 48 h. Regarding induction efficiency, OcHsp70 was the most sensitive gene to acute Cd stress. Chronic Cd exposure showed that dietary Cd treatment induced increased OcGrp78, OcHsp90, and OcHsp40 expression. However, dietary Cd induced a significant reduction of OcHsp70 expression. In the period tested, no significant difference in the mortality of the grasshoppers was observed. Our results suggest that these four Hsps genes, especially OcHsp70, are sensitive to acute Cd stress and could be used as molecular markers for toxicology studies. However, our results also indicate that OcHsp70 is not suitable for use as a molecular marker of chronic Cd contamination.
26133688	Increases in the longevity of desiccation-phase developing rice seeds: response to high-temperature drying depends on harvest moisture content.	2015	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have suggested that the drying conditions routinely used by genebanks may not be optimal for subsequent seed longevity. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of hot-air drying and low-temperature drying on subsequent seed longevity for 20 diverse rice accessions and to consider how factors related to seed production history might influence the results.

METHODS: Seeds of rice, Oryza sativa, were produced according to normal regeneration procedures at IRRI. They were harvested at different times [harvest date and days after anthesis (DAA), once for each accession] and dried either in a drying room (DR; 15 % relative humidity, 15 °C) or in a flat-bed heated-air batch dryer (BD; 45 °C, 8 h d(-1)) for up to six daily cycles followed by drying in the DR. Relative longevity was assessed by storage at 10·9 % moisture content and 45 °C.

KEY RESULTS: Initial drying in the BD resulted in significantly greater longevity compared with the DR for 14 accessions (seed lots): the period of time for viability to fall to 50 % for seeds dried in the BD as a percentage of that for seeds dried throughout in the DR varied between 1.3 and 372·2 % for these accessions. The seed lots that responded the most were those that were harvested earlier in the season and at higher moisture content. Drying in the BD did not reduce subsequent longevity compared with DR drying for any of the remaining accessions.

CONCLUSIONS: Seeds harvested at a moisture content where, according to the moisture desorption isotherm, they could still be metabolically active (>16·2 %) may be in the first stage of the post-mass maturity, desiccation phase of seed development and thus able to increase longevity in response to hot-air drying. The genebank standards regarding seed drying for rice and, perhaps, for other tropical species should therefore be reconsidered.
26183952	ASR5 is involved in the regulation of miRNA expression in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The work describes an ASR knockdown transcriptomic analysis by deep sequencing of rice root seedlings and the transactivation of ASR cis-acting elements in the upstream region of a MIR gene. MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression that guide post-transcriptional control of plant development and responses to environmental stresses. ASR (ABA, Stress and Ripening) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors with key roles in different biological processes. In rice, ASR proteins have been suggested to participate in the regulation of stress response genes. This work describes the transcriptomic analysis by deep sequencing two libraries, comparing miRNA abundance from the roots of transgenic ASR5 knockdown rice seedlings with that of the roots of wild-type non-transformed rice seedlings. Members of 59 miRNA families were detected, and 276 mature miRNAs were identified. Our analysis detected 112 miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the two libraries. A predicted inverse correlation between miR167abc and its target gene (LOC_Os07g29820) was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Protoplast transactivation assays showed that ASR5 is able to recognize binding sites upstream of the MIR167a gene and drive its expression in vivo. Together, our data establish a comparative study of miRNAome profiles and is the first study to suggest the involvement of ASR proteins in miRNA gene regulation.
26161553	Examining Two Sets of Introgression Lines in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Reveals Favorable Alleles that Improve Grain Zn and Fe Concentrations.	2015	PLoS One	In the modern world, the grain mineral concentration (GMC) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) not only includes important micronutrient elements such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), but it also includes toxic heavy metal elements, especially cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). To date, the genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of GMC, especially the genetic background and G × E effects of GMC, remain largely unknown. In this study, we adopted two sets of backcross introgression lines (BILs) derived from IR75862 (a Zn-dense rice variety) as the donor parent and two elite indica varieties, Ce258 and Zhongguangxiang1, as recurrent parents to detect QTL affecting GMC traits including Fe, Zn, Cd and Pb concentrations in two environments. We detected a total of 22 loci responsible for GMC traits, which are distributed on all 12 rice chromosomes except 5, 9 and 10. Six genetic overlap (GO) regions affecting multiple elements were found, in which most donor alleles had synergistic effects on GMC. Some toxic heavy metal-independent loci (such as qFe1, qFe2 and qZn12) and some regions that have opposite genetic effects on micronutrient (Fe and Zn) and heavy metal element (Pb) concentrations (such as GO-IV) may be useful for marker-assisted biofortification breeding in rice. We discuss three important points affecting biofortification breeding efforts in rice, including correlations between different GMC traits, the genetic background effect and the G × E effect.
26147403	Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.	2015	New Phytol	Rice cultivars have been adapted to favorable ecological regions and cropping seasons. Although several heading date genes have separately made contributions to this adaptation, the roles of gene combinations are still unclear. We employed a map-based cloning approach to isolate a heading date gene, which coordinated the interaction between Ghd7 and Ghd8 to greatly delay rice heading. We resequenced these three genes in a germplasm collection to analyze natural variation. Map-based cloning demonstrated that the gene largely affecting the interaction between Ghd7 and Ghd8 was Hd1. Natural variation analysis showed that a combination of loss-of-function alleles of Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 contributes to the expansion of rice cultivars to higher latitudes; by contrast, a combination of pre-existing strong alleles of Ghd7, Ghd8 and functional Hd1 (referred as SSF) is exclusively found where ancestral Asian cultivars originated. Other combinations have comparatively larger favorable ecological scopes and acceptable grain yield. Our results indicate that the combinations of Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential in rice cultivars. Breeding varieties with the SSF combination are recommended for tropical regions to fully utilize available energy and light resources and thus produce greater yields.
26141567	Retention of functional genes for S19 ribosomal protein in both the mitochondrion and nucleus for over 60 million years.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Ribosomal protein genes occasionally undergo successful migration from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in flowering plants and we previously presented evidence that the S19 ribosomal protein gene (rps19) had been transferred to the nucleus in the common ancestor of Poaceae grasses. In many lineages, the mitochondrial copy was subsequently lost or pseudogenized, although in rice it was retained and the nuclear copy lost. We have now determined that functional rps19 genes are present in both the mitochondrion and nucleus in brome grass (Bromus inermis). The mitochondrion-located rps19 gene, which is immediately downstream of an rpl2 pseudogene, is transcribed and edited. The nuclear-located rps19 gene is also actively expressed and it possesses the same intron-containing hsp70-type presequence as its counterparts in other grasses, as well as shared derived amino acids within the S19 core. We conclude that this brome rps19 gene is derived from the same transfer event that occurred in the common ancestor of grasses at least 60 million years ago. In the oat lineage, a subsequent exon shuffling-type event has resulted in novel amino-terminal sequences replacing part of the hsp70 presequence, and in the barley lineage, there has been an additional DNA-mediated transfer of the mitochondrial rps19 gene and its flanking sequences, followed by relatively recent loss of the mitochondrion-located copy. The prolonged persistence of functional copies in both compartments, as evidenced by present-day brome, raises interesting questions about their respective roles.
26202548	Laser microdissection-based gene expression analysis in the aleurone layer and starchy endosperm of developing rice caryopses in the early storage phase.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice endosperm is composed of aleurone cells in the outermost layers and starchy endosperm cells in the inner part. The aleurone layer accumulates lipids, whereas starchy endosperm mainly accumulates starch. During the ripening stage, the starch accumulation rate is known to be asynchronous, depending on the position of the starchy endosperm. Different physiological and molecular mechanisms are hypothesized to underlie the qualitative and quantitative differences in storage products among developing rice endosperm tissues.

RESULTS: Target cells in aleurone layers and starchy endosperm were isolated by laser microdissection (LM), and RNAs were extracted from each endosperm tissue in the early storage phase. Genes important for carbohydrate metabolism in developing endosperm were analyzed using qRT-PCR, and some of the genes showed specific localization in either tissue of the endosperm. Aleurone layer-specific gene expression of a sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, suggested that the gene functions in sucrose uptake into aleurone cells. The expression levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPL2 and AGPS2b) in each endosperm tissue spatially corresponded to the distribution of starch granules differentially observed among endosperm tissues. By contrast, expressions of genes for sucrose cleavage-hexokinase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and phosphoglucomutase-were observed in all endosperm tissues tested. Aleurone cells predominantly expressed mRNAs for the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This finding was supported by the presence of oxygen (8 % concentration) and large numbers of mitochondria in the aleurone layers. In contrast, oxygen was absent and only a few mitochondria were observed in the starchy endosperm. Genes for carbon fixation and the GS/GOGAT cycle were expressed highly in aleurone cells compared to starchy endosperm.

CONCLUSIONS: The transcript level of AGPL2 and AGPS2b encoding ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase appears to regulate the asynchronous development of starch granules in developing caryopses. Aleurone cells appear to generate, at least partially, ATP via aerobic respiration as observed from specific expression of identified genes and large numbers of mitochondria. The LM-based expression analysis and physiological experiments provide insight into the molecular basis of the spatial and nutritional differences between rice aleurone cells and starchy endosperm cells.
26154950	Discrimination of Transgenic Rice containing the Cry1Ab Protein using Terahertz Spectroscopy and Chemometrics.	2015	Sci Rep	Spectroscopic techniques combined with chemometrics methods have proven to be effective tools for the discrimination of objects with similar properties. In this work, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) combined with discriminate analysis (DA) and principal component analysis (PCA) with derivative pretreatments was performed to differentiate transgenic rice (Hua Hui 1, containing the Cry1Ab protein) from its parent (Ming Hui 63). Both rice samples and the Cry1Ab protein were ground and pressed into pellets for terahertz (THz) measurements. The resulting time-domain spectra were transformed into frequency-domain spectra, and then, the transmittances of the rice and Cry1Ab protein were calculated. By applying the first derivative of the THz spectra in conjunction with the DA model, the discrimination of transgenic from non-transgenic rice was possible with accuracies up to 89.4% and 85.0% for the calibration set and validation set, respectively. The results indicated that THz spectroscopic techniques and chemometrics methods could be new feasible ways to differentiate transgenic rice.
26141566	Genetic analysis of durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in the rice accession Gigante Vercelli identified two blast resistance loci.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Rice cultivars exhibiting durable resistance to blast, the most important rice fungal disease provoking up to 30 % of rice losses, are very rare and searching for sources of such a resistance represents a priority for rice-breeding programs. To this aim we analyzed Gigante Vercelli (GV) and Vialone Nano (VN), two temperate japonica rice cultivars in Italy displaying contrasting response to blast, with GV showing a durable and broad-spectrum resistance, whereas VN being highly susceptible. An SSR-based genetic map developed using a GV × VN population segregating for blast resistance identified two blast resistance loci, localized to the long arm of chromosomes 1 and 4 explaining more than 78 % of the observed phenotypic variation for blast resistance. The pyramiding of two blast resistance QTLs was therefore involved in the observed durable resistance in GV. Mapping data were integrated with information obtained from RNA-seq expression profiling of all classes of resistance protein genes (resistance gene analogs, RGAs) and with the map position of known cloned or mapped blast resistance genes to search candidates for the GV resistant response. A co-localization of RGAs with the LOD peak or the marker interval of the chromosome 1 QTL was highlighted and a valuable tool for selecting the resistance gene during breeding programs was developed. Comparative analysis with known blast resistance genes revealed co-positional relationships between the chromosome 1 QTL with the Pi35/Pish blast resistance alleles and showed that the chromosome 4 QTL represents a newly identified blast resistance gene. The present genetic analysis has therefore allowed the identification of two blast resistance loci in the durable blast-resistant rice cultivar GV and tools for molecular selection of these resistance genes.
26134138	De novo Transcriptome Assembly of Common Wild Rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) and Discovery of Drought-Response Genes in Root Tissue Based on Transcriptomic Data.	2015	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The perennial O. rufipogon (common wild rice), which is considered to be the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice species, contains many useful genetic resources, including drought resistance genes. However, few studies have identified the drought resistance and tissue-specific genes in common wild rice.

RESULTS: In this study, transcriptome sequencing libraries were constructed, including drought-treated roots (DR) and control leaves (CL) and roots (CR). Using Illumina sequencing technology, we generated 16.75 million bases of high-quality sequence data for common wild rice and conducted de novo assembly and annotation of genes without prior genome information. These reads were assembled into 119,332 unigenes with an average length of 715 bp. A total of 88,813 distinct sequences (74.42% of unigenes) significantly matched known genes in the NCBI NT database. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that 3617 genes were up-regulated and 4171 genes were down-regulated in the CR library compared with the CL library. Among the DEGs, 535 genes were expressed in roots but not in shoots. A similar comparison between the DR and CR libraries showed that 1393 genes were up-regulated and 315 genes were down-regulated in the DR library compared with the CR library. Finally, 37 genes that were specifically expressed in roots were screened after comparing the DEGs identified in the above-described analyses.

CONCLUSION: This study provides a transcriptome sequence resource for common wild rice plants and establishes a digital gene expression profile of wild rice plants under drought conditions using the assembled transcriptome data as a reference. Several tissue-specific and drought-stress-related candidate genes were identified, representing a fully characterized transcriptome and providing a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies in plants.
26176552	Genome Wide Association Mapping for Arabinoxylan Content in a Collection of Tetraploid Wheats.	2015	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Arabinoxylans (AXs) are major components of plant cell walls in bread wheat and are important in bread-making and starch extraction. Furthermore, arabinoxylans are components of soluble dietary fibre that has potential health-promoting effects in human nutrition. Despite their high value for human health, few studies have been carried out on the genetics of AX content in durum wheat.

RESULTS: The genetic variability of AX content was investigated in a set of 104 tetraploid wheat genotypes and regions attributable to AX content were identified through a genome wide association study (GWAS). The amount of arabinoxylan, expressed as percentage (w/w) of the dry weight of the kernel, ranged from 1.8% to 5.5% with a mean value of 4.0%. The GWAS revealed a total of 37 significant marker-trait associations (MTA), identifying 19 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with AX content. The highest number of MTAs was identified on chromosome 5A (seven), where three QTL regions were associated with AX content, while the lowest number of MTAs was detected on chromosomes 2B and 4B, where only one MTA identified a single locus. Conservation of synteny between SNP marker sequences and the annotated genes and proteins in Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor allowed the identification of nine QTL coincident with candidate genes. These included a glycosyl hydrolase GH35, which encodes Gal7 and a glucosyltransferase GT31 on chromosome 1A; a cluster of GT1 genes on chromosome 2B that includes TaUGT1 and cisZog1; a glycosyl hydrolase that encodes a CelC gene on chromosome 3A; Ugt12887 and TaUGT1genes on chromosome 5A; a (1,3)-β-D-glucan synthase (Gsl12 gene) and a glucosyl hydrolase (Cel8 gene) on chromosome 7A.

CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies significant MTAs for the AX content in the grain of tetraploid wheat genotypes. We propose that these may be used for molecular breeding of durum wheat varieties with higher soluble fibre content.
26310142	Roles of DgD14 in regulation of shoot branching in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum 'Jinba').	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Shoot branching plays an important role in determining plant architecture. Strigolactones (SLs) negatively regulate shoot branching, and can respond to conditions of low or absent phosphate or nitrogen. The D14 gene is a probable candidate as an SL receptor in rice, petunia, and Arabidopsis. To investigate the roles of D14 in shoot branching of chrysanthemum, we isolated the D14 homolog DgD14. Functional analysis showed that DgD14 was a nuclear-localized protein, and restored the phenotype of Arabidopsis d14-1. Exogenous SL (GR24) could down-regulate DgD14 expression, but this effect could be overridden by apical auxin application. Decapitation could down-regulate DgD14 expression, but this effect could be restored by exogenous auxin. In addition, DgD14 transcripts produced rapid responses in shoot and root under conditions of phosphate absence, but only a mild variation in bud and stem with low nitrogen treatment. Indistinct reductions of P levels in shoot were observed in plants grown under low nitrogen conditions. The absence of phosphate and low levels of nitrogen negatively affected plant growth. These results demonstrate that P levels in shoot had a close relationship with phosphate, whereas nitrogen did not directly regulate DgD14 expression in shoot. Taken together, these results demonstrated that DgD14 was the functional strigolactone signaling component in chrysanthemum.
26172549	Development of Selectable Marker-Free Transgenic Rice Plants with Enhanced Seed Tocopherol Content through FLP/FRT-Mediated Spontaneous Auto-Excision.	2015	PLoS One	Development of marker-free transgenic plants is a technical alternative for avoiding concerns about the safety of selectable marker genes used in genetically modified (GM) crops. Here, we describe the construction of a spontaneous self-excision binary vector using an oxidative stress-inducible modified FLP/FRT system and its successful application to produce marker-free transgenic rice plants with enhanced seed tocopherol content. To generate selectable marker-free transgenic rice plants, we constructed a binary vector using the hpt selectable marker gene and the rice codon-optimized FLP (mFLP) gene under the control of an oxidative stress-inducible promoter between two FRT sites, along with multiple cloning sites for convenient cloning of genes of interest. Using this pCMF binary vector with the NtTC gene, marker-free T1 transgenic rice plants expressing NtTC were produced by Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation using hygromycin as a selective agent, followed by segregation of selectable marker genes. Furthermore, α-, γ-, and total tocopherol levels were significantly increased in seeds of the marker-free transgenic TC line compared with those of wild-type plants. Thus, this spontaneous auto-excision system, incorporating an oxidative stress-inducible mFLP/FRT system to eliminate the selectable marker gene, can be easily adopted and used to efficiently generate marker-free transgenic rice plants. Moreover, nutritional enhancement of rice seeds through elevation of tocopherol content coupled with this marker-free strategy may improve human health and public acceptance of GM rice.
26136269	Map-based cloning and characterization of BPH29, a B3 domain-containing recessive gene conferring brown planthopper resistance in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) production, essential for global food security, is threatened by the brown planthopper (BPH). The breeding of host-resistant crops is an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for pest control, but few resistance gene resources have thus far been cloned. An indica rice introgression line RBPH54, derived from wild rice Oryza rufipogon, has been identified with sustainable resistance to BPH, which is governed by recessive alleles at two loci. In this study, a map-based cloning approach was used to fine-map one resistance gene locus to a 24kb region on the short arm of chromosome 6. Through genetic analysis and transgenic experiments, BPH29, a resistance gene containing a B3 DNA-binding domain, was cloned. The tissue specificity of BPH29 is restricted to vascular tissue, the location of BPH attack. In response to BPH infestation, RBPH54 activates the salicylic acid signalling pathway and suppresses the jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent pathway, similar to plant defence responses to biotrophic pathogens. The cloning and characterization of BPH29 provides insights into molecular mechanisms of plant-insect interactions and should facilitate the breeding of rice host-resistant varieties.
26197925	Novel function of a putative MOC1 ortholog associated with spikelet number per spike in common wheat.	2015	Sci Rep	Axillary meristems play an important role in determining final plant architecture and floral structures. Tomato Ls, Arabidopsis LAS and rice MOC1 are orthologous genes regulating axillary meristem initiation and outgrowth. Their functions are generally conserved but the functional specificities are divergent among species. Obvious differences between rice panicles and wheat spikes suggest the divergent functions of MOC1 and its wheat ortholog. We show that TaMOC1 might be involved in wheat spikelet development. TaMOC1 is a typical nucleus localized protein with transcriptional activation abilities. The variable N-termini of TaMOC1 protein is necessary for transcriptional activation. TaMOC1 is highly expressed in ears with length of 2, 3 and 6 cm. Significant associations between the TaMOC1-7A haplotype and spikelet number per spike were observed in ten environments over 3 years and 2 sites. TaMOC1-7A HapH, a favored haplotype acquired during wheat polyploidization, may make a positive contribution to spikelet number per spike. Based on evolutionary analysis, geographic distribution and frequency changes, TaMOC1-7A HapH might be associated with wheat domestication and Chinese wheat breeding history. The pyramiding favorable alleles of TaMOC1-7A HapH and TaSnRK2.10 (C, associated with higher TGW) can improve both spikelet number per spike and TGW simultaneously.
26177065	A phage display-selected peptide inhibitor of Agrobacterium vitis polygalacturonase.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Agrobacterium vitis, the causal agent of crown gall of grapevine, is a threat to viticulture worldwide. A major virulence factor of this pathogen is polygalacturonase, an enzyme that degrades pectin components of the xylem cell wall. A single gene encodes for the polygalacturonase gene. Disruption of the polygalacturonase gene results in a mutant that is less pathogenic and produces significantly fewer root lesions on grapevines. Thus, the identification of peptides or proteins that could inhibit the activity of polygalacturonase could be part of a strategy for the protection of plants against this pathogen. A phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library was used to isolate peptides with a high binding affinity to A. vitis polygalacturonase. These peptides showed sequence similarity to regions of Oryza sativa (EMS66324, Japonica) and Triticum urartu (NP_001054402, wild wheat) polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs). Furthermore, these panning experiments identified a peptide, SVTIHHLGGGS, which was able to reduce A. vitis polygalacturonase activity by 35% in vitro. Truncation studies showed that the IHHL motif alone is sufficient to inhibit A. vitis polygalacturonase activity.
26129955	Saline-induced changes of epicuticular waxy layer on the Puccinellia tenuiflora and Oryza sativa leave surfaces.	2015	Biol Res	BACKGROUND: The epicuticular waxy layer of plant leaves enhances the extreme environmental stress tolerance. However, the relationship between waxy layer and saline tolerance was not established well. The epicuticular waxy layer of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied under the NaHCO3 stresses. In addition, strong saline tolerance Puccinellia tenuiflora was chosen for comparative studies.

RESULTS: Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that there were significant changes in waxy morphologies of the rice epicuticular surfaces, while no remarkable changes in those of P. tenuiflora epicuticular surfaces. The NaHCO3-induced morphological changes of the rice epicuticular surfaces appeared as enlarged silica cells, swollen corns-shapes and leaked salt columns under high stress. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopic profiles supported that the changes were caused by significant increment and localization of [Na(+)] and [Cl(-)] in the shoot. Atomic absorption spectra showed that [Na(+)]shoot/[Na(+)]root for P. tenuiflora maintained stable as the saline stress increased, but that for rice increased significantly.

CONCLUSION: In rice, NaHCO3 stress induced localization and accumulation of [Na(+)] and [Cl(-)] appeared as the enlarged silica cells (MSC), the swollen corns (S-C), and the leaked columns (C), while no significant changes in P. tenuiflora.
26187409	A single SNP in NRT1.1B has a major impact on nitrogen use efficiency in rice.	2015	Sci China Life Sci	
26143254	A Universal Positive-Negative Selection System for Gene Targeting in Plants Combining an Antibiotic Resistance Gene and Its Antisense RNA.	2015	Plant Physiol	Gene targeting (GT) is a useful technology for accurate genome engineering in plants. A reproducible approach based on a positive-negative selection system using hygromycin resistance and the diphtheria toxin A subunit gene as positive and negative selection markers, respectively, is now available. However, to date, this selection system has been applied exclusively in rice (Oryza sativa). To establish a universally applicable positive-negative GT system in plants, we designed a selection system using a combination of neomycin phosphotransferaseII (nptII) and an antisense nptII construct. The concomitant transcription of both sense and antisense nptII suppresses significantly the level of expression of the sense nptII gene, and transgenic calli and plants become sensitive to the antibiotic geneticin. In addition, we were able to utilize the sense nptII gene as a positive selection marker and the antisense nptII construct as a negative selection marker for knockout of the endogenous rice genes Waxy and 33-kD globulin through GT, although negative selection with this system is relatively less efficient compared with diphtheria toxin A subunit. The approach developed here, with some additional improvements, could be applied as a universal selection system for the enrichment of GT cells in several plant species.
26142419	Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Leaf morphology, particularly in crop, is one of the most important agronomic traits because it influences the yield through the manipulation of photosynthetic capacity and transpiration. To understand the regulatory mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, an Oryza sativa dominant mutant, rolled and erect leaf 1 (rel1) has been characterized. This mutant has a predominant rolled leaf, increased leaf angle, and reduced plant height phenotype that results in a reduction in grain yield. Electron microscope observations indicated that the leaf incurvations of rel1 dominant mutants result from the alteration of the size and number of bulliform cells. Molecular cloning revealed that the rel1 dominant mutant phenotype is caused by the activation of the REL1 gene, which encodes a novel unknown protein, despite its high degree of conservation among monocot plants. Moreover, the downregulation of the REL1 gene in the rel1 dominant mutant restored the phenotype of this dominant mutant. Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending. Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development. Nevertheless, the responsiveness of both rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing plants to exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) was reduced. Moreover, transcript levels of BR response genes in the rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing lines were significantly altered. Additionally, seven REL1-interacting proteins were also identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen. Taken together, these findings suggest that REL1 regulates leaf morphology, particularly in leaf rolling and bending, through the coordination of BR signalling transduction.
26258135	Genetic Variation, Heritability, and Diversity Analysis of Upland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Genotypes Based on Quantitative Traits.	2015	Biomed Res Int	Upland rice is important for sustainable crop production to meet future food demands. The expansion in area of irrigated rice faces limitations due to water scarcity resulting from climate change. Therefore, this research aimed to identify potential genotypes and suitable traits of upland rice germplasm for breeding programmes. Forty-three genotypes were evaluated in a randomised complete block design with three replications. All genotypes exhibited a wide and significant variation for 22 traits. The highest phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation was recorded for the number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g). The highest heritability was found for photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO₂, and number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g). Cluster analysis based on 22 traits grouped the 43 rice genotypes into five clusters. Cluster II was the largest and consisted of 20 genotypes mostly originating from the Philippines. The first four principle components of 22 traits accounted for about 72% of the total variation and indicated a wide variation among the genotypes. The selected best trait of the number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g), which showed high heritability and high genetic advance, could be used as a selection criterion for hybridisation programmes in the future.
26177332	Waterlogging and submergence stress: affects and acclimation.	2016	Crit Rev Biotechnol	Submergence, whether partial or complete, imparts some serious consequences on plants grown in flood prone ecosystems. Some plants can endure these conditions by embracing various survival strategies, including morphological adaptations and physiological adjustments. This review summarizes recent progress made in understanding of the stress and the acclimation responses of plants under waterlogged or submerged conditions. Waterlogging and submergence are often associated with hypoxia development, which may trigger various morphological traits and cellular acclimation responses. Ethylene, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid and other hormones play a crucial role in the survival process which is controlled genetically. Effects at the cellular level, including ATP management, starch metabolism, elemental toxicity, role of transporters and redox status have been explained. Transcriptional and hormonal interplay during this stress may provide some key aspects in understanding waterlogging and submergence tolerance. The level and degree of tolerance may vary depending on species or climatic variations which need to be studied for a proper understanding of waterlogging stress at the global level. The exploration of regulatory pathways and interplay in model organisms such as Arabidopsis and rice would provide valuable resources for improvement of economically and agriculturally important plants in waterlogging affected areas.
26162429	RNA Interference Knockdown of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 in Maize Reveals Novel Functions for Brassinosteroid Signaling in Controlling Plant Architecture.	2015	Plant Physiol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones involved in various growth and developmental processes. The BR signaling system is well established in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) but poorly understood in maize (Zea mays). BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) is a BR receptor, and database searches and additional genomic sequencing identified five maize homologs including duplicate copies of BRI1 itself. RNA interference (RNAi) using the extracellular coding region of a maize zmbri1 complementary DNA knocked down the expression of all five homologs. Decreased response to exogenously applied brassinolide and altered BR marker gene expression demonstrate that zmbri1-RNAi transgenic lines have compromised BR signaling. zmbri1-RNAi plants showed dwarf stature due to shortened internodes, with upper internodes most strongly affected. Leaves of zmbri1-RNAi plants are dark green, upright, and twisted, with decreased auricle formation. Kinematic analysis showed that decreased cell division and cell elongation both contributed to the shortened leaves. A BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ETHYL METHANESULFONATE-SUPPRESSOR1-yellow fluorescent protein (BES1-YFP) transgenic line was developed that showed BR-inducible BES1-YFP accumulation in the nucleus, which was decreased in zmbri1-RNAi. Expression of the BES1-YFP reporter was strong in the auricle region of developing leaves, suggesting that localized BR signaling is involved in promoting auricle development, consistent with the zmbri1-RNAi phenotype. The blade-sheath boundary disruption, shorter ligule, and disrupted auricle morphology of RNAi lines resemble KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) mutants, consistent with a mechanistic connection between KNOX genes and BR signaling.
26224802	Constitutive Expression of Rice MicroRNA528 Alters Plant Development and Enhances Tolerance to Salinity Stress and Nitrogen Starvation in Creeping Bentgrass.	2015	Plant Physiol	MicroRNA528 (miR528) is a conserved monocot-specific small RNA that has the potential of mediating multiple stress responses. So far, however, experimental functional studies of miR528 are lacking. Here, we report that overexpression of a rice (Oryza sativa) miR528 (Osa-miR528) in transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) alters plant development and improves plant salt stress and nitrogen (N) deficiency tolerance. Morphologically, miR528-overexpressing transgenic plants display shortened internodes, increased tiller number, and upright growth. Improved salt stress resistance is associated with increased water retention, cell membrane integrity, chlorophyll content, capacity for maintaining potassium homeostasis, CATALASE activity, and reduced ASCORBIC ACID OXIDASE (AAO) activity; while enhanced tolerance to N deficiency is associated with increased biomass, total N accumulation and chlorophyll synthesis, nitrite reductase activity, and reduced AAO activity. In addition, AsAAO and COPPER ION BINDING PROTEIN1 are identified as two putative targets of miR528 in creeping bentgrass. Both of them respond to salinity and N starvation and are significantly down-regulated in miR528-overexpressing transgenics. Our data establish a key role that miR528 plays in modulating plant growth and development and in the plant response to salinity and N deficiency and indicate the potential of manipulating miR528 in improving plant abiotic stress resistance.
26134858	Identification of a member of the catalase multigene family on wheat chromosome 7A associated with flour b* colour and biological significance of allelic variation.	2015	Mol Genet Genomics	Carotenoids (especially lutein) are known to be the pigment source for flour b* colour in bread wheat. Flour b* colour variation is controlled by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on wheat chromosome 7AL and one gene from the carotenoid pathway, phytoene synthase, was functionally associated with the QTL on 7AL in some, but not all, wheat genotypes. A SNP marker within a sequence similar to catalase (Cat3-A1snp) derived from full-length (FL) cDNA (AK332460), however, was consistently associated with the QTL on 7AL and implicated in regulating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to control carotenoid accumulation affecting flour b* colour. The number of catalase genes on chromosome 7AL was investigated in this study to identify which gene may be implicated in flour b* variation and two were identified through interrogation of the draft wheat genome survey sequence consisting of five exons and a further two members having eight exons identified through comparative analysis with the single catalase gene on rice chromosome 6, PCR amplification and sequencing. It was evident that the catalase genes on chromosome 7A had duplicated and diverged during evolution relative to its counterpart on rice chromosome 6. The detection of transcripts in seeds, the co-location with Cat3-A1snp marker and maximised alignment of FL-cDNA (AK332460) with cognate genomic sequence indicated that TaCat3-A1 was the member of the catalase gene family associated with flour b* colour variation. Re-sequencing identified three alleles from three wheat varieties, TaCat3-A1a, TaCat3-A1b and TaCat3-A1c, and their predicted protein identified differences in peroxisomal targeting signal tri-peptide domain in the carboxyl terminal end providing new insights into their potential role in regulating cellular H2O2 that contribute to flour b* colour variation.
26198258	Mapping of a Cellulose-Deficient Mutant Named dwarf1-1 in Sorghum bicolor to the Green Revolution Gene gibberellin20-oxidase Reveals a Positive Regulatory Association between Gibberellin and Cellulose Biosynthesis.	2015	Plant Physiol	Here, we show a mechanism for expansion regulation through mutations in the green revolution gene gibberellin20 (GA20)-oxidase and show that GAs control biosynthesis of the plants main structural polymer cellulose. Within a 12,000 mutagenized Sorghum bicolor plant population, we identified a single cellulose-deficient and male gametophyte-dysfunctional mutant named dwarf1-1 (dwf1-1). Through the Sorghum propinquum male/dwf1-1 female F2 population, we mapped dwf1-1 to a frameshift in GA20-oxidase. Assessment of GAs in dwf1-1 revealed ablation of GA. GA ablation was antagonistic to the expression of three specific cellulose synthase genes resulting in cellulose deficiency and growth dwarfism, which were complemented by exogenous bioactive gibberellic acid application. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that GA was positively regulating the expression of a subset of specific cellulose synthase genes. To cross reference data from our mapped Sorghum sp. allele with another monocotyledonous plant, a series of rice (Oryza sativa) mutants involved in GA biosynthesis and signaling were isolated, and these too displayed cellulose deficit. Taken together, data support a model whereby suppressed expansion in green revolution GA genes involves regulation of cellulose biosynthesis.
26184504	Rice Xa21 primed genes and pathways that are critical for combating bacterial blight infection.	2015	Sci Rep	Rice bacterial blight (BB) is a devastating rice disease. The Xa21 gene confers a broad and persistent resistance against BB. We introduced Xa21 into Oryza sativa L ssp indica (rice 9311), through multi-generation backcrossing, and generated a nearly isogenic, blight-resistant 9311/Xa21 rice. Using next-generation sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of both varieties before and within four days after infection of bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The identified differentially expressed (DE) genes and signaling pathways revealed insights into the functions of Xa21. Surprisingly, before infection 1,889 genes on 135 of the 316 signaling pathways were DE between the 9311/Xa21 and 9311 plants. These Xa21-mediated basal pathways included mainly those related to the basic material and energy metabolisms and many related to phytohormones such as cytokinin, suggesting that Xa21 triggered redistribution of energy, phytohormones and resources among essential cellular activities before invasion. Counter-intuitively, after infection, the DE genes between the two plants were only one third of that before the infection; other than a few stress-related pathways, the affected pathways after infection constituted a small subset of the Xa21-mediated basal pathways. These results suggested that Xa21 primed critically important genes and signaling pathways, enhancing its resistance against bacterial infection.
26224365	SPX proteins regulate Pi homeostasis and signaling in different subcellular level.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	To cope with low phosphate (Pi) availability, plants have to adjust its gene expression profile to facilitate Pi acquisition and remobilization. Sensing the levels of Pi is essential for reprogramming the gene expression profile to adapt to the fluctuating Pi environment. AtPHR1 in Arabidopsis and OsPHR2 in rice are central regulators of Pi signaling, which regulates the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes by binding to the P1BS elements in the promoter of PSI genes. However, how the Pi level affects the central regulator to regulate the PSI genes have puzzled us for a decade. Recent progress in SPX proteins indicated that the SPX proteins play important role in regulating the activity of central regulator AtPHR1/OsPHR2 in a Pi dependent manner at different subcellular levels.
26165969	Haploids: Constraints and opportunities in plant breeding.	2015	Biotechnol Adv	The discovery of haploids in higher plants led to the use of doubled haploid (DH) technology in plant breeding. This article provides the state of the art on DH technology including the induction and identification of haploids, what factors influence haploid induction, molecular basis of microspore embryogenesis, the genetics underpinnings of haploid induction and its use in plant breeding, particularly to fix traits and unlock genetic variation. Both in vitro and in vivo methods have been used to induce haploids that are thereafter chromosome doubled to produce DH. Various heritable factors contribute to the successful induction of haploids, whose genetics is that of a quantitative trait. Genomic regions associated with in vitro and in vivo DH production were noted in various crops with the aid of DNA markers. It seems that F2 plants are the most suitable for the induction of DH lines than F1 plants. Identifying putative haploids is a key issue in haploid breeding. DH technology in Brassicas and cereals, such as barley, maize, rice, rye and wheat, has been improved and used routinely in cultivar development, while in other food staples such as pulses and root crops the technology has not reached to the stage leading to its application in plant breeding. The centromere-mediated haploid induction system has been used in Arabidopsis, but not yet in crops. Most food staples are derived from genomic resources-rich crops, including those with sequenced reference genomes. The integration of genomic resources with DH technology provides new opportunities for the improving selection methods, maximizing selection gains and accelerate cultivar development. Marker-aided breeding and DH technology have been used to improve host plant resistance in barley, rice, and wheat. Multinational seed companies are using DH technology in large-scale production of inbred lines for further development of hybrid cultivars, particularly in maize. The public sector provides support to national programs or small-medium private seed for the exploitation of DH technology in plant breeding.
26187026	Marker development, saturation mapping, and high-resolution mapping of the Septoria nodorum blotch susceptibility gene Snn3-B1 in wheat.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by Parastagonospora nodorum, is a severe foliar and glume disease on durum and common wheat. Pathogen-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs) are the major determinants for SNB on leaves. One such NE is SnTox3, which evokes programmed cell death and leads to disease when recognized by the wheat Snn3-B1 gene. Here, we developed saturated genetic linkage maps of the Snn3-B1 region using two F2 populations derived from the SnTox3-sensitive line Sumai 3 crossed with different SnTox3-insensitive lines. Markers were identified and/or developed from various resources including previously mapped simple sequence repeats, bin-mapped expressed sequence tags, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and whole genome survey sequences. Subsequent high-resolution mapping of the Snn3-B1 locus in 5600 gametes delineated the gene to a 1.5 cM interval. Analysis of micro-colinearity of the Snn3-B1 region indicated that it was highly disrupted compared to rice and Brachypodium distachyon. The screening of a collection of durum and common wheat cultivars with tightly linked markers indicated they are not diagnostic for the presence of Snn3-B1, but can be useful for marker-assisted selection if the SnTox3 reactions of lines are first determined. Finally, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant population of Sumai 3 where the screening of 408 M2 families led to the identification of 17 SnTox3-insensitive mutants. These mutants along with the markers and high-resolution map developed in this research provide a strong foundation for the map-based cloning of Snn3-B1, which will broaden our understanding of the wheat-P. nodorum system and plant-necrotrophic pathogen interactions in general.
26184180	Over-Expression of Rice CBS Domain Containing Protein, OsCBSX3, Confers Rice Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae Inoculation.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain containing proteins (CDCPs) constitute a big family in plants and some members in this family have been implicated in a variety of biological processes, but the precise functions and the underlying mechanism of the majority of this family in plant immunity remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a CBS domain containing protein gene, OsCBSX3, is functionally characterized in rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). By quantitative real-time PCR, transcripts of OsCBSX3 are up-regulated significantly by inoculation of M. oryzae and the exogenously applied salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). OsCBSX3 is exclusively localized to the plasma membrane by transient expression of OsCBSX3 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) through approach of Agrobacterium infiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plants of homozygous T3 transgenic rice lines of over-expressing OsCBSX3 exhibit significant enhanced resistance to M. oryzae inoculation, manifested by decreased disease symptoms, and inhibition of pathogen growth detected in DNA. Consistently, the over-expression of OsCBSX3 enhances the transcript levels of immunity associated marker genes including PR1a, PR1b, PR5, AOS2, PAL, NH1, and OsWRKY13 in plants inoculated with M. oryzae. These results suggest that OsCBSX3 acts as a positive regulator in resistance of rice to M. oryzae regulated by SA and JA-mediated signaling pathways synergistically.
26202549	The Rice Floral Repressor Early flowering1 Affects Spikelet Fertility By Modulating Gibberellin Signaling.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Gibberellic acid (GA; or gibberellin) affects the development of floral organs, especially anthers and pollen, and perturbation of development of male floral organs can cause sterility. Many studies of GA signaling have concentrated on anther development, but the effect of GA on grain production remains to be examined.

RESULTS: Using a cross of 'Milyang23 (M23)', which has a functional allele of Early flowering1 (EL1), and 'H143', which has a nonfunctional el1 allele, we generated heterogeneous inbred family-near isogenic lines (HNILs) that are homozygous for EL1 [HNIL(M23)] or el1 [HNIL(H143)]. Here, we found that HNIL(H143) exhibited anther deformities and low pollen viability. The expression of GAMYB, a major activator of GA signaling, and its downstream genes CYP703A3 and KAR, mainly involved in pollen formation, increased abnormally during spikelet development; this activation of GA signaling may cause the sterility. To confirm the negative effect of the el1 mutation on spikelet fertility, we examined a line carrying a T-DNA insertion el1 mutant [hereafter ZH11(el1)] and its parental cultivar 'Zhonghua11 (ZH11)'. ZH11(el1) showed nearly identical defects in anther development and pollen viability as HNIL(H143), leading to decreased seed setting rate. However, the elite japonica cultivar Koshihikari, which has a nonfunctional el1 allele for early flowering in long days, produces fertile spikelets and normal grain yields, like other elite japonica cultivars. This indicates that as-yet-unknown regulator(s) that can overcome the male sterile phenotype of the el1 mutation must have been introduced into Koshihikari.

CONCLUSIONS: The el1 mutation contributes to early flowering in japonica rice under long days but fails to limit GA signaling, thus negatively affecting spikelet fertility, which results in a loss of grain yield. Thus, EL1 is essential for photoperiod sensitivity in flowering as well as spikelet fertility in grain production.
26169392	Fine mapping of S37, a locus responsible for pollen and embryo sac sterility in hybrids between Oryza sativa L. and O. glaberrima Steud.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Hybrid sterility locus S37 between Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa results in both pollen and embryo sac sterility. Interspecific crossing between African cultivated rice Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa cultivars is hindered by hybrid sterility. To dissect the mechanism of interspecific hybrid sterility, we developed a near-isogenic line (NIL)-S37 using Dianjingyou1 (DJY1) as the recipient parent and an African cultivated rice variety as the donor parent. Empty pollen and embryo sac sterility were observed in F1 hybrids between DJY1 and NIL-S37. Cytological analyses showed that pollen abortion in the F1 hybrids occurred at the late binucleate stage due to a failure of starch accumulation in pollen grains. In addition, partial abortion of the embryo sac in the F1 hybrid was observed during function megaspore developing into mature embryo sac. Molecular analysis revealed that the semi-sterility was largely caused by the abortion of male and female gametophytes carrying the S37 allele from DJY1. A population of 25,600 plants derived from the hybrid DJY1/NIL-S37 was developed to fine map S37. Based on the physical location of molecular markers, S37 locus was finally delimited to a region of 205 kb on the short arm of chromosome 1 in terms of reference sequences of cv. Nipponbare. Interestingly, an about 97-kb DNA segment was deleted in the NIL-S37 based on BAC clone information of O. glaberrima. Fifty-four open reading frames (ORF) were predicted in this 205-kb region of DJY1, whereas only 31 ORFs were in that of NIL-S37. These results are valuable for cloning of S37 gene and further breaking reproductive isolation between Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa cultivars, as well as marker-assisted transferring of the corresponding neutral allele in rice breeding programs.
26230730	Differential Proteomic Analysis Using iTRAQ Reveals Alterations in Hull Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Rice hull, the outer cover of the rice grain, determines grain shape and size. Changes in the rice hull proteome in different growth stages may reflect the underlying mechanisms involved in grain development. To better understand these changes, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitative (iTRAQ) MS/MS was used to detect statistically significant changes in the rice hull proteome in the booting, flowering, and milk-ripe growth stages. Differentially expressed proteins were analyzed to predict their potential functions during development. Gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways were used to evaluate the biological mechanisms involved in rice hull at the three growth stages. In total, 5,268 proteins were detected and characterized, of which 563 were differentially expressed across the development stages. The results showed that the flowering and milk-ripe stage proteomes were more similar to each other (r=0.61) than either was to the booting stage proteome. A GO enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins was used to predict their roles during rice hull development. The potential functions of 25 significantly differentially expressed proteins were used to evaluate their possible roles at various growth stages. Among these proteins, an unannotated protein (Q7X8A1) was found to be overexpressed especially in the flowering stage, while a putative uncharacterized protein (B8BF94) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Q9FPK6) were overexpressed only in the milk-ripe stage. Pathways regulated by differentially expressed proteins were also analyzed. Magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester [oxidative] cyclase (Q9SDJ2), and two magnesium-chelatase subunits, ChlD (Q6ATS0), and ChlI (Q53RM0), were associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis at different developmental stages. The expression of Q9SDJ2 in the flowering and milk-ripe stages was validated by qRT-PCR. The 25 candidate proteins may be pivotal markers for controlling rice hull development at various growth stages and chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway related proteins, especially magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester [oxidative] cyclase (Q9SDJ2), may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of rice hull development and chlorophyll associated regulation.
26217366	Comparative analysis of the phytocyanin gene family in 10 plant species: a focus on Zea mays.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Phytocyanins (PCs) are plant-specific blue copper proteins, which play essential roles in electron transport. While the origin and expansion of this gene family is not well-investigated in plants. Here, we investigated their evolution by undertaking a genome-wide identification and comparison in 10 plants: Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, tomato, soybean, grape, maize, Selaginella moellendorffii, Physcomitrella patens, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found an expansion process of this gene family in evolution. Except PCs in Arabidopsis and rice, which have described in previous researches, a structural analysis of PCs in other eight plants indicated that 292 PCs contained N-terminal secretion signals and 217 PCs were expected to have glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor signals. Moreover, 281 PCs had putative arabinogalactan glycomodules and might be AGPs. Chromosomal distribution and duplication patterns indicated that tandem and segmental duplication played dominant roles for the expansion of PC genes. In addition, gene organization and motif compositions are highly conserved in each clade. Furthermore, expression profiles of maize PC genes revealed diversity in various stages of development. Moreover, all nine detected maize PC genes (ZmUC10, ZmUC16, ZmUC19, ZmSC2, ZmUC21, ZmENODL10, ZmUC22, ZmENODL13, and ZmENODL15) were down-regulated under salt treatment, and five PCs (ZmUC19, ZmSC2, ZmENODL10, ZmUC22, and ZmENODL13) were down-regulated under drought treatment. ZmUC16 was strongly expressed after drought treatment. This study will provide a basis for future understanding the characterization of this family.
26147209	Phytoene Desaturase from Oryza sativa: Oligomeric Assembly, Membrane Association and Preliminary 3D-Analysis.	2015	PLoS One	Recombinant phytoene desaturase (PDS-His6) from rice was purified to near-homogeneity and shown to be enzymatically active in a biphasic, liposome-based assay system. The protein contains FAD as the sole protein-bound redox-cofactor. Benzoquinones, not replaceable by molecular oxygen, serve as a final electron acceptor defining PDS as a 15-cis-phytoene (donor):plastoquinone oxidoreductase. The herbicidal PDS-inhibitor norflurazon is capable of arresting the reaction by stabilizing the intermediary FAD(red), while an excess of the quinone acceptor relieves this blockage, indicating competition. The enzyme requires its homo-oligomeric association for activity. The sum of data collected through gel permeation chromatography, non-denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis, chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy techniques indicate that the high-order oligomers formed in solution are the basis for an active preparation. Of these, a tetramer consisting of dimers represents the active unit. This is corroborated by our preliminary X-ray structural analysis that also revealed similarities of the protein fold with the sequence-inhomologous bacterial phytoene desaturase CRTI and other oxidoreductases of the GR2-family of flavoproteins. This points to an evolutionary relatedness of CRTI and PDS yielding different carotene desaturation sequences based on homologous protein folds.
26039357	The Arabidopsis thaliana TCP transcription factors: A broadening horizon beyond development.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	The TCP family of transcription factors is named after the first 4 characterized members, namely TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (TB1) from maize (Zea mays), CYCLOIDEA (CYC) from snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), as well as PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN FACTOR1 (PCF1) and PCF2 from rice (Oryza sativa). Phylogenic analysis of this plant-specific protein family unveils a conserved bHLH-containing DNA-binding motif known as the TCP domain. In accordance with the structure of this shared domain, TCP proteins are grouped into class I (TCP-P) and class II (TCP-C), which are suggested to antagonistically modulate plant growth and development via competitively binding similar cis-regulatory modules called site II elements. Over the last decades, TCPs across the plant kingdom have been demonstrated to control a plethora of plant processes. Notably, TCPs also regulate plant development and defense responses via stimulating the biosynthetic pathways of bioactive metabolites, such as brassinosteroid (BR), jasmonic acid (JA) and flavonoids. Besides, mutagenesis analysis coupled with biochemical experiments identifies several crucial amino acids located within the TCP domain, which confer the redox sensitivity of class I TCPs and determine the distinct DNA-binding properties of TCPs. In this review, developmental functions of TCPs in various biological pathways are briefly described with an emphasis on their involvement in the synthesis of bioactive substances. Furthermore, novel biochemical aspects of TCPs with respect to redox regulation and DNA-binding preferences are elaborated. In addition, the unexpected participation of TCPs in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and defense against insects indicates that the widely recognized developmental regulators are capable of fine-tuning defense signaling and thereby enable plants to evade deleterious developmental phenotypes. Altogether, these recent impressive breakthroughs remarkably advance our understanding as to how TCPs integrate internal developmental cues with external environmental stimuli to orchestrate plant development.
26183036	Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes. The unique features of Pi50 should facilitate its use in rice breeding and improve our understanding of the evolution of resistance specificities. Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, poses constant, major threats to stable rice production worldwide. The deployment of broad-spectrum resistance (R) genes provides the most effective and economical means for disease control. In this study, we characterize the broad-spectrum R gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus, which is embedded within a tandem cluster of 12 genes encoding proteins with nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains. In contrast with other Pi2/9 locus, the Pi50 cluster contains four duplicated genes (Pi50_NBS4_1 to 4) with extremely high nucleotide sequence similarity. Moreover, these duplicated genes encode two kinds of proteins (Pi50_NBS4_1/2 and Pi50_NBS4_3/4) that differ by four amino acids. Complementation tests and resistance spectrum analyses revealed that Pi50_NBS4_1/2, not Pi50_NBS4_3/4, control the novel resistance specificity as observed in the Pi50 near isogenic line, NIL-e1. Pi50 shares greater than 96 % amino acid sequence identity with each of three other R proteins, i.e., Pi9, Piz-t, and Pi2, and has amino acid changes predominantly within the LRR region. The identification of Pi50 with its novel resistance specificity will facilitate the dissection of mechanisms behind the divergence and evolution of different resistance specificities at the Pi2/9 locus.
26284084	Proteomic analysis and candidate allergenic proteins in Populus deltoides CL. "2KEN8" mature pollen.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Proteomic analysis was used to generate a map of Populus deltoides CL. "2KEN8" mature pollen proteins. By applying 2-D electrophoresis, we resolved 403 protein spots from mature pollen. Using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time time-of-flight/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry method, we identified 178 distinct proteins from 218 protein spots expressed in mature pollen. Moreover, out of these, 28 proteins were identified as putative allergens. The expression patterns of these putative allergen genes indicate that several of these genes are highly expressed in pollen. In addition, the members of profilin allergen family were analyzed and their expression patterns were compared with their homologous genes in Arabidopsis and rice. Knowledge of these identified allergens has the potential to improve specific diagnosis and allergen immunotherapy treatment for patients with poplar pollen allergy.
26136263	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 for Rab5 proteins coordinated with GLUP6/GEF regulates the intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm.	2015	J Exp Bot	Rice glutelin polypeptides are initially synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane as a proglutelin, which are then transported to the protein storage vacuole (PSV) via the Golgi apparatus. Rab5 and its cognate activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) are essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the PSV. Results from previous studies showed that the double recessive type of glup4/rab5a and glup6/gef mutant accumulated much higher amounts of proglutelin than either parent line. The present study demonstrates that the double recessive type of glup4/rab5a and glup6/gef mutant showed not only elevated proglutelin levels and much larger paramural bodies but also reduced the number and size of PSVs, indicating a synergistic mutation effect. These observations led us to the hypothesis that other isoforms of Rab5 and GEF also participate in the intracellular transport of rice glutelin. A database search identified a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rab5-GEF2. Like GLUP6/GEF, Rab5-GEF2 was capable of activating Rab5a and two other Rab5 isoforms in in vitro GTP/GDP exchange assays. GEF proteins consist of the helical bundle (HB) domain at the N-terminus, Vps9 domain, and a C-terminal region. By the deletion analysis of GEFs, the HB domain was found essential for the activation of Rab5 proteins.
26162098	SS1 (NAL1)- and SS2-Mediated Genetic Networks Underlying Source-Sink and Yield Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Source leaf/sink capacity (SS) traits are important determinants of grain yield (GY) of rice. To understand the genetic basis of the SS relationship in rice, five SS and GY traits of rice were genetically dissected using two reciprocal introgression populations. Seventy-three QTL affecting the SS and GY traits were identified, most of which were detected in one of the parental genetic backgrounds (GBs). Two major QTL at bins 4.7 (SS1) and 3.12 (SS2) were associated consistently with all measured SS and yield traits in both GBs across two contrasting environments. Strong interactions between SS1/SS2 and the detected QTL led us to the discovery of genetic networks affecting the SS and GY traits. The SS1 acted as a regulator controlling two groups of downstream QTL affecting the source leaf width and grain number per panicle (GNP). SS2 functioned as a regulator positively regulating different groups of downstream QTL affecting the source leaf length, GNP, grain weight, and GY. Map-based cloning of SS1 indicates that SS1 is NAL1 involved in polar auxin/IAA transport. Different alleles at NAL1 were apparently able to qualitatively and/or quantitatively control the IAA transport from the apical meristem to different plant tissues and thus regulate those downstream loci/pathways controlling different SS traits of rice. There was a functional allele and a non-functional mutation in the parents at each of the QTL downstream of SS1 or SS2, which were detectable only in the presence of the functional allele of SS1 or SS2. Our results provided direct evidence that SS and yield traits in rice are controlled by complex signaling pathways and suggest further improvement of rice yield potential with enhanced and balanced SS relationships can be achieved by accurately manipulating allelic combinations at loci in the SS1 and SS2 mediated pathways.
26138548	Enhanced leaf photosynthesis as a target to increase grain yield: insights from transgenic rice lines with variable Rieske FeS protein content in the cytochrome b6 /f complex.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Although photosynthesis is the most important source for biomass and grain yield, a lack of correlation between photosynthesis and plant yield among different genotypes of various crop species has been frequently observed. Such observations contribute to the ongoing debate whether enhancing leaf photosynthesis can improve yield potential. Here, transgenic rice plants that contain variable amounts of the Rieske FeS protein in the cytochrome (cyt) b6 /f complex between 10 and 100% of wild-type levels have been used to investigate the effect of reductions of these proteins on photosynthesis, plant growth and yield. Reductions of the cyt b6 /f complex did not affect the electron transport rates through photosystem I but decreased electron transport rates through photosystem II, leading to concomitant decreases in CO2 assimilation rates. There was a strong control of plant growth and grain yield by the rate of leaf photosynthesis, leading to the conclusion that enhancing photosynthesis at the single-leaf level would be a useful target for improving crop productivity and yield both via conventional breeding and biotechnology. The data here also suggest that changing photosynthetic electron transport rates via manipulation of the cyt b6 /f complex could be a potential target for enhancing photosynthetic capacity in higher plants.
26228872	An indica rice genotype showed a similar yield enhancement to that of hybrid rice under free air carbon dioxide enrichment.	2015	Sci Rep	Although the rice growth response to FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) has been widely studied and is considered important within the scientific community, few studies have attempted to examine the effects of FACE on the yield of indica rice, which is typically the parent of indica hybrids in China. The effects of FACE on the yield, yield components, biomass, N uptake and leaf photosynthesis of Yangdao 6 Hao (an indica rice) in China were examined over 2 years. The grain yield increased over 30%, the panicle number increased 12.4% on average, and the spikelet number per panicle also showed an average increase of 8.2% at elevated CO2. FACE caused a significant enhancement in both the filled spikelet percentage (+5.9%) and the individual grain weight (+3.0%). Compared with three prior FACE studies on rice, a similar enhancement of yield in hybrid indica was shown under FACE, with much a higher value than for the japonica rice cultivar (approximately + 13%) because of indica's stronger sink generation and N uptake capacity, which help coordinate the C/N balance to avoid photosynthetic acclimation. The high enhancement of the indica rice yield under FACE holds promise for improved cultivar selection for future food security.
26194356	RiTE database: a resource database for genus-wide rice genomics and evolutionary biology.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Comparative evolutionary analysis of whole genomes requires not only accurate annotation of gene space, but also proper annotation of the repetitive fraction which is often the largest component of most if not all genomes larger than 50 kb in size.

RESULTS: Here we present the Rice TE database (RiTE-db)--a genus-wide collection of transposable elements and repeated sequences across 11 diploid species of the genus Oryza and the closely-related out-group Leersia perrieri. The database consists of more than 170,000 entries divided into three main types: (i) a classified and curated set of publicly-available repeated sequences, (ii) a set of consensus assemblies of highly-repetitive sequences obtained from genome sequencing surveys of 12 species; and (iii) a set of full-length TEs, identified and extracted from 12 whole genome assemblies.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a repeat dataset that spans the majority of repeat variability within an entire genus, and one that includes complete elements as well as unassembled repeats. The database allows sequence browsing, downloading, and similarity searches. Because of the strategy adopted, the RiTE-db opens a new path to unprecedented direct comparative studies that span the entire nuclear repeat content of 15 million years of Oryza diversity.
26226878	Root aquaporins contribute to whole plant water fluxes under drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Aquaporin activity and root anatomy may affect root hydraulic properties under drought stress. To better understand the function of aquaporins in rice root water fluxes under drought, we studied the root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and root sap exudation rate (Sr) in the presence or absence of an aquaporin inhibitor (azide) under well-watered conditions and following drought stress in six diverse rice varieties. Varieties varied in Lpr and Sr under both conditions. The contribution of aquaporins to Lpr was generally high (up to 79% under well-watered conditions and 85% under drought stress) and differentially regulated under drought. Aquaporin contribution to Sr increased in most varieties after drought, suggesting a crucial role for aquaporins in osmotic water fluxes during drought and recovery. Furthermore, root plasma membrane aquaporin (PIP) expression and root anatomical properties were correlated with hydraulic traits. Three chromosome regions highly correlated with hydraulic traits of the OryzaSNP panel were identified, but did not co-locate with known aquaporins. These results therefore highlight the importance of aquaporins in the rice root radial water pathway, but emphasize the complex range of additional mechanisms related to root water fluxes and drought response.
26040787	CARMO: a comprehensive annotation platform for functional exploration of rice multi-omics data.	2015	Plant J	High-throughput technology is gradually becoming a powerful tool for routine research in rice. Interpretation of biological significance from the huge amount of data is a critical but non-trivial task, especially for rice, for which gene annotations rely heavily on sequence similarity rather than direct experimental evidence. Here we describe the annotation platform for comprehensive annotation of rice multi-omics data (CARMO), which provides multiple web-based analysis tools for in-depth data mining and visualization. The central idea involves systematic integration of 1819 samples from omics studies and diverse sources of functional evidence (15 401 terms), which are further organized into gene sets and higher-level gene modules. In this way, the high-throughput data may easily be compared across studies and platforms, and integration of multiple types of evidence allows biological interpretation from the level of gene functional modules with high confidence. In addition, the functions and pathways for thousands of genes lacking description or validation may be deduced based on concerted expression of genes within the constructed co-expression networks or gene modules. Overall, CARMO provides comprehensive annotations for transcriptomic datasets, epi-genomic modification sites, single nucleotide polymorphisms identified from genome re-sequencing, and the large gene lists derived from these omics studies. Well-organized results, as well as multiple tools for interactive visualization, are available through a user-friendly web interface. Finally, we illustrate how CARMO enables biological insights using four examples, demonstrating that CARMO is a highly useful resource for intensive data mining and hypothesis generation based on rice multi-omics data. CARMO is freely available online (http://bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/carmo).
26218318	Where steroids meet the cell cycle in architecture.	2015	Dev Cell	Understanding how plant architecture is controlled is not only important from a developmental point of view, but it also has direct consequence for agriculture. Reporting in this issue of Developmental Cell, Sun et al. (2015) unravel a cascade from Brassinosteroids to a poorly understood U-type cyclin in rice leaf erectness.
26208642	High night temperature strongly impacts TCA cycle, amino acid and polyamine biosynthetic pathways in rice in a sensitivity-dependent manner.	2015	J Exp Bot	Global climate change combined with asymmetric warming can have detrimental effects on the yield of crop plants such as rice (Oryza sativa L.). Little is known about metabolic responses of rice to high night temperature (HNT) conditions. Twelve cultivars with different HNT sensitivity were used to investigate metabolic changes in the vegetative stage under HNT compared to control conditions. Central metabolism, especially TCA cycle and amino acid biosynthesis, were strongly affected particularly in sensitive cultivars. Levels of several metabolites were correlated with HNT sensitivity. Furthermore, pool sizes of some metabolites negatively correlated with HNT sensitivity under control conditions, indicating metabolic pre-adaptation in tolerant cultivars. The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine showed increased abundance in sensitive cultivars under HNT conditions. Correlations between the content of polyamines and 75 other metabolites indicated metabolic shifts from correlations with sugar-phosphates and 1-kestose under control to correlations with sugars and amino and organic acids under HNT conditions. Increased expression levels of ADC2 and ODC1, genes encoding enzymes catalysing the first committed steps of putrescine biosynthesis, were restricted to sensitive cultivars under HNT. Additionally, transcript levels of eight polyamine biosynthesis genes were correlated with HNT sensitivity. Responses to HNT in the vegetative stage result in distinct differences between differently responding cultivars with a dysregulation of central metabolism and an increase of polyamine biosynthesis restricted to sensitive cultivars under HNT conditions and a pre-adaptation of tolerant cultivars already under control conditions with higher levels of potentially protective compatible solutes.
26284087	Functional properties and structural characterization of rice δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The majority of plant species accumulate high intracellular levels of proline to cope with hyperosmotic stress conditions. Proline synthesis from glutamate is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and the translational levels, yet little is known about the mechanisms for post-translational regulation of the enzymatic activities involved. The gene coding in rice (Oryza sativa L.) for δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the second and final step in this pathway, was isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli. The structural and functional properties of the affinity-purified protein were characterized. As for most species, rice P5C reductase was able to use in vitro either NADH or NADPH as the electron donor. However, strikingly different effects of cations and anions were found depending on the pyridine nucleotide used, namely inhibition of NADH-dependent activity and stimulation of NADPH-dependent activity. Moreover, physiological concentrations of proline and NADP(+) were strongly inhibitory for the NADH-dependent reaction, whereas the NADPH-dependent activity was mildly affected. Our results suggest that only NADPH may be used in vivo and that stress-dependent variations in ion homeostasis and NADPH/NADP(+) ratio could modulate enzyme activity, being functional in promoting proline accumulation and potentially also adjusting NADPH consumption during the defense against hyperosmotic stress. The apparent molecular weight of the native protein observed in size exclusion chromatography indicated a high oligomerization state. We also report the first crystal structure of a plant P5C reductase at 3.40-Å resolution, showing a decameric quaternary assembly. Based on the structure, it was possible to identify dynamic structural differences among rice, human, and bacterial enzymes.
26206756	Mapping Consistent Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Yield QTLs under Drought Stress in Target Rainfed Environments.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Drought stress is a major limitation to rainfed rice production and yield stability. Identifying yield-associated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are consistent under drought stress predominant in target production environments, as well as across different genetic backgrounds, will help to develop high-yielding rice cultivars suitable for water-limited environments through marker-assisted breeding (MAB). Considerable progress has been made in mapping QTLs for drought resistance traits in rice; however, few have been successfully used in MAB.

RESULTS: Recombinant inbred lines of IR20 × Nootripathu, two indica cultivars adapted to rainfed target populations of environments (TPEs), were evaluated in one and two seasons under managed stress and in a rainfed target drought stress environment, respectively. In the managed stress environment, the severity of the stress meant that measurements could be made only on secondary traits and biomass. In the target environment, the lines experienced varying timings, durations, and intensities of drought stress. The rice recombinant inbred lines exhibited significant genotypic variation for physio-morphological, phenological, and plant production traits under drought. Nine and 24 QTLs for physio-morphological and plant production traits were identified in managed and natural drought stress conditions in the TPEs, respectively. Yield QTLs that were consistent in the target environment over seasons were identified on chromosomes 1, 4, and 6, which could stabilize the productivity in high-yielding rice lines in a water-limited rainfed ecosystem. These yield QTLs also govern highly heritable key secondary traits, such as leaf drying, canopy temperature, panicle harvest index and harvest index.

CONCLUSION: Three QTL regions on chromosome 1 (RM8085), chromosome 4 (I12S), and chromosome 6 (RM6836) harbor significant additive QTLs for various physiological and yield traits under drought stress. The similar chromosomal region on 4 and 6 were found to harbor QTLs for canopy temperature and leaf drying under drought stress conditions. Thus, the identified large effect yield QTLs could be introgressed to develop rice lines with stable yields under varying natural drought stress predominant in TPEs.
26214462	Comprehensive identification and expression analysis of Hsp90s gene family in Solanum lycopersicum.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a protein produced by plants in response to adverse environmental stresses. In this study, we identified and analyzed Hsp90 gene family members using a bioinformatic method based on genomic data from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The results illustrated that tomato contains at least 7 Hsp90 genes distributed on 6 chromosomes; protein lengths ranged from 267-794 amino acids. Intron numbers ranged from 2-19 in the genes. The phylogenetic tree revealed that Hsp90 genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) could be divided into 5 groups, which included 3 pairs of orthologous genes and 4 pairs of paralogous genes. Expression analysis of RNA-sequence data showed that the Hsp90-1 gene was specifically expressed in mature fruits, while Hsp90-5 and Hsp90-6 showed opposite expression patterns in various tissues of cultivated and wild tomatoes. The expression levels of the Hsp90-1, Hsp90-2, and Hsp90- 3 genes in various tissues of cultivated tomatoes were high, while both the expression levels of genes Hsp90-3 and Hsp90-4 were low. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that these genes were involved in the responses to yellow leaf curl virus in tomato plant leaves. Our results provide a foundation for identifying the function of the Hsp90 gene in tomato.
26143253	Genome-Wide Nucleosome Occupancy and Positioning and Their Impact on Gene Expression and Evolution in Plants.	2015	Plant Physiol	The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome that consists of a protein octamer composed of the four core histones (Hs; H3, H4, H2A, and H2B) wrapped by 147 bp of DNA. Nucleosome occupancy and positioning have proven to be dynamic and have a critical impact on expression, regulation, and evolution of eukaryotic genes. We developed nucleosome occupancy and positioning data sets using leaf tissue of rice (Oryza sativa) and both leaf and flower tissues of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that model plant and animal species share the fundamental characteristics associated with nucleosome dynamics. Only 12% and 16% of the Arabidopsis and rice genomes, respectively, were occupied by well-positioned nucleosomes. The cores of positioned nucleosomes were enriched with G/C dinucleotides and showed a lower C→T mutation rate than the linker sequences. We discovered that nucleosomes associated with heterochromatic regions were more spaced with longer linkers than those in euchromatic regions in both plant species. Surprisingly, different nucleosome densities were found to be associated with chromatin in leaf and flower tissues in Arabidopsis. We show that deep MNase-seq data sets can be used to map nucleosome occupancy of specific genomic loci and reveal gene expression patterns correlated with chromatin dynamics in plant genomes.
26145151	Global Analysis Reveals the Crucial Roles of DNA Methylation during Rice Seed Development.	2015	Plant Physiol	Seed development is an important process of reproductive development and consists of embryo and endosperm development; both comprise several key processes. To determine and investigate the functions of the dynamic DNA methylome during seed development, we profiled the DNA methylation genome wide in a series of developmental stages of rice (Oryza sativa) embryo and endosperm by methylcytosine immunoprecipitation followed by Illumina sequencing. The results showed that embryo is hypermethylated predominantly around non-transposable element (TE) genes, short DNA-TEs, and short interspersed TEs compared with endosperm, and non-TE genes have the most diverse methylation status across seed development. In addition, lowly expressed genes are significantly enriched in hypermethylated genes, but not vice versa, confirming the crucial role of DNA methylation in suppressing gene transcription. Further analysis revealed the significantly decreased methylation at early developing stages (from 2 to 3 d after pollination), indicating a predominant role of demethylation during early endosperm development and that genes with a consistent negative correlation between DNA methylation change and expression change may be potentially directly regulated by DNA methylation. Interestingly, comparative analysis of the DNA methylation profiles revealed that both rice indica and japonica subspecies showed robust fluctuant profiles of DNA methylation levels in embryo and endosperm across seed development, with the highest methylation level at 6 d after pollination (2 d after pollination of endosperm in japonica as well), indicating that a complex and finely controlled methylation pattern is closely associated with seed development regulation. The systemic characterization of the dynamic DNA methylome in developing rice seeds will help us understand the effects and mechanism of epigenetic regulation in seed development.
26025517	Dwarf and tiller-enhancing 1 regulates growth and development by influencing boron uptake in boron limited conditions in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Boron (B) is essential for plant growth, and B deficiency causes severe losses in crop yield. Here we isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant named dwarf and tiller-enhancing 1 (dte1), which exhibits defects under low-B conditions, including retarded growth, increased number of tillers and impaired pollen fertility. Map-based cloning revealed that dte1 encodes a NOD26-LIKE INTRINSIC PROTEIN orthologous to known B channel proteins AtNIP5;1 in Arabidopsis and TASSEL-LESS1 in maize. Its identity was verified by transgenic complementation and RNA-interference. Subcellular localization showed DTE1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane. The accumulation of DTE1 transcripts both in roots and shoots significantly increased within 3h of the onset of B starvation, but decreased within 1h of B replenishment. GUS staining indicated that DTE1s are expressed abundantly in exodermal cells in roots, as well as in nodal region of adult leaves. Although the dte1 mutation apparently reduces the total B content in plants, it does not affect in vivo B concentrations under B-deficient conditions. These data provide evidence that DTE1 is critical for vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice grown under B-deficient conditions.
26190148	Brassinosteroid signaling regulates leaf erectness in Oryza sativa via the control of a specific U-type cyclin and cell proliferation.	2015	Dev Cell	Leaf erectness is key in determining plant architecture and yield, particularly in cereal crops. Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a unique role in controlling this trait in monocots, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain big mysteries. Here we report that the abaxial sclerenchyma cell number of rice lamina joints (LJs) is closely related to leaf erectness, and BR signaling tightly regulates their proliferation. We identified a rice U-type cyclin CYC U4;1 enriched in rice LJs, with its expression accompanying LJ development. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell proliferation. Furthermore, BR signaling inhibits the abaxial sclerenchyma cell division by coordinately regulating CYC U4;1 expression through BES1 and CYC U4;1 protein activity through GSK3 kinases. These results support a key role of the cyclin CYC U4;1 in mediating BR-regulated cell division to control leaf erectness.
26149854	Rice_Phospho 1.0: a new rice-specific SVM predictor for protein phosphorylation sites.	2015	Sci Rep	Experimentally-determined or computationally-predicted protein phosphorylation sites for distinctive species are becoming increasingly common. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of a novel classification algorithm with different encoding schemes to develop a rice-specific protein phosphorylation site predictor. Our results imply that the combination of Amino acid occurrence Frequency with Composition of K-Spaced Amino Acid Pairs (AF-CKSAAP) provides the best description of relevant sequence features that surround a phosphorylation site. A support vector machine (SVM) using AF-CKSAAP achieves the best performance in classifying rice protein phophorylation sites when compared to the other algorithms. We have used SVM with AF-CKSAAP to construct a rice-specific protein phosphorylation sites predictor, Rice_Phospho 1.0 (http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/rice_phospho1.0). We measure the Accuracy (ACC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of Rice_Phospho 1.0 to be 82.0% and 0.64, significantly higher than those measures for other predictors such as Scansite, Musite, PlantPhos and PhosphoRice. Rice_Phospho 1.0 also successfully predicted the experimentally identified phosphorylation sites in LOC_Os03g51600.1, a protein sequence which did not appear in the training dataset. In summary, Rice_phospho 1.0 outputs reliable predictions of protein phosphorylation sites in rice, and will serve as a useful tool to the community.
26233709	Role of phytosterols in drought stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Phytosterols are integral components of the membrane lipid bilayer in plants. They regulate membrane fluidity to influence its properties, functions and structure. An increase in accumulation of phytosterols namely campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol was observed in rice as seedlings matured. The levels of the major phytosterol, β-sitosterol in N22 (drought tolerant) rice seedlings was found to increase proportionately with severity of drought stress. Its levels were 145, 216, 345 and 364 μg/g FW after subjecting to water stress for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days respectively, while for IR64 (drought susceptible), levels were 137, 198, 227 and 287 μg/g FW at the same stages. Phytosterols were also found to increase with maturity as observed at 30, 50 and 75 days after planting. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) which is considered to be a key limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of phytosterols was 0.55, 0.56, 0.78 and 0.85 μmol/min/L at 3, 6, 9 and 12 days of water stress in N22 and 0.31, 0.50, 0.54 and 0.65 μmol/min/L in case of IR64 respectively. The elevation in the levels of phytosterols as well as the activity of HMG-CoA reductase during drought stress indicates the role of phytosterols in providing tolerance to stress.
26095647	PAY1 improves plant architecture and enhances grain yield in rice.	2015	Plant J	Plant architecture, a complex of the important agronomic traits that determine grain yield, is a primary target of artificial selection of rice domestication and improvement. Some important genes affecting plant architecture and grain yield have been isolated and characterized in recent decades; however, their underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we report genetic identification and functional analysis of the PLANT ARCHITECTURE AND YIELD 1 (PAY1) gene in rice, which affects plant architecture and grain yield in rice. Transgenic plants over-expressing PAY1 had twice the number of grains per panicle and consequently produced nearly 38% more grain yield per plant than control plants. Mechanistically, PAY1 could improve plant architecture via affecting polar auxin transport activity and altering endogenous indole-3-acetic acid distribution. Furthermore, introgression of PAY1 into elite rice cultivars, using marker-assisted background selection, dramatically increased grain yield compared with the recipient parents. Overall, these results demonstrated that PAY1 could be a new beneficial genetic resource for shaping ideal plant architecture and breeding high-yielding rice varieties.
26196146	Stress induced gene expression drives transient DNA methylation changes at adjacent repetitive elements.	2015	Elife	Cytosine DNA methylation (mC) is a genome modification that can regulate the expression of coding and non-coding genetic elements. However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly DCL3a-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in Arabidopsis revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress.
26133732	Genetic dissection on rice grain shape by the two-dimensional image analysis in one japonica × indica population consisting of recombinant inbred lines.	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: This article used seven characters from the 2D image analysis to dissect the genetic architecture underlying rice grain shape in one japonica × indica population consisting of 215 recombinant inbred lines. Two-dimensional (2D) digital image analysis is efficient for investigating the rice grain shape characters in large genetic and breeding populations. In this study, we used 2D image analysis to investigate seven characters, i.e., grain length (GL), grain width (GW), length-to-width ratio (LW), grain area (GA), grain circumference (GC), grain diameter (GD), and grain roundness (GR), in one japonica × indica genetic population consisting of 215 recombinant inbred lines. GL and GW can be recorded manually as well, and have been extensively used together with LW (i.e., GL/GW) in genetic studies on grain shape. GC and GA can be hardly measured manually, and have not been used together with GD and GR. Results indicated that the seven characters could be precisely measured by 2D image analysis, genotype by environment interaction was low, and heritability was high. Each character was controlled by a few major stable genes and multiple minor additive genes. A total of 51 QTL were detected for the seven characters across four diverse environments, 22 from GL, GW, and LW, the three traditional characters, and 29 from the other four characters. The 51 QTL were clustered in eighteen marker intervals. Comparing with previous studies and analyzing the stability of identified QTL, we found six non-reported marker intervals, one each on chromosomes 2 and 3, and two each on chromosomes 6 and 8. The newly identified loci and the large-scale phenotyping system would greatly improve our knowledge about the genetic architecture and the future rice breeding on grain shape.
26206757	Coexpression Network Analysis of Macronutrient Deficiency Response Genes in Rice.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Macronutrients are pivotal elements for proper plant growth and development. Although extensive gene expression profiling revealed a large number of genes differentially expressed under various nutrient deprivation, characterization of these genes has never been fully explored especially in rice. Coexpression network analysis is a useful tool to elucidate the functional relationships of genes based on common expression. Therefore, we performed microarray analysis of rice shoot under nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) deficiency conditions. Moreover, we conducted a large scale coexpression analysis by integrating the data with previously generated gene expression profiles of organs and tissues at different developmental stages to obtain a global view of gene networks associated with plant response to nutrient deficiency.

RESULTS: We statistically identified 5400 differentially expressed genes under the nutrient deficiency treatments. Subsequent coexpression analysis resulted in the extraction of 6 modules (groups of highly interconnected genes) with distinct gene expression signatures. Three of these modules comprise mostly of downregulated genes under N deficiency associated with distinct functions such as development of immature organs, protein biosynthesis and photosynthesis in chloroplast of green tissues, and fundamental cellular processes in all organs and tissues. Furthermore, we identified one module containing upregulated genes under N and K deficiency conditions, and a number of genes encoding protein kinase, kinase-like domain containing protein and nutrient transporters. This module might be particularly involved in adaptation to nutrient deficiency via phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction and/or post-transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that large scale coexpression analysis is an efficient approach in characterizing the nutrient response genes based on biological functions and could provide new insights in understanding plant response to nutrient deficiency.
26198760	Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of QTLs for resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf disease in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Rice black-streaked dwarf disease, caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), is transmitted by small brown planthoppers (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, SBPH) and causes severe yield loss in epidemic years in China and other East Asian countries. Breeding for resistance to RBSDV is a promising strategy to control the disease. We identified Tetep that showed resistance to RBSDV using a field test and artificial inoculation test. An evaluation of the resistance mechanism revealed that Tetep was resistant to RBSDV but not to SBPH. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance of Tetep to RBSDV was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three new QTLs for RBSDV resistance were identified in this study, i.e., qRBSDV-3, qRBSDV-10 and qRBSDV-11. The LOD scores of qRBSDV-3, qRBSDV-10 and qRBSDV-11 were 4.07, 2.24 and 2.21, accounting for 17.5%, 0.3% and 12.4% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. All the resistance loci identified in this study were associated with virus resistance genes. The alleles for enhancing resistance on chromosomes 3 and 11 originated from Tetep, whereas the other allele on chromosome 10 originated from a susceptible parent. The identified new resistance QTLs in this study are useful resources for efficiently breeding resistant rice cultivars to RBSDV.
26139575	Thymidine kinases share a conserved function for nucleotide salvage and play an essential role in Arabidopsis thaliana growth and development.	2015	New Phytol	Thymidine kinases (TKs) are important components in the nucleotide salvage pathway. However, knowledge about plant TKs is quite limited. In this study, the molecular function of TKs in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. Two TKs were identified and named AtTK1 and AtTK2. Expression of both genes was ubiquitous, but AtTK1 was strongly expressed in high-proliferation tissues. AtTK1 was localized to the cytosol, whereas AtTK2 was localized to the mitochondria. Mutant analysis indicated that the two genes function coordinately to sustain normal plant development. Enzymatic assays showed that the two TK proteins shared similar catalytic specificity for pyrimidine nucleosides. They were able to complement an Escherichia coli strain lacking TK activity. 5'-Fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU) resistance and 5-ethynyl 2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays confirmed their activity in vivo. Furthermore, the tk mutant phenotype could be alleviated by nucleotide feeding, establishing that the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides was disrupted by the TK deficiency. Finally, both human and rice (Oryza sativa) TKs were able to rescue the tk mutants, demonstrating the functional conservation of TKs across organisms. Taken together, our findings clarify the specialized function of two TKs in A. thaliana and establish that the salvage pathway mediated by the kinases is essential for plant growth and development.
26121931	ClpB/Hsp100 proteins and heat stress tolerance in plants.	2016	Crit Rev Biotechnol	High-temperature stress can disrupt cellular proteostasis, resulting in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. For survival under stressful conditions, it is important for cells to maintain a pool of native soluble proteins by preventing and/or dissociating these aggregates. Chaperones such as GroEL/GroES (Hsp60/Hsp10) and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (Hsp70/Hsp40/nucleotide exchange factor) help cells minimize protein aggregation. Protein disaggregation is accomplished by chaperones belonging to the Caseinolytic Protease (Clp) family of proteins. ClpB/Hsp100 proteins are strikingly ubiquitous and are found in bacteria, yeast and multi-cellular plants. The expression of these proteins is regulated by heat stress (HS) and developmental cues. Bacteria and yeast contain one and two forms of ClpB proteins, respectively. Plants possess multiple forms of these proteins that are localized to different cellular compartments (i.e. cytoplasm/nucleus, chloroplast or mitochondria). Overwhelming evidence suggests that ClpB/Hsp100 proteins play decisive roles in cell adaptation to HS. Mutant bacteria and yeast cells lacking active ClpB/Hsp100 proteins are critically sensitive to high-temperature stress. Likewise, Arabidopsis, maize and rice mutants lacking cytoplasmic ClpB proteins are very sensitive to heat. In this study, we present the structural and functional attributes of plant ClpB forms.
26152574	Loci, genes, and mechanisms associated with tolerance to ferrous iron toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A genome-wide association study in rice yielded loci and candidate genes associated with tolerance to iron toxicity, and revealed biochemical mechanisms associated with tolerance in contrasting haplotypes. Iron toxicity is a major nutrient disorder affecting rice. Therefore, understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms associated with iron toxicity tolerance is crucial in adaptive breeding and biofortification. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by exposing a population of 329 accessions representing all subgroups of rice to ferrous iron stress (1000 ppm, 5 days). Expression patterns and sequence polymorphisms of candidate genes were investigated, and physiological hypotheses related to candidate loci were tested using a subset of contrasting haplotypes. Both iron including and excluding tolerant genotypes were observed, and shoot iron concentrations explained around 15.5 % of the variation in foliar symptom formation. GWAS for seven traits yielded 20 SNP markers exceeding a significance threshold of -log10 P > 4.0, which represented 18 distinct loci. One locus mapped for foliar symptom formation on chromosome 1 contained two putative glutathione-S-transferases, which were strongly expressed under iron stress and showed sequence polymorphisms in complete linkage disequilibrium with the most significant SNP. Contrasting haplotypes for this locus showed significant differences in dehydroascorbate reductase activity, which affected the plants' redox status under iron stress. We conclude that maintaining foliar redox homeostasis under iron stress represented an important tolerance mechanism associated with a locus identified through GWAS.
26303982	Differential responses of Oryza sativa secondary metabolism to biotic interactions with cooperative, commensal and phytopathogenic bacteria.	2015	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Profiling of plant secondary metabolite allows to differentiate the different types of ecological interactions established between rice and bacteria. Rice responds to ecologically distinct bacteria by altering its content of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Plants' growth and physiology are strongly influenced by the biotic interactions that plants establish with soil bacterial populations. Plants are able to sense and to respond accordingly to ecologically distinct bacteria, by inducing defense pathways against pathogens to prevent parasitic interactions, and by stimulating the growth of root-associated beneficial or commensal bacteria through root exudation. Plant secondary metabolism is expected to play a major role in this control. However, secondary metabolite responses of a same plant to cooperative, commensal and deleterious bacteria have so far never been compared. The impact of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) Azospirillum lipoferum 4B on the secondary metabolite profiles of two Oryza sativa L. cultivars (Cigalon and Nipponbare) was compared to that of a rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae AU6208, the causing agent of bacterial panicle blight and of a commensal environmental bacteria Escherichia coli B6. Root and shoot rice extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Principal component analyses (PCAs) pinpointed discriminant secondary metabolites, which were characterized by mass spectrometry. Direct comparison of metabolic profiles evidenced that each bacterial ecological interaction induced distinct qualitative and quantitative modifications of rice secondary metabolism, by altering the content of numerous flavonoid compounds and hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives. Secondary metabolism varied according to the cultivars and the interaction types, demonstrating the relevance of secondary metabolic profiling for studying plant-bacteria biotic interactions.
26243616	Rice TUTOU1 Encodes a Suppressor of cAMP Receptor-Like Protein That Is Important for Actin Organization and Panicle Development.	2015	Plant Physiol	Panicle development, a key event in rice (Oryza sativa) reproduction and a critical determinant of grain yield, forms a branched structure containing multiple spikelets. Genetic and environmental factors can perturb panicle development, causing panicles to degenerate and producing characteristic whitish, small spikelets with severely reduced fertility and yield; however, little is known about the molecular basis of the formation of degenerating panicles in rice. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the rice panicle degenerative mutant tutou1 (tut1), which shows severe defects in panicle development. The tut1 also shows a pleiotropic phenotype, characterized by short roots, reduced plant height, and abnormal development of anthers and pollen grains. Molecular genetic studies revealed that TUT1 encodes a suppressor of cAMP receptor/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous (SCAR/WAVE)-like protein. We found that TUT1 contains conserved functional domains found in eukaryotic SCAR/WAVE proteins, and was able to activate Actin-related protein2/3 to promote actin nucleation and polymerization in vitro. Consistently, tut1 mutants show defects in the arrangement of actin filaments in trichome. These results indicate that TUT1 is a functional SCAR/WAVE protein and plays an important role in panicle development.
26252898	Comprehensive Evolutionary and Expression Analysis of FCS-Like Zinc finger Gene Family Yields Insights into Their Origin, Expansion and Divergence.	2015	PLoS One	Plant evolution is characterized by frequent genome duplication events. Expansion of habitat resulted in the origin of many novel genes and genome duplication events which in turn resulted in the expansion of many regulatory gene families. The plant-specific FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) gene family is characterized by the presence of a FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) domain which mediates the protein-protein interaction. In this study, we identified that the expansion of FLZ gene family size in different species is correlated with ancestral and lineage-specific whole genome duplication events. The subsequent gene loss found to have a greater role in determining the size of this gene family in many species. However, genomic block duplications played the significant role in the expansion of FLZ gene family in some species. Comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa FLZ gene family revealed monocot and dicot specific evolutionary trends. The FLZ genes were found to be under high purifying selection. The spatiotemporal expression analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana FLZ gene family revealed that majority of the members are highly expressed in reproductive organs. FLZ genes were also found to be highly expressed during vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition which is correlated with the proposed role of this gene family in sugar signaling. The comparison of sequence, structural and expression features of duplicated genes identified lineage-specific redundancy and divergence. This extensive evolutionary analysis and expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana FLZ genes will pave the way for further functional analysis of FLZ genes.
26257333	Biochemical characterization and selective inhibition of β-carotene cis-trans isomerase D27 and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase CCD8 on the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway.	2015	FEBS J	The first three enzymatic steps of the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway catalysed by β-carotene cis-trans isomerase Dwarf27 (D27) from Oryza sativa and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases CCD7 and CCD8 from Arabidopsis thaliana have been reconstituted in vitro, and kinetic assays have been developed for each enzyme, in order to develop selective enzyme inhibitors. Recombinant OsD27 shows a UV-visible λmax at 422 nm and is inactivated by silver(I) acetate, consistent with the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster that is used in catalysis. OsD27 and AtCCD7 are not inhibited by hydroxamic acids that cause shoot branching in planta, but OsD27 is partially inhibited by terpene-like hydroxamic acids. The reaction catalysed by AtCCD8 is shown to be a two-step kinetic mechanism using pre-steady-state kinetic analysis. Kinetic evidence is presented for acid-base catalysis in the CCD8 catalytic cycle and the existence of an essential cysteine residue in the CCD8 active site. AtCCD8 is inhibited in a time-dependent fashion by hydroxamic acids D2, D4, D5 and D6 (> 95% inhibition at 100 μm) that cause a shoot branching phenotype in A. thaliana, and selective inhibition of CCD8 is observed using hydroxamic acids D13H and D15 (82%, 71% inhibition at 10 μm). The enzyme inhibition data imply that the biochemical basis of the shoot branching phenotype is due to inhibition of CCD8.
26248667	Xanthomonas campestris cell-cell signalling molecule DSF (diffusible signal factor) elicits innate immunity in plants and is suppressed by the exopolysaccharide xanthan.	2015	J Exp Bot	Several secreted and surface-associated conserved microbial molecules are recognized by the host to mount the defence response. One such evolutionarily well-conserved bacterial process is the production of cell-cell signalling molecules which regulate production of multiple virulence functions by a process known as quorum sensing. Here it is shown that a bacterial fatty acid cell-cell signalling molecule, DSF (diffusible signal factor), elicits innate immunity in plants. The DSF family of signalling molecules are highly conserved among many phytopathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Xanthomonas as well as in opportunistic animal pathogens. Using Arabidopsis, Nicotiana benthamiana, and rice as model systems, it is shown that DSF induces a hypersensitivity reaction (HR)-like response, programmed cell death, the accumulation of autofluorescent compounds, hydrogen peroxide production, and the expression of the PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 (PR-1) gene. Furthermore, production of the DSF signalling molecule in Pseudomonas syringae, a non-DSF-producing plant pathogen, induces the innate immune response in the N. benthamiana host plant and also affects pathogen growth. By pre- and co-inoculation of DSF, it was demonstrated that the DSF-induced plant defence reduces disease severity and pathogen growth in the host plant. In this study, it was further demonstrated that wild-type Xanthomonas campestris suppresses the DSF-induced innate immunity by secreting xanthan, the main component of extracellular polysaccharide. The results indicate that plants have evolved to recognize a widely conserved bacterial communication system and may have played a role in the co-evolution of host recognition of the pathogen and the communication machinery.
26318216	Nicotiana sylvestris calcineurin B-like protein NsylCBL10 enhances salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Nicotiana sylvestris calcineurin B-like protein NsylCBL10 improves tolerance to high-salt stress through better maintenance of Na (+) balance. The calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins represent a unique group of plant calcium sensors and play an important role in regulating the response of a plant cell to the stress. Although many studies have been made in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa), the characterization and elucidation of the functions of CBLs in tobacco have not yet been reported. In this study, NsylCBL10, a CBL gene showing higher similarities to other CBL10 genes, was cloned from Nicotiana sylvestris. NsylCBL10 is expressed in most of the tobacco tissues, and the protein targets to the plasma membrane specifically. Over-expression of NsylCBL10 enhanced the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis wild type plants greatly, and rescued the high-salt-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis cbl10 mutant. The analysis of ion content indicated that over-expressing NsylCBL10 in plants is able to maintain a lower Na(+)/K(+) ratio in roots and higher Na(+)/K(+) ratio in shoots, compared with cbl10 mutant. The results suggest that NsylCBL10 might play an important role in response to high salinity stress in N. sylvestris, by keeping a better ionic homeostasis to reduce the damage of toxic ion to the plant cell.
26243630	A chemical genetic strategy identify the PHOSTIN, a synthetic molecule that triggers phosphate starvation responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2016	New Phytol	Plants display numerous strategies to cope with phosphate (Pi)-deficiency. Despite multiple genetic studies, the molecular mechanisms of low-Pi-signalling remain unknown. To validate the interest of chemical genetics to investigate this pathway we discovered and analysed the effects of PHOSTIN (PSN), a drug mimicking Pi-starvation in Arabidopsis. We assessed the effects of PSN and structural analogues on the induction of Pi-deficiency responses in mutants and wild-type and followed their accumulation in plants organs by high pressure liquid chromotography (HPLC) or mass-spectrophotometry. We show that PSN is cleaved in the growth medium, releasing its active motif (PSN11), which accumulates in plants roots. Despite the overaccumulation of Pi in the roots of treated plants, PSN11 elicits both local and systemic Pi-starvation effects. Nevertheless, albeit that the transcriptional activation of low-Pi genes by PSN11 is lost in the phr1;phl1 double mutant, neither PHO1 nor PHO2 are required for PSN11 effects. The range of local and systemic responses to Pi-starvation elicited, and their dependence on the PHR1/PHL1 function suggests that PSN11 affects an important and early step of Pi-starvation signalling. Its independence from PHO1 and PHO2 suggest the existence of unknown pathway(s), showing the usefulness of PSN and chemical genetics to bring new elements to this field.
26304198	Structural basis of pathogen recognition by an integrated HMA domain in a plant NLR immune receptor.	2015	Elife	Plants have evolved intracellular immune receptors to detect pathogen proteins known as effectors. How these immune receptors detect effectors remains poorly understood. Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik, an effector from the rice blast pathogen, by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro, and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event, mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR, which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease. Such studies underpin novel opportunities for engineering disease resistance to plant pathogens in staple food crops.
26241330	"PP2C7s", Genes Most Highly Elaborated in Photosynthetic Organisms, Reveal the Bacterial Origin and Stepwise Evolution of PPM/PP2C Protein Phosphatases.	2015	PLoS One	Mg+2/Mn+2-dependent type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, mediating diverse cellular signaling processes through metal ion catalyzed dephosphorylation of target proteins. We have identified a distinct PP2C sequence class ("PP2C7s") which is nearly universally distributed in Eukaryotes, and therefore apparently ancient. PP2C7s are by far most prominent and diverse in plants and green algae. Combining phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization predictions, and a distillation of publically available gene expression data, we have traced the evolutionary trajectory of this gene family in photosynthetic eukaryotes, demonstrating two major sequence assemblages featuring a succession of increasingly derived sub-clades. These display predominant expression moving from an ancestral pattern in photosynthetic tissues toward non-photosynthetic, specialized and reproductive structures. Gene co-expression network composition strongly suggests a shifting pattern of PP2C7 gene functions, including possible regulation of starch metabolism for one homologue set in Arabidopsis and rice. Distinct plant PP2C7 sub-clades demonstrate novel amino terminal protein sequences upon motif analysis, consistent with a shifting pattern of regulation of protein function. More broadly, neither the major events in PP2C sequence evolution, nor the origin of the diversity of metal binding characteristics currently observed in different PP2C lineages, are clearly understood. Identification of the PP2C7 sequence clade has allowed us to provide a better understanding of both of these issues. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons using Hidden Markov Models strongly suggest that PP2Cs originated in Bacteria (Group II PP2C sequences), entered Eukaryotes through the ancestral mitochondrial endosymbiosis, elaborated in Eukaryotes, then re-entered Bacteria through an inter-domain gene transfer, ultimately producing bacterial Group I PP2C sequences. A key evolutionary event, occurring first in ancient Eukaryotes, was the acquisition of a conserved aspartate in classic Motif 5. This has been inherited subsequently by PP2C7s, eukaryotic PP2Cs and bacterial Group I PP2Cs, where it is crucial to the formation of a third metal binding pocket, and catalysis.
26282053	Maize orthologs of rice GS5 and their trans-regulator are associated with kernel development.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Genome information from model species such as rice can assist in the cloning of genes in a complex genome, such as maize. Here, we identified a maize ortholog of rice GS5 that contributes to kernel development in maize. The genome-wide association analysis of the expression levels of ZmGS5, and 15 of its 26 paralogs, identified a trans-regulator on chromosome 7, which was a BAK1-like gene. This gene that we named as ZmBAK1-7 could regulate the expression of ZmGS5 and three of the paralogs. Candidate-gene association analyses revealed that these five genes were associated with maize kernel development-related traits. Linkage analyses also detected that ZmGS5 and ZmBAK1-7 co-localized with mapped QTLs. A transgenic analysis of ZmGS5 in Arabidopsis thaliana L. showed a significant increase in seed weight and cell number, suggesting that ZmGS5 may have a conserved function among different plant species that affects seed development.
26309725	Development of an image-based screening system for inhibitors of the plastidial MEP pathway and of protein geranylgeranylation.	2015	F1000Res	In a preceding study we have recently established an in vivo visualization system for the geranylgeranylation of proteins in a stably transformed tobacco BY-2 cell line, which involves expressing a dexamethasone-inducible GFP fused to the prenylable, carboxy-terminal basic domain of the rice calmodulin CaM61, which naturally bears a CaaL geranylgeranylation motif (GFP-BD-CVIL). By using pathway-specific inhibitors it was there demonstrated that inhibition of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway with oxoclomazone and fosmidomycin, as well as inhibition of protein geranylgeranyl transferase type 1 (PGGT-1), shifted the localization of the GFP-BD-CVIL protein from the membrane to the nucleus. In contrast, the inhibition of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway with mevinolin did not affect this localization. Furthermore, in this initial study complementation assays with pathway-specific intermediates confirmed that the precursors for the cytosolic isoprenylation of this fusion protein are predominantly provided by the MEP pathway. In order to optimize this visualization system from a more qualitative assay to a statistically trustable medium or a high-throughput screening system, we established now new conditions that permit culture and analysis in 96-well microtiter plates, followed by fluorescence microscopy. For further refinement, the existing GFP-BD-CVIL cell line was transformed with an estradiol-inducible vector driving the expression of a RFP protein, C-terminally fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-RFP). We are thus able to quantify the total number of viable cells versus the number of inhibited cells after various treatments. This approach also includes a semi-automatic counting system, based on the freely available image processing software. As a result, the time of image analysis as well as the risk of user-generated bias is reduced to a minimum. Moreover, there is no cross-induction of gene expression by dexamethasone and estradiol, which is an important prerequisite for this test system.
26297139	Overexpression of BAX INHIBITOR-1 Links Plasma Membrane Microdomain Proteins to Stress.	2015	Plant Physiol	BAX INHIBITOR-1 (BI-1) is a cell death suppressor widely conserved in plants and animals. Overexpression of BI-1 enhances tolerance to stress-induced cell death in plant cells, although the molecular mechanism behind this enhancement is unclear. We recently found that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BI-1 is involved in the metabolism of sphingolipids, such as the synthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acids, suggesting the involvement of sphingolipids in the cell death regulatory mechanism downstream of BI-1. Here, we show that BI-1 affects cell death-associated components localized in sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane in rice (Oryza sativa) cells. The amount of 2-hydroxy fatty acid-containing glucosylceramide increased in the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM; a biochemical counterpart of plasma membrane microdomains) fraction obtained from BI-1-overexpressing rice cells. Comparative proteomics analysis showed quantitative changes of DRM proteins in BI-1-overexpressing cells. In particular, the protein abundance of FLOTILLIN HOMOLOG (FLOT) and HYPERSENSITIVE-INDUCED REACTION PROTEIN3 (HIR3) markedly decreased in DRM of BI-1-overexpressing cells. Loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that FLOT and HIR3 are required for cell death by oxidative stress and salicylic acid, suggesting that the decreased levels of these proteins directly contribute to the stress-tolerant phenotypes in BI-1-overexpressing rice cells. These findings provide a novel biological implication of plant membrane microdomains in stress-induced cell death, which is negatively modulated by BI-1 overexpression via decreasing the abundance of a set of key proteins involved in cell death.
26319557	Comparative analysis of DNA methylation changes in two rice genotypes under salt stress and subsequent recovery.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	DNA methylation, which is one of the best understood epigenetic phenomena, plays an important role in plant responses to environmental stimuli. The rice introgression line IL177-103 and its recurrent parent IR64, which show contrasting salt stress tolerance, were used to characterize DNA methylation changes under salt stress and subsequent recovery using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis. The introgression line IL177-103 showed significantly improved tolerance to salinity, as represented by higher relative water content, endogenous abscisic acid content, activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes, and lower Na(+) concentration in shoots, compared with IR64. The MSAP results showed that less than 10.5% of detected DNA methylation sites were genotype specific, in line with their similar genetic background. Salt-induced DNA methylation changes in both genotypes were mostly detected in roots, and the major portion of the salt-induced DNA demethylation/methylation alterations remained even after recovery, implying their inheritance in the present generation. Furthermore, a few sites with stable DNA methylation differences were identified between salt-tolerant IL177-103 and salt-sensitive IR64, thus providing genotype-specific epigenetic markers. Collectively, these results provide valuable data for further dissection of the molecular mechanisms of salt-stress response and tolerance in rice.
26321658	Comparison of Sub1 markers and their combinations for submergence tolerance and analysis of adaptation strategies of rice in rainfed lowland ecology.	2015	C R Biol	Ninety lowland rice cultivars of the eastern region of India were collected and screened for submergence and water logging tolerance and further used for validating the efficiency of molecular markers and their combinations for submergence tolerance. Submergence tolerance and elongation ability of the tested genotypes were measured in screening tanks along with tolerant and susceptible checks. The genotypes FR13A, Khoda, CR Dhan 300, Savitri Sub1, IR64 Sub1, IC-568009 and IC-568842 exhibited high submergence tolerance may be used as donor in the breeding program. Landrace 'Khoda' showed tolerance to submergence with moderate elongation ability for adaption. Boitalpakhia, Gayatri, Atiranga, Aghonibora, Chakaakhi, Moti, IC-567993 and IC-568921 possessed both characters of moderate elongation ability and moderate tolerance to submergence. Both of these traits are required for lowland varieties of eastern India to survive under flash flood and accumulated stagnant water conditions. RM8300, Sub1A203, AEX, Sub1BC2 and Sub1C173 were employed for molecular screening to identify the submergence-tolerant genotypes. Sub1A203 was capable of differentiating the tolerant and susceptible genotypes into groups. RM8300 and Sub1BC2 could also differentiate the genotypes with inclusion of some susceptible genotypes. The AEX and Sub1C173 marker could not show discrimination among the genotypes with respect to the traits. Using Sub1A203+Sub1BC2 was better amongst the combinations studied. The results of the study indicated a trend toward a negative association of Sub1BC2 with submergence tolerance while AEX and Sub1C marker did not show any significant association. The donors identified can be useful as parental lines while the molecular markers can be used for marker-assisted breeding work.
26242818	Are all GMOs the same? Consumer acceptance of cisgenic rice in India.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	India has more than 215 million food-insecure people, many of whom are farmers. Genetically modified (GM) crops have the potential to alleviate this problem by increasing food supplies and strengthening farmer livelihoods. For this to occur, two factors are critical: (i) a change in the regulatory status of GM crops, and (ii) consumer acceptance of GM foods. There are generally two classifications of GM crops based on how they are bred: cisgenically bred, containing only DNA sequences from sexually compatible organisms; and transgenically bred, including DNA sequences from sexually incompatible organisms. Consumers may view cisgenic foods as more natural than those produced via transgenesis, thus influencing consumer acceptance. This premise was the catalyst for our study--would Indian consumers accept cisgenically bred rice and if so, how would they value cisgenics compared to conventionally bred rice, GM-labelled rice and 'no fungicide' rice? In this willingness-to-pay study, respondents did not view cisgenic and GM rice differently. However, participants were willing-to-pay a premium for any aforementioned rice with a 'no fungicide' attribute, which cisgenics and GM could provide. Although not significantly different (P = 0.16), 76% and 73% of respondents stated a willingness-to-consume GM and cisgenic foods, respectively.
26284908	Genome-Wide Association of Rice Blast Disease Resistance and Yield-Related Components of Rice.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Robust disease resistance may require an expenditure of energy that may limit crop yield potential. In the present study, a subset of a United States Department of Agriculture rice core collection consisting of 151 accessions was selected using a major blast resistance (R) gene, Pi-ta, marker and was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Disease reactions to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions, and heading date, plant height, paddy and brown seed weight in two field environments were analyzed, using an association mapping approach. A total of 21 SSR markers distributed among rice chromosomes 2 to 12 were associated with blast resistance, and 16 SSR markers were associated with seed weight, heading date, and plant height. Most noticeably, shorter plants were significantly correlated with resistance to blast, rice genomes with Pi-ta were associated with lighter seed weights, and the susceptible alleles of RM171 and RM6544 were associated with heavier seed weight. These findings unraveled a complex relationship between disease resistance and yield-related components.
26318142	Inhibitory effects of a novel cationic dodecapeptide [CL(14-25)] derived from cyanate lyase of rice on endotoxic activities of LPSs from Escherichia coli and periodontopathic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.	2016	Microb Pathog	OBJECTIVE: CL(14-25), a dodecapeptide of cyanate lyase from rice, is a novel cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptide. In this study, we examined inhibitory ability of CL(14-25) against endotoxic activities of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Escherichia coli and periodontal pathogenic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.

METHODS: Endotoxin-neutralizing activity of CL(14-25) was evaluated by inhibition to induction of cytokine and nitric oxide in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and RAW264 mouse macrophage cells, respectively. Protective effect of CL(14-25) was determined in mice against lethal toxicity of LPS.

RESULTS: IL-6 in HAECs was induced by stimulation with LPS preparations of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. coli tested in this study, and addition of CL(14-25) to the medium caused inhibition of their induction in a dose-dependent manner. CL(14-25) inhibited NO induction in RAW264 cells by a smooth type LPS of E. coli O55:B5 and an Rc type LPS of E. coli J5 as well as lipid A of E. coli R515 in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous injection of E. coli O55:B5 LPS and CL(14-25) in BALB/c mice resulted in prevention of lethal toxicity of the former. The results of a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis of interaction between CL(14-25) and E. coli LPS or lipid A showed that CL(14-25) specifically binds to a lipid A moiety of LPS.

CONCLUSION: The results of present study suggest that CL(14-25) has a potential to be used as a nutraceutical agent for periodontal therapy.
26243619	EARLY SENESCENCE1 Encodes a SCAR-LIKE PROTEIN2 That Affects Water Loss in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	The global problem of drought threatens agricultural production and constrains the development of sustainable agricultural practices. In plants, excessive water loss causes drought stress and induces early senescence. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, designated as early senescence1 (es1), which exhibits early leaf senescence. The es1-1 leaves undergo water loss at the seedling stage (as reflected by whitening of the leaf margin and wilting) and display early senescence at the three-leaf stage. We used map-based cloning to identify ES1, which encodes a SCAR-LIKE PROTEIN2, a component of the suppressor of cAMP receptor/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous complex involved in actin polymerization and function. The es1-1 mutants exhibited significantly higher stomatal density. This resulted in excessive water loss and accelerated water flow in es1-1, also enhancing the water absorption capacity of the roots and the water transport capacity of the stems as well as promoting the in vivo enrichment of metal ions cotransported with water. The expression of ES1 is higher in the leaves and leaf sheaths than in other tissues, consistent with its role in controlling water loss from leaves. GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN-ES1 fusion proteins were ubiquitously distributed in the cytoplasm of plant cells. Collectively, our data suggest that ES1 is important for regulating water loss in rice.

26243626	Understanding rice adaptation to varying agro-ecosystems: trait interactions and quantitative trait loci.	2015	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Interaction and genetic control for traits influencing the adaptation of the rice crop to varying environments was studied in a mapping population derived from parents (Moroberekan and Swarna) contrasting for drought tolerance, yield potential, lodging resistance, and adaptation to dry direct seeding. A BC2F3-derived mapping population for traits related to these four trait groups was phenotyped to understand the interactions among traits and to map and align QTLs using composite interval mapping (CIM). The study also aimed to identify QTLs for the four trait groups as composite traits using multivariate least square interval mapping (MLSIM) to further understand the genetic control of these traits.

RESULTS: Significant correlations between drought- and yield-related traits at seedling and reproductive stages respectively with traits for adaptation to dry direct-seeded conditions were observed. CIM and MLSIM methods were applied to identify QTLs for univariate and composite traits. QTL clusters showing alignment of QTLs for several traits within and across trait groups were detected at chromosomes 3, 4, and 7 through CIM. The largest number of QTLs related to traits belonging to all four trait groups were identified on chromosome 3 close to the qDTY 3.2 locus. These included QTLs for traits such as bleeding rate, shoot biomass, stem strength, and spikelet fertility. Multivariate QTLs were identified at loci supported by univariate QTLs such as on chromosomes 3 and 4 as well as at distinctly different loci on chromosome 8 which were undetected through CIM.

CONCLUSION: Rice requires better adaptation across a wide range of environments and cultivation practices to adjust to climate change. Understanding the genetics and trade-offs related to each of these environments and cultivation practices thus becomes highly important to develop varieties with stability of yield across them. This study provides a wider picture of the genetics and physiology of adaptation of rice to wide range of environments. With a complete understanding of the processes and relationships between traits and trait groups, marker-assisted breeding can be used more efficiently to develop plant types that can combine all or most of the beneficial traits and show high stability across environments, ecosystems, and cultivation practices.
26276867	Mutation of SPOTTED LEAF3 (SPL3) impairs abscisic acid-responsive signalling and delays leaf senescence in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Lesion mimic mutants commonly display spontaneous cell death in pre-senescent green leaves under normal conditions, without pathogen attack. Despite molecular and phenotypic characterization of several lesion mimic mutants, the mechanisms of the spontaneous formation of cell death lesions remain largely unknown. Here, the rice lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf3 (spl3) was examined. When grown under a light/dark cycle, the spl3 mutant appeared similar to wild-type at early developmental stages, but lesions gradually appeared in the mature leaves close to heading stage. By contrast, in spl3 mutants grown under continuous light, severe cell death lesions formed in developing leaves, even at the seedling stage. Histochemical analysis showed that hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the mutant, likely causing the cell death phenotype. By map-based cloning and complementation, it was shown that a 1-bp deletion in the first exon of Oryza sativa Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase1 (OsMAPKKK1)/OsEDR1/OsACDR1 causes the spl3 mutant phenotype. The spl3 mutant was found to be insensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), showing normal root growth in ABA-containing media and delayed leaf yellowing during dark-induced and natural senescence. Expression of ABA signalling-associated genes was also less responsive to ABA treatment in the mutant. Furthermore, the spl3 mutant had lower transcript levels and activities of catalases, which scavenge hydrogen peroxide, probably due to impairment of ABA-responsive signalling. Finally, a possible molecular mechanism of lesion formation in the mature leaves of spl3 mutant is discussed.
26293787	Discovery and mapping of genomic regions governing economically important traits of Basmati rice.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Basmati rice, originated in the foothills of Himalayas, commands a premium price in the domestic and international markets on account of its unique quality traits. The complex genetic nature of unique traits of Basmati as well as tedious screening methodologies involved in quality testing have been serious constraints to breeding quality Basmati. In the present study, we made an attempt to identify the genomic regions governing unique traits of Basmati rice.

RESULTS: A total of 34 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for 16 economically important traits of Basmati rice were identified employing F(2), F(3) and Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) mapping populations derived from a cross between Basmati370 (traditional Basmati) and Jaya (semi-dwarf rice). Out of which, 12 QTLs contributing to more than 15 % phenotypic variance were identified and considered as major effect QTLs. Four major effect QTLs coincide with the already known genes viz., sd1, GS3, alk1 and fgr governing plant height, grain size, alkali spreading value and aroma, respectively. For the remaining major QTLs, candidate genes were predicted as auxin response factor for filled grains, soluble starch synthase 3 for chalkiness and VQ domain containing protein for grain breadth and grain weight QTLs, based on the presence of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that were identified by comparing Basmati genome sequence with that of Nipponbare.

CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt ever made to carry out genome-wide mapping for the dissection of the genetic basis of economically important traits of Basmati rice. The promising QTLs controlling important traits in Basmati rice, identified in this study, can be used as candidates for future marker-assisted breeding.
26043067	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and grain weight in rice.	2015	Plant J	Plant breeding relies on creation of novel allelic combinations for desired traits. Identification and utilization of beneficial alleles, rare alleles and evolutionarily conserved genes in the germplasm (referred to as 'hidden' genes) provide an effective approach to achieve this goal. Here we show that a chemically induced null mutation in an evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, alters multiple important agronomic traits in rice, including panicle architecture, grain shape and grain weight. FUWA encodes an NHL domain-containing protein, with preferential expression in the root meristem, shoot apical meristem and inflorescences, where it restricts excessive cell division. Sequence analysis revealed that FUWA has undergone a bottleneck effect, and become fixed in landraces and modern cultivars during domestication and breeding. We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologs in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation. Strikingly, knockdown of the FUWA transcription level by RNA interference results in an erect panicle and increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds. This study illustrates an approach to create new germplasm with improved agronomic traits for crop breeding by tapping into evolutionary conserved genes.
26317412	Functional Characterization of Phalaenopsis aphrodite Flowering Genes PaFT1 and PaFD.	2015	PLoS One	We show that the key flowering regulators encoded by Phalaenopsis aphrodite FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (PaFT1) and PaFD share high sequence homologies to these from long-day flowering Arabidopsis and short-day flowering rice. Interestingly, PaFT1 is specifically up-regulated during flowering inductive cooling treatment but is not subjected to control by photoperiod in P. aphrodite. Phloem or shoot apex-specific expression of PaFT1 restores the late flowering of Arabidopsis ft mutants. Moreover, PaFT1 can suppress the delayed flowering caused by SHORT VEGATATIVE PHASE (SVP) overexpression as well as an active FRIGIDA (FRI) allele, indicating the functional conservation of flowering regulatory circuit in different plant species. PaFT1 promoter:GUS in Arabidopsis showed similar staining pattern to that of Arabidopsis FT in the leaves and guard cells but different in the shoot apex. A genomic clone or heat shock-inducible expression of PaFT1 is sufficient to the partial complementation of the ft mutants. Remarkably, ectopic PaFT1 expression also triggers precocious heading in rice. To further demonstrate the functional conservation of the flowering regulators, we show that PaFD, a bZIP transcription factor involved in flowering promotion, interacts with PaFT1, and PaFD partially complemented Arabidopsis fd mutants. Transgenic rice expressing PaFD also flowered early with increased expression of rice homologues of APETALA1 (AP1). Consistently, PaFT1 knock-down Phalaenopsis plants generated by virus-induced gene silencing exhibit delayed spiking. These studies suggest functional conservation of FT and FD genes, which may have evolved and integrated into distinct regulatory circuits in monopodial orchids, Arabidopsis and rice that promote flowering under their own inductive conditions.
26319531	Promoter methylation regulates the abundance of osa-miR393a in contrasting rice genotypes under salinity stress.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important molecules that regulate gene expression under salinity stress. Despite their evolutionary conservation, these regulatory elements have been shown to behave differently in different plant species under a particular environmental stress. In this study, we investigated the behavior of salt responsive osa-miR393a and its target gene (TIR1, LOC_Os05g05800) in salt-tolerant (FL478) and salt-sensitive (IR29) rice genotypes. It was found that the mature and precursor sequences of osa-miR393a as well as its cleavage site in TIR1 were conserved among salt tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Promoters of different salt-responsive miRNAs were also found to be less variable between salt-tolerant and salt-susceptible genotypes. Analysis of gene expression, promoter methylation, and cis-element abundance showed that osa-miR393a behaves differently in FL478 and IR29. Salt stress altered the expression pattern of osa-miR393a-TIR1 module in a time-dependent manner in the roots and shoots of two genotypes. Promoter methylation of this regulatory module was also altered at different time points under salt stress. Expression analysis in two genotypes indicated the overall down-regulation of osa-miR393a and up-regulation of TIR1 in FL478 and their reciprocal regulation in IR29. The expression results were complemented by the differential promoter methylation and cis-element abundance of this regulatory module. Together, the results of transcript abundance and promoter methylation of osa-miR393a-TIR1 module signified the association between these two processes which is reported for the first time in plants to the best of our knowledge.
26302743	Genome-wide identification, phylogeny and expression analysis of GRAS gene family in tomato.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: GRAS transcription factors usually act as integrators of multiple growth regulatory and environmental signals, including axillary shoot meristem formation, root radial pattering, phytohormones, light signaling, and abiotic/biotic stress. However, little is known about this gene family in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the most important model plant for crop species with fleshy fruits.

RESULTS: In this study, 53 GRAS genes were identified and renamed based on tomato whole-genome sequence and their respective chromosome distribution except 19 members were kept as their already existed name. Multiple sequence alignment showed typical GRAS domain in these proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of GRAS proteins from tomato, Arabidopsis, Populus, P.mume, and Rice revealed that SlGRAS proteins could be divided into at least 13 subfamilies. SlGRAS24 and SlGRAS40 were identified as target genes of miR171 using5'-RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends). qRT-PCR analysis revealed tissue-/organ- and development stage-specific expression patterns of SlGRAS genes. Moreover, their expression patterns in response to different hormone and abiotic stress treatments were also investigated.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of GRAS gene family in the tomato genome. The data will undoubtedly be useful for better understanding the potential functions of GRAS genes, and their possible roles in mediating hormone cross-talk and abiotic stress in tomato as well as in some other relative species.
26319516	Rice MEL2, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) protein, binds in vitro to meiosis-expressed genes containing U-rich RNA consensus sequences in the 3'-UTR.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Post-transcriptional gene regulation by RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins through binding to cis-elements in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) is widely used in eukaryotes to complete various biological processes. Rice MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE2 (MEL2) is the RRM protein that functions in the transition to meiosis in proper timing. The MEL2 RRM preferentially associated with the U-rich RNA consensus, UUAGUU[U/A][U/G][A/U/G]U, dependently on sequences and proportionally to MEL2 protein amounts in vitro. The consensus sequences were located in the putative looped structures of the RNA ligand. A genome-wide survey revealed a tendency of MEL2-binding consensus appearing in 3'-UTR of rice genes. Of 249 genes that conserved the consensus in their 3'-UTR, 13 genes spatiotemporally co-expressed with MEL2 in meiotic flowers, and included several genes whose function was supposed in meiosis; such as Replication protein A and OsMADS3. The proteome analysis revealed that the amounts of small ubiquitin-related modifier-like protein and eukaryotic translation initiation factor3-like protein were dramatically altered in mel2 mutant anthers. Taken together with transcriptome and gene ontology results, we propose that the rice MEL2 is involved in the translational regulation of key meiotic genes on 3'-UTRs to achieve the faithful transition of germ cells to meiosis.

26238949	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Artificial selection of high yield crops and better livestock is paramount importance in breeding programs. Selection of elite parents with preferred traits from a phalanx of inbred lines is extremely laborious, time-consuming and highly random. General combining ability (GCA) was proposed and has been widely used for the evaluation of parents in hybrid breeding for more than half a century. However, the genetic and molecular basis of GCA has been largely overlooked. Here, we present two pleotropic QTLs are accounting for GCA of days to heading (DTH), plant height (PH) and spikelet per panicle (SPP) using an F2-based NCII design, the BC3F2 population as well as a set of nearly isogenic lines (NILs) with five testers. Both GCA1 and GCA2 were loss-of-function gene in low-GCA parent and gain-of-function gene in high-GCA parent, encoding the putative Pseudo-Response Regulators, OsPRR37 and Ghd7, respectively. Overexpression of GCA1 in low-GCA parent significantly increases GCA effects in three traits. Our results demonstrate that two GCA loci associate with OsPRR37 and Ghd7 and reveal that the genes responsible for important agronomic traits could simultaneously account for GCA effects.
26320209	Geometrical Formation of Compound Starch Grains in Rice Implements Voronoi Diagram.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Starch forms transparent grains, called starch grains (SGs), in amyloplasts. One of the major morphological SG forms in Poaceae, called a compound SG, is formed by assemblies of small starch granules in an amyloplast. Starch granules assemble as a well-ordered structure; however, the mechanism that regulates this organization has not been identified. In this study, we examined how starch granules grow and converge into the final SG morphology. First, we found that the number of starch granules in an amyloplast is almost constant from the early developmental stage until endosperm maturity. Next, we quantitatively evaluated the geometrical similarities between starch granules and a Voronoi diagram, which is a mathematical tessellation of space based on the distance to a specific set of points in the space. The in silico growth simulation showed that the geometrical patterns of compound SGs resembling a Voronoi diagram is determined by physical interactions among the free-growing starch granules and the amyloplast envelope membrane. The geometrical similarity between compound SGs and a Voronoi diagram is likely a result of maximum loading and storage of starch in the amyloplast. The simulation described in this study provides a greater understanding of how compound SGs are formed and also has the potential to explain morphological variations of SGs.
26261267	A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC3 confers heat and drought tolerance through modulation of reactive oxygen species in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Adverse environmental conditions such as high temperature and drought stress greatly limit the growth and production of crops worldwide. Several NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) proteins have been documented as important regulators in stress responses, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, SNAC3 (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported. SNAC3 was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses. The SNAC3-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that SNAC3 may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the SNAC3-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the SNAC3-RNAi transgenic plants. Five ROS-associated genes which were up-regulated in SNAC3-OE plants showed co-expression patterns with SNAC3, and three of the co-expressed ROS-associated enzyme genes were verified to be direct target genes of SNAC3. These results suggest that SNAC3 plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress.
26258482	Resequencing Reveals Different Domestication Rate for BADH1 and BADH2 in Rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	PLoS One	BADH1 and BADH2 are two homologous genes, encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice. In the present study, we scanned BADHs sequences of 295 rice cultivars, and 10 wild rice accessions to determine the polymorphisms, gene functions and domestication of these two genes. A total of 16 alleles for BADH1 and 10 alleles for BADH2 were detected in transcribed region of cultivars and wild species. Association study showed that BADH1 has significant correlation with salt tolerance in rice during germination stage, the SNP (T/A) in exon 4 is highly correlated with salt tolerance index (STI) (P<10(-4)). While, BADH2 was only responsible for rice fragrance, of which two BADH2 alleles (8 bp deletion in exon 7 and C/T SNP in exon 13) explain 97% of aroma variation in our germplasm. Theses indicate that there are no overlapping functions between the two homologous genes. In addition, a large LD block was detected in BADH2 region, however, there was no large LD blocks in a 4-Mb region of BADH1. We found that BADH2 region only showed significant bias in Tajima's D value from the balance. Extended haplotype homozygosity study revealed fragrant accessions had a large LD block that extended around the mutation site (8 bp deletion in exon 7) of BADH2, while both of the BADH1 alleles (T/A in exon 4) did not show large extended LD block. All these results suggested that BADH2 was domesticated during rice evolution, while BADH1 was not selected by human beings.
26254327	Overexpressing OsPIN2 enhances aluminium internalization by elevating vesicular trafficking in rice root apex.	2015	J Exp Bot	Aluminium (Al) sequestration is required for internal detoxification of Al in plant cells. In this study, it was found that the rice OsPIN2 overexpression line (OX1) had significantly reduced Al content in its cell wall and increased Al concentration in cell sap only in rice root tips relative to the wild-type (WT). In comparison with WT, OX1 reduced morin staining of cytosolic Al, enhanced FM 4-64 staining of membrane vesicular trafficking in root tip sections (0-1mm), and showed morin-FM 4-64 fluorescence overlap. Recovery treatment showed that cell-wall-bound Al was internalized into vacuoles via endocytic vesicular trafficking after removal of external Al. In this process, OX1 showed a higher rate of Al internalization than WT. Brefeldin A (BFA) interfered with vesicular trafficking and resulted in inhibition of Al internalization. This inhibitory effect could be alleviated when BFA was washed out, and the process of alleviation was slower in the cells of WT than in those of OX1. Microscopic observations revealed that, upon Al exposure, numerous multilamellar endosomes were detected between the cell wall and plasma membrane in the cells of OX1. Moreover, more vesicles enriched with Al complexes accumulated in the cells of OX1 than in those of WT, and these vesicles transformed into larger structures in the cells of OX1. Taken together, the data indicate that endocytic vesicular trafficking might contribute to Al internalization, and that overexpressing OsPIN2 enhances rice Al tolerance via elevated endocytic vesicular trafficking and Al internalization.
26296302	Restricting the above ground sink corrects the root/shoot ratio and substantially boosts the yield potential per panicle in field-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Physiol Plant	Rice has shallow, weak roots, but it is unknown how much increase in yield potential could be achieved if the root/shoot ratio is corrected. Removing all tillers except the main one, in a japonica (Sakha 101) and an indica (IR64) rice cultivar, instantly increased the root/shoot ratio from 0.21 to 1.16 in Sakha 101 and from 0.16 to 1.46 in IR64. Over 30 days after detillering, the root/shoot ratios of the detillered plants decreased to 0.49 in Sakha 101 and 0.46 in IR64 but remained significantly higher than in the controls. The detillered plants showed two- or fourfold increase in the main tiller fresh weight, as a consequence of more positive midday leaf relative water content (RWC), and consistently higher rates of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, but not transpiration, compared with the controls. The enhanced photosynthesis in Sakha 101 after detillering resulted from both improved water status and higher Rubisco contents whereas in IR64, increasing the Rubisco content did not contribute to improving photosynthesis. Detillering did not increase the carbohydrate contents of leaves but prevented starch depletion at the end of grain filling. The leaf protein content during vegetative and reproductive stages, the grain filling rate, the number of filled grains per panicle were greatly improved, bringing about 38.3 and 35.9% increase in the harvested grain dry weight per panicle in Sakha 101 and IR64, respectively. We provide evidence that improving the root performance by increasing the root/shoot ratio would eliminate the current limitations to photosynthesis and growth in rice.
26278778	Genome-wide DNA polymorphisms in low Phosphate tolerant and sensitive rice genotypes.	2015	Sci Rep	Soil Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major challenges to rice crop world-wide. Modern rice genotypes are highly P-responsive and rely on high input of P fertilizers. However, low P tolerant traditional cultivars and landraces have genetic potential to sustain well under low P. Identification of high resolution DNA polymorphisms (SNPs and InDels) in such contrasting genotypes is largely missing for low P response at gene levels. Here, we report high quality DNA polymorphisms in low P sensitive genotype, PB1 and tolerant traditional genotype, Dular. We performed whole genome resequencing using Illumina NGS platform and identified a total of 5,157,939 sequence variants in PB1 and Dular with reference to Nipponbare genome. We have identified approximately 2.3 million and 2.9 million high quality polymorphisms in PB1 and Dular, respectively, with an average read depth of ≥24X. We further mapped several DNA polymorphisms (non-synonymous and regulatory variants) having potential functional significance to key Phosphate Starvation Responsive (PSR) and root architecture genes in Dular and Kasalath using a compiled list of low P responsive genes. These identified variants can serve as a useful source of genetic variability for improving low P tolerance and root architecture of high yielding modern genotypes.
26313446	Accuracy of Genomic Selection in a Rice Synthetic Population Developed for Recurrent Selection Breeding.	2015	PLoS One	Genomic selection (GS) is a promising strategy for enhancing genetic gain. We investigated the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) in four inter-related synthetic populations that underwent several cycles of recurrent selection in an upland rice-breeding program. A total of 343 S2:4 lines extracted from those populations were phenotyped for flowering time, plant height, grain yield and panicle weight, and genotyped with an average density of one marker per 44.8 kb. The relative effect of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) and minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds for selecting markers, the relative size of the training population (TP) and of the validation population (VP), the selected trait and the genomic prediction models (frequentist and Bayesian) on the accuracy of GEBVs was investigated in 540 cross validation experiments with 100 replicates. The effect of kinship between the training and validation populations was tested in an additional set of 840 cross validation experiments with a single genomic prediction model. LD was high (average r2 = 0.59 at 25 kb) and decreased slowly, distribution of allele frequencies at individual loci was markedly skewed toward unbalanced frequencies (MAF average value 15.2% and median 9.6%), and differentiation between the four synthetic populations was low (FST ≤0.06). The accuracy of GEBV across all cross validation experiments ranged from 0.12 to 0.54 with an average of 0.30. Significant differences in accuracy were observed among the different levels of each factor investigated. Phenotypic traits had the biggest effect, and the size of the incidence matrix had the smallest. Significant first degree interaction was observed for GEBV accuracy between traits and all the other factors studied, and between prediction models and LD, MAF and composition of the TP. The potential of GS to accelerate genetic gain and breeding options to increase the accuracy of predictions are discussed.
26258667	MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS25 regulates root development through affection of nitrate accumulation in rice.	2015	PLoS One	MADS-box transcription factors are vital regulators participating in plant growth and development process and the functions of most of them are still unknown. ANR1 was reported to play a key role in controlling lateral root development through nitrate signal in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 is one of five ANR1-like genes in Oryza Sativa and belongs to the ANR1 clade. Here we have investigated the role of OsMADS25 in the plant's responses to external nitrate in Oryza Sativa. Our results showed that OsMADS25 protein was found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. Over-expression of OsMADS25 significantly promoted lateral and primary root growth as well as shoot growth in a nitrate-dependent manner in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 overexpression in transgenic rice resulted in significantly increased primary root length, lateral root number, lateral root length and shoot fresh weight in the presence of nitrate. Down-regulation of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice exhibited significantly reduced shoot and root growth in the presence of nitrate. Furthermore, over-expression of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice promoted nitrate accumulation and significantly increased the expressions of nitrate transporter genes at high rates of nitrate supply while down-regulation of OsMADS25 produced the opposite effect. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsMADS25 is a positive regulator control lateral and primary root development in rice.
26313002	Aquaporins Mediate Silicon Transport in Humans.	2015	PLoS One	In animals, silicon is an abundant and differentially distributed trace element that is believed to play important biological functions. One would thus expect silicon concentrations in body fluids to be regulated by silicon transporters at the surface of many cell types. Curiously, however, and even though they exist in plants and algae, no such transporters have been identified to date in vertebrates. Here, we show for the first time that the human aquaglyceroporins, i.e., AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10 can act as silicon transporters in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK-293 cells. In particular, heterologously expressed AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10 are all able to induce robust, saturable, phloretin-sensitive silicon transport activity in the range that was observed for low silicon rice 1 (lsi1), a silicon transporter in plant. Furthermore, we show that the aquaglyceroporins appear as relevant silicon permeation pathways in both mice and humans based on 1) the kinetics of substrate transport, 2) their presence in tissues where silicon is presumed to play key roles and 3) their transcriptional responses to changes in dietary silicon. Taken together, our data provide new evidence that silicon is a potentially important biological element in animals and that its body distribution is regulated. They should open up original areas of investigations aimed at deciphering the true physiological role of silicon in vertebrates.
26280413	Overexpression of receptor-like kinase ERECTA improves thermotolerance in rice and tomato.	2015	Nat Biotechnol	The detrimental effects of global warming on crop productivity threaten to reduce the world's food supply. Although plant responses to changes in temperature have been studied, genetic modification of crops to improve thermotolerance has had little success to date. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the Arabidopsis thaliana receptor-like kinase ERECTA (ER) in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato confers thermotolerance independent of water loss and that Arabidopsis er mutants are hypersensitive to heat. A loss-of-function mutation of a rice ER homolog and reduced expression of a tomato ER allele decreased thermotolerance of both species. Transgenic tomato and rice lines overexpressing Arabidopsis ER showed improved heat tolerance in the greenhouse and in field tests at multiple locations in China during several seasons. Moreover, ER-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis, tomato and rice plants had increased biomass. Our findings could contribute to engineering or breeding thermotolerant crops with no growth penalty.
26285801	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	DNA methylation loss can produce inheritable active epialleles in plants. The mechanism involved in the stable transmission of hypomethylated epimuations is presently not clear. Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele. CHR729 and JMJ703 have antagonistic function in H3K4me3 in maintaining the active state of the epiallele, whereas SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 was sufficient to stably repress the locus. The data suggest that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 controlled by these chromatin regulators may be involved in stable transmission/resetting of epigenetic variation in rice.
26322055	Melatonin mitigates cadmium phytotoxicity through modulation of phytochelatins biosynthesis, vacuolar sequestration, and antioxidant potential in Solanum lycopersicum L.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Melatonin is a ubiquitous signal molecule, playing crucial roles in plant growth and stress tolerance. Recently, toxic metal cadmium (Cd) has been reported to regulate melatonin content in rice; however, the function of melatonin under Cd stress, particularly in higher plants, still remains elusive. Here, we show that optimal dose of melatonin could effectively ameliorate Cd-induced phytotoxicity in tomato. The contents of Cd and melatonin were gradually increased over time under Cd stress. However, such increase in endogenous melatonin was incapable to reverse detrimental effects of Cd. Meanwhile, supplementation with melatonin conferred Cd tolerance as evident by plant biomass and photosynthesis. In addition to notable increase in antioxidant enzymes activity, melatonin-induced Cd stress mitigation was closely associated with enhanced H(+)-ATPase activity and the contents of glutathione and phytochelatins. Although exogenous melatonin had no effect on root Cd content, it significantly reduced leaf Cd content, indicating its role in Cd transport. Analysis of Cd in different subcellular compartments revealed that melatonin increased cell wall and vacuolar fractions of Cd. Our results suggest that melatonin-induced enhancements in antioxidant potential, phytochelatins biosynthesis and subsequent Cd sequestration might play a critical role in plant tolerance to Cd. Such a mechanism may have potential implication in safe food production.
26263547	Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) Complex in Plants: Genome Wide Identification, Evolutionary Conservation and Functional Determination.	2015	PLoS One	The recruitment of RNA polymerase II on a promoter is assisted by the assembly of basal transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes. The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex plays an important role in transcription regulation in eukaryotes. However, even in the advent of genome sequencing of various plants, SAGA complex has been poorly defined for their components and roles in plant development and physiological functions. Computational analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa genomes for SAGA complex resulted in the identification of 17 to 18 potential candidates for SAGA subunits. We have further classified the SAGA complex based on the conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SAGA complex proteins are evolutionary conserved between plants, yeast and mammals. Functional annotation showed that they participate not only in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, but also in different biological processes, which could be indirect and possibly mediated via the regulation of gene expression. The in silico expression analysis of the SAGA components in Arabidopsis and O. sativa clearly indicates that its components have a distinct expression profile at different developmental stages. The co-expression analysis of the SAGA components suggests that many of these subunits co-express at different developmental stages, during hormonal interaction and in response to stress conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of SAGA component genes further confirmed their expression in different plant tissues and stresses. The expression of representative salt, heat and light inducible genes were affected in mutant lines of SAGA subunits in Arabidopsis. Altogether, the present study reveals expedient evidences of involvement of the SAGA complex in plant gene regulation and stress responses.
26287170	Route and Regulation of Zinc, Cadmium, and Iron Transport in Rice Plants (Oryza sativa L.) during Vegetative Growth and Grain Filling: Metal Transporters, Metal Speciation, Grain Cd Reduction and Zn and Fe Biofortification.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) are essential but are sometimes deficient in humans, while cadmium (Cd) is toxic if it accumulates in the liver and kidneys at high levels. All three are contained in the grains of rice, a staple cereal. Zn and Fe concentrations in rice grains harvested under different levels of soil/hydroponic metals are known to change only within a small range, while Cd concentrations show greater changes. To clarify the mechanisms underlying such different metal contents, we synthesized information on the routes of metal transport and accumulation in rice plants by examining metal speciation, metal transporters, and the xylem-to-phloem transport system. At grain-filling, Zn and Cd ascending in xylem sap are transferred to the phloem by the xylem-to-phloem transport system operating at stem nodes. Grain Fe is largely derived from the leaves by remobilization. Zn and Fe concentrations in phloem-sap and grains are regulated within a small range, while Cd concentrations vary depending on xylem supply. Transgenic techniques to increase concentrations of the metal chelators (nicotianamine, 2'-deoxymugineic acid) are useful in increasing grain Zn and Fe concentrations. The elimination of OsNRAMP5 Cd-uptake transporter and the enhancement of root cell vacuolar Cd sequestration reduce uptake and root-to-shoot transport, respectively, resulting in a reduction of grain Cd accumulation.
26270815	Phytochrome B Mediates the Regulation of Chlorophyll Biosynthesis through Transcriptional Regulation of ChlH and GUN4 in Rice Seedlings.	2015	PLoS One	Accurate regulation of chlorophyll synthesis is crucial for chloroplast formation during the greening process in angiosperms. In this study, we examined the role of phytochrome B (phyB) in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) through the characterization of a pale-green phenotype observed in the phyB mutant grown under continuous red light (Rc) irradiation. Our results show that the Rc-induced chlorophyll accumulation can be divided into two components--a phyB-dependent and a phyB-independent component, and that the pale-green phenotype is caused by the absence of the phyB-dependent component. To elucidate the role of the missing component we established an Rc-induced greening experiment, the results of which revealed that several genes encoding proteins on the chlorophyll branch were repressed in the phyB mutant. Notable among them were ChlH and GUN4 genes, which encode subunit H and an activating factor of magnesium chelatase (Mg-chelatase), respectively, that were largely repressed in the mutant. Moreover, the kinetic profiles of chlorophyll precursors suggested that Mg-chelatase activity simultaneously decreased with the reduction in the transcript levels of ChlH and GUN4. These results suggest that phyB mediates the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis through transcriptional regulation of these two genes, whose products exert their action at the branching point of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Reduction of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) synthesis could be detected in the mutant, but the kinetic profiles of chlorophyll precursors indicated that it was an event posterior to the reduction of the Mg-chelatase activity. It means that the repression of 5-ALA synthesis should not be a triggering event for the appearance of the pale-green phenotype. Instead, the repression of 5-ALA synthesis might be important for the subsequent stabilization of the pale-green phenotype for preventing excessive accumulation of hazardous chlorophyll precursors, which is an inevitable consequence of the reduction of Mg-chelatase activity.
26272901	Genome-wide mapping of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in three rice cultivars reveals its preferential localization in transcriptionally silent transposable element genes.	2015	J Exp Bot	5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a modified form of cytosine that is considered the sixth nucleobase in DNA, has been detected in mammals and is believed to play an important role in gene regulation. In this study, 5hmC modification was detected in rice by employing a dot-blot assay, and its levels was further quantified in DNA from different rice tissues using liquid chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS/MS). The results showed large intertissue variation in 5hmC levels. The genome-wide profiles of 5hmC modification in three different rice cultivars were also obtained using a sensitive chemical labelling followed by a next-generation sequencing method. Thousands of 5hmC peaks were identified, and a comparison of the distributions of 5hmC among different rice cultivars revealed the specificity and conservation of 5hmC modification. The identified 5hmC peaks were significantly enriched in heterochromatin regions, and mainly located in transposable elements (TEs), especially around retrotransposons. The correlation analysis of 5hmC and gene expression data revealed a close association between 5hmC and silent TEs. These findings provide a resource for plant DNA 5hmC epigenetic studies and expand our knowledge of 5hmC modification.
26302213	Evaluating the Effect of Expressing a Peanut Resveratrol Synthase Gene in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Resveratrol (Res) is a type of natural plant stilbenes and phytoalexins that only exists in a few plant species. Studies have shown that the Res could be biosynthesized and accumulated within plants, once the complete metabolic pathway and related enzymes, such as the key enzyme resveratrol synthase (RS), existed. In this study, a RS gene named PNRS1 was cloned from the peanut, and the activity was confirmed in E. coli. Using transgenic approach, the PNRS1 transgenic rice was obtained. In T3 generation, the Res production and accumulation were further detected by HPLC. Our data revealed that compared to the wild type rice which trans-resveratrol was undetectable, in transgenic rice, the trans-resveratrol could be synthesized and achieved up to 0.697 μg/g FW in seedlings and 3.053 μg/g DW in seeds. Furthermore, the concentration of trans-resveratrol in transgenic rice seedlings could be induced up to eight or four-fold higher by ultraviolet (UV-C) or dark, respectively. Simultaneously, the endogenous increased of Res also showed the advantages in protecting the host plant from UV-C caused damage or dark-induced senescence. Our data indicated that Res was involved in host-defense responses against environmental stresses in transgenic rice. Here the results describes the processes of a peanut resveratrol synthase gene transformed into rice, and the detection of trans-resveratrol in transgenic rice, and the role of trans-resveratrol as a phytoalexin in transgenic rice when treated by UV-C and dark. These findings present new outcomes of transgenic approaches for functional genes and their corresponding physiological functions, and shed some light on broadening available resources of Res, nutritional improvement of crops, and new variety cultivation by genetic engineering.
26313122	Rice α-fucosidase active against plant complex type N-glycans containing Lewis a epitope: purification and characterization.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rice α-fucosidase (α-fucosidase Os, 58 kDa) that is active for α1-4 fucosyl linkage in Lewis a unit of plant N-glycans was purified to homogeneity. α-fucosidase Os showed activity against α1-3 fucosyl linkage in Lacto-N-fucopentaose III but not α1-3 fucosyl linkage in the core of plant N-glycans. The N-terminal sequence of α-fucosidase Os was identified as A-A-P-T-P-P-P-L-, and this sequence was found in the amino acid sequence of the putative rice α-fucosidase 1 (Os04g0560400).
26283788	Substrate Specificity and Possible Heterologous Targets of Phytaspase, a Plant Cell Death Protease.	2015	J Biol Chem	Plants lack aspartate-specific cell death proteases homologous to animal caspases. Instead, a subtilisin-like serine-dependent plant protease named phytaspase shown to be involved in the accomplishment of programmed death of plant cells is able to hydrolyze a number of peptide-based caspase substrates. Here, we determined the substrate specificity of rice (Oryza sativa) phytaspase by using the positional scanning substrate combinatorial library approach. Phytaspase was shown to display an absolute specificity of hydrolysis after an aspartic acid residue. The preceding amino acid residues, however, significantly influence the efficiency of hydrolysis. Efficient phytaspase substrates demonstrated a remarkable preference for an aromatic amino acid residue in the P3 position. The deduced optimum phytaspase recognition motif has the sequence IWLD and is strikingly hydrophobic. The established pattern was confirmed through synthesis and kinetic analysis of cleavage of a set of optimized peptide substrates. An amino acid motif similar to the phytaspase cleavage site is shared by the human gastrointestinal peptide hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin. In agreement with the established enzyme specificity, phytaspase was shown to hydrolyze gastrin-1 and cholecystokinin at the predicted sites in vitro, thus destroying the active moieties of the hormones.
26322072	Host and non-host roots in rice: cellular and molecular approaches reveal differential responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Oryza sativa, a model plant for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, has both host and non-host roots. Large lateral (LLR) and fine lateral (FLR) roots display opposite responses: LLR support AM colonization, but FLR do not. Our research aimed to study the molecular, morphological and physiological aspects related to the non-host behavior of FLR. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LLR and FLR displayed divergent expression profiles, including changes in many metabolic pathways. Compared with LLR, FLR showed down-regulation of genes instrumental for AM establishment and gibberellin signaling, and a higher expression of nutrient transporters. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, FLR had higher phosphorus content. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated that, surprisingly, in the Selenio cultivar, FLR have a two-layered cortex, which is theoretically compatible with AM colonization. According to RNA-seq, a gibberellin inhibitor treatment increased anticlinal divisions leading to a higher number of cortex cells in FLR. We propose that some of the differentially regulated genes that lead to the anatomical and physiological properties of the two root types also function as genetic factors regulating fungal colonization. The rice root apparatus offers a unique tool to study AM symbiosis, allowing direct comparisons of host and non-host roots in the same individual plant.
26300893	Functional characterization and expression analysis of rice δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase provide new insight into the regulation of proline and arginine catabolism.	2015	Front Plant Sci	While intracellular proline accumulation in response to various stress conditions has been investigated in great detail, the biochemistry and physiological relevance of proline degradation in plants is much less understood. Moreover, the second and last step in proline catabolism, the oxidation of δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) to glutamate, is shared with arginine catabolism. Little information is available to date concerning the regulatory mechanisms coordinating these two pathways. Expression of the gene coding for P5C dehydrogenase was analyzed in rice by real-time PCR either following the exogenous supply of amino acids of the glutamate family, or under hyperosmotic stress conditions. The rice enzyme was heterologously expressed in E. coli, and the affinity-purified protein was thoroughly characterized with respect to structural and functional properties. A tetrameric oligomerization state was observed in size exclusion chromatography, which suggests a structure of the plant enzyme different from that shown for the bacterial P5C dehydrogenases structurally characterized to date. Kinetic analysis accounted for a preferential use of NAD(+) as the electron acceptor. Cations were found to modulate enzyme activity, whereas anion effects were negligible. Several metal ions were inhibitory in the micromolar range. Interestingly, arginine also inhibited the enzyme at higher concentrations, with a mechanism of uncompetitive type with respect to P5C. This implies that millimolar levels of arginine would increase the affinity of P5C dehydrogenase toward its specific substrate. Results are discussed in view of the involvement of the enzyme in either proline or arginine catabolism.
26305329	Time-Course RNA-Seq Analysis Reveals Transcriptional Changes in Rice Plants Triggered by Rice stripe virus Infection.	2015	PLoS One	Rice stripe virus (RSV) has become a major pathogen of rice. To determine how the rice transcriptome is modified in response to RSV infection, we used RNA-Seq to perform a genome-wide gene expression analysis of a susceptible rice cultivar. The transcriptomes of RSV-infected samples were compared to those of mock-treated samples at 3, 7, and 15 days post-infection (dpi). From 8 to 11% of the genes were differentially expressed (>2-fold difference in expression) in RSV-infected vs. noninfected rice. Among them, 532 genes were differentially expressed at all three time points. Surprisingly, 37.6% of the 532 genes are related to transposons. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many chloroplast genes were down-regulated in infected plants at 3 and 15 dpi. Expression of genes associated with cell differentiation and flowering was significantly down-regulated in infected plants at 15 dpi. In contrast, most of the up-regulated genes in infected plants concern the cell wall, plasma membrane, and vacuole and are known to function in various metabolic pathways and stress responses. In addition, transcripts of diverse transcription factors gradually accumulated in infected plants with increasing infection time. We also confirmed that the expression of gene subsets (including NBS-LRR domain-containing genes, receptor-like kinase genes, and genes involving RNA silencing) was changed by RSV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and flowering was strongly associated with disease symptoms caused by RSV and that up-regulation of genes involved in metabolic pathways, stress responses, and transcription was related to host defense mechanisms.
26277389	Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Acetylcholine (ACh), a known neurotransmitter in animals and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) exists widely in plants, although its role in plant signal transduction is unclear. We previously reported AChE in Zea mays L. might be related to gravitropism based on pharmacological study using an AChE inhibitor. Here we clearly demonstrate plant AChE play an important role as a positive regulator in the gravity response of plants based on a genetic study. First, the gene encoding a second component of the ACh-mediated signal transduction system, AChE was cloned from rice, Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. The rice AChE shared high homology with maize, siratro and Salicornia AChEs. Similar to animal and other plant AChEs, the rice AChE hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine and propionylthiocholine, but not butyrylthiocholine. Thus, the rice AChE might be characterized as an AChE (E.C.3.1.1.7). Similar to maize and siratro AChEs, the rice AChE exhibited low sensitivity to the AChE inhibitor, neostigmine bromide, compared with the electric eel AChE. Next, the functionality of rice AChE was proved by overexpression in rice plants. The rice AChE was localized in extracellular spaces of rice plants. Further, the rice AChE mRNA and its activity were mainly detected during early developmental stages (2 d-10 d after sowing). Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response. This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice AChE relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings.
26305923	Dysfunction of Rice Mitochondrial Membrane Induced by Yb3+.	2015	J Membr Biol	Ytterbium (Yb), a widely used rare earth element, is treated as highly toxic to human being and adverseness to plant. Mitochondria play a significant role in plant growth and development, and are proposed as a potential target for ytterbium toxicity. In this paper, the biological effect of Yb(3+) on isolated rice mitochondria was investigated. We found that Yb(3+) with high concentrations (200 ~ 600 μM) not only induced mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (mtMPT), but also disturbed the mitochondrial ultrastructure. Moreover, Yb(3+) caused the respiratory chain damage, ROS formation, membrane potential decrease, and mitochondrial complex II activity reverse. The results above suggested that Yb(3+) with high concentrations could induce mitochondrial membrane dysfunction. These findings will support some valuable information to the safe application of Yb-based agents.
26237574	Evolution of structural and functional diversification among plant Argonautes.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Argonautes (AGOs) are the effector proteins of the RNA-induced silencing (RISC) complex, formed during the phenomena of small-RNA mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing. AGOs are a large family of proteins; their number varies from a few (4 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) to many (18 in Oryza sativa) in plants. Genetics-guided analysis have demonstrated the roles of some of the AGOs during growth and development of plants. Biochemical studies have further revealed differences in functional specificities among AGOs. How the AGO family expanded in different plant species during the course of evolution is starting to emerge. We hypothesized that 4 classes of AGOs evolved after divergence of unicellular green algae when an ancestral AGO underwent duplication events. Evolution of multicellularity may have coincided with the diversification of AGOs. A comparative sequence and structure analysis of the plant AGOs, including those from the mosses and the unicellular algae, show not only conformational differences between those from lower and higher plants, but also functional divergence of important sites.
26264916	Expression and characterization of manganese lipoxygenase of the rice blast fungus reveals prominent sequential lipoxygenation of α-linolenic acid.	2015	Arch Biochem Biophys	Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast disease and has become a model organism of fungal infections. M. oryzae can oxygenate fatty acids by 7,8-linoleate diol synthase, 10R-dioxygenase-epoxy alcohol synthase, and by a putative manganese lipoxygenase (Mo-MnLOX). The latter two are transcribed during infection. The open reading frame of Mo-MnLOX was deduced from genome and cDNA analysis. Recombinant Mo-MnLOX was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme contained protein-bound Mn and oxidized 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 to 9S-, 11-, and 13R-hydroperoxy metabolites by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. The 11-hydroperoxides were subject to β-fragmentation with formation of 9S- and 13R-hydroperoxy fatty acids. Oxygen consumption indicated apparent kcat values of 2.8 s(-1) (18:2n-6) and 3.9 s(-1) (18:3n-3), and UV analysis yielded apparent Km values of 8 and 12 μM, respectively, for biosynthesis of cis-trans conjugated metabolites. 9S-Hydroperoxy-10E,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid was rapidly further oxidized to a triene, 9S,16S-dihydroperoxy-10E,12Z,14E-octadecatrienoic acid. In conclusion, we have expressed, purified and characterized a new MnLOX from M. oryzae. The pathogen likely secretes Mo-MnLOX and phospholipases to generate oxylipins and to oxidize lipid membranes of rice cells and the cuticle.
26083154	MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in the response of rice plants to fungal elicitors.	2015	RNA Biol	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have important regulatory functions in plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stress. Increasing evidence also supports that plant miRNAs contribute to immune responses to pathogens. Here, we used deep sequencing of small RNA libraries for global identification of rice miRNAs that are regulated by fungal elicitors. We also describe 9 previously uncharacterized miRNAs in rice. Combined small RNA and degradome analyses revealed regulatory networks enriched in elicitor-regulated miRNAs supported by the identification of their corresponding target genes. Specifically, we identified an important number of miRNA/target gene pairs involved in small RNA pathways, including miRNA, heterochromatic and trans-acting siRNA pathways. We present evidence for miRNA/target gene pairs implicated in hormone signaling and cross-talk among hormone pathways having great potential in regulating rice immunity. Furthermore, we describe miRNA-mediated regulation of Conserved-Peptide upstream Open Reading Frame (CPuORF)-containing genes in rice, which suggests the existence of a novel regulatory network that integrates miRNA and CPuORF functions in plants. The knowledge gained in this study will help in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in rice immunity and develop appropriate strategies for rice protection.
26248689	A genome-wide survey reveals abundant rice blast R genes in resistant cultivars.	2015	Plant J	Plant resistance genes (R genes) harbor tremendous allelic diversity, constituting a robust immune system effective against microbial pathogens. Nevertheless, few functional R genes have been identified for even the best-studied pathosystems. Does this limited repertoire reflect specificity, with most R genes having been defeated by former pests, or do plants harbor a rich diversity of functional R genes, the composite behavior of which is yet to be characterized? Here, we survey 332 NBS-LRR genes cloned from five resistant Oryza sativa (rice) cultivars for their ability to confer recognition of 12 rice blast isolates when transformed into susceptible cultivars. Our survey reveals that 48.5% of the 132 NBS-LRR loci tested contain functional rice blast R genes, with most R genes deriving from multi-copy clades containing especially diversified loci. Each R gene recognized, on average, 2.42 of the 12 isolates screened. The abundant R genes identified in resistant genomes provide extraordinary redundancy in the ability of host genotypes to recognize particular isolates. If the same is true for other pathogens, many extant NBS-LRR genes retain functionality. Our success at identifying rice blast R genes also validates a highly efficient cloning and screening strategy.
26331804	Predominance of 2-hydroxymelatonin over melatonin in plants.	2015	J Pineal Res	The cloning of the gene encoding melatonin 2-hydroxylase (M2H), which is responsible for the synthesis of 2-hydroxymelatonin, has expanded the study of melatonin metabolism in plants. Kinetic analysis of M2H enzymatic activity demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of M2H is much higher than those of other melatonin biosynthetic enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) and N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), suggesting that melatonin metabolism is rapid in plants. To test this prediction, we selected 24 plant species belonging to 16 families and quantified the levels of melatonin and 2-hydroxymelatonin using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The melatonin levels in most of the species were <1 ng/g fresh weight (FW), while those in leaves from radish and feverfew were 3.5 and 3.3 ng/g FW, respectively. In contrast, the average levels of 2-hydroxymelatonin were much higher at 6.2 ng/g FW. The average ratio of 2-hydroxymelatonin to melatonin in plants was approximately 368:1, indicating that the accumulation of 2-hydroxymelatonin predominates over that of melatonin. These data were consistent with previous results on the kinetics of the corresponding enzymes, as well as with in vivo melatonin conversion data. Among several melatonin metabolites in plants, the most abundant metabolite was found to be 2-hydroxymelatonin (99%) followed by 4-hydroxymelatonin (0.05%), but 6-hydroxymelatonin was not detected in rice seedlings.
26272249	The SnRK2-APC/C(TE) regulatory module mediates the antagonistic action of gibberellic acid and abscisic acid pathways.	2015	Nat Commun	Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) antagonistically regulate many developmental processes and responses to biotic or abiotic stresses in higher plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this antagonism is still poorly understood. Here, we show that loss-of-function mutation in rice Tiller Enhancer (TE), an activator of the APC/C(TE) complex, causes hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity to ABA and GA, respectively. We find that TE physically interacts with ABA receptor OsPYL/RCARs and promotes their degradation by the proteasome. Genetic analysis also shows OsPYL/RCARs act downstream of TE in mediating ABA responses. Conversely, ABA inhibits APC/C(TE) activity by phosphorylating TE through activating the SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK2s), which may interrupt the interaction between TE and OsPYL/RCARs and subsequently stabilize OsPYL/RCARs. In contrast, GA can reduce the level of SnRK2s and may promote APC/C(TE)-mediated degradation of OsPYL/RCARs. Thus, we propose that the SnRK2-APC/C(TE) regulatory module represents a regulatory hub underlying the antagonistic action of GA and ABA in plants.
26275148	SHOEBOX Modulates Root Meristem Size in Rice through Dose-Dependent Effects of Gibberellins on Cell Elongation and Proliferation.	2015	PLoS Genet	Little is known about how the size of meristem cells is regulated and whether it participates in the control of meristem size in plants. Here, we report our findings on shoebox (shb), a mild gibberellin (GA) deficient rice mutant that has a short root meristem size. Quantitative analysis of cortical cell length and number indicates that shb has shorter, rather than fewer, cells in the root meristem until around the fifth day after sowing, from which the number of cortical cells is also reduced. These defects can be either corrected by exogenous application of bioactive GA or induced in wild-type roots by a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of paclobutrazol on GA biosynthesis, suggesting that GA deficiency is the primary cause of shb mutant phenotypes. SHB encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor that directly activates transcription of the GA biosynthesis gene KS1. Thus, root meristem size in rice is modulated by SHB-mediated GA biosynthesis that regulates the elongation and proliferation of meristem cells in a developmental stage-specific manner.
24268791	Fine characterization of OsPHO2 knockout mutants reveals its key role in Pi utilization in rice.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Previous research using forward genetics approaches demonstrated that OsPHO2 regulates multiple phosphate-starvation responses in rice. In this work, we finely characterized two independent OsPHO2 knockout rice mutants under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-sufficient conditions. The ospho2 mutants exhibited defects in growth and reproductive development in the whole growing period. The cells in the elongation zone of ospho2 seedling roots were much shorter than those of the wild type. The phosphorus concentration in the blades of ospho2 mutants was 5.8-fold higher than those of wild-type plants, whereas it was only slightly higher in the sheaths, culms, spikelets, and seeds. Furthermore, Pi levels in the ospho2 mutants were highest in the oldest leaf and lowest in the youngest leaf, whereas there was no significant difference in the corresponding leaves of wild-type plants. These results suggest that ospho2 mutant phenotype results from a partial defect in Pi translocation and remobilization in the shoot of rice. This study thus provides evidence that OsPHO2, which functions at the downstream of OsPHF1, modulates Pi utilization by regulating the expression of Pht1 transporters in rice.
19841664	A large family of genes that share homology with CLE domain in Arabidopsis and rice.	2008	Plant Signal Behav	Thirty-one CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-related (CLE) proteins are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome, and they are supposed to function as dodecapeptides with two hydroxyproline residues. Twenty-six synthetic CLE peptides, corresponding to the predicted products of the 31 CLE genes, were examined in Arabidopsis and rice. Nineteen CLE peptides induced root meristem consumption, resulting in the short root phenotype in Arabidopsis and rice, whereas no CLE peptides affected the shoot apical meristem in rice. Database searches revealed 47 putative CLE genes in the rice genome. Three of the rice CLE genes, OsCLE502, OsCLE504 and OsCLE506, encode CLE proteins with multiple CLE domains, which are not found in the Arabidopsis genome, and polyproline region was found between these CLE domains. These results indicate conserved and/or diverse CLE functions in each plant species.
23534212	Comparative proteomic study and functional analysis of translationally controlled tumor protein in rice roots under Hg2+ stress.	2012	J Environ Sci (China)	So far, very little is known about mercury stress-induced intercellular metabolic changes in rice roots at the proteome level. To investigate the response of rice roots to mercury stress, changes in protein expression in rice roots were analyzed using a comparative proteomics approach. Six-leaf stage rice seedlings were treated with 50 micromol/L HgCl2 for 3 hr; 29 protein spots showed a significant changes in abundance under stress when compared with the Hg2+ -tolerant rice mutant and wild type (Zhonghua 11). Furthermore, all these protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry to match 27 diverse protein species. The identified proteins were involved in several processes, including stress response, redox homeostasis, signal transduction, regulation and metabolism; some were found to be cellular structure proteins and a few were unknown. Among the up-regulated proteins, OsTCTP (translationally controlled tumor protein) was chosen to perform hetereologous expression in yeast which was presumed to participate in the Hg2+ tolerance of rice, providing evidence for its role in alleviating Hg2+ damage. Among the many tests, we found that OsTCTP-overexpressed yeast strains were more resistant to Hg2+ than wild-type yeast. Thus, we propose that OsTCTP contributes to Hg2+ resistance. Here we present, for the first time, the functional characterization of OsTCTP in connection with Hg2+ stress in plants.
25120549	Structural divergence of plant TCTPs.	2014	Front Plant Sci	The Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved protein at the level of sequence, considered to play an essential role in the regulation of growth and development in eukaryotes. However, this function has been inferred from studies in a few model systems, such as mice and mammalian cell lines, Drosophila and Arabidopsis. Thus, the knowledge regarding this protein is far from complete. In the present study bioinformatic analysis showed the presence of one or more TCTP genes per genome in plants with highly conserved signatures and subtle variations at the level of primary structure but with more noticeable differences at the level of predicted three-dimensional structures. These structures show differences in the "pocket" region close to the center of the protein and in its flexible loop domain. In fact, all predictive TCTP structures can be divided into two groups: (1) AtTCTP1-like and (2) CmTCTP-like, based on the predicted structures of an Arabidopsis TCTP and a Cucurbita maxima TCTP; according to this classification we propose that their probable function in plants may be inferred in principle. Thus, different TCTP genes in a single organism may have different functions; additionally, in those species harboring a single TCTP gene this could carry multiple functions. On the other hand, in silico analysis of AtTCTP1-like and CmTCTP-like promoters suggest that these share common motifs but with different abundance, which may underscore differences in their gene expression patterns. Finally, the absence of TCTP genes in most chlorophytes with the exception of Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, indicates that other proteins perform the roles played by TCTP or the pathways regulated by TCTP occur through alternative routes. These findings provide insight into the evolution of this gene family in plants.
25103875	Identification and functional assay of the interaction motifs in the partner protein OsNAR2.1 of the two-component system for high-affinity nitrate transport.	2014	New Phytol	A partner protein, NAR2, is essential for high-affinity nitrate transport of the NRT2 protein in plants. However, the NAR2 motifs that interact with NRT2s for their plasma membrane (PM) localization and nitrate transporter activity have not been functionally characterized. In this study, OsNAR2.1 mutations with different carbon (C)-terminal deletions and nine different point mutations in the conserved regions of NAR2 homologs in plants were generated to explore the essential motifs involved in the interaction with OsNRT2.3a. Screening using the membrane yeast two-hybrid system and Xenopus oocytes for nitrogen-15 ((15)N) uptake demonstrated that either R100G or D109N point mutations impaired the OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNRT2.3a. Western blotting and visualization using green fluorescent protein fused to either the N- or C-terminus of OsNAR2.1 indicated that OsNAR2.1 is expressed in both the PM and cytoplasm. The split-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/BiFC analyses indicated that OsNRT2.3a was targeted to the PM in the presence of OsNAR2.1, while either R100G or D109N mutation resulted in the loss of OsNRT2.3a-YFP signal in the PM. Based on these results, arginine 100 and aspartic acid 109 of the OsNAR2.1 protein are key amino acids in the interaction with OsNRT2.3a, and their interaction occurs in the PM but not cytoplasm.
19752888	A transcription factor with a bHLH domain regulates root hair development in rice.	2009	Cell Res	
23550829	The unconventional P-loop NTPase OsYchF1 and its regulator OsGAP1 play opposite roles in salinity stress tolerance.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	YchF proteins are a group of mysterious but ubiquitous unconventional G-proteins found in all kingdoms of life except Archaea. Their functions have been documented in microorganisms, protozoa and human, but those of plant YchF homologues are largely unknown. Our group has previously shown that OsYchF1 and its interacting protein, OsGAP1, play opposite roles in plant defense responses. OsGAP1 was found to stimulate the GTPase/ATPase activities of OsYchF1 and regulate its subcellular localization. In this report, we demonstrate that both OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are localized mainly in the cytosol under NaCl treatment. The ectopic expression of OsYchF1 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana leads to reduced tolerance towards salinity stress, while the ectopic expression of OsGAP1 has the opposite effect. Similar results were also obtained with the Arabidopsis homologues, AtYchF1 and AtGAP1, by using AtGAP1 overexpressors and underexpressors, as well as an AtYchF1-knockdown mutant. OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 also exhibit highly significant effects on salinity-induced oxidative stress tolerance. The expression of OsYchF1 suppresses the anti-oxidation enzymatic activities and increases lipid peroxidation in transgenic Arabidopsis, and leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tobacco BY-2 cells, while the ectopic expression of OsGAP1 has the opposite effects in these two model systems.
21737415	Role of DREBs in regulation of abiotic stress responses in plants.	2011	J Exp Bot	Abiotic stresses such as drought, high salinity, and cold are common adverse environmental conditions that significantly influence plant growth and productivity worldwide. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in physiological and developmental responses as well as in co-ordinating various stress signal transduction pathways in plants. DREBs (dehydration responsive element binding) are important plant transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the expression of many stress-inducible genes mostly in an ABA-independent manner and play a critical role in improving the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by interacting with a DRE/CRT cis-element present in the promoter region of various abiotic stress-responsive genes. This review summarizes recent studies highlighting the role of the DRE-binding family of TFs in the adaptive responses to different abiotic stresses and their structural and functional characters with emphasis on the expression and regulation of DREBs. The practical and application value of DREBs in crop improvement, such as stress tolerance engineering as well as marker-assisted selection (MAS), has also been discussed.
12844217	An AP2/EREBP-type transcription-factor gene from rice is cold-inducible and encodes a nuclear-localized protein.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	We cloned an AP2/EREBP gene by dot blotting and named it OsDREBL. Analysis of its deduced amino-acid sequence indicated that this protein had a potential nuclear-localization signal, a possible acidic-activation domain and an AP2 DNA binding domain. Northern analysis showed that the transcripts of OsDREBL accumulated rapidly (within 30 min) in response to low temperature, but not in response to ABA, NaCl and dehydration treatments. Southern analysis indicated the presence of a single-copy of the OsDREBL gene in the Oryza sativa genome. Our research also demonstrated that OsDREBL was localized to the nucleus but did not bind effectively to the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element (CRT/DRE). These results suggested that OsDREBL may function as a transcription factor in the cold-stress response, independent of the DREB signal-transduction pathway.
21151904	Dichotomy in the NRT gene families of dicots and grass species.	2010	PLoS One	A large proportion of the nitrate (NO(3)(-)) acquired by plants from soil is actively transported via members of the NRT families of NO(3)(-) transporters. In Arabidopsis, the NRT1 family has eight functionally characterised members and predominantly comprises low-affinity transporters; the NRT2 family contains seven members which appear to be high-affinity transporters; and there are two NRT3 (NAR2) family members which are known to participate in high-affinity transport. A modified reciprocal best hit (RBH) approach was used to identify putative orthologues of the Arabidopsis NRT genes in the four fully sequenced grass genomes (maize, rice, sorghum, Brachypodium). We also included the poplar genome in our analysis to establish whether differences between Arabidopsis and the grasses may be generally applicable to monocots and dicots. Our analysis reveals fundamental differences between Arabidopsis and the grass species in the gene number and family structure of all three families of NRT transporters. All grass species possessed additional NRT1.1 orthologues and appear to lack NRT1.6/NRT1.7 orthologues. There is significant separation in the NRT2 phylogenetic tree between NRT2 genes from dicots and grass species. This indicates that determination of function of NRT2 genes in grass species will not be possible in cereals based simply on sequence homology to functionally characterised Arabidopsis NRT2 genes and that proper functional analysis will be required. Arabidopsis has a unique NRT3.2 gene which may be a fusion of the NRT3.1 and NRT3.2 genes present in all other species examined here. This work provides a framework for future analysis of NO(3)(-) transporters and NO(3)(-) transport in grass crop species.
18424615	Arabidopsis SCARs function interchangeably to meet actin-related protein 2/3 activation thresholds during morphogenesis.	2008	Plant Cell	During polarized growth and tissue morphogenesis, cells must reorganize their cytoplasm and change shape in response to growth signals. Dynamic polymerization of actin filaments is one cellular component of polarized growth, and the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex is an important actin filament nucleator in plants. ARP2/3 alone is inactive, and the Arabidopsis thaliana WAVE complex translates Rho-family small GTPase signals into an ARP2/3 activation response. The SCAR subunit of the WAVE complex is the primary activator of ARP2/3, and plant and vertebrate SCARs are encoded by a small gene family. However, it is unclear if SCAR isoforms function interchangeably or if they have unique properties that customize WAVE complex functions. We used the Arabidopsis distorted group mutants and an integrated analysis of SCAR gene and protein functions to address this question directly. Genetic results indicate that each of the four SCARs functions in the context of the WAVE-ARP2/3 pathway and together they define the lone mechanism for ARP2/3 activation. Genetic interactions among the scar mutants and transgene complementation studies show that the activators function interchangeably to meet the threshold for ARP2/3 activation in the cell. Interestingly, double, triple, and quadruple mutant analyses indicate that individual SCAR genes vary in their relative importance depending on the cell type, tissue, or organ that is analyzed. Differences among SCARs in mRNA levels and the biochemical efficiency of ARP2/3 activation may explain the functional contributions of individual genes.
25400654	The rice enhancer of zeste [E(z)] genes SDG711 and SDG718 are respectively involved in long day and short day signaling to mediate the accurate photoperiod control of flowering time.	2014	Front Plant Sci	Recent advances in rice flowering studies have shown that the accurate control of flowering by photoperiod is regulated by key mechanisms that involve the regulation of flowering genes including Heading date1 (Hd1), Early hd1 (Ehd1), Hd3a, and RFT1. The chromatin mechanism involved in the regulation of rice flowering genes is presently not well known. Here we show that the rice enhancer of zeste [E(z)] genes SDG711 and SDG718, which encode the polycomb repressive complex2 (PRC2) key subunit that is required for trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), are respectively, involved in long day (LD) and short day (SD) regulation of key flowering genes. The expression of SDG711 and SDG718 is induced by LD and SD, respectively. Over-expression and down-regulation of SDG711 respectively, repressed and promoted flowering in LD, but had no effect in SD. By contrast, down-regulation of SDG718 had no effect in LD but delayed flowering in SD. SDG711 and SDG718 repressed OsLF (a repressor of Hd1) respectively in LD and SD, leading to a higher expression of Hd1 thus late flowering in LD and early flowering in SD. SDG711 was also found to be involved in the repression of Ehd1 in LD. SDG711 was shown to directly target to OsLF and Ehd1 loci to mediate H3K27me3 and gene repression. The function of the rice E(z) genes in LD repression and SD promotion of flowering suggests that PRC2-mediated epigenetic repression of gene expression is involved in the accurate photoperiod control of rice flowering.
21362738	Microarray-based analysis of cadmium-responsive microRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	J Exp Bot	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate specific target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. Plant miRNAs have been implicated in developmental processes and adaptations to environmental stresses. Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential heavy metal that is highly toxic to plants. To investigate the responsive functions of miRNAs under Cd stress, miRNA expression in Cd-stressed rice (Oryza sativa) was profiled using a microarray assay. A total of 19 Cd-responsive miRNAs were identified, of which six were further validated experimentally. Target genes were also predicted for these Cd-responsive miRNAs, which encoded transcription factors, and proteins associated with metabolic processes or stress responses. In addition, the mRNA levels of several targets were negatively correlated with the corresponding miRNAs under Cd stress. Promoter analysis showed that metal stress-responsive cis-elements tended to occur more frequently in the promoter regions of Cd-responsive miRNAs. These findings suggested that miRNAs played an important role in Cd tolerance in rice, and highlighted a novel molecular mechanism of heavy metal tolerance in plants.
12136031	Dasheng: a recently amplified nonautonomous long terminal repeat element that is a major component of pericentromeric regions in rice.	2002	Genetics	A new and unusual family of LTR elements, Dasheng, has been discovered in the genome of Oryza sativa following database searches of approximately 100 Mb of rice genomic sequence and 78 Mb of BAC-end sequence information. With all of the cis-elements but none of the coding domains normally associated with retrotransposons (e.g., gag, pol), Dasheng is a novel nonautonomous LTR element with high copy number. Over half of the approximately 1000 Dasheng elements in the rice genome are full length (5.6-8.6 kb), and 60% are estimated to have amplified in the past 500,000 years. Using a modified AFLP technique called transposon display, 215 elements were mapped to all 12 rice chromosomes. Interestingly, more than half of the mapped elements are clustered in the heterochromatic regions around centromeres. The distribution pattern was further confirmed by FISH analysis. Despite clustering in heterochromatin, Dasheng elements are not nested, suggesting their potential value as molecular markers for these marker-poor regions. Taken together, Dasheng is one of the highest-copy-number LTR elements and one of the most recent elements to amplify in the rice genome.
16895613	Cross genome comparisons of serine proteases in Arabidopsis and rice.	2006	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Serine proteases are one of the largest groups of proteolytic enzymes found across all kingdoms of life and are associated with several essential physiological pathways. The availability of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequences has permitted the identification and comparison of the repertoire of serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species.

RESULTS: Despite the differences in genome sizes between Arabidopsis and rice, we identified a very similar number of serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species (206 and 222, respectively). Nearly 40% of the above sequences were identified as potential orthologues. Atypical members could be identified in the plant genomes for Deg, Clp, Lon, rhomboid proteases and species-specific members were observed for the highly populated subtilisin and serine carboxypeptidase families suggesting multiple lateral gene transfers. DegP proteases, prolyl oligopeptidases, Clp proteases and rhomboids share a significantly higher percentage orthology between the two genomes indicating substantial evolutionary divergence was set prior to speciation. Single domain architectures and paralogues for several putative subtilisins, serine carboxypeptidases and rhomboids suggest they may have been recruited for additional roles in secondary metabolism with spatial and temporal regulation. The analysis reveals some domain architectures unique to either or both of the plant species and some inactive proteases, like in rhomboids and Clp proteases, which could be involved in chaperone function.

CONCLUSION: The systematic analysis of the serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species has provided some insight into the possible functional associations of previously uncharacterised serine protease-like proteins. Further investigation of these aspects may prove beneficial in our understanding of similar processes in commercially significant crop plant species.
17145706	The TIGR Rice Genome Annotation Resource: improvements and new features.	2007	Nucleic Acids Res	In The Institute for Genomic Research Rice Genome Annotation project (http://rice.tigr.org), we have continued to update the rice genome sequence with new data and improve the quality of the annotation. In our current release of annotation (Release 4.0; January 12, 2006), we have identified 42,653 non-transposable element-related genes encoding 49,472 gene models as a result of the detection of alternative splicing. We have refined our identification methods for transposable element-related genes resulting in 13,237 genes that are related to transposable elements. Through incorporation of multiple transcript and proteomic expression data sets, we have been able to annotate 24 799 genes (31,739 gene models), representing approximately 50% of the total gene models, as expressed in the rice genome. All structural and functional annotation is viewable through our Rice Genome Browser which currently supports 59 tracks. Enhanced data access is available through web interfaces, FTP downloads and a Data Extractor tool developed in order to support discrete dataset downloads.
15914931	Involvement of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor RERJ1 in wounding and drought stress responses in rice plants.	2005	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene RERJ1 isolated from suspension-cultured rice cells encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. In this study, we found that RERJ1 is also expressed in rice plants in response to JA, and that its expression in rice leaves is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress. It is also suggested that JA but not abscisic acid is involved in the up-regulation of RERJ1 expression caused by wounding and drought stress.
15806324	Interaction between proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a DnaJ induced by DNA damage.	2005	J Plant Res	Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential protein for both DNA replication and DNA repair. In the present study using two-hybrid analysis with PCNA from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsPCNA), we found that OsPCNA interacted with rice DnaJ protein. We have identified DnaJ and designated it as OsDnaJ. OsDnaJ was able to bind to OsPCNA in vitro. Transcripts of OsDnaJ were found to be strongly expressed in the proliferating cells. mRNA of DnaJ was induced by UV and DNA-damaging agents such as H2O2. The expression patterns of OsPCNA were almost the same as OsDnaJ. The relationship between OsPCNA and OsDnaJ is discussed.
10939258	Characterizing rice lesion mimic mutants and identifying a mutant with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight.	2000	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Many plant mutants develop spontaneous lesions that resemble disease symptoms in the absence of pathogen attack. In several pathosystems, lesion mimic mutations have been shown to be involved in programmed cell death, which in some instances leads to enhanced disease resistance to multiple pathogens. We investigated the relationship between spontaneous cell death and disease resistance in rice with nine mutants with a range of lesion mimic phenotypes. All nine mutations are controlled by recessive genes and some of these mutants have stunted growth and other abnormal characteristics. The lesion mimics that appeared on the leaves of these mutants were caused by cell death as measured by trypan blue staining. Activation of six defense-related genes was observed in most of the mutants when the mimic lesions developed. Four mutants exhibited significant enhanced resistance to rice blast. One of the mutants, spl11, confers non-race-specific resistance not only to blast but also to bacterial blight. The level of resistance in the spl11 mutant to the two pathogens correlates with the defense-related gene expression and lesion development on the leaves. The results suggest that some lesion mimic mutations in rice may be involved in disease resistance, and cloning of these genes may provide a clue to developing broad-spectrum resistance to diverse pathogens.
11332734	Identification of defense-related rice genes by suppression subtractive hybridization and differential screening.	2001	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Identification of host genes involved in defense responses is one of most critical steps leading to the elucidation of disease resistance mechanisms in plants. In this study, two different cloning strategies were employed to identify defense-related genes from a tropical japonica rice cultivar (Oryza sativa cv. Drew). With the use of bacterial colony arrays, differential screening of a blast fungus (Pyricularia grisea)-induced rice cDNA library led to the isolation of 22 distinct rice genes that are expressed differentially in response to blast infection. Sequence analysis indicates that most of them are full-length cDNAs encoding pathogenesis-related proteins or other relatively abundant proteins. In combination with treatments of cycloheximide plus jasmonic acid (JA) or benzothiadiazole (BTH) in rice seedlings, the polymerase chain reaction-based suppression subtractive hybridization also was conducted to search for immediate early (IE) defense-related genes whose transcription is independent of de novo protein synthesis. The initial screening of only 768 subtracted clones resulted in the identification of 34 distinct IE genes that are induced by JA, BTH, and/or blast infection. Database searches revealed that these IE genes encode putative mitogen-activated protein kinase, diacylglycerol kinase, zinc finger protein, RelA-SpoT protein, ankyrin-containing protein, ABC transporter, beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, and other potential defense-signaling components. Further characterization of these novel IE genes will likely facilitate the elucidation of defense signal transduction in rice plants.
26709535	A Tyrosine Aminomutase from Rice (Oryza sativa) Isomerizes (S)-α- to (R)-β-Tyrosine with Unique High Enantioselectivity and Retention of Configuration.	2016	Biochemistry	A recently discovered 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO)-dependent tyrosine aminomutase (OsTAM) from rice [Yan, J., et al. (2015) Plant Cell 27, 1265] converts (S)-α-tyrosine to a mixture of (R)- and (S)-β-tyrosines, with high (94%) enantiomeric excess, which does not change with pH, like it does for two bacterial TAMs. The K(M) of 490 μM and the k(cat) of 0.005 s(-1) are similar for other TAM enzymes. OsTAM is unique and also catalyzes (R)-β- from (S)-α-phenylalanine. OsTAM principally retains the configuration at the reactive C(α) and C(β) centers during catalysis much like the phenylalanine aminomutase on the Taxol biosynthetic pathway in Taxus plants.
26631749	Coordinated regulation of vegetative and reproductive branching in rice.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Grasses produce tiller and panicle branching at vegetative and reproductive stages; the branching patterns largely define the diversity of grasses and constitute a major determinant for grain yield of many cereals. Here we show that a spatiotemporally coordinated gene network consisting of the MicroRNA 156 (miR156/)miR529/SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) and miR172/APETALA2 (AP2) pathways regulates tiller and panicle branching in rice. SPL genes negatively control tillering, but positively regulate inflorescence meristem and spikelet transition. Underproduction or overproduction of SPLs reduces panicle branching, but by distinct mechanisms: miR156 and miR529 fine-tune the SPL levels for optimal panicle size. miR172 regulates spikelet transition by targeting AP2-like genes, which does not affect tillering, and the AP2-like proteins play the roles by interacting with TOPLESS-related proteins (TPRs). SPLs modulate panicle branching by directly regulating the miR172/AP2 and PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2)/Rice TFL1/CEN homolog 1 (RCN1) pathways and also by integrating other regulators, most of which are not involved in tillering regulation. These findings may also have significant implications for understanding branching regulation of other grasses and for application in rice genetic improvement.
26680197	Rice perception of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi requires the karrikin receptor complex.	2015	Science	In terrestrial ecosystems, plants take up phosphate predominantly via association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We identified loss of responsiveness to AMF in the rice (Oryza sativa) mutant hebiba, reflected by the absence of physical contact and of characteristic transcriptional responses to fungal signals. Among the 26 genes deleted in hebiba, DWARF 14 LIKE is, the one responsible for loss of symbiosis . It encodes an alpha/beta-fold hydrolase, that is a component of an intracellular receptor complex involved in the detection of the smoke compound karrikin. Our finding reveals an unexpected plant recognition strategy for AMF and a previously unknown signaling link between symbiosis and plant development.
26663563	OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	The WRKY transcription factor family has 109 members in the rice genome, and has been reported to be involved in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress in plants. Here, we demonstrated that a rice OsWRKY74 belonging to group III of the WRKY transcription factor family was involved in tolerance to phosphate (Pi) starvation. OsWRKY74 was localized in the nucleus and mainly expressed in roots and leaves. Overexpression of OsWRKY74 significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, whereas transgenic lines with down-regulation of OsWRKY74 were sensitive to Pi starvation. Root and shoot biomass, and phosphorus (P) concentration in rice OsWRKY74-overexpressing plants were ~16% higher than those of wild-type (WT) plants in Pi-deficient hydroponic solution. In soil pot experiments, >24% increases in tiller number, grain weight and P concentration were observed in rice OsWRKY74-overexpressing plants compared to WT plants when grown in P-deficient medium. Furthermore, Pi starvation-induced changes in root system architecture were more profound in OsWRKY74-overexpressing plants than in WT plants. Expression patterns of a number of Pi-responsive genes were altered in the OsWRKY74-overexpressing and RNA interference lines. In addition, OsWRKY74 may also be involved in the response to deficiencies in iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) as well as cold stress in rice. In Pi-deficient conditions, OsWRKY74-overexpressing plants exhibited greater accumulation of Fe and up-regulation of the cold-responsive genes than WT plants. These findings highlight the role of OsWRKY74 in modulation of Pi homeostasis and potential crosstalk between P starvation and Fe starvation, and cold stress in rice.
26681628	A consortium of rhizobacterial strains and biochemical growth elicitors improve cold and drought stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	In the present study, a consortium of two rhizobacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Bk7 and Brevibacillus laterosporus B4, termed 'BB', biochemical elicitors salicylic acid and β-aminobutyric acid (SB) and their mixture (BBSB) were investigated for cold and drought stress tolerance in rice plants. After withholding water for 16 days, rice plants treated with BBSB showed 100% survival, improved seedling height (35.4 cm), shoot number (6.12), and showed minimum symptoms of chlorosis (19%), wilting (4%), necrosis (6%) and rolling of leaves. Similarly, BB inoculation enhanced plant growth and reduced overall symptoms in rice seedlings subjected to 0 ± 5 °C for 24 h. Our results imply several mechanisms underlying BB- and BBSB-elicited stress tolerance. In contrast to the control, both treatments significantly decreased leaf monodehydroascorbate (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage, and increased leaf proline and cholorophyll content. Moreover, activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) increased 3.0- and 3.6-fold, respectively. Moreover, expression of OsMYB3R-2, OsDIL, OsDREB1A and OsCDPK13 genes was significantly up-regulated, suggesting that these genes play important roles in abiotic stress tolerance of rice. In addition, bacterial strains Bk7 and B4 were able to produce high amounts of IAA and siderophores, and colonise the plant roots, while only strain Bk7 exhibited the capability to form biofilms and solubilise inorganic phosphate. This study indicates that the BB and BBSB bio-formulations can be used to confer induced systematic tolerance and improve the health of rice plants subject to chilling and drought stress.
26634536	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the VDAC gene family in rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as a mitochondrial porin, plays an important role in the regulation of metabolic and energetic functions of mitochondria, as well as in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is of major economic importance for commercial hybrid production and a research model for the interaction be-tween nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes. Recent research has revealed that CMS is associated with programmed cell death. Here, we used the Honglian (HL)-CMS line of rice (Oryza sativa) as material to investigate the association of O. sativa VDAC (OsVDAC) expression to CMS. Eight VDACs were extracted from rice in this study. Bioinformatic analysis of the rice VDACs was conducted at the DNA, cDNA, and protein level. Expression patterns of OsVDACs were analyzed in different organs and during different stages of pollen development using sterile line YuetaiA (YTA), and its maintainer line YuetaiB (YTB). Differential expression of OsVDACs between YTA and YTB was observed, suggesting that VDACs may be involved in the formation of HL-CMS.
26679011	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) represent a large family of proteins in plants. However, few RLCKs have been well characterized. Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs - OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118 and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII. These OsRLCKs interact with the rice brassinosteroid receptor, OsBRI1 in yeast cell, but not the XA21 immune receptor. Transgenic lines silenced for each of these genes have enlarged leaf angles and are hypersensitive to brassinolide treatment compared to wild type rice. Transgenic plants silenced for OsRLCK57 had significantly fewer tillers and reduced panicle secondary branching, and lines silenced for OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 produce fewer seeds. Silencing of these genes decreased Xa21 gene expression and compromised XA21-mediated immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Our study demonstrates that these OsRLCKs negatively regulate BR signalling, while positively regulating immune responses by contributing to the expression of the immune receptor XA21.
26666551	Ectopic expression of PgRab7 in rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) results in differential tolerance at the vegetative and seed setting stage during salinity and drought stress.	2017	Protoplasma	In this work, we have overexpressed a vesicle trafficking protein, Rab7, from a stress-tolerant plant, Pennisetum glaucum, in a high-yielding but stress-sensitive rice variety Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1). The transgenic rice plants were tested for tolerance against salinity and drought stress. The transgenic plants showed considerable tolerance at the vegetative stage against both salinity (200 mM NaCl) and drought stress (up to 12 days after withdrawing water). The protection against salt and drought stress may be by regulating Na+ ion homeostasis, as the transgenic plants showed altered expression of multiple transporter genes, including OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsSOS1, OsVHA, and OsGLRs. In addition, decreased generation and maintenance of lesser reactive oxygen species (ROS), with maintenance of chloroplast grana and photosynthetic machinery was observed. When evaluated for reproductive growth, 89-96 % of seed setting was maintained in transgenic plants during drought stress; however, under salt stress, a 33-53 % decrease in seed setting was observed. These results indicate that PgRab7 overexpression in rice confers differential tolerance at the seed setting stage during salinity and drought stress and could be a favored target for raising drought-tolerant crops.
26699939	AtTMEM18 plays important roles in pollen tube and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	In flowering plants, pollen tube growth is essential for delivery of male gametes into the female gametophyte or embryo sac for double fertilization. Although many genes have been identified as being involved in the process, the molecular mechanisms of pollen tube growth remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified that the Arabidopsis Transmembrane Protein 18 (AtTMEM18) gene played important roles in pollen tube growth. The AtTMEM18 shares a high similarity with the Transmembrane 18 proteins (TMEM18s) that are conserved in most eukaryotes and may play important roles in obesity in humans. Mutation in the AtTMEM18 by a Ds insertion caused abnormal callose deposition in the pollen grains and had a significant impact on pollen germination and pollen tube growth. AtTMEM18 is expressed in pollen grains, pollen tubes, root tips and other vegetative tissues. The pollen-rescued assays showed that the mutation in AtTMEM18 also caused defects in roots, stems, leaves and transmitting tracts. AtTMEM18-GFP was located around the nuclei. Genetic assays demonstrated that the localization of AtTMEM18 around the nuclei in the generative cells of pollen grains was essential for the male fertility. Furthermore, expression of the rice TMEM18-homologous protein (OsTMEM18) driven by LAT52 promoter could recover the fertility of the Arabidopsis attmem18 mutant. These results suggested that the TMEM18 is important for plant growth in Arabidopsis.
26708413	Polarized Defense Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.	2016	Mol Plant	Modular proteins are an evolutionary answer to optimize performance of proteins that physically interact with each other for functionality. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, we characterized the rice protein OsJAC1, which consists of a jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain predicted to bind mannose-containing oligosaccharides, and a dirigent domain which might function in stereoselective coupling of monolignols. Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. Overexpression of this gene or its wheat ortholog TAJA1 in barley enhanced resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains. Expression of artificially separated and fluorescence-tagged protein domains showed that the JRL domain is sufficient for targeting the powdery mildew penetration site. Nevertheless, co-localization of the lectin and the dirigent domain occurred. Phylogenetic analyses revealed orthologs of OsJAC1 exclusively within the Poaceae plant family. Dicots, by contrast, only contain proteins with either JRL or dirigent domain(s). Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance protein derived from a plant lineage-specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense.
26718470	The Antibiosis Action and Rice-Induced Resistance, Mediated by a Lipopeptide from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens B014, in Controlling Rice Disease Caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	J Microbiol Biotechnol	In the present study, a lipopeptide (named AXLP14) antagonistic to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) was obtained from the culture supernatant of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens B014. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that AXLP14 consisted of surfactin homologs. The minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of AXLP14 against Xoo were determined to be 1.25 and 2.50 mg/ml, respectively. At a concentration of 0.613 mg/ml, AXLP14 strongly inhibited the formation of Xoo biofilm. AXLP14 also inhibited the motility of Xoo in a concentration-dependent manner. Applying AXLP14 to rice seedlings significantly reduced the incidence and severity of disease caused by Xoo. In Xoo-infected rice seedlings, AXLP14 strongly and continuously up-regulated the expression of both OsNPR1 and OsWRKY45. In addition, AXLP14 effectively inhibited the Xoo-induced up-regulation of the expression of the abscisic acid biosynthesis gene OsNECD3 and the abscisic acid signalingresponsive gene OsLip9, indicating that AXLP14 may protect rice against Xoo-induced disease by enhancing salicylic acid defense and interfering with the abscisic acid response to virulence.
26691393	Disruption of OsEXO70A1 Causes Irregular Vascular Bundles and Perturbs Mineral Nutrient Assimilation in Rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Normal uptake, transportation, and assimilation of primary nutrients are essential to plant growth. Tracheary elements (TEs) are tissues responsible for the transport of water and minerals and characterized by patterned secondary cell wall (SCW) thickening. Exocysts are involved in the regulation of SCW deposition by mediating the targeted transport of materials and enzymes to specific membrane areas. EXO70s are highly duplicated in plants and provide exocysts with functional specificity. In this study, we report the isolation of a rice mutant rapid leaf senescence2 (rls2) that exhibits dwarfism, ferruginous spotted necrotic leaves, decreased hydraulic transport, and disordered primary nutrient assimilation. Histological analysis of rls2-1 mutants has indicated impaired cell expansion, collapsed vascular tissues, and irregular SCW deposition. Map-based cloning has revealed that RLS2 encodes OsEXO70A1, which is one of the 47 members of EXO70s in rice. RLS2 was widely expressed and spatially restricted in vascular bundles. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that RLS2 was present on both membrane and nuclear regions. Expression analysis revealed that mutations in rls2 triggers transcriptional fluctuation of orthologous EXO70 genes and affects genes involved in primary nutrient absorption and transport. In brief, our study revealed that RLS2 is required for normal vascular bundle differentiation and primary nutrient assimilation.
26715595	Rice GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 play different roles in ascorbic acid synthesis.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) catalyzes the synthesis of GDP-D-mannose, which is a precursor for ascorbic acid (AsA) synthesis in plants. The rice genome encodes three GMPase homologs OsVTC1-1, OsVTC1-3 and OsVTC1-8, but their roles in AsA synthesis are unclear. The overexpression of OsVTC1-1 or OsVTC1-3 restored the AsA synthesis of vtc1-1 in Arabidopsis, while that of OsVTC1-8 did not, indicating that only OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 are involved in AsA synthesis in rice. Similar to Arabidopsis VTC1, the expression of OsVTC1-1 was high in leaves, induced by light, and inhibited by dark. Unlike OsVTC1-1, the expression level of OsVTC1-3 was high in roots and quickly induced by the dark, while the transcription level of OsVTC1-8 did not show obvious changes under constant light or dark treatments. In OsVTC1-1 RNAi plants, the AsA content of rice leaves decreased, and the AsA production induced by light was limited. In contrast, OsVTC1-3 RNAi lines altered AsA synthesis levels in rice roots, but not in the leaves or under the light/dark treatment. The enzyme activity showed that OsVTC1-1 and OsVTC1-3 had higher GMPase activities than OsVTC1-8 in vitro. Our data showed that, unlike in Arabidopsis, the rice GPMase homologous proteins illustrated a new model in AsA synthesis: OsVTC1-1 may be involved in the AsA synthesis, which takes place in leaves, while OsVTC1-3 may be responsible for AsA synthesis in roots. The different roles of rice GMPase homologous proteins in AsA synthesis may be due to their differences in transcript levels and enzyme activities.
26697042	Comprehensive Expression Profiling of Rice Tetraspanin Genes Reveals Diverse Roles During Development and Abiotic Stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Tetraspanin family is comprised of evolutionarily conserved integral membrane proteins. The incredible ability of tetraspanins to form 'micro domain complexes' and their preferential targeting to membranes emphasizes their active association with signal recognition and communication with neighboring cells, thus acting as key modulators of signaling cascades. In animals, tetraspanins are associated with multitude of cellular processes. Unlike animals, the biological relevance of tetraspanins in plants has not been well investigated. In Arabidopsis tetraspanins are known to contribute in important plant development processes such as leaf morphogenesis, root, and floral organ formation. In the present study we investigated the genomic organization, chromosomal distribution, phylogeny and domain structure of 15 rice tetraspanin proteins (OsTETs). OsTET proteins had similar domain structure and signature 'GCCK/R' motif as reported in Arabidopsis. Comprehensive expression profiling of OsTET genes suggested their possible involvement during rice development. While OsTET9 and 10 accumulated predominantly in flowers, OsTET5, 8, and 12 were preferentially expressed in root tissues. Noticeably, seven OsTETs exhibited more than twofold up regulation at early stages of flag leaf senescence in rice. Furthermore, several OsTETs were differentially regulated in rice seedlings exposed to abiotic stresses, exogenous treatment of hormones and nutrient deprivation. Transient subcellular localization studies of eight OsTET proteins in tobacco epidermal cells showed that these proteins localized in plasma membrane. The present study provides valuable insights into the possible roles of tetraspanins in regulating development and defining response to abiotic stresses in rice. Targeted proteomic studies would be useful in identification of their interacting partners under different conditions and ultimately their biological function in plants.
26697897	OsBRI1 Activates BR Signaling by Preventing Binding between the TPR and Kinase Domains of OsBSK3 via Phosphorylation.	2016	Plant Physiol	Many plant receptor kinases transduce signals through receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs); however, the molecular mechanisms that create an effective on-off switch are unknown. The receptor kinase BR INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) transduces brassinosteroid (BR) signal by phosphorylating members of the BR-signaling kinase (BSK) family of RLCKs, which contain a kinase domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Here, we show that the BR signaling function of BSKs is conserved in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) and that the TPR domain of BSKs functions as a "phospho-switchable" autoregulatory domain to control BSKs' activity. Genetic studies revealed that OsBSK3 is a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice, while in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that OsBRI1 interacts directly with and phosphorylates OsBSK3. The TPR domain of OsBSK3, which interacts directly with the protein's kinase domain, serves as an autoinhibitory domain to prevent OsBSK3 from interacting with bri1-SUPPRESSOR1 (BSU1). Phosphorylation of OsBSK3 by OsBRI1 disrupts the interaction between its TPR and kinase domains, thereby increasing the binding between OsBSK3's kinase domain and BSU1. Our results not only demonstrate that OsBSK3 plays a conserved role in regulating BR signaling in rice, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which BSK family proteins are inhibited under basal conditions but switched on by the upstream receptor kinase BRI1.
26712826	The role of OsMSH4 in male and female gamete development in rice meiosis.	2016	J Exp Bot	Meiosis is essential for gametogenesis in sexual reproduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified a MutS-homolog (MSH) family gene OsMSH4 in a trisomic plant. Cytological analysis showed that developments of both pollen and embryo sacs in an Osmsh4 mutant were blocked due to defective chromosome pairing. Compared with the wild type, the Osmsh4 mutant displayed a significant ~21.9% reduction in chiasma frequency, which followed a Poisson distribution, suggesting that class I crossover formation in the mutant was impaired. Temporal and spatial expression pattern analyses showed that OsMSH4 was preferentially expressed in meiocytes during their meiosis, indicating a critical role in gametogenesis. Subcellular localization showed that OsMSH4-green fluorescent protein was predominantly located in the nucleus. OsMSH4 could interact with another MSH member (OsMSH5) through the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. Direct physical interaction between OsMSH5, OsRPA1a, OsRPA2b, OsRPA1c, and OsRPA2c was identified by yeast two-hybrid assays and further validated by pull-down assays. Our results supported the conclusion that the OsMSH4/5 heterodimer plays a key role in regulation of crossover formation during rice meiosis by interaction with the RPA complex.
26546447	SMAX1-LIKE/D53 Family Members Enable Distinct MAX2-Dependent Responses to Strigolactones and Karrikins in Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Cell	The plant hormones strigolactones and smoke-derived karrikins are butenolide signals that control distinct aspects of plant development. Perception of both molecules in Arabidopsis thaliana requires the F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2). Recent studies suggest that the homologous SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) in Arabidopsis and DWARF53 (D53) in rice (Oryza sativa) are downstream targets of MAX2. Through an extensive analysis of loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis SMAX1-LIKE genes SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 are co-orthologs of rice D53 that promote shoot branching. SMXL7 is degraded rapidly after treatment with the synthetic strigolactone mixture rac-GR24. Like D53, SMXL7 degradation is MAX2- and D14-dependent and can be prevented by deletion of a putative P-loop. Loss of SMXL6,7,8 suppresses several other strigolactone-related phenotypes in max2, including increased auxin transport and PIN1 accumulation, and increased lateral root density. Although only SMAX1 regulates germination and hypocotyl elongation, SMAX1 and SMXL6,7,8 have complementary roles in the control of leaf morphology. Our data indicate that SMAX1 and SMXL6,7,8 repress karrikin and strigolactone signaling, respectively, and suggest that all MAX2-dependent growth effects are mediated by degradation of SMAX1/SMXL proteins. We propose that functional diversification within the SMXL family enabled responses to different butenolide signals through a shared regulatory mechanism.
26546446	Strigolactone Signaling in Arabidopsis Regulates Shoot Development by Targeting D53-Like SMXL Repressor Proteins for Ubiquitination and Degradation.	2015	Plant Cell	Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones that control many aspects of plant development, including shoot branching, leaf shape, stem secondary thickening, and lateral root growth. In rice (Oryza sativa), SL signaling requires the degradation of DWARF53 (D53), mediated by a complex including D14 and D3, but in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components and mechanism of SL signaling involving the D3 ortholog MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) are unknown. Here, we show that SL-dependent regulation of shoot branching in Arabidopsis requires three D53-like proteins, SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2-LIKE6 (SMXL6), SMXL7, and SMXL8. The smxl6 smxl7 smxl8 triple mutant suppresses the highly branched phenotypes of max2 and the SL-deficient mutant max3. Overexpression of a mutant form of SMXL6 that is resistant to SL-induced ubiquitination and degradation enhances shoot branching. Exogenous application of the SL analog rac-GR24 causes ubiquitination and degradation of SMXL6, 7, and 8; this requires D14 and MAX2. D53-like SMXLs form complexes with MAX2 and TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN2 (TPR2) and interact with D14 in a GR24-responsive manner. Furthermore, D53-like SMXLs exhibit TPR2-dependent transcriptional repression activity and repress the expression of BRANCHED1. Our findings reveal that in Arabidopsis, D53-like SMXLs act with TPR2 to repress transcription and so allow lateral bud outgrowth but that SL-induced degradation of D53-like proteins activates transcription to inhibit outgrowth.
26566920	Septin-Dependent Assembly of the Exocyst Is Essential for Plant Infection by Magnaporthe oryzae.	2015	Plant Cell	Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease, the most devastating disease of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and a continuing threat to global food security. To cause disease, the fungus elaborates a specialized infection cell called an appressorium, which breaches the cuticle of the rice leaf, allowing the fungus entry to plant tissue. Here, we show that the exocyst complex localizes to the tips of growing hyphae during vegetative growth, ahead of the Spitzenkörper, and is required for polarized exocytosis. However, during infection-related development, the exocyst specifically assembles in the appressorium at the point of plant infection. The exocyst components Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, and Sec15, and exocyst complex proteins Exo70 and Exo84 localize specifically in a ring formation at the appressorium pore. Targeted gene deletion, or conditional mutation, of genes encoding exocyst components leads to impaired plant infection. We demonstrate that organization of the exocyst complex at the appressorium pore is a septin-dependent process, which also requires regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species by the NoxR-dependent Nox2 NADPH oxidase complex. We conclude that septin-mediated assembly of the exocyst is necessary for appressorium repolarization and host cell invasion.
26578814	Pentatricopeptide-repeat family protein RF6 functions with hexokinase 6 to rescue rice cytoplasmic male sterility.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has been extensively used for hybrid seed production in many major crops. Honglian CMS (HL-CMS) is one of the three major types of CMS in rice and has contributed greatly to food security worldwide. The HL-CMS trait is associated with an aberrant chimeric mitochondrial transcript, atp6-orfH79, which causes pollen sterility and can be rescued by two nonallelic restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, Rf5 or Rf6. Here, we report the identification of Rf6, which encodes a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family protein with a characteristic duplication of PPR motifs 3-5. RF6 is targeted to mitochondria, where it physically associates with hexokinase 6 (OsHXK6) and promotes the processing of the aberrant CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79 at nucleotide 1238, which ensures normal pollen development and restores fertility. The duplicated motif 3 of RF6 is essential for RF6-OsHXK6 interactions, processing of the aberrant transcript, and restoration of fertility. Furthermore, reductions in the level of OsHXK6 result in atp6-orfH79 transcript accumulation and male sterility. Together these results reveal a novel mechanism for CMS restoration by which RF6 functions with OsHXK6 to restore HL-CMS fertility. The present study also provides insight into the function of hexokinase 6 in regulating mitochondrial RNA metabolism and may facilitate further exploitation of heterosis in rice.
26554020	QQS orphan gene regulates carbon and nitrogen partitioning across species via NF-YC interactions.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The allocation of carbon and nitrogen resources to the synthesis of plant proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids is complex and under the control of many genes; much remains to be understood about this process. QQS (Qua-Quine Starch; At3g30720), an orphan gene unique to Arabidopsis thaliana, regulates metabolic processes affecting carbon and nitrogen partitioning among proteins and carbohydrates, modulating leaf and seed composition in Arabidopsis and soybean. Here the universality of QQS function in modulating carbon and nitrogen allocation is exemplified by a series of transgenic experiments. We show that ectopic expression of QQS increases soybean protein independent of the genetic background and original protein content of the cultivar. Furthermore, transgenic QQS expression increases the protein content of maize, a C4 species (a species that uses 4-carbon photosynthesis), and rice, a protein-poor agronomic crop, both highly divergent from Arabidopsis. We determine that QQS protein binds to the transcriptional regulator AtNF-YC4 (Arabidopsis nuclear factor Y, subunit C4). Overexpression of AtNF-YC4 in Arabidopsis mimics the QQS-overexpression phenotype, increasing protein and decreasing starch levels. NF-YC, a component of the NF-Y complex, is conserved across eukaryotes. The NF-YC4 homologs of soybean, rice, and maize also bind to QQS, which provides an explanation of how QQS can act in species where it does not occur endogenously. These findings are, to our knowledge, the first insight into the mechanism of action of QQS in modulating carbon and nitrogen allocation across species. They have major implications for the emergence and function of orphan genes, and identify a nontransgenic strategy for modulating protein levels in crop species, a trait of great agronomic significance.
26523777	Seed filling in domesticated maize and rice depends on SWEET-mediated hexose transport.	2015	Nat Genet	Carbohydrate import into seeds directly determines seed size and must have been increased through domestication. However, evidence of the domestication of sugar translocation and the identities of seed-filling transporters have been elusive. Maize ZmSWEET4c, as opposed to its sucrose-transporting homologs, mediates transepithelial hexose transport across the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the entry point of nutrients into the seed, and shows signatures indicative of selection during domestication. Mutants of both maize ZmSWEET4c and its rice ortholog OsSWEET4 are defective in seed filling, indicating that a lack of hexose transport at the BETL impairs further transfer of sugars imported from the maternal phloem. In both maize and rice, SWEET4 was likely recruited during domestication to enhance sugar import into the endosperm.
26621743	Autotetraploid rice methylome analysis reveals methylation variation of transposable elements and their effects on gene expression.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Polyploidy, or whole-genome duplication (WGD), serves as a key innovation in plant evolution and is an important genomic feature for all eukaryotes. Neopolyploids have to overcome difficulties in meiosis, genomic alterations, changes of gene expression, and epigenomic reorganization. However, the underlying mechanisms for these processes are poorly understood. One of the most interesting aspects is that genome doubling events increase the dosage of all genes. Unlike allopolyploids entangled by both hybridization and polyploidization, autopolyploids, especially artificial lines, in relatively uniform genetic background offer a model system to understand mechanisms of genome-dosage effects. To investigate DNA methylation effects in response to WGD rather than hybridization, we produced autotetraploid rice with its diploid donor, Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. Aijiaonante, both of which were independently self-pollinated over 48 generations, and generated and compared their comprehensive transcriptomes, base pair-resolution methylomes, and siRNAomes. DNA methylation variation of transposable elements (TEs) was observed as widespread in autotetraploid rice, in which hypermethylation of class II DNA transposons was predominantly noted in CHG and CHH contexts. This was accompanied by changes of 24-nt siRNA abundance, indicating the role of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Our results showed that the increased methylation state of class II TEs may suppress the expression of neighboring genes in autotetraploid rice that has obtained double alleles, leading to no significant differences in transcriptome alterations for most genes from its diploid donor. Collectively, our findings suggest that chromosome doubling induces methylation variation in TEs that affect gene expression and may become a "genome shock" response factor to help neoautopolyploids adapt to genome-dosage effects.
26546418	Characterization of 5'UTR of rice ClpB-C/Hsp100 gene: evidence of its involvement in post-transcriptional regulation.	2016	Cell Stress Chaperones	Rice (Oryza sativa) ClpB-C (OsClpB-C) protein is expressed upon heat stress in vegetative tissues and constitutively in seeds. We produced stably transformed Arabidopsis plants carrying β-glucuronidase (Gus) reporter gene downstream to 1-kb OsClpB-C promoter (1kbPro plants). In the 1kbPro plants, expression of Gus transcript and protein followed the expression pattern of OsClpB-C gene in rice plants, i.e., heat induced in vegetative tissues and constitutive in seeds. Next, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing Gus downstream to 862-bp fragment of OsClpB-C promoter [lacking 138 nucleotides from 3' end of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR); ∆UTR plants). In ∆UTR plants, Gus transcript was expressed in heat-inducible manner, but strikingly, Gus protein levels were negligible after heat treatment. However, Gus protein was expressed in ∆UTR seedlings at levels comparable to 1kbPro seedlings when recovery treatment of 22 °C/2 h was given post heat stress (38 °C/15 min). This suggests that 5'UTR of OsClpB-C gene is involved in its post-transcriptional regulation and is an obligate requirement for protein expression during persistent heat stress. Furthermore, the Gus transcript levels were higher in the polysomal RNA fraction in heat-stressed seedlings of 1kbPro plants as compared to ∆UTR plants, indicating that 5'UTR aids in assembly of ribosomes onto the Gus transcript during heat stress. Unlike the case of seedlings, Gus protein was formed constitutively in ∆UTR seeds at levels comparable to 1kbPro seeds. Hence, the function of 5'UTR of OsClpB-C is dispensable for expression in seeds.
26602233	TaXA21-A1 on chromosome 5AL is associated with resistance to multiple pests in wheat.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: The wheat ortholog of the rice gene OsXA21 against bacterial leaf blight showed resistance to multiple pests in bread wheat but different interacting proteins.

ABSTRACT: A quantitative trait locus QYr.osu-5A on the long arm of chromosome 5A in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD) was previously reported to confer consistent resistance in adult plants to predominant stripe rust races, but the gene causing the quantitative trait locus (QTL) is not known. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to saturate the QTL region. Comparative and syntenic regions between wheat and rice (Oryza sativa) were applied to identify candidate genes for QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1, which is referred to as a wheat ortholog of OsXA21-like gene on chromosome 9 in rice, was mapped under the peak of the QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1 not only explained the phenotypic variation in reaction to different stripe rust races but also showed significant effects on resistance to powdery mildew and Hessian fly biotype BP. The natural allelic variation resulted in the alternations of four amino acids in deduced TaXA21-A1 proteins. The interacting proteins of TaXA21-A1 were different from those identified by OsXA21 on rice chromosome 11 against bacterial leaf blight. TaXA21-A1 confers unique resistance against multiple pests in wheat but might not have common protein interactors or thus overlapping functions with OsXA21 in rice. XA21 function has diverged during evolution of cereal crops. The molecular marker developed for TaXA21-A1 would accelerate its application of the candidate gene at the QYr.osu-5A locus in wheat breeding programs.
26564152	The RING Finger Ubiquitin E3 Ligase OsHTAS Enhances Heat Tolerance by Promoting H2O2-Induced Stomatal Closure in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Heat stress often results in the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, which plays a vital role as a secondary messenger in the process of abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated stomatal closure. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) HEAT TOLERANCE AT SEEDLING STAGE (OsHTAS) gene, which plays a positive role in heat tolerance at the seedling stage. OsHTAS encodes a ubiquitin ligase localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. OsHTAS expression was detected in all tissues surveyed and peaked in leaf blade, in which the expression was concentrated in mesophyll cells. OsHTAS was responsive to multiple stresses and was strongly induced by exogenous ABA. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsHTAS interacted with components of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system and an isoform of rice ascorbate peroxidase. OsHTAS modulated hydrogen peroxide accumulation in shoots, altered the stomatal aperture status of rice leaves, and promoted ABA biosynthesis. The results suggested that the RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase OsHTAS functions in leaf blade to enhance heat tolerance through modulation of hydrogen peroxide-induced stomatal closure and is involved in both ABA-dependent and DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE-mediated pathways.
26579177	Overexpression of the CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX6 affects hormone and nitrogen status in rice plants.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are small glutathione dependent oxidoreductases that belong to the Thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily and catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds of their substrate proteins. Plant GRXs include three different groups based on the motif sequence, namely CPYC, CGFS, and CC-type proteins. The rice CC-type proteins, OsGRX6 was identified during the screening for genes whose expression changes depending on the level of available nitrate. Overexpression of OsGRX6 in rice displayed a semi-dwarf phenotype. The OsGRX6 overexpressors contain a higher nitrogen content than the wild type, indicating that OsGRX6 plays a role in homeostatic regulation of nitrogen use. Consistent with this, OsGRX6 overexpressors displayed delayed chlorophyll degradation and senescence compared to the wild type plants. To examine if the growth defect of these transgenic lines attribute to disturbed plant hormone actions, plant hormone levels were measured. The levels of two cytokinins (CKs), 2-isopentenyladenine and trans-zeatin, and gibberellin A1 (GA1) were increased in these lines. We also found that these transgenic lines were less sensitive to exogenously applied GA, suggesting that the increase in GA1 is a result of the feedback regulation. These data suggest that OsGRX6 affects hormone signaling and nitrogen status in rice plants.
26542958	OsNF-YC2 and OsNF-YC4 proteins inhibit flowering under long-day conditions in rice.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: OsNF-YC2 and OsNF-YC4 proteins regulate the photoperiodic flowering response through the modulation of three flowering-time genes ( Ehd1, Hd3a , and RFT1 ) in rice. Plant NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factors control numerous developmental processes by forming heterotrimeric complexes, but little is known about their roles in flowering in rice. In this study, it is shown that some subunits of OsNF-YB and OsNF-YC interact with each other, and among them, OsNF-YC2 and OsNF-YC4 proteins regulate the photoperiodic flowering response of rice. Protein interaction studies showed that the physical interactions occurred between the three OsNF-YC proteins (OsNF-YC2, OsNF-YC4 and OsNF-YC6) and three OsNF-YB proteins (OsNF-YB8, OsNF-YB10 and OsNF-YB11). Repression and overexpression of the OsNF-YC2 and OsNF-YC4 genes revealed that they act as inhibitors of flowering only under long-day (LD) conditions. Overexpression of OsNF-YC6, however, promoted flowering only under LD conditions, suggesting it could function as a flowering promoter. These phenotypes correlated with the changes in the expression of three rice flowering-time genes [Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1)]. The diurnal and tissue-specific expression patterns of the subsets of OsNF-YB and OsNF-YC genes were similar to those of CCT domain encoding genes such as OsCO3, Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Ghd7. We propose that OsNF-YC2 and OsNF-YC4 proteins regulate the photoperiodic flowering response by interacting directly with OsNF-YB8, OsNF-YB10 or OsNF-YB11 proteins in rice.
26617632	Low-Temperature-Induced Expression of Rice Ureidoglycolate Amidohydrolase is Mediated by a C-Repeat/Dehydration-Responsive Element that Specifically Interacts with Rice C-Repeat-Binding Factor 3.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Nitrogen recycling and redistribution are important for the environmental stress response of plants. In non-nitrogen-fixing plants, ureide metabolism is crucial to nitrogen recycling from organic sources. Various studies have suggested that the rate-limiting components of ureide metabolism respond to environmental stresses. However, the underlying regulation mechanism is not well understood. In this report, rice ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (OsUAH), which is a recently identified enzyme catalyzing the final step of ureide degradation, was identified as low-temperature- (LT) but not abscisic acid- (ABA) regulated. To elucidate the LT regulatory mechanism at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of OsUAH (P OsUAH ). Series deletions revealed that a minimal region between -522 and -420 relative to the transcriptional start site was sufficient for the cold induction of P OsUAH . Detailed analyses of this 103-bp fragment indicated that a C-repeat/dehydration-responsive (CRT/DRE) element localized at position -434 was essential for LT-responsive expression. A rice C-repeat-binding factors/DRE-binding proteins 1 (CBFs/DREB1s) subfamily member, OsCBF3, was screened to specifically bind to the CRT/DRE element in the minimal region both in yeast one-hybrid assays and in in vitro gel-shift analysis. Moreover, the promoter could be exclusively trans-activated by the interaction between the CRT/DRE element and OsCBF3 in vivo. These findings may help to elucidate the regulation mechanism of stress-responsive ureide metabolism genes and provide an example of the member-specific manipulation of the CBF/DREB1 subfamily.
26600124	Oryza sativa Chloroplast Signal Recognition Particle 43 (OscpSRP43) Is Required for Chloroplast Development and Photosynthesis.	2015	PLoS One	A rice chlorophyll-deficient mutant w67 was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced IR64 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) mutant bank. The mutant exhibited a distinct yellow-green leaf phenotype in the whole plant growth duration with significantly reduced levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid, impaired chloroplast development and lowered capacity of photosynthesis compared with the wild-type IR64. Expression of a number of genes associated with chlorophyll metabolism, chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthesis was significantly altered in the mutant. Genetic analysis indicated that the yellow-green phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Using map-based strategy, the mutation was isolated and predicted to encode a chloroplast signal recognition particle 43 KD protein (cpSRP43) with 388 amino acid residuals. A single base substitution from A to T at position 160 resulted in a premature stop codon. OscpSRP43 was constitutively expressed in various organs with the highest level in the leaf. Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype and subcellular localization showed that the cpSRP43:GFP fusion protein was targeted to the chloroplast. The data suggested that Oryza sativa cpSRP43 (OscpSRP43) was required for the normal development of chloroplasts and photosynthesis in rice.
26530963	Direct suppression of a rice bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) by monoterpene (S)-limonene.	2016	Protoplasma	Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a severe disease of rice plants. Upon pathogen infection, rice biosynthesizes phytoalexins, including diterpenoids such as momilactones, phytocassanes, and oryzalexins. However, information on headspace volatiles in response to Xoo infection is limited. We have examined headspace volatile terpenes, induced by the infection of Xoo, and investigated their biological roles in the rice plant. Monoterpenes α-thujene, α-pinene, sabinene, myrcene, α-terpene, and (S)-limonene and sesquiterpenes cyclosativene, α-copaene, and β-elemene were detected from 1-week-old Xoo-infected rice seedlings, by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All monoterpenes were constitutively released from rice seedlings before Xoo infection. However, (S)-limonene emission was further elicited after exposure of the seedlings to Xoo in coincidence with upregulation of limonene synthase gene (OsTPS20) transcripts. Only the stereospecific (S)-limonene [and not (R)-limonene or other monoterpenes] severely inhibited Xoo growth, as confirmed by disc diffusion and liquid culture assays. Rice seedlings showed suppressed pathogenic symptoms suggestive of resistance to Xoo infection after foliar treatment with (S)-limonene. Collectively, our findings suggest that (S)-limonene is a volatile phytoanticipin, which plays a significant role in suppressing Xoo growth in rice seedlings.
26607766	Combining mapping of physiological quantitative trait loci and transcriptome for cold tolerance for counteracting male sterility induced by low temperatures during reproductive stage in rice.	2016	Physiol Plant	Male sterility induced by low temperatures (LTs) during the reproductive stage is a major constraint for temperate zone rice. To detect physiological quantitative trait loci (QTLs), we modeled genotypic variation in the physiological processes involved in low temperature spikelet sterility on the basis of anther length (AL), a proxy for microspore and pollen grain number per anther. The model accounted for 83% of the genotypic variation in potential AL at normal temperature and the ability to maintain AL at LT. We tested the model on 208 recombinant inbred lines of cold-tolerant 'Tohoku-PL3' (PL3) × cold-sensitive 'Akihikari' (AH) for 2 years. QTLs for spikelet fertility (FRT) at LT were detected on chromosomes 5 (QTL for Cold Tolerance at Reproductive stage, qCTR5) and 12 (qCTR12). qCTR12 was annotated with the ability to maintain AL under LTs. qCTR5 was in a region shared with QTLs for culm length and heading date. Genome-wide expression analysis showed 798 genes differentially expressed in the spikelets between the parents at LTs. Of these, 12 were near qCTR5 and 23 were near qCTR12. Gene expression analysis confirmed two candidate genes for qCTR5 (O-methyltransferase ZRP4, Os05g0515600; beta-1,3-glucanase-like protein, Os05g0535100) and one for qCTR12 (conserved hypothetical protein, Os12g0550600). Nucleotide polymorphisms (21 deletions, 2 insertions and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in PL3 were found near the candidate conserved hypothetical protein (Os12g0550600) and upstream in PL3, but not in AH. Haplotype analysis revealed that this gene came from 'Kuchum'. The combination of mapping physiological QTLs with gene expression analysis can be extended to identify other genes for abiotic stress response in cereals.
26612069	Uncovering novel loci for mesocotyl elongation and shoot length in indica rice through genome-wide association mapping.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Totally, 23 loci were detected, and 383 candidate genes were identified, and four of these candidate genes, Os01g0392100, Os04g0630000, Os01g0904700 and Os07g0615000, were regarded as promising targets. Direct-seeding cultivation is becoming popular in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-planting countries because it is labor- and time-efficient. However, low seedling establishment and slow seedling emergence have restricted the application and popularity of the technique. Mesocotyl elongation and shoot length are two important traits that can enhance rice seedling emergence. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a genome sequence variation caused by a single base within a population, and SNPs evenly distributed throughout the genomes of plant species. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS), based on 4136 SNPs, was performed using a compressed mixed linear model that accounted for population structure and relative kinship to detect novel loci for the two traits. Totally, 23 loci were identified, including five loci located known QTLs region. For the mesocotyl elongation, 17 major loci were identified, explaining ~19.31 % of the phenotypic variation. For the shoot length, six major loci were detected, explaining ~ 39.79 % of the phenotypic variation. In total, 383 candidate genes were included in a 200-kb genomic region (± 100 kb of each locus). Additionally, 32 SNPs were identified in 30 candidate genes. Relative expression level analyses indicated that four candidate genes containing SNP variations, Os01g0392100, Os04g0630000, Os01g0904700 and Os07g0615000, represented promising targets. Finally, eight elite accessions with long mesocotyl and shoot lengths were chosen as breeding donors for further rice direct-seeding variety modifications.
26563345	A strong root-specific expression system for stable transgene expression in bread wheat.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A strong, stable and root-specific expression system was developed from a rice root-specific GLYCINE - RICH PROTEIN 7 promoter for use as an enabling technology for genetic manipulation of wheat root traits. Root systems play an important role in wheat productivity. Genetic manipulation of wheat root traits often requires a root-specific or root-predominant expression system as an essential enabling technology. In this study, we investigated promoters from rice root-specific or root-predominant expressed genes for development of a root expression system in bread wheat. Transient expression analysis using a GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) reporter gene driven by rice promoters identified six promoters that were strongly expressed in wheat roots. Extensive organ specificity analysis of three rice promoters in transgenic wheat revealed that the promoter of rice GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 7 (OsGRP7) gene conferred a root-specific expression pattern in wheat. Strong GFP fluorescence in the seminal and branch roots of wheat expressing GFP reporter driven by the OsGRP7 promoter was detected in epidermal, cortical and endodermal cells in mature parts of the root. The GFP reporter driven by the promoter of rice METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (OsMTL1) gene was mainly expressed in the roots with essentially no expression in the leaf, stem or seed. However, it was also expressed in floral organs including glume, lemma, palea and awn. In contrast, strong expression of rice RCg2 promoter-driven GFP was found in many tissues. The GFP expression driven by these three rice promoters was stable in transgenic wheat plants through three generations (T1-T3) examined. These data suggest that the OsGRP7 promoter can provide a strong, stable and root-specific expression system for use as an enabling technology for genetic manipulation of wheat root traits.
26633564	Regulation of grain yield in rice under well-watered and drought stress conditions by GUDK.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Increasing the grain yield of cereals, which is stable under unfavorable environmental stress, is a major objective to sustain production and feed the growing world population. Recently, we functionally characterized a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, named GROWTH UNDER DROUGHT KINASE (GUDK), revealing its role in regulating grain yield under well-watered and drought stress conditions by transphosphorylating the OsAP37 transcription factor. GUDK is induced under several stresses and its loss-of-function increased the sensitivity of rice seedlings to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment. In addition to reduced tolerance of gudk mutant plants to drought stress at vegetative stage, a significant reduction in grain yield was observed under well-watered and drought stress conditions at reproductive stage. Gene co-expression analysis supports the role of GUDK in regulating important biological processes both under control and stress conditions. Thus, our results suggest that GUDK has the potential to regulate grain yield both under favorable and unfavorable conditions.
26598971	Functional Inactivation of Putative Photosynthetic Electron Acceptor Ferredoxin C2 (FdC2) Induces Delayed Heading Date and Decreased Photosynthetic Rate in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Ferredoxin (Fd) protein as unique electron acceptor, involved in a variety of fundamental metabolic and signaling processes, which is indispensable for plant growth. The molecular mechanisms of Fd such as regulation of electron partitioning, impact of photosynthetic rate and involvement in the carbon fixing remain elusive in rice. Here we reported a heading date delay and yellowish leaf 1 (hdy1) mutant derived from Japonica rice cultivar "Nipponbare" subjected to EMS treatment. In the paddy field, the hdy1 mutant appeared at a significantly late heading date and had yellow-green leaves during the whole growth stage. Further investigation indicated that the abnormal phenotype of hdy1 was connected with depressed pigment content and photosynthetic rate. Genetic analysis results showed that the hdy1 mutant phenotype was caused by a single recessive nuclear gene mutation. Map-based cloning revealed that OsHDY1 is located on chromosome 3 and encodes an ortholog of the AtFdC2 gene. Complementation and overexpression, transgenic plants exhibited the mutant phenotype including head date, leaf color and the transcription levels of the FdC2 were completely rescued by transformation with OsHDY1. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression product of OsHDY1 was detected in almost all of the organs except root, whereas highest expression levels were observed in seeding new leaves. The lower expression levels of HDY1 and content of iron were detected in hdy1 than WT's. The FdC2::GFP was detected in the chloroplasts of rice. Real-time PCR results showed that the expression of many photosynthetic electron transfer related genes in hdy1 were higher than WT. Our results suggest that OsFdC2 plays an important role in photosynthetic rate and development of heading date by regulating electron transfer and chlorophyll content in rice.
26475189	Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.	2015	Plant Sci	Alteration of storage substances, in particular the major storage form starch, leads to floury endosperm. Because floury mutants have physical attributes for milling processes, identification and characterization of those mutants are valuable. In this study we identified a floury endosperm mutant caused by a T-DNA insertion in Oryza sativa alanine-aminotransferase1 (OsAlaAT1). OsAlaAT1 is localized in the cytosol and has aminotransferase enzyme activity. The osalaat1 mutant has less amylose and its amylopectin is structurally altered. OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis. AlaAT catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate to alanine, and this pathway is activated under low-oxygen conditions. Consistently, OsAlaAT1 is induced by such conditions. Expression of the starch synthesis genes AGPases, OsSSI, OsSSIIa, and OsPPDKB is decreased in the mutant. Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen.
26607171	A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca2+/cation transport in yeast.	2015	Sci Rep	In plant cell, cations gradient in cellular compartments is maintained by synergistic action of various exchangers, pumps and channels. The Arabidopsis exchanger family members (AtCCX3 and AtCCX5) were previously studied and belong to CaCA (calcium cation exchangers) superfamily while none of the rice CCXs has been functionally characterized for their cation transport activities till date. Rice genome encode four CCXs and only OsCCX2 transcript showed differential expression under abiotic stresses and Ca(2+) starvation conditions. The OsCCX2 localized to tonoplast and suppresses the Ca(2+) sensitivity of K667 (low affinity Ca(2+) uptake deficient) yeast mutant under excess CaCl2 conditions. In contrast to AtCCXs, OsCCX2 expressing K667 yeast cells show tolerance towards excess Na(+), Li(+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) and suggest its ability to transport both mono as well as divalent cations in yeast. Additionally, in contrast to previously characterized AtCCXs, OsCCX2 is unable to complement yeast trk1trk2 double mutant suggesting inability to transport K(+) in yeast system. These finding suggest that OsCCX2 having distinct metal transport properties than previously characterized plant CCXs. OsCCX2 can be used as potential candidate for enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance in plants as well as for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soil.
26578743	Root aeration improves growth and nitrogen accumulation in rice seedlings under low nitrogen.	2015	AoB Plants	In wetland soils, changes in oxygen (O2) level in the rhizosphere are believed to influence the behaviour of nutrients and their usage by plants. However, the effect of aeration on nitrogen (N) acquisition under different N supply conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, the rice cultivars Yangdao 6 (YD6, with higher root aerenchyma abundance) and Nongken 57 (NK57, with lower root aerenchyma abundance) were used to evaluate the effects of aeration on rice growth and N accumulation. Our results showed that the number of adventitious roots and the root surface area increased significantly, and ethylene production and aerenchyma formation decreased in both cultivars after external aeration (EA). Five N treatments, including no N (-N), 0.125 mM NH4NO3 (LN), 1.25 mM Ca(NO3)2 (NO3-N), 1.25 mM (NH4)2SO4 (NH4-N) and 1.25 mM NH4NO3 (N/N), were applied to YD6 and NK57 for 2 days under internal aeration or EA conditions. External aeration increased the root biomass in both cultivars and the shoot biomass in NK57 by 18-50 %. The total N concentrations in roots of YD6 grown under -N and LN and of NK57 grown under NO3-N were increased by EA. Expression of OsPAD4, one of four putative genes regulating aerenchyma formation, showed a similar pattern alongside changes in the ethylene level in the EA-treated rice irrespective of the N treatments. Furthermore, expression of the high-affinity nitrate transporter gene OsNRT2.1 was increased by EA under -N, LN and NO3-N conditions. Our data provide evidence of an interaction between O2 and the supply of N in ethylene production, aerenchyma formation and N nutrition through modification of the expression of OsPAD4 and OsNRT2.1.
26486445	VLN2 Regulates Plant Architecture by Affecting Microfilament Dynamics and Polar Auxin Transport in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	As a fundamental and dynamic cytoskeleton network, microfilaments (MFs) are regulated by diverse actin binding proteins (ABPs). Villins are one type of ABPs belonging to the villin/gelsolin superfamily, and their function is poorly understood in monocotyledonous plants. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in VILLIN2 (VLN2), which exhibits malformed organs, including twisted roots and shoots at the seedling stage. Cellular examination revealed that the twisted phenotype of the vln2 mutant is mainly caused by asymmetrical expansion of cells on the opposite sides of an organ. VLN2 is preferentially expressed in growing tissues, consistent with a role in regulating cell expansion in developing organs. Biochemically, VLN2 exhibits conserved actin filament bundling, severing and capping activities in vitro, with bundling and stabilizing activity being confirmed in vivo. In line with these findings, the vln2 mutant plants exhibit a more dynamic actin cytoskeleton network than the wild type. We show that vln2 mutant plants exhibit a hypersensitive gravitropic response, faster recycling of PIN2 (an auxin efflux carrier), and altered auxin distribution. Together, our results demonstrate that VLN2 plays an important role in regulating plant architecture by modulating MF dynamics, recycling of PIN2, and polar auxin transport.
26434724	Natural Variations in SLG7 Regulate Grain Shape in Rice.	2015	Genetics	Rice (Oryza sativa) grain shape, which is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL), has a strong effect on yield production and quality. However, the molecular basis for grain development remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel QTL, Slender grain on chromosome 7 (SLG7), that is responsible for grain shape, using backcross introgression lines derived from 9311 and Azucena. The SLG7 allele from Azucena produces longer and thinner grains, although it has no influence on grain weight and yield production. SLG7 encodes a protein homologous to LONGIFOLIA 1 and LONGIFOLIA 2, both of which increase organ length in Arabidopsis. SLG7 is constitutively expressed in various tissues in rice, and the SLG7 protein is located in plasma membrane. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that SLG7 produces slender grains by longitudinally increasing cell length, while transversely decreasing cell width, which is independent from cell division. Our findings show that the functions of SLG7 family members are conserved across monocots and dicots and that the SLG7 allele could be applied in breeding to modify rice grain appearance.
26479032	Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex.	2015	Nature	Eukaryotes rely on efficient distribution of energy and carbon skeletons between organs in the form of sugars. Glucose in animals and sucrose in plants serve as the dominant distribution forms. Cellular sugar uptake and release require vesicular and/or plasma membrane transport proteins. Humans and plants use proteins from three superfamilies for sugar translocation: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the sodium solute symporter family (SSF; only in the animal kingdom), and SWEETs. SWEETs carry mono- and disaccharides across vacuolar or plasma membranes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in sugar translocation between compartments, cells, and organs, notably in nectar secretion, phloem loading for long distance translocation, pollen nutrition, and seed filling. Plant SWEETs cause pathogen susceptibility possibly by sugar leakage from infected cells. The vacuolar Arabidopsis thaliana AtSWEET2 sequesters sugars in root vacuoles; loss-of-function mutants show increased susceptibility to Pythium infection. Here we show that its orthologue, the vacuolar glucose transporter OsSWEET2b from rice (Oryza sativa), consists of an asymmetrical pair of triple-helix bundles, connected by an inversion linker transmembrane helix (TM4) to create the translocation pathway. Structural and biochemical analyses show OsSWEET2b in an apparent inward (cytosolic) open state forming homomeric trimers. TM4 tightly interacts with the first triple-helix bundle within a protomer and mediates key contacts among protomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the close paralogue SWEET1 from Arabidopsis identified key residues in substrate translocation and protomer crosstalk. Insights into the structure-function relationship of SWEETs are valuable for understanding the transport mechanism of eukaryotic SWEETs and may be useful for engineering sugar flux.
26486444	VILLIN2 Emerges as a Master Builder in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	
26519999	Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions.	2016	Gene	Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice crop is the need of the hour for reduction of nitrous oxide emission resulting from excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application and also in reduction of cost of cultivation. Ten rice genotypes were grown under low and recommended dose of N application and characterized in terms of parameters related to yield, yield related components and NUE indicators. Wide genetic variability under low N conditions was observed with significant variation for 15 yield related parameters in interactions of genotypes and treatment. Limitation of N has led to the decrease of all yield and yield related parameters, but for grain filling % and 1000 grain weight. Two genotypes, Rasi and Varadhan have shown minimum differences between low and recommended N conditions. Correlation analysis of various yield components showed the importance of the secondary branches for the total grains under low N. Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes. The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P<0.05) with N% in grain. Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice.
26428067	Over-expression of an S-domain receptor-like kinase extracellular domain improves panicle architecture and grain yield in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	The S-domain receptor kinase (SRK) comprises a highly polymorphic subfamily of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) originally found to be involved in the self-incompatibility response in Brassica. Although several members have been identified to play roles in developmental control and disease responses, the correlation between SRKs and yield components in rice is still unclear. The utility of transgenic expression of a dominant negative form of SRK, OsLSK1 (Large spike S-domain receptor like Kinase 1), is reported here for the improvement of grain yield components in rice. OsLSK1 was highly expressed in nodes of rice and is a plasma membrane protein. The expression of OsLSK1 responded to the exogenous application of growth hormones, to abiotic stresses, and its extracellular domain could form homodimers or heterodimers with other related SRKs. Over-expression of a truncated version of OsLSK1 (including the extracellular and transmembrane domain of OsLSK1 without the intracellular kinase domain) increased plant height and improve yield components, including primary branches per panicle and grains per primary branch, resulting in about a 55.8% increase of the total grain yield per plot (10 plants). Transcriptional analysis indicated that several key genes involved in the GA biosynthetic and signalling pathway were up-regulated in transgenic plants. However, full-length cDNA over-expression and RNAi of OsLSK1 transgenic plants did not exhibit a detectable visual phenotype and possible reasons for this were discussed. These results indicate that OsLSK1 may act redundantly with its homologues to affect yield traits in rice and manipulation of OsLSK1 by the dominant negative method is a practicable strategy to improve grain yield in rice and other crops.
26438231	Protein repair L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase 1 (PIMT1) in rice improves seed longevity by preserving embryo vigor and viability.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Damaged proteins containing abnormal isoaspartyl (isoAsp) accumulate as seeds age and the abnormality is thought to undermine seed vigor. Protein-L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is involved in isoAsp-containing protein repair. Two PIMT genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.), designated as OsPIMT1 and OsPIMT2, were isolated and investigated for their roles. The results indicated that OsPIMT2 was mainly present in green tissues, but OsPIMT1 largely accumulated in embryos. Confocal visualization of the transient expression of OsPIMTs showed that OsPIMT2 was localized in the chloroplast and nucleus, whereas OsPIMT1 was predominately found in the cytosol. Artificial aging results highlighted the sensitivity of the seeds of OsPIMT1 mutant line when subjected to accelerated aging. Overexpression of OsPIMT1 in transgenic seeds reduced the accumulation of isoAsp-containing protein in embryos, and increased embryo viability. The germination percentage of transgenic seeds overexpressing OsPIMT1 increased 9-15% compared to the WT seeds after 21-day of artificial aging, whereas seeds from the OsPIMT1 RNAi lines overaccumulated isoAsp in embryos and experienced rapid loss of seed germinability. Taken together, these data strongly indicated that OsPIMT1-related seed longevity improvement is probably due to the repair of detrimental isoAsp-containing proteins that over accumulate in embryos when subjected to accelerated aging.
26505346	Characterization of OsPM19L1 encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	The plant-specific AWPM-19-domain proteins play important roles in plant development and stress responses. In the current study, OsPM19L1 encoding Oryza sativa AWPM-19-like protein 1 was isolated from rice. Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that OsPM19L1 was highly expressed in the leaf sheath of rice. Interestingly, expression of OsPM19L1 was high at the early stage of panicle development and decreased thereafter. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that OsPM19L1 was dramatically induced by 20% PEG stress (>600-fold), exogenous abscisic acid (>350-fold), salt and cold stress. Subcellular localization assay suggested that the OsPM19L1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein was localized in the membrane system in rice cells. Moreover, under stress conditions, OsPM19L1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates OsPM19L1 gene expression. Thus, OsPM19L1 appears to be closely associated with stress tolerance through ABA-dependent pathway in rice.
26503287	Genome-wide survey and expression analysis of the OSCA gene family in rice.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Reception of and response to exogenous and endogenous osmotic changes is important to sustain plant growth and development, as well as reproductive formation. Hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels (OSCA) were first characterised as an osmosensor in Arabidopsis and are involved in the perception of extracellular changes to trigger hyperosmolality-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases (OICI). To explore the potential biological functions of OSCAs in rice, we performed a bioinformatics and expression analysis of the OsOSCA gene family.

RESULTS: A total of 11 OsOSCA genes were identified from the genome database of Oryza sativa L. Japonica. Based on their sequence composition and phylogenetic relationship, the OsOSCA family was classified into four clades. Gene and protein structure analysis indicated that the 11 OsOSCAs shared similar structures with their homologs in Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica, Oryza glaberrima, and Oryza brachyantha. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed a conserved DUF221 domain in these members, in which the first three TMs were conserved, while the others were not. The expression profiles of OsOSCA genes were analysed at different stages of vegetative growth, reproductive development, and under osmotic-associated abiotic stresses. We found that four and six OsOSCA genes showed a clear correlation between the expression profile and osmotic changes during caryopsis development and seed imbibition, respectively. Orchestrated transcription of three OsOSCAs was strongly associated with the circadian clock. Moreover, osmotic-related abiotic stress differentially induced the expression of 10 genes.

CONCLUSION: The entire OSCA family is characterised by the presence of a conserved DUF221 domain, which functions as an osmotic-sensing calcium channel. The phylogenetic tree of OSCA genes showed that two subspecies of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica and Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica, are more closely related than wild rice Oryza glaberrima, while Oryza brachyantha was less closely related. OsOSCA expression is organ- and tissue-specific and regulated by different osmotic-related abiotic stresses in rice. These findings will facilitate further research in this gene family and provide potential target genes for generation of genetically modified osmotic-stress-resistant plants.
26473514	Non-canonical structure, function and phylogeny of the Bsister MADS-box gene OsMADS30 of rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Plant J	Bsister MADS-box genes play key roles in female reproductive organ and seed development throughout seed plants. This view is supported by their high conservation in terms of sequence, expression and function. In grasses, there are three subclades of Bsister genes: the OsMADS29-, the OsMADS30- and the OsMADS31-like genes. Here, we report on the evolution of the OsMADS30-like genes. Our analyses indicate that these genes evolved under relaxed purifying selection and are rather weakly expressed. OsMADS30, the representative of the OsMADS30-like genes from rice (Oryza sativa), shows strong sequence deviations in its 3' region when compared to orthologues from other grass species. We show that this is due to a 2.4-kbp insertion, possibly of a hitherto unknown helitron, which confers a heterologous C-terminal domain to OsMADS30. This putative helitron is not present in the OsMADS30 orthologues from closely related wild rice species, pointing to a relatively recent insertion event. Unlike other Bsister mutants O. sativa plants carrying a T-DNA insertion in the OsMADS30 gene do not show aberrant seed phenotypes, indicating that OsMADS30 likely does not have a canonical 'Bsister function'. However, imaging-based phenotyping of the T-DNA carrying plants revealed alterations in shoot size and architecture. We hypothesize that sequence deviations that accumulated during a period of relaxed selection in the gene lineage that led to OsMADS30 and the alteration of the C-terminal domain might have been a precondition for a potential neo-functionalization of OsMADS30 in O. sativa.
26537047	OsHAL3, a Blue Light-Responsive Protein, Interacts with the Floral Regulator Hd1 to Activate Flowering in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	In flowering plants, photoperiodic flowering is controlled by a complicated network. Light is one of the most important environmental stimuli that control the timing of the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development. Several photoreceptors, including PHYA, PHYB, CRY2, and FKF1 in Arabidopsis and their homologs (OsPHYA, OsPHYB, OsPHYC, and OsCRY2) in rice, have been identified to be related to flowering. Our previous study suggests that OsHAL3, a flavin mononucleotide-binding protein, may function as a blue-light sensor. Here, we report the identification of OsHAL3 as a positive regulator of flowering in rice. OsHAL3 overexpression lines exhibited an early flowering phenotype, whereas downregulation of OsHAL3 expression by RNA interference delayed flowering under an inductive photoperiod (short-day conditions). The change in flowering time was not accompanied by altered Hd1 expression but rather by reduced accumulation of Hd3a and MADS14 transcripts. OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized in the nucleus and physically interacted in vivo under the dark, whereas their interaction was inhibited by white or blue light. Moreover, OsHAL3 directly bound to the promoter of Hd3a, especially before dawn. We conclude that OsHAL3, a novel light-responsive protein, plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice, which is probably mediated by forming a complex with Hd1. Our findings open up new perspectives on the photoperiodic flowering pathway.
26443376	Rice ONAC106 Inhibits Leaf Senescence and Increases Salt Tolerance and Tiller Angle.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	NAM/ATAF1/ATAF2/CUC2 (NAC) is a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) family, and NACs participate in many diverse processes during the plant life cycle. Several Arabidopsis thaliana NACs have important roles in positively or negatively regulating leaf senescence, but in other plant species, including rice, the senescence-associated NACs (senNACs) remain largely unknown. Here we show that the rice senNAC TF ONAC106 negatively regulates leaf senescence. Leaves of onac106-1D (insertion of the 35S enhancer in the promoter region of the ONAC106 gene) mutants retained their green color under natural senescence and dark-induced senescence conditions. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that key senescence-associated genes (SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, OsNAP, OsEIN3 and OsS3H) were differentially expressed in onac106-1D during dark-induced senescence. In addition to delayed senescence, onac106-1D also showed a salt stress-tolerant phenotype; key genes that down-regulate salt response signaling (OsNAC5, OsDREB2A, OsLEA3 and OsbZIP23) were rapidly up-regulated in onac106-1D under salt stress. Interestingly, onac106-1D also exhibited a wide tiller angle phenotype throughout development, and the tiller angle-related gene LPA1 was down-regulated in onac106-1D. Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5 and LPA1. Taking these results together, we propose that ONAC106 functions in leaf senescence, salt stress tolerance and plant architecture by modulating the expression of its target genes that function in each signaling pathway.
26485146	Abiotic Stresses Antagonize the Rice Defence Pathway through the Tyrosine-Dephosphorylation of OsMPK6.	2015	PLoS Pathog	Plants, as sessile organisms, survive environmental changes by prioritizing their responses to the most life-threatening stress by allocating limited resources. Previous studies showed that pathogen resistance was suppressed under abiotic stresses. Here, we show the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Phosphorylation of WRKY45, the central transcription factor in salicylic-acid (SA)-signalling-dependent pathogen defence in rice, via the OsMKK10-2-OsMPK6 cascade, was required to fully activate WRKY45. The activation of WRKY45 by benzothiadiazole (BTH) was reduced under low temperature and high salinity, probably through abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. An ABA treatment dephosphorylated/inactivated OsMPK6 via protein tyrosine phosphatases, OsPTP1/2, leading to the impaired activation of WRKY45 and a reduction in Magnaporthe oryzae resistance, even after BTH treatment. BTH induced a strong M. oryzae resistance in OsPTP1/2 knockdown rice, even under cold and high salinity, indicating that OsPTP1/2 is the node of SA-ABA signalling crosstalk and its down-regulation makes rice disease resistant, even under abiotic stresses. These results points to one of the directions to further improve crops by managing the tradeoffs between different stress responses of plants.
26491145	ABA Regulates Subcellular Redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a Negative Regulator in ABA Signaling, to Control Root Architecture and Drought Resistance in Oryza sativa.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The phytohormone ABA is a key stress signal in plants. Although the identification of ABA receptors led to significant progress in understanding the Arabidopsis ABA signaling pathway, there are still many unsolved mysteries regarding ABA signaling in monocots, such as rice. Here, we report that a rice ortholog of AtABI1 and AtABI2, named OsABI-LIKE2 (OsABIL2), plays a negative role in rice ABA signaling. Overexpression of OsABIL2 not only led to ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomatal density and root architecture, which probably caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress. OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1. However, unlike many other solely nuclear-localized clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), OsABIL2 is localized in both the nucleus and cytosol. Furthermore, OsABIL2 interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of OsABIL2, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling. Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of OsABIL2 in regulating root development.
26706074	Methyl jasmonate inhibits lamina joint inclination by repressing brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Lamina joint inclination or leaf angle (the angle between the leaf blade and vertical culm) is a major trait of rice plant architecture. The plant hormone brassinosteroid (BR) is the main regulator of this trait, while other plant hormones, including ethylene, gibberellin, and auxin, also influence leaf angle. In this study, we found that methyl jasmonate (MeJA) also participates in regulating lamina joint inclination. MeJA decreased lamina joint inclination and inhibited the BR-induced increase in lamina joint inclination. Furthermore, addition of a BR synthesis inhibitor increased the extent of change in lamina joint inclination in response to treatment with a low concentration of MeJA (0.05 or 0.5mgL(-1)), but it did not alter the lamina joint inclination of plants treated with a high concentration of MeJA (5mgL(-1)). Further studies showed that MeJA treatment significantly repressed the expression of BR biosynthesis-related genes and decreased endogenous BRs levels. In addition, the lamina joint inclination in the OsBRI1 mutant d61-1 was less sensitive to MeJA compared with its wild type counterpart, and lithium chloride-induced inactivation of GSK3-like kinase, a negative regulator of BR signaling, partly rescued the MeJA-induced reduction in lamina joint inclination. Further studies showed that MeJA treatment reduced the mRNA levels of BR signaling and target genes. These results indicate that MeJA-inhibition of lamina joint inclination may depend on BR biosynthesis and the BR signaling pathway.
26706071	The NF-YA transcription factor OsNF-YA7 confers drought stress tolerance of rice in an abscisic acid independent manner.	2015	Plant Sci	The mechanisms of plant response and adaptation to drought stress require the regulation of transcriptional networks via the induction of drought-responsive transcription factors. Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factors have aroused interest in roles of plant drought stress responses. However, the molecular mechanism of the NF-Y-induced drought tolerance is not well understood. Here, we functionally analyzed two rice NF-YA genes, OsNF-YA7 and OsNF-YA4. Expression of OsNF-YA7 was induced by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants improved their drought tolerance. In contrast, OsNF-YA4 expression was not increased by drought stress and its overexpression in transgenic rice plants did not affect their sensitivity to drought stress. OsNF-YA4 expression was highly induced by the stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA), while OsNF-YA7 was not, indicating that OsNF-YA7 mediates drought tolerance in an ABA-independent manner. Analysis of the OsNF-YA7 promoter revealed three ABA-independent DRE/CTR elements and RNA-seq analysis identified 48 genes downstream of OsNFYA7 action putatively involved in the OsNF-YA7-mediated drought tolerance pathway. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for OsNF-YA7 in rice drought stress tolerance.
26507552	Action of multiple intra-QTL genes concerted around a co-localized transcription factor underpins a large effect QTL.	2015	Sci Rep	Sub-QTLs and multiple intra-QTL genes are hypothesized to underpin large-effect QTLs. Known QTLs over gene families, biosynthetic pathways or certain traits represent functional gene-clusters of genes of the same gene ontology (GO). Gene-clusters containing genes of different GO have not been elaborated, except in silico as coexpressed genes within QTLs. Here we demonstrate the requirement of multiple intra-QTL genes for the full impact of QTL qDTY12.1 on rice yield under drought. Multiple evidences are presented for the need of the transcription factor 'no apical meristem' (OsNAM12.1) and its co-localized target genes of separate GO categories for qDTY12.1 function, raising a regulon-like model of genetic architecture. The molecular underpinnings of qDTY12.1 support its effectiveness in further improving a drought tolerant genotype and for its validity in multiple genotypes/ecosystems/environments. Resolving the combinatorial value of OsNAM12.1 with individual intra-QTL genes notwithstanding, identification and analyses of qDTY12.1has fast-tracked rice improvement towards food security.
26453745	Overexpression of OsCYP19-4 increases tolerance to cold stress and enhances grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Exp Bot	AtCYP19-4 (also known as CYP5) was previously identified as interacting in vitro with GNOM, a member of a large family of ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors that is required for proper polar localization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1. The present study demonstrated that OsCYP19-4, a gene encoding a putative homologue of AtCYP19-4, was up-regulated by several stresses and showed over 10-fold up-regulation in response to cold. The study further demonstrated that the promoter of OsCYP19-4 was activated in response to cold stress. An OsCYP19-4-GFP fusion protein was targeted to the outside of the plasma membrane via the endoplasmic reticulum as determined using brefeldin A, a vesicle trafficking inhibitor. An in vitro assay with a synthetic substrate oligomer confirmed that OsCYP19-4 had peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, as was previously reported for AtCYP19-4. Rice plants overexpressing OsCYP19-4 showed cold-resistance phenotypes with significantly increased tiller and spike numbers, and consequently enhanced grain weight, compared with wild-type plants. Based on these results, the authors suggest that OsCYP19-4 is required for developmental acclimation to environmental stresses, especially cold. Furthermore, the results point to the potential of manipulating OsCYP19-4 expression to enhance cold tolerance or to increase biomass.
26526688	Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MPK) Interacts With Auxin Influx Carrier (OsAux/LAX1) Involved in Auxin Signaling in Plant.	2015	Biol Proced Online	BACKGROUND: Mitogen activated protein kinases (MPKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that contain characteristic T-x-Y motif in the activation loop region. MPKs are important signaling molecules involved in diverse signaling cascades that regulate plant growth, development and stress responses by conducting phosphorylation events in their target proteins. MPKs phosphorylate their target proteins at either S-P/T-P (Serine/Proline/Threonine) amino acid. To understand, if MPKs are involved in the auxin signaling cascade, we identified probable target proteins of MPKs involved in auxin signaling or transport processes.

RESULTS: A genome-wide search of the rice genome database led us to identification of the OsAux/LAX1 gene as a potential downstream target protein of MPKs. In-silico analysis predicted that MPKs interact with OsAux/LAX1 proteins which were validated by a yeast two-hybrid assay that showed OsMPK3, OsMPK4 and OsMPK6 are physically interact with OsAux/LAX1 protein.

CONCLUSION: The yeast two-hybrid interaction showed that MPKs are directly involved in auxin signaling events in plants. This is the first study to report direct involvement of MPKs in the auxin signaling pathway.
26480952	TaGS5-3A, a grain size gene selected during wheat improvement for larger kernel and yield.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Grain size is a dominant component of grain weight in cereals. Earlier studies have shown that OsGS5 plays a major role in regulating both grain size and weight in rice via promotion of cell division. In this study, we isolated TaGS5 homoeologues in wheat and mapped them on chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D. Temporal and spatial expression analysis showed that TaGS5 homoeologues were preferentially expressed in young spikes and developing grains. Two alleles of TaGS5-3A, TaGS5-3A-T and TaGS5-3A-G were identified in wheat accessions, and a functional marker was developed to discriminate them. Association analysis revealed that TaGS5-3A-T was significantly correlated with larger grain size and higher thousand kernel weight. Biochemical assays showed that TaGS5-3A-T possesses a higher enzymatic activity than TaGS5-3A-G. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing TaGS5-3A-T also exhibited larger grain size and higher thousand kernel weight than TaGS5-3A-G lines, and the transcript levels of cell cycle-related genes in TaGS5-3A-T lines were higher than those in TaGS5-3A-G lines. Furthermore, systematic evolution analysis in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat showed that TaGS5-3A underwent strong artificial selection during wheat polyploidization events and the frequency changes of two alleles demonstrated that TaGS5-3A-T was favoured in global modern wheat cultivars. These results suggest that TaGS5-3A is a positive regulator of grain size and its favoured allele TaGS5-3A-T exhibits a larger potential application in wheat high-yield breeding.
26435218	Isolation and characterization of three cadmium-inducible promoters from Oryza sativa.	2015	J Biotechnol	Cadmium (Cd) is an important soil pollutant. Developing genetically engineered crops might be a feasible strategy for Cd decontamination and damage prevention. Both genes and promoters are critical for the effective construction of genetically modified plants. Although many functional genes for Cd tolerance and accumulation have been identified, few reports have focused on plant Cd-inducible promoters. Here, we identified three Cd-inducible genes in the rice genome: two tau class glutathione S-transferase (GSTU) genes, OsGSTU5 and OsGSTU37, and an HSP20/alpha crystallin family protein gene, OsHSP18.6. The promoter sequences were isolated and tested in transgenic rice lines using a GUSplus reporter gene. All of the promoters exhibited low background expression under normal conditions and could be strongly induced by Cd stress. Although their strength was comparable to that of the constitutive OsACTIN promoter under Cd stress, their time-dependent expression patterns under both short- and long-term Cd exposure were markedly different. The responses of the three promoters to other heavy metals were also examined. Furthermore, heavy metal-responsive cis elements in the promoters were computationally analyzed, and regions determining the Cd stress response were analyzed using a series of truncations. Our results indicate that the three Cd-inducible rice promoters described herein could potentially be used in applications aimed at improving heavy metal tolerance in crops or for the bio-monitoring of environmental contamination.
26507364	Putative zeatin O-glucosyltransferase OscZOG1 regulates root and shoot development and formation of agronomic traits in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	As a ubiquitous reaction, glucosylation controls the bioactivity of cytokinins in plant growth and development. Here we show that genetic manipulation of zeatin-O-glucosylation regulates the formation of important agronomic traits in rice by manipulating the expression of OscZOG1 gene, encoding a putative zeatin O-glucosyltransferase. We found that OscZOG1 was preferentially expressed in shoot and root meristematic tissues and nascent organs. The growth of lateral roots was stimulated in the overexpression lines, but inhibited in RNA interference lines. In shoots, knockdown of OscZOG1 expression by RNA interference significantly improved tillering, panicle branching, grain number per panicle and seed size, which are important agronomic traits for grain yield. In contrast, constitutive expression of OscZOG1 leads to negative effects on the formation of the grain-yielding traits with a marked increase in the accumulation levels of cis-zeatin O-glucoside (cZOG) in the transgenic rice plants. In this study, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of improving the critical yield-determinant agronomic traits, including tiller number, panicle branches, total grain number per panicle and grain weight by downregulating the expression level of OscZOG1. Our results suggest that modulating the levels of cytokinin glucosylation can function as a fine-tuning switch in regulating the formation of agronomic traits in rice.
26466818	Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Jasmonic acid (JA) and related metabolites play a key role in plant defense and growth. JA carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT) may be involved in plant defense and development by methylating JA to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and thus influencing the concentrations of JA and related metabolites. However, no JMT gene has been well characterized in monocotyledon defense and development at the molecular level. After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA. OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens). Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield. These oe-JMT plants also exhibited increased MeJA levels but reduced levels of herbivore-induced JA and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). The oe-JMT plants were more attractive to BPH female adults but showed increased resistance to BPH nymphs, probably owing to the different responses of BPH female adults and nymphs to the changes in levels of H2 O2 and MeJA in oe-JMT plants. These results indicate that OsJMT1, by altering levels of JA and related metabolites, plays a role in regulating plant development and herbivore-induced defense responses in rice.
26482477	Identification of a regulatory element responsible for salt induction of rice OsRAV2 through ex situ and in situ promoter analysis.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Salt is a major environmental stress factor that can affect rice growth and yields. Recent studies suggested that members of the AP2/ERF domain-containing RAV (related to ABI3/VP1) TF family are involved in abiotic stress adaptation. However, the transcriptional response of rice RAV genes (OsRAVs) to salt has not yet been fully characterized. In this study, the expression patterns of all five OsRAVs were examined under salt stress. Only one gene, OsRAV2, was stably induced by high-salinity treatment. Further expression profile analyses indicated that OsRAV2 is transcriptionally regulated by salt, but not KCl, osmotic stress, cold or ABA (abscisic acid) treatment. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the stress response at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of OsRAV2 (P OsRAV2 ). Transgenic analysis indicated that P OsRAV2 is induced by salt stress but not osmotic stress or ABA treatment. Serial 5' deletions and site-specific mutations in P OsRAV2 revealed that a GT-1 element located at position -664 relative to the putative translation start site is essential for the salt induction of P OsRAV2 . The regulatory function of the GT-1 element in the salt induction of OsRAV2 was verified in situ in plants with targeted mutations generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) system. Taken together, our results indicate that the GT-1 element directly controls the salt response of OsRAV2. This study provides a better understanding of the putative functions of OsRAVs and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of plant genes under salt stress.
26483819	Grain setting defect1 (GSD1) function in rice depends on S-acylation and interacts with actin 1 (OsACT1) at its C-terminal.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Grain setting defect1 (GSD1), a plant-specific remorin protein specifically localized at the plasma membrane (PM) and plasmodesmata of phloem companion cells, affects grain setting in rice through regulating the transport of photoassimilates. Here, we show new evidence demonstrating that GSD1 is localized at the cytoplasmic face of the PM and a stretch of 45 amino acid residues at its C-terminal is required for its localization. Association with the PM is mediated by S-acylation of cysteine residues Cys-524 and Cys-527, in a sequence of 45 amino acid residues essential for GSD1 function in rice. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain in GSD1 is necessary for sufficient interaction with OsACT1. Together, these results reveal that GSD1 attaches to the PM through S-acylation and interacts with OsACT1 through its coiled-coil domain structure to regulate plasmodesmata conductance for photoassimilate transport in rice.
26483814	OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	OsCYP21-4 is a rice cyclophilin protein that binds to cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant drug. CYP21-4s in Arabidopsis and rice were previously shown to function as mitochondrial cyclophilins, as determined by TargetP analysis. In the current study, we found that OsCYP21-4-GFP localized to the Golgi, rather than mitochondria, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, which was confirmed based on its co-localization with cis Golgi α-ManI-mCherry protein. OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness. CYP21-4 homologs do not possess key peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity/cyclosporine A (CsA) binding residues, and recombinant OsCYP21-4 protein did not convert the synthetic substrate Suc-AAPF-pNA via cis- trans- isomerization in vitro. In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP21-4 exhibited increased tolerance to salinity and hydrogen peroxide treatment, along with increased peroxidase activity. These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity.
26398804	A lipid transfer protein, OsLTPL36, is essential for seed development and seed quality in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Storage lipid is a vital component for maintaining structure of seed storage substances and valuable for rice quality and food texture. However, the knowledge of lipid transporting related genes and their function in seed development have not been well elucidated yet. In this study, we identified OsLTPL36, a homolog of putative lipid transport protein, and showed specific expression in rice developing seed. Transcriptional profiling and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsLTPL36 was exclusively expressed in developing seed coat and endosperm aleurone cells. Down-regulated expression of OsLTPL36 led to decreased seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight in transgenic plants. Further studies showed that suppressed expression of OsLTPL36 caused chalky endosperm and resulted in reduced fat acid content in RNAi lines as compared with wild type (WT). Histological analysis showed that the embryo development was delayed after down regulation of OsLTPL36. Moreover, impeded seed germination and puny seedling were also observed in the OsLTPL36 RNAi lines. The data demonstrated that OsLTPL36, a lipid transporter, was critical important not only for seed quality but also for seed development and germination in rice.
26706069	Rice Ovate Family Protein 2 (OFP2) alters hormonal homeostasis and vasculature development.	2015	Plant Sci	OFP (Ovate Family Protein) is a transcription factor family found only in plants. In dicots, OFPs control fruit shape and secondary cell wall biosynthesis. OFPs are also thought to function through interactions with KNOX and BELL transcription factors. Here, we have functionally characterized OsOFP2, a member of the OFP subgroup associated with regulating fruit shape. OsOFP2 was found to localize to the nucleus and to the cytosol. A putative nuclear export signal was identified within the OVATE domain and was required for the localization of OsOFP2 to distinct cytosolic spots. Rice plants overexpressing OsOFP2 were reduced in height and exhibited altered leaf morphology, seed shape, and positioning of vascular bundles in stems. Transcriptome analysis indicated disruptions of genes associated with vasculature development, lignin biosynthesis, and hormone homeostasis. Reduced expression of the gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA 20-oxidase 7 coincided with lower gibberellin content in OsOFP2 overexpression lines. Also, we found that OsOFP2 was expressed in plant vasculature and determined that putative vascular development KNOX and BELL proteins interact with OsOFP2. KNOX and BELL genes are known to suppress gibberellin biosynthesis through GA20ox gene regulation and can restrict lignin biosynthesis. We propose that OsOFP2 could modulate KNOX-BELL function to control diverse aspects of development including vasculature development.
26481009	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: OsSAPK8 is an essential activator of OsSLAC1 by phosphorylation, and OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel. S-type anion channel AtSLAC1 and protein kinase AtOST1 have been well-characterized as two core components of ABA signaling cascade in Arabidopsis guard cells, and AtOST1 functions as a main upstream activator of AtSLAC1 for drought stress- and ABA-induced stomata closure. However, the identity of the ortholog of AtOST1 in rice, the main activator of OsSLAC1, is still unknown. Here, we report that protein kinase OsSAPK8 interacts with and activates OsSLAC1 mainly by phosphorylating serine 129 (S129) of OsSLAC1, and this phosphorylating site corresponds to the specific phosphorylating site serine 120 (S120) of AtSLAC1 for AtOST1. Additionally, we found that OsSLAC1 is a nitrate-selective anion channel without obvious permeability to chloride, malate, and sulfate, and the expression of OsSLAC1 in Arabidopsis slac1-3 (atslac1-3) mutant successfully rescued the hypersensitive phenotype of this mutant to drought stress. Together, this research suggests that OsSAPK8 is a counterpart of AtOST1 for the activation of OsSLAC1, which is a nitrate-selective anion channel.
26426417	A knowledge-based molecular screen uncovers a broad-spectrum OsSWEET14 resistance allele to bacterial blight from wild rice.	2015	Plant J	Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are type III-delivered transcription factors that enhance the virulence of plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species through the activation of host susceptibility (S) genes. TAL effectors recognize their DNA target(s) via a partially degenerate code, whereby modular repeats in the TAL effector bind to nucleotide sequences in the host promoter. Although this knowledge has greatly facilitated our power to identify new S genes, it can also be easily used to screen plant genomes for variations in TAL effector target sequences and to predict for loss-of-function gene candidates in silico. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we screened a germplasm of 169 rice accessions for polymorphism in the promoter of the major bacterial blight susceptibility S gene OsSWEET14, which encodes a sugar transporter targeted by numerous strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. We identified a single allele with a deletion of 18 bp overlapping with the binding sites targeted by several TAL effectors known to activate the gene. We show that this allele, which we call xa41(t), confers resistance against half of the tested Xoo strains, representative of various geographic origins and genetic lineages, highlighting the selective pressure on the pathogen to accommodate OsSWEET14 polymorphism, and reciprocally the apparent limited possibilities for the host to create variability at this particular S gene. Analysis of xa41(t) conservation across the Oryza genus enabled us to hypothesize scenarios as to its evolutionary history, prior to and during domestication. Our findings demonstrate that resistance through TAL effector-dependent loss of S-gene expression can be greatly fostered upon knowledge-based molecular screening of a large collection of host plants.

15159631	In vitro reconstitution of rice anthranilate synthase: distinct functional properties of the alpha subunits OASA1 and OASA2.	2004	Plant Mol Biol	Anthranilate synthase (AS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of various indole compounds including tryptophan. AS consists of two subunits, alpha and beta, and converts chorismate to anthranilate. Two or more AS alpha-subunit genes have been identified and characterized in several land plants. Although alpha subunits of AS induced by elicitation have been suggested to play significant roles in secondary metabolism, the biochemical and precise functional properties of individual AS isozymes have remained unclear. We have previously identified and characterized two AS alpha-subunit genes (OASA1 and OASA2) in rice (Oryza sativa ). To provide further insight into the enzymatic functions of AS isozymes in rice, we have now isolated rice cDNAs encoding the AS beta subunits OASB1 and OASB2 and reconstituted AS isozymes in vitro with the wheat germ cell-free system for protein expression. Both OASB subunits conferred glutamine-dependent AS activity on either OASA1 or OASA2, indicating the absence of a marked functional difference between the two beta subunits in terms of amidotransferase activity. Furthermore, both OASA subunits required assembly with a beta subunit to achieve maximal enzymatic activity even with NH(4)(+) as the amino donor. The V (max) and K (i) for tryptophan of the OASA1-OASB1 isozyme with glutamine as the amino donor, however, were 2.4 and 7.5 times, respectively, those of OASA2-OASB1, suggesting that AS isozymes containing OASA1 possess a higher activity and are less sensitive to feedback inhibition than those containing OASA2. Our biochemical characterization of reconstituted AS isozymes has thus revealed distinct functional properties of these isozymes in rice.
11972021	Utility and distribution of conserved noncoding sequences in the grasses.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Control of gene expression requires cis-acting regulatory DNA sequences. Historically these sequences have been difficult to identify. Conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) have recently been identified in mammalian genes through cross-species genomic DNA comparisons, and some have been shown to be regulatory sequences. Using sequence alignment algorithms, we compared genomic noncoding DNA sequences of the liguleless1 (lg1) genes in two grasses, maize and rice, and found several CNSs in lg1. These CNSs are present in multiple grass species that represent phylogenetically disparate lineages. Six other maize/rice genes were compared and five contained CNSs. Based on nucleotide substitution rates, these CNSs exist because they have biological functions. Our analysis suggests that grass CNSs are smaller and far less frequent than those identified in mammalian genes and that mammalian gene regulation may be more complex than that of grasses. CNSs make excellent pan-grass PCR-based genetic mapping tools. They should be useful as characters in phylogenetic studies and as monitors of gene regulatory complexity.
12434003	A RelA-SpoT homolog (Cr-RSH) identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii generates stringent factor in vivo and localizes to chloroplasts in vitro.	2002	Nucleic Acids Res	A gene encoding a putative guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) synthase-degradase, designated Cr-RSH, was identified in the unicellular photosynthetic eukaryote Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The encoded Cr-RSH protein possesses a putative chloroplast-targeting signal at its NH2-terminus, and translocation of Cr-RSH into chloroplasts isolated from C.reinhardtii was demonstrated in vitro. The predicted mature region of Cr-RSH exhibits marked similarity to eubacterial members of the RelA-SpoT family of proteins. Expression of an NH2-terminal portion of Cr-RSH containing the putative ppGpp synthase domain in a relA, spoT double mutant of Escherichia coli complemented the growth deficits of the mutant cells. Chromatographic analysis of 32P-labeled cellular mononucleotides also revealed that expression of Cr-RSH in the mutant bacterial cells resulted in the synthesis of ppGpp. SpoT, which catalyzes (p)ppGpp degradation, is dispensable in E.coli only if cells also lack RelA, which possesses (p)ppGpp synthase activity. The complementation analysis thus indicated that Cr-RSH possesses both ppGpp synthase and degradase activities. These results represent the first demonstration of ppGpp synthase-degradase activities in a eukaryotic organism, and they suggest that eubacterial stringent control mediated by ppGpp has been conserved during evolution of the chloroplast from a photosynthetic bacterial symbiont.
11328648	Identification and characterization of the gene encoding the mitochondrial elongation factor G in rice.	2000	DNA Seq	A plant nuclear gene coding for a mitochondrial elongation factor G (mEF-G) was cloned from a cDNA library and genomic library of rice (Oryza sativa L.). This DNA sequence predicts a 757-amino-acid protein exhibiting 79%, 55% and 49% homology to Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rat mEF-G respectively, 53% homology to the elongation factor G in Escherichia coli and 43% homology to soybean chloroplast elongation factor G. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the characteristic motifs shared by all GTP binding proteins. Comparison of the sequence of the genomic clone to that of the cDNA clone revealed that this gene is split nineteen times by introns, although the gene of Arabidopsis is split seventeen times by introns. Some of the introns found in the rice genome are relatively long and they result in a long gene with a size of approximately 15 kb.
11913775	Identification and characterization of two genes encoding the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A in rice.	2001	DNA Seq	A cDNA encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) was isolated from a cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Based on this DNA sequence, a 414-amino acid protein exhibiting 67, 64 and 59% homology to the mouse, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4A, respectively, was predicted. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the characteristic motifs shared by the DEAD box supergene family. Another cDNA of rice eIF4A was reported previously. Comparison of the coding sequences of the two rice eIF4As showed 85% homology in the nucleotide sequence and 90% homology in the amino acid sequence. The genomic clones corresponding to the two rice eIF4A cDNAs were also isolated from a genomic library of rice (Oryza sativa L.). It was found that the two genes have common patterns of exon-intron boundaries. Their coding regions are split into four exons, and there is an additional exon in the 5'-non coding region.
11697144	Isolation and characterization of two genes encoding ubiquitin fused to a ribosomal protein of 53 amino acids in rice.	2001	DNA Seq	We isolated and determined the nucleotide sequences of two genes encoding ubiquitin fused to a ribosomal protein, Ub-CEP52, from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The deduced amino-acid sequences of the two genes were found to be completely identical. The N-terminal region of 76 residues corresponds to ubiquitin, and the C-terminal region of 53 residues corresponds to ribosomal protein L40. A putative TATA-like sequence, a polypyrimidine sequence, and a similar sequence to telo-box were found in the promoter regions of the two genes. Furthermore, the putative tRNA(Pro) gene was found in the 5'-upstream region of one of them.
15078334	Characterization of heterotrimeric G protein complexes in rice plasma membrane.	2004	Plant J	Two genes in the rice genome were identified as those encoding the gamma subunits, gamma1 and gamma2, of heterotrimeric G proteins. Using antibodies against the recombinant proteins for the alpha, beta, gamma1, and gamma2 subunits of the G protein complexes, all of the subunits were proven to be localized in the plasma membrane in rice. Gel filtration of solubilized plasma membrane proteins showed that all of the alpha subunits were present in large protein complexes (about 400 kDa) containing the other subunits, beta, gamma1, and gamma2, and probably also some other proteins, whereas large amounts of the beta and gamma (gamma1 and gamma2) subunits were freed from the large complexes and took a 60-kDa form. A yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the beta subunit interacted tightly with the gamma1 and gamma2 subunits, and so the beta and gamma subunits appeared to form dimers in rice cells. Some dimers were associated with the alpha subunit, because few beta, gamma1, and gamma2 subunits were present in the 400-kDa complexes in a rice mutant, d1, which was lacking in the alpha subunit. When a constitutively active form of the alpha subunit was prepared by the exchange of one amino acid residue and introduced into d1, the mutagenized subunit was localized in the plasma membrane of the transformants and took a free, and not the 400-kDa, form.
8706734	Identification and characterization of a rice cysteine endopeptidase that digests glutelin.	1996	Eur J Biochem	Little or no endopeptidase activity was detected in extracts from storage organs of dark-grown rice seeds until day 6 of post-imbibition, and the activity expressed per seed increased notably after day 9, reached a maximum on day 18, then decreased. Two major endopeptidases, REP-1 and REP-2, were present in the 40-75% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction from day-9 germinated seeds, and could be separated by hydrophobic column chromatography. REP-1 was further purified to a single polypeptide of 36 kDa. REP-1 digested in vitro both the acidic and basic subunits of rice glutelin, the major seed storage protein of rice. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence and experiments with protease inhibitors indicated that REP-1 is a cysteine endopeptidase. The nucleotide sequence of a full-length REP-1 cDNA was determined by a combination of screening of cDNA libraries from rice seeds and the 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique.
10394640	The structure and organization of two cysteine endopeptidase genes from rice.	1999	Plant Cell Physiol	REP-1 is a major cysteine endopeptidase that digests seed storage glutelin of rice. A cDNA clone (pRP60) for REP-1 and a cDNA clone (pRP80) for a related enzyme were previously isolated. The expression of both mRNAs is regulated by gibberellin. In this study, we revealed the structure and organization of Rep1 and RepA, genes corresponding to pRP60 and pRP80 mRNAs, respectively. Rep1 has no introns whereas RepA consists of five exons and four introns, and both genes exist as one copy gene in the rice genome. The gibberellin-responsive elements conserved in cereal alpha-amylase genes are not included in the 5'-upstream region of Rep1 or RepA. A molecular phylogenetic tree of plant cysteine endopeptidases was constructed, and their relationship was discussed.
16028112	Characterization of plant Aurora kinases during mitosis.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	The Aurora kinase family is a well-characterized serine/threonine protein kinase family that regulates different processes of mitotic events. Although functions of animal and yeast Aurora kinases have been analyzed, plant aurora kinases were not identified and characterized. We identified three Aurora kinase orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana and designated these as AtAUR1, AtAUR2, and AtAUR3. These AtAURs could phosphorylate serine 10 in histone H3, in vitro. Dynamic analyses of GFP-fused AtAUR proteins revealed that AtAUR1 and AtAUR2 localized at the nuclear membrane in interphase and located in mitotic spindles during cell division. AtAUR1 also localized in the cell plates. AtAUR3 showed dot-like distribution on condensed chromosomes at prophase and then localized at the metaphase plate. At late anaphase, AtAUR3 is evenly localized on chromosomes. The localization of AtAUR3 during mitosis is very similar to that of phosphorylated histone H3. Interestingly, an overexpression of AtAUR3 induces disassembly of spindle microtubules and alteration of orientation of cell division. Our results indicate that plant Aurora kinases have different characters from that of Aurora kinases of other eukaryotes.
1302636	Molecular characterization of cDNA encoding for adenylate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1992	Plant J	Two types of genes (Adk-a, and Adk-b) encoding for adenylate kinase (AK, EC 2.7.4.3.) were isolated from the cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two cDNAs were heterogeneous at 5' and 3' ends of non-coding sequences and had possible polyadenylation signals. One of the genes, Adk-a, had 1154 bp sequences encoding 241 amino acid residues, while the other type, Adk-b, contained 1085 bp sequences encoding for 243 amino acid residues. Homology between Adk-a and Adk-b was 73.7% in nucleotide sequences, and 90.8% in amino acid level. Two genes showed about 53% homology to bovine mitochondrial adenylate kinase (AK2) at nucleotide and amino acid levels. Concerning the codon usage of rice AK genes, T was abundant at the third position of a codon in the reading frames. In order to examine the enzyme activity of the protein encoded by the rice cDNA, Adk-a was cloned into an expression vector, pUC119, which was introduced into Escherichia coli strain CV2, a temperature-sensitive mutant of adenylate kinase. We found that the transformant carrying the rice Adk-a gene in the sense orientation recovered cell growth at non-permissive high temperature (42 degrees C) and expressed enzyme activities higher than the untransformed CV2 and the transformant possessing Adk-a cDNA in the antisense orientation. These observations suggest that rice Adk-a codes a biologically active enzyme. Furthermore, sucrose was found to regulate the transcription of AK genes in rice cell cultures. Organ related accumulation of mRNA in whole plants was also found.
10618494	Evolutionally conserved plant homologue of the Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) gene capable of suppressing Bax-induced cell death in yeast(1).	1999	FEBS Lett	The plant homologue of Bax Inhibitor-1, a gene described to suppress the cell death induced by Bax gene expression in yeast, was isolated from Oryza sativa L. (rice) and Arabidopsis. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein was well conserved in both animal and plant (45% in amino acids) and contained six or seven membrane-spanning segments. Northern blot analysis showed that OsBI-1 transcripts were present in all tissues examined. The OsBI-1 cDNA suppressed cell death induced by mammalian Bax in yeast, suggesting functional conservation of this BI-1 homologue in the plant kingdom.
8325505	The gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase located near the sbe1 gene encoding starch branching enzyme I is specifically expressed in developing rice seeds.	1993	Gene	A gene (spk) encoding a Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase (SPK) is located in the region immediately upstream of the sbe1 gene encoding a starch branching enzyme. The spk gene is specifically expressed in developing seeds and its expression pattern is very similar to those of genes encoding starch-synthesizing enzymes such as sbe1 and waxy, seed lipid-synthesizing enzymes, as well as genes encoding seed storage proteins. A full-length spk cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from developing seeds. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that SPK has a high degree of homology to soybean and carrot Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase, both of which contain calmodulin domains. The calmodulin domain, as well as the catalytic subdomain consensus regions of protein kinases are highly conserved in SPK. These results suggest that a tissue- and stage-specific protein kinase, SPK, is involved in the synthesis of seed storage compounds during seed development. They also strongly suggest that Ca2+ is required for seed development.
8455548	Molecular analysis of the gene encoding a rice starch branching enzyme.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	The sequence of a rice gene encoding a starch branching enzyme (sbe1) shows extreme divergence from that of the rice gene, that is homologous to bacterial glycogen branching enzyme (sbe2). sbe1 is expressed abundantly and specifically in developing seeds and maximally in the middle stages of seed development. This expression pattern completely coincides with that of the waxy gene, which encodes a granule-bound starch synthase. Three G-box motifs and consensus promoter sequences are present in the 5' flanking region of sbe1. It encodes a putative transit peptide, which is required for transport into the amyloplast. A 2.2 kb intron (intron 2) precedes the border between the regions encoding the transit peptide and the mature protein, and contains a high G/C content with several repeated sequences in its 5' half. Although only a single copy of sbe1 is present in the rice genome, Southern analysis using intron 2 as a probe indicates the presence of several homologous sequences in the rice genome, suggesting that this large intron and also the transit peptide coding region may be acquired from another portion of the genome by duplication and insertion of the sequence into the gene.
10485927	The small GTP-binding protein rac is a regulator of cell death in plants.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cell death plays important roles in the development and defense of plants as in other multicellular organisms. Rapid production of reactive oxygen species often is associated with plant defense against pathogens, but their molecular mechanisms are not known. We introduced the constitutively active and the dominant negative forms of the small GTP-binding protein OsRac1, a rice homolog of human Rac, into the wild type and a lesion mimic mutant of rice and analyzed H(2)O(2) production and cell death in transformed cell cultures and plants. The results indicate that Rac is a regulator of reactive oxygen species production as well as cell death in rice.
2717416	The sequence of the rice phytochrome gene.	1989	Nucleic Acids Res	
12782297	A pentatricopeptide repeat-containing gene that promotes the processing of aberrant atp6 RNA of cytoplasmic male-sterile rice.	2003	FEBS Lett	A fertility restorer gene (Rf-1) of [ms-bo] cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in rice has been reported to be responsible for the processing of RNA of aberrant atp6 of mitochondria. We have carried out map-based cloning of the Rf-1 gene and found that a 4.7-kb genomic fragment of a restorer line promoted the processing of aberrant atp6 RNA when introduced into a CMS line. The genomic fragment contained a single open reading frame encoding 18 repeats of the 35 amino acid pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif. The cloned PPR gene is a possible candidate of Rf-1. A non-restoring genotype was identified to have deletions within the coding region.
9490748	A plant homolog of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase gp91phox subunit gene encodes a plasma membrane protein with Ca2+ binding motifs.	1998	Plant Cell	Rapid generation of O2- and H2O2, which is reminiscent of the oxidative burst in neutrophils, is a central component of the resistance response of plants to pathogen challenge. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis rbohA (for respiratory burst oxidase homolog A) gene encodes a putative 108-kD protein, with a C-terminal region that shows pronounced similarity to the 69-kD apoprotein of the gp91phox subunit of the neutrophil respiratory burst NADPH oxidase. The RbohA protein has a large hydrophilic N-terminal domain that is not present in gp91phox. This domain contains two Ca2+ binding EF hand motifs and has extended similarity to the human RanGTPase-activating protein 1. rbohA, which is a member of a divergent gene family, generates transcripts of 3.6 and 4.0 kb that differ only in their polyadenylation sites. rbohA transcripts are most abundant in roots, with weaker expression in aerial organs and seedlings. Antibodies raised against a peptide near the RbohA C terminus detected a 105-kD protein that, unlike gp91phox, does not appear to be highly glycosylated. Cell fractionation, two-phase partitioning, and detergent extraction indicate that RbohA is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein. We propose that plants have a plasma membrane enzyme similar to the neutrophil NADPH oxidase but with novel potential regulatory mechanisms for Ca2+ and G protein stimulation of O2- and H2O2 production at the cell surface.
1646373	Isolation and molecular evolutionary analysis of a cytochrome c gene from Oryza sativa (rice)	1991	Mol Biol Evol	A cytochrome c gene, OsCc-1, from rice (Oryza sativa) has been isolated and analyzed. The OsCc-1 gene encodes a cytochrome c protein that is typical of higher-plant cytochrome c proteins. OsCc-1 consists of three exons separated by two introns that are 817 and 747 bp in length, respectively. From genomic DNA hybridization analysis, OsCc-1 appears to be one of possibly two cytochrome c genes in several Asian, American, and Indian rice species and varieties surveyed. A single, unique cytochrome c gene appears to be present in one African cultivated rice species. We performed comparative molecular evolutionary analyses of OsCc-1 and other cytochrome c genes. We calculated a unit evolutionary period of 19.4 Myr for cytochrome c DNA sequences, which agrees closely with previous estimates based on protein sequence comparisons.
9484469	Isolation, characterization and mRNA expression of four cDNAs encoding translation elongation factor 1A from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1998	Plant Mol Biol	Four different cDNA clones encoding protein synthesis elongation factor 1A, eEF1A, were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The genes encoded by these cDNAs were designated rice elongation factor 1A genes refa1, refa2, refa3 and refa4. The genes encoded identical eEF-1A polypeptides and shared high amino acid identity with eEF1A of other eukaryotes. Southern blot analysis suggested that some of these refa genes may be organized in a cluster on the same chromosome within a short distance. PCR analysis of rice genomic DNA showed that refa1 and refa4, and refa3 and refa2 are in neighboring locations on the rice genome. The mRNAs of the four refa genes accumulated to nearly equal levels in a variety of tissues and at different stages of growth. Suspension-cultured cells were the most abundant in refa mRNAs. Dormant seeds contained a small amount of the four refa mRNAs. Transcript accumulation was highly induced after seed germination, and the same expression levels were maintained even in old leaf blades of mature plants.
8405471	Molecular structure of ras-related small GTP-binding protein genes of rice plants and GTPase activities of gene products in Escherichia coli.	1993	FEBS Lett	We isolated two rice cDNA clones (ric1 and ric2) encoding proteins homologous to the ras-related small GTP-binding protein. The amino acid sequences of ric1 and ric2 are conserved in four regions involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis which are characteristic in the ras and ras-related small GTP-binding protein genes. In addition, two consecutive cysteine residues near the carboxyl-terminal end required for membrane anchoring are also present in ric1 and ric2. The ric1 and ric2 proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli possessed GTPase activity (i.e. hydrolysis of GTP to GDP).
7678761	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA similar to the bovine brain-specific 14-3-3 protein gene.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA clone which is similar to the bovine brain-specific 14-3-3 protein (an activator protein of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase involved in the synthetic pathway of monoamine) gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA indicated a surprising similarity to a potent inhibitor of Ca(2+)-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. DNA blot analysis indicated that this gene is located at more than a single locus in rice genome DNA. Expression of this gene is regulated by external stresses.
8493114	Plant cDNA homologue to rat insulinoma gene encoding ribosomal protein S15.	1993	Nucleic Acids Res	
7703506	Nucleotide sequence of rice (oryza sativa L.) cDNA homologous to cdc2 gene.	1994	DNA Seq	We isolated and determined a nucleotide sequence of a rice DNA clone (SS224) denoted to rcdc2. This clone encodes an open reading frame of 302 amino acids and typical three conserved domains that exist in all cdc2 homologues. The evolutionary tree showed that rcdc2 was far from cdc2 and its homologous genes identified in various plants.
7510136	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA similar to the S-phase-specific cyc07 gene.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA clone (T151) which encodes an open reading frame of 262 amino acids. This clone is similar to the S-phase-specific cyc07 gene of Catharanthus roseus. Expression of this gene is much higher in callus than in seedlings and regulated by external stresses such as high osmotic pressure, salinity, low temperature and submergence.
9742959	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding the gamma-subunit of translation elongation factor 1B (eEF1Bgamma).	1998	FEBS Lett	We isolated a rice cDNA clone (refg) encoding the gamma-subunit of translation elongation factor 1B (eEF-1B gamma; the old designation was EF-1 gamma). The refg encodes an open reading frame of 419 amino acids which shows a similarity to the equivalent sequences from animals and yeast. Complex formation analysis, which showed the recombinant protein of refg (His-eEF1B gamma) and formed a complex with GST-eEF-1Bbeta, indicated that the refg encodes rice eEF1B gamma of the eEF1B alphabeta gamma complex. Expression analysis showed that refg mRNA is very abundant in suspension-cultured cells during the exponential phase of growth. A DNA blot analysis indicated that refg is located at a single locus in the rice genome.
10080717	Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa).	1999	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes. The deduced amino acid sequence was 88% and 91% homologous to those of the enzymes from barley and broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), respectively. Using this cDNA as a probe, we isolated and sequenced the corresponding genomic clone. Comparison of the sequences of the cDNA and the genomic gene revealed that the coding region of the gene was interrupted by 14 introns 66 to 1547 bp long. Northern and western blotting analyses showed that the gene was expressed at high levels in developing seeds. When the 5'-flanking region between -930 and +85 from the site of initiation of transcription was fused to a reporter gene for beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and then introduced into the rice genome, histochemical staining revealed strong GUS activity in the inner endosperm tissue of developing seeds and weak activity in root tips. Similar tissue-specific expression was also detected by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed.
10660065	Molecular analysis of the NAC gene family in rice.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	Genes that encode products containing a NAC domain, such as NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) in petunia, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) and NAP in Arabidopsis thaliana, have crucial functions in plant development. We describe here molecular aspects of the OsNAC genes that encode proteins with NAC domains in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sequence analysis revealed that the NAC genes in plants can be divided into several subfamilies, such as the NAM, ATAF, and OsNAC3 subfamilies. In rice, OsNAC1 and OsNAC2 are classified in the NAM subfamily, which includes NAM and CUC2, while OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 fall into the ATAF subfamily. In addition to the members of these subfamilies, the rice genome contains the NAC genes OsNAC3, OsNAC4 (both in the OsNAC3 subfamily), OsNAC7, and OsNAC8. These results and Southern analysis indicate that the OsNAC genes constitute a large gene family in the rice genome. Each OsNAC gene is expressed in a specific pattern in different organs, suggesting that this family has diverse and important roles in rice development.
12520303	The plant MITE mPing is mobilized in anther culture.	2003	Nature	Transposable elements constitute a large portion of eukaryotic genomes and contribute to their evolution and diversification. Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) constitute one of the main groups of transposable elements and are distributed ubiquitously in the genomes of plants and animals such as maize, rice, Arabidopsis, human, insect and nematode. Because active MITEs have not been identified, the transposition mechanism of MITEs and their accumulation in eukaryotic genomes remain poorly understood. Here we describe a new class of MITE, called miniature Ping (mPing), in the genome of Oryza sativa (rice). mPing elements are activated in cells derived from anther culture, where they are excised efficiently from original sites and reinserted into new loci. An mPing-associated Ping element, which has a putative PIF family transposase, is implicated in the recent proliferation of this MITE family in a subspecies of rice.
3481021	Variable copy number DNA sequences in rice.	1987	Mol Gen Genet	We have cloned two types of variable copy number DNA sequences from the rice embryo genome. One of these sequences, which was cloned in pRB301, was amplified about 50-fold during callus formation and diminished in copy number to the embryonic level during regeneration. The other clone, named pRB401, showed the reciprocal pattern. The copy numbers of both sequences were changed even in the early developmental stage and eliminated from nuclear DNA along with growth of the plant. Sequencing analysis of the pRB301 insert revealed some open reading frames and direct repeat structures, but corresponding sequences were not identified in the EMBL and LASL DNA databases. Sequencing of the nuclear genomic fragment cloned in pRB401 revealed the presence of the 3'rps12-rps7 region of rice chloroplast DNA. Our observations suggest that during callus formation (dedifferentiation), regeneration and the growth process the copy numbers of some DNA sequences are variable and that nuclear integrated chloroplast DNA acts as a variable copy number sequence in the rice genome. Based on data showing a common sequence in mitochondria and chloroplast DNA of maize (Stern and Lonsdale 1982) and that the rps12 gene of tobacco chloroplast DNA is a divided gene (Torazawa et al. 1986), it is suggested that the sequence on the inverted repeat structure of chloroplast DNA may have the character of a movable genetic element.
9617819	A new class II rice chitinase, Rcht2, whose induction by fungal elicitor is abolished by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	Among the four classes of chitinase, a class II chitinase had not yet been reported for rice. We have isolated and characterized a class II acidic chitinase, Rcht2, from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Cheongcheongbyeo). The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 261 amino acid residues and includes a putative signal sequence of 29 amino acids at its N-terminus. It has a calculated molecular mass of 27,642 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.56. The Rcht2 chitinase lacks the cysteine-rich and hinge domains in the N-terminal region of the protein, which is the criterion for its classification as a class II chitinase. Comparison of the genomic and the cDNA sequence revealed that the coding region of Rcht2 consist of three exons of 301, 112, and 370 bp separated by two introns of 89 and 984 bp. In suspension-cultured rice cells, the transcript level of Rcht2 was dramatically increased by treatment with both glycol chitin and fungal elicitor. The application of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors, calyculin A and okadaic acid, effectively abolished the induction of Rcht2 in response to fungal elicitor. In contrast, the activation of Rcht2 transcript was not inhibited by both cycloheximide and protein kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that protein dephosphorylation events play a crucial role in the elicitor-mediated induction of Rcht2 in rice cells, while de novo protein synthesis is not required for induction.

8219074	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA encodes a protein sequence homologous to the eukaryotic ribosomal 5S RNA-binding protein.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA clone coding for the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein L5, which associates with 5 S rRNA for ribosome assembly, was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The primary structure of rice L5, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, contains 294 amino acids and has intriguing features some of which are also conserved in other eucaryotic homologues. These include: four clusters of basic amino acids, one of which may serve as a nucleolar localization signal; three repeated amino acid sequences; the conservation of glycine residues. This protein was identified as the nuclear-encoded cytoplasmic ribosomal protein L5 of rice by sequence similarity to other eucaryotic ribosomal 5 S RNA-binding proteins of rat, chicken, Xenopus laevis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rice L5 shares 51 to 62% amino acid sequence identity with the homologues. A group of ribosomal proteins from archaebacteria including Methanococcus vanniellii L18 and Halobacterium cutirubrum L13, which are known to be associated with 5 S rRNA, also related to rice L5 and the other eucaryotic counterparts, suggesting an evolutionary relationship in these ribosomal 5 S RNA-binding proteins.
1375314	Regulation and interaction of multiple protein factors with the proximal promoter regions of a rice high pI alpha-amylase gene.	1992	Mol Gen Genet	The alpha-amylase gene is known to be regulated by the plant hormone gibberellin (GA) in cereal aleurone cells. The accumulation of the mRNA corresponding to a rice high pI alpha-amylase gene, OSamy-c, was stimulated 20-fold by exogenous GA3 in half-seeds lacking embryos. Regulatory regions in the promoter of this high pI sub-family were analyzed. The OSamy-c 5' flanking sequence, spanning positions -231 to +29, was fused upstream of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene coding region. The delivery of this plasmid into rice aleurone cells by the biolistic method resulted in a GA-stimulated synthesis of GUS. Gel retardation assays were performed to study protein-DNA interactions between putative regulatory sequences of OSamy-c and partially purified rice seed extracts. We identified multiple seed-specific protein factors that bind to proximal regions of the OSamy-c promoter between positions -231 and -162. Five different proteins were distinguished based on competitive binding studies. Three protein binding regions were located by footprinting analyses, one of which is located in the conserved sequence also found upstream of other GA-inducible genes. Two protein factors in rice aleurone cells that interact with the putative regulatory sequence do not require GA induction.
14682618	Isolation and characterization of a novel rice Ca2+-regulated protein kinase gene involved in responses to diverse signals including cold, light, cytokinins, sugars and salts.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated a cold-inducible gene (designated OsCK1) from Oryza sativa by a differential cDNA screening technique. Sequence analysis indicated that the open reading frame of the OsCK1 gene consists of 1350 bp encoding 449 amino acid residues, which is very similar to a family of calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) or salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2)-like protein kinases (PKS) in Arabidopsis. CIPKs/PKS are a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases associated with the AtCBL/SOS3-like calcium-binding proteins (SCaBP). OsCK1 actually interacts with AtCBL3 through the C-terminal region in a yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that OsCK1 is probably a rice orthologue of one of the CIPK/PKS members. Expression of the OsCK1 gene was detected mainly in the shoots and highly inducible by diverse signals such as cold, light, salt, sugar and cytokinins. In addition, calcium increased the OsCK1 transcript level, whereas a calcium ionophore, A23187, partially abolished stimulus-induced expressions. OsCK1 phosphorylated itself and a generic substrate, myelin basic protein, in the preference of Mn2+. Deletion of the C-terminal region from OsCK1 significantly decreased autophosphorylation activity without affecting the ability for substrate phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the CBL/CIPK or SCaBP/PKS signaling pathways recently found in Arabidopsis may also exist in rice and function in cold response in which calcium signal serves as a second messenger.
11919636	Calmodulin interacts with MLO protein to regulate defence against mildew in barley.	2002	Nature	In plants, defence against specific isolates of a pathogen can be triggered by the presence of a corresponding race-specific resistance gene, whereas resistance of a more broad-spectrum nature can result from recessive, presumably loss-of-regulatory-function, mutations. An example of the latter are mlo mutations in barley, which have been successful in agriculture for the control of powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei; Bgh). MLO protein resides in the plasma membrane, has seven transmembrane domains, and is the prototype of a sequence-diversified family unique to plants, reminiscent of the seven-transmembrane receptors in fungi and animals. In animals, these are known as G-protein-coupled receptors and exist in three main families, lacking sequence similarity, that are thought to be an example of molecular convergence. MLO seems to function independently of heterotrimeric G proteins. We have identified a domain in MLO that mediates a Ca2+-dependent interaction with calmodulin in vitro. Loss of calmodulin binding halves the ability of MLO to negatively regulate defence against powdery mildew in vivo. We propose a sensor role for MLO in the modulation of defence reactions.
12423882	alpha-Galactosidase from cultured rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare) cells.	2002	Phytochemistry	The alpha-galactosidase from rice cell suspension cultures was purified to homogeneity by different techniques including affinity chromatography using N-epsilon-aminocaproyl-alpha-D-galactopyranosylamine as the ligand. From 11 l of culture filtrate, 28.7 mg of purified enzyme was obtained with an overall yield of 51.9%. The cDNA coding for the alpha-galactosidase was cloned and sequenced. The enzyme was found to contain 417 amino acid residues composed of a 55 amino acid signal sequence and 362 amino acid mature alpha-galactosidase; the molecular weight of the mature enzyme was thus calculated to be 39,950. Seven cysteine residues were also found but no putative N-glycosylation sites were present. The observed homology between the deduced amino acid sequences of the mature enzyme and alpha-galactosidases from coffee (Coffea arabica), guar (Cyamopsis tetragonolooba), and Mortierella vinacea alpha-galactosidase II were over 73, 72, and 45%, respectively. The enzyme displayed maximum activity at 45 degrees C when p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside was used as substrate. The rice alpha-galactosidase and Mortierella vinacea alpha-galactosidase II acted on both the terminal alpha-galactosyl residue and the side-chain alpha-galactosyl residue of the galactomanno-oligosaccharides.
3360138	Nucleotide and primary sequence of a major rice prolamine.	1988	FEBS Lett	A recombinant cDNA clone encoding a major rice seed storage prolamine was isolated by antibody screening of a cDNA lambda gt 11 library. This clone contained a single open reading frame encoding a putative rice prolamine precursor (Mr 17,300). In contrast to other cereal prolamines, the primary sequence of the rice prolamine was devoid of any major tandem repetitive sequences, a feature prevalent in all cereal prolamines studied to date. No significant homology was detected between the rice prolamine and other cereal prolamines, indicating that the rice gene evolved from unique ancestral DNA segments.
16666363	Structure, expression, and heterogeneity of the rice seed prolamines.	1988	Plant Physiol	By screening two rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed cDNA libraries, recombinant cDNA clones encoding the rice prolamine seed storage protein were isolated. Based on cross-hybridization and restriction enzyme map analyses, these clones can be divided into two homology classes. All clones contain a single open reading frame encoding a putative rice prolamine precursor (molecular weight = 17,200) possessing a typical 14-amino acid signal peptide. The deduced primary structures of both types of prolamine polypeptides are devoid of repetitive sequences, a feature prevalent in other cereal prolamines. Clones of these two homology classes diverge mainly by insertions/deletions of short nucleotide stretches and point mutations. An isolated genomic clone about 15.5 kilobases in length displays a highly conserved 2.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment, repeated in tandem four times, each containing the prolamine coding sequence. Close homology is exhibited by the coding segments of the genomic and cDNA sequences, although the 5' ends of the untranslated regions are widely divergent. The sequence heterogeneity displayed by these genomic and cDNA clones and large gene copy number ( approximately 80-100 copies/haploid genome) indicate that the rice prolamines are encoded by a complex multigene family.
10592042	Characterization of two fungal-elicitor-induced rice cDNAs encoding functional homologues of the rab-specific GDP-dissociation inhibitor.	1999	Planta	By using the mRNA differential display approach to isolate defense signaling genes active at the early stage of fungal infection two cDNA fragments with high sequence homology to rab-specific GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) were identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.) suspension cells. Using polymerase-chain-reaction products as probes, two full-length cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library of fungal-elicitor-treated rice, and designated as OsGDI1 and OsGDI2. The deduced amino acid sequences of the isolated cDNAs exhibited substantial homology to Arabidopsis rab-GDIs. Northern analysis revealed that transcripts detected with the 3'-gene-specific DNA probes accumulated to high levels within 30 min after treatment with a fungal elicitor derived from Magnaporthe grisea. The functionality of the OsGDIs was demonstrated by their ability to rescue the Sec19 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is defective in vesicle transport. The proteins, expressed in Escherchia coli, cross-reacted with a polyclonal antibody prepared against bovine rab-GDI. Like bovine rab-GDI, the OsGDI proteins efficiently dissociated rab3A from bovine synaptic membranes. Using the two-hybrid system, it was shown that the OsGDIs specifically interact with the small GTP-binding proteins belonging to the rab subfamily. The specific interaction was also demonstrated in vitro by glutathione S-transferase resin pull-down assay.
7765038	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding class I chitinase in suspension cultures of rice cell.	1994	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequences of full-length cDNA clones for chitinase, CH6 and CH16, whose sizes were about 1.1 kb with signal peptides, from rice cell suspension cultures. Northern blot analysis with CH16 as a probe showed that the chitinase transcript reached maximum at 8 h after elicitor-treatment and their sizes were about 1.1 kb, demonstrating that these clones were induced by elicitor.
7991693	Isolation and characterization of a rice full-length cDNA clone encoding a polyubiquitin.	1994	Plant Physiol	
10996242	Molecular cloning and characterization of a plant homologue of the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1).	2000	Plant Sci	By using the rice EST database, we have isolated a 2.8 kb cDNA, termed Oryza sativa ORC1 (OsORC1), from rice (O. sativa) encoding a protein that shows homology with the eukaryotic ORC1 proteins. Alignment of the OsORC1 protein sequence with the sequence of ORC1 from human and yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe showed a high degree of sequence homology (38.7, 32.9 and 35.0% identity, respectively), particularly around the C-terminal region containing the CDC-NTP domain. Interestingly, the OsORC1 protein had an A+T hook-like motif, which was not present in the human or yeast genes. Genomic analysis indicated that OsORC1 existed as a single copy per genome. OsORC1 transcripts were expressed strongly in root tips and weakly in young leaves containing root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively. No expression was detected in the mature leaves. The level of OsORC1 expression was significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium. When the growth-halted cells began to re-grow following addition of sucrose to the medium, OsORC1 was again expressed at high levels. These results suggested that OsORC1 is required for cell proliferation. The role of OsORC1 in plant DNA replication will be discussed.
10798612	Plant homologue of flap endonuclease-1: molecular cloning, characterization, and evidence of expression in meristematic tissues.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is an important enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. We isolated a 1.4 kb cDNA from rice (Oryza sativa), termed OsFEN-1, encoding a protein which shows homology with the eukaryotic FEN-1 proteins. OsFEN-1 protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. DNA cleavage analysis using different branched DNA structures indicated that OsFEN-1 protein possesses both 5'-flap endonuclease and 5' to 3' double-stranded DNA exonuclease activities. OsFEN-1 protein incises a 5'-flap and 5'-pseudo Y structure one base 3' of the branched point in the duplex region. The enzymatic properties indicated that we succeeded in obtaining the gene and the protein of a plant counterpart of FEN-1. OsFEN-1 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as root tips and young leaves that contain root apical meristem and marginal meristem, respectively. No expression was detected in mature leaves although the leaves were exposed to UV. We analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of OsFEN-1 transcripts by in situ hybridization. In the shoot apex, OsFEN-1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem, tiller bud, leaf primordia, ligule primordia and marginal meristem of young leaves. In the roots, the transcript accumulated to high levels in the root apical meristem. Our results indicate that OsFEN-1 is expressed in tissues rich in proliferating cells, and its expression may be required for cell growth and organ formation.
11917019	A novel DNA polymerase homologous to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2002	Nucleic Acids Res	A novel DNA polymerase, designated as OsPolI-like, has been identified from the higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The OsPolI-like cDNA was 3765 bp in length, and the open reading frame encoded a predicted product of 977 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 100 kDa. The OsPolI-like gene has been mapped to chromosome 8 and contains 12 exons and 11 introns. The encoded protein showed a high degree of sequence and structural homology to Escherichia coli pol I protein, but differed from DNA polymerase gamma and theta. The DNA polymerase domain of OsPolI-like showed DNA polymerase activity. Subcellular fractionation analysis suggested that the protein is localized in the plastid. Northern and western blotting, and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated preferential expression of OsPolI-like in meristematic tissues such as shoot apical meristem, root apical meristem, leaf primordia and the marginal meristem. Interestingly, no expression was detected in mature leaves, although they have a high chloroplast content. These properties indicated that OsPolI-like is a novel plant DNA polymerase. The function of OsPolI-like is discussed in relation to plastid maturation.
14527718	Functional characterization of two flap endonuclease-1 homologues in rice.	2003	Gene	Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is an important enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. Previously, we isolated and characterized a complementary DNA (cDNA) from rice (Oryza sativa) encoding a protein which shows homology with the eukaryotic flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1). In this report, we found that rice (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) possessed two FEN-1 homologues designated as OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b. The OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b genes were mapped to chromosome 5 and 3, respectively. Both genes contained 17 exons and 16 introns. Alignment of OsFEN-1a protein with OsFEN-1b protein showed a high degree of sequence similarity, particularly around the N and I domains. Northern hybridization and in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated preferential expression of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b in proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem or young leaves. The levels of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b expression were significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium. When the growth-halted cells began to regrow following the addition of sucrose to the medium, both OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b were again expressed at high level. These results suggested that OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b are required for cell proliferation. Functional complementation assay suggested that OsFEN-1a cDNA had the ability to complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad27 null mutant. On the other hand, OsFEN-1b cDNA could not complement the rad27 mutant. The roles of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b in plant DNA replication and repair are discussed.
15150342	DNA repair in higher plants; photoreactivation is the major DNA repair pathway in non-proliferating cells while excision repair (nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair) is active in proliferating cells.	2004	Nucleic Acids Res	We investigated expression patterns of DNA repair genes such as the CPD photolyase, UV-DDB1, CSB, PCNA, RPA32 and FEN-1 genes by northern hybridization analysis and in situ hybridization using a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). We found that all the genes tested were expressed in tissues rich in proliferating cells, but only CPD photolyase was expressed in non-proliferating tissue such as the mature leaves and elongation zone of root. The removal of DNA damage, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts, in both mature leaves and the root apical meristem (RAM) was observed after UV irradiation under light. In the dark, DNA damage in mature leaves was not repaired efficiently, but that in the RAM was removed rapidly. Using a rice 22K custom oligo DNA microarray, we compared global gene expression patterns in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and mature leaves. Most of the excision repair genes were more strongly expressed in SAM. These results suggested that photoreactivation is the major DNA repair pathway for the major UV-induced damage in non-proliferating cells, while both photoreactivation and excision repair are active in proliferating cells.
15541369	RERJ1, a jasmonic acid-responsive gene from rice, encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein.	2004	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with jasmonic acid (JA) for 1/2h yielded a cDNA of a gene tentatively named RERJ1 that is upregulated in response to exogenous JA. Northern blot analysis indicated that the RERJ1 mRNA levels peaked at 1/2-1h after the addition of jasmonic acid and then decreased gradually. RERJ1 encodes a transcriptional regulator with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing sense or antisense RERJ1 mRNA demonstrated that RERJ1 is involved in the growth inhibition of rice shoots caused by JA. Other biological functions of RERJ1 are discussed from an evolutionary standpoint.
15084714	Differential activation of the rice sucrose nonfermenting1-related protein kinase2 family by hyperosmotic stress and abscisic acid.	2004	Plant Cell	To date, a large number of sequences of protein kinases that belong to the sucrose nonfermenting1-related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family are found in databases. However, only limited numbers of the family members have been characterized and implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) and hyperosmotic stress signaling. We identified 10 SnRK2 protein kinases encoded by the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Each of the 10 members was expressed in cultured cell protoplasts, and its regulation was analyzed. Here, we demonstrate that all family members are activated by hyperosmotic stress and that three of them are also activated by ABA. Surprisingly, there were no members that were activated only by ABA. The activation was found to be regulated via phosphorylation. In addition to the functional distinction with respect to ABA regulation, dependence of activation on the hyperosmotic strength was different among the members. We show that the relatively diverged C-terminal domain is mainly responsible for this functional distinction, although the kinase domain also contributes to these differences. The results indicated that the SnRK2 protein kinase family has evolved specifically for hyperosmotic stress signaling and that individual members have acquired distinct regulatory properties, including ABA responsiveness by modifying the C-terminal domain.
9049269	Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase.	1997	Plant Mol Biol	The omega-3 fatty acid desaturases are membrane-bound enzymes catalyzing the conversion of linoleic acid to linolenic acid in lipids, and are located both in the microsome and plastid envelopes as two different isoforms. A cDNA encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (OsFAD3) and the corresponding genomic clone were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The OsFAD3 gene was composed of 8 exons and 7 introns. A microsatellite was present in the second exon of the OsFAD3 gene, showing polymorphism between Indica and Japonica rice varieties. The mapping of this microsatellite showed that the OsFAD3 gene was located on chromosome 11. Expression of the OsFAD3 cDNA in tobacco hairy root tissues and subsequent analysis of fatty acid compositions demonstrated the activity of the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. The OsFAD3 mRNA was abundant in root tissues, but was hardly detectable in leaves. In root tissues, a high level of the OsFAD3 mRNA was observed at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with its level decreasing markedly at temperatures below 10 degrees C. The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures. Similar temperature responses of the OsFAD3 gene were observed both in chilling- tolerant and in chilling-intolerant rice cultivars.
7788525	cDNA sequences of three kinds of beta-tubulins from rice.	1995	DNA Res	Complete nucleotide sequences of three kinds of rice beta-tubulin cDNA clones (pTUB22, R1623 and R2242) were determined. Southern hybridization indicated that these beta-tubulins consist of one gene family. Using RFLP mapping, these three beta-tubulin cDNAs were mapped to different chromosomes indicating at least three loci for the beta-tubulin gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNAs showed a high similarity to other plant beta-tubulins. The asparagine residue located at the 100th amino acid from the N-terminus of plant beta-tubulins was also conserved with these three beta-tubulins. This asparagine is thought to be responsible for the sensitivity against rhizoxin, the toxin of the pathogen of rice seedling blight, Rhizopus sp. a soil-borne microorganism. Expression of the three beta-tubulin genes was analyzed by Northern blotting and all three clones were expressed in root, the possible target tissue of rhizoxin. These results suggest that these clones are candidates of beta-tubulins targeted by rhizoxin.
13130077	LAX and SPA: major regulators of shoot branching in rice.	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The aerial architecture of plants is determined primarily by the pattern of shoot branching. Although shoot apical meristem initiation during embryogenesis has been extensively studied by molecular genetic approaches using Arabidopsis, little is known about the genetic mechanisms controlling axillary meristem initiation, mainly because of the insufficient number of mutants that specifically alter it. We identified the LAX PANICLE (LAX) and SMALL PANICLE (SPA) genes as the main regulators of axillary meristem formation in rice. LAX encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and the region of new meristem formation. This pattern of LAX expression was repeatedly observed in every axillary meristem, consistent with our observation that LAX is involved in the formation of all types of axillary meristems throughout the ontogeny of a rice plant. Ectopic LAX expression in rice caused pleiotropic effects, including dwarfing, an altered pattern of stem elongation, darker color, bending of the lamina joint, absence of the midribs of leaves, and severe sterility.
12835399	FRIZZY PANICLE is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems and to establish floral meristem identity in rice spikelets.	2003	Development	Inflorescences of grass species have a distinct morphology in which florets are grouped in compact branches called spikelets. Although many studies have shown that the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control floret organ formation are conserved between monocots and dicots, little is known about the genetic pathway leading to spikelet formation. In the frizzy panicle (fzp) mutant of rice, the formation of florets is replaced by sequential rounds of branching. Detailed analyses revealed that several rudimentary glumes are formed in each ectopic branch, indicating that meristems acquire spikelet identity. However, instead of proceeding to floret formation, axillary meristems are formed in the axils of rudimentary glumes and they either arrest or develop into branches of higher order. The fzp mutant phenotype suggests that FZP is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems within the spikelet meristem and permit the subsequent establishment of floral meristem identity. The FZP gene was isolated by transposon tagging. FZP encodes an ERF transcription factor and is the rice ortholog of the maize BD1 gene. Consistent with observations from phenotypic analyses, FZP expression was found to be restricted to the time of rudimentary glumes differentiation in a half-ring domain at the base of which the rudimentary glume primordium emerged.
12897263	Two-step regulation and continuous retrotransposition of the rice LINE-type retrotransposon Karma.	2003	Plant Cell	Here, we report the identification of Karma, a LINE-type retrotransposon of plants for which continuous retrotransposition was observed in consecutive generations. The transcription of Karma is activated in cultured cells of rice upon DNA hypomethylation. However, transcription is insufficient for retrotransposition, because no increase in the copy number was observed in cultured cells or in the first generation of plants regenerated from them. Despite that finding, copy number increase was detected in the next generation of regenerated plants as well as in later generations, suggesting that the post-transcriptional regulation of Karma retrotransposition is development dependent. Our results indicate that two different mechanisms, one transcriptional and the other developmental, control the mobilization of KARMA: In addition, unlike other known active plant retrotransposons, Karma is not subject to de novo methylation, and retrotransposition persists through several generations.
14731253	Map-based cloning of a fertility restorer gene, Rf-1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2004	Plant J	A rice nuclear gene, Rf-1, restores the pollen fertility disturbed by the BT-type male sterile cytoplasm, and is widely used for commercial seed production of japonica hybrid varieties. Genomic fragments carrying Rf-1 were identified by conducting chromosome walking and a series of complementation tests. Isolation and analysis of cDNA clones corresponding to the fragments demonstrated that Rf-1 encodes a mitochondrially targeted protein containing 16 repeats of the 35-aa pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif. Sequence analysis revealed that the recessive allele, rf-1, lacks one nucleotide in the putative coding region, presumably resulting in encoding a truncated protein because of a frame shift. Rice Rf-1 is the first restorer gene isolated from cereal crops that has the property of reducing the expression of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)-associated mitochondrial gene like many other restorer genes. The present findings may facilitate not only elucidating the mechanisms of male sterility by the BT cytoplasm and its restoration by Rf-1 but also isolating other restorer genes from cereal crops, especially rice.
2806916	Cloning and sequence analysis of the genomic DNA fragment encoding oryzacystatin.	1989	Gene	A genomic DNA clone encoding oryzacystatin (Oc), a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) of rice, was isolated from a lambda EMBL3 phage library constructed with Sau3AI partial digests of rice chromosomal DNA, by screening with an oc cDNA as a probe. The restriction map of the isolated DNA fragment was consistent with the pattern of the genomic Southern-blot analysis using a cDNA probe, and consequently, the gene is considered to be a single-copy gene. The oc gene is about 1.4 kb long and composed of three exons and two introns. The first intron (336 bp) intervenes between Ala-38 and Asp-39. The second intron (372 bp) exists in the 3'-noncoding region at the G residue next to the stop codon. S1 nuclease mapping showed the major transcription start point (tsp) at A, 104 bp upstream from the start codon (ATG). Typical CAT and TATA box sequences were found in the 5'-upstream region of the tsp. The nucleotide sequences around the TATA box, the tsp, the start codon, and the stop codon essentially matched the consensus sequences of other higher plant genes. The intron boundaries of the oc gene were quite different from those of the human kininogen-encoding gene and the human salivary cystatin (cystatin S)-encoding gene.
1697595	Two distinct cystatin species in rice seeds with different specificities against cysteine proteinases. Molecular cloning, expression, and biochemical studies on oryzacystatin-II.	1990	J Biol Chem	Oryzacystatin (oryzacystatin-I) is a proteinaceous cysteine proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) in rice seeds and is the first well defined cystatin of plant origin. In this study we isolated cDNA clones for a new type of cystatin (oryzacystatin-II) in rice seeds by screening with the oryzacystatin-I cDNA probe. The newly isolated cDNA clone encodes 107 amino acid residues whose sequence is similar to that of oryzacystatin-I (approximately 55% of identity). These oryzacystatins have no disulfide bonds, and so could be classified as family-I cystatins; however, the amino acid sequences resemble those of family-II members more than family-I members. Oryzacystatin-I and -II are remarkably distinct in two respects: 1) their specificities against cysteine proteinases; and 2) the expression patterns of their mRNAs in the ripening stage of rice seeds. Oryzacystatin-I inhibits papain more effectively (Ki 3.0 x 10(-8) M) than cathepsin H (Ki 0.79 x 10(-6) M), while oryzacystatin-II inhibits cathepsin H (Ki 1.0 x 10(-8) M) better than papain (Ki 0.83 x 10(-6) M). The mRNA for oryzacystatin-I is expressed maximally at 2 weeks after flowering and is not detected in mature seeds, whereas the mRNA for oryzacystatin-II is constantly expressed throughout the maturation stages and is clearly detected in mature seeds. Western blotting analysis using antibody to oryzacystatin-II showed that, as is the case with oryzacystatin-I, oryzacystatin-II occurs in mature rice seeds. Thus, these two oryzacystatin species are believed to be involved in the regulation of proteolysis caused by different proteinases.
1993479	Gene organization of oryzacystatin-II, a new cystatin superfamily member of plant origin, is closely related to that of oryzacystatin-I but different from those of animal cystatins.	1991	FEBS Lett	The gene structure of oryzacystatin-II, a new cystatin superfamily member of rice seed origin, was determined. It spans approximately 2.5 kbp and comprises 3 exons. The number of exons and the intron-breakpoints coincide with those of oryzacystatin-I, the first well-defined plant cystatin. However, no similar sequences were observed between the two oryzacystatin genes in 5'-upstream regulatory regions, even though both are expressed specifically during the ripening stage of rice seeds. The gene organization of these two plant cystatins is generally different from that of animal cystatins.
12669200	A new AOX homologous gene OsIM1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.) with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	A differentially expressed OsIM1 gene was isolated from rice salt-tolerant mutant M-20 by differential display. Sequence analysis revealed that the amino-acid sequence of OsIM1 showed 66% and 62% identity with PTOX from tomato ( Capsicum annuum) and AtIM from Arabidopsis, both of which encoded chloroplast-orientated terminal oxidase. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the OsIM1 cDNA with its genomic sequence revealed that OsIM1 genomic DNA contained nine exons and eight introns. A pseudo-transcript ( OsIM2), which probably resulted from the abnormal splicing of the OsIM1 pre-mRNA, was also identified. Southern-blot analysis showed that there existed only one copy of the OsIM1 gene in the rice genome. RFLP analysis located it on rice chromosome 3. The Northern blot revealed that OsIM1 was up-regulated by NaCl and ABA treatment. RT-PCR analysis indicated that OsIM1 and OsIM2 co-existed in the OsIM transcript pool, and the ratio of OsIM1/ OsIM2 was differentially regulated by salt stress in the salt-sensitive variety and the salt-tolerant varieties.
10625676	Identification, cloning, and properties of cytosolic D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase from higher plants.	2000	J Biol Chem	Plant cells contain a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the chloroplasts, but an incomplete pathway was proposed to be present in the cytosol, with cytosolic (cyt) isoforms of ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPEase) and other non-oxidative branch enzymes being undetectable. Here we present for the first time the identification, cloning, and properties of a cyt-RPEase in rice (Oryza sativa) and presence of its homologues in other plant species. Recombinant cyt-RPEase is a homodimer of 24.3-kDa subunits such as in the case of the animal and yeast enzymes, whereas the chloroplast (chl) RPEase is a hexamer. Cytosolic and chloroplastic RPEases cannot be separated by anion exchange chromatography. Since plant cyt-RPEase is more closely related in its primary structure to homologous enzymes in animal and yeast cells than to the chloroplast RPEase, the plant nuclear genes coding for cytosolic and chloroplast RPEases were most likely derived from eubacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively. Accumulation of cyt-RPEase-mRNA and protein is high in root cells, lacking chl-RPEase, and lower in green tissue. These and other observations support the view that green and non-green plant cells possess a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol.
9338963	PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene.	1997	Plant Cell	We have previously defined the promoter elements, sites IIa and IIb, in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene that are essential for meristematic tissue-specific expression. In this study, we isolated and characterized cDNAs encoding proteins that specifically bind to sites IIa and IIb. The two DNA binding proteins, designated PCF1 and PCF2, share > 70% homology in common conserved sequences at the N-terminal regions. The conserved regions are responsible for DNA binding and homodimer and heterodimer formation, and they contain a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif. The structure and DNA binding specificity of the bHLH motif are distinguishable from those of other known bHLH proteins that bind to the E-box. The motif is > 70% homologous to several expressed sequence tags from Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that PCF1 and PCF2 are members of a novel family of proteins that are conserved in monocotyledons and dicotyledons. A supershift assay using an anti-PCF2 antibody showed the involvement of PCF2 in site IIa (site IIb) binding activities in rice nuclear extracts, particularly in meristematic tissues. PCF1 and PCF2 were also more likely to form heterodimers than homodimers. Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers.
12000681	DNA binding and dimerization specificity and potential targets for the TCP protein family.	2002	Plant J	The TCP domain is a plant-specific DNA binding domain found in proteins from a diverse array of species, including the cycloidea (cyc) and teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene products and the PCF1 and PCF2 proteins. To understand the role in transcriptional regulation of proteins with this domain, we have analysed the DNA binding and dimerization specificity of the TCP protein family using rice PCF proteins, and further evaluated potential targets for the TCP protein. The seven PCF members including five newly isolated proteins, were able to be grouped into two classes, I and II, based on sequence similarity in the TCP domain. Random binding site selection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the consensus DNA binding sequences of these two classes to be distinct but overlapping; GGNCCCAC for class I and GTGGNCCC for class II. The TB1 protein from maize, which belongs to class II, had the same specificity as the rice class II proteins, suggesting the conservation of binding specificity between TCP domains from different species. The yeast 2-hybrid assay and EMSA revealed that these proteins tend to form a homodimer or a heterodimer between members of the same class. We searched predicted 5' flanking sequences of Arabidopsis genes for the consensus binding sequences and found that the consensus sites are distributed in the genome at a considerably lower frequency. We further analysed eight promoters containing the class I consensus TCP sites. The transcriptional activities of six promoters were decreased by a mutation of the TCP binding site, which is consistent with the observation that the class I TCP site can confer transactivation function on a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that the two classes of TCP protein are distinct in DNA binding specificity and transcriptional regulation.
12060226	E2F sites that can interact with E2F proteins cloned from rice are required for meristematic tissue-specific expression of rice and tobacco proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoters.	2002	Plant J	Plants have recently been found to have E2F-like and Rb-like proteins, regulators responsible for the G1(G0)-S phase transition of the cell cycle in animals. Here we show that E2F is involved in transcription of plant genes for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is required for DNA replication. Potential E2F binding sites found in the rice PCNA promoters mediated transcriptional activation in actively dividing cells and tissues of tobacco, but not transcriptional repression in terminally differentiated tissues, as also observed for the PCF binding sites previously found in the rice promoter. Similar results were obtained from analyses for a PCNA promoter isolated from tobacco, which contained two E2F-like sites, each with a different degree of contribution to the promoter activation. These E2F-like sites except for a rice site were indeed bound specifically by recombinant proteins of rice E2F, OsE2F1 and OsE2F2, and complexes of OsE2F1 with Arabidopsis DP proteins. Furthermore, OsE2F1 had the ability to transactivate an E2F-reporter gene containing the tobacco E2F site on co-expression with an Arabidopsis DP, and the transactivation was greatly enhanced by tagging a canonical nuclear localization signal to OsE2F1, suggesting a nuclear import-mediated regulation of the OsE2F1 function. In addition, we found that a large number of replication- and mismatch repair-associated genes in Arabidopsis contain E2F binding sequences conserved in their predicted promoter regions.
10363365	Rice ENOD40: isolation and expression analysis in rice and transgenic soybean root nodules.	1999	Plant J	The early nodulin ENOD40 has been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the organogenesis of legume root nodules. We have isolated the ENOD40 gene homologues ObENOD40 and OsENOD40 from the wild and cultivated rice genotypes Oryza brachyantha and Oryza sativa, respectively. Rice ENOD40s contain a sequence at the 5' end (region I) for encoding an oligopeptide that is highly conserved in all legume ENOD40s. Furthermore, at the 3' end (region II), the nucleotide sequence of rice ENOD40s exhibited a considerable homology to the corresponding region in legume ENOD40s. Among various organs of the rice plant, expression of OsENOD40 was detected only in stems. In situ hybridization studies revealed that, within the stem, transcription of OsENOD40 is confined to parenchyma cells surrounding the protoxylem during the early stages of development of lateral vascular bundles that conjoin an emerging leaf. Expression pattern of OsENOD40 promoter-GUS fusion in nodules developed on transgenic hairy roots of soybean was also found to be restricted to peripheral cells of nodule vascular bundles, thus evidencing that rice ENOD40 promoter activity is essentially the same as that of soybean ENOD40. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsENOD40 and legume ENOD40s share common, if not identical, functions in differentiation and/or function of vascular bundles.
8921376	The organization of the human gene NCX1 encoding the sodium-calcium exchanger.	1996	Genomics	The intron-exon organization of the human Na/Ca-exchanger gene NCX1 and of the N-terminal half of the related gene NCX2 has been determined. The NCX1 gene consists of 12 exons spread over 200 kb on chromosome 2 close to STS D2S2328 and encodes a 6.2-kb transcript. Both NCX1 and NCX2 feature an unusual 1.8-kb exon, containing two-thirds of the protein coding sequence and a similar area of the coding sequences split into several small exons, displaying tissue-specific alternative splicing. The similar intron positions in the "cardiac" (NCX1) and "brain" (NCX2) mammalian exchanger genes suggest their origin from the recent duplication and translocation of a common ancestral gene, a putative precursor of which has been identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
8503935	Nucleotide sequence of an abundant rice seed globulin: homology with the high molecular weight glutelins of wheat, rye and triticale.	1993	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A cDNA clone corresponding to a 19 kD salt-soluble globulin of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was isolated by screening a lambda gt11 expression library of endosperm mRNA with antibodies raised against the purified rice seed alpha-globulin. The cDNA contained a single large open reading frame encoding a putative globulin precursor of molecular weight of 21 kD. The polypeptide consists of 182 amino acids and is devoid of lysine residues. Computer analysis of the NH2-terminal sequence of the globulin precursor protein indicated the presence of an 18 amino acid signal peptide. Segments of the amino acid sequence of the rice globulin were homologous with sequences in high molecular weight glutelins of wheat. Antibodies specific for rice seed globulin also cross-reacted with seed proteins from wheat, rye and triticale.
9520275	The genomic organization of non-LTR retrotransposons (LINEs) from three Beta species and five other angiosperms.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated and characterized conserved regions of the reverse transcriptase gene from non-LTR retrotransposons, also called long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), from Beta vulgaris, B. lomatogona and B. nana. The novel elements show strong homology to other non-LTR retrotransposons from plants, man and animals. LINEs are present in all species of the genus Beta tested, but there was variation in copy number. Analysis by Southern hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed the clustered organization of these retroelements in beet species. PCR amplification using degenerate primers to conserved motifs of the predicted LINE protein sequence enabled the cloning of LINEs from both Monocotyledonae (Allium cepa, Oryza sativa and Secale cereale) and Dicotyledonae (Nicotiana tabacum and Antirrhinum majus) indicating that LINEs are a universal feature of plant genomes. A dendrogram of fifteen new and six previously isolated sequences showed the high level of sequence divergence while revealing families characteristic of some genera. The genomic organization of non-LTR retrotransposons was examined more detailed in A. majus and O. sativa.
10430921	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 (rps14), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons. A functional rps14 gene was isolated from the rice nuclear genome, suggesting a gene-transfer event from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. The nuclear rps14 gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) protein from human and a malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). Isolation of a functional rice sdhB cDNA and subsequent sequence comparison to the nuclear rps14 indicate that the 5' portions of the two cDNAs are identical. The sdhB genomic sequence shows that the SDHB-coding region is divided into two exons. Surprisingly, the RPS14-coding region is located between the two exons. DNA gel blot analysis indicates that both sdhB and rps14 are present at a single locus in the rice nucleus. These findings strongly suggest that the two gene transcripts result from a single mRNA precursor by alternative splicing. Protein blot analysis shows that the size of the mature RPS14 is 16.5 kDa, suggesting removal of the N-terminal 22.6-kDa peptide region. Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the rps14-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the rps14 gene. The migration of the mitochondrial rps14 sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting.
10852496	Transfer of the mitochondrial rps10 gene to the nucleus in rice: acquisition of the 5' untranslated region followed by gene duplication.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10 (rps10) is encoded by the mitochondrial genome in potato and pea. Here we show that the rps10 gene is absent from the mitochondrial genome of rice and has been transferred to the nucleus. Cloning and transcriptional analysis show that there are two rps10 genes in the rice nuclear genome and that their transcripts differ in abundance. Western analysis detected the RPS10 protein in the soluble fraction of rice mitochondria, although neither RPS10 has any obvious N-terminal presequence for targeting to mitochondria. This result suggests that targeting information is present in the internal region of rice RPS10. Genomic sequence analysis indicated that each rps10 gene has an intron in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and that these intron sequences are homologous to each other. This result strongly suggests that a duplication event occurred after transfer of the rps10 gene to the nucleus. The duplicated rps10 genes have since been translocated to different chromosomes, because the two rps10 genes were mapped on chromosomes 6 and 12 by RFLP analysis. Interestingly, the 5' UTR and the intron of the rice rps10 genes are homologous to sequences found in several rice genes with various functions, such as osk4, EF-1beta2 and RAG1, suggesting a common origin and a functional role for the 5' UTR. Acquisition of the 5' flanking region might have accelerated the activation of the mitochondrial rps10 gene which was transferred to the nuclear genome.
11418240	Mitochondrial sequence migrated downstream to a nuclear V-ATPase B gene is transcribed but non-functional.	2001	Gene	A promiscuous nuclear sequence containing a mitochondrial DNA fragment was isolated from rice. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the cDNA clone #21 carries a mitochondrial sequence homologous to the 3' portion of the rps19 gene followed by the 5' portion of the rps3 gene. The mitochondrial sequence is present in an antisense orientation. Sequence comparison of the #21 cDNA with the original mitochondrial sequence shows 99% similarity, suggesting a recent transfer event. Moreover, evidence for a lack of an RNA editing event and retaining of the group II intron sequence strongly suggests that the sequence was transferred from mitochondrion to the nucleus via DNA rather than RNA as an intermediate. The upstream region to the mitochondria-derived sequence shows homology to part of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase B subunit (V-ATPase B) gene. Isolation of a functional V-ATPase B cDNA and its comparison with the #21 cDNA reveal a number of nucleotide substitutions resulting in many translational stop codons in the #21 cDNA. This indicates that the #21 cDNA sequence is not functional. Analysis of genomic sequences shows the presence of five intron sequences in the #21 cDNA, whereas the functional V-ATPase B gene has 14 introns. Of these, three exons and their internal two introns are homologous to each other, suggesting a duplication event of V-ATPase B genomic DNA. The results of this investigation strongly suggest that the mitochondrial sequence was integrated in an antisense orientation into the pre-existing V-ATPase B pseudogene that can be transcribed and spliced. This represents a case of unsuccessful gene transfer from mitochondrion to the nucleus.
2258052	Expression and secretion of rice alpha-amylase by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	1990	Gene	We report the high level expression and secretion of rice alpha-amylase isozyme by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of this gene was under control of the yeast enolase promoter. The synthesized protein had an approximate molecular size of 45 kDa and a pI of approx 4.7 to 5.0. The rice alpha-amylase signal peptide was recognized and efficiently processed by yeast and the active, glycosylated enzyme was secreted into the culture media. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The Km and Vmax were found to be similar to those of alpha-amylases from other organisms. The high level of secretion observed in these studies may be due to the unique features of the rice signal peptide and/or to the glycosylation of the recombinant enzyme.
10791026	Identification and phylogenetic analysis of gypsy-type retrotransposons in the plant kingdom.	1999	Genes Genet Syst	PCR was performed with degenerate primers which hybridized to the homologous sequences in the reverse transcriptase (rt) genes of gypsy-type retrotransposons from rice (RIRE3, RIRE8 and RIRE2), using total DNA samples from various plants (monocots, dicots, pine, ginkgo, horsetail, liverwort and algae) as templates. Cloning and sequencing showed that the amplified fragments had various degrees of homology to the rt sequences of rice retrotransposons. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these retrotransposon homologues and some additional gypsy-type retrotransposons previously identified from plants could be classified into two families, A and B. In each family, the retrotransposons were further classifiable into several subfamilies. Interestingly, retrotransposons from a single or related plant species were clustered in each subfamily. This indicates that sequence divergence during vertical transmission has been a major influence on the evolution of gypsy-type retrotransposons in plants. The retrotransposons isolated from one plant species could often be classified into the two families. This indicates that the gypsy-type retrotransposons of a family evolved independently within a species without affecting the evolution of retrotransposons of the other family. Retrotransposons in each subfamily are characterized by the lengths of LTR, by the nucleotide sequences in the terminal regions of LTRs, and by the PBS (primer binding site) sequence complementary to the 3' sequence of a particular tRNA species.
9928939	Identification and characterization of novel retrotransposons of the gypsy type in rice.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	We found that two DNA fragments, which were obtained from Oryza sativa L cv. IR36 by PCR using degenerate primers designed for amplification of a rice gene, showed homology with the rt gene encoding reverse transcriptase of the Drosophila retrotransposon gypsy. We named the element from which they originated RIRE3 (for rice retrotransposon No. 3) and analyzed it further by isolating various clones containing segments of RIRE3. Nucleotide sequencing of the clones revealed that RIRE3 has LTRs (2316 bp) and that the internal sequence (5775 bp) includes a large ORF with gag and pol regions; the pol region includes the rt gene as well as the int gene encoding integrase in this order, as in gypsy. Interestingly, the region upstream of gag in RIRE3 contained another open reading frame, here called orf0, which does not exist in gypsy or in other retrotransposons related to it. In the course of characterizing RIRE3, we obtained a further clone, which showed less homology with the pol region of RIRE3. This clone was found to be derived from another gypsy-type retrotransposon (named RIRE8) containing the LTR sequence and orf0 both of which were only weakly homologous to that in RIRE3. Further characterization of RIRE8 revealed that there were actually two subtypes of RIRE8 (named RIRE8A and RIRE8B), which show little homology to each other in the orf0 region. Although the LTRs of RIRE3 and RIRE8 elements show very weak homology with each other, there exists a conserved sequence at their termini. We therefore carried out PCR using primers which hybridize to the rt gene of RIRE3, and total genomic DNA from various monocot and dicot plants as templates, and found that a family of RIRE3 elements was present in all plants tested.
11405631	A new gypsy-type retrotransposon, RIRE7: preferential insertion into the tandem repeat sequence TrsD in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions of rice chromosomes.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	A portion of an insertion sequence present in a member of the RIRE3 family of retrotransposons in Oryza sativa L. cv. IR36 was found to have an LTR sequence followed by a PBS sequence complementary to the 3'-end region of tRNAMet, indicative of another rice retrotransposon (named RIRE7). Cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments that made up all parts of the RIRE7 sequence showed that RIRE7 is a gypsy-type retrotransposon with partial homology in the pol region to the rice gypsy-type retrotransposons RIRE2 and RIRE3 identified in rice previously. Interestingly, various portions of the RIRE7 sequence were homologous to several DNA segments present in the centromere regions of cereal chromosomes. Further cloning and nucleotide sequencing of fragments flanking RIRE7 copies showed that RIRE7 was inserted into a site within a tandem repeat sequence that has a unit length of 155 bp. The tandem repeat sequence, named TrsD, was homologous to tandem repeat sequences RCS2 and CentC, previously identified in the centromeric regions of rice and maize chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the metaphase chromosomes of O. sativa cv. Nipponbare showed that both RIRE7 and TrsD sequences were present in the centromere regions of the chromosomes. The presence of RIRE7 and the TrsD sequences in the centromere regions of several chromosomes was confirmed by the identification of several YAC clones whose chromosomal locations are known. Further FISH analysis of rice pachytene chromosomes showed that the TrsD sequences were located in a pericentromeric heterochromatin region. These findings strongly suggest that RIRE7 and TrsD are components of the pericentromeric heterochromatin of rice chromosomes.
15215504	Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (OsTPC1) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytosolic free Ca2+ serves as an important second messenger participating in signal transduction of various environmental stresses. However, molecular bases for the plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and its regulation remain largely unknown. We here identified a gene (OsTPC1) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells. OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1. To elucidate its physiological roles, we generated transgenic rice plants and cultured cells overexpressing OsTPC1 mRNA. Furthermore, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertional knockout mutant of OsTPC1 was isolated. OsTPC1-overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the OsTPC1-knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that OsTPC1 has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane. OsTPC1-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots. Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants. These results suggest that OsTPC1 functions as a Ca2+ -permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development.
12782736	Low glutelin content1: a dominant mutation that suppresses the glutelin multigene family via RNA silencing in rice.	2003	Plant Cell	Low glutelin content1 (Lgc1) is a dominant mutation that reduces glutelin content in rice grains. Glutelin is a major seed storage protein encoded by a multigene family. RNA gel blot and reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR analyses revealed that Lgc1 acts at the mRNA level in a similarity-dependent manner. In Lgc1 homozygotes, there is a 3.5-kb deletion between two highly similar glutelin genes that forms a tail-to-tail inverted repeat, which might produce a double-stranded RNA molecule, a potent inducer of RNA silencing. The hypothesis that Lgc1 suppresses glutelin expression via RNA silencing is supported by transgenic analysis using this Lgc1 candidate region, by reporter gene analysis, and by the detection of small interfering RNAs. In this context, Lgc1 provides an interesting example of RNA silencing occurring among genes that exhibit various levels of similarity to an RNA-silencing-inducing gene. Possible mechanisms for gene silencing of the glutelin multigene family by Lgc1 are discussed.
15654622	Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	Members of the plant-specific gene family referred to as the NAC family (for NAM-ATAF-CUC-related) are involved in various functions including the regulation of plant development. However, no detailed molecular characterization of any member of the NAC family has yet been reported from monocots. Here, we report such a characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC-family gene identified using a cDNA cloned from microdissected phloem cells of rice. The predicted ONAC300 protein sequence falls into the NAM subgroup, which also contains the proteins CUC1 and CUC2 from Arabidopsis, CUP from snapdragon, CmNACP from pumpkin and NAM from petunia. High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves. The use of an ONAC300:: GUS reporter gene revealed that the ONAC300 promoter was expressed predominantly in developing vascular tissues of the leaves and roots. The construct was also expressed in anther filaments, rachis and carpel styles. RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles. The observed expression pattern of ONAC300 is quite different from those of the dicot NAC genes previously reported. Thus, ONAC300 is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice.
1531030	Nucleotide sequence of a rice rab16 homologue gene.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	
1363521	Molecular cloning and characterization of gravity specific cDNA in rice (Oryza sativa L.) suspension callus.	1992	Jpn J Genet	Rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare) suspension callus was exposed to gravity stress at 450,000 g for 2 hours, after which poly(A)+RNA was isolated and a cDNA library was constructed. Three different gravity specific cDNAs, namely, GSC 128, GSC 233 and GSC 381 of 0.67, 0.60 and 0.68 kilobase pairs and transcripts of 1.9, 1.6 and 2.0 kb, respectively, were isolated by differential screening and Northern hybridization. The maximum level of transcript was achieved after 4 hours of exposure to gravity at 450,000 g for GSC 128, 2 hours for GSC 233 and 8 hours for GSC 381 followed by a gradual decrease to undetectable levels with the extension of gravitation time. Callus (GSC 128), shoot and callus (GSC 381) and root and callus (GSC 233) specific expression of transcripts was identified. Although the protection of callus by treatment with ABA, kinetin and sucrose extended the period of expression of mRNA in suspension callus after gravity exposure, the expression of gravity-inducible mRNA was exclusively regulated by the degree of callus viability or survival after the stress. In addition, we demonstrated that the level of GSC 381 transcript was markedly increased by exposing the cell to periodical gravity stress, suggesting that this mRNA is expressed and translated into special proteins which are closely related to the survival of the cell against gravity stress. The sequence of GSC 233 and GSC 381, consisting of 417 and 531 base pairs of the longest open reading frames, encode polypeptides with calculated molecular weights of 15.29 and 19.47 kDa, respectively. A sequence homology search against a data bank revealed that GSC 233 and GSC 381 differed from other stress inducible genes in terms of the coding sequence and expression characteristics.
8278540	Light-regulated and cell-specific expression of tomato rbcS-gusA and rice rbcS-gusA fusion genes in transgenic rice.	1993	Plant Physiol	A previously isolated rice (Oryza sativa) rbcS gene was further characterized. This analysis revealed specific sequences in the 5' regulatory region of the rice rbcS gene that are conserved in rbcS genes of other monocotyledonous species. In transgenic rice plants, we examined the expression of the beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter gene directed by the 2.8-kb promoter region of the rice rbcS gene. To examine differences in the regulation of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous rbcS promoters, the activity of a tomato rbcS promoter was also investigated in transgenic rice plants. Our results indicated that both rice and tomato rbcS promoters confer mesophyll-specific expression of the gusA reporter gene in transgenic rice plants and that this expression is induced by light. However, the expression level of the rice rbcS-gusA gene was higher than that of the tomato rbcS-gusA gene, suggesting the presence of quantitative differences in the activity of these particular monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous rbcS promoters in transgenic rice. Histochemical analysis of rbcS-gusA gene expression showed that the observed light induction was only found in mesophyll cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the light regulation of rice rbcS-gusA gene expression was primarily at the level of mRNA accumulation. We show that the rice rbcS gene promoter should be useful for expression of agronomically important genes for genetic engineering of monocotyledonous species.
9482818	Down-regulation of RFL, the FLO/LFY homolog of rice, accompanied with panicle branch initiation.	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	FLORICAULA (FLO) of Antirrhinum and LEAFY (FLY) of Arabidopsis regulate the formation of floral meristems. To examine whether same mechanisms control floral development in distantly related species such as grasses, we isolated RFL, FLO-LFY homolog of rice, and examined its expression and function. Northern analysis showed that RFL is expressed predominantly in very young panicle but not in mature florets, mature leaves, or roots. In situ hybridization revealed that RFL RNA was expressed in epidermal cells in young leaves at vegetative growth stage. After the transition to reproductive stage, RFL RNA was detected in all layers of very young panicle including the apical meristem, but absent in the incipient primary branches. As development of branches proceeds, RFL RNA accumulation localized in the developing branches except for the apical meristems of the branches and secondary branch primordia. Expression pattern of RFL raised a possibility that, unlike FLO and LFY, RFL might be involved in panicle branching. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing RFL from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were produced to test whether 35S-RFL would cause similar phenotype as observed in 35S-LFY plants. In 35S-RFL plants, transformation of inflorescence meristem to floral meristem was rarely observed. Instead, development of cotyledons, rosette leaves, petals, and stamens was severely affected, demonstrating that RFL function is distinct from that of LFY. Our results suggest that mechanisms controlling floral development in rice might be diverged from that of Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum.
10945340	Spatially and temporally regulated expression of rice MADS box genes with similarity to Arabidopsis class A, B and C genes.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	The floral morphology of grass species is distinct from that of typical dicot plants. In order to achieve a better understanding of the molecular basis for this diversion, we isolated RAP1A, RAP1B and RAG, putative rice orthologs for the Arabidopsis class A gene APETALA1 (AP1) and class C gene AGAMOUS (AG). The expression patterns of RAP1A, RAG and OsMADS2, a rice ortholog of the class B gene, were analyzed by in situ hybridization. RAP1A mRNA was expressed in the apical region of the floral meristem at an early stage of spikelet development, and then its expression was localized in developing lemma, palea and lodicules. The OsMADS2 transcript was first observed in the region where stamen primordia are formed. Soon after, OsMADS2 mRNA appeared in the lodicule primordia as well as the stamen primordia, and this RNA accumulation pattern persisted until late stages of floral development. The expression of RAG was observed in stamens and pistils of wild-type young spikelets. These RNA accumulation patterns are mostly similar to those of Arabidopsis class A, B, C genes, supporting the notion that the ABC model may be extended to rice.
10394942	Characterization and heterologous expression of laccase cDNAs from xylem tissues of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Four closely related cDNA clones encoding laccase isoenzymes from xylem tissues of yellow-poplar (Ltlacc2.1-4) were identified and sequenced. The inferred yellow-poplar laccase gene products were highly related to one another (79-91% at the amino acid level) and showed significant similarity to other blue copper oxidases, especially with respect to the copper-binding domains. The encoded proteins had N-terminal signal sequences and 17-19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The mature proteins were predicted to have molecular masses of ca. 61 kDa (unglycosylated) and high isoelectric points (pI 9.3-9.5). The canonical copper ligands were conserved, with the exception of a Leu residue associated with the axial position of the Type-1 cupric ion. The residue at this position has been proposed to influence the redox potential of Type-1 cupric ions. Northern blot analysis revealed that the yellow-poplar laccase genes are differentially expressed in xylem tissues. The genes were verified as encoding active laccases by heterologous expression in tobacco cells and demonstration of laccase activity in extracts from transformed tobacco cell lines.
9119407	SMT3A, a human homologue of the S. cerevisiae SMT3 gene, maps to chromosome 21qter and defines a novel gene family.	1997	Genomics	cDNA selection was used to isolate coding sequences from cosmids mapping to the gene-rich telomeric region of human chromosome 21q. A novel cDNA, termed SMT3A, was isolated and mapped between the loci PFKL and D21S171, about 2.2 Mb proximal to the telomere. The predicted protein of 103 amino acids appears to be a homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SMT3 protein, whose gene was previously isolated as a suppressor of mutations in the MIF2 gene. The yeast MIF2 gene encodes an essential centromeric protein and shows homology to mammalian CENP-C, an integral component of active kinetochores. SMT3A was found to be highly homologous to two other recently isolated human genes, suggesting the presence of a new gene family. Homologous sequences were also found in protozoa, metazoa, and plants. Moreover, all predicted proteins show significant homology to ubiquitin. The proposed role of yeast SMT3 as centromeric protein and the strong evolutionary conservation of the SMT3A gene suggest an involvement of the encoded protein in the function and/or structure of the eukaryotic kinetochore.
10480395	Transcript accumulation and utilization of alternate and non-consensus splice sites in rice granule-bound starch synthase are temperature-sensitive and controlled by a single-nucleotide polymorphism.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), a product of the waxy gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.), is necessary for the synthesis of amylose in the endosperm. In an extended pedigree of 89 rice cultivars, we have previously shown that all cultivars with more than 18% amylose had the sequence AGGTATA at the leader intron 5' splice site, while all cultivars with a lower proportion of amylose had the sequence AGTTATA. This single-nucleotide polymorphism reduces the efficiency of GBSS pre-mRNA processing. It also results in alternate splicing at multiple sites, some of which have non-consensus sequences. Here we demonstrate that this same G-to-T polymorphism is also associated with differential sensitivity to temperature during the period of grain development. Cultivars with the sequence AGTTATA have a substantial increase in accumulation of mature GBSS transcripts at 18 degrees C compared to 25 or 32 degrees C. The selection of leader intron 5' splice sites is also affected by temperature in these cultivars. A 5' splice site -93 upstream from that used in high-amylose varieties predominates at 18 degrees C. At higher temperatures there is increased utilization of a 5' splice site at -I and a non-consensus site at +1. Potential implications of differential 5' splice site selection and associated differences in 3' splice site selection on transcript stability and translational efficiency are discussed.
2541432	Molecular cloning of plant transcripts encoding protein kinase homologs.	1989	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Oligonucleotides, corresponding to conserved regions of animal protein-serine/threonine kinases, were used to isolate cDNAs encoding plant homologs in the dicot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and the monocot rice (Oryzae sativa L.). The C-terminal regions of the deduced polypeptides encoded by the bean (PVPK-1) and rice (G11A) cDNAs, prepared from mRNAs of suspension cultures and leaves, respectively, contain features characteristic of the catalytic domains of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine kinases, indicating that these cDNAs encode plant protein kinases. The putative catalytic domains are most closely related to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and the protein kinase C family, suggesting the plant homologs may likewise transduce extracellular signals. However, outside these domains, PVPK-1 and G11A exhibit no homology either to each other or to regulatory domains of other protein kinases, indicating the plant homologs are modulated by other signals. PVPK-1 corresponds to a 2.4-kb transcript in suspension cultured bean cells. Southern blots of genomic DNA indicate that PVPK-1 and G11A correspond to single copy genes that form part of a family of related plant sequences.
10717479	Expression of the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein by oxidative stress in rice.	2000	Gene	A rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nakdong) cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein (smHSP) was isolated. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA and the result of screening of a cDNA library indicated that the Oshsp26 gene is encoded by a single gene in the rice genome. The Oshsp26 gene was expressed following heat stress: the transcript level was highest when rice leaves were treated at high temperatures for 2h at 42 degrees C, and the transcripts became detectable after 20min and reached a maximum level after 2h. It was also found that the Oshsp26 gene was expressed following oxidative stress even in the absence of heat stress. Treatment of rice plants with methyl viologen (MV) in the light and treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), either in the light or in the dark, both caused a significant accumulation of the transcripts and the protein. Since MV treatment in the light leads to the generation of H(2)O(2) inside the chloroplast, it is likely that H(2)O(2) by itself acts to induce the expression of the Oshsp26 gene. These results suggest that the chloroplast smHSP plays an important role in protecting the chloroplast against damage caused by oxidative stress as well as by heat stress.
9375784	Structure and expression of two cDNAs encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1997	Biochim Biophys Acta	Two cDNAs encoding rice (Oryza sativa L.) S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS) have been cloned, sequenced and identified. The deduced protein sequences share a high homology (90-94%) with those of other plant SAMS and are 60-62% identical to yeast, rat and human SAMS. The rice SAMS genes are differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner and by a salt stress, while they are coordinately expressed during growth of the rice cell culture.
10597036	Cloning and characterization of the chloroplast elongation factor EF-Tu cDNA of Oryza sativa L.	1999	Mol Cells	From the rice leaf cDNA library, we have cloned a cDNA encoding rice chloroplast translational elongation factor EF-Tu (tufA). The rice tufA cDNA clone contains 1678 nucleotides and codes for a 467 amino acid protein including a putative chloroplast transit peptide of 59 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular mass of the mature protein is approximately 45 kDa. This cDNA clone contains the 61 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the 213 nucleotides of 3' UTR. Amino acid sequence identity of the rice tufA with the mature chloroplast EF-Tu proteins of tobacco, pea, arabidopsis, and soybean ranges from 83% to 86%. The deduced polypeptide of the rice tufA cDNA contains GTP binding domains in its N-terminal region and chloroplast EF-Tu signature regions in the C-terminal region. The rice tufA appears to exist as a single copy gene, although its homologues of maize and oat exist as multiple copy genes. The rice tufA gene is located in chromosome 1 and is more highly expressed in the leaf than in root tissue.
16240176	Conservation and divergence of FCA function between Arabidopsis and rice.	2005	Plant Mol Biol	Although several genes have been identified in rice which are functionally equivalent to the flowering time genes in Arabidopsis, primarily genes involved in the photoperiod pathway, little data is available regarding the genes that function in the autonomous pathway in rice. In order to acquire further insight into the control of heading dates in rice, we isolated and conducted an expression analysis on OsFCA, which exhibited 38% sequence homology with Arabidopsis FCA. The N-terminal region of the OsFCA protein appears to be unusually rich in glycine-residues, unlike the N-terminal region found in FCA. However, the genetic structure of OsFCA is, in general, similar to that of FCA. RT-PCR and in silico analyses also showed that alternative splicing and polyadenylation at intron3 were conserved in the genetic expression of OsFCA. We were able to detect alpha, beta, and gamma transcripts, but not the delta transcript, of the OsFCA gene. The beta and gamma transcripts of the OsFCA gene were detected via Northern analysis in the leaves, roots, and flowers of the plant. Flowers in younger stages exhibited higher transcript levels. These data suggest that intron3 may constitute a primary control point in the OsFCA pre-mRNA processing of rice. The overexpression of OsFCA cDNA, driven by the 35S promoter, was shown to partially rescue the late flowering phenotype of the fca mutant, suggesting that the functions of the OsFCA and the FCA are partially overlapped, despite the lack of an apparent FLC homologue in the rice genome. The constitutive expression of OsFCA resulted in no downregulation of FLC, but did result in the weak upregulation of SOC1 in the transgenic Arabidopsis. OsFCA overexpression did not result in a reduction of the gamma transcript levels of FCA in the transgenic Arabidopsis either, thereby suggesting that OsFCA had no effects on the autoregulation of Arabidopsis FCA. All of these results imply conservation and divergence in the functions of FCA between rice and Arabidopsis.

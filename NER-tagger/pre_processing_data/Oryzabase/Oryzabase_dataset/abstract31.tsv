23267004	Microarray-assisted fine-mapping of quantitative trait loci for cold tolerance in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	Many important agronomic traits, including cold stress resistance, are complex and controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Isolation of these QTLs will greatly benefit the agricultural industry but it is a challenging task. This study explored an integrated strategy by combining microarray with QTL-mapping in order to identify cold-tolerant QTLs from a cold-tolerant variety IL112 at early-seedling stage. All the early seedlings of IL112 survived normally for 9 d at 4-5°C, while Guichao2 (GC2), an indica cultivar, died after 4 d under the same conditions. Using the F2:3 population derived from the progeny of GC2 and IL112, we identified seven QTLs for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we performed Affymetrix rice whole-genome array hybridization and obtained the expression profiles of IL112 and GC2 under both low-temperature and normal conditions. Four genes were selected as cold QTL-related candidates, based on microarray data mining and QTL-mapping. One candidate gene, LOC_Os07g22494, was shown to be highly associated with cold tolerance in a number of rice varieties and in the F2:3 population, and its overexpression transgenic rice plants displayed strong tolerance to low temperature at early-seedling stage. The results indicated that overexpression of this gene (LOC_Os07g22494) could increase cold tolerance in rice seedlings. Therefore, this study provides a promising strategy for identifying candidate genes in defined QTL regions.
23385446	Heterologous expression and metal-binding characterization of a type 1 metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) from rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Protein J	Metallothioneins (MTs) are ubiquitous, low molecular mass and cysteine-rich proteins that play important roles in maintaining intracellular metal homeostasis, eliminating metal toxification and protecting the cells against oxidative damages. MTs are able to bind metal ions through the thiol groups of their cysteine residues. Plants have several MT isoforms which are classified into four types based on the arrangement of cysteine residues. In the present study, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene encoding type 1 MT isoform, OsMTI-1b, was inserted in vector pET41a and overexpressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The recombinant protein GST-OsMTI-1b was purified using affinity chromatography and its ability to bind with Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions was analyzed. The results demonstrated that this isoform has ability to bind Ni(2+), Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) ions in vitro, whereas it has no substantial ability to bind Cu(2+) ions. From competitive reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTNB, the affinity of metal ions for recombinant form of GST-OsMTI-1b was as follows: Ni(2+)/Cd(2+) > Zn(2+) > Cu(2+).
23390608	Genetic and physiological characterization of two clusters of quantitative trait Loci associated with seed dormancy and plant height in rice.	2013	G3 (Bethesda)	Seed dormancy and plant height have been well-studied in plant genetics, but their relatedness and shared regulatory mechanisms in natural variants remain unclear. The introgression of chromosomal segments from weedy into cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) prompted the detection of two clusters (qSD1-2/qPH1 and qSD7-2/qPH7) of quantitative trait loci both associated with seed dormancy and plant height. Together, these two clusters accounted for >96% of the variances for plant height and ~71% of the variances for germination rate in an isogenic background across two environments. On the initial introgression segments, qSD1-2/qPH1 was dissected genetically from OsVp1 for vivipary and qSD7-2/qPH7 separated from Sdr4 for seed dormancy. The narrowed qSD1-2/qPH1 region encompasses the semidwarf1 (sd1) locus for gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. The qSD1-2/qPH1 allele from the cultivar reduced germination and stem elongation and the mutant effects were recovered by exogenous GA, suggesting that sd1 is a candidate gene of the cluster. In contrast, the effect-reducing allele at qSD7-2/qPH7 was derived from the weedy line; this allele was GA-insensitive and blocked GA responses of qSD1-2/qPH1, including the transcription of a GA-inducible α-amylase gene in imbibed endosperm, suggesting that qSD7-2/qPH7 may work downstream from qSD1-2/qPH1 in GA signaling. Thus, this research established the seed dormancy-plant height association that is likely mediated by GA biosynthesis and signaling pathways in natural populations. The detected association contributed to weed mimicry for the plant stature in the agro-ecosystem dominated by semidwarf cultivars and revealed the potential benefit of semidwarf genes in resistance to preharvest sprouting.
23230849	OsLEC1/OsHAP3E participates in the determination of meristem identity in both vegetative and reproductive developments of rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	In the vegetative phase of plant development, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces leaf primordia in regular phyllotaxy, and transforms to the inflorescence meristem when the plant enters reproductive growth, which will undergo a series of identity differentiations and will finally form a complete and fertile panicle. Our previous studies indicated a tissue-specific expression pattern of the OsLEC1 (leafy cotyledon) gene, which is homologous to the Arabidopsis AtLEC1 gene and belongs to the CCAAT-binding protein HAP3 subfamily, during embryo development. Expression of additional OsLEC1 genomic sequences resulted in abnormalities in the development of leaves, panicles and spikelets. The spikelets in particular presented abnormities, including panicle and spikelet-like structures that occurred reiteratively inside prior spikelets, and the occasional spikelet structures that completely transformed into plantlets (a reproductive habit alteration from sexual to asexual called "pseudovivipary"). Analysis showed that OsLEC1 interacts with several SEPALLATA-like MADS transcription factors, suggesting that increased levels of the OsLEC1 protein might interfere with the normal interaction network of these MADS proteins and lead to defective spikelet development. The expression of OsMADS1 was dramatically reduced, and the DNA methylation level of cytosine in certain regions of the OsMADS1 promoter was increased under OsLEC1 overexpression. These results indicate that OsLEC1 affects the development of leaves, panicles and spikelets, and is a key regulator of meristem identity determination in both rice (Oryza sativa) vegetative and reproductive development.
23424248	A role for more axillary growth1 (MAX1) in evolutionary diversity in strigolactone signaling upstream of MAX2.	2013	Plant Physiol	Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones with diverse roles. They are secreted from roots as attractants for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and have a wide range of endogenous functions, such as regulation of root and shoot system architecture. To date, six genes associated with SL synthesis and signaling have been molecularly identified using the shoot-branching mutants more axillary growth (max) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and dwarf (d) of rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the MAX/D genes to clarify the relationships of each gene with its wider family and to allow the correlation of events in the evolution of the genes with the evolution of SL function. Our analysis suggests that the notion of a distinct SL pathway is inappropriate. Instead, there may be a diversity of SL-like compounds, the response to which requires a D14/D14-like protein. This ancestral system could have been refined toward distinct ligand-specific pathways channeled through MAX2, the most downstream known component of SL signaling. MAX2 is tightly conserved among land plants and is more diverged from its nearest sister clade than any other SL-related gene, suggesting a pivotal role in the evolution of SL signaling. By contrast, the evidence suggests much greater flexibility upstream of MAX2. The MAX1 gene is a particularly strong candidate for contributing to diversification of inputs upstream of MAX2. Our functional analysis of the MAX1 family demonstrates the early origin of its catalytic function and both redundancy and functional diversification associated with its duplication in angiosperm lineages.
23437825	ORFH79 impairs mitochondrial function via interaction with a subunit of electron transport chain complex III in Honglian cytoplasmic male sterile rice.	2013	New Phytol	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has attracted great interest because of its application in crop breeding. Despite increasing knowledge of CMS, not much is understood about its molecular mechanisms. Previously, orfH79 was cloned and identified as the CMS gene in Honglian rice, but how the ORFH79 protein causes pollen abortion is still unknown. Through bacterial two-hybrid library screening, P61, a subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex III, was selected as a candidate that interacts with ORFH79. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays verified their interaction inside mitochondria. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and western blotting showed ORF79 and P61 colocalized in mitochondrial ETC complex III of CMS lines. Compared with the maintainer line, Yuetai B (YB), a significant decrease of enzyme activity was detected in mitochondrial complex III of the CMS line, Yuetai A (YA), which resulted in decreased ATP concentrations and an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. We propose that the CMS protein, ORFH79, can bind to complex III and decrease its enzyme activity through interaction with P61. This defect results in energy production dysfunction and oxidative stress in mitochondria, which may work as retrograde signals that lead to abnormal pollen development.
23400830	Three genetic systems controlling growth, development and productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.): a reevaluation of the 'Green Revolution'.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	The Green Revolution (GR-I) included worldwide adoption of semi-dwarf rice cultivars (SRCs) with mutant alleles at GA20ox2 or SD1 encoding gibberellin 20-oxidase. Two series of experiments were conducted to characterize the pleiotropic effects of SD1 and its relationships with large numbers of QTLs affecting rice growth, development and productivity. The pleiotropic effects of SD1 in the IR64 genetic background for increased height, root length/mass and grain weight, and for reduced spikelet fertility and delayed heading were first demonstrated using large populations derived from near isogenic IR64 lines of SD1. In the second set of experiments, QTLs controlling nine growth and yield traits were characterized using a new molecular quantitative genetics model and the phenotypic data of the well-known IR64/Azucena DH population evaluated across 11 environments, which revealed three genetic systems: the SD1-mediated, SD1-repressed and SD1-independent pathways that control rice growth, development and productivity. The SD1-mediated system comprised 43 functional genetic units (FGUs) controlled by GA. The SD1-repressed system was the alternative one comprising 38 FGUs that were only expressed in the mutant sd1 backgrounds. The SD1-independent one comprised 64 FGUs that were independent of SD1. GR-I resulted from the overall differences between the former two systems in the three aspects: (1) trait/environment-specific contributions; (2) distribution of favorable alleles for increased productivity in the parents; and (3) different responses to (fertilizer) inputs. Our results suggest that at 71.4 % of the detected loci, a QTL resulted from the difference between a functional allele and a loss-of-function mutant, whereas at the remaining 28.6 % of loci, from two functional alleles with differentiated effects. Our results suggest two general strategies to achieve GR-II (1) by further exploiting the genetic potential of the SD1-repressed and SD1-independent pathways and (2) by restoring the SD1-mediated pathways, or 'back to the nature' to fully exploit the genetic diversity of those loci in the SD1-mediated pathways which are virtually inaccessible to most rice-breeding programs worldwide that are exclusively based on sd1.
23437005	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice.	2013	PLoS Genet	Land plants have evolved increasingly complex regulatory modes of their flowering time (or heading date in crops). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that flowers more rapidly in short-day but delays under long-day conditions. Previous studies have shown that the CO-FT module initially identified in long-day plants (Arabidopsis) is evolutionary conserved in short-day plants (Hd1-Hd3a in rice). However, in rice, there is a unique Ehd1-dependent flowering pathway that is Hd1-independent. Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4). ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd4 encodes a novel CCCH-type zinc finger protein, which is localized to the nucleus and is able to bind to nucleic acids in vitro and transactivate transcription in yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional regulator. Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day conditions. We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators. Strikingly, Ehd4 is highly conserved in the Oryza genus including wild and cultivated rice, but has no homologs in other species, suggesting that Ehd4 is originated along with the diversification of the Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution. We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice.
23434671	Proteome Analysis of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Mutants Reveals Differentially Induced Proteins during Brown Planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) Infestation.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Although rice resistance plays an important role in controlling the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, not all varieties have the same level of protection against BPH infestation. Understanding the molecular interactions in rice defense response is an important tool to help to reveal unexplained processes that underlie rice resistance to BPH. A proteomics approach was used to explore how wild type IR64 and near-isogenic rice mutants with gain and loss of resistance to BPH respond during infestation. A total of 65 proteins were found markedly altered in wild type IR64 during BPH infestation. Fifty-two proteins associated with 11 functional categories were identified using mass spectrometry. Protein abundance was less altered at 2 and 14 days after infestation (DAI) (T1, T2, respectively), whereas higher protein levels were observed at 28 DAI (T3). This trend diminished at 34 DAI (T4). Comparative analysis of IR64 with mutants showed 22 proteins that may be potentially associated with rice resistance to the brown planthopper (BPH). Ten proteins were altered in susceptible mutant (D1131) whereas abundance of 12 proteins including S-like RNase, Glyoxalase I, EFTu1 and Salt stress root protein "RS1" was differentially changed in resistant mutant (D518). S-like RNase was found in greater quantities in D518 after BPH infestation but remained unchanged in IR64 and decreased in D1131. Taken together, this study shows a noticeable level of protein abundance in the resistant mutant D518 compared to the susceptible mutant D1131 that may be involved in rendering enhanced level of resistance against BPH.
23456247	A DESD-box helicase functions in salinity stress tolerance by improving photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. PB1).	2013	Plant Mol Biol	The exact mechanism of helicase-mediated salinity tolerance is not yet understood. We have isolated a DESD-box containing cDNA from Pisum sativum (Pea) and named it as PDH45. It is a unique member of DEAD-box helicase family; containing DESD instead of DEAD/H. PDH45 overexpression driven by constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter in rice transgenic [Oryza sativa L. cv. Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1)] plants confers salinity tolerance by improving the photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery. The Na(+) ion concentration and oxidative stress parameters in leaves of the NaCl (0, 100 or 200 mM) treated PDH45 overexpressing T1 transgenic lines were lower as compared to wild type (WT) rice plants under similar conditions. The 200 mM NaCl significantly reduced the leaf area, plant dry mass, net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 (Ci), chlorophyll (Chl) content in WT plants as compared to the transgenics. The T1 transgenics exhibited higher glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA) contents under salinity stress. The activities of antioxidant enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly higher in transgenics; suggesting the existence of an efficient antioxidant defence system to cope with salinity induced-oxidative damage. Yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that the PDH45 protein interacts with Cu/Zn SOD, adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-kinase, cysteine proteinase and eIF(4G), thus confirming the involvement of ROS scavenging machinery in the transgenic plants to provide salt tolerance. Furthermore, the T2 transgenics were also able to grow, flower, and set viable seeds under continuous salinity stress of 200 mM NaCl. This study provides insights into the mechanism of PDH45 mediated salinity stress tolerance by controlling the generation of stress induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also by protecting the photosynthetic machinery through a strengthened antioxidant system.
23421602	Knockdown of GDCH gene reveals reactive oxygen species-induced leaf senescence in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is a multi-protein complex, comprising P-, H-, T- and L-protein subunits, which plays a major role in photorespiration in plants. While structural analysis has demonstrated that the H subunit of GDC (GDCH) plays a pivotal role in GDC, research on the role of GDCH in biological processes in plants is seldom reported. Here, the function of GDCH, stresses resulting from GDCH-knockdown and the interactions of these stresses with other cellular processes were studied in rice plants. Under high CO(2), the OsGDCH RNA interference (OsGDCH-RNAi) plants grew normally, but under ambient CO(2), severely suppressed OsGDCH-RNAi plants (SSPs) were non-viable, which displayed a photorespiration-deficient phenotype. Under ambient CO(2), chlorophyll loss, protein degradation, lipid peroxidation and photosynthesis decline occurred in SSPs. Electron microscopy studies showed that chloroplast breakdown and autophagy took place in these plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including O2(-) and H(2)O(2), accumulated and the antioxidant enzyme activities decreased in the leaves of SSPs under ambient CO(2). The expression of transcription factors and senescence-associated genes (SAGs), which was up-regulated in SSPs after transfer to ambient CO(2), was enhanced in wild-type plants treated with H(2)O(2). Evidences demonstrate ROS induce senescence in SSPs, and transcription factors OsWRKY72 may mediate the ROS-induced senescence.
23396040	Towards understanding of molecular interactions between rice and the brown planthopper.	2013	Mol Plant	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious pest of rice (Oryza sativa). Studies of rice-BPH interaction have contributed to development of new rice varieties, offering an effective means for long-lasting control of BPH. Here, we review the status of knowledge of the molecular basis of rice-BPH interaction, from the perspective of immunity. The BPH has complicated feeding behaviors on rice, which are mainly related to host resistance. Now, 24 resistance genes have been detected in rice, indicating gene-for-gene relationships with biotypes of the BPH. However, only one BPH resistance gene (Bph14) was identified and characterized using map-based cloning. Bph14 encodes an immune receptor of NB-LRR family, providing a means for studying the molecular mechanisms of rice resistance to BPH. Plant hormones (e.g. salicylic acid and jasmonate/ethylene), Ca(2+), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and OsRac1 play important roles in the immune response of rice to BPH. Signal transduction leads to modifying expression of defense-related genes and defense mechanisms against BPH, including sieve tube sealing, production of secondary metabolites, and induction of proteinase inhibitor. A model for the molecular interactions between rice and the BPH is proposed, although many details remain to be investigated that are valuable for molecular design of BPH-resistant rice varieties.
23206229	The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance.	2013	Plant J	Plant genomes encode a large number of proteins that potentially function as immune receptors in the defense against pathogen invasion. As a well-characterized receptor kinase consisting of 23 tandem leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain and a serine/threonine kinase, the rice (Oryza sativa) protein XA21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) races that cause bacterial blight disease. We report here that XA21 binding protein 25 (XB25) belongs to the plant-specific ankyrin-repeat (PANK) family. XB25 physically interacts, in vitro, with the transmembrane domain of XA21 through its N-terminal binding to transmembrane and positively charged domain (BTMP) repeats. In addition, XB25 associates with XA21 in planta. The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage. Moreover, the accumulation of XB25 is induced by Xoo infection. Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance.
22992000	Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (GA20ox) catalyses consecutive steps of oxidation in the late part of the GA biosynthetic pathway. A T-DNA insertion mutant (17S-14) in rice, with an elongated phenotype, was isolated. Analysis of the flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion site revealed that an incomplete T-DNA integration resulted in enhanced constitutively expression of downstream OsGA20ox3 in the mutant. The accumulation of bioactive GA(1) and GA(4) were increased in the mutant in comparison with the wild-type plant. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsGA20ox3 showed phenotypes similar to those of the 17S-14 mutant, and the RNA interference (RNAi) lines that had decreased OsGA20ox3 expression exhibited a semidwarf phenotype. Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene. The OsGA20ox3 RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae (causing rice blast) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (causing bacterial blight) and increased expression of defense-related genes. Conversely, OsGA20ox3-overexpressing plants were more susceptible to these pathogens comparing with the wild-type plants. The susceptibility of wild-type plants to X. oryzae pv. oryzae was increased by exogenous application of GA(3) and decreased by S-3307 treatment. Together, the results provide direct evidence for a critical role of OsGA20ox3 in regulating not only plant stature but also disease resistance in rice.
23327584	Comparative proteome analyses reveal that nitric oxide is an important signal molecule in the response of rice to aluminum toxicity.	2013	J Proteome Res	Acidic soils inhibit crop yield and reduce grain quality. One of the major contributing factors to acidic soil is the presence of soluble aluminum (Al(3+)) ions, but the mechanisms underlying plant responses to Al(3+) toxicity remain elusive. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important messenger and participates in various plant physiological responses. Here, we demonstrate that Al(3+) induced an increase of NO in rice seedlings; adding exogenous NO alleviated the Al(3+) toxicity related to rice growth and photosynthetic capacity, effects that could be reversed by suppressing NO metabolism. Comparative proteomic analyses successfully identified 92 proteins that showed differential expression after Al(3+) or NO treatment. In particular, some of the proteins are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) metabolism. Further analyses confirmed that NO treatment reduced Al(3+)-induced ROS and RNS toxicities by increasing the activities and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes, as well as S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). Suppressing GSNOR enzymatic activity aggravated Al(3+) damage to rice and increased the accumulation of RNS. NO treatment altered the expression of proteins associated with cell wall synthesis, cell division and cell structure, calcium signaling and defense responses. On the basis of these results, we propose that NO activates multiple pathways that enhance rice adaptation to Al(3+) toxicity. Such findings may be applicable to crop engineering to enhance yield and improve stress tolerance.
23456295	Rice small C2-domain proteins are phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinase.	2013	Mol Cells	We previously reported that OsERG1 and OsERG3 encode rice small C2-domain proteins with different biochemical properties in Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding assays. Os-ERG1 exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding, which was not observed with OsERG3. In the present study, we show that both OsERG1 and OsERG3 proteins exhibit oligomerization properties as determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal the phosphorylation of OsERG1 and OsERG3 by a rice calcium-dependent protein kinase, OsCDPK5. Our mutation analysis on putative serine phosphorylation sites shows that the first serine (Ser) at position 41 of OsERG1 may be an essential residue for phosphorylation by OsCDPK5. Mutation of Ser41 to alanine (OsERG1S41A) and aspartate (OsERG1S41D) abolishes the ability of OsERG1 to bind phospholipids regardless of the presence or absence of Ca(2+) ions. In addition, unlike the OsERG1 wild-type form, the mutant OsERG1 (S41A)::smGFP construct lost the ability to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to calcium ions or fungal elicitor. These results indicate that Ser41 may be essential for the function of OsERG1.
23395688	Nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions affect RNA editing of cox2, atp6 and atp9 in alloplasmic male-sterile rice (Oryza sativa L.) lines.	2013	Mitochondrion	RNA editing plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in flowering plants. In this study, we examined RNA editing of the mitochondrial genes cox2, atp6 and atp9 in five isonuclear alloplasmic male-sterile lines (IAMSLs) of rice to investigate whether different cytoplasmic types affect RNA editing. Although many editing sites were conserved among the three genes, we found that the editing efficiency of certain sites was significantly different between different IAMSLs or between IAMSLs and their corresponding cytoplasmic donor CMS lines. Furthermore, several editing sites were found to be either present or absent in certain IAMSLs and their corresponding CMS lines. These results indicate that nuclear loci, as well as unknown editing factors within the mitochondria of different cytoplasmic types, may be involved in RNA editing, and they suggest that RNA editing in plant mitochondria is affected by nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions.
23500712	Transcriptome analysis of phytohormone, transporters and signaling pathways in response to vanadium stress in rice roots.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Trace concentrations of vanadium (V) have several benefits for plant growth, but high concentrations are toxic. To help characterize the cellular mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of V in plants, we present the first large-scale analysis of rice root responding to V during the early stages (1 and 3 h) of toxicity. Exposure to V triggered changes in the transcript levels of several genes related to cellular metabolic process, response to stimulus and transporters. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulated levels of genes associated with signaling and biosynthesis of auxin, abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in V-treated rice roots. In addition, V upregulated the expression of ATP-dependent GSH-conjugated transport, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and markedly downregulated of the expression of divalent cation transporters, drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) and zinc-iron permease (ZIP). Among the V-specific responsive transcription factors and protein kinases, the most predominant families were NAC (NAM, ATAF, CUC) transcription factor, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase VII (RLCK-VII) and leucine-rich repeat kinase VIII (LRR-VIII). These microarray data provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism of the rice roots response to V toxicity.
23423653	Fine mapping of qSB-11(LE), the QTL that confers partial resistance to rice sheath blight.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Sheath blight (SB), caused by Rhizoctonia solani kühn, is one of the most serious global rice diseases. No major resistance genes to SB have been identified so far. All discovered loci are quantitative resistance to rice SB. The qSB-11(LE) resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) has been previously reported on chromosome 11 of Lemont (LE). In this study, we report the precise location of qSB-11 (LE) . We developed a near isogenic line, NIL-qSB11(TQ), by marker-assisted selection that contains susceptible allele(s) from Teqing (TQ) at the qSB-11 locus in the LE genetic background. NIL-qSB11(TQ) shows higher susceptibility to SB than LE in both field and greenhouse tests, suggesting that this region of LE contains a QTL contributing to SB resistance. In order to eliminate the genetic background effects and increase the accuracy of phenotypic evaluation, a total of 112 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with the substituted segment specific to the qSB-11 (LE) region were produced as the fine mapping population. The genetic backgrounds and morphological characteristics of these CSSLs are similar to those of the recurrent parent LE. The donor TQ chromosomal segments in these CSSL lines contiguously overlap to bridge the qSB-11 (LE) region. Through artificial inoculation, all CSSLs were evaluated for resistance to SB in the field in 2005. For the recombinant lines, their phenotypes were evaluated in the field for another 3 years and during the final year were also evaluated in a controlled greenhouse environment, showing a consistent phenotype in SB resistance across years and conditions. After comparing the genotypic profile of each CSSL with its phenotype, we are able to localize qSB-11 (LE) to the region defined by two cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence markers, Z22-27C and Z23-33C covering 78.871 kb, based on the rice reference genome. Eleven putative genes were annotated within this region and three of them were considered the most likely candidates. The results of this study will greatly facilitate the cloning of the genes responsible for qSB-11 (LE) and marker-assisted breeding to incorporate qSB-11 (LE) into other rice cultivars.
23382237	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) positively regulates the activity and function of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is a major parameter determining seed production. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) Gn1a/OsCKX2 (Grain number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain number improvement in rice breeding practice. However, the molecular mechanism of how the expression of OsCKX2 is regulated in planta remains elusive. Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem. DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs. We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number. Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production. Our study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity, DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain production in rice and other small grain cereals.
23435087	OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice.	2013	Nat Genet	Reduction in seed shattering was an important phenotypic change during cereal domestication. Here we show that a simple morphological change in rice panicle shape, controlled by the SPR3 locus, has a large impact on seed-shedding and pollinating behaviors. In the wild genetic background of rice, we found that plants with a cultivated-like type of closed panicle had significantly reduced seed shedding through seed retention. In addition, the long awns in closed panicles disturbed the free exposure of anthers and stigmas on the flowering spikelets, resulting in a significant reduction of the outcrossing rate. We localized the SPR3 locus to a 9.3-kb genomic region, and our complementation tests suggest that this region regulates the liguleless gene (OsLG1). Sequencing analysis identified reduced nucleotide diversity and a selective sweep at the SPR3 locus in cultivated rice. Our results suggest that a closed panicle was a selected trait during rice domestication.
23300256	OsMADS16 genetically interacts with OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 in specifying floral patterning in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	Rice (Oryza sativa) has unique floral patterns that contribute to grain yield. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the specification of floral organ identities in rice, particularly the interaction among floral homeotic genes, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the floral homeotic gene OsMADS16 (also called SUPERWOMAN1, SPW1, a B-class gene) acts together with the rice C-class genes OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 in specifying floral organ patterning. OsMADS16 and the two C-class genes have an overlapping expression pattern in the third whorl founder cells. Compared with the single mutants, both spw1-1 osmads3-4 and spw1-1 osmads58 double mutants exhibit additional whorls of glume-like organs within the flower, particularly an extra whorl of six glume-like structures formed at the position of the wild-type stamens. These ectopic glume-like structures were shown to have palea identity through cellular observation and in situ hybridization analysis using marker genes. Our results suggest that B- and C-class genes play a key role in suppressing indeterminate growth within the floral meristem, particularly whorl-3 primordia. We also hypothesize that, in contrast to previous assumptions, the specialized spikelet organ in rice, the palea, is the counterpart of the sepal in eudicots, and the lemma is homologous to the bract.
23280541	Quaternary structure effects on the hexacoordination equilibrium in rice hemoglobin rHb1: insights from molecular dynamics simulations.	2013	Proteins	Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs) form a widely distributed class of plant proteins, which function remains unknown. Despite the fact that class 1 plant nonsymbiotic hemoglobins are hexacoordinate (6c) heme proteins (hxHbs), their hexacoordination equilibrium constants are much lower than in hxHbs from animals or bacteria. In addition, they are characterized by having very high oxygen affinities and low oxygen dissociation rate constants. Rice hemoglobin 1 (rHb1) is a class 1 nonsymbiotic hemoglobin. It crystallizes as a fully associated homodimer with both subunits in 6c state, but showing slightly different conformations, thus leading to an asymmetric crystallographic homodimer. The residues that constitute the dimeric interface are conserved among all nsHbs, suggesting that the quaternary structure could be relevant to explain the chemical behavior and biological function of this family of proteins. In this work, we analyze the molecular basis that determine the hexacoordination equilibrium in rHb1. Our results indicate that dynamical features of the quaternary structure significantly affect the hexacoordination process. Specifically, we observe that the pentacoordinate state is stabilized in the dimer with respect to the isolated monomers. Moreover, the dimer behaves asymmetrically, in a negative cooperative scheme. The results presented in this work are fully consistent with our previous hypothesis about the key role played by the nature of the CD region in determining the coordination state of globins.
23448934	[Morphological characteristics and gene mapping of a novel bent pedicel branch (bpb1) mutant in rice].	2013	Yi Chuan	Rice pedicels are tightly associated with the yield of grain. In the present study, a novel and stable pedicel mutant bpb1 (bent pedicel branch 1) was obtained from the wild type "Zhenong 7" after 60Co γ-ray treatment. The mutant had the typical phenotype of bent pedicel branches with multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as longer pedicels, short panicles, and dwarfism. Detail examination using scanning electron microscopy revealed that the pedicel epidermal hairs and stomas in the mutant were smaller than those in the wild type. The epidermal and sclerenchymatous cells were arranged irregularly, and the cells in the bend region of pedicels became smaller and arranged closely. The transverse observation of the mutant pedicel branches showed that the small vascular bundles arranged differently from those of the wild type. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by a single recessive gene. Using the F2 mapping population from the bpb1 mutant crossed with the japonica rice variety "Zhenongda 104", the bpb1 gene was mapped in a 343 kb region between two SSR markers, RM21537 and RM21552, at the long arm of chromosome 7. Because no homologous gene was found in this region until now, bpb1 might be a novel gene related to the pedicel development and growth. This study could be beneficial to future cloning and functional analysis of the bpb1 gene.
23420309	EAR motif mutation of rice OsERF3 alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance.	2013	Planta	OsERF3 is a transcriptional repressor with an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif (F/LDLNxxP), which transcriptionally represses the ethylene emission and drought tolerance in rice. However, its molecular mechanism to explore repression function remains unknown. Here, we first revealed that the expression of OsERF3 was induced by drought, salt, ACC and ABA treatment. In addition, it showed a higher expression level in the root and sheath than that in the leaf. Then, we generated transgenic rice overexpressing full-length OsERF3 (OE) and its mutation of EAR motif with the A 680/C substitution (mEAR), respectively. The physiological analyses showed that mEAR lines showed better drought tolerance and more ethylene emission compared with those of OE lines and wild type plants. Consistent with our previous research, the expression of ethylene synthesis genes, including ACO2, ACS2, and ACS6 was down-regulated in OE lines. However, the repression of OsERF3 was eliminated in mEAR lines. Specifically, ACS2 was up-regulated in mEAR lines compared with that in OE lines and WT plants, suggesting that the Leu/Ala substitution within the EAR motif resulted in loss of repression of OsERF3. Thus, our data reveal that the EAR motif is required for OsERF3 to transcriptionally regulate the ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice, providing new insight to the roles of ethylene-response factor proteins in regulating ethylene biosynthesis and stress response.
23430256	Rice Os9BGlu31 is a transglucosidase with the capacity to equilibrate phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and phytohormone glycoconjugates.	2013	J Biol Chem	Glycosylation is an important mechanism of controlling the reactivities and bioactivities of plant secondary metabolites and phytohormones. Rice (Oryza sativa) Os9BGlu31 is a glycoside hydrolase family GH1 transglycosidase that acts to transfer glucose between phenolic acids, phytohormones, and flavonoids. The highest activity was observed with the donors feruloyl-glucose, 4-coumaroyl-glucose, and sinapoyl-glucose, which are known to serve as donors in acyl and glucosyl transfer reactions in the vacuole, where Os9BGlu31 is localized. The free acids of these compounds also served as the best acceptors, suggesting that Os9BGlu31 may equilibrate the levels of phenolic acids and carboxylated phytohormones and their glucoconjugates. The Os9BGlu31 gene is most highly expressed in senescing flag leaf and developing seed and is induced in rice seedlings in response to drought stress and treatment with phytohormones, including abscisic acid, ethephon, methyljasmonate, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and kinetin. Although site-directed mutagenesis of Os9BGlu31 indicated a function for the putative catalytic acid/base (Glu(169)), catalytic nucleophile residues (Glu(387)), and His(386), the wild type enzyme displays an unusual lack of inhibition by mechanism-based inhibitors of GH1 β-glucosidases that utilize a double displacement retaining mechanism.
23602097	Isolation and characterization of two novel root-specific promoters in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Plant Sci	Novel root-specific promoters are important for developing methods to drive root-specific gene expression for nutrient and water absorption. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis identified high expression levels of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 in root tissues across developmental stages in comparison with the constitutive genes OsAct1 (rice Actin1 gene), OsUbi1 (rice polyubiquitin rubi1 gene), and OsCc1 (rice cytochrome c gene). The copy numbers of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 transcripts were highly accumulated in the examined root tissues but were not detected in young embryos or leaves at the indicated days after germination or in the panicle, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of OsAct1, OsUbi1, and OsCc1. Additionally, the promoter regions of these two genes were linked to the GUSplus reporter gene and transformed into rice. GUS staining of the transgenic plants showed that the Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 promoters were active in primary and secondary roots throughout the developmental stages, except in root hairs. The GUSPlus transcript levels were also highly root-specific in the transgenic rice. Overall, the two promoters are highly active in the root tissues of rice and can be useful for the root-specific enhancement of target gene(s).
23470720	Regulatory role of indeterminate domain 10 (IDD10) in ammonium-dependent gene expression in rice roots.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	One of the strategies that plants utilize to adapt to fluctuating soil nutrient levels is rapid reprogramming of transcriptional regulation via cell signaling mechanisms. Higher plants exposed to ammonium undergo modulation of a broad spectrum of gene expression. However, regulation of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying ammonium-mediated gene expression is poorly understood. We identified a transcriptional regulator, indeterminate domain 10 (IDD10), whose mutants exhibited an ammonium-hypersensitive root growth defect. To elucidate the molecular relationship between IDD10 and ammonium-mediated gene expression, ammonium-responsive genes were examined in mutants and overexpressors of IDD10. Among the key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes, AMT1;2 (ammonium transporter 1;2) and GDH2 (glutamate dehydrogenase 2) significantly depend on IDD10 expression levels for ammonium-mediated induction. Extensive molecular analysis revealed that IDD10 directly binds to the promoter of AMT1;2 and the fifth intron of GDH2 genes via the core sequence TTTGTC(C)/(G). Transcriptome analysis with root tissues identified many ammonium-inducible genes whose expression was increased by IDD10. Half of them contained potential IDD10-binding motifs in their promoters. This study determined that IDD10 is a transcriptional activator involved in nitrogen regulatory circuits that control a broad spectrum of gene expression, which might influence root growth in rice.
23521226	Transcriptional suppression of tryptamine 5-hydroxylase, a terminal serotonin biosynthetic gene, induces melatonin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Pineal Res	Rice tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H) is the second enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis, catalyzing tryptamine into serotonin. Transgenic rice plants, in which the expression of endogenous T5H was either overexpressed or repressed, were examined for alteration in melatonin biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, the overexpression genotypes showed reduced levels of melatonin, while the repression genotypes had elevated levels with an average increase of fourfold. With regard to melatonin intermediates, tryptamine and serotonin levels decreased, but tryptophan and N-acetylserotonin were unaltered in the overexpression genotypes compared with the wild type. In contrast, the repression genotypes had sevenfold higher tryptamine levels than the wild type. In addition, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan were present at higher levels in the repression genotypes than in both the wild-type and the overexpression genotypes. The enhanced melatonin synthesis in the repression genotypes was closely associated with a transcriptional increase in TDC1. When these rice plants were challenged by oxidative stressors such as herbicides, much higher melatonin synthesis was also observed in the repression genotypes than in either the wild-type or overexpression genotypes. These results suggest that the tryptamine increase through the suppression of T5H plays an important signaling role in triggering melatonin biosynthesis in rice, although the exact role of tryptamine remains to be uncovered.
23518283	The International Oryza Map Alignment Project: development of a genus-wide comparative genomics platform to help solve the 9 billion-people question.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	The wild relatives of rice contain a virtually untapped reservoir of traits that can be used help drive the 21st century green revolution aimed at solving world food security issues by 2050. To better understand and exploit the 23 species of the Oryza genus the rice research community is developing foundational resources composed of: 1) reference genomes and transcriptomes for all 23 species; 2) advanced mapping populations for functional and breeding studies; and 3) in situ conservation sites for ecological, evolutionary and population genomics. To this end, 16 genome sequencing projects are currently underway, and all completed assemblies have been annotated; and several advanced mapping populations have been developed, and more will be generated, mapped, and phenotyped, to uncover useful alleles. As wild Oryza populations are threatened by human activity and climate change, we also discuss the urgent need for sustainable in situ conservation of the genus.
23641184	Multiple and independent origins of short seeded alleles of GS3 in rice.	2013	Breed Sci	GRAIN SIZE 3 (GS3) is a cloned gene that is related to seed length. Here we report the discovery of new deletion alleles at the GS3 locus, each of which confer short seed. We selected ten short seeded cultivars from a collection of 282 diverse cultivars. Sequence analysis across the GS3 gene in these ten cultivars identified three novel alleles and a known allele that contain several independent deletion(s) in the fifth exon of GS. These independent deletion variants each resulted in a frameshift mutation that caused a premature stop codon, and they were functionally similar to one another. Each coded for a truncated gene product that behaved as an incomplete dominant allele and conferred a short seeded phenotype. Haplotype analysis of these sequence variants indicated that two of the variants were of japonica origin, and two were from indica. Transformation experiments demonstrated that one of the deletion alleles of GS3 decrease the cell number in the upper epidermis of the glume, resulting in a significant reduction in seed length. The multiple and independent origins of these short seeded alleles indicate that farmers and early breeders imposed artificial selection favoring short seeds.
23523465	Silicon decreases chloride transport in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in saline conditions.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Silicon can alleviate salt damage to plants, although the mechanism(s) still remains to be elucidated. In this paper, we report the effect of silicon on chloride transport in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in saline conditions. In the absence of salinity, silicon enhanced the growth of shoots, but not roots in three cultivars (cv. GR4, IR36, and CSR10). Salinity reduced the growth of both shoots and roots in all three genotypes. In saline conditions, addition of silicon to the culture solution again improved the growth of shoots, but not of roots. Under these saline conditions, the concentrations of chloride in the shoot were markedly decreased by adding silicon and the ratio of K(+)/Cl(-) was significantly increased, while the concentration of chloride in the roots was unchanged. The decrease in chloride concentration in the shoot was correlated with the decrease in transpirational bypass flow in rice, as shown by the transport of the apoplastic tracer trisodium-8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS). Addition of silicon increased the net photosynthetic rate, stomata conductance, and transpiration of salt-stressed plants in cv. IR36, indicating that the reduction of chloride (and sodium) uptake by silicon was not through a reduction in transpiration rate. Silicon addition also increased the instantaneous water use efficiency of salt-stressed plants, while it did not change the relative growth rate of shoots. The results suggest that silicon addition decreased transpirational bypass flow in the roots, and therefore decreased the transport of chloride to the shoot.
23496930	Comparative analysis of protein-protein interactions in the defense response of rice and wheat.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of wheat as a major staple crop and the negative impact of diseases on its production worldwide, the genetic mechanisms and gene interactions involved in the resistance response in wheat are still poorly understood. The complete sequence of the rice genome has provided an extremely useful parallel road map for genetic and genomics studies in wheat. The recent construction of a defense response interactome in rice has the potential to further enhance the translation of advances in rice to wheat and other grasses. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of conservation in the protein-protein interactions in the rice and wheat defense response interactomes. As entry points we selected proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response: the RAR1/SGT1/HSP90 protein complex, NPR1, XA21, and XB12 (XA21 interacting protein 12).

RESULTS: Using available wheat sequence databases and phylogenetic analyses we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of these four rice proteins, including recently duplicated paralogs, and their known direct interactors and tested 86 binary protein interactions using yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. All interactions between wheat proteins were further tested using in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Eighty three percent of the known rice interactions were confirmed when wheat proteins were tested with rice interactors and 76% were confirmed using wheat protein pairs. All interactions in the RAR1/SGT1/ HSP90, NPR1 and XB12 nodes were confirmed for the identified orthologous wheat proteins, whereas only forty four percent of the interactions were confirmed in the interactome node centered on XA21. We hypothesize that this reduction may be associated with a different sub-functionalization history of the multiple duplications that occurred in this gene family after the divergence of the wheat and rice lineages.

CONCLUSIONS: The observed high conservation of interactions between proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response suggests that the existing rice interactome can be used to predict interactions in wheat. Such predictions are less reliable for nodes that have undergone a different history of duplications and sub-functionalization in the two lineages.
23496140	SUB1A-mediated submergence tolerance response in rice involves differential regulation of the brassinosteroid pathway.	2013	New Phytol	· Submergence 1A (SUB1A), is an ethylene response factor (ERF) that confers submergence tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) via limiting shoot elongation during the inundation period. SUB1A has been proposed to restrict shoot growth by modulating gibberellic acid (GA) signaling. · Our transcriptome analysis indicated that SUB1A differentially regulates genes associated with brassinosteroid (BR) synthesis during submergence. Consistent with the gene expression data, the SUB1A genotype had higher brassinosteroid levels after submergence compared to the intolerant genotype. Tolerance to submergence can be activated in the intolerant genotype by pretreatment with exogenous brassinolide, which results in restricted shoot elongation during submergence. · BR induced a GA catabolic gene, resulting in lower GA levels in SUB1A plants. BR treatment also induced the DELLA protein SLR1, a known repressor of GA responses such as shoot elongation. We propose that BR limits GA levels during submergence in the SUB1A rice through a GA catabolic enzyme as part of an early response and may repress GA responses by inducing SLR1 after several days of submergence. · Our results suggest that BR biosynthesis is regulated in a SUB1A-dependent manner during submergence and is involved in modulating the GA signaling and homeostasis.
23347338	Identification of rice Allene Oxide Cyclase mutants and the function of jasmonate for defence against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Plant J	Two photomorphogenic mutants of rice, coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, were found to be defective in the gene encoding allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) by map-based cloning and complementation assays. Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds. The level of jasmonate was extremely low in both mutants, in agreement with the fact that rice has only one gene encoding allene oxide cyclase. Several flower-related mutant phenotypes were observed, including morphological abnormalities of the flower and early flowering. We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Inoculation assays with fungal spores revealed that both mutants are more susceptible than wild-type to an incompatible strain of M. oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues. The level of jasmonate isoleucine, a bioactive form of jasmonate, increased in response to blast infection. Furthermore, blast-induced accumulation of phytoalexins, especially that of the flavonoid sakuranetin, was found to be severely impaired in cpm2 and hebiba. Together, the present study demonstrates that, in rice, jasmonate mediates the defence response against blast fungus.
23495675	Involvement of phytochrome A in suppression of photomorphogenesis in rice seedling grown in red light.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Plants have evolved a remarkable capacity to track and respond to fluctuations of light quality and intensity that influence photomorphogenesis facilitated through several photoreceptors, which include a small family of phytochromes. Rice seedlings grown on germination paper in red light for 48 h having their shoot bottom exposed had suppressed photomorphogenesis and were deficient in chlorophyll. Seedlings grown under identical light regime having their shoot bottom covered were green and accumulated chlorophyll. Further, etiolated seedlings with their shoot bottom exposed, when grown in 4 min red/far-red cycles for 48 h, accumulated chlorophyll demonstrating the reversal of suppression of photomorphogenesis by far-red light. It implicates the involvement of phytochrome. Immunoblot analysis showed the persistence of photolabile phytochrome A protein for 48 h in seedlings grown in red light with their shoot bottom exposed, suggesting its involvement in suppression of photomorphogenesis. This was further corroborated in phyA seedlings that turned green when grown in red light having their shoot bottom exposed. Calmodulin (CaM) antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalene sulphonamide or trifluoperazine substantially restored photomorphogenesis both in the wild type (WT) and phyA demonstrating the involvement of CaM-dependent kinases in the down-regulation of the greening process. Results demonstrate that red light-induced suppression of photomorphogenesis, perceived in the shoot bottom, is a red high irradiance response of PhyA.
23373859	Lowland rice: high-end submergence tolerance.	2013	New Phytol	
23477923	Structure and function of florigen and the receptor complex.	2013	Trends Plant Sci	In the 1930s, the flowering hormone, florigen, was proposed to be synthesized in leaves under inductive day length and transported to the shoot apex, where it induces flowering. More recently, generated genetic and biochemical data suggest that florigen is a protein encoded by the gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). A rice (Oryza sativa) FT homolog, Hd3a, interacts with the rice FD homolog, OsFD1, via a 14-3-3 protein. Formation of this tri-protein complex is essential for flowering promotion by Hd3a in rice. In addition, the multifunctionality of FT homologs, other than for flowering promotion, is an emerging concept. Here we review the structural and biochemical features of the florigen protein complex and discuss the molecular basis for the multifunctionality of FT proteins.
23508257	5' Regulatory region of ubiquitin 2 gene from Porteresia coarctata makes efficient promoters for transgene expression in monocots and dicots.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Porteresia ubiquitin 5' regulatory region drives transgene expression in monocots and dicots. Ubiquitin promoters are promising candidates for constitutive transgene expression in plants. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel 5' regulatory sequence of a ubiquitin gene from Porteresia coarctata, a stress-tolerant wild grass species. Through functional analysis in heterologous plant systems, we have demonstrated that full length (Port Ubi2.3) or truncated sequence (PD2) of the isolated regulatory fragment can drive constitutive expression of GUS in monocots and/or dicots. In silico analysis of Port Ubi2.3 has revealed the presence of a 640 bp core promoter region followed by two exons and two introns with numerous putative cis-acting sites scattered throughout the regulatory region. Transformation and expression studies of six different deletion constructs in rice, tobacco and sugarcane revealed that the proximal intron has an enhancing effect on the activity of the core promoter in both monocots and dicots, whereas, Port Ubi2.3 was able to render strong expression only in monocots. This regulatory sequence is quite distinct from the other reported ubiquitin promoters in structure and performs better in monocots compared to other commonly used promoters-maize Ubi1 and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S.
23498959	A receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase targeted by a plant pathogen effector is directly phosphorylated by the chitin receptor and mediates rice immunity.	2013	Cell Host Microbe	CERK1 is a lysine motif-containing plant pattern recognition receptor for chitin and peptidoglycan. Chitin recognition by OsCERK1 triggers rapid engagement of a rice MAP kinase cascade, which leads to defense response activation. How the MAP kinase cascades are engaged downstream of OsCERK1 remains obscure. Searching for host proteins that interact with Xoo1488, an effector of the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae, we identified the rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK185. Silencing OsRLCK185 suppressed peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immune responses, including MAP kinase activation and defense-gene expression. In response to chitin, OsRLCK185 associates with, and is directly phosphorylated by, OsCERK1 at the plasma membrane. Xoo1488 inhibits peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immunity and pathogen resistance. Additionally, OsCERK1-mediated phosphorylation of OsRLCK185 is suppressed by Xoo1488, resulting in the inhibition of chitin-induced MAP kinase activation. These data support a role for OsRLCK185 as an essential immediate downstream signaling partner of OsCERK1 in mediating chitin- and peptidoglycan-induced plant immunity.
23234404	Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Hormone crosstalk is pivotal in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report on the accumulation of cytokinins (CK) in rice seedlings after infection of blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its potential significance in rice-M. oryzae interaction. Blast infection to rice seedlings increased levels of N(6)-(Δ(2)-isopentenyl) adenine (iP), iP riboside (iPR), and iPR 5'-phosphates (iPRP) in leaf blades. Consistent with this, CK signaling was activated around the infection sites, as shown by histochemical staining for β-glucuronidase activity driven by a CK-responsive OsRR6 promoter. Diverse CK species were also detected in the hyphae (mycelium), conidia, and culture filtrates of blast fungus, indicating that M. oryzae is capable of production as well as hyphal secretion of CK. Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1). These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators. Taken together, our data imply a coevolutionary rice-M. oryzae interaction, wherein M. oryzae probably elevates rice CK levels for its own benefits such as nutrient translocation. Rice plants, on the other hand, sense it as an infection signal and activate defense reactions through the synergistic action with SA.
23499843	The N-terminal tetra-peptide (IPDE) short extension of the U-box motif in rice SPL11 E3 is essential for the interaction with E2 and ubiquitin-ligase activity.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Rice, a monocot model plant, contains at least 77 U-box E3 ubiquitin (Ub)-ligases and 48 E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes. Here, we investigated the minimal binding domain of rice SPL11 U-box E3 to its E2 partners. Serial deletions and site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicated that, in addition to an intact U-box motif, the N-terminal tetra-peptide (IPDE) short extension of the U-box was essential for the interaction of SPL11 with E2s and Ub-ligase activity. The Ile and Pro residues at the -4 and -3 positions of the U-box, respectively, were crucial for this interaction. These results suggest that the N-terminal tetra-peptide extension of the U-box participates in the specific interaction of SPL11 E3 with E2s in a sequence-specific manner in rice.
23643394	Inheritance studies of SSR and ISSR molecular markers and phylogenetic relationship of rice genotypes resistant to tungro virus.	2013	C R Biol	Multivariate analyses were performed using 13 morphological traits and 13 molecular markers (10 SSRs and three ISSRs) to assess the phylogenetic relationship among tungro resistant genotypes. For morphological traits, the genotypes were grouped into six clusters, according to D(2) statistic and Canonical vector analysis. Plant height, days to flowering, days to maturity, panicle length, number of spikelet per panicle, number of unfilled grain per panicle and yield were important contributors to genetic divergence in 14 rice genotypes. Based on Nei's genetic distance for molecular studies, seven clusters were formed among the tungro resistant and susceptible genotypes. Mantel's test revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.834*) between the morphological and molecular data. To develop high yielding tungro resistant varieties based on both morphological and molecular analyses, crosses could be made with susceptible (BR10 and BR11) genotypes with low yielding but highly resistant genotypes, Sonahidemota, Kumragoir, Nakuchimota, Khaiyamota, Khairymota and Kachamota. The chi-square analysis for seven alleles (RM11, RM17, RM20, RM23, RM80, RM108 and RM531) of SSR and five loci (RY1, MR1, MR2, MR4 and GF5) of three ISSR markers in F2 population of cross, BR11×Sonahidemota, showed a good fit to the expected segregation ratio (1:2:1) for a single gene model.
23466806	Analysis of the expression of the AGL17-like clade of MADS-box transcription factors in rice.	None	Gene Expr Patterns	In plants, MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of floral and fruit development, organ dehiscence and stress responses. Nevertheless, the functions of most of them are still unknown. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AGL17-like clade of MADS-box transcription factors comprises four members. AGL17 is involved in floral induction, whereas AGL44/ANR1 is involved in the adaptive development of roots in response to nitrate. AGL21 is primarily expressed in the roots and AGL16 in the leaves, suggesting that these transcription factors may be involved in the control of vegetative development. In Oryza sativa, the AGL17-like clade comprises five members, OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27, OsMADS57 and OsMADS61. In a first attempt to characterize their functions, we used promoter::Gus reporter gene fusions and RT-qPCR to study the expression patterns of these genes and their regulation by different external stimuli. The OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27 and OsMADS57 promoters were active in the root's central cylinder. In addition, the OsMADS57 promoter was active in leaves, whereas the OsMADS61 promoter was only active in the leaf tips and the stem base. OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 transcripts accumulated in response to osmotic stress, whereas the expression levels of OsMADS25, OsMADS27 and OsMADS57 were slightly induced by nitrate. Each of these five genes was responsive to various hormonal treatments. These distinct expression patterns indicate that these five genes have specific and non-redundant functions that likely differs from those of their A. thaliana homologs.
23279638	The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39 is translocated into rice cells independently of a fungal-derived machinery.	2013	Plant J	Effector proteins are key elements in plant-fungal interactions. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae secretes numerous effectors that are suspected to be translocated inside plant cells. However, their cellular targets and the mechanisms of translocation are still unknown. Here, we have identified the open reading frame (ORF3) corresponding to the M. oryzae avirulence gene AVR1-CO39 that interacts with the rice resistance gene Pi-CO39 and encodes a small secreted protein without homology to other proteins. We demonstrate that AVR1-CO39 is specifically expressed and secreted at the plant-fungal interface during the biotrophic phase of infection. Live-cell imaging with M. oryzae transformants expressing a translational fusion between AVR1-CO39 and the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) indicated that AVR1-CO39 is translocated into the cytoplasm of infected rice cells. Transient expression of an AVR1-CO39 isoform without a signal peptide in rice protoplasts triggers a Pi-CO39-specific hypersensitive response, suggesting that recognition of AVR1-CO39 by the Pi-CO39 gene product occurs in the cytoplasm of rice cells. The native AVR1-CO39 protein enters the secretory pathway of rice protoplasts as demonstrated by the ER localization of AVR1-CO39:mRFP:HDEL translational fusions, and is correctly processed as shown by Western blotting. However, this secreted AVR1-CO39 isoform triggers a Pi-CO39-specific hypersensitive response and accumulates inside rice protoplasts as shown by Western blotting and localization of AVR1-CO39:mRFP translational fusions. This indicates that AVR1-CO39 is secreted by rice protoplasts and re-enters into the cytoplasm by unknown mechanisms, suggesting that translocation of AVR1-CO39 into rice cells occurs independently of fungal factors.
23420902	Two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3, control leaf width in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Leaf shape is one of the key determinants of plant architecture. Leaf shape also affects the amount of sunlight captured and influences photosynthetic efficiency; thus, it is an important agronomic trait in crop plants. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing leaf shape is a central issue of plant developmental biology and agrobiotechnology. Here, we characterized the narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90, a linkage tester line of rice (Oryza sativa). Light and scanning electron microscopic analyses of FL90 leaves revealed defects in the development of marginal regions and a reduction in the number of longitudinal veins. The narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90 shows a two-factor recessive inheritance and is caused by the loss of function of two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, NAL2 and NAL3 (NAL2/3), which are duplicate genes orthologous to maize NS1 and NS2 and to Arabidopsis PRS. The overexpression of NAL2/3 in transgenic rice plants results in wider leaves containing increased numbers of veins, suggesting that NAL2/3 expression regulates leaf width. Thus, NAL2/3 can be used to modulate leaf shape and improve agronomic yield in crop plants.
23521023	Genetic variation, heritability, divergence and biomass accumulation of rice genotypes resistant to bacterial blight revealed by quantitative traits and ISSR markers.	2013	Physiol Plant	A field experiment was carried out in order to evaluate genetic diversity of 41 rice genotypes using physiological traits and molecular markers. All the genotypes unveiled variations for crop growth rate (CGR), relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), yield per hill (Yhill(-1)), total dry matter (TDM), harvest index (HI), photosynthetic rate (PR), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b at maximum tillering stage. The CGR values varied from 0.23 to 0.76 gm cm(-2) day(-1). The Yhill(-1) ranged from 15.91 to 92.26 g, while TDM value was in the range of 7.49 to 20.45 g hill(-1). PR was found to vary from 9.40 to 22.34 µmol m(-2) s(-1). PR expressed positive relation with Yhill(-1). Significant positive relation was found between CGR and TDM (r = 0.61**), NAR and CGR (r = 0.62**) and between TDM and NAR (r = 0.31**). High heritability was found in RGR and Yhill(-1). Cluster analysis based on the traits grouped 41 rice genotypes into seven clusters. A total of 310 polymorphic loci were detected across the 20 inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. The UPGMA dendrogram grouped 41 rice genotypes into 11 clusters including several sub-clusters. The Mantel test revealed positive correlation between quantitative traits and molecular markers (r = 0.41). On the basis of quantitative traits and molecular marker analyses parental genotypes, IRBB54 with MR84, IRBB60 with MR84, Purbachi with MR263, IRBB65 with BR29, IRBB65 with Pulut Siding and MRQ74 with Purbachi could be hybridized for future breeding program.
23519729	Rice slender leaf 1 gene encodes cellulose synthase-like D4 and is specifically expressed in M-phase cells to regulate cell proliferation.	2013	J Exp Bot	Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes are predicted to catalyse the biosynthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides such as the β-D-glycan backbone of hemicelluloses and are classified into nine subfamilies (CSLA-CSLH and CSLJ). The CSLD subfamily is conserved in all land plants, and among the nine CSL subfamilies, it shows the highest sequence similarity to the cellulose synthase genes, suggesting that it plays fundamental roles in plant development. This study presents a detailed analysis of slender leaf 1 (sle1) mutants of rice that showed rolled and narrow leaf blades and a reduction in plant height. The narrow leaf blade of sle1 was caused by reduced cell proliferation beginning at the P3 primordial stage. In addition to the size reduction of organs, sle1 mutants exhibited serious developmental defects in pollen formation, anther dehiscence, stomata formation, and cell arrangement in various tissues. Map-based cloning revealed that SLE1 encodes the OsCSLD4 protein, which was identified previously from a narrow leaf and dwarf 1 mutant. In situ hybridization experiments showed that OsCSLD4 was expressed in a patchy pattern in developing organs. Double-target in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that SLE1 was expressed specifically during the M-phase of the cell cycle, and suggested that the cell-cycle regulation was altered in sle1 mutants. These results suggest that the OsCSLD4 protein plays a pivotal role in the M phase to regulate cell proliferation. Further study of OsCSLD4 is expected to yield new insight into the role of hemicelluloses in plant development.
23463776	Empty pericarp5 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein that is required for mitochondrial RNA editing and seed development in maize.	2013	Plant Cell	In flowering plants, RNA editing is a posttranscriptional mechanism that converts specific cytidines to uridines in both mitochondrial and plastidial transcripts, altering the information encoded by these genes. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the empty pericarp5 (emp5) mutants in maize (Zea mays). Null mutation of Emp5 results in abortion of embryo and endosperm development at early stages. Emp5 encodes a mitochondrion-targeted DYW subgroup pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. Analysis of the mitochondrial transcripts revealed that loss of the EMP5 function abolishes the C-to-U editing of ribosomal protein L16 at the rpl16-458 site (100% edited in the wild type), decreases the editing at nine sites in NADH dehydrogenase9 (nad9), cytochrome c oxidase3 (cox3), and ribosomal protein S12 (rps12), and surprisingly increases the editing at five sites of ATP synthase F0 subunit a (atp6), apocytochrome b (cob), nad1, and rpl16. Mutant EMP5-4 lacking the E+ and DYW domains still retains the substrate specificity and editing function, only at reduced efficiency. This suggests that the E+ and DYW domains of EMP5 are not essential to the EMP5 editing function but are necessary for efficiency. Analysis of the ortholog in rice (Oryza sativa) indicates that rice EMP5 has a conserved function in C-to-U editing of the rice mitochondrial rpl16-458 site. EMP5 knockdown expression in transgenics resulted in slow growth and defective seeds. These results demonstrate that Emp5 encodes a PPR-DYW protein that is required for the editing of multiple transcripts in mitochondria, and the editing events, particularly the C-to-U editing at the rpl16-458 site, are critical to the mitochondrial functions and, hence, to seed development in maize.
23462973	OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	WRKY transcription factors form a large family of plant-specific transcription factors and participate in plant defense responses either as positive or negative regulators. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, OsWRKY28, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137. The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76. The GFP-OsWRKY28 fusion protein localized mainly in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and the maltose-binding protein-fused OsWRKY28 recombinant protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient reporter gene assay clearly showed that OsWRKY28 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of OsWRKY28 in rice plants resulted in enhanced susceptibility to Ina86-137. Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in OsWRKY28-overexpressing rice plants. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY28 is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels.
23456248	OsSNDP1, a Sec14-nodulin domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in root hair elongation in rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Rice is cultivated in water-logged paddy lands. Thus, rice root hairs on the epidermal layers are exposed to a different redox status of nitrogen species, organic acids, and metal ions than root hairs growing in drained soil. To identify genes that play an important role in root hair growth, a forward genetics approach was used to screen for short-root-hair mutants. A short-root-hair mutant was identified and isolated by using map-based cloning and sequencing. The mutation arose from a single amino acid substitution of OsSNDP1 (Oryza sativa Sec14-nodulin domain protein), which shows high sequence homology with Arabidopsis COW1/AtSFH1 and encodes a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP). By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was utilized to further characterize the effect of the Ossndp1 mutation on root hair morphology. Aberrant morphogenesis was detected in root hair elongation and maturation zones. Many root hairs were branched and showed irregular shapes due to bulged nodes. Many epidermal cells also produced dome-shaped root hairs, which indicated that root hair elongation ceased at an early stage. These studies showed that PITP-mediated phospholipid signaling and metabolism is critical for root hair elongation in rice.
23529204	Enhanced resistance to stripe rust disease in transgenic wheat expressing the rice chitinase gene RC24.	2013	Transgenic Res	Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease of wheat worldwide which is primarily caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici. Transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) expressing rice class chitinase gene RC24 were developed by particle bombardment of immature embryos and tested for resistance to Puccinia striiformis f.sp tritici. under greenhouse and field conditions. Putative transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing media. Polymease chain reaction indicated that RC24 was transferred into 17 transformants obtained from bombardment of 1,684 immature embryos. Integration of RC24 was confirmed by Southern blot with a RC24-labeled probe and expression of RC24 was verified by RT-PCR. Nine transgenic T1 lines exhibited enhanced resistance to stripe rust infection with lines XN8 and BF4 showing the highest level of resistance. Southern blot hybridization confirmed the stable inheritance of RC24 in transgenic T1 plants. Resistance to stripe rust in transgenic T2 and T3 XN8 and BF4 plants was confirmed over two consecutive years in the field. Increased yield (27-36 %) was recorded for transgenic T2 and T3 XN8 and BF4 plants compared to controls. These results suggest that rice class I chitinase RC24 can be used to engineer stripe rust resistance in wheat.
23526892	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G α subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice.	2013	PLoS Genet	Heterotrimeric G proteins are an important group of signaling molecules found in eukaryotes. They function with G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) to transduce various signals such as steroid hormones in animals. Nevertheless, their functions in plants are not well-defined. Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice is involved in a phytohormone gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway. Evidence also implicates D1 in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway. However, it is unclear how D1 functions in this pathway, because so far no partner has been identified to act with D1. In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment. Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs. Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BR-signaling pathway. This supports the idea that a D1-mediated BR signaling pathway occurs in rice to affect plant growth and development.
23505380	Polycomb group gene OsFIE2 regulates rice (Oryza sativa) seed development and grain filling via a mechanism distinct from Arabidopsis.	2013	PLoS Genet	Cereal endosperm represents 60% of the calories consumed by human beings worldwide. In addition, cereals also serve as the primary feedstock for livestock. However, the regulatory mechanism of cereal endosperm and seed development is largely unknown. Polycomb complex has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of endosperm development in Arabidopsis, but its role in cereal endosperm development remains obscure. Additionally, the enzyme activities of the polycomb complexes have not been demonstrated in plants. Here we purified the rice OsFIE2-polycomb complex using tandem affinity purification and demonstrated its specific H3 methyltransferase activity. We found that the OsFIE2 gene product was responsible for H3K27me3 production specifically in vivo. Genetic studies showed that a reduction of OsFIE2 expression led to smaller seeds, partially filled seeds, and partial loss of seed dormancy. Gene expression and proteomics analyses found that the starch synthesis rate limiting step enzyme and multiple storage proteins are down-regulated in OsFIE2 reduction lines. Genome wide ChIP-Seq data analysis shows that H3K27me3 is associated with many genes in the young seeds. The H3K27me3 modification and gene expression in a key helix-loop-helix transcription factor is shown to be regulated by OsFIE2. Our results suggest that OsFIE2-polycomb complex positively regulates rice endosperm development and grain filling via a mechanism highly different from that in Arabidopsis.
23480486	Characterization and mapping of a salt-sensitive mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	A salt-sensitive mutant designated rice salt sensitive 2 (rss2) was isolated from the M2 generation of the rice cultivar Nipponbare mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). This mutant exhibited a greater decrease in salt tolerance with a significant increase in Na(+) content in its shoots. Genetic analysis indicated that the increase in Na(+) in rss2 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Further genome-wide analysis of the linkage map constructed from the F2 population of rss2/Zhaiyeqing 8 (ZYQ8) showed that two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1 and 6 were responsible for the Na(+) concentration in shoots, which explained 14.5% and 53.3%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance. The locus on chromosome 1, but not that on chromosome 6, was also detected in the F2 population of Nipponbare/ZYQ8, suggesting that the QTL on chromosome 6 was responsible for the salt sensitivity in rss2. By analyzing the recombination events in 220 mutant individuals of an enlarged mapping population of rss2/ZYQ8, the rss2 locus was precisely mapped to an interval of 605.3 kb between insertion/deletion (InDel) markers IM21962 and IM22567. This finding will facilitate the cloning of the rss2 locus and provide insight into the physiological mechanisms of salt sensitivity in rice.
23331932	Identification of a cis-element that mediates multiple pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice.	2013	Plant J	The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen leads to ER stress. Intracellular signalling pathways are activated to alleviate the stress. The ER stress sensor IRE1 induces the active form of key transcription factors, such as XBP1 in mammals and bZIP50 in Oryza sativa (rice), by mediating the unconventional splicing of their mRNAs. Although the characterization of cis-elements that are recognized by these transcription factors is essential for understanding ER stress responses, such cis-elements remain unidentified in plants. Here, a cis-element named pUPRE-II was identified from promoters of bZIP50-dependent genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The sequence of pUPRE-II (e.g., 5'-GATGACGCGTAC-3' in the OsSAR1 promoter) was found to be flexible and not identical with that of mUPRE, a cis-element that preferentially interacts with mammalian XBP1. Unexpectedly, the transcription factor bZIP60, another ER stress sensor in rice, and a counterpart of mammalian ATF6, also showed strong binding affinity for pUPRE-II without assistance from co-factors. Reporter assays indicated that pUPRE-II significantly contributes to gene expression mediated by bZIP50 or bZIP60 in rice. Although both bZIP50 and bZIP60 bound to pUPRE-II, these transcription factors showed distinct requirements for transcriptional activation. This study provides a missing link between ER stress sensors and stress-responsive genes in rice. Furthermore, the characteristics of pUPRE-II highlight the uniqueness of ER stress-responsive transcription in plants.
23519921	Homologous expression of cytosolic dehydroascorbate reductase increases grain yield and biomass under paddy field conditions in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica).	2013	Planta	Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) maintains redox pools of ascorbate (AsA) by recycling oxidized AsA to reduced AsA. To investigate whether DHAR affects rice yield under normal environmental conditions, cDNA-encoding DHAR (OsDHAR1) was isolated from rice and used to develop OsDHAR1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants, under the regulation of a maize ubiquitin promoter. Incorporation and expression of the transgene in transgenic rice plants was confirmed by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR), semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), western blot, and enzyme activity. The expression levels were at least twofold higher in transgenic (TG) rice plants than in control wild-type (WT) rice plants. In addition, OsDHAR1-overexpression in seven-independent homologous transgenic plants, as compared to WT plants, increased photosynthetic capacity and antioxidant enzyme activities under paddy field conditions, which led to an improved AsA pool and redox homeostasis. Furthermore, OsDHAR1 overexpression significantly improved grain yield and biomass due to the increase of culm and root weights and to enhance panicle and spikelet numbers in the same seven independent TG rice plants during the farming season (2010 and 2011) in South Korea. The OsDHAR protein contained the redox-active site (Cys20), as well as the conserved GSH-binding region, GSH-binding motif, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) N-terminal domain, C-terminal domain interface, and GST C-terminal domain. Therefore, our results indicate that OsDHAR1 overexpression, capable of functioning in AsA recycling, and protein folding increases environmental adaptation to paddy field conditions by the improving AsA pool and redox homeostasis, which enhances rice grain yield and biomass.
23289852	The rice faded green leaf locus encodes protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B and is essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions.	2013	Plant J	NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes photoreduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide in chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis, and is required for prolamellar body (PLB) formation in etioplasts. Rice faded green leaf (fgl) mutants develop yellow/white leaf variegation and necrotic lesions during leaf elongation in field-grown plants. Map-based cloning revealed that FGL encodes OsPORB, one of two rice POR isoforms. In fgl, etiolated seedlings contained smaller PLBs in etioplasts, and lower levels of total and photoactive Pchlide. Under constant or high light (HL) conditions, newly emerging green leaves rapidly turned yellow and formed lesions. Increased levels of non-photoactive Pchlide, which acts as a photosensitizer, may cause reactive oxygen accumulation and lesion formation. OsPORA expression is repressed by light and OsPORB expression is regulated in a circadian rhythm in short-day conditions. OsPORA was expressed at high levels in developing leaves and decreased dramatically in fully mature leaves, whereas OsPORB expression was relatively constant throughout leaf development, similar to expression patterns of AtPORA and AtPORB in Arabidopsis. However, OsPORB expression is rapidly upregulated by HL treatment, similar to the fluence rate-dependent regulation of AtPORC. This suggests that OsPORB function is equivalent to both AtPORB and AtPORC functions. Our results demonstrate that OsPORB is essential for maintaining light-dependent Chl synthesis throughout leaf development, especially under HL conditions, whereas OsPORA mainly functions in the early stages of leaf development. Developmentally and physiologically distinct roles of monocot OsPORs are discussed by comparing with those of dicot AtPORs.
23512849	Secretome analysis of the rice bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae (Xoo) using in vitro and in planta systems.	2013	Proteomics	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight disease in rice, and that severely affects yield loss (upto 50%) of total rice production. Here, we report a proteomics investigation of Xoo (compatible race K3)-secreted proteins, isolated from its in vitro culture and in planta infected rice leaves. 2DE coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS and/or nLC-ESI-MS/MS approaches identified 139 protein spots (out of 153 differential spots), encoding 109 unique proteins. Identified proteins belonged to multiple biological and molecular functions. Metabolic and nutrient uptake proteins were common up to both in vitro and in planta secretomes. However, pathogenicity, protease/peptidase, and host defense-related proteins were highly or specifically expressed during in planta infection. A good correlation was observed between protein and transcript abundances for nine proteins secreted in planta as per semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. Transgenic rice leaf sheath (carrying PBZ1 promoter::GFP cell death reporter), when used to express a few of the identified secretory proteins, showed a direct activation of cell death signaling, suggesting their involvement in pathogenicity related with secretion effectors. This work furthers our understanding of rice bacterial blight disease, and serves as a resource for possible translation in generating disease resistant rice plants for improved seed yield.
23289750	OsCYP2, a chaperone involved in degradation of auxin-responsive proteins, plays crucial roles in rice lateral root initiation.	2013	Plant J	Auxin plays a pivotal role in many facets of plant development. It acts by inducing the interaction between auxin-responsive [auxin (AUX)/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] proteins and the ubiquitin protein ligase SCF(TIR) to promote the degradation of the AUX/IAA proteins. Other cofactors and chaperones that participate in auxin signaling remain to be identified. Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) plants with mutations in a cyclophilin gene (OsCYP2). cyp2 mutants showed defects in auxin responses and exhibited a variety of auxin-related growth defects in the root. In cyp2 mutants, lateral root initiation was blocked after nuclear migration but before the first anticlinal division of the pericycle cell. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down results revealed an association between OsCYP2 and the co-chaperone Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 (OsSGT1). Luciferase complementation imaging assays further supported this interaction. Similar to previous findings in an Arabidopsis thaliana SGT1 mutant (atsgt1b), degradation of AUX/IAA proteins was retarded in cyp2 mutants treated with exogenous 1-naphthylacetic acid. Our results suggest that OsCYP2 participates in auxin signal transduction by interacting with OsSGT1.

23526395	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice.	2013	Sci China Life Sci	Grain shape and size both determine grain weight and therefore crop yield. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling grain shape and size are still largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly. Starch granules were also irregularly packaged in the bsg1 grains. Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size. Map-based cloning revealed that BSG1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein, TRIANGULAR HULL 1, of unknown function. Quantitative PCR and GUS fusion reporter assays showed that BSG1 was expressed mainly in the young panicle and elongating stem. The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice. Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull.
23602104	Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice.	2013	Plant Sci	Bacterial blight is one of the most destructive rice diseases, which caused by Xoo, and results in yield losses, endangering worldwide food security. Diterpenoid phytoalexins, a type of antimicrobials produced in rice, are critical for resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. This article reports the characterization of the cytochrome P450 gene Oscyp71Z2, which belongs to the CYP71Z subfamily. Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage. The accumulation of phytoalexins was rapidly and strongly induced in Oscyp71Z2-overexpressing plants, and the transcript levels of genes related to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway were elevated. The H₂O₂ concentration in Oscyp71Z2-overexpressing plants was reduced in accordance with the increase in ROS-scavenging ability due to the induction of SOD as well as POD and CAT activation. We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice. These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H₂O₂ generation.
23346890	OsORC3 is required for lateral root development in rice.	2013	Plant J	The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a pivotal element in DNA replication, heterochromatin assembly, checkpoint regulation and chromosome assembly. Although the functions of the ORC have been determined in yeast and model animals, they remain largely unknown in the plant kingdom. In this study, Oryza sativa Origin Recognition Complex subunit 3 (OsORC3) was cloned using map-based cloning procedures, and functionally characterized using a rice (Oryza sativa) orc3 mutant. The mutant showed a temperature-dependent defect in lateral root (LR) development. Map-based cloning showed that a G→A mutation in the 9th exon of OsORC3 was responsible for the mutant phenotype. OsORC3 was strongly expressed in regions of active cell proliferation, including the primary root tip, stem base, lateral root primordium, emerged lateral root primordium, lateral root tip, young shoot, anther and ovary. OsORC3 knockdown plants lacked lateral roots and had a dwarf phenotype. The root meristematic zone of ORC3 knockdown plants exhibited increased cell death and reduced vital activity compared to the wild-type. CYCB1;1::GUS activity and methylene blue staining showed that lateral root primordia initiated normally in the orc3 mutant, but stopped growing before formation of the stele and ground tissue. Our results indicate that OsORC3 plays a crucial role in the emergence of lateral root primordia.
23485991	A Rice Immunophilin Gene, OsFKBP16-3, Confers Tolerance to Environmental Stress in Arabidopsis and Rice.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	The putative thylakoid lumen immunophilin, FKBP16-3, has not yet been characterized, although this protein is known to be regulated by thioredoxin and possesses a well-conserved CxxxC motif in photosynthetic organisms. Here, we characterized rice OsFKBP16-3 and examined the role of this gene in the regulation of abiotic stress in plants. FKBP16-3s are well conserved in eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms, including the presence of a unique disulfide-forming CxxxC motif in their N-terminal regions. OsFKBP16-3 was mainly expressed in rice leaf tissues and was upregulated by various abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, high light, hydrogen peroxide, heat and methyl viologen. The chloroplast localization of OsFKBP16-3-GFP was confirmed through the transient expression of OsFKBP16-3 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Transgenic Arabidopsis and transgenic rice plants that constitutively expressed OsFKBP16-3 exhibited increased tolerance to salinity, drought and oxidative stresses, but showed no change in growth or phenotype, compared with vector control plants, when grown under non-stressed conditions. This is the first report to demonstrate the potential role of FKBP16-3 in the environmental stress response, which may be regulated by a redox relay process in the thylakoid lumen, suggesting that artificial regulation of FKBP16-3 expression is a candidate for stress-tolerant crop breeding.
23602899	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Rab proteins play an essential role in regulating vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells. Previously, we characterized OsRab11, which in concert with OsGAP1 and OsGDI3 regulates vesicular trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane or vacuole. To further elucidate the physiological function of OsRab11 in plants, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using OsRab11 as bait. OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11. A co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed this interaction. The green fluorescent protein-OsOPR8 fusion product was targeted to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes of protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana. OsOPR8 exhibited NADPH-dependent reduction activity when 2-cyclohexen-1-one (CyHE) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) were supplied as possible substrates. Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included. OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments. Overexpressed OsRab11 transgenic plants showed resistance to pathogens through induced expression of JA-responsive genes. In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8.
23629674	Characterization of Rice NADPH oxidase genes and their expression under various environmental conditions.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (Noxs) are key producers of reactive oxygen species under both normal and stress conditions in plants. We demonstrate that at least eleven genes in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were predicted to encode Nox proteins, including nine genes (OsNox1-9) that encode typical Noxs and two that encode ancient Nox forms (ferric reduction oxidase 1 and 7, OsFRO1 and OsFRO7). Phylogenetic analysis divided the Noxs from nine plant species into six subfamilies, with rice Nox genes distributed among subfamilies I to V. Gene expression analysis using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR indicated that the expression of rice Nox genes depends on organs and environmental conditions. Exogenous calcium strongly stimulated the expression of OsNox3, OsNox5, OsNox7, and OsNox8, but depressed the expression of OsFRO1. Drought stress substantially upregulated the expression of OsNox1-3, OsNox5, OsNox9, and OsFRO1, but downregulated OsNox6. High temperature upregulated OsNox5-9, but significantly downregulated OsNox1-3 and OsFRO1. NaCl treatment increased the expression of OsNox2, OsNox8, OsFRO1, and OsFRO7, but decreased that of OsNox1, OsNox3, OsNox5, and OsNox6. These results suggest that the expression profiles of rice Nox genes have unique stress-response characteristics, reflecting their related but distinct functions in response to different environmental stresses.
23576519	The use of RelocaTE and unassembled short reads to produce high-resolution snapshots of transposable element generated diversity in rice.	2013	G3 (Bethesda)	Transposable elements (TEs) are dynamic components of genomes that often vary in copy number among members of the same species. With the advent of next-generation sequencing TE insertion-site polymorphism can be examined at an unprecedented level of detail when combined with easy-to-use bioinformatics software. Here we report a new tool, RelocaTE, that rapidly identifies specific TE insertions that are either polymorphic or shared between a reference and unassembled next-generation sequencing reads. Furthermore, a novel companion tool, CharacTErizer, exploits the depth of coverage to classify genotypes of nonreference insertions as homozygous, heterozygous or, when analyzing an active TE family, as rare somatic insertion or excision events. It does this by comparing the numbers of RelocaTE aligned reads to reads that map to the same genomic position without the TE. Although RelocaTE and CharacTErizer can be used for any TE, they were developed to analyze the very active mPing element which is undergoing massive amplification in specific strains of Oryza sativa (rice). Three individuals of one of these strains, A123, were resequenced and analyzed for mPing insertion site polymorphisms. The majority of mPing insertions found (~97%) are not present in the reference, and two siblings from a self-crossed of this strain were found to share only ~90% of their insertions. Private insertions are primarily heterozygous but include both homozygous and predicted somatic insertions. The reliability of the predicted genotypes was validated by polymerase chain reaction.
23376772	Disruption of secondary wall cellulose biosynthesis alters cadmium translocation and tolerance in rice plants.	2013	Mol Plant	Tricheary elements (TEs), wrapped by secondary cell wall, play essential roles in water, mineral, and nutrient transduction. Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that is absorbed by roots and transported to shoot, leaves, and grains through vascular systems in plants. As rice is a major source of Cd intake, many efforts have been made to establish 'low-Cd rice'. However, no links have been found between cellulose biosynthesis and cadmium accumulation. We report here a rice brittle culm13 mutant, resulting from a novel missense mutation (E101K) [corrected] in the N-terminus of cellulose synthase subunit 9 (CESA9). Except for the abnormal mechanical strength, the mutant plants are morphologically indistinguishable from the wild-type plants. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and chemical analyses showed a slight reduction in secondary wall thickness and 22% decrease in cellulose content in bc13 plants. Moreover, this mutation unexpectedly confers the mutant plants Cd tolerance due to less Cd accumulation in leaves. Expression analysis of the genes required for Cd uptake and transport revealed complicated alterations after applying Cd to wild-type and bc13. The mutants were further found to have altered vascular structure. More importantly, Cd concentration in the xylem saps from the bc13 plants was significantly lower than that from the wild-type. Combining the analyses of CESA9 gene expression and Cd content retention in the cell-wall residues, we conclude that CESA9(E101K) [corrected] mutation alters cell-wall properties in the conducting tissues, which consequently affects Cd translocation efficiency that largely contributes to the low Cd accumulation in the mutant plants.
23601492	Induction of toxin-specific neutralizing immunity by molecularly uniform rice-based oral cholera toxin B subunit vaccine without plant-associated sugar modification.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Plants have been used as expression systems for a number of vaccines. However, the expression of vaccines in plants sometimes results in unexpected modification of the vaccines by N-terminal blocking and sugar-chain attachment. Although MucoRice-CTB was thought to be the first cold-chain-free and unpurified oral vaccine, the molecular heterogeneity of MucoRice-CTB, together with plant-based sugar modifications of the CTB protein, has made it difficult to assess immunological activity of vaccine and yield from rice seed. Using a T-DNA vector driven by a prolamin promoter and a signal peptide added to an overexpression vaccine cassette, we established MucoRice-CTB/Q as a new generation oral cholera vaccine for humans use. We confirmed that MucoRice-CTB/Q produces a single CTB monomer with an Asn to Gln substitution at the 4th glycosylation position. The complete amino acid sequence of MucoRice-CTB/Q was determined by MS/MS analysis and the exact amount of expressed CTB was determined by SDS-PAGE densitometric analysis to be an average of 2.35 mg of CTB/g of seed. To compare the immunogenicity of MucoRice-CTB/Q, which has no plant-based glycosylation modifications, with that of the original MucoRice-CTB/N, which is modified with a plant N-glycan, we orally immunized mice and macaques with the two preparations. Similar levels of CTB-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies with toxin-neutralizing activity were induced in mice and macaques orally immunized with MucoRice-CTB/Q or MucoRice-CTB/N. These results show that the molecular uniformed MucoRice-CTB/Q vaccine without plant N-glycan has potential as a safe and efficacious oral vaccine candidate for human use.
23355544	Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications: H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac in Oryza sativa L. Japonica.	2013	Mol Plant	While previous studies have shown that histone modifications could influence plant growth and development by regulating gene transcription, knowledge about the relationships between these modifications and gene expression is still limited. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), to investigate the genome-wide distribution of four histone modifications: di and trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acylation of H3K9 and H3K27 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac) in Oryza sativa L. japonica. By analyzing published DNase-Seq data, this study explored DNase-Hypersensitive (DH) sites along the rice genome. The histone marks appeared mainly in generic regions and were enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. This analysis demonstrated that the four histone modifications and the DH sites were all associated with active transcription. Furthermore, the four histone modifications were highly concurrent with transcript regions-a promising feature that was used to predict missing genes in the rice gene annotation. The predictions were further validated by experimentally confirming the transcription of two predicted missing genes. Moreover, a sequence motif analysis was constructed in order to identify the DH sites and many putative transcription factor binding sites.
23603961	MAP kinases phosphorylate rice WRKY45.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	WRKY45 transcription factor is a central regulator of disease resistance mediated by the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway in rice. SA-activated WRKY45 protein induces the accumulation of its own mRNA. However, the mechanism underlying this regulation is still unknown. Here, we report three lines of evidence showing that a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is involved in this regulation. An inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) suppressed the increase in WRKY45 transcript level in response to SA. Two MAPKs, OsMPK4 and OsMPK6, phosphorylated WRKY45 protein in vitro. The activity of OsMPK6 was rapidly upregulated by SA treatment in rice cells. These results suggest that WRKY45 is regulated by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation in the SA pathway.
23570336	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	Plant male reproductive development is a complex biological process, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) male sterile mutant. Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility. Therefore, we named this mutant osabcg15. Expression analysis showed that OsABCG15 is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage). Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules. Consistently, histological analysis showed that osabcg15 mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores. The results suggest that OsABCG15 plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development, similar to the homologous gene of AtABCG26 in Arabidopsis. This work is helpful to understand the regulatory network in rice anther development.
23563093	An integrative bioinformatics framework for genome-scale multiple level network reconstruction of rice.	2013	J Integr Bioinform	Understanding how metabolic reactions translate the genome of an organism into its phenotype is a grand challenge in biology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistically connect genotypes to phenotypes, without any recourse to known molecular interactions, whereas a molecular mechanistic description ties gene function to phenotype through gene regulatory networks (GRNs), protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and molecular pathways. Integration of different regulatory information levels of an organism is expected to provide a good way for mapping genotypes to phenotypes. However, the lack of curated metabolic model of rice is blocking the exploration of genome-scale multi-level network reconstruction. Here, we have merged GRNs, PPIs and genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) approaches into a single framework for rice via omics&rsquo; regulatory information reconstruction and integration. Firstly, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model, containing 4,462 function genes, 2,986 metabolites involved in 3,316 reactions, and compartmentalized into ten subcellular locations. Furthermore, 90,358 pairs of protein-protein interactions, 662,936 pairs of gene regulations and 1,763 microRNA-target interactions were integrated into the metabolic model. Eventually, a database was developped for systematically storing and retrieving the genome-scale multi-level network of rice. This provides a reference for understanding genotype-phenotype relationship of rice, and for analysis of its molecular regulatory network.
23539245	Transgenic rice seeds accumulating recombinant hypoallergenic birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 generate giant protein bodies.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	A versatile hypoallergenic allergen derivative against multiple allergens is an ideal tolerogen for allergen-specific immunotherapy. Such a tolerogen should exhibit high efficacy, without side effects, when administered at high doses and should be applicable to several allergens. Tree pollen chimera 7 (TPC7), a hypoallergenic Bet v 1 tolerogen against birch pollen allergy, was previously selected by DNA shuffling of 14 types of Fagales tree pollen allergens. In this study, transgenic rice seed accumulating TPC7 was generated as an oral vaccine against birch pollen allergy by expressing this protein as a secretory protein using the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal KDEL tag under the control of an endosperm-specific glutelin promoter. The highest level of TPC7 accumulation was approximately 207 µg grain(-1). Recombinant TPC7 is a glycoprotein with high mannose-type N-glycan, but without β1,2-xylose or α1,3-fucose, suggesting that TPC7 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TPC7 is deposited as a novel, giant spherical ER-derived protein body, >20 µm in diameter, which is referred to as the TPC7 body. Removal of the KDEL retention signal or mutation of a cysteine residue resulted in an alteration of TPC7 body morphology, and deletion of the signal peptide prevented the accumulation of TPC7 in rice seeds. Therefore, the novel TPC7 bodies may have formed aggregates within the ER lumen, primarily due to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the protein.
23628812	Global value of GM rice: a review of expected agronomic and consumer benefits.	2013	N Biotechnol	Unlike the other major crops, no genetically modified (GM) varieties of rice have been commercialized at a large scale. Within the next 2-3 years new transgenic rice varieties could be ready for regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization, though. Given the importance of rice as staple crop for many of the world's poorest people, this will have implications for the alleviation of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, policy-makers need to be aware of the potential benefits of GM rice. We provide an overview of the literature and discuss the evidence on expected agronomic and consumer benefits of genetically engineered rice. We find that while GM rice with improved agronomic traits could deliver benefits similar to already commercialized biotechnology crops, expected benefits of consumer traits could be higher by an order of magnitude. By aggregating the expected annual benefits, we estimate the global value of GM rice to be US$64 billion per year. This is only an indicative value, as more GM varieties will become available in future. Nevertheless, such a figure can help guide policy-makers when deciding on the approval or funding of biotechnology crops and it may also raise awareness among consumers about what is at stake for their societies.
23551229	The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (OsWOX3A) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development.	2013	New Phytol	· In order to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice (Oryza sativa) organ development, we studied the narrow leaf2 narrow leaf3 (nal2 nal3; hereafter nal2/3) double mutant, which produces narrow-curly leaves, more tillers, fewer lateral roots, opened spikelets and narrow-thin grains. · We found that narrow-curly leaves resulted mainly from reduced lateral-axis outgrowth with fewer longitudinal veins and more, larger bulliform cells. Opened spikelets, possibly caused by marginal deformity in the lemma, gave rise to narrow-thin grains. · Map-based cloning revealed that NAL2 and NAL3 are paralogs that encode an identical OsWOX3A (OsNS) transcriptional activator, homologous to NARROW SHEATH1 (NS1) and NS2 in maize and PRESSED FLOWER in Arabidopsis. · OsWOX3A is expressed in the vascular tissues of various organs, where nal2/3 mutant phenotypes were displayed. Expression levels of several leaf development-associated genes were altered in nal2/3, and auxin transport-related genes were significantly changed, leading to pin mutant-like phenotypes such as more tillers and fewer lateral roots. OsWOX3A is involved in organ development in rice, lateral-axis outgrowth and vascular patterning in leaves, lemma and palea morphogenesis in spikelets, and development of tillers and lateral roots.
23597918	Formation of ethyl ferulate by rice koji enzyme in sake and mirin mash conditions.	2013	J Biosci Bioeng	Formation mechanism of ethyl ferulate (EF) in sake and mirin mash conditions was investigated to understand EF level control in the manufacturing process. Rice koji formed EF from ferulic acid (FA) and ethanol and decomposed EF to FA. This did not occur in sake yeast and chemical esterification was rare. Esterification of FA and hydrolysis of EF by rice koji might be due to feruloyl esterase(s). The rice koji enzyme showed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics for FA in ethyl esterification and for EF in hydrolysis, but not for ethanol in the esterification reaction. Substrate specificity of the rice koji enzyme for hydroxycinnamic acids suggested that the main enzyme involved might be similar to type A feruloyl esterase. We studied the rice koji enzyme properties, short-term digestion of steamed rice grains with exogenous ethanol and small scale mirin making with pH adjustment. Our results suggested differences in the esterification and hydrolysis properties of the enzyme, in particular, different pH dependencies and different behaviors under high ethanol conditions; these factors might cause the differing EF levels in sake and mirin mashes.
23620302	Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and ASR3 exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities.	2013	Mol Cells	The expression of the six rice ASR genes is differentially regulated in a tissue-dependent manner according to environmental conditions and reproductive stages. OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively. Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals. The results of quantitative real-time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model. The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice. In contrast, ABA is not a common regulator of the expression of these genes. OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA. In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively. The induction of gene expression in response to these specific hormone and sugar signals was primarily observed in the major target tissues of these genes (i.e., OsASR1 in leaves and OsASR3 in roots). Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress. Taken together, our results revealed that the transcriptional control of different rice ASR genes exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities.
23581288	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism.	2013	Plant J	It has been shown that seed development is regulated by a network of transcription factors in Arabidopsis including LEC1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON1), L1L (LEC1-like) and the B3 domain factors LEC2, FUS3 (FUSCA3) and ABI3 (ABA-INSENSITIVE3); however, molecular and genetic regulation of seed development in cereals is poorly understood. To understand seed development and seed germination in cereals, a large-scale screen was performed using our T-DNA mutant population, and a mutant germination-defective1 (gd1) was identified. In addition to the severe germination defect, the gd1 mutant also shows a dwarf phenotype and abnormal flower development. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that GD1 encodes a B3 domain-containing transcription factor with repression activity. Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA₄ level. Exogenous application of GA not only induced GD1 expression, but also partially rescued the dwarf phenotype of gd1. Furthermore, GD1 binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the gd1 mutant. Plants over-expressing OsLFL1 partly mimic the gd1 mutant. In addition, expression of GD1 was induced under sugar treatment, and the contents of starch and soluble sugar are altered in the gd1 mutant. These data indicate that GD1 participates directly or indirectly in regulating GA and carbohydrate homeostasis, and further regulates rice seed germination and seedling development.
23638826	Understanding reproductive isolation based on the rice model.	2013	Annu Rev Plant Biol	Reproductive isolation is both an indicator of speciation and a mechanism for maintaining species identity. Here we review the progress in studies of hybrid sterility in rice to illustrate the present understanding of the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. Findings from molecular characterization of genes controlling hybrid sterility can be summarized with three evolutionary genetic models. The parallel divergence model features duplicated loci generated by genome evolution; in this model, the gametes abort when the two copies of loss-of-function mutants meet in hybrids. In the sequential divergence model, mutations of two linked loci occur sequentially in one lineage, and negative interaction between the ancestral and nascent alleles of different genes causes incompatibility. The parallel-sequential divergence model involves three tightly linked loci, exemplified by a killer-protector system formed of mutations in two steps. We discuss the significance of such findings and their implications for crop improvement.
23583977	Loss of function of the IAA-glucose hydrolase gene TGW6 enhances rice grain weight and increases yield.	2013	Nat Genet	Increases in the yield of rice, a staple crop for more than half of the global population, are imperative to support rapid population growth. Grain weight is a major determining factor of yield. Here, we report the cloning and functional analysis of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 (TGW6), a gene from the Indian landrace rice Kasalath. TGW6 encodes a novel protein with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucose hydrolase activity. In sink organs, the Nipponbare tgw6 allele affects the timing of the transition from the syncytial to the cellular phase by controlling IAA supply and limiting cell number and grain length. Most notably, loss of function of the Kasalath allele enhances grain weight through pleiotropic effects on source organs and leads to significant yield increases. Our findings suggest that TGW6 may be useful for further improvements in yield characteristics in most cultivars.
23620301	OsCpn60α1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60α subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL.	2013	Mol Cells	Chaperonins are involved in protein-folding. The rice genome encodes six plastid chaperonin subunits (Cpn60) - three α and three β. Our study showed that they were differentially expressed during normal plant development. Moreover, five were induced by heat stress (42°C) but not by cold (10°C). The oscpn60α1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared. Transiently expressed OsCpn60α1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma. Immuno-blot analysis indicated that the level of Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) was severely reduced in the mutant while levels were unchanged for some imported proteins, e.g., stromal heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1 (Lhcb1). This demonstrated that OsCpn60α1 is required for the folding of rbcL and that failure of that process is seedling-lethal.
23564402	The endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by highly expressed OsrAAT reduces seed size via pre-mature programmed cell death.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	The high accumulation of a recombinant protein in rice endosperm causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and in turn dramatically affects endogenous storage protein expression, protein body morphology and seed phenotype. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in transgenic rice seeds, we analyzed the expression profiles of endogenous storage proteins, ER stress-related and programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes in transgenic lines with different levels of Oryza sativa recombinant alpha antitrypsin (OsrAAT) expression. The results indicated that OsrAAT expression induced the ER stress and that the strength of the ER stress was dependent on OsrAAT expression levels. It in turn induced upregulation of the expression of the ER stress response genes and downregulation of the expression of the endogenous storage protein genes in rice endosperm. Further experiments showed that the ER stress response upregulated the expression of PCD-related genes to disturb the rice endosperm development and induced pre-mature PCD. As consequence, it resulted in decrease of grain weight and size. The mechanisms for the detriment seed phenotype in transgenic lines with high accumulation of the recombinant protein were elucidated.
23629832	MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	The spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure of grass. The molecular mechanism that controls the development of the spikelet remains unclear. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet mutant, multi-floret spikelet1 (mfs1), that showed delayed transformation of spikelet meristems to floral meristems, which resulted in an extra hull-like organ and an elongated rachilla. In addition, the sterile lemma was homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea was degenerated in mfs1. These results suggest that the MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet meristem determinacy and floral organ identity. MFS1 belongs to an unknown function clade in the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family. The MFS1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized in the nucleus. MFS1 messenger RNA is expressed in various tissues, especially in the spikelet and floral meristems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that MFS1 positively regulates the expression of LONG STERILE LEMMA and the INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1)-like genes SUPERNUMERARY BRACT and OsIDS1.
23596187	Differential expression of three BOR1 genes corresponding to different genomes in response to boron conditions in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for plants. Efflux-type B transporters, BORs, have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Here we identified BOR1 genes encoding B efflux transporters, from the hexaploid genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We cloned three genes closely related to OsBOR1 and named them TaBOR1.1, TaBOR1.2 and TaBOR1.3. All three TaBOR1s showed B efflux activities when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells. TaBOR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins were expressed in Arabidopsis leaf cells localized in the plasma membrane. The transcript accumulation patterns of the three genes differ in terms of tissue specificity and B nutrition responses. In roots, transcripts for all three genes accumulated abundantly while in shoots, the TaBOR1.2 transcript is the most abundant, followed by those of TaBOR1.1 and TaBOR1.3. Accumulation of TaBOR1.1 transcript is up-regulated under B deficiency conditions in both roots and shoots. In contrast, TaBOR1.2 transcript accumulation significantly increased in roots under excess B conditions. TaBOR1.3 transcript accumulation was reduced under excess B. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TaBOR1s are the B efflux transporters in wheat and, interestingly, the genes on the A, B and D genomes have different expression patterns.
23580440	The influence of signals from chilled roots on the proteome of shoot tissues in rice seedlings.	2013	Proteomics	Low root temperature causes a decrease in water uptake, which leads to mineral and nutrient deficiencies with potentially decreased root and shoot growth. Differential temperature effects in plants have been studied extensively, however, the effect of root chilling on the global protein expression in shoots has not been explored. In this study, we imposed chilling temperatures on roots of rice plants while maintaining shoots at optimum atmospheric temperature. Shoot materials (growing zones and leaves) were harvested at five points over a time course of four days, including a two-day recovery period. Proteins were quantified by tandem mass tags and triple stage MS, using a method developed to overcome ratio compression in isobaric-labelled quantitation. Over 3000 proteins in each of the tissues were quantified by multiple peptides. Proteins significantly differentially expressed as compared with the control included abscisic acid-responsive and drought-associated proteins. The data also contained evidence of a possible induction of a sugar signalling pathway.
23571660	The rice MAPKK-MAPK interactome: the biological significance of MAPK components in hormone signal transduction.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are evolutionarily conserved fundamental signal transduction pathways. A MAPK cascade consists of many distinct MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK modules linked to various upstream receptors and downstream targets through sequential phosphorylation and activation of the cascade components. These cascades collaborate in transmitting a variety of extracellular signals and in controlling cellular responses and processes such as growth, differentiation, cell death, hormonal signaling, and stress responses. Although MAPK proteins play central roles in signal transduction pathways, our knowledge of MAPK signaling in hormonal responses in rice has been limited to a small subset of specific upstream and downstream interacting targets. However, recent studies revealing direct MAPK and MAPKK interactions have provided the basis for elucidating interaction specificities, functional divergence, and functional modulation during hormonal responses. In this review, we highlight current insights into MAPKK-MAPK interaction patterns in rice, with emphasis on the biological significance of these interacting pairs in SA (salicylic acid), JA (jasmonic acid), ET (ethylene), and ABA (abscisic acid) responses, and discuss the challenges in understanding functional signal transduction networks mediated by these hormones.
23621526	Response of rice to insect elicitors and the role of OsJAR1 in wound and herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	Plants produce jasmonic acid (JA) and its amino acid conjugate, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) as major defense signals in response to wounding and herbivory. In rice (Oryza sativa), JA and JA-Ile rapidly increased after mechanical damage, and this increase was further amplified when the wounds were treated with oral secretions from generalist herbivore larvae, lawn armyworms (Spodoptera mauritia), revealing for the first time active perception mechanisms of herbivore-associated elicitor(s) in rice. In the rice genome, two OsJAR genes can conjugate JA and Ile and form JA-Ile in vitro; however, their function in herbivory-induced accumulation of JA-Ile has not been investigated. By functional characterization of TOS17 retrotransposon-tagged Osjar1 plants and their response to simulated herbivory, we show that OsJAR1 is essential for JA-Ile production in herbivore-attacked, field-grown plants. In addition, OsJAR1 was required for normal seed development in rice under field conditions. Our results suggest that OsJAR1 possesses at least two major functions in rice defense and development that cannot be complemented by the additional OsJAR2 gene function, although this gene previously showed overlapping enzyme activity in vitro.
23628996	α-tubulin is rapidly phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress in rice and Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	By using high-resolution two-dimensional PAGE followed by phosphoprotein-specific staining and peptide mass fingerprint analysis along with other assays, we found that α-tubulin is phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress in rice and Arabidopsis. The onset of the phosphorylation response was as early as 2 min after hyperosmotic stress treatment, and a major proportion of α-tubulin was phosphorylated after 60 min in root tissues. However, the phosphorylated form of α-tubulin was readily dephosphorylated upon stress removal. The phosphorylation site was identified as Thr349 by comprehensive mutagenesis of serine/threonine residues in a rice α-tubulin isoform followed by evaluation in cultured cell protoplasts. This residue is located at the surface for the interaction with β-tubulin in polymerized α-β tubulin dimers and has been proposed to be directly involved in this interaction. Thus, α-tubulin phosphorylation was considered to occur on free tubulin dimers in response to hyperosmotic stress. The incorporation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-α-tubulin into cortical microtubules was completely inhibited in transgenic Arabidopsis when Thr349 was substituted with glutamate or aspartate. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GFP-α-tubulin, we found that hyperosmotic stress causes extensive cortical microtubule depolymerization. Microtubule-destabilizing treatments such as propyzamide or oryzalin and temperature stresses resulted in α-tubulin phosphorylation, whereas hyperosmotic stress-induced α-tubulin phosphorylation was partially inhibited by taxol, which stabilizes microtubules. These results and the three-dimensional location of the phosphorylation site suggested that microtubules are depolymerized in response to hyperosmotic stress via α-tubulin phosphorylation. Together, the results of the present study reveal a novel mechanism that globally regulates the microtubule polymerization.
23563801	Differential requirement of Oryza sativa RAR1 in immune receptor-mediated resistance of rice to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Mol Cells	The required for Mla12 resistance (RAR1) protein is essential for the plant immune response. In rice, a model monocot species, the function of Oryza sativa RAR1 (OsRAR1) has been little explored. In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. osrar1 mutants displayed reduced resistance compared with wild type rice when inoculated with the normally virulent M. oryzae isolate PO6-6, indicating that OsRAR1 is required for an immune response to this pathogen. We also investigated the function of OsRAR1 in the resistance mechanism mediated by the immune receptor genes Pib and Pi5 that encode nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. We inoculated progeny from Pib/osrar1 and Pi5/osrar1 heterozygous plants with the avirulent M. oryzae isolates, race 007 and PO6-6, respectively. We found that only Pib-mediated resistance was compromised by the osrar1 mutation and that the introduction of the OsRAR1 cDNA into Pib/osrar1 rescued Pib-mediated resistance. These results indicate that OsRAR1 is required for Pib-mediated resistance but not Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.
23580596	A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm.	2013	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) glutelins are synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum as a precursor, which are then transported via the Golgi to protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), where they are proteolytically processed into acidic and basic subunits. The glutelin precursor mutant6 (glup6) accumulates abnormally large amounts of proglutelin. Map-base cloning studies showed that glup6 was a loss-of-function mutant of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates Rab GTPase, a key regulator of membrane trafficking. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the transport of proglutelins and α-globulins to PSV was disrupted in glup6 endosperm. Secreted granules of glutelin and α-globulin were readily observed in young glup6 endosperm, followed by the formation of large dilated paramural bodies (PMBs) containing both proteins as the endosperm matures. The PMBs also contained membrane biomarkers for the Golgi and prevacuolar compartment as well as the cell wall component, β-glucan. Direct evidence was gathered showing that GLUP6/GEF activated in vitro GLUP4/Rab5 as well as several Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Rab5 isoforms to the GTP-bound form. Therefore, loss-of-function mutations in GEF or Rab5 disrupt the normal transport of proglutelin from the Golgi to PSVs, resulting in the initial extracellular secretion of these proteins followed, in turn, by the formation of PMBs. Overall, our results indicate that GLUP6/GEF is the activator of Rab5 GTPase and that the cycling of GTP- and GDP-bound forms of this regulatory protein is essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin and α-globulin from the Golgi to PSVs and in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in rice seeds.
23591078	Anoxia promotes gravitropic curvature in rice pulvini but inhibits it in wheat and oat pulvini.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Gravitropic curvature of pulvini of wheat and oat stem segments gradually declined with decreasing atmospheric O₂ concentration and was almost completely blocked under anoxia, whereas that of rice stem segments was enhanced under hypoxia and anoxia. Anoxia substantially increased the ethanol content in pulvini of gravistimulated stem segments in rice, wheat and oat, but the ethanol content showed no marked difference between rice pulvini and wheat and oat pulvini. The concentrations of exogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde required to inhibit the gravitropic curvature of pulvini were significantly higher in rice segments than in wheat and oat segments. However, in all three species, the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde required to completely inhibit curvature were several-fold higher than the endogenous levels that accumulated in pulvini gravistimulated in N₂. The pulvini of rice segments gravistimulated in N₂ did not contain much more ATP than those of wheat or oat segments gravistimulated in N₂. When applied unilaterally to the pulvini of vertically oriented stem segments incubated in N₂, indole-3-acetic acid induced bending in rice stem segments but not in wheat and oat stem segments. Transference of graviresponsive pulvini of rice, as well as those of wheat and oat, from aerobic conditions to anaerobic conditions led to cessation of gravitropic curvature within several minutes, but subsequently only gravitropic curvature of anoxic rice pulvini was completely recovered within 2 h. A large portion of this recovery was blocked by cordycepin, a transcription inhibitor. These results suggested that anoxia-induced expression of any gene or genes enables rice pulvini to respond to gravistimulation under anaerobic conditions, and that such a gene or genes might be unrelated to ethanol fermentation and ATP production in anaerobic conditions.
23606413	Polyamines and ethylene interact in rice grains in response to soil drying during grain filling.	2013	J Exp Bot	This study tested the hypothesis that the interaction between polyamines and ethylene may mediate the effects of soil drying on grain filling of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two rice cultivars were pot grown. Three treatments, well-watered, moderate soil drying (MD), and severe soil drying (SD), were imposed from 8 d post-anthesis until maturity. The endosperm cell division rate, grain-filling rate, and grain weight of earlier flowering superior spikelets showed no significant differences among the three treatments. However, those of the later flowering inferior spikelets were significantly increased under MD and significantly reduced under SD when compared with those which were well watered. The two cultivars showed the same tendencies. MD increased the contents of free spermidine (Spd) and free spermine (Spm), the activities of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase and Spd synthase, and expression levels of polyamine synthesis genes, and decreased the ethylene evolution rate, the contents of 1-aminocylopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and hydrogen peroxide, the activities of ACC synthase, ACC oxidase, and polyamine oxidase, and the expression levels of ethylene synthesis genes in inferior spikelets. SD exhibited the opposite effects. Application of Spd, Spm, or an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis to rice panicles significantly reduced ethylene and ACC levels, but significantly increased Spd and Spm contents, grain-filling rate, and grain weight of inferior spikelets. The results were reversed when ACC or an inhibitor of Spd and Spm synthesis was applied. The results suggest that a potential metabolic interaction between polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis responds to soil drying and mediates the grain filling of inferior spikelets in rice.
23509111	Cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 is responsible for the primary assimilation of ammonium in rice roots.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Among three genes for cytosolic glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants, the OsGS1;2 gene is known to be mainly expressed in surface cells of roots, but its function was not clearly understood. We characterized knock-out mutants caused by the insertion of an endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 into exon 2 of OsGS1;2. Homozygously inserted mutants showed severe reduction in active tiller number and hence panicle number at harvest. Other yield components, such as spikelet number per panicle, 1,000-spikelet weight and proportion of well ripened grains, were nearly identical between the mutants and wild-type plants. When the contents of free amino acids in roots were compared between the mutants and the wild type, there were marked reductions in contents of glutamine, glutamate, asparagine and aspartate, but a remarkable increase in free ammonium ions in the mutants. Concentrations of amino acids and ammonium ions in xylem sap behaved in a similar fashion. Re-introduction of OsGS1;2 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the knock-out mutants successfully restored yield components to wild-type levels as well as ammonium concentration in xylem sap. The results indicate that GS1;2 is important in the primary assimilation of ammonium ions taken up by rice roots, with GS1;1 in the roots unable to compensate for GS1;2 functions.
23601108	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	2013	Cell Host Microbe	OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a "defensome" critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.
23586618	DNA replication arrest leads to enhanced homologous recombination and cell death in meristems of rice OsRecQl4 mutants.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Mammalian BLM helicase is involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR). These DNA transactions are associated tightly with cell division and are important for maintaining genome stability. However, unlike in mammals, cell division in higher plants is restricted mainly to the meristem, thus genome maintenance at the meristem is critical. The counterpart of BLM in Arabidopsis (AtRecQ4A) has been identified and its role in HR and in the response to DNA damage has been confirmed. However, the function of AtRecQ4A in the meristem during replication stress has not yet been well elucidated.

RESULTS: We isolated the BLM counterpart gene OsRecQl4 from rice and analyzed its function using a reverse genetics approach. Osrecql4 mutant plants showed hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and enhanced frequency of HR compared to wild-type (WT) plants. We further analyzed the effect of aphidicolin--an inhibitor of S-phase progression via its inhibitory effect on DNA polymerases--on genome stability in the root meristem in osrecql4 mutant plants and corresponding WT plants. The following effects were observed upon aphidicolin treatment: a) comet assay showed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mutant plants, b) TUNEL assay showed enhanced DNA breaks at the root meristem in mutant plants, c) a recombination reporter showed enhanced HR frequency in mutant calli, d) propidium iodide (PI) staining of root tips revealed an increased incidence of cell death in the meristem of mutant plants.

CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the aphidicolin-sensitive phenotype of osrecql4 mutants was in part due to induced DSBs and cell death, and that OsRecQl4 plays an important role as a caretaker, maintaining genome stability during DNA replication stress in the rice meristem.
23551455	Transgenic rice seed synthesizing diverse flavonoids at high levels: a new platform for flavonoid production with associated health benefits.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Flavonoids possess diverse health-promoting benefits but are nearly absent from rice, because most of the genes encoding enzymes for flavonoid biosynthesis are not expressed in rice seeds. In the present study, a transgenic rice plant producing several classes of flavonoids in seeds was developed by introducing multiple genes encoding enzymes involved in flavonoid synthesis, from phenylalanine to the target flavonoids, into rice. Rice accumulating naringenin was developed by introducing phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. Rice producing other classes of flavonoids, kaempferol, genistein, and apigenin, was developed by introducing, together with PAL and CHS, genes encoding flavonol synthase/flavanone-3-hydroxylase, isoflavone synthase, and flavone synthases, respectively. The endosperm-specific GluB-1 promoter or embryo- and aleurone-specific 18-kDa oleosin promoters were used to express these biosynthetic genes in seed. The target flavonoids of naringenin, kaempferol, genistein, and apigenin were highly accumulated in each transgenic rice, respectively. Furthermore, tricin was accumulated by introducing hydroxylase and methyltransferase, demonstrating that modification to flavonoid backbones can be also well manipulated in rice seeds. The flavonoids accumulated as both aglycones and several types of glycosides, and flavonoids in the endosperm were deposited into PB-II-type protein bodies. Therefore, these rice seeds provide an ideal platform for the production of particular flavonoids due to efficient glycosylation, the presence of appropriate organelles for flavonoid accumulation, and the small effect of endogenous enzymes on the production of flavonoids by exogenous enzymes.
23589438	Multi-generational effects of rice harboring Bph15 on brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, is one of the most devastating rice pests in Asia. Resistant cultivars are an effective way of managing BPH. Bph15 is a BPH resistance gene and has been introgressed into rice variety Minghui 63 (MH63). The multi-generational effects of rice line MH63::15 (harboring Bph15) on BPH were investigated and compared with its parental line MH63.

RESULTS: U-test analysis indicated that, over seven generations, the developmental duration of BPH nymphs was significantly prolonged by MH63::15. The results of a two-way analysis indicated that, over seven generations, MH63::15 had significant negative effects on the hatchability, emergence rate, copulation rate, weight of adults and fecundity of BPH, but no significant effects on the survival rate of nymphs or female ratio of BPH. In addition, the development of ovary was significantly retarded by MH63::15, and the expression of oogenesis genes were either down-regulated (three genes) or up-regulated (one genes) by MH63::15 compared with MH63.

CONCLUSIONS: After being reared continuously on MH63::15 for seven generations, most of the life parameters of BPH were negatively affected by MH63::15, especially fecundity and ovary development. These results indicate that MH63::15 rice has potential for use in the control of BPH.
23629836	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (cap1), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa). The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains. The abnormal pollen grains lacked almost all cytoplasmic materials, nuclei, and intine cell walls and did not germinate. Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth. CAP1 encodes a protein consisting of 996 amino acids that showed high similarity to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) l-arabinokinase, which catalyzes the conversion of l-arabinose to l-arabinose 1-phosphate. A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains. During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage. Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate. The expression pattern of CAP1 was very similar to that of another Arabidopsis homolog that showed 71% amino acid identity with CAP1. Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.
23624440	Characterization and fine mapping of the rice premature senescence mutant ospse1.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Premature senescence can limit crop productivity by limiting the growth phase. In the present study, a spontaneous premature senescence mutant was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genetic analysis revealed that the premature senescence phenotype was controlled by a recessive mutation, which we named Oryza sativa premature senescence1 (ospse1). The ospse1 mutants showed premature leaf senescence from the booting stage and exhibited more severe symptoms during reproductive and ripening stages. Key yield-related agronomic traits such as 1,000-grain weight and seed-setting rate, but not panicle grain number, were significantly reduced in ospse1 plants. Chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate of ospse1 flag leaves were similar to the wild-type plants in vegetative stages, but these parameters decreased steeply in the mutant after the heading stage. Consistent with this, the senescence-associated genes OsNYC1 and OsSgr were up-regulated in ospse1 mutant during premature leaf senescence. The ospse1 locus was mapped to a 38-kb region on chromosome 1 and sequence analysis of this region identified a single-nucleotide deletion in the 3' region of an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative pectate lyase, leading to a frame shift and a longer ORF. Our results suggested that the premature senescence of the ospse1 may be regulated by a novel mechanism mediated by pectate lyase.
23548743	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding.	2013	Plant Cell	Resistance (R) proteins recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins by direct or indirect binding and are multidomain proteins generally carrying a nucleotide binding (NB) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39. RGA4 and RGA5 also mediate recognition of the unrelated M. oryzae effector AVR-Pia, indicating that the corresponding R proteins possess dual recognition specificity. For RGA5, two alternative transcripts, RGA5-A and RGA5-B, were identified. Genetic analysis showed that only RGA5-A confers resistance, while RGA5-B is inactive. Yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging experiments revealed direct binding of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 to RGA5-A, providing evidence for the recognition of multiple Avr proteins by direct binding to a single R protein. Direct binding seems to be required for resistance as an inactive AVR-Pia allele did not bind RGA5-A. A small Avr interaction domain with homology to the Avr recognition domain in the rice R protein Pik-1 was identified in the C terminus of RGA5-A. This reveals a mode of Avr protein recognition through direct binding to a novel, non-LRR interaction domain.
23571674	Comprehensive analysis of the rice RING E3 ligase family reveals their functional diversity in response to abiotic stress.	2013	DNA Res	A large number of really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligases contribute to the post-translational modification of target proteins during plant responses to environmental stresses. However, the physical interactome of RING E3 ligases in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression patterns of 47 Oryza sativa RING finger protein (OsRFP) genes in response to abiotic stresses via semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in silico analysis. Subsequently, molecular dissection of nine OsRFPs was performed by the examination of their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, subcellular localization, and physical interaction with target proteins. Most of the OsRFPs examined possessed E3 ligase activity and showed diverse subcellular localization. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was then employed to construct a physical interaction map of seven OsRFPs with their 120 interacting proteins. The results indicated that these OsRFPs required dynamic translocation and partitioning for their cellular activation. Heterogeneous overexpression of each of the OsRFP genes in Arabidopsis suggested that they have functionally diverse responses to abiotic stresses, which may have been acquired during evolution. This comprehensive study provides insights into the biological functions of OsRFPs, which may be useful in understanding how rice plants adapt to unfavourable environmental conditions.
23575418	Preferential delivery of zinc to developing tissues in rice is mediated by P-type heavy metal ATPase OsHMA2.	2013	Plant Physiol	Developing tissues such as meristems and reproductive organs require high zinc, but the molecular mechanisms of how zinc taken up by the roots is preferentially delivered to these tissues with low transpiration are unknown. Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase2 (OsHMA2), a member of P-type ATPases, is involved in preferential delivery of zinc to the developing tissues in rice. OsHMA2 was mainly expressed in the mature zone of the roots at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the nodes at the reproductive stage. The expression was unaffected by either zinc deficiency or zinc excess. OsHMA2 was localized at the pericycle of the roots and at the phloem of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes. Heterologous expression of OsHMA2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed influx transport activity for zinc as well as cadmium. Two independent Tos17 insertion lines showed decreased zinc concentration in the crown root tips, decreased concentration of zinc and cadmium in the upper nodes and reproductive organs compared with wild-type rice. Furthermore, a short-term labeling experiment with (67)Zn showed that the distribution of zinc to the panicle and uppermost node I was decreased, but that, to the lower nodes, was increased in the two mutants. Taken together, OsHMA2 in the nodes plays an important role in preferential distribution of zinc as well as cadmium through the phloem to the developing tissues.
23566853	Improvement of phosphorus efficiency in rice on the basis of understanding phosphate signaling and homeostasis.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Rice is one of the most important cereal crops feeding a large segment of the world's population. Inefficient utilization of phosphate (Pi) fertilizer by the plant in rice production increases cost and pollution. Developing cultivars with improved Pi use efficiency is essential for the sustainability of agriculture. Pi uptake, translocation and remobilization are regulated by complex molecular mechanisms through the functions of Pi transporters (PTs) and other downstream Pi Starvation Induced (PSI) genes. Expressions of these PSI genes are regulated by the Pi Starvation Response Regulator (OsPHR2)-mediated transcriptional control and/or PHO2-mediated ubiquitination. SPX-domain containing proteins and the type I H(+)-PPase AVP1 involved in the maintenance and utilization of the internal phosphate. The potential application of posttranscriptional regulation of PT1 through OsPHF1 for Pi efficiency is proposed.
23566873	Cobalt chloride-induced lateral root formation in rice: the role of heme oxygenase.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Lateral roots (LRs) perform the essential tasks of providing water, nutrients, and physical support to plants. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. Recent findings suggest that heme oxygenase (HO) plays an important role in LR development. In this study, we examined the effect of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) on LR formation and HO expression in rice. Treatment with CoCl2 induced LR formation and HO activity. We further observed that CoCl2 could induce the expression of OsHO1 but not OsHO2. CoCl2-increased HO activity occurred before LR formation. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX, the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin (the carbon monoxide/nitric oxide scavenger) reduced LR formation, HO activity, and OsHO1 expression. Application of biliverdin, a product of HO-catalyzed reaction, to CoCl2-treated rice seedlings reversed the ZnPPIX-inhibited LR formation and ZnPPIX-decreased HO activity. CoCl2 had no effect on H2O2 content and nitric oxide production. Moreover, application of ascorbate, a H2O2 scavenger, failed to affect CoCl2-promoted LR formation and HO activity. It is concluded that HO is required for CoCl2-promoted LR formation in rice.
23070916	Characterization of a vacuolar zinc transporter OZT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Mol Biol Rep	The CDF family is a ubiquitous family that has been identified in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Members of this family are important heavy metal transporters that transport metal ions out of the cytoplasm. In this research, a full length cDNA named Oryza sativa Zn Transporter 1 (OZT1) that closely related to rat ZnT-2 (Zn Transporter 2) gene was isolated from rice. The OZT1 encoding a CDF family protein shares 28.2 % ~ 84.3 % of identities and 49.3 % ~ 90.9 % of similarities with other zinc transporters such as RnZnT-2, HsZnT-8, RnZnT-8 and AtMTP1. OZT1 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues. The OZT1 expression was significantly induced both in the seedlings of japonica rice Nipponbare and indica rice IR26 in response to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) treatments. Besides, OZT1 expression was also increased when exposed to other excess metals, such as Cu(2+), Fe(2+) and Mg(2+). Subcellular localization analysis indicated that OZT1 localized to vacuole. Heterologous expression of OZT1 in yeast increased tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress but not the Mg(2+) stress. Together, OZT1 is a CDF family vacuolar zinc transporter conferring tolerance to Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) stress, which is important to transporting and homeostasis of Zn, Cd or other heavy metals in plants.
23071218	Enhancing phosphorus and zinc acquisition efficiency in rice: a critical review of root traits and their potential utility in rice breeding.	2013	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND: Rice is the world's most important cereal crop and phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) deficiency are major constraints to its production. Where fertilizer is applied to overcome these nutritional constraints it comes at substantial cost to farmers and the efficiency of fertilizer use is low. Breeding crops that are efficient at acquiring P and Zn from native soil reserves or fertilizer sources has been advocated as a cost-effective solution, but would benefit from knowledge of genes and mechanisms that confer enhanced uptake of these nutrients by roots.

SCOPE: This review discusses root traits that have been linked to P and Zn uptake in rice, including traits that increase mobilization of P/Zn from soils, increase the volume of soil explored by roots or root surface area to recapture solubilized nutrients, enhance the rate of P/Zn uptake across the root membrane, and whole-plant traits that affect root growth and nutrient capture. In particular, this review focuses on the potential for these traits to be exploited through breeding programmes to produce nutrient-efficient crop cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS: Few root traits have so far been used successfully in plant breeding for enhanced P and Zn uptake in rice or any other crop. Insufficient genotypic variation for traits or the failure to enhance nutrient uptake under realistic field conditions are likely reasons for the limited success. More emphasis is needed on field studies in mapping populations or association panels to identify those traits and underlying genes that are able to enhance nutrient acquisition beyond the level already present in most cultivars.
23064615	Identification of QTLs associated with tissue culture response through sequencing-based genotyping of RILs derived from 93-11 × Nipponbare in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : The performance of callus induction and callus differentiation was evaluated by 9 indices for 140 RILs; 2 major QTLs associated with plant regeneration were identified. In order to investigate the genetic mechanisms of tissue culture response, 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 93-11 (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) × Nipponbare (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) and a high quality genetic map based on the SNPs generated from deep sequencing of the RIL genomes, were used to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with in vitro tissue culture response (TCR) from mature seed in rice. The performance of callus induction was evaluated by indices of induced-callus color (ICC), induced-callus size (ICS), induced-callus friability (ICF) and callus induction rate (CIR), respectively, and the performance of callus differentiation was evaluated by indices of callus proliferation ability (CPA), callus browning tendency (CBT), callus greening ability (CGA), the average number of regenerated shoots per callus (NRS) and regeneration rate (%, RR), respectively. A total of 25 QTLs, 2 each for ICC, ICS, ICF, CIR and CBA, 3 for CPA, 4 each for CGA, NRS and RR, respectively, were detected and located on 8 rice chromosomes. Significant correlations were observed among the traits of CGA, NRS and RR, and QTLs identified for these three indices were co-located on chromosomes 3 and 7, and the additive effects came from both Nipponbare and 93-11, respectively. The results obtained from this study provide guidance for further fine mapping and gene cloning of the major QTL of TCR and the knowledge of the genes underlying the traits investigated would be very helpful for revealing the molecular bases of tissue culture response.
23026817	Sequential monitoring of transgene expression following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Although Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology is now used widely in rice, many varieties of indica-type rice are still recalcitrant to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. It was reported recently that T-DNA integration into the rice genome could be the limiting step in this method. Here, we attempted to establish an efficient sequential monitoring system for stable transformation events by visualizing stable transgene expression using a non-destructive and highly sensitive visible marker. Our results demonstrate that click beetle luciferase (ELuc) is an excellent marker allowing the observation of transformed cells in rice callus, exhibiting a sensitivity >30-fold higher than that of firefly luciferase. Since we have previously shown that green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a useful visual marker with which to follow transient and/or stable expression of transgenes in rice, we constructed an enhancer trap vector using both the gfbsd2 (GFP fused to the N-terminus of blasticidin S deaminase) and eluc genes. In this vector, the eluc gene is under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S minimal promoter, while the gfbsd2 gene is under the control of the full-length rice elongation factor gene promoter. Observation of transformed callus under a dissecting microscope demonstrated that the level of ELuc luminescence reflected exclusively stable transgene expression, and that both transient and stable expression could be monitored by the level of GFP fluorescence. Moreover, we show that our system enables sequential quantification of transgene expression via differential measurement of ELuc luminescence and GFP fluorescence.
22922107	Photosynthetic and physiological analysis of the rice high-chlorophyll mutant (Gc).	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Chlorophyll (Chl) molecules are essential for harvesting light energy in photosynthesis. A rice high-chlorophyll mutant (Gc) with significantly increased Chl b was identified previously in Zhenshan 97B (Oryza sativa indica). However, the mechanism underlying this higher Chl b content and its effects on photosynthetic efficiency are still unclear. Immunoblot and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) with a second dimension electrophoresis followed by the matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis showed that a few core proteins of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) proteins were overexpressed in the mutant plants. Remarkable differences in chloroplast ultrastructure were observed between the wild-type and mutant plants, with the latter having more highly stacked and larger grana. Chl florescence analysis demonstrated that Gc had markedly increased quantum efficiency of photosystem II (ΦPSII), photochemical quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching (qN) and electron transport rate (ETR). This morphological and physiological adaptation might confer a higher photosynthetic capacity in Gc than the wild-type.
23180670	Inactivation of OsIRX10 leads to decreased xylan content in rice culm cell walls and improved biomass saccharification.	2013	Mol Plant	
23017909	OsMIOX, a myo-inositol oxygenase gene, improves drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Sci	Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), a unique monooxygenase, catalyzes the oxidation of myo-inositol to d-glucuronic acid. However, the protective role of MIOX in plants against oxidative stress or drought stress remains unknown. In this study, the functional characterization of MIOX obtained from the cDNA library of upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IRAT109), was performed. OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H₂O₂, salt, cold and abscisic acid. The transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsMIOX showed obviously improved growth performance in the medium containing 200 mM mannitol. Further, the survival rate of leaves from the transgenic rice lines was significantly higher than that of the wild type plants under polyethylene glycol treatment. It was discovered that the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes and proline content, as well as the transcript levels of many ROS scavenging genes were significantly increased in transgenic plants compared to the wild type plants under drought stress conditions. Together, these data suggest that OsMIOX has a specific function in drought stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage.
23251593	Comparative transcriptome profiling of the early response to Magnaporthe oryzae in durable resistant vs susceptible rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes.	2012	PLoS One	Durable resistance to blast, the most significant fungal disease of rice, represents an agronomically relevant character. Gigante Vercelli (GV) and Vialone Nano (VN) are two old temperate japonica Italian rice cultivars with contrasting response to blast infection: GV displays durable and broad resistance while VN is highly susceptible. RNA-seq was used to dissect the early molecular processes deployed during the resistance response of GV at 24 h after blast inoculation. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1,070 and 1,484 modulated genes, of which 726 and 699 were up regulated in response to infection in GV and VN, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed a set of GO terms enriched in both varieties but, despite this commonality, the gene sets contributing to common GO enriched terms were dissimilar. The expression patterns of genes grouped in GV-specific enriched GO terms were examined in detail including at the transcript isoform level. GV exhibited a dramatic up-regulation of genes encoding diterpene phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes, flavin-containing monooxygenase, class I chitinase and glycosyl hydrolase 17. The sensitivity and high dynamic range of RNA-seq allowed the identification of genes critically involved in conferring GV resistance during the early steps of defence perception-signalling. These included chitin oligosaccharides sensing factors, wall associated kinases, MAPK cascades and WRKY transcription factors. Candidate genes with expression patterns consistent with a potential role as GV-specific functional resistance (R) gene(s) were also identified. This first application of RNA-seq to dissect durable blast resistance supports a crucial role of the prompt induction of a battery of responses including defence-related genes as well as members of gene families involved in signalling and pathogen-related gene expression regulation.
23131380	The effect of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) in dyslipidemia and other disorders.	2012	Complement Ther Med	BACKGROUND: Red Yeast Rice (RYR) is a traditional Chinese food that is fermented and obtained after red yeast (Monascus purpureus) is grown on rice. RYR contains Monacolin K (Lovastatin) and other active ingredients that are thought to play a role in the management of cholesterol levels. Recently, many clinical trials have focused on the uses of RYR, including for dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fatigue, and memory.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of RYR on the management of dyslipidemia. The secondary objective is to review studies that focus on the other uses of RYR. The following search terms were used: red yeast rice, Xuezhikang, Hypocol, Cholestin, Monascus purpureus combined with dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, lipid, cardiovascular, coronary, atherosclerosis, diabetes, sugar, bone, osteoporosis, liver, fatigue, memory, Alzheimer's, dementia.

RESULTS: Studies reviewed show that RYR significantly lowered LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. Effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were also observed in some studies. Compared with statins, RYR was shown to have an equal efficacy to statins when combined with or without other dietary supplements. RYR also appeared to be superior to placebo in preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction, total coronary heart disease events, and total deaths. On the other hand, information on diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fatigue, and memory are currently limited although in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an effect.

CONCLUSION: Results of RYR clinical trials presented here have limitations and RYR's clinical use should be further investigated before using RYR as one of the alternative treatments for dyslipidemia management, despite the fact that the strongest evidence for RYR use is in dyslipidemia versus other clinical conditions.
23397013	Plant growth-promoting traits of biocontrol potential bacteria isolated from rice rhizosphere.	2012	Springerplus	Seven isolates of bacteria (SRI-156, SRI-158, SRI-178, SRI-211, SRI-229, SRI-305 and SRI-360) were earlier reported by us as having potential for biocontrol of charcoal rot of sorghum and plant growth promotion (PGP) of the plant. In the present study, the seven isolates were characterized for their physiological traits (tolerance to salinity, pH, temperature and resistance to antibiotics and fungicides) and further evaluated in the field for their PGP of rice. All the seven isolates were able to grow at pH values between 5 and 13, in NaCl concentrations of up to 8% (except SRI-156 and SRI-360), temperatures between 20 and 40°C and were resistant to ampicillin (>100 ppm; except SRI-158 and SRI-178) but sensitive (<10 ppm) to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin (except SRI-156 and SRI-211) and tetracycline. They were tolerant to fungicides benlate and captan, except SRI-158 and SRI-178, bavistin and sensitive to thiram (except SRI-156 and SRI-211) at field application level. In the field, four of the seven isolates (SRI-158, SRI-211, SRI-229 and SRI-360) significantly enhanced the tiller numbers, stover and grain yields, total dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight over the un-inoculated control. In the rhizosphere soil at harvest, all the isolates significantly enhanced microbial biomass carbon (except SRI-156), microbial biomass nitrogen and dehydrogenase activity (up to 33%, 36% and 39%, respectively) and total N, available P and% organic carbon (up to 10%, 38% and 10%, respectively) compared to the control. This investigation further confirms that the SRI isolates have PGP properties.
23271017	Genomewide analysis of intronic microRNAs in rice and Arabidopsis.	2012	J Genet	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene transcription and posttranscriptional processes. The majority of miRNAs are localized within intronic regions of protein-coding genes (host genes) and have diverse functions in regulating important cellular processes in animals. To date, few plant intronic miRNAs have been studied functionally. Here we report a comprehensive computational analysis to characterize intronic miRNAs in rice and Arabidopsis. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the identified intronic miRNAs were derived from the real introns of host genes. Interestingly, 13 intronic miRNAs in rice and two in Arabidopsis were located within seven clusters, of which four polycistronic clusters contain miRNAs derived from different families, suggesting that these clustered intronic miRNAs might be involved in extremely complex regulation in rice. Length analysis of miRNA-carrying introns, promoter prediction and qRT-PCR analysis results indicated that intronic miRNAs are coexpressed with their host genes. Expression pattern analysis demonstrated that host genes had a very broad expression spectrum in different stages of development, suggesting the intronic miRNAs might play an important role in plant development. This comparative genomics analysis of intronic miRNAs in rice and Arabidopsis provides new insight into the functions and regulatory mechanisms of intronic miRNAs in monocots and dicots.
23236132	Rare allele of OsPPKL1 associated with grain length causes extra-large grain and a significant yield increase in rice.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Grain size and shape are important components determining rice grain yield, and they are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a major grain length QTL, qGL3, which encodes a putative protein phosphatase with Kelch-like repeat domain (OsPPKL1). We found a rare allele qgl3 that leads to a long grain phenotype by an aspartate-to-glutamate transition in a conserved AVLDT motif of the second Kelch domain in OsPPKL1. The rice genome has other two OsPPKL1 homologs, OsPPKL2 and OsPPKL3. Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator. The Kelch domains are essential for the OsPPKL1 biological function. Field trials showed that the application of the qgl3 allele could significantly increase grain yield in both inbred and hybrid rice varieties, due to its favorable effect on grain length, filling, and weight.
23258571	A dominant major locus in chromosome 9 of rice (Oryza sativa L.) confers tolerance to 48°C high temperature at seedling stage.	2013	J Hered	In an earlier greenhouse screening, we identified a local indica cultivar HT54 tolerant to high temperature at both seedling and grain-filling stages. In this study, we develop an optimized procedure for fine assessment of this heat tolerance. The results indicated that HT54 seedlings could tolerate high temperature up to 48 °C for 79h. The genetic analysis of F(1) and F(2) offspring derived from the cross between HT54 and HT13, a heat-sensitive breeding line, reveals that the heat tolerance of HT54 was controlled by a dominant major locus, which has been designated as OsHTAS (Oryza sativa heat tolerance at seedling stage). This locus was mapped on rice chromosome 9 within an interval of 420kb between markers of InDel5 and RM7364. The determined candidate ZFP gene has been confirmed to be cosegregated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) developed PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marker RBsp1407 in its promoter region. Another heat tolerance-associated SNP was identified in the first intron of its 5'-untranslated region. The existence of these SNPs thereby indicated that the OsHTAS locus contains at least two alleles. We named the one from HT54 as OsHTAS ( a ) and the one from HT13 as OsHTAS ( b ). Further dynamic expression analysis demonstrated that OsHTAS ( a ) was actively responsive to 45 °C high temperature stress compared with the OsHTAS ( b ) allele.
23279104	Metabolic engineering and profiling of rice with increased lysine.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Lysine (Lys) is the first limiting essential amino acid in rice, a stable food for half of the world population. Efforts, including genetic engineering, have not achieved a desirable level of Lys in rice. Here, we genetically engineered rice to increase Lys levels by expressing bacterial lysine feedback-insensitive aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHPS) to enhance Lys biosynthesis; through RNA interference of rice lysine ketoglutaric acid reductase/saccharopine dehydropine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH) to down-regulate its catabolism; and by combined expression of AK and DHPS and interference of LKR/SDH to achieve both metabolic effects. In these transgenic plants, free Lys levels increased up to ~12-fold in leaves and ~60-fold in seeds, substantially greater than the 2.5-fold increase in transgenic rice seeds reported by the only previous related study. To better understand the metabolic regulation of Lys accumulation in rice, metabolomic methods were employed to analyse the changes in metabolites of the Lys biosynthesis and catabolism pathways in leaves and seeds at different stages. Free Lys accumulation was mainly regulated by its biosynthesis in leaves and to a greater extent by catabolism in seeds. The transgenic plants did not show observable changes in plant growth and seed germination nor large changes in levels of asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) in leaves, which are the major amino acids transported into seeds. Although Lys was highly accumulated in leaves of certain transgenic lines, a corresponding higher Lys accumulation was not observed in seeds, suggesting that free Lys transport from leaves into seeds did not occur.
23630446	Endosulfan-induced biomarkers in Japanese rice fish (Oryzias latipes) analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS.	2013	Int J Biol Sci	The objective of this study was to find and validate estrogen-related biomarkers from plasma proteins in Oryzias latipes after exposure to an estrogen disrupting compound, α-endosulfan. The acute toxicity of α-endosulfan on O. latipes after 96 h of exposure was 13.72, 16.18, and 22.18 μg L(-1) for the LC10, LC20, and LC50 values, respectively. To confirm estrogenic disturbance by α-endosulfan, the expression level of vitellogenin in the liver of male fishes was measured at the LC10 value, and it was found to be significantly different from the reference group, confirming the estrogenic effect of endosulfan in this concentration range. Proteinchip® array techniques using a weak cation exchange (CM10) and a strong anion exchange proteinchip (Q10) in conjunction with surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) were used to determine plasma proteins of O. latipes differently expressed in response to endosulfan exposure at LC10 and LC20 concentrations. Analysis of protein profiling of the male fish exposed to α-endosulfan detected 48 significantly different protein peaks and the proteins at m/z 2819, 8462, 8860, and 9462 were significantly different (p<0.05). The protein peaks at m/z 2819, 8860, and 9462 were up-regulated and the peak at m/z 8462 was down-regulated. Therefore, these four differentially expressed proteins could be used as biomarkers to rapidly determine a possible risk of endosulfan on aquatic ecosystems, although these are not necessarily produced as a result of endocrine disruption.
23468992	Gene knockout study reveals that cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 2(OsAPX2) plays a critical role in growth and reproduction in rice under drought, salt and cold stresses.	2013	PLoS One	Plant ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), enzymes catalyzing the dismutation of H2O2 into H2O and O2, play an important role in reactive oxygen species homeostasis in plants. The rice genome has eight OsAPXs, but their physiological functions remain to be determined. In this report, we studied the function of OsAPX2 gene using a T-DNA knockout mutant under the treatment of drought, salt and cold stresses. The Osapx2 knockout mutant was isolated by a genetic screening of a rice T-DNA insertion library under 20% PEG-2000 treatment. Loss of function in OsAPX2 affected the growth and development of rice seedlings, resulting in semi-dwarf seedlings, yellow-green leaves, leaf lesion mimic and seed sterility. OsAPX2 expression was developmental- and spatial-regulated, and was induced by drought, salt, and cold stresses. Osapx2 mutants had lower APX activity and were sensitive to abiotic stresses; overexpression of OsAPX2 increased APX activity and enhanced stress tolerance. H2O2 and MDA levels were high in Osapx2 mutants but low in OsAPX2-OX transgenic lines relative to wild-type plants after stress treatments. Taken together, the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX2 plays an important role in rice growth and development by protecting the seedlings from abiotic stresses through scavenging reactive oxygen species.
23555916	Identification of SNPs in closely related Temperate Japonica rice cultivars using restriction enzyme-phased sequencing.	2013	PLoS One	Very low polymorphism in the germplasm typically used by breeding programs poses a significant bottleneck with regards to molecular breeding and the exploitation of breeding materials for quantitative trait analyses. California rice cultivars, derived from a very small base of temperate japonica germplasm and having a relatively brief breeding history, are a good example. In this study, we employed a reduced representation sequencing approach called Restriction Enzyme Site Comparative Analysis (RESCAN) to simultaneously identify and genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in forty-five rice cultivars representing the majority of the 100 year-old breeding history in California. Over 20,000 putative SNPs were detected relative to the Nipponbare reference genome which enabled the identification and analysis of inheritance of pedigree haplotypes. Haplotype blocks distinguishing modern California cultivars from each other and from the ancestral short grain temperate japonica cultivars were easily identified. Reduced representation sequencing methods such as RESCAN are a valuable alternative to SNP chip genotyping and low coverage whole genome sequencing.
23334469	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Planta	The outgrowth of root hairs from the epidermal cell layer is regulated by a strict genetic regulatory system and external growth conditions. Rice plants cultivated in water-logged paddy land are exposed to a soil ecology that differs from the environment surrounding upland plants, such as Arabidopsis and maize. To identify genes that play important roles in root-hair growth, a forward genetics approach was used to screen for short-root-hair mutants. A short-root-hair mutant was identified, and the gene was isolated using map-based cloning and sequencing. The mutant harbored a point mutation at a splicing acceptor site, which led to truncation of OsFH1 (rice formin homology 1). Subsequent analysis of two additional T-DNA mutants verified that OsFH1 is important for root-hair elongation. Further studies revealed that the action of OsFH1 on root-hair growth is dependent on growth conditions. The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air. However, root-hair phenotypes of mutants were not influenced by the external supply of hormones or carbohydrates, a deficiency of nutrients, such as Fe or P i , or aeration. This study shows that OsFH1 plays a significant role in root-hair elongation in a growth condition-dependent manner.
23357881	Structural basis of a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase required for stem elongation in rice.	2013	PLoS Genet	Histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me), which can be in a mono-, di-, or trimethylated state, has been shown to play an important role in gene expression involved in plant developmental control and stress adaptation. However, the resetting mechanism of this epigenetic modification is not yet fully understood. In this work, we identified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of H3K4me in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of the gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. Analysis of crystal structure of the catalytic core domain (c-JMJ703) of the protein revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703. Key residues that interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxalylglycine and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide were identified and were shown to be essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. Several key residues are specifically conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation.
23334472	Enhanced production of carboxymethylcellulase of a marine microorganism, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis A-53 in a pilot-scaled bioreactor by a recombinant Escherichia coli JM109/A-53 from rice bran.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	A gene encoding the carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) of a marine bacterium, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis A-53, was cloned in Escherichia coli JMB109 and the recombinant strain was named as E. coli JMB109/A-53. The optimal conditions of rice bran, ammonium chloride, and initial pH of the medium for cell growth, extracted by Design Expert Software based on response surface methodology, were 100.0 g/l, 7.5 g/l, and 7.0, respectively, whereas those for production of CMCase were 100.0 g/l, 7.5 g/l, and 8.0. The optimal temperatures for cell growth and the production of CMCase by E. coli JM109/A-53 were found to be and 40 and 35 °C, respectively. The optimal agitation speed and aeration rate of a 7 l bioreactor for cell growth were 400 rpm and 1.5 vvm, whereas those for production of CMCase were 400 rpm and 0.5 vvm. The optimal inner pressure for cell growth was 0.06 MPa, which was the same as that for production of CMCase. The production of CMCase by E. coli JM109/A-53 under optimized conditions was 880.2 U/ml, which was 2.9 times higher than that before optimization. In this study, rice bran and ammonium chloride were developed as carbon and nitrogen source for production of CMCase by a recombinant E. coli JM109/A-53 and the productivity of E. coli JM109/A-53 was 5.9 times higher than that of B. subtilis subp. subtilis A-53.
23359423	Stress-mediated alterations in chromatin architecture correlate with down-regulation of a gene encoding 60S rpL32 in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Several ribosomal proteins are down-regulated at the translational, post-transcriptional and transcriptional level in response to abiotic stress, resulting in retardation of growth and productivity in various plants. However, transcriptional mechanisms associated with the stress-mediated down-regulation of such genes have not been well studied. Recently, we reported salt-responsive transcriptional down-regulation of a gene encoding 60S ribosomal protein L32, rpL32_8.1, in rice. In the present work, chromatin remodeling mechanisms associated with down-regulation of this gene under salt stress have been studied. The data obtained from the sodium bisulfite sequencing of a genomic region containing portions of the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of rpL32_8.1 exclude a role for DNA methylation in this down-regulation event. Fine mapping of the first nucleosome after the transcription start site (TSS) revealed its occupancy over the TSS to a greater extent under salt stress than that observed in a controlled environment, possibly causing a hindrance to transcription initiation during its down-regulation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, it was observed that histone modifications that are generally associated with highly active genes were markedly reduced under stress conditions at the 5' end region of this gene under salt stress. By applying a modified chromatin conformation capture (mCCC) technique, promoter-terminator interaction was detected for this gene under control conditions. The efficiency of this interaction was diminished under salt stress. This work indicates that the stress-responsive transcriptional down-regulation of rpL32_8.1 is accompanied by alterations in nucleosome positioning, histone modification and gene looping, but not DNA methylation.
23404671	Spatial and temporal progress of programmed cell death in the developing starchy endosperm of rice.	2013	Planta	Programmed cell death (PCD) is the genetically regulated disassembly of cells, and occurs in the endosperm of cereals during seed maturation. Since PCD determines the lifetime of cells, it can affect endosperm growth and, therefore, cereal yield. However, the features and mechanisms of PCD in the developing starchy endosperm in the Poaceae remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of PCD in developing starchy endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by fluorescence microscopy, focusing on the spatial and temporal progress of PCD-associated responses. Cell death commenced in the central region of starchy endosperm, and then spread to the peripheral region. PCD-associated responses, such as mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and activation of the protease that cleaves the amino acid sequence VEID, showed similar spatial patterns to that of cell death, but preceded cell death. Degradation of nuclear DNA could not be detected in developing starchy endosperm by the TUNEL assay. These results indicated that PCD in developing starchy endosperm of rice proceeds via a highly organized pattern. In addition, these results suggested that PCD in developing starchy endosperm of rice is characterized by the involvement of mitochondrial signaling and the activity of a caspase-like protease that cleaves the VEID sequence.
23434658	Expression of a functional recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor from transgenic rice seeds.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) is an important member of the FGF gene family. It is widely used in clinical applications for scald and wound healing in order to stimulate cell proliferation. Further it is applied for inhibiting stem cell differentiation in cultures. Due to a shortage of plasma and low expression levels of recombinant rbFGF in conventional gene expression systems, we explored the production of recombinant rbFGF in rice grains (Oryza sativa bFGF, OsrbFGF). An expression level of up to 185.66 mg/kg in brown rice was obtained. A simple purification protocol was established with final recovery of 4.49% and resulting in a yield of OsrbFGF reaching up to 8.33 mg/kg OsrbFGF. The functional assay of OsrbFGF indicated that the stimulating cell proliferation activity on NIH/3T3 was the same as with commercialized rbFGF. Wound healing in vivo of OsrbFGF is equivalent to commercialized rbFGF. Our results indicate that rice endosperm is capable of expressing small molecular mass proteins, such as bFGF. This again demonstrates that rice endosperm is a promising system to express various biopharmaceutical proteins.
23381954	Isolation of a novel UVB-tolerant rice mutant obtained by exposure to carbon-ion beams.	2013	J Radiat Res	UVB radiation suppresses photosynthesis and protein biosynthesis in plants, which in turn decreases growth and productivity. Here, an ultraviolet-B (UVB)-tolerant rice mutant, utr319 (UV Tolerant Rice 319), was isolated from a mutagenized population derived from 2500 M1 seeds (of the UVB-resistant cultivar 'Sasanishiki') that were exposed to carbon ions. The utr319 mutant was more tolerant to UVB than the wild type. Neither the levels of UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimers [(6-4) photoproducts], nor the repair of CPDs or (6-4) photoproducts, was altered in the utr319 mutant. Thus, the utr319 mutant may be impaired in the production of a previously unidentified factor that confers UVB tolerance. To identify the mutated region in the utr319 mutant, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed. Two adjacent genes on chromosome 7, Os07g0264900 and Os07g0265100, were predicted to represent the mutant allele. Sequence analysis of the chromosome region in utr319 revealed a deletion of 45 419 bp. RNAi analysis indicated that Os07g0265100 is most likely the mutated gene. Database analysis indicated that the Os07g0265100 gene, UTR319, encodes a putative protein with unknown characteristics or function. In addition, the homologs of UTR319 are conserved only among land plants. Therefore, utr319 is a novel UVB-tolerant rice mutant and UTR319 may be crucial for the determination of UVB sensitivity in rice, although the function of UTR319 has not yet been determined.
23394789	Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Heat is a primary abiotic stress that reduces crop yields. At the seedling stage, we identified heat-sensitive mutants that carried T-DNA inserted into a heat shock protein 70 gene, OsHsp70CP1. When grown under a constant high temperature (40°C), the seedling leaves developed severe chlorosis whereas plants grown at a constant 27°C showed a normal phenotype. This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures. Transient expression analyses revealed that OsHsp70CP1 was localized to the stroma. OsHsp70CP1 was dominantly expressed in photosynthetic tissues; transcripts were greatly increased by heat stress. Some transcripts for plastid RNA metabolism were impaired in the mutant while others were not, demonstrating that a subset of nuclear-encoded proteins are substrates of OsHsp70CP1.
23399101	Evolution of variety-specific regulatory schema for expression of osa-miR408 in indica rice varieties under drought stress.	2013	FEBS J	Evolution of differential regulatory mechanisms can lead to quite distinct physiological attributes. In the present study, we have identified one such regulatory schema that regulates osa-miR408 and responds differentially in drought-sensitive and -tolerant indica rice varieties. A comparison of the drought stress response in drought-sensitive (Pusa Basmati 1 and IR64) and drought-tolerant (Nagina 22 and Vandana) indica rice varieties revealed that, during drought stress, levels of miR408 transcript decrease significantly in sensitive cultivars, whereas they remain elevated in the tolerant cultivars. The trend is reflected in young seedlings, as well as in flag leaf and spikelets of adult plants (heading stage). Members of the plastocyanin-like protein family targeted by miR408 also show the inverse expression profile and thus accumulate at a lower level in tolerant cultivars during drought. Interestingly, some members of this family are implicated in maintaining the cellular redox state and spikelet fertility in Arabidopsis. An investigation of miR408 loci (including promoter) in all four cultivars did not reveal any significant sequence variation indicating an involvement of the upstream regulatory schema. Indeed, a similar variety-specific stress response was found in the Oryza sativa squamosa promoter-binding-like 9 transcription factor that regulates miR408 expression. We further demonstrate that drought-mediated induction of miR408 in Nagina 22 is regulated by [Ca(2+)]cyt levels. However, [Ca(2+)]cyt does not appear to regulate miR408 levels in Pusa Basmati 1, suggesting a variety-specific evolution of regulatory schema in rice.
23553598	Identification of tissue-preferential expression patterns of rice miRNAs.	2013	J Cell Biochem	It is imperative to understand the mechanisms of growth and development in higher plants for improving plant adaptation during different developmental stages. Plant microRNAs (miRs) play crucial regulatory roles in various developmental processes. As many as 15 miR families having multiple members are known to regulate plant development, yet the spatio-temporal expression patterns of individual members are not fully characterized. It is likely that different members of miR families can make specific contributions to the spatio-temporal control of targets. To understand the functional complexity of miRs and the amount of degeneracy existing in miR-mediated regulation of differentiated but developing tissues, we have identified the Osa-miR-sequences that are expressed in specific tissues. We adopted the approach of comparative miR profiling using next-generation sequencing technology followed by experimental validation. It was observed that 59 Osa-miR-sequences show tissue-preferential expression in local basmati rice variety; while 126 miRs belonging to 81 families are differentially regulated in these tissues. The 21 nt miRs were predominant in all tissues, but the 24 nt miRs were the most abundantly expressed. This indicates that target cleavage and chromatin state regulation are involved in organ development. This study also identified the expression patterns of individual members of Osa-miR families that were common and divergent between the indica and japonica rice varieties. The expression patterns of the predicted targets were also analyzed. The possible implications of the miR distribution patterns with respect to the regulation of their respective targets are discussed.
23501875	LATERAL ROOTLESS2, a cyclophilin protein, regulates lateral root initiation and auxin signaling pathway in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	
23471133	Paraquat Resistant1, a Golgi-localized putative transporter protein, is involved in intracellular transport of paraquat.	2013	Plant Physiol	Paraquat is one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide. In green plants, paraquat targets the chloroplast by transferring electrons from photosystem I to molecular oxygen to generate toxic reactive oxygen species, which efficiently induce membrane damage and cell death. A number of paraquat-resistant biotypes of weeds and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants have been identified. The herbicide resistance in Arabidopsis is partly attributed to a reduced uptake of paraquat through plasma membrane-localized transporters. However, the biochemical mechanism of paraquat resistance remains poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an Arabidopsis paraquat resistant1 (par1) mutant that shows strong resistance to the herbicide without detectable developmental abnormalities. PAR1 encodes a putative l-type amino acid transporter protein localized to the Golgi apparatus. Compared with the wild-type plants, the par1 mutant plants show similar efficiency of paraquat uptake, suggesting that PAR1 is not directly responsible for the intercellular uptake of paraquat. However, the par1 mutation caused a reduction in the accumulation of paraquat in the chloroplast, suggesting that PAR1 is involved in the intracellular transport of paraquat into the chloroplast. We identified a PAR1-like gene, OsPAR1, in rice (Oryza sativa). Whereas the overexpression of OsPAR1 resulted in hypersensitivity to paraquat, the knockdown of its expression using RNA interference conferred paraquat resistance on the transgenic rice plants. These findings reveal a unique mechanism by which paraquat is actively transported into the chloroplast and also provide a practical approach for genetic manipulations of paraquat resistance in crops.
23604075	Quantitative trait locus and haplotype analyses of wild and crop-mimic traits in U.S. weedy rice.	2013	G3 (Bethesda)	Conspecific weeds retained characteristics from wild ancestors and also developed crop mimicries for adaptation and competitiveness. This research was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the wild and crop-mimic traits and to determine haplotype variants for QTL-rich regions in U.S. weedy rice. An F2 population from the cross between a cultivated (EM93-1) and a U.S. weedy (US1) rice line was evaluated for six wild and eight crop-mimic traits in a greenhouse to identify the QTL. A core collection of 27 U.S. weedy red rice lines and 14 AA-genome wild rice lines were determined for the haplotype variants. A total of 49 QTL were identified, with 45 collocated as clusters on 14 genomic segments. The number of haplotypes across the 14 segments was lower in the weedy (6.1 ± 2.4) than in the wild (7.5 ± 1.8) rice sample. Both samples shared ~50% haplotypes (wild-like). The EM93-1-like haplotypes accounted for a greater proportion (30 ± 26%) of the haplotypes in the weedy than in the wild (7 ± 10%) rice. Based on haplotype patterns for the 14 QTL cluster regions, 26 of the 28 red rice lines were clustered into two groups corresponding to the black-hull awned and straw-hull awnless morphological types, respectively. The QTL analysis demonstrated that conspecific weed-crop differentiation involved many genomic segments with multiple loci regulating natural variation for adaptation and competitiveness. The haplotype analysis revealed that U.S. weedy rice retained large blocks of linkage disequilibrium for the multiple loci from the wild relatives and also incorporated haplotypes from cultivars.
23563552	Isolation of campesteryl ferulate and epi-campesteryl ferulate, two components of γ-oryzanol from rice bran.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Campesteryl ferulate (3a, 24R/α) and epi-campesteryl ferulate (3b, 24S/β), components of rice bran γ-oryzanol, were isolated by the preparative recycle HPLC system using a combination of ODS silica and cholester packed columns at over 99% purity. Their purities and structures of 3a and 3b thus obtained were confirmed by HPLC analysis and physical data (1H- and 13C-NMR, MS spectra, and X-ray crystallography).
23624393	Locating QTLs controlling several adult root traits in an elite Chinese hybrid rice.	2013	Gene	This study aimed to elucidate the genetics of the adult root system in elite Chinese hybrid rice. Several adult root traits in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of Xieyou 9308 and two backcross F1 (BCF1) populations derived from the RILs were phenotyped under hydroponic culture at heading stage for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and other statistical analysis. There a total of eight QTLs detected for the root traits. Among of them, a pleiotropic QTL was repeatedly flanked by RM180 and RM5436 on the short arm of chromosome 7 for multiple traits across RILs and its BCF1 populations, accounting for 6.88% to 25.26% of the phenotypic variances. Only additive/dominant QTLs were detected for the root traits. These results can serve as a foundation for facilitating future cloning and molecular breeding.
23570690	Gene expression profiles in rice gametes and zygotes: identification of gamete-enriched genes and up- or down-regulated genes in zygotes after fertilization.	2013	J Exp Bot	In angiosperms, fertilization and subsequent zygotic development occur in embryo sacs deeply embedded in the ovaries; therefore, these processes are poorly elucidated. In this study, microarray-based transcriptome analyses were conducted on rice sperm cells, egg cells, and zygotes isolated from flowers to identify candidate genes involved in gametic and/or early zygotic development. Cell type-specific transcriptomes were obtained, and up- or down-regulated genes in zygotes after fertilization were identified, in addition to genes enriched in male and female gametes. A total of 325 putatively up-regulated and 94 putatively down-regulated genes in zygotes were obtained. Interestingly, several genes encoding homeobox proteins or transcription factors were identified as highly up-regulated genes after fertilization, and the gene ontology for up-regulated genes was highly enriched in functions related to chromatin/DNA organization and assembly. Because a gene encoding methyltransferase 1 was identified as a highly up-regulated gene in zygotes after fertilization, the effect of an inhibitor of this enzyme on zygote development was monitored. The inhibitor appeared partially to affect polarity or division asymmetry in rice zygotes, but it did not block normal embryo generation.
23563550	Suppression of rice immunity by Xanthomonas oryzae type III effector Xoo2875.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Xanthomonas oryzae delivers effector proteins into host cells through a type III secretion system to inhibit host immune responses, but how these effectors suppress host immunity is largely unknown. Here we found that Xoo2875, one of the effectors of X. oryzae, strongly inhibited host resistance to X. oryzae. Transgenic rice plants expressing Xoo2875 exhibited semi-dwarfism and a reduction in Brassinolide-dependent laminar inclination, characteristics of brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutants caused by mutations of the BR receptor. A yeast two-hybrid experiment indicated that Xoo2875 interacted with OsBAK1, an essential component of both microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and BR receptors, suggesting that the virulent activity of Xoo2875 is mediated by inhibition of OsBAK1. Expression of Xoo2875 in Arabidopsis cells activated host immune responses, suggesting the presence of intracellular immune receptors that recognize Xoo2875. Because Xoo2875 homologs are highly conserved in Xanthomonas species, the development of Xoo2875-induced immunity is probably a useful strategy to avoid pathogen invasion.
23137285	A Kelch motif-containing serine/threonine protein phosphatase determines the large grain QTL trait in rice.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	A thorough understanding of the genetic basis of rice grain traits is critical for the improvement of rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties. In this study, we generated an F₂ population by crossing the large-grain japonica cultivar CW23 with Peiai 64 (PA64), an elite indica small-grain cultivar. Using QTL analysis, 17 QTLs for five grain traits were detected on four different chromosomes. Eight of the QTLs were newly-identified in this study. In particular, qGL3-1, a newly-identified grain length QTL with the highest LOD value and largest phenotypic variation, was fine-mapped to the 17 kb region of chromosome 3. A serine/threonine protein phosphatase gene encoding a repeat domain containing two Kelch motifs was identified as the unique candidate gene corresponding to this QTL. A comparison of PA64 and CW23 sequences revealed a single nucleotide substitution (C→A) at position 1092 in exon 10, resulting in replacement of Asp (D) in PA64 with Glu (E) in CW23 for the 364(th) amino acid. This variation is located at the D position of the conserved sequence motif AVLDT of the Kelch repeat. Genetic analysis of a near-isogenic line (NIL) for qGL3-1 revealed that the allele qGL3-1 from CW23 has an additive or partly dominant effect, and is suitable for use in molecular marker-assisted selection.
23352405	Iron excess affects rice photosynthesis through stomatal and non-stomatal limitations.	2013	Plant Sci	Iron toxicity is the most important stressor of rice in many lowland environments worldwide. Rice cultivars differ widely in their ability to tolerate excess iron. A physiological evaluation of iron toxicity in rice was performed using non-invasive photosynthesis, photorespiration and chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging measurements and chlorophyll content determination by SPAD. Four rice cultivars (BR IRGA 409; BR IRGA 412; BRA 041171 and BRA 041152) from the Brazilian breeding programs were used. Fe(2+) was supplied in the nutrient solution as Fe-EDTA (0.019, 4, 7 and 9 mM). Increases in shoot iron content due to Fe(2+) treatments led to changes in most of the non-invasive physiological variables assessed. The reduction in rice photosynthesis can be attributed to stomatal limitations at moderate Fe(2+) doses (4mM) and both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations at higher doses. Photorespiration was an important sink for electrons in rice cultivars under iron excess. A decreased chlorophyll content and limited photochemical ability to cope with light excess were characteristic of the more sensitive and iron accumulator cultivars (BRA 041171 and BRA 041152). Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging revealed a spatial heterogeneity of photosynthesis under excessive iron concentrations. The results showed the usefulness of non-invasive physiological measurements to assess differences among cultivars. The contributions toward understanding the rice photosynthetic response to toxic levels of iron in the nutrient solution are also discussed.
23231646	Conserved metabolic steps for sporopollenin precursor formation in tobacco and rice.	2013	Physiol Plant	The development of pollen wall with proper sporopollenin deposition is essential for pollen viability and male fertility in flowering plants. Sporopollenin is a complex biopolymer synthesized from fatty acid and phenolic derivatives. Recent investigations in Arabidopsis have identified a number of anther-specific genes involved in the production of fatty-acyl monomers potentially required for exine formation. The existence of ancient biochemical pathways for sporopollenin biosynthesis has been widely proposed but experimental evidence from plant species other than Arabidopsis is not extensively available. Here, we investigated the metabolic steps catalyzed by the anther-specific acyl-CoA synthetase (ACOS), polyketide synthase (PKS) and tetraketide α-pyrone reductase (TKPR). Using fatty acids as starting substrates, sequential activities of heterologously expressed tobacco enzymes NtACOS1, NtPKS1 and NtTKPR1 resulted in the production of reduced tetraketide α-pyrones. Transgenic RNA interference lines were then generated for the different tobacco genes which were demonstrated to be indispensable for normal pollen development and male fertility. Similarly, recombinant rice OsPKS1 and OsTKPR1 were shown to function as downstream enzymes of NtACOS1. In addition, insertion mutant lines for these rice genes displayed different levels of impaired pollen and seed formation. Taken together, reduced tetraketide α-pyrones appear to represent common sporopollenin fatty-acyl precursors essential for male fertility in taxonomically distinct plant species.
23352410	Identification of heat-sensitive QTL derived from common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2013	Plant Sci	Understanding the responses of rice plants to heat-stress is a challenging, yet crucial, endeavor. A set of introgression lines was previously developed using an advanced backcrossing strategy that involved the elite indica cultivar Teqing as the recipient and an accession of common wild rice (Oryza rufipongon Griff.) as the donor. In this study, we evaluated the responses of 90 of these previously developed introgression lines to heat stress. Five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to heat response were detected. The phenotypic variances explained by these QTLs ranged from 6.83% to 14.63%, and O. rufipogon-derived alleles at one locus reduced sensitivity to heat. A heat-sensitive introgression line, YIL106, was identified and characterized. Genotypic analysis demonstrated that YIL106 contained four introgressed segments derived from O. rufipongon and two QTLs (qHTS1-1 and qHTS3) related to heat response. Physiological tests, including measurements of chlorophyll content, electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde content, and soluble sugar content, were consistent with the heat sensitivity observed in YIL106. Ultrastructural analysis of YIL106 mesophyll cells showed that they were severely damaged following heat stress. This suggests that modification of the cell membrane system is a primary response to heat stress in plants. Identification and characterization of the heat-sensitive line YIL106 may facilitate the isolation of genes associated with the response of rice plants to heat stress.
23216197	Comparative proteomic analysis of rice seedlings in response to inoculation with Bacillus cereus.	2013	Lett Appl Microbiol	UNLABELLED: Reports suggest that Bacillus spp. can be used to increase plant growth and resistance to disease, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Bacillus spp. and plant is not completely understood. In the present study, to clarify these underlying mechanisms, the interaction between Bacillus cereus and rice was investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Through comparative analysis, a total of 31 differentially expressed proteins were obtained upon B. cereus NMSL88 treatment, including 22 proteins that were up-regulated and nine that were down-regulated. These data indicated that certain proteins involved in plant growth and development were up-regulated, such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase. Interestingly, proteins involved in defence were also up-regulated, including peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases and kinases. Thus, proteins associated with disease resistance characteristics were induced in the plants after exposure to B. cereus NMSL88. In addition, several proteins involved in protein and lipid metabolism showed significant changes in expression.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study is the first report to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in rice seedlings in response to inoculation with Bacillus cereus at the level of proteome. The results demonstrated that B. cereus NMSL88 can up-regulate the expression of proteins related to plant growth and defence, and lead to enhanced plant growth and disease resistance.
23544067	The HD-GYP domain protein RpfG of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola regulates synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides that contribute to biofilm formation and virulence on rice.	2013	PLoS One	Bacterial leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is one of the most important diseases in rice. However, little is known about the pathogenicity mechanisms of Xoc. Here we have investigated the function of three HD-GYP domain regulatory proteins in biofilm formation, the synthesis of virulence factors and virulence of Xoc. Deletion of rpfG resulted in altered production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), abolished virulence on rice and enhanced biofilm formation, but had little effect on the secretion of proteases and motility. In contrast, mutational analysis showed that the other two HD-GYP domain proteins had no effect on virulence factor synthesis and tested phenotypes. Mutation of rpfG led to up-regulation of the type III secretion system and altered expression of three putative glycosyltransferase genes gumD, pgaC and xagB, which are part of operons directing the synthesis of different extracellular polysaccharides. The pgaABCD and xagABCD operons were greatly up-regulated in the Xoc ΔrpfG mutant, whereas the expression of the gum genes was unaltered or slightly enhanced. The elevated biofilm formation of the Xoc ΔrpfG mutant was dramatically reduced upon deletion of gumD, xagA and xagB, but not when pgaA and pgaC were deleted. Interestingly, only the ΔgumD mutant, among these single gene mutants, exhibits multiple phenotype alterations including reduced biofilm and EPS production and attenuated virulence on rice. These data indicate that RpfG is a global regulator that controls biofilm formation, EPS production and bacterial virulence in Xoc and that both gumD- and xagB-dependent EPS contribute to biofilm formation under different conditions.
23322175	Transcriptomic analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm using the RNA-Seq technique.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	The endosperm plays an important role in seed formation and germination, especially in rice (Oryza sativa). We used a high-throughput sequencing technique (RNA-Seq) to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in rice endosperm development. Three cDNA libraries were taken from rice endosperm at 3, 6 and 10 days after pollination (DAP), which resulted in the detection of 21,596, 20,910 and 19,459 expressed gens, respectively. By ERANGE, we identified 10,371 differentially expressed genes (log(2)Ratio ≥1, FDR ≤0.001). The results were compared against three public databases (Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and MapMan) in order to annotate the gene descriptions, associate them with gene ontology terms and to assign each to pathways. A large number of genes related to ribosomes, the spliceosome and oxidative phosphorylation were found to be expressed in the early and middle stages. Plant hormone, galactose metabolism and carbon fixation related genes showed a significant increase in expression at the middle stage, whereas genes for defense against disease or response to stress as well as genes for starch/sucrose metabolism were strongly expressed during the later stages of endosperm development. Interestingly, most metabolic pathways were down-regulated between 3 and 10 DAP except for those involved in the accumulation of material, such as starch/sucrose and protein metabolism. We also identified the expression of 1,118 putative transcription factor genes in endosperm development. The RNA-Seq results provide further systematic understanding of rice endosperm development at a fine scale and a foundation for future studies.
23384860	Functional analysis of Pid3-A4, an ortholog of rice blast resistance gene Pid3 revealed by allele mining in common wild rice.	2013	Phytopathology	The rice blast resistance gene Pid3 encodes a nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) protein. This gene was cloned from the rice 'Digu' (indica) by performing a genome-wide comparison of the NBS-LRR gene family between two genome-sequenced varieties, '9311' (indica) and 'Nipponbare' (japonica). In this study, we performed functional analysis of Pid3-A4, an ortholog of Pid3 revealed by allele mining in the common wild rice A4 (Oryza rufipogon). The predicted protein encoded by Pid3-A4 shares 99.03% sequence identity with Pid3, with only nine amino-acid substitutions. In wild rice plants, Pid3-A4 is constitutively expressed, and its expression is not induced by Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Zhong-10-8-14 infection. Importantly, in transgenic plants, Pid3-A4, as compared with Pid3, displays a distinct resistance spectrum to a set of M. oryzae isolates, including those that prevail in the rice fields of Sichuan Province. Therefore, Pid3-A4 should be quite useful for the breeding of rice blast resistance, especially in southwestern China.
23459234	Insight into differential responses of upland and paddy rice to drought stress by comparative expression profiling analysis.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	In this study, the drought responses of two genotypes, IRAT109 and Zhenshan 97 (ZS97), representing upland and paddy rice, respectively, were systematically compared at the morphological, physiological and transcriptional levels. IRAT109 has better performance in traits related to drought avoidance, such as leaf rolling, root volumes, the ratio of leaf water loss and relative conductivity. At the transcriptional level, more genes were induced by drought in IRAT109 at the early drought stage, but more genes had dynamic expression patterns in ZS97 at different drought degrees. Under drought conditions, more genes related to reproductive development and establishment of localization were repressed in IRAT109, but more genes involved in degradation of cellular components were induced in ZS97. By checking the expression patterns of 36 drought-responsive genes (located in 14 quantitative trail loci [QTL] intervals) in ZS97, IRAT109 and near isogenic lines (NILs) of the QTL intervals, we found that more than half of these genes had their expression patterns or expression levels changed in the NILs when compared to that in ZS97 or IRAT109. Our results may provide valuable information for dissecting the genetic bases of traits related to drought resistance, as well as for narrowing the candidate genes for the traits.

23502780	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	2013	Nat Genet	Plant cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) results from incompatibilities between the organellar and nuclear genomes and prevents self pollination, enabling hybrid crop breeding to increase yields. The Wild Abortive CMS (CMS-WA) has been exploited in the majority of 'three-line' hybrid rice production since the 1970s, but the molecular basis of this trait remains unknown. Here we report that a new mitochondrial gene, WA352, which originated recently in wild rice, confers CMS-WA because the protein it encodes interacts with the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11. In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion. WA352-induced sterility can be suppressed by two restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms to counteract deleterious cytoplasmic factors. Thus, CMS-related cytoplasmic-nuclear incompatibility is driven by a detrimental interaction between a newly evolved mitochondrial gene and a conserved, essential nuclear gene.
23523466	Alleviation of chromium toxicity in rice seedlings by applying exogenous glutathione.	2013	J Plant Physiol	The effect of exogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) on alleviation of hexavalent chromium (Cr(6+)) toxicity to rice seedlings and its physiological mechanisms were comprehensively investigated in a series of experiments. Our results showed that growth and nutrient uptake of rice seedlings were dramatically reduced under 100 μM Cr(6+) stress, and the reduction was significantly alleviated by exogenous GSH. Cr(6+) stress also reduced cell viability in root tips and damaged ultrastructure of both chloroplasts and root cells, while the addition of GSH alleviates those negative effects. Cr-induced toxicity and GSH-caused Cr alleviation differed significantly between Cr-tolerant Line 117 (L117) and Cr-sensitive Line 41 (L41). Under Cr(6+) stress, cystine content was increased and GSH content was decreased in rice plants, exogenous GSH, however, mitigated the Cr-toxicity by reversing the Cr-induced changes of the two compounds. The types of Cr-induced secretion of organic acids varied between the genotypes, where reduction in the contents of acetic and lactic acids and tartaric and malic acids were observed in L117 and L41, respectively. The addition of GSH alleviated the reduction of secretion of these organic acids. Exogenous GSH also altered the forms of Cr ions in the rhizosphere and the fraction of distribution at subcellular level in both shoots and roots. It may be concluded that the alleviation of Cr(6+) toxicity by exogenous GSH is directly attributed to its regulation on forms of Cr ions in rhizosphere and their distribution at subcellular levels.
23499935	The pentose catabolic pathway of the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae involves a novel pentose reductase restricted to few fungal species.	2013	FEBS Lett	A gene (MoPRD1), related to xylose reductases, was identified in Magnaporthe oryzae. Recombinant MoPRD1 displays its highest specific reductase activity toward L-arabinose and D-xylose. Km and Vmax values using L-arabinose and D-xylose are similar. MoPRD1 was highly overexpressed 2-8h after transfer of mycelium to D-xylose or L-arabinose, compared to D-glucose. Therefore, we conclude that MoPDR1 is a novel pentose reductase, which combines the activities and expression patterns of fungal L-arabinose and D-xylose reductases. Phylogenetic analysis shows that PRD1 defines a novel family of pentose reductases related to fungal D-xylose reductases, but distinct from fungal L-arabinose reductases. The presence of PRD1, L-arabinose and D-xylose reductases encoding genes in a given species is variable and likely related to their life style.

23582455	Functional genomics based understanding of rice endosperm development.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Seed development, especially the relevant regulatory mechanism and genetic network are of fundamental scientific interest. Seed development consists of the development of embryo and endosperm; and endosperm development of rice (model species of monocots) is closely related to grain yield and quality. Recent genetic studies, together with other approaches, including transcriptome and proteomics analysis, high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq), revealed the crucial roles of genetic and epigenetic controls in rice endosperm development. Here we summarize and update the genetic networks involved in the regulation of endosperm initiation, cell cycle regulation, aleurone layer specification, starch synthesis, storage protein accumulation and endosperm size, and the interactions between embryo and endosperm.
23050791	Suppression of Ku70/80 or Lig4 leads to decreased stable transformation and enhanced homologous recombination in rice.	2012	New Phytol	Evidence for the involvement of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway in Agrobacterium-mediated transferred DNA (T-DNA) integration into the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis remains inconclusive. Having established a rapid and highly efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system in rice (Oryza sativa) using scutellum-derived calli, we examined here the involvement of the NHEJ pathway in Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation in rice. Rice calli from OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 knockdown (KD) plants were infected with Agrobacterium harboring a sensitive emerald luciferase (LUC) reporter construct to evaluate stable expression and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct to monitor transient expression of T-DNA. Transient expression was not suppressed, but stable expression was reduced significantly, in KD plants. Furthermore, KD-Ku70 and KD-Lig4 calli exhibited an increase in the frequency of homologous recombination (HR) compared with control calli. In addition, suppression of OsKu70, OsKu80 and OsLig4 induced the expression of HR-related genes on treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Our findings suggest strongly that NHEJ is involved in Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation in rice, and that there is a competitive and complementary relationship between the NHEJ and HR pathways for DNA double-strand break repair in rice.
22921006	Overexpression of OsTLP27 in rice improves chloroplast function and photochemical efficiency.	2012	Plant Sci	The thylakoid lumen proteins are highly associated with photosynthesis functionally. In this study, we characterized the OsTLP27 gene from rice (Oryza sativa), which encodes a 27-kDa of 257-amino acid with 53% homology to the AtTLP gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. OsTLP27 was predicted to encode a thylakoid lumen protein of unknown function in chloroplast, and chloroplast targeting of OsTLP27 was confirmed by transient expression of a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP). OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm. Constitutive expression of OsTLP27 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter resulted in increased pigment content and enhanced photochemical efficiency in terms of the values of maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (F(v)/F(m)), effective quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII), electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching (qP). Overexpression of OsTLP27 also enhanced transcript levels of genes related to chloroplast function and caused changes in the grana size and number. Further study showed that the structure and polypeptide composition of the photosynthetic apparatus were altered in transgenic lines overexpressing OsTLP27. These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice.
23027867	Alterations of mitochondrial protein assembly and jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway in Honglian (HL)-type cytoplasmic male sterility rice.	2012	J Biol Chem	It has been suggested that the mitochondrial chimeric gene orfH79 is the cause for abortion of microspores in Honglian cytoplasmic male sterile rice, yet little is known regarding its mechanism of action. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics strategy to compare the mitochondrial proteome between the sterile line Yuetai A and its fertile near-isogenic line Yuetai B. We discovered a reduced quantity of specific proteins in mitochondrial complexes in Yuetai A compared with Yuetai B, indicating a defect in mitochondrial complex assembly in the sterile line. Western blotting showed that ORFH79 protein and ATP1 protein, an F(1) sector component of complex V, are both associated with large protein complexes of similar size. Respiratory complex activity assays and transmission electron microscopy revealed functional and morphological defects in the mitochondria of Yuetai A when compared with Yuetai B. In addition, we identified one sex determination TASSELSEED2-like protein increased in Yuetai A, leading to the discovery of an aberrant variation of the jasmonic acid pathway during the development of microspores.
23073011	Genome wide analysis of Cyclophilin gene family from rice and Arabidopsis and its comparison with yeast.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Cyclophilin proteins are the members of immunophillin group of proteins, known for their property of binding to the immune-suppressant drug cyclosporin A, hence named as cyclophilins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerisation process of proline residues. In the present study, an in-silico based approach was followed to identify and characterize the cyclophilin family from rice, Arabidopsis and yeast. We were able to identify 28 rice, 35 Arabidopsis and 8 yeast cyclophilin genes from their respective genomes on the basis of their annotation as well as the presence of highly conserved PPIase domain. The evolutionary relationship of the cyclophilin genes from the three genomes was analyzed using the phylogenetic tree. We have also classified the rice cyclophilin genes on the basis of localization of the protein in cell. The structural similarity of the cyclophilins was also analyzed on the basis of their homology model. The expression analysis performed using Genevestigator revealed a very strong stress responsive behavior of the gene family which was more prominent in later stages of stress. The study indicates the importance of the gene family in stress response as well as several developmental stages thus opening up many avenues for future study on the cyclophilin proteins.
23192746	Genome-wide profiling of histone H3K4-tri-methylation and gene expression in rice under drought stress.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Histone modifications affect gene expression level. Several studies have shown that they may play key roles in regulating gene expression in plants under abiotic stress, but genome-wide surveys of such stress-related modifications are very limited, especially for crops. By using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, we investigated the genome-wide distribution pattern of histone H3 lysine4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and the pattern's association with whole genome expression profiles of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under drought stress, one of the major and representative abiotic stresses. We detected 51.1 and 48 % of annotated genes with H3K4me3 modification in rice seedlings under normal growth (control) and drought stress conditions, respectively. By RNA-Seq, 76.7 and 79 % of annotated genes were detected with expression in rice seedlings under the control and drought stress conditions, respectively. Furthermore, 4,837 genes were differentially H3K4me3-modified (H3M), (3,927 genes with increased H3M; 910 genes with decreased H3M) and 5,866 genes were differentially expressed (2,145 up-regulated; 3,721 down-regulated) in drought stress. Differential H3K4me3 methylation only affects a small proportion of stress-responsive genes, and the H3K4me3 modification level was significantly and positively correlated with transcript level only for a subset of genes showing changes both in modification and expression with drought stress. Moreover, for the H3K4me3-regulated stress-related genes, the H3K4me3 modification level was mainly increased in genes with low expression and decreased in genes with high expression under drought stress. The comprehensive data of H3K4me3 and gene expression profiles in rice under drought stress provide a useful resource for future epigenomic regulation studies in plants under abiotic stresses.
23193278	The Rice Genome Knowledgebase (RGKbase): an annotation database for rice comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.	2013	Nucleic Acids Res	Over the past 10 years, genomes of cultivated rice cultivars and their wild counterparts have been sequenced although most efforts are focused on genome assembly and annotation of two major cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) subspecies, 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica). To integrate information from genome assemblies and annotations for better analysis and application, we now introduce a comparative rice genome database, the Rice Genome Knowledgebase (RGKbase, http://rgkbase.big.ac.cn/RGKbase/). RGKbase is built to have three major components: (i) integrated data curation for rice genomics and molecular biology, which includes genome sequence assemblies, transcriptomic and epigenomic data, genetic variations, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the relevant literature; (ii) User-friendly viewers, such as Gbrowse, GeneBrowse and Circos, for genome annotations and evolutionary dynamics and (iii) Bioinformatic tools for compositional and synteny analyses, gene family classifications, gene ontology terms and pathways and gene co-expression networks. RGKbase current includes data from five rice cultivars and species: Nipponbare (japonica), 93-11 (indica), PA64s (indica), the African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and a wild rice species (Oryza brachyantha). We are also constantly introducing new datasets from variety of public efforts, such as two recent releases-sequence data from ∼1000 rice varieties, which are mapped into the reference genome, yielding ample high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions-deletions.
23129510	Molecular cloning and pharmacological characterisation of a tyramine receptor from the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker).	2013	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) are considered to be the invertebrate counterparts of the vertebrate adrenergic transmitters. Because these two phenolamines are the only biogenic amines whose physiological significance is presumably restricted to invertebrates, the attention of pharmacologists has been focused on the corresponding receptors, which are believed to represent promising targets for novel insecticides. For example, the formamidine pesticides, such as chlordimeform and amitraz, have been shown to activate OA receptors.

RESULTS: A full-length cDNA (designated CsTyR1) from the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker), has been obtained through homology cloning in combination with rapid amplification of cDNA ends/polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The mRNA of CsTyR1 is present in various tissues, including hemocytes, fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubules, nerve cord and epidermis, and it is found predominantly in the larval nerve cord with 16-80-fold enrichment compared with other tissues. The authors generated a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing CsTyR1 in order to examine functional and pharmacological properties of this receptor. Both TA and OA at 0.01-100 µM can reduce forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner (TA, EC(50) = 369 nM; OA, EC(50) = 978 nM). In agonist assays, activation of CsTyR1 by clonidine and amitraz but not by naphazoline and chlordimeform can also significantly inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The inhibitory effect of TA at 10 µM is eliminated by coincubation with yohimbine, phentolamine or chlorpromazine (each 10 µM).

CONCLUSION: This study represents a comprehensive molecular and pharmacological characterisation of a tyramine receptor in the rice stem borer.
23154534	One divinyl reductase reduces the 8-vinyl groups in various intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis in a given higher plant species, but the isozyme differs between species.	2013	Plant Physiol	Divinyl reductase (DVR) converts 8-vinyl groups on various chlorophyll intermediates to ethyl groups, which is indispensable for chlorophyll biosynthesis. To date, five DVR activities have been detected, but adequate evidence of enzymatic assays using purified or recombinant DVR proteins has not been demonstrated, and it is unclear whether one or multiple enzymes catalyze these activities. In this study, we systematically carried out enzymatic assays using four recombinant DVR proteins and five divinyl substrates and then investigated the in vivo accumulation of various chlorophyll intermediates in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The results demonstrated that both rice and maize DVR proteins can convert all of the five divinyl substrates to corresponding monovinyl compounds, while both cucumber and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DVR proteins can convert three of them. Meanwhile, the OsDVR (Os03g22780)-inactivated 824ys mutant of rice exclusively accumulated divinyl chlorophylls in its various organs during different developmental stages. Collectively, we conclude that a single DVR with broad substrate specificity is responsible for reducing the 8-vinyl groups of various chlorophyll intermediates in higher plants, but DVR proteins from different species have diverse and differing substrate preferences, although they are homologous.
23136980	Association of specific pectin methylesterases with Al-induced root elongation inhibition in rice.	2013	Physiol Plant	The negative charges of cell wall pectin molecules attributed by pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11) contribute to Al binding capacity. We examined the expression profiles of 35 members of the PME gene family in the root apex of an Al-sensitive rice 'Zhefu802' under Al stress. While root elongation was inhibited by 40% after 3-h exposure to 25 µM Al, cell wall PME activity and the abundance of eight PME genes transcripts were increased. The same Al treatment which had almost no effect on root elongation of an Al-resistant rice ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare' did not change the expression patterns of these eight PME genes. However, when Al concentration was increased to 50 µM, by which the root elongation of 'Nipponbare' was inhibited by 40% too, the expression of these PME genes were also upregulated except two genes with no signal. These suggest a possible correlation between the upregulated genes and Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in rice. Furthermore, these eight PME genes behaved differently when subjected to CdCl2 and LaCl3 treatments, implying the specificity of different PME genes in response to different metal toxicities. The transgenic rice overexpressing one of these eight PME genes OsPME14 showed higher PME activity and Al content in root tip cell wall, and became more sensitive to Al stress, verifying the involvement of the specific PME gene in Al toxicity. Therefore, our results provided the molecular evidence to connect the expression of specific PME genes with the Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in rice.
23129534	Antibacterial activity of two chitosan solutions and their effect on rice bacterial leaf blight and leaf streak.	2013	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Bacterial leaf blight and leaf streak are the two most damaging bacterial diseases of rice. However, few bactericidal chemicals are available for controlling both diseases. The antibacterial properties of two kinds of chitosan with different molecular weights and degrees of N-deacetylation and their effect on rice bacterial leaf blight and leaf streak were evaluated.

RESULTS: Results showed that the two kinds of chitosan solution possess a strong antibacterial activity against both rice bacterial pathogens and significantly reduced disease incidence and severity by comparison with the control under greenhouse conditions. However, the interaction between chitosan and rice pathogens was affected by the type and concentration of chitosan, the bacterial species and the contact time between chitosan and bacteria. The direct antibacterial activity of chitosan may be attributed to both membrane lysis and the destruction of biofilm. In addition, both chitosan solutions significantly increased the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in rice seedlings following inoculation of two rice pathogens by comparison with the control.

CONCLUSION: The role of chitosan in protection of rice against bacterial pathogens has been shown to involve direct antibacterial activity and indirect induced resistance.
23194296	Characterization of transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis and cellular iron delivery of recombinant human serum transferrin from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Transferrin (TF) plays a critical physiological role in cellular iron delivery via the transferrin receptor (TFR)-mediated endocytosis pathway in nearly all eukaryotic organisms. Human serum TF (hTF) is extensively used as an iron-delivery vehicle in various mammalian cell cultures for production of therapeutic proteins, and is also being explored for use as a drug carrier to treat a number of diseases by employing its unique TFR-mediated endocytosis pathway. With the increasing concerns over the risk of transmission of infectious pathogenic agents of human plasma-derived TF, recombinant hTF is preferred to use for these applications. Here, we carry out comparative studies of the TFR binding, TFR-mediated endocytosis and cellular iron delivery of recombinant hTF from rice (rhTF), and evaluate its suitability for biopharmaceutical applications.

RESULT: Through a TFR competition binding affinity assay with HeLa human cervic carcinoma cells (CCL-2) and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells (HTB-37), we show that rhTF competes similarly as hTF to bind TFR, and both the TFR binding capacity and dissociation constant of rhTF are comparable to that of hTF. The endocytosis assay confirms that rhTF behaves similarly as hTF in the slow accumulation in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and the rapid recycling pathway in HeLa cells. The pulse-chase assay of rhTF in Caco-2 and HeLa cells further illustrates that rice-derived rhTF possesses the similar endocytosis and intracellular processing compared to hTF. The cell culture assays show that rhTF is functionally similar to hTF in the delivery of iron to two diverse mammalian cell lines, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (CCL-240) and murine hybridoma cells derived from a Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma fusion partner (HB-72), for supporting their proliferation, differentiation, and physiological function of antibody production.

CONCLUSION: The functional similarity between rice derived rhTF and native hTF in their cellular iron delivery, TFR binding, and TFR-mediated endocytosis and intracellular processing support that rice-derived rhTF can be used as a safe and animal-free alternative to serum hTF for bioprocessing and biopharmaceutical applications.
23220821	ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	A plant's surface is covered with epicuticular wax, which protects plants from inappropriate environmental conditions such as drought and pathogen attack. Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are the main component of epicuticular wax on the surface of above-ground organs. Here we show that a fatty acid elongase catalyzing an elongation reaction of VLCFAs is required for shoot development in rice. onion2 (oni2) mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination. The midrib of oni2 leaf blades was not developed correctly. Molecular cloning showed that ONI2 encodes a fatty acid elongase, which catalyzes the first step of elongation reactions of a carbon chain of VLCFAs, and oni2 had a reduced amount of VLCFAs. Expression analysis showed that ONI2 is specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of young lateral organs. These results suggest that ONI2 is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice.
23275199	Knockout of the VPS22 component of the ESCRT-II complex in rice (Oryza sativa L.) causes chalky endosperm and early seedling lethality.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	In both yeast and mammals, the major constituent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-II (ESCRT-II) is the VPS22/EAP30 protein, which plays an important role in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of membrane proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. However, the functions of ESCRT-II subunits in plants are largely unknown. In this work, we report the genetic analysis and phenotypic characterization of mutants in OsVPS22 gene, which encodes a functional VPS22 homolog in rice. On the basis of a collection of T-DNA lines, we identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, which showed abnormal segregation ratios; we then found that the T-DNA insertion is located within the sixth intron of the OsVPS22 gene. Compared with the wild type, this vps22 mutant exhibited seedling lethality and severe reduction in shoot and root growth. In addition, the vps22 mutant had a chalky endosperm in the grain. In summary, our data suggest that OsVPS22 may be required for seedling viability and grain filling in rice, thus providing a valuable resource for further exploration of the functions of the ESCRTing machinery in plants.
23250448	Crystal structure of rice importin-α and structural basis of its interaction with plant-specific nuclear localization signals.	2012	Plant Cell	In the classical nucleocytoplasmic import pathway, nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in cargo proteins are recognized by the import receptor importin-α. Importin-α has two separate NLS binding sites (the major and the minor site), both of which recognize positively charged amino acid clusters in NLSs. Little is known about the molecular basis of the unique features of the classical nuclear import pathway in plants. We determined the crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) importin-α1a at 2-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the autoinhibitory mechanism mediated by the importin-β binding domain of importin-α operates in plants, with NLS-mimicking sequences binding to both minor and major NLS binding sites. Consistent with yeast and mammalian proteins, rice importin-α binds the prototypical NLS from simian virus 40 large T-antigen preferentially at the major NLS binding site. We show that two NLSs, previously described as plant specific, bind to and are functional with plant, mammalian, and yeast importin-α proteins but interact with rice importin-α more strongly. The crystal structures of their complexes with rice importin-α show that they bind to the minor NLS binding site. By contrast, the crystal structures of their complexes with mouse (Mus musculus) importin-α show preferential binding to the major NLS binding site. Our results reveal the molecular basis of a number of features of the classical nuclear transport pathway specific to plants.
23263792	Rice glycosyltransferase1 encodes a glycosyltransferase essential for pollen wall formation.	2013	Plant Physiol	The pollen wall consists of an exine and an intine. The mechanism underlying its formation is not well understood. Glycosyltransferases catalyze the modification of biological molecules by attaching a single or multiple sugars and play key roles in a wide range of biological processes. We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa). This gene is highly expressed in mature pollen, and plants containing alleles caused by transfer DNA insertion do not produce homozygous progeny. Reciprocal crosses between OsGT1/osgt1 and the wild type indicated that the mutation leads to a male gametophyte defect. Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains. In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted. In addition, starch and protein levels were much lower in the mutant grains. Recombinant OsGT1 transferred glucose from UDP-glucose to the third and seventh positions of quercetin, a universal substrate of glycosyltransferases. Consistent with the role of OsGT1, an OsGT1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development.
23096910	Chloroplast DNA polymorphism and evolutional relationships between Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relatives (O. rufipogon).	2012	Genet Mol Res	We analyzed chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) polymorphism and phylogenic relationships between 6 typical indica rice, 4 japonica rice, 8 javanica rice, and 12 Asian common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) strains collected from different latitudes in China by comparing polymorphism at 9 highly variable regions. One hundred and forty-four polymorphic bases were detected. The O. rufipogon samples had 117 polymorphic bases, showing rich genetic diversity. One hundred and thirty-one bases at 13 sites were identified with indica/japonica characteristics; they showed differences between the indica and japonica subspecies at these sites. The javanica strains and japonica shared similar bases at these 131 polymorphic sites, suggesting that javanica is closely related to japonica. On the basis of length analyses of the open reading frame (ORF)100 and (ORF)29-tRNA-Cys(GCA) (TrnC(GCA)) fragments, the O. rufipogon strains were classified into indica/japonica subgroups, which was consistent with the results of the phylogenic tree assay based on concatenated datasets. These results indicated that differences in indica and japonica also exist in the cpDNA genome of the O. rufipogon strains. However, these differences demonstrated a certain degree of primitiveness and incompleteness, as an O. rufipogon line may show different indica/ japonica attributes at different sites. Consequently, O. rufipogon cannot be simply classified into the indica/japonica types as O. sativa. Our data support the hypothesis that Asian cultivated rice, O. indica and O. japonica, separately evolved from Asian common wild rice (O. rufipogon) strains, which have different indica-japonica differentiation trends.
23208453	A 286 bp upstream regulatory region of a rice anther-specific gene, OSIPP3, confers pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis.	2013	Biotechnol Lett	OSIPP3 gene (coding for pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein) was isolated from a pre-pollinated inflorescence-specific cDNA library by differential screening of stage-specific libraries from Oryza sativa. OSIPP3 is present in the genome of rice as a single copy gene. OSIPP3 gene was expressed exclusively in the pre-pollinated spikelets of rice. Upstream regulatory region (URR) of OSIPP3 was isolated and a series of 5'-deletions were cloned upstream of GUS reporter gene and were used to transform Arabidopsis. OSIPP3_del1 and del2 transgenic plants showed GUS expression in root, anther and silique, while OSIPP3_del3 showed GUS activity only in anthers and siliques. Pollen-specific expression was observed in case of plants harboring OSIPP3_del4 construct. It can, therefore, be concluded that the OSIPP3 URR between -178 and +108 bp is necessary for conferring pollen-specific expression in Arabidopsis.
23483945	Creation of resveratrol-enriched rice for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and related diseases.	2013	PLoS One	Resveratrol has been clinically shown to possess a number of human health benefits. As a result, many attempts have been made to engineer resveratrol production in major cereal grains but have been largely unsuccessful. In this study, we report the creation of a transgenic rice plant that accumulates 1.9 µg resveratrol/g in its grain, surpassing the previously reported anti-metabolic syndrome activity of resveratrol through a synergistic interaction between the transgenic resveratrol and the endogenous properties of the rice. Consumption of our transgenic resveratrol-enriched rice significantly improved all aspects of metabolic syndrome and related diseases in animals fed a high-fat diet. Compared with the control animals, the resveratrol-enriched rice reduced body weight, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol by 24.7%, 22%, 37.4%, 27%, and 59.6%, respectively. The resveratrol-enriched rice from our study may thus provide a safe and convenient means of preventing metabolic syndrome and related diseases without major lifestyle changes or the need for daily medications. These results also suggest that future transgenic plants could be improved if the synergistic interactions of the transgene with endogenous traits of the plant are considered in the experimental design.
23199012	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa.	2013	Plant J	To explore the physiological significance of N-glycan maturation in the plant Golgi apparatus, gnt1, a mutant with loss of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI) function, was isolated in Oryza sativa. gnt1 exhibited complete inhibition of N-glycan maturation and accumulated high-mannose N-glycans. Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content. The developmental defects of gnt1 ultimately resulted in early lethality without transition to the reproductive stage. However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress. Shoot regeneration and dark-induced leaf senescence assays indicated that the loss of GnTI function results in reduced sensitivity to cytokinin in rice. Reduced expression of A-type O. sativa response regulators that are rapidly induced by cytokinins in gnt1 confirmed that cytokinin signaling is impaired in the mutant. These results strongly support the proposed involvement of N-glycan maturation in transport as well as in the function of membrane proteins that are synthesized via the endomembrane system.
23417074	QTL mapping and confirmation for tolerance of anaerobic conditions during germination derived from the rice landrace Ma-Zhan Red.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Wide adoption of direct-seeded rice practices has been hindered by poorly leveled fields, heavy rainfall and poor drainage, which cause accumulation of water in the fields shortly after sowing, leading to poor crop establishment. This is due to the inability of most rice varieties to germinate and reach the water surface under complete submergence. Hence, tolerance of anaerobic conditions during germination is an essential trait for direct-seeded rice cultivation in both rainfed and irrigated ecosystems. A QTL study was conducted to unravel the genetic basis of tolerance of anaerobic conditions during germination using a population derived from a cross between IR42, a susceptible variety, and Ma-Zhan Red, a tolerant landrace from China. Phenotypic data was collected based on the survival rates of the seedlings at 21 days after sowing of dry seeds under 10 cm of water. QTL analysis of the mapping population consisting of 175 F2:3 families genotyped with 118 SSR markers identified six significant QTLs on chromosomes 2, 5, 6, and 7, and in all cases the tolerant alleles were contributed by Ma-Zhan Red. The largest QTL on chromosome 7, having a LOD score of 14.5 and an R (2) of 31.7 %, was confirmed using a BC2F3 population. The QTLs detected in this study provide promising targets for further genetic characterization and for use in marker-assisted selection to rapidly develop varieties with improved tolerance to anaerobic condition during germination. Ultimately, this trait can be combined with other abiotic stress tolerance QTLs to provide resilient varieties for direct-seeded systems.
23411694	Identification of a dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family that is required for early leaf development in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	A dual-targeted protein belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family was characterized in rice (Oryza sativa) and designated 3'-Phosphoadenosine 5'-Phosphosulfate Transporter1 (PAPST1). The papst1 mutant plants showed a defect in thylakoid development, resulting in leaf chlorosis at an early leaf developmental stage, while normal leaf development was restored 4 to 6 d after leaf emergence. OsPAPST1 is highly expressed in young leaves and roots, while the expression is reduced in mature leaves, in line with the recovery of chloroplast development seen in the older leaves of papst1 mutant plants. OsPAPST1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and chloroplast envelope. Whole-genome transcriptomic analysis reveals reduced expression of genes encoding photosynthetic components (light reactions) in papst1 mutant plants. In addition, sulfur metabolism is also perturbed in papst1 plants, and it was seen that PAPST1 can act as a nucleotide transporter when expressed in Escherichia coli that can be inhibited significantly by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate. Given these findings, together with the altered phenotype seen only when leaves are first exposed to light, it is proposed that PAPST1 may act as a 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate carrier that has been shown to act as a retrograde signal between chloroplasts and the nucleus.
23498867	Rice transglutaminase gene: Identification, protein expression, functionality, light dependence and specific cell location.	2013	Plant Sci	Transglutaminases (TGases), that catalyze post-translational modification of proteins, are scarcely known in plants. As part of a project to characterize transglutaminase genes in new plant species, the identification and characterization of a TGase in rice is presented. Using differential primers, a cDNA (tgo) of 1767bp from genomic rice DNA amplification was obtained. The primers were designed from the rice DNA sequence relatively homologous to the gene encoding active maize chloroplast TGase. Amino acid sequence of the deduced rice TGase protein (TGO) indicated that it contains the enzyme catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp), three repeats, myristoylation domains and a leucine zipper motif. The TGO recombinant protein was characterized, showing specific activity regulation, and indicating that tgo encoded for an authentic TGase. Substrate preference and Ca(2+) dependent activity were also detected. In the rice plant TGO protein was immunolocalized in the grana chloroplasts, in protein vesicles near them, and in the bulliform cells. Immunoblot analyses, tgo mRNA expression, and TGase activity indicated that TGO expression in rice was light dependent and regulated by the illumination period. This work increases significantly our plant TGase understanding. Its functional role in rice, which is a good model system for C3 plants, is discussed.
23400832	Comparison of early transcriptome responses to copper and cadmium in rice roots.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	The phytotoxic effects of copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) on plant growth are well documented. However, Cu and Cd toxicity targets and the cellular systems contributing to acquisition of tolerance are not fully understood at the molecular level. We aimed to identify genes and pathways that discriminate the actions of Cu and Cd in rice roots (Oryza sativa L. cv. TN67). The transcripts of 1,450 and 1,172 genes were regulated after Cu and Cd treatments, respectively. We identified 882 genes specifically respond to Cu treatment, and 604 unique genes as Cd-responsive by comparison of expression profiles of these two regulated gene groups. Gene ontology analysis for 538 genes involved in primary metabolism, oxidation reduction and response to stimulus was changed in response to both metals. In the individual aspect, Cu specifically altered levels of genes involved in vesicle trafficking transport, fatty acid metabolism and cellular component biogenesis. Cd-regulated genes related to unfolded protein binding and sulfate assimilation. To further characterize the functions of vesicle trafficking transport under Cu stress, interference of excytosis in root tissues was conducted by inhibitors and silencing of Exo70 genes. It was demonstrated that vesicle-trafficking is required for mediation of Cu-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in root tissues. These results may provide new insights into understanding the molecular basis of the early metal stress response in plants.
23365013	Spatio-temporal reconstruction of air temperature maps and their application to estimate rice growing season heat accumulation using multi-temporal MODIS data.	2013	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	The accumulation of thermal time usually represents the local heat resources to drive crop growth. Maps of temperature-based agro-meteorological indices are commonly generated by the spatial interpolation of data collected from meteorological stations with coarse geographic continuity. To solve the critical problems of estimating air temperature (T(a)) and filling in missing pixels due to cloudy and low-quality images in growing degree days (GDDs) calculation from remotely sensed data, a novel spatio-temporal algorithm for T(a) estimation from Terra and Aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was proposed. This is a preliminary study to calculate heat accumulation, expressed in accumulative growing degree days (AGDDs) above 10 °C, from reconstructed T(a) based on MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data. The verification results of maximum T(a), minimum T(a), GDD, and AGDD from MODIS-derived data to meteorological calculation were all satisfied with high correlations over 0.01 significant levels. Overall, MODIS-derived AGDD was slightly underestimated with almost 10% relative error. However, the feasibility of employing AGDD anomaly maps to characterize the 2001-2010 spatio-temporal variability of heat accumulation and estimating the 2011 heat accumulation distribution using only MODIS data was finally demonstrated in the current paper. Our study may supply a novel way to calculate AGDD in heat-related study concerning crop growth monitoring, agricultural climatic regionalization, and agro-meteorological disaster detection at the regional scale.
23382235	NADPH oxidases regulate septin-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling during plant infection by the rice blast fungus.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae infects plants with a specialized cell called an appressorium, which uses turgor to drive a rigid penetration peg through the rice leaf cuticle. Here, we show that NADPH oxidases (Nox) are necessary for septin-mediated reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton to facilitate cuticle rupture and plant cell invasion. We report that the Nox2-NoxR complex spatially organizes a heteroligomeric septin ring at the appressorium pore, required for assembly of a toroidal F-actin network at the point of penetration peg emergence. Maintenance of the cortical F-actin network during plant infection independently requires Nox1, a second NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for penetration hypha elongation. Organization of F-actin in appressoria is disrupted by application of antioxidants, whereas latrunculin-mediated depolymerization of appressorial F-actin is competitively inhibited by reactive oxygen species, providing evidence that regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species by fungal NADPH oxidases directly controls septin and F-actin dynamics.
23408830	The role of VuMATE1 expression in aluminium-inducible citrate secretion in rice bean (Vigna umbellata) roots.	2013	J Exp Bot	Aluminium (Al)-activated citrate secretion plays an important role in Al resistance in a number of plant species, such as rice bean (Vigna umbellata). This study further characterized the regulation of VuMATE1, an aluminium-activated citrate transporter. Al stress induced VuMATE1 expression, followed by the secretion of citrate. Citrate secretion was specific to Al stress, whereas VuMATE1 expression was not, which could be explained by a combined regulation of VuMATE1 expression and Al-specific activation of VuMATE1 protein. Pre-treatment with a protein translation inhibitor suppressed VuMATE1 expression, indicating that de novo biosynthesis of proteins is required for gene expression. Furthermore, post-treatment with a protein translation inhibitor inhibited citrate secretion, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 is critical for citrate secretion. Protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitor studies showed that reversible phosphorylation was important not only for transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 expression but also for post-translational regulation of VuMATE1 protein activity. These results suggest that citrate secretion is dependent on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1. Additionally, VuMATE1 promoter-β-glucuronidase fusion lines revealed that VuMATE1 expression was restricted to the root apex and was entirely Al induced, indicating the presence of cis-acting elements regulating root tip-specific and Al-inducible gene expression, which will be an important resource for genetic improvement of plant Al resistance.
23527858	Dual positional substrate specificity of rice allene oxide synthase-1: insight into mechanism of inhibition by type II ligand imidazole.	2013	BMB Rep	Phylogenetic and amino acid sequence analysis indicated that rice allene oxide synthase-1 (OsAOS1) is CYP74, and is clearly distinct from CYP74B, C and D subfamilies. Regio- and stereo-chemical analysis revealed the dual substrate specificity of OsAOS1 for (cis,trans)-configurational isomers of 13(S)- and 9(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. GC-MS analysis showed that OsAOS1 converts 13(S)- and 9(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadi(tri)enoic acid into their corresponding allene oxide. UV-Visible spectral analysis of native OsAOS1 revealed a Soret maximum at 393 nm, which shifted to 424 nm with several clean isobestic points upon binding of OsAOS1 to imidazole. The spectral shift induced by imidazole correlated with inhibition of OsAOS1 activity, implying that imidazole may coordinate to ferric heme iron, triggering a heme-iron transition from high spin state to low spin state. The implications and significance of a putative type II ligand-induced spin state transition in OsAOS1 are discussed.
23537632	A conserved genetic pathway determines inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Dev Cell	The spatiotemporal architecture of inflorescences that bear flowers determines plant reproductive success by affecting fruit set and plant interaction with pollinators. The inflorescence architecture that displays great diversity across flowering plants depends on developmental decisions at inflorescence meristems. Here we report a key conserved genetic pathway determining inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). In Arabidopsis, four MADS-box genes, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, AGAMOUS-LIKE 24, and SEPALLATA 4 act redundantly and directly to suppress TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) in emerging floral meristems. This is indispensable for the well-known function of APETALA1 in specifying floral meristems and is coupled with a conformational change in chromosome looping at the TFL1 locus. Similarly, we demonstrate that the orthologs of these MADS-box genes in rice determine panicle branching by regulating TFL1-like genes. Our findings reveal a conserved regulatory pathway that determines inflorescence architecture in flowering plants.
23632162	PlantGSEA: a gene set enrichment analysis toolkit for plant community.	2013	Nucleic Acids Res	Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful method for interpreting biological meaning of a list of genes by computing the overlaps with various previously defined gene sets. As one of the most widely used annotations for defining gene sets, Gene Ontology (GO) system has been used in many enrichment analysis tools. EasyGO and agriGO, two GO enrichment analysis toolkits developed by our laboratory, have gained extensive usage and citations since their releases because of their effective performance and consistent maintenance. Responding to the increasing demands of more comprehensive analysis from the users, we developed a web server as an important component of our bioinformatics analysis toolkit, named PlantGSEA, which is based on GSEA method and mainly focuses on plant organisms. In PlantGSEA, 20 290 defined gene sets deriving from different resources were collected and used for GSEA analysis. The PlantGSEA currently supports gene locus IDs and Affymatrix microarray probe set IDs from four plant model species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Gossypium raimondii). The PlantGSEA is an efficient and user-friendly web server, and now it is publicly accessible at http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/PlantGSEA.
23591851	Detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistances to small brown planthopper and rice stripe virus in rice using recombinant inbred lines.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Small brown planthopper (SBPH) and rice stripe virus (RSV) disease transmitted by SBPH cause serious damage to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China. In the present study, we screened 312 rice accessions for resistance to SBPH. The indica variety, N22, is highly resistant to SBPH. One hundred and eighty two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of N22 and the highly susceptible variety, USSR5, were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of resistances to SBPH and RSV. In a modified seedbox screening test, three QTLs for SBPH resistance, qSBPH2, qSBPH3 and qSBPH7.1, were mapped on chromosomes 2, 3 and 7, a total explaining 35.1% of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH7.2 and qSBPH11.2, conferring antibiosis against SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 and accounted for 20.7% of the total phenotypic variance. In addition, qSBPH5 and qSBPH7.3, expressing antixenosis to SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 5 and 7, explaining 23.9% of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH7.1, qSBPH7.2 and qSBPH7.3, located in the same region between RM234 and RM429 on chromosome 7, using three different phenotyping methods indicate that the locus or region plays a major role in conferring resistance to SBPH in N22. Moreover, three QTLs, qSTV4, qSTV11.1 and qSTV11.2, for RSV resistance were detected on chromosomes 4 and 11. qSTV11.1 and qSTV11.2 are located in the same region between RM287 and RM209 on chromosome 11. Molecular markers spanning these QTLs should be useful in the development of varieties with resistance to SBPH and RSV.
23633166	Activity of chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam seed treatments on life stages of the rice water weevil as affected by the distribution of insecticides in rice plants.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The systemic insecticides chlorantraniliprole (CAP) and thiamethoxam (TMX), applied to rice as seed treatments, may affect multiple life stages of the rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus. Effects of CAP and TMX on adult survival, egg-laying and first- and late-instar survivals were determined by infesting plants treated as seeds with different rates of insecticides. The biological activity was related to insecticidal concentrations in leaves, shoots and roots.

RESULTS: CAP did not affect adult survival but decreased egg numbers and reduced the survival of the first and late instars. The greatest reduction in weevil population occurred in late instars feeding on roots. In contrast, TMX reduced adult survival and egg and larval numbers. The high biological activity of CAP on root-feeding stages was consistent with the accumulation of CAP in roots, whereas in TMX-treated plants the high activity on adults correlated with high concentrations of TMX in leaves and stems.

CONCLUSIONS: The differential activity of insecticides on adults suggests poor inherent potency of CAP as an adulticide and/or its limited systemicity in foliage. The distribution of insecticide in specific plant parts can be attributed to the different physicochemical properties of CAP and TMX. The field implications of this research on management of L. oryzophilus are discussed.
23605590	Identification and characterization of the interaction between viroplasm-associated proteins from two different plant-infecting reoviruses and eEF-1A of rice.	2013	Arch Virol	A rice protein homologous to eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF-1A) was found to interact with the Pns6 of rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), the type member of the genus Oryzavirus, family Reoviridae, in yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction between the rice protein, designated OseEF-1A, and RRSV Pns6 was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Besides Pns6, OseEF-1A also interacted with the viroplasm matrix protein, Pns10, of RRSV. When expressed together, OseEF-1A co-localized with RRSV Pns10 in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. Pns6 of southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a newly reported member of the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae, was the only non-structural SRBSDV protein studied here that also interacted with OseEF-1A. Like Pns6 of rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), SRBSDV Pns6 interacted with itself and co-localized with Pns9-1 in N. benthamiana. In the presence of Pns6, OseEF-1A co-localized with Pns9-1, the putative viroplasm matrix protein of SRBSDV.
23621499	OsRRMh, a Spen-like gene, plays an important role during the vegetative to reproductive transition in rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	OsRRMh, a homologue of OsRRM, encodes a Spen-like protein, and is composed of two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and one C-terminal Spen paralogue and an orthologue C-terminal domain (SPOC). The gene has been found to be constitutively expressed in the root, stem, leaf, spikelet, and immature seed, and alternative splicing patterns were confirmed in different tissues, which may indicate diverse functions for OsRRMh. The OsRRMh dsRNAi lines exhibited late-flowering and a larger panicle phenotype. When full-length OsRRMh and/or its SPOC domain were overexpressed, the fertility rate and number of spikelets per panicle were both markedly reduced. Also, overexpression of OsRRMh in the Arabidopsis fpa mutant did not restore the normal flowering time, and it delayed flowering in Col plants. Therefore, we propose that OsRRMh may confer one of its functions in the vegetative-to-reproductive transition in rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica cv. Zhonghua No. 11 (ZH11)).
23118960	The rice B-box zinc finger gene family: genomic identification, characterization, expression profiling and diurnal analysis.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The B-box (BBX) -containing proteins are a class of zinc finger proteins that contain one or two B-box domains and play important roles in plant growth and development. The Arabidopsis BBX gene family has recently been re-identified and renamed. However, there has not been a genome-wide survey of the rice BBX (OsBBX) gene family until now.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we identified 30 rice BBX genes through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Each gene was assigned a uniform nomenclature. We described the chromosome localizations, gene structures, protein domains, phylogenetic relationship, whole life-cycle expression profile and diurnal expression patterns of the OsBBX family members. Based on the phylogeny and domain constitution, the OsBBX gene family was classified into five subfamilies. The gene duplication analysis revealed that only chromosomal segmental duplication contributed to the expansion of the OsBBX gene family. The expression profile of the OsBBX genes was analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays throughout the entire life-cycle of rice cultivar Zhenshan 97 (ZS97). In addition, microarray analysis was performed to obtain the expression patterns of these genes under light/dark conditions and after three phytohormone treatments. This analysis revealed that the expression patterns of the OsBBX genes could be classified into eight groups. Eight genes were regulated under the light/dark treatments, and eleven genes showed differential expression under at least one phytohormone treatment. Moreover, we verified the diurnal expression of the OsBBX genes using the data obtained from the Diurnal Project and qPCR analysis, and the results indicated that many of these genes had a diurnal expression pattern.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of the genome-wide identification and the expression and diurnal analysis of the OsBBX gene family should facilitate additional functional studies of the OsBBX genes.
23048130	Improving the nutritive value of rice seeds: elevation of cysteine and methionine contents in rice plants by ectopic expression of a bacterial serine acetyltransferase.	2012	J Exp Bot	With the aim of increasing the cysteine level in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and thus improving its nutritional quality, transgenic rice plants were generated expressing an Escherichia coli serine acetyltransferase isoform (EcSAT), the enzyme synthesizing O-acetylserine, the precursor of cysteine. The gene was fused to the transit peptide of the Arabidopsis Rubisco and driven by a ubiquitin promoter to target the enzyme to plastids. Twenty-two transgenic plants were examined for transgene protein expression, and five lines with a high expression level and enzymatic activity, respectively, were selected for further analysis. In these lines, the contents of cysteine and glutathione increased 2.4-fold and 2-fold, respectively. More important is the increase in free methionine and methionine incorporated into the water-soluble protein fraction in seeds. Free methionine increased in leaves up to 2.7-fold, in seeds up to 1.4-fold, and bound to seed proteins up to 4.8-fold, respectively, while the bound methionine level remained constant or even decreased in leaves. Notably, the transgenic lines exhibited higher isoleucine, leucine, and valine contents (each up to 2-fold depending on tissue, free, or bound), indicating a potential conversion of methionine via methionine γ-lyase to isoleucine. As the transgenic rice plants overexpressing EcSAT had significantly higher levels of both soluble and protein-bound methionine, isoleucine, cysteine, and glutathione in rice they may represent a model and target system for improving the nutritional quality of cereal crops.
22957820	Development of a variable number of tandem repeats typing scheme for the bacterial rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2012	Phytopathology	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola is an important bacterial pathogen responsible for outbreaks of bacterial leaf streak (BLS) on rice, mostly occurring in Asia and parts of Africa. To better monitor epidemics and assess population structures, efficient tools that allow the precise identification and diagnosis of pathogenic populations are needed. In this study, we explored variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) as a fast, reliable, and cost-effective molecular typing tool. Screening of three X. oryzae pv. oryzicola genome sequences (Philippine strain BLS256, Chinese strain GX01, and Malian strain MAI10) predicted 28 candidate VNTR loci. Primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 28 loci were designed and applied to a panel of 20 X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains originating from Asia and Africa. Sequencing of PCR amplicons revealed 25 robust and polymorphic VNTR loci that are shared among Asian and African X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. A dendrogram constructed from 25 VNTR loci indicated that most Asian strains are clearly discriminated from African strains. However, in agreement with previous reports, one strain from Mali is related to Asian strains, pointing to a possible introduction of Asian strains to the African continent. The new VNTR-based tool described here is useful for studies of population structures and epidemiological monitoring of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola.
23311133	[Comparison of codon optimizations of cry1Ah1 gene in rice].	2012	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	cry1Ah1, one of holo-type cry genes, cloned in this laboratory from Bacillus thuringiensis strain has been patented in China, and it encoded a protein with strong insecticidal activity against certain lepidopteran insect pests, such as Chilo suppressalis. cry1Ah1 gene is exhibiting good application prospects. In order to improve the expression level of cry1Ah1 gene in rice, and investigate the effect of codon usage preference of gene expression, we designed five different optimized schemes for cry1Ah1 insecticidal critical fragment in accordance with bias of rice codon, to improve G+C content, removed the shear signal and unstable factors. Optimized cry1Ah1 genes were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) respectively, and 65 kDa polypeptides was expressed normally in inclusion body separately. All of these expressed polypeptides showed insecticidal activity against 2nd-instar larvae of Plutella xylostella and neonate of Chilo suppressalis. After transformation with modified cry1Ah1 genes into Var nippobare, the transgenic rice seedlings were detected by PCR, the positive rate containing target gene was more than 87%. Afterwards, the results of real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assay indicated that the highest expression level of five modified cry1Ah1 genes was that using the highest frequent codons. Average expression amount of Cry1Ah1 polypeptides was 0.104% of total soluble proteins from the positive transgenic rice.
23078195	Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors targeting OsSWEET genes enhance virulence on diverse rice (Oryza sativa) varieties when expressed individually in a TAL effector-deficient strain of Xanthomonas oryzae.	2012	New Phytol	Genomes of the rice (Oryza sativa) xylem and mesophyll pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and pv. oryzicola (Xoc) encode numerous secreted transcription factors called transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors. In a few studied rice varieties, some of these contribute to virulence by activating corresponding host susceptibility genes. Some activate disease resistance genes. The roles of X. oryzae TAL effectors in diverse rice backgrounds, however, are poorly understood. Xoo TAL effectors that promote infection by activating SWEET sucrose transporter genes were expressed in TAL effector-deficient X. oryzae strain X11-5A, and assessed in 21 rice varieties. Some were also tested in Xoc on variety Nipponbare. Several Xoc TAL effectors were tested in X11-5A on four rice varieties. Xoo TAL effectors enhanced X11-5A virulence on most varieties, but to varying extents depending on the effector and variety. SWEET genes were activated in all tested varieties, but increased virulence did not correlate with activation level. SWEET activators also enhanced Xoc virulence on Nipponbare. Xoc TAL effectors did not alter X11-5A virulence. SWEET-targeting TAL effectors contribute broadly and non-tissue-specifically to virulence in rice, and their function is affected by host differences besides target sequences. Further, the utility of X11-5A for characterizing individual TAL effectors in rice was established.
23072575	Nitric oxide generated by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae drives plant infection.	2013	New Phytol	Plant-derived nitric oxide (NO) triggers defence, priming the onset of the hypersensitive response and restricting pathogen ingress during incompatibility. However, little is known about the role of pathogen-produced NO during pre-infection development and infection. We sought evidence for NO production by the rice blast fungus during early infection. NO production was measured using fluorescence of DAR-4M and the role of NO assessed using NO scavengers. The synthesis of NO was investigated by targeted knockout of genes potentially involved in NO synthesis, including nitric oxide synthase-like genes (NOL2 and NOL3) and nitrate (NIA1) and nitrite reductase (NII1), generating single and double Δnia1Δnii1, Δnia1Δnol3, and Δnol2Δnol3 mutants. We demonstrate that Magnaporthe oryzae generates NO during germination and in early development. Removal of NO delays germling development and reduces disease lesion numbers. NO is not generated by the candidate proteins tested, nor by other arginine-dependent NO systems, by polyamine oxidase activity or non-enzymatically by low pH. Furthermore, we show that, while NIA1 and NII1 are essential for nitrate assimilation, NIA1, NII1, NOL2 and NOL3 are all dispensable for pathogenicity. Development of M. oryzae and initiation of infection are critically dependent on fungal NO synthesis, but its mode of generation remains obscure.
23160806	Functional relevance of J-protein family of rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Cell Stress Chaperones	Protein folding and disaggregation are crucial processes for survival of cells under unfavorable conditions. A network of molecular chaperones supports these processes. Collaborative action of Hsp70 and Hsp100 proteins is an important component of this network. J-proteins/DnaJ members as co-chaperones assist Hsp70. As against 22 DnaJ sequences noted in yeast, rice genome contains 104 J-genes. Rice J-genes were systematically classified into type A (12 sequences), type B (9 sequences), and type C (83 sequences) classes and a scheme of nomenclature of these proteins is proposed. Transcript expression profiles revealed that J-proteins are possibly involved in basal cellular activities, developmental programs, and in stress. Ydj1 is the most abundant J-protein in yeast. Ydj1 deleted yeast cells are nonviable at 37 °C. Two rice ortholog proteins of yeast Ydj1 protein namely OsDjA4 and OsDjA5 successfully rescued the growth defect in mutant yeast. As Hsp70 and J-proteins work in conjunction, it emerges that rice J-proteins can partner with yeast Hsp70 proteins in functioning. It is thus shown that J-protein machine is highly conserved.
23147221	Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	BTF3, which was originally recognized as a basal transcription factor, has been known to be involved in transcription initiation, translational regulation and protein localization in many eukaryotic organisms. However, its function remains largely unknown in plant species. In the present study, we analyzed a BTF3-related sequence in Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica, which shares the conserved domain of a nascent polypeptide-associated complex with human BTF3, and was referred to as Osj10gBTF3. The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress. The Osj10gBTF3::EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasmic membrane system. Inhibition of Osj10gBTF3 led to significant morphological changes in all detected tissues and organs, with a reduced size of between 25% and 52%. Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82. These findings were verified through a yeast two-hybrid assay using a Nipponbare callus cDNA library as bait followed by the reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total leaf or anther RNAs. Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants.
23155476	Expression profile in rice panicle: insights into heat response mechanism at reproductive stage.	2012	PLoS One	Rice at reproductive stage is more sensitive to environmental changes, and little is known about the mechanism of heat response in rice panicle. Here, using rice microarray, we provided a time course gene expression profile of rice panicle at anther developmental stage 8 after 40°C treatment for 0 min, 20 min, 60 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h. The identified differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, cellular homeostasis, and stress response. The predominant transcription factor gene families responsive to heat stress were Hsf, NAC, AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, and C(2)H(2). KMC analysis discovered the time-dependent gene expression pattern under heat stress. The motif co-occurrence analysis on the promoters of genes from an early up-regulated cluster showed the important roles of GCC box, HSE, ABRE, and CE3 in response to heat stress. The regulation model central to ROS combined with transcriptome and ROS quantification data in rice panicle indicated the great importance to maintain ROS balance and the existence of wide cross-talk in heat response. The present study increased our understanding of the heat response in rice panicle and provided good candidate genes for crop improvement.
23202292	Rice (Oryza sativa) lipase: molecular cloning, functional expression and substrate specificity.	2013	Protein Expr Purif	Lipases are important biocatalysts showing many interesting properties with industrial applications. Previously, different isoforms of lipases, Lipase-I and Lipase-II from rice (Oryza sativa) have been purified and characterized. Lipase-II identified as the major lipase in rice bran is designated as rice bran lipase (RBL). In this study, we report the cloning and expression of the RBL in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. An exploration of expression in four different E. coli expression systems analyzed: BL21(DE3)pLysS, RIL(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta(DE3)pLysS and Origami(DE3)pLysS indicated that E. coli was not a suitable host. Expression with supplement of rare codons in Rosetta (DE3)pLysS and RIL(DE3)pLysS resulted in highest expression as insoluble inclusion bodies. The hurdles of expression in E. coli were overcome by expression as a secretory protein in P. pastoris X-33. The expression of lipase in shake flasks was optimized to achieve the maximum recombinant lipase activity of 152.6 U/mL. The purified recombinant lipase had a specific activity of 998 U/mg toward triacetin. The pH and temperature optimum of native and recombinant enzymes were pH 7.4 and 25 ± 2 °C, respectively. Both the lipases showed higher activity toward short chain triacylglycerol and unsaturated fatty acid enriched oils. Computational modeling and molecular docking studies reveal that the catalytic efficiency of the lipase correlates with the distance of the nucleophilic Ser(175)-OH and the scissile ester bond. The shorter the distance, the greater is the turnover of the substrate.
23122787	Differential subcellular localization, enzymatic properties and expression patterns of γ-aminobutyric acid transaminases (GABA-Ts) in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	J Plant Physiol	γ-Aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) catalyzes the conversion of GABA to succinic semialdehyde. The rice (Oryza sativa) genome possesses four putative GABA-T genes, which exhibit high amino acid identity (73-82%) but differ in length of the N-terminal region. Transient expression of GABA-T-green fluorescent fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that two of the four enzymes were targeted to mitochondria, a third to chloroplasts, and the fourth to cytosol. Enzymatic analysis of three organelle-targeted GABA-Ts revealed that they used pyruvate and glyoxylate as amino acceptors and that two of the enzymes functioned in mitochondria and chloroplasts at similar levels of activity, whereas the second mitochondrial enzyme displayed very low activity. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that two of the four genes were more highly expressed in the vegetative organs tested, but exhibited a different pattern during seed maturation. Together, these results suggest that members of the rice GABA-T gene family vary in many respects, such as intracellular targeting, enzymatic activity and regulation of gene expression.
23139845	Simultaneous RNA-seq analysis of a mixed transcriptome of rice and blast fungus interaction.	2012	PLoS One	A filamentous fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a causal agent of rice blast disease, which is one of the most serious diseases affecting cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying both rice defense and fungal attack are not yet fully understood. Extensive past studies have characterized many infection-responsive genes in the pathogen and host plant, separately. To understand the plant-pathogen interaction comprehensively, it is valuable to monitor the gene expression profiles of both interacting organisms simultaneously in the same infected plant tissue. Although the host-pathogen interaction during the initial infection stage is important for the establishment of infection, the detection of fungal gene expression in infected leaves at the stage has been difficult because very few numbers of fungal cells are present. Using the emerging RNA-Seq technique, which has a wide dynamic range for expression analyses, we analyzed the mixed transcriptome of rice and blast fungus in infected leaves at 24 hours post-inoculation, which is the point when the primary infection hyphae penetrate leaf epidermal cells. We demonstrated that our method detected the gene expression of both the host plant and pathogen simultaneously in the same infected leaf blades in natural infection conditions without any artificial treatments. The upregulation of 240 fungal transcripts encoding putative secreted proteins was observed, suggesting that these candidates of fungal effector genes may play important roles in initial infection processes. The upregulation of transcripts encoding glycosyl hydrolases, cutinases and LysM domain-containing proteins were observed in the blast fungus, whereas pathogenesis-related and phytoalexin biosynthetic genes were upregulated in rice. Furthermore, more drastic changes in expression were observed in the incompatible interactions compared with the compatible ones in both rice and blast fungus at this stage. Our mixed transcriptome analysis is useful for the simultaneous elucidation of the tactics of host plant defense and pathogen attack.
23145152	Bioinformatic analysis of epigenetic and microRNA mediated regulation of drought responsive genes in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Drought stress response is a complex trait regulated at multiple levels. Changes in the epigenetic and miRNA regulatory landscape can dramatically alter the outcome of a stress response. However, little is known about the scope and extent of these regulatory factors on drought related cellular processes and functions. To this end, we selected a list of 5468 drought responsive genes (DRGs) of rice identified in multiple microarray studies and mapped the DNA methylation regions found in a genome wide methylcytosine immunoprecipitation and sequencing (mCIP-Seq) study to their genic and promoter regions, identified the chromatin remodeling genes and the genes that are targets of miRNAs. We found statistically significant enrichment of DNA methylation reads and miRNA target sequences in DRGs compared to a random set of genes. About 75% of the DRGs annotated to be involved in chromatin remodeling were downregulated. We found one-third of the DRGs are targeted by two-thirds of all known/predicted miRNAs in rice which include many transcription factors targeted by more than five miRNAs. Clustering analysis of the DRGs with epigenetic and miRNA features revealed, upregulated cluster was enriched in drought tolerance mechanisms while the downregulated cluster was enriched in drought resistance mechanisms evident by their unique gene ontologies (GOs), protein-protein interactions (PPIs), specific transcription factors, protein domains and metabolic pathways. Further, we analyzed the proteome of two weeks old young rice plants treated with a global demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), subjected to drought stress and identified 56 protein spots that are differentially expressed. Out of the 56 spots, 35 were differently expressed in the sample with both demethylation and drought stress treatments and 28 (50%) were part of DRGs considered in the bioinformatic analysis.
23203890	OrysPSSP: a comparative platform for small secreted proteins from rice and other plants.	2013	Nucleic Acids Res	Plants have large diverse families of small secreted proteins (SSPs) that play critical roles in the processes of development, differentiation, defense, flowering, stress response, symbiosis, etc. Oryza sativa is one of the major crops worldwide and an excellent model for monocotyledonous plants. However, there had not been any effort to systematically analyze rice SSPs. Here, we constructed a comparative platform, OrysPSSP (http://www.genoportal.org/PSSP/index.do), involving >100 000 SSPs from rice and 25 plant species. OrysPSSP is composed of a core SSP database and a dynamic web interface that integrates a variety of user tools and resources. The current release (v0530) of core SSP database contains a total of 101 048 predicted SSPs, which were generated through a rigid computation/curation pipeline. The web interface consists of eight different modules, providing users with rich resources/functions, e.g. browsing SSP by chromosome, searching and filtering SSP, validating SSP with omics data, comparing SSP among multiple species and querying core SSP database with BLAST. Some cases of application are discussed to demonstrate the utility of OrysPSSP. OrysPSSP serves as a comprehensive resource to explore SSP on the genome scale and across the phylogeny of plant species.
23251660	Positive crosstalk of MAMP signaling pathways in rice cells.	2012	PLoS One	Plants have evolved efficient defense mechanisms known as priming and synergy, both of which can mobilize defense responses more extensively against successive pathogen invasion or simultaneous stimulation by different signal molecules. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena were largely unknown. In the present study, we used cultured rice cells and combination of purified MAMP molecules as a model system to study the mechanisms of these phenomena. We found that the pretreatment of rice cells with a low concentration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) apparently primed the defense responses induced by successive N-acetylchitooctaose (GN8) treatment. On the other hand, simultaneous treatment with GN8 and LPS also resulted in the similar enhancement of defense responses observed for the LPS-induced priming, indicating that the synergistic effects of these MAMPs are basically responsible for such enhancement of defense responses, though the effect could be interpreted as "priming" under some experimental conditions. These results also indicate that such a positive crosstalk of signaling cascade downstream of MAMP receptors seems to occur very rapidly, probably at early step(s) of signaling pathway. Comprehensive analysis of phytohormones revealed a specific enhancement of the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), both in the LPS pretreatment and also simultaneous treatment, indicating a role of JA in the enhancement of downstream responses.
23227161	Identification and comparative analysis of microRNAs associated with low-N tolerance in rice genotypes.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Nitrogen [N] is a critical limiting nutrient for plants and has to be exogenously supplied to many crops, to achieve high yield with significant economic and environmental costs, specifically for rice. Development of low-input nitrogen sustainable crop is necessary for sustainable agriculture. Identification of regulatory elements associated with low-N tolerance is imperative for formulating innovative approaches for developing low-N tolerant crop plants, using gene manipulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play crucial roles in the modulation of gene expression in plants under various environmental conditions.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MiRNAs associated with low-N tolerance have not been identified so far. In this study, we investigated microarray-based miRNA expression in low-N tolerant and low-N sensitive rice genotypes under low N condition. Expressions of 32 miRNAs differed significantly in the two genotypes. Of these 32 miRNAs, expressions of nine miRNAs were further validated experimentally in leaves as well as in roots. Of these differentially expressed miRNAs, six miRNAs (miR156, miR164, miR528, miR820, miR821 and miR1318) were reported in leaves and four (miR164, miR167, miR168 and miR528) in roots. Target genes of all the 32 miRNAs were predicted, which encode transcription factors, and proteins associated with metabolic processes or stress responses. Expression levels of some of the corresponding miRNA targets were analysed and found to be significantly higher in low N-tolerant genotype than low-N sensitive genotype. These findings suggested that miRNAs played an important role in low-N tolerance in rice.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genome-wide differences in expression of miRNA in low N-tolerant and low N-sensitive rice genotypes were reported. This provides a platform for selection as well as manipulation of genotypes for better N utilization efficiency.
23243128	BRK1, a Bub1-related kinase, is essential for generating proper tension between homologous kinetochores at metaphase I of rice meiosis.	2012	Plant Cell	Bub1 (for budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1), one of the main spindle checkpoint kinases, acts as a kinetochore scaffold for assembling other checkpoint proteins. Here, we identify a plant Bub1-related kinase 1 (BRK1) in rice (Oryza sativa). The brk1 mutants are sterile due to the precocious separation of sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase I. The centromeric recruitment of SHUGOSHIN1 and phosphorylation of histone H2A at Thr-134 (H2A-pT134) depend on BRK1. Although the homologs can faithfully separate from each other at the end of meiosis I, the uncorrected merotelic attachment of paired sister kinetochores at the early stage of metaphase I in brk1 reduces the tension across homologous kinetochores, causes the metaphase I spindle to be aberrantly shaped, and subsequently affects the synchronicity of homolog separation at the onset of anaphase I. In addition, the phosphorylation of inner centromeric histone H3 at Ser-10 (H3-pS10) during diakinesis depends on BRK1. Therefore, we speculate that BRK1 may be required for normal localization of Aurora kinase before the onset of metaphase I, which is responsible for correcting the merotelic attachment.
23559856	Comparative proteomics analysis of degenerative eye lenses of nocturnal rice eel and catfish as compared to diurnal zebrafish.	2013	Mol Vis	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the lens crystallin diversity of degenerative eyes from the rice eel (Monopterus albus) and walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) as compared to that of zebrafish (Danio rerio) by using comparative proteomics methodologies. We endeavored to investigate the evolution of vertebrate lenses particularly concerning the functional loss of lenses in degenerative eyes of rice eels and catfishes living under an environment of perpetual darkness.

METHODS: Fish lenses were collected and homogenized to extract total soluble proteins. The protein mixtures were separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1D or 2D gel), plus the newer gel-free shotgun proteomic strategy, followed by in-gel digestion and subjection of the digested protein bands or spots to liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The proteomics data were analyzed and compared based on the proteomics databank of zebrafish. The soluble lens protein solutions of three piscine species were also processed by gel-filtration chromatography and 1D sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the comparison and validation of various crystallin families, e.g., α-, β-, and γ-crystallins.

RESULTS: In zebrafish eye lenses, γ-crystallin constituted about 71% and α- and β-crystallins comprised 30% of total lens proteins. In rice eel lenses, very little or almost no α-crystallins were detected and β- and γ-crystallins comprised more than 98% of total lens proteins. In catfish lenses, α- and β-crystallins comprised about 40% and γ-crystallin constitutes 60% of total lens proteins. It was of interest to find that α-crystallin was totally absent in the rice eel in contrast to the presence, albeit with very low amounts, of α-crystallin in similarly nocturnal catfish. The ratio of α-crystallin subunits (αA/αB) was found to be about 20:1 for the catfish lens, in great contrast to the ratio of about 3:1 found for most mammalian lenses. In contrast, β- and γ-crystallins were more abundant in lenses of these three piscine species, similar to mammalian lenses. By proteomics analysis, the most abundant β-crystallins were found to comprise a diverse group of βA1a, βA1-2, βA2a, βA2-2, βA4, βB1, βB2, and βB3 subunit crystallins; the monomeric γ-crystallin class contains γB, γD, γM2, γM3, γM5, γM7, γN-A, γN-B, γS1, and γS2 crystallins.

CONCLUSIONS: In cave or nocturnal animals, the eye is sometimes reduced or eliminated because of adaptation to life in visual darkness. The comparative proteomics analysis of degenerative and normal lenses forms a firm molecular basis to investigate further the evolution of piscine lenses in the future. The total numbers of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins in the three fish species as revealed by the current proteomics methodology clearly indicate the complexity and diversity of crystallin species present in the piscine class of vertebrates. The unexpected finding that α-crystallin is absent in the degenerative eye lenses of rice eel may have some bearing on the chaperone function of α-crystallin in regard to its protective role of preventing protein aggregation in diurnal vertebrate lenses to maintain functional transparency.
23324170	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Nitrogen is the most important macronutrient in plants and its supply induces responses in gene expression, metabolism and developmental processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the nitrogen responses remain poorly understood. Here we show that the supply of nitrate but not ammonium immediately induces the expression of a transcriptional repressor gene in rice, designated NIGT1 (Nitrate-Inducible, GARP-type Transcriptional Repressor 1). The results of DNA-binding site selection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that NIGT1 binds to DNA containing either of two consensus sequences, GAATC or GAATATTC. In transient reporter assays, NIGT1 was found to repress transcription from the promoters containing the identified NIGT1-binding sequences in vivo. Furthermore, NIGT1 repressed the activity of its own promoter, suggesting an autorepression mechanism. Consistently, nitrate-induced NIGT1 expression was found to be down-regulated after a transient peak during nitrate treatment, and the nitrate-induced expression of NIGT1 decreased in transgenic rice plants in which this gene was constitutively overexpressed. Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in NIGT1 overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium. Thus, we propose NIGT1 as a nitrate-inducible and autorepressible transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the nitrogen response in rice. Taken together with the fact that the NIGT1-binding sites are conserved in promoter sequences of Arabidopsis NIGT1 homologs, our findings imply the presence of a time-dependent complex system for nitrate-responsive transcriptional regulation that is conserved in both monocots and dicots.
23331415	Characterization of a newly identified rice chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) homologous to xylanase inhibitor.	2013	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: During rice blast fungal attack, plant xylanase inhibitor proteins (XIPs) that inhibit fungal xylanase activity are believed to act as a defensive barrier against fungal pathogens. To understand the role of XIPs in rice, a xylanase inhibitor was cloned from rice. The expression of this gene was examined at the transcriptional/translational levels during compatible and incompatible interactions, and the biochemical activity of this protein was also examined.

RESULTS: Sequence alignment revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of OsCLP shares a high degree of similarity with that of other plant TAXI-type XIPs. However, recombinant OsCLP did not display inhibitory activity against endo-1,4-β-xylanase enzymes from Aureobasidium pullulans (A. pullulans) or Trichoderma viride (T. viride). Instead, an in-gel activity assay revealed strong chitinase activity. The transcription and translation of OsCLP were highly induced when rice was exposed to pathogens in an incompatible interaction. In addition, exogenous treatment with OsCLP affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall. These data suggest that OsCLP, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsCLP may have antifungal activity. This protein may directly inhibit pathogen growth by degrading fungal cell wall components through chitinase activity.
23460823	Analysis of proteome profile in germinating soybean seed, and its comparison with rice showing the styles of reserves mobilization in different crops.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Seed germination is a complex physiological process during which mobilization of nutrient reserves happens. In different crops, this event might be mediated by different regulatory and metabolic pathways. Proteome profiling has been proved to be an efficient way that can help us to construct these pathways. However, no such studies have been performed in soybean germinating seeds up to date.

RESULTS: Proteome profiling was conducted through one-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry strategy in the germinating seeds of soybean (glycine max). Comprehensive comparisons were also carried out between rice and soybean germinating seeds. 764 proteins belonging to 14 functional groups were identified and metabolism related proteins were the largest group. Deep analyses of the proteins and pathways showed that lipids were degraded through lipoxygenase dependent pathway and proteins were degraded through both protease and 26S proteosome system, and the lipoxygenase could also help to remove the reactive oxygen species during the rapid mobilization of reserves of soybean germinating seeds. The differences between rice and soybean germinating seeds proteome profiles indicate that each crop species has distinct mechanism for reserves mobilization during germination. Different reserves could be converted into starches before they are totally utilized during the germination in different crops seeds.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first comprehensive analysis of proteome profile in germinating soybean seeds to date. The data presented in this paper will improve our understanding of the physiological and biochemical status in the imbibed soybean seeds just prior to germination. Comparison of the protein profile with that of germinating rice seeds gives us new insights on mobilization of nutrient reserves during the germination of crops seeds.
23314754	STIFDB2: an updated version of plant stress-responsive transcription factor database with additional stress signals, stress-responsive transcription factor binding sites and stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Understanding the principles of abiotic and biotic stress responses, tolerance and adaptation remains important in plant physiology research to develop better varieties of crop plants. Better understanding of plant stress response mechanisms and application of knowledge derived from integrated experimental and bioinformatics approaches are gaining importance. Earlier, we showed that compiling a database of stress-responsive transcription factors and their corresponding target binding sites in the form of Hidden Markov models at promoter, untranslated and upstream regions of stress-up-regulated genes from expression analysis can help in elucidating various aspects of the stress response in Arabidopsis. In addition to the extensive content in the first version, STIFDB2 is now updated with 15 stress signals, 31 transcription factors and 5,984 stress-responsive genes from three species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica and Oryza sativa subsp. indica). We have employed an integrated biocuration and genomic data mining approach to characterize the data set of transcription factors and consensus binding sites from literature mining and stress-responsive genes from the Gene Expression Omnibus. STIFDB2 currently has 38,798 associations of stress signals, stress-responsive genes and transcription factor binding sites predicted using the Stress-responsive Transcription Factor (STIF) algorithm, along with various functional annotation data. As a unique plant stress regulatory genomics data platform, STIFDB2 can be utilized for targeted as well as high-throughput experimental and computational studies to unravel principles of the stress regulome in dicots and gramineae. STIFDB2 is available from the URL: http://caps.ncbs.res.in/stifdb2.
23194343	Brassinosteroids suppress rice defense against root-knot nematodes through antagonism with the jasmonate pathway.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The importance of phytohormone balance is increasingly recognized as central to the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. Next to their well-known developmental role, brassinosteroids (BR) were recently found to be involved in plant innate immunity. In this study, we examined the role of BR in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity during infection with the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola, and we studied the inter-relationship with the jasmonate (JA) pathway. Exogenous epibrassinolide (BL) supply at low concentrations induced susceptibility in the roots whereas high concentrations of BL enforced systemic defense against this nematode. Upon high exogenous BL supply on the shoot, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed a strong feedback inhibitory effect, leading to reduced BR biosynthesis in the root. Moreover, we demonstrate that the immune suppressive effect of BR is at least partly due to negative cross-talk with the JA pathway. Mutants in the BR biosynthesis or signaling pathway accumulate slightly higher levels of the immediate JA-precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, and qRT-PCR data showed that the BR and JA pathway are mutually antagonistic in rice roots. Collectively, these results suggest that the balance between the BR and JA pathway is an effective regulator of the outcome of the rice-M. graminicola interaction.
23333961	Genetic variability of oxalate oxidase activity and elongation in water-stressed primary roots of diverse maize and rice lines.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	A previous study of maize primary roots under water stress showed pronounced increases in oxalate oxidase activity and apoplastic hydrogen peroxide in the apical region of the growth zone where cell elongation is maintained. We examined whether increased oxalate oxidase activity in water-stressed roots is conserved across diverse lines of maize and rice. The maize lines exhibited varied patterns of activity, with some lines lacking activity in the apical region. Moreover, none of the rice lines showed activity in the apical region. Also, although the genotypic response of root elongation to water stress was variable in both maize and rice, this was not correlated with the pattern of oxalate oxidase activity. Implications of these findings for root growth regulation under water stress are discussed.
23361014	The evolution and pathogenic mechanisms of the rice sheath blight pathogen.	2013	Nat Commun	Rhizoctonia solani is a major fungal pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that causes great yield losses in all rice-growing regions of the world. Here we report the draft genome sequence of the rice sheath blight disease pathogen, R. solani AG1 IA, assembled using next-generation Illumina Genome Analyser sequencing technologies. The genome encodes a large and diverse set of secreted proteins, enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and transporters, which probably reflect an exclusive necrotrophic lifestyle. We find few repetitive elements, a closer relationship to Agaricomycotina among Basidiomycetes, and expand protein domains and families. Among the 25 candidate pathogen effectors identified according to their functionality and evolution, we validate 3 that trigger crop defence responses; hence we reveal the exclusive expression patterns of the pathogenic determinants during host infection.
23602094	SLL1, which encodes a member of the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family, is involved in cell elongation in lateral roots via regulation of fatty acid content in rice.	2013	Plant Sci	We have identified a gene, SHORT LATERAL ROOT LENGTH1 (SLL1), which is important for the elongation of lateral roots in rice. An sll1 mutant has decreased lateral root growth due to a defect in the cell elongation. The SLL1 gene encodes a member of the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family that is the key regulator of overall fatty acid desaturation in plants. We measured the fatty acid content and found that the 18:0 content in the sll1 mutant root was approximately 4 times that in the wild-type root. When the sll1 mutant was grown at 33 °C, it complemented the mutant phenotype to a moderate level, which reflects the importance of the low 18:0 content in maintaining the cell membrane structure. The SLL1 gene was expressed at the lateral root tip, whereas SLL1 expression was not detected in the elongation zone of the crown roots. These results indicate that the lateral root specific defect in sll1 mutant is caused by the different expression patterns of SLL1 in lateral and crown roots. In addition, SLL1 over-expressers produced significantly longer lateral roots compared to the wild-type, and thus SLL1 gene would be very useful for improving rice root architecture.
23442150	qDTY12.1: a locus with a consistent effect on grain yield under drought in rice.	2013	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Selection for grain yield under drought is an efficient criterion for improving the drought tolerance of rice. Recently, some drought-tolerant rice varieties have been developed using this selection criterion and successfully released for cultivation in drought-prone target environments. The process can be made more efficient and rapid through marker-assisted breeding, a well-known fast-track approach in crop improvement. QTLs have been identified for grain yield under drought with large effects against drought-susceptible varieties. Most of the identified QTLs show large QTL × environment or QTL × genetic background interactions. The development of mapping populations in the background of popular high-yielding varieties, screening across environments, including the target environments, and the identification of QTLs with a consistent effect across environments can be a suitable alternative marker-assisted breeding strategy. An IR74371-46-1-1 × Sabitri backcross inbred line population was screened for reproductive-stage drought stress at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines, and Regional Agricultural Research Station, Nepalgunj, Nepal, in the dry and wet seasons of 2011, respectively. A bulk segregant analysis approach was used to identify markers associated with high grain yield under drought.

RESULTS: A QTL, qDTY12.1, significantly associated with grain yield under reproductive-stage drought stress was identified on chromosome 12 with a consistent effect in two environments: IRRI, Philippines, and RARS, Nepalgunj, Nepal. This QTL explained phenotypic variance of 23.8% and contributed an additive effect of 45.3% for grain yield under drought. The positive QTL allele for qDTY12.1 was contributed by tolerant parent IR74371-46-1-1.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, qDTY12.1 showed a consistent effect across environments for high grain yield under lowland reproductive-stage drought stress in the background of popular high-yielding but drought-susceptible recipient variety Sabitri. qDTY12.1 was also reported previously [Crop Sci 47:507-516, 2007] to increase grain yield under upland reproductive-stage drought stress situations. qDTY12.1 is the only QTL reported so far in rice to have shown a large effect against multiple recipient genetic backgrounds as well as under highly diverse upland and lowland rice ecosystems. qDTY12.1 can be successfully introgressed to improve grain yield under drought of popular high-yielding but drought-susceptible lowland as well as upland adapted varieties following marker-assisted breeding.
23625520	A novel translocation event leads to a recombinant stable chromosome with interrupted centromeric domains in rice.	2013	Chromosoma	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) centromeres are composed of 155-bp satellite repeats (CentO), centromere-specific retrotransposon (CRR), and a variety of other repeats. Previous studies have shown that CentO and CRR elements are both parts of the functional centromere/kinetochore complex. In this study, a naturally occurring karyotype rearrangement involving a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 11 in an indica rice Zhongxian 3037 has been identified. The recombinant centromere in Chr11L·9L has two CentO tandem arrays, separated by a long array of 5S rDNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunostaining showed that centromere-specific histone H3 (cenH3) variant was bound to the two flanking CentO arrays, but not to the 5S rDNAs residing between the CentO repeats. No obvious difference was detected in H3K4me2 and H3K9ac modification of the 5S rDNAs between the wild type and the mutant. Therefore, the translocation results in a recombinant stable chromosome with interrupted centromeric domains. A lack of cenH3 binding in 5S rDNA sequences residing within the centromeric core suggests that not all centromeric sequences confer centromere identity in rice.
23621326	GIANT EMBRYO encodes CYP78A13, required for proper size balance between embryo and endosperm in rice.	2013	Plant J	Among angiosperms there is a high degree of variation in embryo/endosperm size in mature seeds. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying size control between these neighboring tissues. Here we report the rice GIANT EMBRYO (GE) gene that is essential for controlling the size balance. The function of GE in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm. GE, which encodes CYP78A13, is predominantly expressed in the interfacing tissues of the both embryo and endosperm. GE expression is under negative feedback regulation; endogenous GE expression is upregulated in ge mutants. In contrast to the loss-of-function mutant with large embryo and small endosperm, GE overexpression causes a small embryo and enlarged endosperm. A complementation analysis coupled with heterofertilization showed that complementation of ge mutation in either embryo or endosperm failed to restore the wild-type embryo/endosperm ratio. Thus, embryo and endosperm interact in determining embryo/endosperm size balance. Among genes associated with embryo/endosperm size, REDUCED EMBRYO genes, whose loss-of-function causes a phenotype opposite to ge, are revealed to regulate endosperm size upstream of GE. To fully understand the embryo-endosperm size control, the genetic network of the related genes should be elucidated.
23627500	Identification of a novel microRNA (miRNA) from rice that targets an alternatively spliced transcript of the Nramp6 (Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6) gene involved in pathogen resistance.	2013	New Phytol	Plants have evolved efficient defence mechanisms to defend themselves from pathogen attack. Although many studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of defence responses, less is known about the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in plant immunity. This work investigates miRNAs that are regulated by elicitors from the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice (Oryza sativa). Small RNA libraries were constructed from rice tissues and subjected to high-throughput sequencing for the identification of elicitor-responsive miRNAs. Target gene expression was examined by microarray analysis. Transgenic lines were used for the analysis of miRNA functioning in disease resistance. Elicitor treatment is accompanied by dynamic alterations in the expression of a significant number of miRNAs, including new members of annotated miRNAs. Novel miRNAs from rice are proposed. We report a new rice miRNA, osa-miR7695, which negatively regulates an alternatively spliced transcript of OsNramp6 (Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6). This novel miRNA experienced natural and domestication selection events during evolution, and its overexpression in rice confers pathogen resistance. This study highlights an miRNA-mediated regulation of OsNramp6 in disease resistance, whilst illustrating the existence of a novel regulatory network that integrates miRNA function and mRNA processing in plant immunity.
23589608	Roles of plant hormones and their interplay in rice immunity.	2013	Mol Plant	Plant hormones have been extensively studied for their importance in innate immunity particularly in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, only in the last decade, plant hormones were demonstrated to play conserved and divergent roles in fine-tuning immune in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocotyledonous model crop plant. Emerging evidence showed that salicylic acid (SA) plays a role in rice basal defense but is differentially required by rice pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and resistance (R) protein-mediated immunity, and its function is likely dependent on the signaling pathway rather than the change of endogenous levels. Jasmonate (JA) plays an important role in rice basal defense against bacterial and fungal infection and may be involved in the SA-mediated resistance. Ethylene (ET) can act as a positive or negative modulator of disease resistance, depending on the pathogen type and environmental conditions. Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and abscisic acid (ABA) either promote or defend against infection of pathogens with distinct infection/colonization strategies. Auxin and gibberellin (GA) are generally thought of as negative regulators of innate immunity in rice. Moreover, GA interacts antagonistically with JA signaling in rice development and immunity through the DELLA protein as a master regulator of the two hormone pathways. In this review, we summarize the roles of plant hormones in rice immunity and discuss their interplay/crosstalk mechanisms and the complex regulatory network of plant hormone pathways in fine-tuning rice immunity and growth.
23548780	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture.	2013	Plant Physiol	Chloroplast biogenesis has been well documented in higher plants, yet the complex methods used to regulate chloroplast activity under fluctuating environmental conditions are not well understood. In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression. Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering. Coexpression, microarray, and real-time expression analyses demonstrate a correlation between Cga1 expression and the expression of important nucleus-encoded, chloroplast-localized genes. Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling. Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index. These results indicate a conserved mechanism by which Cga1 regulates chloroplast development in higher plants.
23578473	Plant phenomics and high-throughput phenotyping: accelerating rice functional genomics using multidisciplinary technologies.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	The functional analysis of the rice genome has entered into a high-throughput stage, and a project named RICE2020 has been proposed to determine the function of every gene in the rice genome by the year 2020. However, as compared with the robustness of genetic techniques, the evaluation of rice phenotypic traits is still performed manually, and the process is subjective, inefficient, destructive and error-prone. To overcome these limitations and help rice phenomics more closely parallel rice genomics, reliable, automatic, multifunctional, and high-throughput phenotyping platforms should be developed. In this article, we discuss the key plant phenotyping technologies, particularly photonics-based technologies, and then introduce their current applications in rice (wheat or barley) phenomics. We also note the major challenges in rice phenomics and are confident that these reliable high-throughput phenotyping tools will give plant scientists new perspectives on the information encoded in the rice genome.
23597919	Expression of neutral β-glucosidase from Scytalidium thermophilum in Candida glabrata for ethanol production from alkaline-pretreated rice straw.	2013	J Biosci Bioeng	We successfully expressed the neutral β-glucosidase (BGL4) from Scytalidium thermophilum in the thermotolerant yeast Candida glabrata. Compared to the strain expressing Aspergillus acidic β-glucosidase (BGL1), the BGL4-expressing strain showed a higher cellobiose fermentation ability at pH 6.0 and 40°C, leading to a higher ethanol production from alkaline-pretreated rice straw.
22930426	Regulation of ATG6/Beclin-1 homologs by abiotic stresses and hormones in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Genet Mol Res	Autophagy, a complex and conserved mechanism, serving as a defense response in all eukaryotic organisms, is regulated by several proteins, among which ATG proteins are the most important due to their involvement in autophagosome formation. ATG6/Beclin-1 proteins, reported to be essential for autophagosome formation and assigned as a conserved domain, were subjected to database searches. We found three homologs in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. A phylogeny tree was constructed to establish their across species relationship, which divided them into three distinct groups; two for plants, i.e., monocots and dicots, and one for animals. Evolutionary study of this family by critical amino acid conservation analysis revealed significant functional divergence. The finding of important stress-related cis-acting elements in the promoter region of rice ATG6 genes demonstrated their involvement in abiotic stress responses. Furthermore, expression profiling of rice ATG6 genes based on microarray data, as well as by semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed differential expression when subjected to different stresses suggesting the involvement of OsATG6 genes in abiotic stresses (heat, cold and drought) and hormone (abscisic acid) responses. Analysis of co-expressed genes showed that most of them annotated to DNA repair pathways and proteolysis, etc. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of OsATG6 genes in different stresses, and provide a basis for further functional studies to investigate the biological mechanism of action of these genes under abiotic stresses.
23278238	Indeterminate domain 10 regulates ammonium-mediated gene expression in rice roots.	2013	New Phytol	Indeterminate domain (IDD) genes are a family of plant transcriptional regulators that function in the control of development and metabolism during growth. Here, the function of Oryza sativa indeterminate domain 10 (OsIDD10) has been explored in rice plants. Compared with wild-type roots, idd10 mutant roots are hypersensitive to exogenous ammonium. This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism. The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors. Molecular studies and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify target genes and IDD10 binding cis-elements. IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2. IDD10 contributes significantly to the induction of several genes involved in N-linked metabolic and cellular responses, including genes encoding glutamine synthetase 2, nitrite reductases and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase. Furthermore, the possibility that IDD10 might influence the N-mediated feedback regulation of target genes was examined. This study demonstrates that IDD10 is involved in regulatory circuits that determine N-mediated gene expression in plant roots.
23233223	Overexpression of OsDPR, a novel rice gene highly expressed under iron deficiency, suppresses plant growth.	2012	Sci China Life Sci	Preliminary microarray analysis of cDNA from rice roots revealed an up-regulated transcript that was highly expressed in a five-day iron deficiency treatment. The entire sequence of this gene was determined by bioinformatics analysis. There were no proteins with significant levels of similarity detected in public databases. This novel gene with unknown biological function was designated as OsDPR (dwarf phenotype-related gene). We constructed a stable plant expression vector pCAMBIA1302-OsDPR::GFP and produced transgenic tobacco plants. The phenotypes suggested that OsDPR restrained the growth of transformed plants. To understand the mechanisms of this suppression effect, cell size and number were compared between transformants and wild-type plants. The cell proliferation rate was lower in OsDPR transgenic BY-2 cells than in wild-type cells, but OsDPR expression did not affect cell size. Moreover, the cell division-related gene CyclinD2.1, which is involved in plant growth, was down-regulated in transgenic tobacco plants. These findings suggested that the novel iron-regulated gene OsDPR is responsible for the nanism phenotype of transgenic seedlings because of the inhibition of plant cell proliferation.
23264228	Functional analysis of Hsp70 superfamily proteins of rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Cell Stress Chaperones	Heat stress results in misfolding and aggregation of cellular proteins. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) enable the cells to maintain proper folding of proteins, both in unstressed as well as stressed conditions. Hsp70 genes encode for a group of highly conserved chaperone proteins across the living systems encompassing bacteria, plants, and animals. In the cellular chaperone network, Hsp70 family proteins interconnect other chaperones and play a dominant role in various cell processes. To assess the functionality of rice Hsp70 genes, rice genome database was analyzed. Rice genome contains 32 Hsp70 genes. Rice Hsp70 superfamily genes are represented by 24 Hsp70 family and 8 Hsp110 family members. Promoter and transcript expression analysis divulges that Hsp70 superfamily genes plays important role in heat stress. Ssc1 (mitochondrial Hsp70 protein in yeast) deleted yeast show compromised growth at 37 °C. Three mitochondrial rice Hsp70 sequences (i.e., mtHsp70-1, mtHsp70-2, and mtHsp70-3) complemented the Ssc1 mutation of yeast to differential extents. The information presented in this study provides detailed understanding of the Hsp70 protein family of rice, the crop species that is the major food for the world population.
23341965	Methyl fluoride affects methanogenesis rather than community composition of methanogenic archaea in a rice field soil.	2013	PLoS One	The metabolic pathways of methane formation vary with environmental conditions, but whether this can also be linked to changes in the active archaeal community structure remains uncertain. Here, we show that the suppression of aceticlastic methanogenesis by methyl fluoride (CH(3)F) caused surprisingly little differences in community composition of active methanogenic archaea from a rice field soil. By measuring the natural abundances of carbon isotopes we found that the effective dose for a 90% inhibition of aceticlastic methanogenesis in anoxic paddy soil incubations was <0.75% CH(3)F (v/v). The construction of clone libraries as well as t-RFLP analysis revealed that the active community, as indicated by mcrA transcripts (encoding the α subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme for methanogenesis), remained stable over a wide range of CH(3)F concentrations and represented only a subset of the methanogenic community. More precisely, Methanocellaceae were of minor importance, but Methanosarcinaceae dominated the active population, even when CH(3)F inhibition only allowed for aceticlastic methanogenesis. In addition, we detected mcrA gene fragments of a so far unrecognised phylogenetic cluster. Transcription of this phylotype at methyl fluoride concentrations suppressing aceticlastic methanogenesis suggests that the respective organisms perform hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Hence, the application of CH(3)F combined with transcript analysis is not only a useful tool to measure and assign in situ acetate usage, but also to explore substrate usage by as yet uncultivated methanogens.
23319183	Characterization of a novel glutelin subunit OsGluBX by the experimental approach and molecular dynamics simulations.	2013	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Rice glutelin is a multi-subunit storage protein and has high nutritional value. However, many glutelin subunits are still not identified by experiment approach. In this study, a novel subunit (OsGluBX) was discovered by sequence alignment in the UniProtKB database. And then, the OsGluBX of rice from japonica cv. Nipponbare and indica cv. 9311 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli system and further identified by Western blotting. The total storage proteins were extracted from the grains of Nipponbare and 9311, and the native OsGluBX were identified. The novel OsGluBX subunit was classified into the subfamily B based on its high homology to the subfamily B members and their immunoblotting identification against the subfamily-specific antibody. Furthermore, two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis showed similarity and difference of the entire glutelin profiles between the two subspecies. Moreover, the atomic coordinate of the OsGluBX was constructed based on homology modeling approach and refined by molecular dynamics simulations. The spatial conformation of the OsGluBX protein was stable during the simulation, and the obvious hydrogen bonds were observed to maintain the integrity and stability of the β-sheets region of the OsGluBX. Research into this novel OsGluBX subunit has improved our understanding of the glutelin family in rice.
23294545	Homologous expression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase increases grain yield and tolerance of transgenic rice plants to environmental stresses.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Various environmental stresses induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing deleterious effects on plant cells. Glutathione (GSH), a critical antioxidant, is used to combat ROS. GSH is produced by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) and glutathione synthetase (GS). To evaluate the functional roles of the Oryza sativa L. Japonica cv. Ilmi ECS (OsECS) gene, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsECS under the control of an inducible promoter (Rab21). When grown under saline conditions (100mM) for 4 weeks, 2-independent transgenic (TGR1 and TGR2) rice plants remained bright green in comparison to control wild-type (WT) rice plants. TGR1 and TGR2 rice plants also showed a higher GSH/GSSG ratio than did WT rice plants in the presence of 100mM NaCl, which led to enhanced redox homeostasis. TGR1 and TGR2 rice plants also showed lower ion leakage and higher chlorophyll-fluorescence when exposed to 10μM methyl viologen (MV). Furthermore, the TGR1 and TGR2 rice seeds had approximately 1.5-fold higher germination rates in the presence of 200mM salt. Under paddy field conditions, OsECS-overexpression in transgenic rice plants increased rice grain yield (TGW) and improved biomass. Overall, our results show that OsECS overexpression in transgenic rice increases tolerance and germination rate in the presence of abiotic stress by improving redox homeostasis via an enhanced GSH pool. Our findings suggest that increases in grain yield by OsECS overexpression could improve crop yields under natural environmental conditions.
23338673	Molecular cloning and evolutionary analysis of the HOG-signaling pathway genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae rice wine isolates.	2013	Biochem Genet	The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway is crucial for yeast to cope with high osmolarity. Here, we showed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae rice wine isolates exhibited higher tolerance to osmotic stress, which was associated with the evolution of HOG pathway genes. Phylogenetic analysis of HOG genes revealed that Chinese rice wine strains were closely related to sake strains, indicating a common origin of rice wine strains. The DNA sequence diversity analysis showed that higher levels of polymorphism tended to accumulate on the osmosensor genes (MSB2 and SLN1), suggesting that most changes in a signaling transduction pathway were concentrated in the receptors. Moreover, the rapid evolution of osmosensors (Sln1/Msb2) and transcription factor (Msn4) might experience positive selection. Our results imply that the evolution of HOG pathway genes in S. cerevisiae rice wine strains is associated with their adaptation to high osmotic environments.
23386293	Virus-induced gene silencing for rice using agroinoculation.	2013	Methods Mol Biol	Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a reverse genetics technique that is based on the RNA-mediated defense against viruses in plants. VIGS is a method of gene knockdown triggered by a replicating viral nucleic acid engineered to carry a host gene to be silenced. While there are a number of excellent VIGS vectors available for dicots, only a few are available for monocots. Here, we describe the detailed method of the use of a newly developed VIGS vector for rice, based on the rice-infecting Rice tungro bacilliform virus, a pararetrovirus with dsDNA genome. Using a method based on Agrobacterium-mediated injection of the VIGS construct at the meristematic region of young rice plants, silencing of target genes can be achieved and the silenced phenotype can be visualized in 3 weeks.
23613738	Identification of transcriptome SNPs for assessing allele-specific gene expression in a super-hybrid rice Xieyou9308.	2013	PLoS One	Hybridization, a common process in nature, can give rise to a vast reservoir of allelic variants. Combination of these allelic variants may result in novel patterns of gene action and is thought to contribute to heterosis. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide allele-specific gene expression (ASGE) in the super-hybrid rice variety Xieyou9308 using RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq). We identified 9325 reliable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the genome. Nearly 68% of the identified polymorphisms were CT and GA SNPs between R9308 and Xieqingzao B, suggesting the existence of DNA methylation, a heritable epigenetic mark, in the parents and their F1 hybrid. Of 2793 identified transcripts with consistent allelic biases, only 480 (17%) showed significant allelic biases during tillering and/or heading stages, implying that trans effects may mediate most transcriptional differences in hybrid offspring. Approximately 67% and 62% of the 480 transcripts showed R9308 allelic expression biases at tillering and heading stages, respectively. Transcripts with higher levels of gene expression in R9308 also exhibited R9308 allelic biases in the hybrid. In addition, 125 transcripts were identified with significant allelic expression biases at both stages, of which 74% showed R9308 allelic expression biases. R9308 alleles may tend to preserve their characteristic states of activity in the hybrid and may play important roles in hybrid vigor at both stages. The allelic expression of 355 transcripts was highly stage-specific, with divergent allelic expression patterns observed at different developmental stages. Many transcripts associated with stress resistance were differently regulated in the F1 hybrid. The results of this study may provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms of heterosis.
23531043	Enhanced transgene expression in rice following selection controlled by weak promoters.	2013	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Techniques that enable high levels of transgene expression in plants are attractive for the commercial production of plant-made recombinant pharmaceutical proteins or other gene transfer related strategies. The conventional way to increase the yield of desired transgenic products is to use strong promoters to control the expression of the transgene. Although many such promoters have been identified and characterized, the increase obtainable from a single promoter is ultimately limited to a certain extent.

RESULTS: In this study, we report a method to magnify the effect of a single promoter by using a weak promoter-based selection system in transgenic rice. tCUP1, a fragment derived from the tobacco cryptic promoter (tCUP), was tested for its activity in rice by fusion to both a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter and a hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) selectable marker. The tCUP1 promoter allowed the recovery of transformed rice plants and conferred tissue specific expression of the GUS reporter, but was much weaker than the CaMV 35S promoter in driving a selectable marker for growth of resistant calli. However, in the resistant calli and regenerated transgenic plants selected by the use of tCUP1, the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was dramatically increased as a result of the additive effect of multiple T-DNA insertions. The correlation between attenuated selection by a weak promoter and elevation of copy number and foreign gene expression was confirmed by using another relatively weak promoter from nopaline synthase (Nos).

CONCLUSIONS: The use of weak promoter derived selectable markers leads to a high T-DNA copy number and then greatly increases the expression of the foreign gene. The method described here provides an effective approach to robustly enhance the expression of heterogenous transgenes through copy number manipulation in rice.
23430047	Rice MtN3/saliva/SWEET family genes and their homologs in cellular organisms.	2013	Mol Plant	The MtN3/saliva/SWEET-type genes, existing either alone or in a family group, are found in diverse organisms, from monocellular protozoa to higher eukaryotes, indicating their importance in cellular organisms. These genes encode polytopic membrane proteins that feature an MtN3/saliva domain, also known as a PQ loop repeat. The rice MtN3/saliva/SWEET gene family consists of 21 members and is among the largest families in sequenced organisms. Accumulating data suggest that these genes are involved in multiple physiological processes, including reproductive development, senescence, environmental adaptation, and host-pathogen interaction, in different species. In rice, some members of the family, including Xa13/Os8N3/OsSWEET11, which is essential for reproductive development, are used by the pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae to invade its host. Emerging data have also revealed that at least some MtN3/saliva/SWEET-type proteins may regulate different physiological processes by facilitating ion transport via interaction with ion transporters or as sugar transporters. The accumulating knowledge about MtN3/saliva/SWEET-type genes will help to elucidate the molecular bases of their function in different organisms.
23613580	Imprinted expression of genes and small RNA is associated with localized hypomethylation of the maternal genome in rice endosperm.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm, a transient tissue that nourishes the embryo, exhibits extensive localized DNA demethylation on maternally inherited chromosomes. Demethylation mediates parent-of-origin-specific (imprinted) gene expression but is apparently unnecessary for the extensive accumulation of maternally biased small RNA (sRNA) molecules detected in seeds. Endosperm DNA in the distantly related monocots rice and maize is likewise locally hypomethylated, but whether this hypomethylation is generally parent-of-origin specific is unknown. Imprinted expression of sRNA also remains uninvestigated in monocot seeds. Here, we report high-coverage sequencing of the Kitaake rice cultivar that enabled us to show that localized hypomethylation in rice endosperm occurs solely on the maternal genome, preferring regions of high DNA accessibility. Maternally expressed imprinted genes are enriched for hypomethylation at putative promoter regions and transcriptional termini and paternally expressed genes at promoters and gene bodies, mirroring our recent results in A. thaliana. However, unlike in A. thaliana, rice endosperm sRNA populations are dominated by specific strong sRNA-producing loci, and imprinted 24-nt sRNAs are expressed from both parental genomes and correlate with hypomethylation. Overlaps between imprinted sRNA loci and imprinted genes expressed from opposite alleles suggest that sRNAs may regulate genomic imprinting. Whereas sRNAs in seedling tissues primarily originate from small class II (cut-and-paste) transposable elements, those in endosperm are more uniformly derived, including sequences from other transposon classes, as well as genic and intergenic regions. Our data indicate that the endosperm exhibits a unique pattern of sRNA expression and suggest that localized hypomethylation of maternal endosperm DNA is conserved in flowering plants.
23613199	Functional conservation of MIKC*-Type MADS box genes in Arabidopsis and rice pollen maturation.	2013	Plant Cell	There are two groups of MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal (MIKC)-type MADS box genes, MIKC(C) type and MIKC* type. In seed plants, the MIKC(C) type shows considerable diversity, but the MIKC* type has only two subgroups, P- and S-clade, which show conserved expression in the gametophyte. To examine the functional conservation of MIKC*-type genes, we characterized all three rice (Oryza sativa) MIKC*-type genes. All three genes are specifically expressed late in pollen development. The single knockdown or knockout lines, respectively, of the S-clade MADS62 and MADS63 did not show a mutant phenotype, but lines in which both S-clade genes were affected showed severe defects in pollen maturation and germination, as did knockdown lines of MADS68, the only P-clade gene in rice. The rice MIKC*-type proteins form strong heterodimeric complexes solely with partners from the other subclade; these complexes specifically bind to N10-type C-A-rich-G-boxes in vitro and regulate downstream gene expression by binding to N10-type promoter motifs. The rice MIKC* genes have a much lower degree of functional redundancy than the Arabidopsis thaliana MIKC* genes. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the function of heterodimeric MIKC*-type protein complexes in pollen development has been conserved since the divergence of monocots and eudicots, roughly 150 million years ago.
23034647	A map of rice genome variation reveals the origin of cultivated rice.	2012	Nature	Crop domestications are long-term selection experiments that have greatly advanced human civilization. The domestication of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) ranks as one of the most important developments in history. However, its origins and domestication processes are controversial and have long been debated. Here we generate genome sequences from 446 geographically diverse accessions of the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon, the immediate ancestral progenitor of cultivated rice, and from 1,083 cultivated indica and japonica varieties to construct a comprehensive map of rice genome variation. In the search for signatures of selection, we identify 55 selective sweeps that have occurred during domestication. In-depth analyses of the domestication sweeps and genome-wide patterns reveal that Oryza sativa japonica rice was first domesticated from a specific population of O. rufipogon around the middle area of the Pearl River in southern China, and that Oryza sativa indica rice was subsequently developed from crosses between japonica rice and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread into South East and South Asia. The domestication-associated traits are analysed through high-resolution genetic mapping. This study provides an important resource for rice breeding and an effective genomics approach for crop domestication research.
23201415	Identification of the highly accumulated microRNA*s in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Gene	Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for the regulation of gene expression, which is involved in almost all the important biological processes. In the cytoplasm, the miRNA strand is selectively incorporated into a specific Argonaute (AGO)-associated gene silencing complex, while the miRNA* is degraded rapidly. Thus, most miRNA*s were thought to be biologically meaningless. Interestingly, several recent reports in both plants and animals have shaken this notion. Many miRNA*s were demonstrated to possess regulatory roles in gene expression. However, the low accumulation levels of most miRNA*s raise the question whether the activities of this small RNA (sRNA) species are widespread in plants. Here, by using publicly available sRNA high-throughput sequencing data, we found that the accumulation levels of several miRNA*s could be much higher than those of their miRNA partners in certain organs, mutants and/or AGO-associated silencing complexes of both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Based on target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, some of these highly accumulated miRNA*s were indicated to possess cleavage-based potential regulatory role on certain targets. Besides, some interesting biological interpretations were obtained based on the accumulation patterns of the miRNA*s, the annotations of the target genes, and literature mining. Taken together, the expanded list of the highly accumulated miRNA*s along with their potential target genes discovered in this study further strengthened the current notion that certain members of the miRNA* species are biologically relevant, which needs further inspection.
23362379	Genotypic recognition and spatial responses by rice roots.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Root system growth and development is highly plastic and is influenced by the surrounding environment. Roots frequently grow in heterogeneous environments that include interactions from neighboring plants and physical impediments in the rhizosphere. To investigate how planting density and physical objects affect root system growth, we grew rice in a transparent gel system in close proximity with another plant or a physical object. Root systems were imaged and reconstructed in three dimensions. Root-root interaction strength was calculated using quantitative metrics that characterize the extent to which the reconstructed root systems overlap each other. Surprisingly, we found the overlap of root systems of the same genotype was significantly higher than that of root systems of different genotypes. Root systems of the same genotype tended to grow toward each other but those of different genotypes appeared to avoid each other. Shoot separation experiments excluded the possibility of aerial interactions, suggesting root communication. Staggered plantings indicated that interactions likely occur at root tips in close proximity. Recognition of obstacles also occurred through root tips, but through physical contact in a size-dependent manner. These results indicate that root systems use two different forms of communication to recognize objects and alter root architecture: root-root recognition, possibly mediated through root exudates, and root-object recognition mediated by physical contact at the root tips. This finding suggests that root tips act as local sensors that integrate rhizosphere information into global root architectural changes.
23619785	A battle between genomes in plant male fertility.	2013	Nat Genet	Analyses of a new male sterility gene from a well-known rice cytoplasmic sterile line reveal inhibition of a nucleus-encoded protein and counteractions by nuclear fertility restorer factors. The existence of these genes in wild rice populations suggests that they may confer selective advantages.
23580618	3D phenotyping and quantitative trait locus mapping identify core regions of the rice genome controlling root architecture.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Identification of genes that control root system architecture in crop plants requires innovations that enable high-throughput and accurate measurements of root system architecture through time. We demonstrate the ability of a semiautomated 3D in vivo imaging and digital phenotyping pipeline to interrogate the quantitative genetic basis of root system growth in a rice biparental mapping population, Bala × Azucena. We phenotyped >1,400 3D root models and >57,000 2D images for a suite of 25 traits that quantified the distribution, shape, extent of exploration, and the intrinsic size of root networks at days 12, 14, and 16 of growth in a gellan gum medium. From these data we identified 89 quantitative trait loci, some of which correspond to those found previously in soil-grown plants, and provide evidence for genetic tradeoffs in root growth allocations, such as between the extent and thoroughness of exploration. We also developed a multivariate method for generating and mapping central root architecture phenotypes and used it to identify five major quantitative trait loci (r(2) = 24-37%), two of which were not identified by our univariate analysis. Our imaging and analytical platform provides a means to identify genes with high potential for improving root traits and agronomic qualities of crops.
18060440	Serpins in plants and green algae.	2008	Funct Integr Genomics	Control of proteolysis is important for plant growth, development, responses to stress, and defence against insects and pathogens. Members of the serpin protein family are likely to play a critical role in this control through irreversible inhibition of endogenous and exogenous target proteinases. Serpins have been found in diverse species of the plant kingdom and represent a distinct clade among serpins in multicellular organisms. Serpins are also found in green algae, but the evolutionary relationship between these serpins and those of plants remains unknown. Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of mammalian serine proteinases of the chymotrypsin family in vitro but, intriguingly, plants and green algae lack endogenous members of this proteinase family, the most common targets for animal serpins. An Arabidopsis serpin with a conserved reactive centre is now known to be capable of inhibiting an endogenous cysteine proteinase. Here, knowledge of plant serpins in terms of sequence diversity, inhibitory specificity, gene expression and function is reviewed. This was advanced through a phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of expressed plant serpins, delineation of plant serpin gene structures and prediction of inhibitory specificities based on identification of reactive centres. The review is intended to encourage elucidation of plant serpin functions.
18540109	The common function of a novel subfamily of B-Box zinc finger proteins with reference to circadian-associated events in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Over 1,600 genes encoding putative transcription factors have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence, however, their physiological functions are not yet fully understood. In this study, a small subfamily of double B-box zinc finger (DBB, DOUBLE B-BOX) genes, encoding eight putative transcription factors, were characterized with reference to the circadian rhythm and the early photomorphogenic regulation of hypocotyl elongation in response to light signals. Among these, it was found that the transcriptions of five DBB genes were under the control of circadian rhythm. To gain insight into the physiological roles of these putative transcription factors, forward and reverse genetic studies were carried out. The results suggested that they are commonly implicated in light signal transduction during early photomorphogenesis, however, their functions are not totally redundant, as judged by the fact that their circadian-expression profiles (or phases) were distinctive from each other, and by the fact that some DBBs (named DBB1a, DBB1b, STO, and STH) were apparently implicated in light signal transduction in a negative manner, whereas another (named DBB3) was implicated in a positive manner with regard to light-induced inhibition of elongation of hypocotyls. We also found that homologous B-box zinc finger genes are widely conserved in higher plants (e.g., Oryza sativa). Taking this altogether, it is probable that in addition to previously characterized bZIP-type transcription factors (e.g., HY5 and HYH) and bHLH-type transcription factors (e.g., PIF4 and PIF5/PIL6), a set of B-box zinc finger transcription factors should also be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the early photomorphogenic development of Arabidopsis thaliana.
15055541	Molecular characterization of a pathogenesis-related protein 8 gene encoding a class III chitinase in rice.	2004	Mol Cells	A cDNA encoding a class III chitinase (Oschib1) was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from rice leaves infected with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 861 nucleotides encoding 286 amino acid residues with a pI of 5.06. The deduced amino acid sequence of Oschibl has a high level of similarity with class IIIb chitinases of Gladiolus gandavensis (46%) and Tulipa bakeri (49%). A high level of Oschibl mRNA was detected after inoculation with M. grisea or Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Expression of Oschib1 was induced more rapidly when an avirulent strain of M. grisea was inoculated (incompatible interaction) than when a virulent strain was used (compatible interaction). Expression of Oschibl was also induced by treatment of signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonic acid, and by treatment with H2O2 or CuSO4. The induction patterns of Oschibl expression suggest that Oschib1 may be involved in defense response against pathogen infections and may be classified as a member of pathogenesis-related protein 8 in rice.
12466527	Analysis of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase families of Arabidopsis thaliana suggests functional diversification of chromatin modification among multicellular eukaryotes.	2002	Nucleic Acids Res	Sequence similarity and profile searching tools were used to analyze the genome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster for genes encoding three families of histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins and three families of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) proteins. Plants, animals and fungi were found to have a single member of each of three subfamilies of the GNAT family of HATs, suggesting conservation of these functions. However, major differences were found with respect to sizes of gene families and multi-domain protein structures within other families of HATs and HDACs, indicating substantial evolutionary diversification. Phylogenetic analysis identified a new class of HDACs within the RPD3/HDA1 family that is represented only in plants and animals. A similar analysis of the plant-specific HD2 family of HDACs suggests a duplication event early in dicot evolution, followed by further diversification in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis. Of three major classes of SIR2-type HDACs that are found in animals, fungi have representatives only in one class, whereas plants have representatives only in the other two. Plants possess five CREB-binding protein (CBP)-type HATs compared with one to two in animals and none in fungi. Domain and phylogenetic analyses of the CBP family proteins showed that this family has evolved three distinct types of CBPs in plants. The domain architecture of CBP and TAF(II)250 families of HATs show significant differences between plants and animals, most notably with respect to bromodomain occurrence and their number. Bromodomain-containing proteins in Arabidopsis differ strikingly from animal bromodomain proteins with respect to the numbers of bromodomains and the other types of domains that are present. The substantial diversification of HATs and HDACs that has occurred since the divergence of plants, animals and fungi suggests a surprising degree of evolutionary plasticity and functional diversification in these core chromatin components.
17379695	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice microarray analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA). The gene designated as AK073843 which is homologous to class capital SHA, Cyrillic chitinase was found to exhibit the highest induction among these genes. However, its crucial residues within the chitinase active site are substituted with other residues, suggesting that the protein has no chitinase activity. The recombinant protein which is encoded by the AK073843 gene produced in Escherichia coli has xylanase inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor protein (OsXIP). The expression of OsXIP was enhanced not only by exogenous AsA treatment but also by various stresses such as citrate and sodium chloride treatments, and wounding; however, it was not influenced by increasing endogenous AsA content. External AsA treatment caused a significant increase in electrolyte leakage from rice root. These results suggested that OsXIP was induced by stress which is caused by external AsA treatment. Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression. Also, these genes were differentially induced by stress and stress-related phytohormones. The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root. RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones. Thus, XIP-type xylanase inhibitors were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in rice.
15794761	Emergence of a subfamily of xylanase inhibitors within glycoside hydrolase family 18.	2005	FEBS J	The xylanase inhibitor protein I (XIP-I), recently identified in wheat, inhibits xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 10 (GH10) and 11 (GH11). Sequence and structural similarities indicate that XIP-I is related to chitinases of family GH18, despite its lack of enzymatic activity. Here we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a XIP-type inhibitor from rice. Despite its initial classification as a chitinase, the rice inhibitor does not exhibit chitinolytic activity but shows specificities towards fungal GH11 xylanases similar to that of its wheat counterpart. This, together, with an analysis of approximately 150 plant members of glycosidase family GH18 provides compelling evidence that xylanase inhibitors are largely represented in this family, and that this novel function has recently emerged based on a common scaffold. The plurifunctionality of GH18 members has major implications for genomic annotations and predicted gene function. This study provides new information which will lead to a better understanding of the biological significance of a number of GH18 'inactivated' chitinases.
22267741	Identification of grass-specific enzyme that acylates monolignols with p-coumarate.	2012	J Biol Chem	Lignin is a major component of plant cell walls that is essential to their function. However, the strong bonds that bind the various subunits of lignin, and its cross-linking with other plant cell wall polymers, make it one of the most important factors in the recalcitrance of plant cell walls against polysaccharide utilization. Plants make lignin from a variety of monolignols including p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols to produce the three primary lignin units: p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl, respectively, when incorporated into the lignin polymer. In grasses, these monolignols can be enzymatically preacylated by p-coumarates prior to their incorporation into lignin, and these monolignol conjugates can also be "monomer" precursors of lignin. Although monolignol p-coumarate-derived units may comprise up to 40% of the lignin in some grass tissues, the p-coumarate moiety from such conjugates does not enter into the radical coupling (polymerization) reactions of lignification. With a greater understanding of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates, grass lignins could be engineered to contain fewer pendent p-coumarate groups and more monolignol conjugates that improve lignin cleavage. We have cloned and expressed an enzyme from rice that has p-coumarate monolignol transferase activity and determined its kinetic parameters.
12834401	Molecular characterization of the Arabidopsis 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene family.	2003	Plant J	A key regulated step in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis in plants is catalyzed by 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which cleaves 9-cis xanthophylls to xanthoxin, a precursor of ABA. In Arabidopsis, ABA biosynthesis is controlled by a small family of NCED genes. Nine carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) genes have been identified in the complete genome sequence. Of these, five AtNCEDs (2, 3, 5, 6, and 9) have been cloned and studied for expression and subcellular localization. Although all five AtNCEDs are targeted to plastids, they differ in binding activity of the thylakoid membrane. AtNCED2, AtNCED3, and AtNCED6 are found in both stroma and thylakoid membrane-bound compartments. AtNCED5 is exclusively bound to thylakoids, whereas AtNCED9 remains soluble in stroma. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis and histochemical staining of promoter::GUS activity in transgenic Arabidopsis revealed a complex pattern of localized NCED expression in well-watered plants during development. AtNCED2 and AtNCED3 account for the NCED activity in roots, with localized expression in root tips, pericycle, and cortex cells at the base of lateral roots. Localized AtNCED2 and AtNCED3 expression in pericycle cells is an early marker of lateral initiation sites. AtNCED5, AtNCED6, AtNCED3, and AtNCED2 are expressed in flowers with very high AtNCED6::GUS activity occurring in pollen. AtNCED5::GUS, and to lesser degrees, AtNCED2::GUS and AtNCED3::GUS are expressed in developing anthers. AtNCED5, AtNCED6, AtNCED9, and AtNCED3 contribute to expression in developing seeds with high levels of AtNCED6 present at an early stage. GUS analysis indicates that AtNCED3 expression is confined to the base of the seed, whereas AtNCED5 and AtNCED6 are expressed throughout the seed. Consistent with the studies conducted by Iuchi and his colleagues in 2001, AtNCED3 is the major stress-induced NCED in leaves. Our results indicate that developmental control of ABA synthesis involves localized patterns of AtNCED gene expression. In addition, differential membrane-binding capacity of AtNCEDs is a potential means of post-translational regulation of NCED activity.
15817418	The PIN auxin efflux facilitators: evolutionary and functional perspectives.	2005	Trends Plant Sci	It is widely believed that the PIN proteins are crucial for proper cellular coordination. Since the analysis of the Arabidopsis pin-formed mutant in 1991, and the subsequent cloning of AtPIN1, a further seven members of the family have been discovered. Here, we present an overview of this family of auxin efflux facilitators in monocot and dicot plants, summarizing their evolutionary history, expression profiles and, where appropriate, relating them to protein function.
16844839	ZmPIN1a and ZmPIN1b encode two novel putative candidates for polar auxin transport and plant architecture determination of maize.	2006	Plant Physiol	Shoot apical meristems produce organs in a highly stereotypic pattern that involves auxin. Auxin is supposed to be actively transported from cell to cell by influx (AUXIN/LIKE AUXIN proteins) and efflux (PIN-FORMED proteins) membrane carriers. Current hypotheses propose that, at the meristem surface, PIN proteins create patterns of auxin gradients that, in turn, create patterns of gene expression and morphogenesis. These hypotheses are entirely based on work in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To verify whether these models also apply to other species, we studied the behavior of PIN proteins during maize (Zea mays) development. We identified two novel putative orthologs of AtPIN1 in maize and analyzed their expression pattern during development. The expression studies were complemented by immunolocalization studies using an anti-AtPIN1 antibody. Interestingly, the maize proteins visualized by this antibody are almost exclusively localized in subepidermal meristematic layers. Both tassel and ear were characterized by a compact group of cells, just below the surface, carrying PIN. In contrast to or to complement what was shown in Arabidopsis, these results point to the importance of internally localized cells in the patterning process. We chose the barren inflorescence2 (bif2) maize mutant to study the role of auxin polar fluxes in inflorescence development. In severe alleles of bif2, the tassel and the ear present altered ZmPIN1a and ZmPIN1b protein expression and localization patterns. In particular, the compact groups of cells in the tassel and ear of the mutant were missing. We conclude that BIF2 is important for PIN organization and could play a role in the establishment of polar auxin fluxes in maize inflorescence, indirectly modulating the process of axillary meristem formation and development.
20528920	Expression profile of PIN, AUX/LAX and PGP auxin transporter gene families in Sorghum bicolor under phytohormone and abiotic stress.	2010	FEBS J	Auxin is transported by the influx carriers auxin resistant 1/like aux1 (AUX/LAX), and the efflux carriers pin-formed (PIN) and P-glycoprotein (PGP), which play a major role in polar auxin transport. Several auxin transporter genes have been characterized in dicotyledonous Arabidopsis, but most are unknown in monocotyledons, especially in sorghum. Here, we analyze the chromosome distribution, gene duplication and intron/exon of SbPIN, SbLAX and SbPGP gene families, and examine their phylogenic relationships in Arabidopsis, rice and sorghum. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that most of these genes were differently expressed in the organs of sorghum. SbPIN3 and SbPIN9 were highly expressed in flowers, SbLAX2 and SbPGP17 were mainly expressed in stems, and SbPGP7 was strongly expressed in roots. This suggests that individual genes might participate in specific organ development. The expression profiles of these gene families were analyzed after treatment with: (a) the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and brassinosteroid; (b) the polar auxin transport inhibitors 1-naphthoxyacetic acids, 1-naphthylphthalamic acid and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid; and (c) abscissic acid and the abiotic stresses of high salinity and drought. Most of the auxin transporter genes were strongly induced by indole-3-acetic acid and brassinosteroid, providing new evidence for the synergism of these phytohormones. Interestingly, most genes showed similar trends in expression under polar auxin transport inhibitors and each also responded to abscissic acid, salt and drought. This study provides new insights into the auxin transporters of sorghum.
19947981	AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3 are master transcription factors that cooperatively regulate ABRE-dependent ABA signaling involved in drought stress tolerance and require ABA for full activation.	2010	Plant J	A myriad of drought stress-inducible genes have been reported, and many of these are activated by abscisic acid (ABA). In the promoter regions of such ABA-regulated genes, conserved cis-elements, designated ABA-responsive elements (ABREs), control gene expression via bZIP-type AREB/ABF transcription factors. Although all three members of the AREB/ABF subfamily, AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3, are upregulated by ABA and water stress, it remains unclear whether these are functional homologs. Here, we report that all three AREB/ABF transcription factors require ABA for full activation, can form hetero- or homodimers to function in nuclei, and can interact with SRK2D/SnRK2.2, an SnRK2 protein kinase that was identified as a regulator of AREB1. Along with the tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes and the subcellular localization of their encoded proteins, these findings clearly indicate that AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3 have largely overlapping functions. To elucidate the role of these AREB/ABF transcription factors, we generated an areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant. Large-scale transcriptome analysis, which showed that stress-responsive gene expression is remarkably impaired in the triple mutant, revealed novel AREB/ABF downstream genes in response to water stress, including many LEA class and group-Ab PP2C genes and transcription factors. The areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant is more resistant to ABA than are the other single and double mutants with respect to primary root growth, and it displays reduced drought tolerance. Thus, these results indicate that AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3 are master transcription factors that cooperatively regulate ABRE-dependent gene expression for ABA signaling under conditions of water stress.
16598073	'Evidence of an auxin signal pathway, microRNA167-ARF8-GH3, and its response to exogenous auxin in cultured rice cells'.	2006	Nucleic Acids Res	MicroRNA167 (miR167) was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 (ARF8) mRNA in cultured rice cells. MiR167 level was found to be controlled by the presence of auxin in the growth medium. When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of ARF8 mRNA. Cells growing in the normal growth medium containing auxin showed a reversed trend. It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by ARF8. Delivery of synthesized miR167 into cells led to decrease of both ARF8 mRNA and OsGH3-2 mRNA. This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and ARF8 in sequence. This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses.
12101121	MicroRNAs in plants.	2002	Genes Dev	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of ~22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs thought to regulate gene expression in metazoans. We find that miRNAs are also present in plants, indicating that this class of noncoding RNA arose early in eukaryotic evolution. In this paper 16 Arabidopsis miRNAs are described, many of which have differential expression patterns in development. Eight are absolutely conserved in the rice genome. The plant miRNA loci potentially encode stem-loop precursors similar to those processed by Dicer (a ribonuclease III) in animals. Mutation of an Arabidopsis Dicer homolog, CARPEL FACTORY, prevents the accumulation of miRNAs, showing that similar mechanisms direct miRNA processing in plants and animals. The previously described roles of CARPEL FACTORY in the development of Arabidopsis embryos, leaves, and floral meristems suggest that the miRNAs could play regulatory roles in the development of plants as well as animals.
12202040	Prediction of plant microRNA targets.	2002	Cell	We predict regulatory targets for 14 Arabidopsis microRNAs (miRNAs) by identifying mRNAs with near complementarity. Complementary sites within predicted targets are conserved in rice. Of the 49 predicted targets, 34 are members of transcription factor gene families involved in developmental patterning or cell differentiation. The near-perfect complementarity between plant miRNAs and their targets suggests that many plant miRNAs act similarly to small interfering RNAs and direct mRNA cleavage. The targeting of developmental transcription factors suggests that many plant miRNAs function during cellular differentiation to clear key regulatory transcripts from daughter cell lineages.
15856348	The auxin-responsive GH3 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2006	Funct Integr Genomics	Auxin regulates plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the genes of Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 classes have been extensively studied in dicots, but little information is available on monocots. We have identified 12 members of GH3 gene family in rice using sequences of full-length cDNA clones available from KOME and analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice. The genomic organization as well as chromosomal location of all the OsGH3 genes is reported. The rice GH3 proteins can be classified in two groups (groups I and II) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis GH3 proteins. Based upon the sequences available in the database, not a single group III GH3 protein could be identified in rice. An extensive survey of EST sequences of other monocots led to the conclusion that although GH3 gene family is highly conserved in both dicots and monocots but the group III is conspicuous by its absence in monocots. The in silico analysis has been complemented with experimental data to quantify transcript levels of all GH3 gene family members. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the organ-specific expression of individual OsGH3 genes in light- and dark-grown seedlings/plants has been examined. The transcript abundance of nearly all OsGH3 genes is enhanced on auxin treatment, with the effect more pronounced on OsGH3-1, -2, and -4. The functional validation of these genes in transgenics or analysis of gene-specific insertional mutants will help in elucidating their precise role in auxin signal transduction.
20129631	Cytosolic APx knockdown indicates an ambiguous redox responses in rice.	2010	Phytochemistry	Ascorbate peroxidases (APX, EC 1.1.11.1) are class I heme-peroxidases, which catalyze the conversion of H(2)O(2) into H(2)O, using ascorbate as a specific electron donor. Previously, the presence of eight Apx genes was identified in the nuclear genome of rice (Oryza sativa), encoding isoforms that are located in different sub-cellular compartments. Herein, the generation of rice transgenic plants silenced for either both or each one of the cytosolic Apx1 and Apx2 genes was carried out in order to investigate the importance of cytosolic Apx isoforms on plant development and on plant stress responses. Transgenic double Apx1/2-silenced plants exhibited normal development, even though these plants showed a global reduction of Apx activity which strongly impacts the whole antioxidant system regulation. Apx1/2-silenced plants also showed increased H(2)O(2) accumulation under control and stress situations and presented higher tolerance to toxic concentration of aluminum when compared to wild type plants. On the other hand, silencing OsApx1 and OsApx2 genes individually resulted in strong effect on plant development producing semi-dwarf phenotype. These results suggested that the double silencing of cytosolic OsApx genes induced compensatory antioxidant mechanisms in rice while single knockdown of these genes did not, which resulted in the impairing of normal plant development.
20644566	Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar.	2010	Cell Res	As an important agronomic trait, inclination of leaves is crucial for crop architecture and grain yields. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling rice leaf angles, one rice leaf inclination2 (lc2, three alleles) mutant was identified and functionally characterized. Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint. The LC2 gene was isolated through positional cloning, and encodes a vernalization insensitive 3-like protein. Complementary expression of LC2 reversed the enlarged leaf angles of lc2 plants, confirming its role in controlling leaf inclination. LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids. LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects.
12582522	Cloning of cDNA for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and the expression of mRNA in rice endosperm.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Rice endosperm UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) cDNA clones were isolated by screening a lambda ZAP II library prepared from poly (A(+)) RNA of japonica rice (cv Sasanishiki) endosperm with a probe of potato UGPase cDNA. One cDNA clone, possessing about 1,700 nucleotides, contained the complete open reading frame of rice UGPase. At the nucleotide-sequence level, the UGPase cDNA of rice endosperm had high homology with the UGPase cDNA of barley endosperm (84%) and potato tuber (71%). The calculated molecular weight (50 kDa) agrees with the value determined by SDS-PAGE (51 kDa). At the amino-acid sequence level, rice UGPase has high homology with the UGPase of barley (92%) and potato (85%). The enzyme contained conserved sequence elements which are thought to be involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. A Southern-blot analysis indicated that the gene existed as a single copy. Expression of the enzyme in rice endosperm examined by Northern-blot analysis was high at 10-15 days after heading.
9435140	Hormonal regulation of expression of two cysteine endopeptidase genes in rice seedlings.	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	Two cDNA probes (pRP60 and pRP80) were used to examine the hormonal regulation of expression of two cysteine endopeptidase genes in germinated whole seeds and de-embryonated seeds of rice. The pRP60 protein is a major rice cysteine endopeptidase named REP-1 that digests rice glutelin, the main seed storage protein. The pRP80 protein has features of a cysteine endopeptidase but has not yet been confirmed to be one. Neither mRNA was detectable in dry seeds, and the levels per seed increased sharply upon imbibition, reached peaks at d 6 to d 9, and then decreased. Both mRNAs were expressed in a seed-specific manner, but the accumulation of pRP60 mRNA was about ten times greater than the other. When seeds were de-embryonated and incubated, the amounts of both mRNAs were reduced to very low levels, but in the presence of 0.01 to 1 microM gibberellic acid (GA3) both again reached high levels. Addition of abscisic acid (ABA) or uniconazole, an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, partly eliminated the effect of GA3. Protein immunoblot analysis showed that the accumulation of the REP-1 protein in seeds was regulated by GA3 and ABA similarly to that of pRP60 mRNA, but the change in pRP60 mRNA with time after the onset of imbibition preceded that of the REP-1 protein.
15549374	Molecular analysis of the CRINKLY4 gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2005	Planta	The maize (Zea mays L.) CRINKLY4 (CR4) gene encodes a serine/threonine receptor-like kinase that controls an array of developmental processes in the plant and endosperm. The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. genome encodes an ortholog of CR4, ACR4, and four CRINKLY4-RELATED (CRR) proteins: AtCRR1, AtCRR2, AtCRR3 and AtCRK1. The available genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa L.) encodes a CR4 ortholog, OsCR4, and four CRR proteins: OsCRR1, OsCRR2, OsCRR3 and OsCRR4, not necessarily orthologous to the Arabidopsis CRRs. A phylogenetic study showed that AtCRR1 and AtCRR2 form a clade closest to the CR4 group while all the other CRRs form a separate cluster. The five Arabidopsis genes are differentially expressed in various tissues. A construct formed by fusion of the ACR4 promoter and the GUS reporter, ACR4::GUS, is expressed primarily in developing tissues of the shoot. The ACR4 cytoplasmic domain functions in vitro as a serine/threonine kinase, while the AtCRR1 and AtCRR2 kinases are not active. The ability of ACR4 to phosphorylate AtCRR2 suggests that they might function in the same signal transduction pathway. T-DNA insertions were obtained in ACR4, AtCRR1, AtCRR2, AtCRR3 and AtCRK1. Mutations in acr4 show a phenotype restricted to the integuments and seed coat, suggesting that Arabidopsis might contain a redundant function that is lacking in maize. The lack of obvious mutant phenotypes in the crr mutants indicates they are not required for the hypothetical redundant function.
15619004	The plant thioredoxin system.	2005	Cell Mol Life Sci	Thioredoxins are small proteins catalyzing thiol-disulfide interchange and are involved in the regulation of the redox environment of the cell. In plants, the thioredoxin system is particularly complex since at least 20 thioredoxin isoforms are found in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. Based upon primary sequence analysis and subcellular localization, thioredoxins can be classified into different groups and subgroups. Different pathways allowing thioredoxin reduction also coexist in the plant involving ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin reductases and the glutathione/glutaredoxin system. This review discusses the literature of plant thioredoxins with emphasis on recent findings in the field.
9599802	Rice phloem thioredoxin h has the capacity to mediate its own cell-to-cell transport through plasmodesmata.	1998	Planta	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) phloem sieve tubes contain RPP13-1, a thioredoxin h protein that moves around the plant via the translocation stream. Such phloem-mobile proteins are thought to be synthesized in the companion cells prior to being transferred, through plasmodesmata, to the enucleate sieve-tube members. In this study, in-situ hybridization experiments confirmed that expression of RPP13-1 is restricted to companion cells within the mature phloem. To test the hypothesis that RPP13-1 enters the sieve tube, via plasmodesmata, recombinant RPP13-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, extracted, purified and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for use in microinjection experiments into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) mesophyll cells. The FITC-RPP13-1 moved from the injected cell into surrounding cells, whereas the E. coli thioredoxin, an evolutionary homolog of RPP13-1, when similarly labeled and injected, failed to move in this same experimental system. In addition, co-injection of RPP13-1 and FITC-dextrans established that RPP13-1 can induce an increase in plasmodesmal size exclusion limit to a value greater than 9.4 but less than 20 kDa. Nine mutant forms of RPP13-1 were constructed and tested for their capacity to move from cell to cell; two such mutants were found to be incapable of movement. Crystal-structure prediction studies were performed on wild-type and mutant RPP13-1 to identify the location of structural motifs required for protein trafficking through plasmodesmata. These studies are discussed with respect to plasmodesmal-mediated transport of macromolecules within the companion cell-sieve tube complex.
16170456	Phylogenomic analysis of the PEBP gene family in cereals.	2005	J Mol Evol	The TFL1 and FT genes, which are key genes in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, belong to a small multigene family characterized by a specific phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein domain, termed the PEBP gene family. Several PEBP genes are found in dicots and monocots, and act on the control of flowering time. We investigated the evolution of the PEBP gene family in cereals. First, taking advantage of the complete rice genome sequence and EST databases, we found 19 PEBP genes in this species, 6 of which were not previously described. Ten genes correspond to five pairs of paralogs mapped on known duplicated regions of the rice genome. Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice genes indicates that the PEBP gene family consists of three main homology classes (the so-called TFL1-LIKE, MFT-LIKE, and FT-LIKE subfamilies), in which gene duplication and/or loss occurred independently in Arabidopsis and rice. Second, phylogenetic analyses of genomic and EST sequences from five cereal species indicate that the three subfamilies of PEBP genes have been conserved in cereals. The tree structure suggests that the ancestral grass genome had at least two MFT-like genes, two TFL1-like genes, and eight FT-like genes. A phylogenomic approach leads to some hypotheses about conservation of gene function within the subfamilies.
15247399	Contrasting modes of diversification in the Aux/IAA and ARF gene families.	2004	Plant Physiol	The complete genomic sequence for Arabidopsis provides the opportunity to combine phylogenetic and genomic approaches to study the evolution of gene families in plants. The Aux/IAA and ARF gene families, consisting of 29 and 23 loci in Arabidopsis, respectively, encode proteins that interact to mediate auxin responses and regulate various aspects of plant morphological development. We developed scenarios for the genomic proliferation of the Aux/IAA and ARF families by combining phylogenetic analysis with information on the relationship between each locus and the previously identified duplicated genomic segments in Arabidopsis. This analysis shows that both gene families date back at least to the origin of land plants and that the major Aux/IAA and ARF lineages originated before the monocot-eudicot divergence. We found that the extant Aux/IAA loci arose primarily through segmental duplication events, in sharp contrast to the ARF family and to the general pattern of gene family proliferation in Arabidopsis. Possible explanations for the unusual mode of Aux/IAA duplication include evolutionary constraints imposed by complex interactions among proteins and pathways, or the presence of long-distance cis-regulatory sequences. The antiquity of the two gene families and the unusual mode of Aux/IAA diversification have a number of potential implications for understanding both the functional and evolutionary roles of these genes.
19665012	The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice.	2009	Dev Biol	The adaxial-abaxial axis in leaf primordia is thought to be established first and is necessary for the expansion of the leaf lamina along the mediolateral axis. To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves. adl1 leaves are covered with bulliform-like cells, which are normally distributed only on the adaxial surface. An adl1 double mutant with the adaxially snowy leaf mutant, which has albino cells that specifically appear in the abaxial mesophyll tissue, indicated that adl1 leaves show adaxialization in both epidermal and mesophyll tissues. The expression of HD-ZIPIII genes in adl1 mutant increased in mature leaves, but not in the young primordia or the SAM. This indicated that ADL1 may not be directly involved in determining initial leaf polarity, but rather is associated with the maintenance of axis information. ADL1 encodes a plant-specific calpain-like cysteine proteinase orthologous to maize DEFECTIVE KERNEL1. Furthermore, we identified intermediate and strong alleles of the adl1 mutant that generate shootless embryos and globular-arrested embryos with aleurone layer loss, respectively. We propose that ADL1 plays an important role in pattern formation of the leaf and embryo by promoting proper epidermal development.
20331531	Analysis of ER stress in developing rice endosperm accumulating beta-amyloid peptide.	2010	Plant Biotechnol J	The common neurodegenerative disorder known as Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cerebral neuritic plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Plaque formation is related to the highly aggregative property of this peptide, because it polymerizes to form insoluble plaques or fibrils causing neurotoxicity. Here, we expressed Abeta peptide as a new causing agent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to study ER stress occurred in plant. When the dimer of Abeta(1-42) peptide was expressed in maturing seed under the control of the 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 promoter containing its signal peptide, a maximum of about 8 mug peptide per grain accumulated and was deposited at the periphery of distorted ER-derived PB-I protein bodies. Synthesis of Abeta peptide in the ER lumen severely inhibited the synthesis and deposition of seed storage proteins, resulting in the generation of many small and abnormally appearing PB bodies. This ultrastructural change was accounted for by ER stress leading to the accumulation of aggregated Abeta peptide in the ER lumen and a coordinated increase in ER-resident molecular chaperones such as BiPs and PDIs in Abeta-expressing plants. Microarray analysis also confirmed that expression of several BiPs, PDIs and OsbZIP60 containing putative transmembrane domains was affected by the ER stress response. Abeta-expressing transgenic rice kernels exhibited an opaque and shrunken phenotype. When grain phenotype and expression levels were compared among transgenic rice grains expressing several different recombinant peptides, such detrimental effects on grain phenotype were correlated with the expressed peptide causing ER stress rather than expression levels.
20532512	Characterization of five polyamine oxidase isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2010	Plant Cell Rep	The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains five genes (AtPAO1 to AtPAO5) encoding polyamine oxidase (PAO) which is an enzyme responsible for polyamine catabolism. To understand the individual roles of the five AtPAOs, here we characterized their tissue-specific and space-temporal expression. AtPAO1 seems to have a specific function in flower organ. AtPAO2 was expressed in shoot meristem and root tip of seedlings, and to a higher extent in the later growth stage within restricted parts of the organs, such as shoot meristem, leaf petiole and also in anther. The expression of AtPAO3 was constitutive, but highest in flower organ. AtPAO3 promoter activity was detected in cotyledon, distal portion of root, boundary region of mature rosette leaf and in filaments of flower. AtPAO4 was expressed at higher level all over young seedlings including roots, and in the mature stage its expression was ubiquitous with rather lower level in stem. AtPAO5 expression was observed in the whole plant body throughout various growth stages. Its highest expression was in flowers, particularly in sepals, but not in petals. Furthermore, we determined the substrate specificity of AtPAO1 to AtPAO4. None of the AtPAO enzymes recognized putrescine (Put). AtPAO2 and AtPAO3 showed almost similar substrate recognition patterns in which the most preferable substrate is spermidine (Spd) followed by less specificity to other tetraamines tested. AtPAO4 seemed to be spermine (Spm)-specific. More interestingly, AtPAO1 preferred thermospermine (T-Spm) and norspermine (NorSpm) to Spm, but did not recognize Spd. Based on the results, the individual function of AtPAOs is discussed.
20561251	Functional characterization of the SIZ/PIAS-type SUMO E3 ligases, OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Environ	Sumoylation is a post-translational regulatory process in diverse cellular processes in eukaryotes, involving conjugation/deconjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to other proteins thus modifying their function. The PIAS [protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)] and SAP (scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS)/MIZ (SIZ) proteins exhibit SUMO E3-ligase activity that facilitates the conjugation of SUMO proteins to target substrates. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2 (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1. The rice SIZ proteins are localized to the nucleus and showed sumoylation activities in a tobacco system. Our analysis showed increased amounts of SUMO conjugates associated with environmental stresses such as high and low temperature, NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice plants. The expression of OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates under heat shock conditions. In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2. The results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway. Their effects on the Arabidopsis mutant suggest a function for these genes related to stress responses and stress adaptation.
20193128	Response and transcriptional regulation of rice SUMOylation system during development and stress conditions.	2010	BMB Rep	Modification of proteins by the reversible covalent addition of the small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) protein has important consequences affecting target protein stability, sub-cellular localization, and protein-protein interactions. SUMOylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions, which resembles the process of ubiquitination. In this study, we characterized the SUMOylation system from an important crop plant, rice, and show that it responds to cold, salt and ABA stress conditions on a protein level via the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins. We also characterized the transcriptional regulation of individual SUMOylation cascade components during stress and development. During stress conditions, majority of the SUMO cascade components are transcriptionally down regulated. SUMO conjugate proteins and SUMO cascade component transcripts accumulated differentially in various tissues during plant development with highest levels in reproductive tissues. Taken together, these data suggest a role for SUMOylation in rice development and stress responses.
18299247	Plant ABC proteins--a unified nomenclature and updated inventory.	2008	Trends Plant Sci	The ABC superfamily comprises both membrane-bound transporters and soluble proteins involved in a broad range of processes, many of which are of considerable agricultural, biotechnological and medical potential. Completion of the Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences has revealed a particularly large and diverse complement of plant ABC proteins in comparison with other organisms. Forward and reverse genetics, together with heterologous expression, have uncovered many novel roles for plant ABC proteins, but this progress has been accompanied by a confusing proliferation of names for plant ABC genes and their products. A consolidated nomenclature will provide much-needed clarity and a framework for future research.
20140455	Gain of deleterious function causes an autoimmune response and Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility in rice.	2010	Mol Genet Genomics	Reproductive isolation plays an important role in speciation as it restricts gene flow and accelerates genetic divergence between formerly interbreeding population. In rice, hybrid breakdown is a common reproductive isolation observed in both intra and inter-specific crosses. It is a type of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in which sterility and weakness are manifested in the F(2) and later generations. In this study, the physiological and molecular basis of hybrid breakdown caused by two recessive genes, hbd2 and hbd3, in a cross between japonica variety, Koshihikari, and indica variety, Habataki, were investigated. Fine mapping of hbd2 resulted in the identification of the causal gene as casein kinase I (CKI1). Further analysis revealed that hbd2-CKI1 allele gains its deleterious function that causes the weakness phenotype by a change of one amino acid. As for the other gene, hbd3 was mapped to the NBS-LRR gene cluster region. It is the most common class of R-gene that triggers the immune signal in response to pathogen attack. Expression analysis of pathogen response marker genes suggested that weakness phenotype in this hybrid breakdown can be attributed to an autoimmune response. So far, this is the first evidence linking autoimmune response to post-zygotic isolation in rice. This finding provides a new insight in understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms establishing post-zygotic isolation in plants.
14529272	Rice C2-domain proteins are induced and translocated to the plasma membrane in response to a fungal elicitor.	2003	Biochemistry	Hundreds of proteins involved in signaling pathways contain a Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-binding motif called the C2-domain. However, no small C2-domain proteins consisting of a single C2-domain have been reported in animal cells. We have isolated two cDNA clones, OsERG1a and OsERG1b, that encode two small C2-domain proteins of 156 and 159 amino acids, respectively, from a fungal elicitor-treated rice cDNA library. The clones are believed to have originated from a single gene by alternative splicing. Transcript levels of the OsERG1 gene are dramatically elevated by a fungal elicitor prepared from Magnaporthe grisea or by Ca(2+) ions. The OsERG1 protein produced in Escherichia coli binds to phospholipid vesicles in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and is translocated to the plasma membrane of plant cells by treatment with either a fungal elicitor or a Ca(2+) ionophore. These results suggest that OsERG1 proteins containing a single C2-domain are involved in plant defense signaling systems.
17196101	Analysis of rice glycosyl hydrolase family 1 and expression of Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase.	2006	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores, activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling. Plant GH1 beta-glucosidases are encoded by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant GH1 members, their expression and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice.

RESULTS: Forty GH1 genes could be identified in rice databases, including 2 possible endophyte genes, 2 likely pseudogenes, 2 gene fragments, and 34 apparently competent rice glycosidase genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GH1 members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are often clustered together on the same chromosome. Most of the genes appear to have been derived from duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common ancestor, and the two plants share only 8 common gene lineages. At least 31 GH1 genes are expressed in a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cDNA and EST sequences in public databases. The cDNA of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings. A thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently hydrolyzed beta-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucose residues and laminaribiose.

CONCLUSION: Careful analysis of the database sequences produced more reliable rice GH1 gene structure and protein product predictions. Since most of these genes diverged after the divergence of the ancestors of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, only a few of their functions could be implied from those of GH1 enzymes from Arabidopsis and other dicots. This implies that analysis of GH1 enzymes in monocots is necessary to understand their function in the major grain crops. To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
3286638	The NH2-terminal 21 amino acid residues are not essential for the papain-inhibitory activity of oryzacystatin, a member of the cystatin superfamily. Expression of oryzacystatin cDNA and its truncated fragments in Escherichia coli.	1988	J Biol Chem	Oryzacystatin, a proteinaceous cysteine proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) in rice, is comprised of 102 residues (Met1-Ala102) (Abe, K., Emori, Y., Kondo, H., Suzuki, K., and Arai, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16793-16797). We constructed an expression plasmid containing a full length oryzacystatin cDNA at the multi-cloning site of pUC18 and produced a lacZ'-oryzacystatin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The partially purified expressed protein efficiently inhibits papain activity assayed using N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide as a substrate. We also constructed expression plasmids lacking the 5'- and 3'-regions of cDNAs that encode NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatins. An N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking Gly5 and retaining Gln53-Val54-Val55-Ala56-Gly57 inhibited papain as efficiently as the full length oryzacystatin, although both Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57 (oryzacystatin numbering) are conserved among members of most cystatin superfamilies. However, another N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking the NH2-terminal 38 residues was almost completely inactive. On the other hand, a COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking the COOH-terminal 11 residues possesses potent papain-inhibitory activity, whereas another COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking 35 residues shows much less inhibitory activity, although it retains the two well conserved features Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal 21 residues containing Gly5 and the COOH-terminal 11 residues are not essential, suggesting that a portion of the polypeptide segment containing Gln53-Gly57 is necessary for oryzacystatin to elicite its papain-inhibitory activity efficiently.
15073216	Molecular characterization of OsRAD21-1, a rice homologue of yeast RAD21 essential for mitotic chromosome cohesion.	2004	J Exp Bot	Rad21/Rec8 is an important component and key regulator of cohesins. A RAD21-like gene from rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) has been cloned and termed OsRAD21-1. OsRAD21-1 is a single-copy gene in the rice genome and is expressed in the entire plant. OsRad21-1 consists of 1055 amino acid residues and is the largest of the Rad21/Rec8 family identified to date. Based on sequence similarity comparison with other members of this family and gene expression patterns, it is concluded that OsRad21 is a rice orthologue of yeast Rad21.
21119003	PAIR3, an axis-associated protein, is essential for the recruitment of recombination elements onto meiotic chromosomes in rice.	2011	Mol Biol Cell	During meiosis, the paired homologous chromosomes are tightly held together by the synaptonemal complex (SC). This complex consists of two parallel axial/lateral elements (AEs/LEs) and one central element. Here, we observed that PAIR3 localized to the chromosome core during prophase I and associated with both unsynapsed AEs and synapsed LEs. Analyses of the severe pair3 mutant demonstrated that PAIR3 was essential for bouquet formation, homologous pairing and normal recombination, and SC assembly. In addition, we showed that although PAIR3 was not required for the initial recruitment of PAIR2, it was required for the proper association of PAIR2 with chromosomes. Dual immunostaining revealed that PAIR3 highly colocalized with REC8. Moreover, studies using a rec8 mutant indicated that PAIR3 localized to chromosomes in a REC8-dependent manner.
19001369	Six classes of nuclear localization signals specific to different binding grooves of importin alpha.	2009	J Biol Chem	The importin alpha/beta pathway mediates nuclear import of proteins containing the classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Although the consensus sequences of the classical NLSs have been defined, there are still many NLSs that do not match the consensus rule and many nonfunctional sequences that match the consensus. We report here six different NLS classes that specifically bind to distinct binding pockets of importin alpha. By screening of random peptide libraries using an mRNA display, we selected peptides bound by importin alpha and identified six classes of NLSs, including three novel classes. Two noncanonical classes (class 3 and class 4) specifically bound the minor binding pocket of importin alpha, whereas the classical monopartite NLSs (class 1 and class 2) bound to the major binding pocket. Using a newly developed universal green fluorescent protein expression system, we found that these NLS classes, including plant-specific class 5 NLSs and bipartite NLSs, fundamentally require the regions outside the core basic residues for their activity and have specific residues or patterns that confer the activities differently between yeast, plants, and mammals. Furthermore, amino acid replacement analyses revealed that the consensus basic patterns of the classical NLSs are not essential for activity, thereby generating more unconventional patterns, including redox-sensitive NLSs. These results explain the causes of the NLS diversity. The defined consensus patterns and properties of importin alpha-dependent NLSs provide useful information for identifying NLSs.
18182025	Rice SVP-group MADS-box proteins, OsMADS22 and OsMADS55, are negative regulators of brassinosteroid responses.	2008	Plant J	Most short vegetative phase (SVP)-group MADS-box genes control meristem identity and flowering time. Among the three SVP-group genes in rice, OsMADS47 has been reported as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR) responses. Here, we investigated the functional roles of two close homologs, OsMADS22 and OsMADS55, by generating single, double and triple RNAi lines and overexpression lines. Analyses of the plants showed that their roles in regulating meristem identity are well conserved; however, the involvement of these genes in determining flowering time has diversified. Most importantly, OsMADS55 works as a major negative regulator of BR responses, and OsMADS22 functions to support OsMADS55. Whereas single OsMADS55 RNAi plants display weak BR responses in the lamina joint (LJ), OsMADS22-OsMADS55 double and OsMADS22-OsMADS47-OsMADS55 triple RNAi plants manifest dramatic BR responses with regard to LJ inclination, coleoptile elongation and senescence. Stem elongation is also notably reduced in the double and triple RNAi plants, probably because of BR oversensitivity. Expression analyses indicate the diversified roles in age-dependent BR responses. Altogether, our study demonstrates that all three rice SVP-group genes work as negative regulators of BR responses, but that their spatial and temporal roles are diversified.

16126864	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two types of noncoding RNAs involved in developmental regulation, genome maintenance, and defense in eukaryotes. The activity of Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) proteins is required for the maturation of miRNAs and siRNAs. In this study, we cloned and sequenced 66 candidate rice (Oryza sativa) miRNAs out of 1,650 small RNA sequences (19 to approximately 25 nt), and they could be further grouped into 21 families, 12 of which are newly identified and three of which, OsmiR528, OsmiR529, and OsmiR530, have been confirmed by northern blot. To study the function of rice DCL proteins (OsDCLs) in the biogenesis of miRNAs and siRNAs, we searched genome databases and identified four OsDCLs. An RNA interference approach was applied to knock down two OsDCLs, OsDCL1 and OsDCL4, respectively. Strong loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants that expressed inverted repeats of OsDCL1 resulted in developmental arrest at the seedling stage, and weak loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants caused pleiotropic developmental defects. Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice. In contrast, the production of siRNA from transgenic inverted repeats and endogenous CentO regions were not affected in either OsDCL1IR or OsDCL4IR transformants, suggesting that the production of miRNAs and siRNAs is via distinct OsDCLs.
17640358	MADS-box gene family in rice: genome-wide identification, organization and expression profiling during reproductive development and stress.	2007	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MADS-box transcription factors, besides being involved in floral organ specification, have also been implicated in several aspects of plant growth and development. In recent years, there have been reports on genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and expression of the entire MADS-box family in the model plant system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as well, an analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive expression profiling was still awaited after the completion of rice genome sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in flower development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional aspects of MADS-box genes in rice and Arabidopsis was required to understand the role of this gene family in reproductive development.

RESULTS: A genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression profiling of the genes encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75 MADS-box genes have been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma groups based on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type, are located within the duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20 in all, seem to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members belonging to the Mbeta group, which was considered absent in monocots, have also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have been analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development, three abiotic stress conditions, along with three stages of vegetative development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the reproductive phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds, and six genes show expression specific to panicle development. Differential expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An attempt has been made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of functionally validated genes in rice and Arabidopsis.

CONCLUSION: Only a limited number of MADS genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive annotation and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our understanding of the involvement of MADS-box family genes during reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.
12645264	[Molecular mapping of the fertility restorer gene Rf-4 for WA cytoplasmic male sterility in rice].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	The cytoplasmic male sterility for wild-abortive (CMS-WA) has been wildly used for hybrid rice breeding in China. The fertility restoration of CMS-WA is controlled mainly by two independent and dominant nuclear fertility restoring genes, Rf-3 and Rf-4. To map the Rf-4 gene with molecular markers, rice YAC clones of RGP, Japan were used to create new molecular marker. YAC contigs located between RFLP markers R1877 and G2155 on chromosome 10 were confirmed by hybridization with 12 RFLP probes. Six YAC clones, Y4630, Y2670, Y4892, Y2111, Y3821 and Y5528 were identified. Chromosome DNAs of the YAC clones were prepared and separated by CHEF. A total of 119 probes were created by sub-cloning of the YAC DNAs. RFLPs were screened between Zhenshan 97A and its near-isogenic lines with Rf-4Rf-4 genotype. Two probes, Y3-8 from Y4892 and Y1-10 from Y4630, were found to be polymorphic. Using F2 populations from crosses between Zhenshan 97A and its near-isogenic lines ZSR11, Y3-8 and Y1-10 were mapped to Rf-4 locus with genetic distances of 0.9 cM and 3.2 cM, respectively.
19522564	Suppression of the rice fatty-acid desaturase gene OsSSI2 enhances resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases in rice.	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Fatty acids and their derivatives play important signaling roles in plant defense responses. It has been shown that suppressing a gene for stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty-acid desaturase (SACPD) enhances the resistance of Arabidopsis (SSI2) and soybean to multiple pathogens. In this study, we present functional analyses of a rice homolog of SSI2 (OsSSI2) in disease resistance of rice plants. A transposon insertion mutation (Osssi2-Tos17) and RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsSSI2 (OsSSI2-kd) reduced the oleic acid (18:1) level and increased that of stearic acid (18:0), indicating that OsSSI2 is responsible for fatty-acid desaturase activity. These plants displayed spontaneous lesion formation in leaf blades, retarded growth, slight increase in endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) levels, and SA/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-specific inducible genes, including WRKY45, a key regulator of SA/BTH-induced resistance, in rice. Moreover, the OsSSI2-kd plants showed markedly enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and leaf-blight bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results suggest that OsSSI2 is involved in the negative regulation of defense responses in rice, as are its Arabidopsis and soybean counterparts. Microarray analyses identified 406 genes that were differentially expressed (>or=2-fold) in OsSSI2-kd rice plants compared with wild-type rice and, of these, approximately 39% were BTH responsive. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of SA-responsive genes, including WRKY45, is likely responsible for enhanced disease resistance in OsSSI2-kd rice plants.

21443631	An evolutionary view of functional diversity in family 1 glycosyltransferases.	2011	Plant J	Glycosyltransferases (GTs) (EC 2.4.x.y) catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties to a wide range of acceptor molecules, such as sugars, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, antibiotics and other small molecules, including plant secondary metabolites. These enzymes can be classified into at least 92 families, of which family 1 glycosyltransferases (GT1), often referred to as UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs), is the largest in the plant kingdom. To understand how UGTs expanded in both number and function during evolution of land plants, we screened genome sequences from six plants (Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata) for the presence of a conserved UGT protein domain. Phylogenetic analyses of the UGT genes revealed a significant expansion of UGTs, with lineage specificity and a higher duplication rate in vascular plants after the divergence of Physcomitrella. The UGTs from the six species fell into 24 orthologous groups that contained genes derived from the common ancestor of these six species. Some orthologous groups contained multiple UGT families with known functions, suggesting that UGTs discriminate compounds as substrates in a lineage-specific manner. Orthologous groups containing only a single UGT family tend to play a crucial role in plants, suggesting that such UGT families may have not expanded because of evolutionary constraints.
17443292	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of rice cell cycle genes.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and a number of other proteins control the progression of plant cell cycle. Although extensive studies have revealed the roles of some cell cycle regulators and the underlying mechanisms in Arabidopsis, relatively a small number of cell cycle regulators were functionally analyzed in rice. In this study, we describe 41 regulators in the rice genome. Our results indicate that the rice genome contains a less number of the core cell cycle regulators than the Arabidopsis one does, although the rice genome is much larger than the Arabidopsis one. Eight groups of CDKs similar to those in Arabidopsis were identified in the rice genome through phylogenetic analysis, and the corresponding members in the different groups include E2F, CKI, Rb, CKS and Wee. The structures of the core cell regulators were relatively conserved between the rice and Arabidopsis genomes. Furthermore, the expression of the majority of the core cell cycle genes was spatially regulated, and the most closely related ones showed very similar patterns of expression, suggesting functional redundancy and conservation between the highly similar core cell cycle genes in rice and Arabidopsis. Following auxin or cytokinin treatment, the expression of the core cell cycle genes was either upregulated or downregulated, suggesting that auxin and/or cytokinin may directly regulate the expression of the core cell cycle genes. Our results provide basic information to understand the mechanism of cell cycle regulation and the functions of the rice cell cycle genes.
18538315	The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period.	2008	Dev Biol	We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase. Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance. FSM encodes a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis FASCIATA1 (FAS1) that corresponds to the p150 subunit of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1). FSM is expressed patchily in tissues with actively dividing cells, suggesting a tight association of FSM with specific cell-cycle phases. Double-target in situ hybridization counterstained with cell-cycle marker genes revealed that FSM is expressed mainly in the G(1) phase. In fsm, expressions of the two marker genes representing S- and G(2)- to M-phases were enhanced in SAM, despite a reduced number of cells in SAM, suggesting that S- and G(2)-phases are prolonged in fsm. In addition, developmental events in fsm leaves took place at the proper time, indicating that the temporal regulation of development occurs independently of the cell-cycle period. In contrast to the fasciated phenotype of Arabidopsis fas1, fsm showed size reduction of SAM. The opposite phenotypes between fsm and fas1 indicate that the SAM maintenance is regulated differently between rice and Arabidopsis.
19546891	Adventitious root formation in rice requires OsGNOM1 and is mediated by the OsPINs family.	2009	Cell Res	The fibrous root system in cereals comprises primarily adventitious roots (ARs), which play important roles in nutrient and water uptake. Current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism underlying AR development is still limited. We report here the isolation of four rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutants, from different genetic backgrounds, all of which were defective in AR formation. These mutants exhibited reduced numbers of lateral roots (LRs) and partial loss of gravitropism. The mutants also displayed enhanced sensitivity to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an inhibitor of polar auxin transport (PAT), indicating that the mutations affected auxin transport. Positional cloning using one of the four mutants revealed that it was caused by loss-of-function of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (OsGNOM1). RT-PCR and analysis of promoter::GUS transgenic plants showed that OsGNOM1 is expressed in AR primordia, vascular tissues, LRs, root tips, leaves, anthers and lemma veins, with a distribution pattern similar to that of auxin. In addition, the expressions of OsPIN2, OsPIN5b and OsPIN9 were altered in the mutants. Taken together, these findings indicate that OsGNOM1 affects the formation of ARs through regulating PAT.
15258171	Activation of the Oryza sativa non-symbiotic haemoglobin-2 promoter by the cytokinin-regulated transcription factor, ARR1.	2004	J Exp Bot	Using in silico methods, several putative phytohormone-responsive cis-elements in the Oryza sativa non-symbiotic haemoglobin (NSHB) 1-4 and Arabidopsis thaliana NSHB1-2 promoters have been identified. An OsNSHB2 promoter::GUS reporter gene fusion shows tissue-specific expression in A. thaliana. GUS expression was observed in roots, the vasculature of young leaves, in flowers, and in the pedicel/stem junction. In transient assays, activity of the OsNSHB2 promoter was significantly up-regulated in the presence of the cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BA). Deletion analyses indicated that the full-length promoter was required for maximal trans-activation in the presence of cytokinin. Mutation of the single cytokinin-regulated ARR1-binding element abolished promoter activation in response to cytokinin. Constitutive expression of ARR1 under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter enhanced wild-type OsNSHB2 promoter activity, but had no effect on the activity of the mutated promoter in the absence of cytokinin. However, overexpression of ARR1 in the presence of cytokinin resulted in super-activation of the wild-type promoter. The mutated promoter was only moderately activated in the presence of cytokinin and ARR1, indicating that the OsNSHB2 promoter can be regulated by the ARR1 protein, but requires other cytokinin-induced factors for optimal activation. This is the first report that identifies a trans-acting factor involved in the activation of a NSHB gene.
22924020	Genetic characterization of a reciprocal translocation present in a widely grown barley variety.	2012	Mol Breed	Artificially induced translocation stocks have been used to physically map the barley genome; however, natural translocations are extremely uncommon in cultivated genotypes. Albacete is a barley variety widely grown in recent decades in Spain and carrying a reciprocal translocation which obviously does not affect its agronomical fitness. This translocation has been characterized by a combination of cytological and molecular genetic approaches. Firstly, recombination frequencies between markers on chromosomes 1H and 3H were estimated to determine the boundaries of the reciprocal interchange. Secondly, 1H-3H wheat barley telosome addition lines were used to assign selected markers to chromosome arms. Thirdly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rDNA probes (5S and 18S-5.8S-26S) and microsatellite probes [(ACT)(5), (AAG)(5) and (CAG)(5)] was used to determine the locations of the translocation breakpoints more precisely. Fourthly, fine-mapping of the regions around the translocation breakpoints was used to increase the marker density for comparative genomics. The results obtained in this study indicate that the translocation is quite large with breakpoints located on the long arms of chromosomes 1H and 3H, between the pericentromeric (AAG)(5) bands and above the (ACT)(5) interstitial distal bands, resulting in the reciprocal translocation 1HS.1HL-3HL and 3HS.3HL-1HL. The gene content around the translocation breakpoints could be inferred from syntenic relationships observed among different species from the grass family Poaceae (rice, Sorghum and Brachypodium) and was estimated at approximately 1,100 and 710 gene models for 1H and 3H, respectively. Duplicated segments between chromosomes Os01 and Os05 in rice derived from ancestral duplications within the grass family overlap with the translocation breakpoints on chromosomes 1H and 3H in the barley variety Albacete.
24280008	OsRap2.6 transcription factor contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with Receptor for Activated Kinase-C 1 (RACK1).	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice small GTPase OsRac1 is a molecular switch in rice innate immunity. The Receptor for Activated Kinase C-1 (RACK1) interacts with OsRac1 to suppress the growth of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. RACK1 has two homologs in rice, RACK1A and RACK1B. Overexpressing RACK1A enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus. However, RACK1A downstream signals are largely unknown.

RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of OsRap2.6, a transcription factor that interacts with RACK1A. We found a 94% similarity between the OsRap2.6 AP2 domain and Arabidopsis Rap2.6 (AtRap2.6). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in rice protoplasts using tagged OsRap2.6 and RACK1A with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of Venus (Vc/Vn) indicated that OsRap2.6 and RACK1A interacted and localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, OsRap2.6 and OsMAPK3/6 interacted in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2.6 was induced after chitin treatment. Disease resistance analysis using OsRap2.6 RNAi and overexpressing (Ox) plants infected with the rice blast fungus indicated that OsRap2.6 RNAi plants were highly susceptible, whereas OsRap2.6 Ox plants had an increased resistance to the compatible blast fungus.

CONCLUSIONS: OsRap2.6 contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with RACK1A in compatible interactions.
22950899	Sequence variations in OsAGPase significantly associated with amylose content and viscosity properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Genet Res (Camb)	Sequence-based variations in starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) exert a basic influence on the determination of eating quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the sequence variations from parts of 10 SSRGs and the amylose content (AC) plus rapid viscosity analysis (RVA) profiles in a heuristic rice core set by association mapping (AM). In total, 86 sequence variations were found in 10 sequenced amplicons, including 79 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six insertion-deletions (InDels) and one polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR). Among them, 61 variations were exon-based, of which 41 should lead to amino acid changes. Four subpopulations were revealed by population structure analysis based on 170 genome-wide SSR genotypes. The final AM showed a sum of four significant associations between three phenotypic indices and three sequence variations. An ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small unit 1 (OsAGPS1) SNP (A-G) was significantly associated with increased AC (P<0·001, R(2)=15·6%), while a 12-bp deletion of AGPase large unit 4 (OsAGPL4) was significantly related to the decreased breakdown viscosity (BDV) (P<0·001, R(2)=16·6%) in both general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM). This study provides a new perspective of allele mining for breeding strategies based on marker-assisted selection.
23412633	Population structural analysis of an in-situ conservation site for wild rice in Laos.	2012	Genes Genet Syst	An in-situ conservation site in Laos for a mixture of annual and perennial wild rice, LV27, which is a single swamp with an observation pier has been developed. In order to develop a strategy for evaluation of natural resources, systematic leaf sampling has been conducted and their genetic characteristics measured with 16 SSR loci. In order to determine population structure, a small number of individuals localized together were regarded as sub-populations belonging to a single mother population. Annual individuals were clustered at particular peripheral areas of the pond. Perennial individuals were close by and growing within deeper pond water. Scores of observed heterozygosity (Ho) were not significantly different between annual and perennial sub-populations, but relatively lower in annual ones. Genetic distance among annual and perennial sub-populations in close juxtaposition at peripheral sites showed that annuals were clustered against perennials. In addition, comparison of perennial sub-populations peripheral areas and inside the swamp, found they clustered together and were some distance from annual ones. When the genetic components were compared in detail, private alleles were frequently found in annual plants, suggesting there might be restriction of gene flow between annual and perennial types. Partitions of deep water perennial sub-populations identified private alleles in particular areas, suggesting there were some areas with unique polymorphisms. Combining peripheral perennial sub-populations led to the disappearance of most private alleles which implied there is frequent gene flow among perennial sub-populations. This in-situ conservation site allowed us to observe the succession of populations and also to research detailed population structure of a typical wild population and this found wild rice genetic structure in this single swamp is complex. The data obtained will provide valuable insight about how to evaluate wild populations genetically and how to deal with such populations as field collections.
22417073	Phylogenetics and evolution of Trx SET genes in fully sequenced land plants.	2012	Genome	Plant Trx SET proteins are involved in H3K4 methylation and play a key role in plant floral development. Genes encoding Trx SET proteins constitute a multigene family in which the copy number varies among plant species and functional divergence appears to have occurred repeatedly. To investigate the evolutionary history of the Trx SET gene family, we made a comprehensive evolutionary analysis on this gene family from 13 major representatives of green plants. A novel clustering (here named as cpTrx clade), which included the III-1, III-2, and III-4 orthologous groups, previously resolved was identified. Our analysis showed that plant Trx proteins possessed a variety of domain organizations and gene structures among paralogs. Additional domains such as PHD, PWWP, and FYR were early integrated into primordial SET-PostSET domain organization of cpTrx clade. We suggested that the PostSET domain was lost in some members of III-4 orthologous group during the evolution of land plants. At least four classes of gene structures had been formed at the early evolutionary stage of land plants. Three intronless orphan Trx SET genes from the Physcomitrella patens (moss) were identified, and supposedly, their parental genes have been eliminated from the genome. The structural differences among evolutionary groups of plant Trx SET genes with different functions were described, contributing to the design of further experimental studies.
21959909	High resolution mapping of Dense spike-ar (dsp.ar) to the genetic centromere of barley chromosome 7H.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Spike density in barley is under the control of several major genes, as documented previously by genetic analysis of a number of morphological mutants. One such class of mutants affects the rachis internode length leading to dense or compact spikes and the underlying genes were designated dense spike (dsp). We previously delimited two introgressed genomic segments on chromosome 3H (21 SNP loci, 35.5 cM) and 7H (17 SNP loci, 20.34 cM) in BW265, a BC(7)F(3) nearly isogenic line (NIL) of cv. Bowman as potentially containing the dense spike mutant locus dsp.ar, by genotyping 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in both BW265 and its recurrent parent. Here, the gene was allocated by high-resolution bi-parental mapping to a 0.37 cM interval between markers SC57808 (Hv_SPL14)-CAPSK06413 residing on the short and long arm at the genetic centromere of chromosome 7H, respectively. This region putatively contains more than 800 genes as deduced by comparison with the collinear regions of barley, rice, sorghum and Brachypodium, Classical map-based isolation of the gene dsp.ar thus will be complicated due to the infavorable relationship of genetic to physical distances at the target locus.
22083356	Identifying novel QTLs for submergence tolerance in rice cultivars IR72 and Madabaru.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Short-term submergence is a recurring problem in many rice production areas. The SUB1 gene, derived from the tolerant variety FR13A, has been transferred to a number of widely grown varieties, allowing them to withstand complete submergence for up to 2 weeks. However, in areas where longer-term submergence occurs, improved varieties having higher tolerance levels are needed. To search for novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from other donors, an F(2:3) population between IR72 and Madabaru, both moderately tolerant varieties, was investigated. After a repeated phenotyping of 466 families under submergence stress, a subset of 80 families selected from the two extreme phenotypic tails was used for the QTL analysis. Phenotypic data showed transgressive segregation, with several families having an even higher survival rate than the FR13A-derived tolerant check (IR40931). Four QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 9, and 12; the largest QTL on chromosome 1 had a LOD score of 11.2 and R (2) of 52.3%. A QTL mapping to the SUB1 region on chromosome 9, with a LOD score of 3.6 and R (2) of 18.6%, had the tolerant allele from Madabaru, while the other three QTLs had tolerant alleles from IR72. The identification of three non-SUB1 QTLs from IR72 suggests that an alternative pathway may be present in this variety that is independent of the ethylene-dependent pathway mediated by the SUB1A gene. These novel QTLs can be combined with SUB1 using marker assisted backcrossing in an effort to enhance the level of submergence tolerance for flood-prone areas.
24279948	Comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed rice actin depolymerizing factor gene family and heterologous overexpression of OsADF3 confers Arabidopsis Thaliana drought tolerance.	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are small actin-binding proteins. Many higher-plant ADFs has been known to involve in plant growth, development and pathogen defense. However, in rice the temporal and spatial expression of OsADF gene family and their relationship with abiotic stresses tolerance is still unknown.

RESULTS: Here we reported the first comprehensive gene expression profile analysis of OsADF gene family. The OsADF genes showed distinct and overlapping gene expression patterns at different growth stages, tissues and abiotic stresses. We also demonstrated that both OsADF1 and OsADF3 proteins were localized in the nucleus. OsADF1 and OsADF3 were preferentially expressed in vascular tissues. Under ABA or abiotic stress treatments, OsADF3::GUS activity was enhanced in lateral roots and root tips. Ectopically overexpressed OsADF3 conferred the mannitol- and drought-stress tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings by increasing germination rate, primary root length and survival. Several drought-tolerance responsive genes (RD22, ABF4, DREB2A, RD29A, PIP1; 4 and PIP2; 6) were upregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under drought stress.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that OsADF gene family may participate in plant abiotic stresses response or tolerance and would facilitate functional validation of other OsADF genes.
21938473	A QTL for rice grain yield in aerobic environments with large effects in three genetic backgrounds.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	A large-effect QTL associated with grain yield in aerobic environments was identified in three genetic backgrounds, Apo/(2)*Swarna, Apo/(2)*IR72, and Vandana/(2)*IR72, using bulk-segregant analysis (BSA). Apo and Vandana are drought-tolerant aerobic-adapted varieties, while Swarna and IR72 are important lowland rice varieties grown on millions of hectares in Asia but perform poorly in aerobic conditions. Two closely linked rice microsatellite (RM) markers, RM510 and RM19367, located on chromosome 6, were found to be associated with yield under aerobic soil conditions in all three backgrounds. The QTL linked to this marker, qDTY6.1 (DTY, grain yield under drought), was mapped to a 2.2 cM region between RM19367 and RM3805 at a peak LOD score of 32 in the Apo/(2)*Swarna population. The effect of qDTY6.1 was tested in a total of 20 hydrological environments over a period of five seasons and in five populations in the three genetic backgrounds. In the Apo/(2)*Swarna population, qDTY6.1 had a large effect on grain yield under favorable aerobic (R (2) ≤ 66%) and irrigated lowland (R (2) < 39%) conditions but not under drought stress; Apo contributed the favorable allele in all the conditions where an effect was observed. In the Apo/IR72 cross, Apo contributed the favorable allele in almost all the aerobic environments in RIL and BC(1)-derived populations. In the Vandana/IR72 RIL and BC(1)-derived populations, qDTY6.1 had a strong effect on yield in aerobic drought stress, aerobic non-stress, and irrigated lowland conditions; the Vandana allele was favorable in aerobic environments and the IR72 allele was favorable in irrigated lowland environments. We conclude that qDTY6.1 is a large-effect QTL for rice grain yield under aerobic environments and could potentially be used in molecular breeding of rice for aerobic environments.
15111724	Simple RNAi vectors for stable and transient suppression of gene function in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Since the recent sequencing of the rice genome, the functional identification of rice genes has become increasingly important. Various tagged lines have been generated; however, the number of tagged genes available is not sufficient for extensive study of gene function. To help identify the functions of genes in rice, we developed a Gateway vector, pANDA, for RNA interference of rice genes. This vector can be used for Agrobacterium transformation of rice and allows easy and fast construction of efficient RNAi vectors. In the construct, hairpin RNA derived from a given gene is transcribed from a strong maize ubiquitin promoter, and an intron is placed 5' upstream of inverted repeats to enhance RNA expression. Analysis of rice genes using this vector showed that suppression of mRNA expression was observed in more than 90% of transgenic plants examined, and short interfering RNA indicative of RNA silencing was detected in each silenced plant. A similar vector, pANDA-mini, was also developed for direct transfer into leaf cells or protoplasts. This vector can be used for transient suppression of gene function in rice. These vectors should help identify the functions of rice genes whose tagged mutants are not available at present and complement existing methods for functional genomics of rice.
12566582	Duplicated fie genes in maize: expression pattern and imprinting suggest distinct functions.	2003	Plant Cell	Two maize genes with predicted translational similarity to the Arabidopsis FIE (Fertilization-Independent Endosperm) protein, a repressor of endosperm development in the absence of fertilization, were cloned and analyzed. Genomic sequences of fie1 and fie2 show significant homology within coding regions but none within introns or 5' upstream. The fie1 gene is expressed exclusively in the endosperm of developing kernels starting at approximately 6 days after pollination. fie1 is an imprinted gene showing no detectable expression of the paternally derived fie1 allele during kernel development. Conversely, fie2 is expressed in the embryo sac before pollination. After pollination, its expression persists, predominantly in the embryo and at lower levels in the endosperm. The paternal fie2 allele is not expressed early in kernel development, but its transcription is activated at 5 days after pollination. fie2 is likely to be a functional ortholog of the Arabidopsis FIE gene, whereas fie1 has evolved a distinct function. The maize FIE2 and sorghum FIE proteins form a monophyletic group, sharing a closer relationship to each other than to the FIE1 protein, suggesting that maize fie genes originated from two different ancestral genomes.
17617177	OsRAD21-3, an orthologue of yeast RAD21, is required for pollen development in Oryza sativa.	2007	Plant J	In contrast to animals, in which products of meiosis differentiate directly into sperm, flowering plants employ a specific mechanism to give rise to functional sperm cells, the specifics of which remain largely unknown. A previous study revealed that, compared to yeast and vertebrates, which have two proteins (Rad21 and its meiosis-specific variant Rec8) that play a vital role in sister chromatid cohesion and segregation for mitosis and meiosis, respectively, the rice genome encodes four Rad21/Rec8 proteins (OsRad21s). In this paper, phylogenetic and immunostaining analyses reveal that OsRad21-3 is an orthologue of yeast Rad21. OsRAD21-3 transcript and protein accumulated preferentially in flowers, with low levels in vegetative tissues. In flowers, they persisted from the stamen and carpel primordia stages until the mature pollen stage. OsRAD21-3-deficient RNAi lines showed arrested pollen mitosis, aberrant pollen chromosome segregation and aborted pollen grains, which led to disrupted pollen viability. However, male meiosis in these RNAi lines did not appear to be severely disrupted, which suggests that the main involvement of OsRAD21-3 is in post-meiotic pollen development by affecting pollen mitosis. Furthermore, of the four OsRAD21 genes in the rice genome, only OsRAD21-3 was expressed in pollen grains. Given that the mechanism involving generation of sperm cells differs between flowering plants and metozoans, this study shows, in part, why flowering plants of rice and Arabidopsis have four Rad21/Rec8 proteins, as compared with two in yeast and metozoans, and gives some clues to the functional differentiation of Rad21/Rec8 proteins during evolution.
15599592	Rice K+ uptake channel OsAKT1 is sensitive to salt stress.	2005	Planta	Potassium ions constitute the most important macronutrients taken up by plants. To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1. OsAKT1 transcripts were predominantly found in the coleoptile and in the roots of young rice seedlings. K+ channel mRNA decreases in response to salt stress, both in the shoot and in the root of 4-day-old rice seedlings. Following expression in HEK293 cells, we were able to characterize OsAKT1 as a voltage-dependent, inward-rectifying K+ channel regulated by extracellular Ca2+ and protons. Patch-clamp studies on rice root protoplasts identified a K+ inward rectifier with similar channel properties as heterologously expressed OsAKT1. In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts. Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots.
21626211	Origin and evolution of genes related to ABA metabolism and its signaling pathways.	2011	J Plant Res	Since plants cannot move to avoid stress, they have sophisticated acclimation mechanisms against a variety of abiotic stresses. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays essential roles in abiotic stress tolerances in land plants. Therefore, it is interesting to address the evolutionary origins of ABA metabolism and its signaling pathways in land plants. Here, we focused on 48 ABA-related Arabidopsis thaliana genes with 11 protein functions, and generated 11 orthologous clusters of ABA-related genes from A. thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Populus trichocarpa, Oryza sativa, Selaginella moellendorffii, and Physcomitrella patens. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the common ancestor of these six species possessed most of the key protein functions of ABA-related genes. In two species (A. thaliana and O. sativa), duplicate genes related to ABA signaling pathways contribute to the expression variation in different organs or stress responses. In particular, there is significant expansion of gene families related to ABA in evolutionary periods associated with morphological divergence. Taken together, these results suggest that expansion of the gene families related to ABA signaling pathways may have contributed to the sophisticated stress tolerance mechanisms of higher land plants.
21620514	Convergent or parallel molecular evolution of momilactone A and B: potent allelochemicals, momilactones have been found only in rice and the moss Hypnum plumaeforme.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Plant second metabolites momilactone A and B, which act as potent phytoalexins and allelochemicals, have been found thus far only in rice and the moss Hypnum plumaeforme, although both plants are taxonomically quite distinct. The concentrations of momilactone A and B, respectively, in rice plants were 4.5-140 and 2.9-85μg/g, and those in H. plumaeforme were 8.4-58.7 and 4.2-23.4μg/g. Momilactone A and B concentrations in rice and H. plumaeforme plants were increased by UV irradiation, elicitor and jasmonic acid treatments. Rice and H. plumaeforme plants secrete momilactone A and B into the rhizosphere, and the secretion level was also increased by UV irradiation, elicitor and jasmonic acid treatments. In addition, although endogenous concentrations of momilactone A in rice and H. plumaeforme were greater than those of momilactone B, the secretion levels of momilactone B were greater than those of momilactone A in rice and H. plumaeforme, which suggests that momilactone B may be selectively secreted by both rice and H. plumaeforme. As momilactone A and B exert potent antifungal and growth inhibitory activities, momilactone A and B may play an important role in the defense responses in H. plumaeforme and rice against pathogen infections and in allelopathy. The secretion of momilactone A and B into the rhizosphere may also prevent bacterial and fungal infections and provide a competitive advantage for nutrients through the inhibition of invading root systems of neighboring plants as allelochemicals. Therefore, both plants, despite their evolutionary distance, may use same defense strategy with respect to the momilactone A and B production and secretion, which resulting from convergent or parallel evolutionary processes. In the case of parallel evolution, there may be plant species providing the missing link in molecular evolution of momilactones between H. plumaeforme and rice.
21277362	Gene tree discordance of wild and cultivated Asian rice deciphered by genome-wide sequence comparison.	2011	Gene	Although a large number of genes are expected to correctly solve a phylogenetic relationship, inconsistent gene tree topologies have been observed. This conflicting evidence in gene tree topologies, known as gene tree discordance, becomes increasingly important as advanced sequencing technologies produce an enormous amount of sequence information for phylogenomic studies among closely related species. Here, we aim to characterize the gene tree discordance of the Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its progenitor, O. rufipogon, which will be an ideal case study of gene tree discordance. Using genome and cDNA sequences of O. sativa and O. rufipogon, we have conducted the first in-depth analyses of gene tree discordance in Asian rice. Our comparison of full-length cDNA sequences of O. rufipogon with the genome sequences of the japonica and indica cultivars of O. sativa revealed that 60% of the gene trees showed a topology consistent with the expected one, whereas the remaining genes supported significantly different topologies. Moreover, the proportions of the topologies deviated significantly from expectation, suggesting at least one hybridization event between the two subgroups of O. sativa, japonica and indica. In fact, a genome-wide alignment between japonica and indica indicated that significant portions of the indica genome are derived from japonica. In addition, literature concerning the pedigree of the indica cultivar strongly supported the hybridization hypothesis. Our molecular evolutionary analyses deciphered complicated evolutionary processes in closely related species. They also demonstrated the importance of gene tree discordance in the era of high-speed DNA sequencing.
21622811	Differential molecular responses of rice and wheat coleoptiles to anoxia reveal novel metabolic adaptations in amino acid metabolism for tissue tolerance.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) are the most important starch crops in world agriculture. While both germinate with an anatomically similar coleoptile, this tissue defines the early anoxia tolerance of rice and the anoxia intolerance of wheat seedlings. We combined protein and metabolite profiling analysis to compare the differences in response to anoxia between the rice and wheat coleoptiles. Rice coleoptiles responded to anoxia dramatically, not only at the level of protein synthesis but also at the level of altered metabolite pools, while the wheat response to anoxia was slight in comparison. We found significant increases in the abundance of proteins in rice coleoptiles related to protein translation and antioxidant defense and an accumulation of a set of enzymes involved in serine, glycine, and alanine biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or pyruvate, which correlates with an observed accumulation of these amino acids in anoxic rice. We show a positive effect on wheat root anoxia tolerance by exogenous addition of these amino acids, indicating that their synthesis could be linked to rice anoxia tolerance. The potential role of amino acid biosynthesis contributing to anoxia tolerance in cells is discussed.
21300183	Proteomic identification of rhythmic proteins in rice seedlings.	2011	Biochim Biophys Acta	Many aspects of plant metabolism that are involved in plant growth and development are influenced by light-regulated diurnal rhythms as well as endogenous clock-regulated circadian rhythms. To identify the rhythmic proteins in rice, periodically grown (12h light/12h dark cycle) seedlings were harvested for three days at six-hour intervals. Continuous dark-adapted plants were also harvested for two days. Among approximately 3000 reproducible protein spots on each gel, proteomic analysis ascertained 354 spots (~12%) as light-regulated rhythmic proteins, in which 53 spots showed prolonged rhythm under continuous dark conditions. Of these 354 ascertained rhythmic protein spots, 74 diurnal spots and 10 prolonged rhythmic spots under continuous dark were identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The rhythmic proteins were functionally classified into photosynthesis, central metabolism, protein synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, stress resistance, signal transduction and unknown. Comparative analysis of our proteomic data with the public microarray database (the Plant DIURNAL Project) and RT-PCR analysis of rhythmic proteins showed differences in rhythmic expression phases between mRNA and protein, suggesting that the clock-regulated proteins in rice are modulated by not only transcriptional but also post-transcriptional, translational, and/or post-translational processes.
21442326	Evolution of the number of LRRs in plant disease resistance genes.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	The largest group of plant resistance (R) genes contain the regions that encode the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (NBS-LRR genes). To gain new resistance, amino acid substitutions and changes in number of the LRRs that recognize the presence of pathogens are considered important. In this study, we focus on the evolution of the number of LRRs and analyze the genome data of five plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus and Populus trichocarpa. We first categorized the NBS-LRR genes in each species into groups and subgroups based on the phylogenetic relationships of their NBS domain sequences. Then we estimated the evolutionary rate of the number of LRRs relative to the synonymous divergence in the NBS domain sequences by a maximum likelihood method assuming the single stepwise mutation model. The estimates ranged from 4.5 to 600 and differed between groups in the same species or between species. This indicated different roles played by different groups of the NBS-LRR genes within a species or the effects of various life history characteristics, such as generation time, of the species. We also tested the fit of the model to the data using the variance of number of LRRs in each subgroup. In some subgroups in some plants (16 out of 174 subgroups), the results of simulation using the estimated rates significantly deviated from the observed data. Those subgroups may have undergone different modes of selection from the other subgroups.
21573763	Bayesian functional mapping of dynamic quantitative traits.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Without consideration of other linked QTLs responsible for dynamic trait, original functional mapping based on a single QTL model is not optimal for analyzing multiple dynamic trait loci. Despite that composite functional mapping incorporates the effects of genetic background outside the tested QTL in mapping model, the arbitrary choice of background markers also impact on the power of QTL detection. In this study, we proposed Bayesian functional mapping strategy that can simultaneously identify multiple QTL controlling developmental patterns of dynamic traits over the genome. Our proposed method fits the change of each QTL effect with the time by Legendre polynomial and takes the residual covariance structure into account using the first autoregressive equation. Also, Bayesian shrinkage estimation was employed to estimate the model parameters. Especially, we specify the gamma distribution as the prior for the first-order auto-regressive coefficient, which will guarantee the convergence of Bayesian sampling. Simulations showed that the proposed method could accurately estimate the QTL parameters and had a greater statistical power of QTL detection than the composite functional mapping. A real data analysis of leaf age growth in rice is used for the demonstration of our method. It shows that our Bayesian functional mapping can detect more QTLs as compared to composite functional mapping.
21713535	A molecular map of the apomixis-control locus in Paspalum procurrens and its comparative analysis with other species of Paspalum.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Since apomixis was first mapped in Paspalum, the absence of recombination that characterizes the related locus appeared to be the most difficult bottleneck to overcome for the dissection of the genetic determinants that control this trait. An approach to break the block of recombination was developed in this genus through an among-species comparative mapping strategy. A new apomictic species, P. procurrens (Q4094) was crossed with a sexual plant of P. simplex and their progeny was classified for reproductive mode with the aid of morphological, embryological and genetic analyses. On this progeny, a set of heterologous rice RFLP markers strictly co-segregating in coupling phase with apomixis was identified. These markers were all located on the telomeric region of the long arm of the chromosome 12 of rice. In spite of the lack of recombination exhibited by the apomixis-linked markers in P. procurrens, a comparative mapping analysis among P. simplex, P. malacophyllum, P. notatum and P. procurrens, allowed us to identify a small group of markers co-segregating with apomixis in all these species. These markers bracketed a chromosome region that likely contains all the genetic determinants of apomictic reproduction in Paspalum. The implications of this new inter-specific approach for overcoming the block of recombination to isolate the genetic determinants of apomixis and gain a better comprehension of genome structure of apomictic chromosome region are discussed.
21713536	Targeted association analysis identified japonica rice varieties achieving Na(+)/K (+) homeostasis without the allelic make-up of the salt tolerant indica variety Nona Bokra.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	During the last decade, a large number of QTLs and candidate genes for rice tolerance to salinity have been reported. Using 124 SNP and 52 SSR markers, we targeted 14 QTLs and 65 candidate genes for association mapping within the European Rice Core collection (ERCC) comprising 180 japonica accessions. Significant differences in phenotypic response to salinity were observed. Nineteen distinct loci significantly associated with one or more phenotypic response traits were detected. Linkage disequilibrium between these loci was extremely low, indicating a random distribution of favourable alleles in the ERCC. Analysis of the function of these loci indicated that all major tolerance mechanisms were present in the ERCC although the useful level of expression of the different mechanisms was scattered among different accessions. Under moderate salinity stress some accessions achieved the same level of control of Na(+) concentration and Na(+)/K(+) equilibrium as the indica reference variety for salinity tolerance Nona Bokra, although without sharing the same alleles at several loci associated with Na(+) concentration. This suggests (a) differences between indica and japonica subspecies in the effect of QTLs and genes involved in salinity tolerance and (b) further potential for the improvement of tolerance to salinity above the tolerance level of Nona Bokra, provided the underlying mechanisms are complementary at the whole plant level. No accession carried all favourable alleles, or showed the best phenotypic responses for all traits measured. At least nine accessions were needed to assemble the favourable alleles and all the best phenotypic responses. An effective strategy for the accumulation of the favourable alleles would be marker-assisted population improvement.
21437642	Prediction of new abiotic stress genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa according to enumeration-based statistical analysis.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Plants undergo an extensive change in gene regulation during abiotic stress. It is of great agricultural importance to know which genes are affected during stress response. The genome sequence of a number of plant species has been determined, among them Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa, whose genome has been annotated most completely as of yet, and are well-known organisms widely used as experimental systems. This paper applies a statistical algorithm for predicting new stress-induced motifs and genes by analyzing promoter sets co-regulated by abiotic stress in the previously mentioned two species. After identifying characteristic putative regulatory motif sequence pairs (dyads) in the promoters of 125 stress-regulated Arabidopsis genes and 87 O. sativa genes, these dyads were used to screen the entire Arabidopsis and O. sativa promoteromes to find related stress-induced genes whose promoters contained a large number of these dyads found by our algorithm. We were able to predict a number of putative dyads, characteristic of a large number of stress-regulated genes, some of them newly discovered by our algorithm and serve as putative transcription factor binding sites. Our new motif prediction algorithm comes complete with a stand-alone program. This algorithm may be used in motif discovery in the future in other species. The more than 1,200 Arabidopsis and 1,700 Orzya sativa genes found by our algorithm are good candidates for further experimental studies in abiotic stress.
21377754	Azospirillum and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization enhance rice growth and physiological traits under well-watered and drought conditions.	2011	J Plant Physiol	The response of rice plants to inoculation with an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Azospirillum brasilense, or combination of both microorganisms, was assayed under well-watered or drought stress conditions. Water deficit treatment was imposed by reducing the amount of water added, but AM plants, with a significantly higher biomass, received the same amount of water as non-AM plants, with a poor biomass. Thus, the water stress treatment was more severe for AM plants than for non-AM plants. The results showed that AM colonization significantly enhanced rice growth under both water conditions, although the greatest rice development was reached in plants dually inoculated under well-watered conditions. Water level did not affect the efficiency of photosystem II, but both AM and A. brasilense inoculations increased this value. AM colonization increased stomatal conductance, particularly when associated with A. brasilense, which enhanced this parameter by 80% under drought conditions and by 35% under well-watered conditions as compared to single AM plants. Exposure of AM rice to drought stress decreased the high levels of glutathione that AM plants exhibited under well-watered conditions, while drought had no effect on the ascorbate content. The decrease of glutathione content in AM plants under drought stress conditions led to enhance lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, inoculation with the AM fungus itself increased ascorbate and proline as protective compounds to cope with the harmful effects of water limitation. Inoculation with A. brasilense also enhanced ascorbate accumulation, reaching a similar level as in AM plants. These results showed that, in spite of the fact that drought stress imposed by AM treatments was considerably more severe than non-AM treatments, rice plants benefited not only from the AM symbiosis but also from A. brasilense root colonization, regardless of the watering level. However, the beneficial effects of A. brasilense on most of the physiological and biochemical traits of rice plants were only clearly visible when the plants were mycorrhized. This microbial consortium was effective for rice plants as an acceptable and ecofriendly technology to improve plant performance and development.
21400017	Drought-induced proline accumulation is uninvolved with increased nitric oxide, which alleviates drought stress by decreasing transpiration in rice.	2012	J Plant Res	Accumulation of proline is trusted to be an adaptive response of plants against drought stress, and exogenous application of nitric oxide (NO) enhances proline accumulation in Cu-treated algae. In order to investigate whether NO works as a necessary signaling molecule in drought-induced proline accumulation in rice leaves, effects of drought stress on endogenous NO content and proline accumulation were studied in rice leaves, using sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO, a NO scavenger). The results showed that drought treatment increased both endogenous NO and proline contents in rice leaves, while foliar spray of various concentrations of SNP failed to induce proline accumulation in the leaves of well-watered rice and foliar spray of cPTIO failed to inhibit proline accumulation in the leaves of drought-stressed rice. These results indicate that increase of endogenous NO is dispensable for proline accumulation in the leaves of rice under drought stress. Further studies indicate that exogenous application of NO alleviates drought-induced water loss and ion leakage by decreasing transpiration rate of rice leaves.
21601944	D-Psicose induces upregulation of defense-related genes and resistance in rice against bacterial blight.	2011	J Plant Physiol	We examined rice responses to a rare sugar, d-psicose. Rice growth was inhibited by d-psicose but not by common sugars. Microarray analysis revealed that d-psicose treatment caused an upregulation of many defense-related genes in rice, and dose-dependent upregulation of these genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The level of upregulation of defense-related genes by d-psicose was low compared with that by d-allose, which is another rare sugar known to confer induction of resistance to rice bacterial blight in rice. Treatment with d-psicose conferred resistance to bacterial blight in rice in a dose-dependent manner, and the results indicate that d-psicose might be a candidate plant activator for reducing disease development in rice.
22158467	Massive analysis of rice small RNAs: mechanistic implications of regulated microRNAs and variants for differential target RNA cleavage.	2011	Plant Cell	Small RNAs have a variety of important roles in plant development, stress responses, and other processes. They exert their influence by guiding mRNA cleavage, translational repression, and chromatin modification. To identify previously unknown rice (Oryza sativa) microRNAs (miRNAs) and those regulated by environmental stress, 62 small RNA libraries were constructed from rice plants and used for deep sequencing with Illumina technology. The libraries represent several tissues from control plants and plants subjected to different environmental stress treatments. More than 94 million genome-matched reads were obtained, resulting in more than 16 million distinct small RNA sequences. This allowed an evaluation of ~400 annotated miRNAs with current criteria and the finding that among these, ~150 had small interfering RNA-like characteristics. Seventy-six new miRNAs were found, and miRNAs regulated in response to water stress, nutrient stress, or temperature stress were identified. Among the new examples of miRNA regulation were members of the same miRNA family that were differentially regulated in different organs and had distinct sequences Some of these distinct family members result in differential target cleavage and provide new insight about how an agriculturally important rice phenotype could be regulated in the panicle. This high-resolution analysis of rice miRNAs should be relevant to plant miRNAs in general, particularly in the Poaceae.
22138690	Genome-wide association study of flowering time and grain yield traits in a worldwide collection of rice germplasm.	2011	Nat Genet	A high-density haplotype map recently enabled a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a population of indica subspecies of Chinese rice landraces. Here we extend this methodology to a larger and more diverse sample of 950 worldwide rice varieties, including the Oryza sativa indica and Oryza sativa japonica subspecies, to perform an additional GWAS. We identified a total of 32 new loci associated with flowering time and with ten grain-related traits, indicating that the larger sample increased the power to detect trait-associated variants using GWAS. To characterize various alleles and complex genetic variation, we developed an analytical framework for haplotype-based de novo assembly of the low-coverage sequencing data in rice. We identified candidate genes for 18 associated loci through detailed annotation. This study shows that the integrated approach of sequence-based GWAS and functional genome annotation has the potential to match complex traits to their causal polymorphisms in rice.
17601170	Sucrose-mediated priming of plant defense responses and broad-spectrum disease resistance by overexpression of the maize pathogenesis-related PRms protein in rice plants.	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes is part of the plant's natural defense response against pathogen attack. The PRms gene encodes a fungal-inducible PR protein from maize. Here, we demonstrate that expression of PRms in transgenic rice confers broad-spectrum protection against pathogens, including fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae, Fusarium verticillioides, and Helminthosporium oryzae) and bacterial (Erwinia chrysanthemi) pathogens. The PRms-mediated disease resistance in rice plants is associated with an enhanced capacity to express and activate the natural plant defense mechanisms. Thus, PRms rice plants display a basal level of expression of endogenous defense genes in the absence of the pathogen. PRms plants also exhibit stronger and quicker defense responses during pathogen infection. We also have found that sucrose accumulates at higher levels in leaves of PRms plants. Sucrose responsiveness of rice defense genes correlates with the pathogen-responsive priming of their expression in PRms rice plants. Moreover, pretreatment of rice plants with sucrose enhances resistance to M. oryzae infection. Together, these results support a sucrose-mediated priming of defense responses in PRms rice plants which results in broad-spectrum disease resistance.
14730064	Calcium sensors and their interacting protein kinases: genomics of the Arabidopsis and rice CBL-CIPK signaling networks.	2004	Plant Physiol	Calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli and regulate a wide range of physiological processes. Calcium-binding proteins, like calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium signaling. These proteins form a complex network with their target kinases being the CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Here, we present a comparative genomics analysis of the full complement of CBLs and CIPKs in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). We confirm the expression and transcript composition of the 10 CBLs and 25 CIPKs encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. Our identification of 10 CBLs and 30 CIPKs from rice indicates a similar complexity of this signaling network in both species. An analysis of the genomic evolution suggests that the extant number of gene family members largely results from segmental duplications. A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates an early diversification of separate branches within both gene families. These branches may represent proteins with different functions. Protein interaction analyses and expression studies of closely related family members suggest that even recently duplicated representatives may fulfill different functions. This work provides a basis for a defined further functional dissection of this important plant-specific signaling system.
22253446	Phosphorylation of calcineurin B-like (CBL) calcium sensor proteins by their CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) is required for full activity of CBL-CIPK complexes toward their target proteins.	2012	J Biol Chem	Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) represent a family of calcium sensor proteins that interact with a group of serine/threonine kinases designated as CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). CBL-CIPK complexes are crucially involved in relaying plant responses to many environmental signals and in regulating ion fluxes. However, the biochemical characterization of CBL-CIPK complexes has so far been hampered by low activities of recombinant CIPKs. Here, we report on an efficient wheat germ extract-based in vitro transcription/translation protocol that yields active full-length wild-type CIPK proteins. We identified a conserved serine residue within the C terminus of CBLs as being phosphorylated by their interacting CIPKs. Remarkably, our studies revealed that CIPK-dependent CBL phosphorylation is strictly dependent on CBL-CIPK interaction via the CIPK NAF domain. The phosphorylation status of CBLs does not appear to influence the stability, localization, or CIPK interaction of these calcium sensor proteins in general. However, proper phosphorylation of CBL1 is absolutely required for the in vivo activation of the AKT1 K(+) channel by CBL1-CIPK23 and CBL9-CIPK23 complexes in oocytes. Moreover, we show that by combining CBL1, CIPK23, and AKT1, we can faithfully reconstitute CBL-dependent enhancement of phosphorylation of target proteins by CIPKs in vitro. In addition, we report that phosphorylation of CBL1 by CIPK23 is also required for the CBL1-dependent enhancement of CIPK23 activity toward its substrate. Together, these data identify a novel general regulatory mechanism of CBL-CIPK complexes in that CBL phosphorylation at their flexible C terminus likely provokes conformational changes that enhance specificity and activity of CBL-CIPK complexes toward their target proteins.

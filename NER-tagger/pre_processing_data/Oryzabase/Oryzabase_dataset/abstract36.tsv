23943779	Application of an improved proteomics method for abundant protein cleanup: molecular and genomic mechanisms study in plant defense.	2013	Mol Cell Proteomics	High abundance proteins like ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) impose a consistent challenge for the whole proteome characterization using shot-gun proteomics. To address this challenge, we developed and evaluated Polyethyleneimine Assisted Rubisco Cleanup (PARC) as a new method by combining both abundant protein removal and fractionation. The new approach was applied to a plant insect interaction study to validate the platform and investigate mechanisms for plant defense against herbivorous insects. Our results indicated that PARC can effectively remove Rubisco, improve the protein identification, and discover almost three times more differentially regulated proteins. The significantly enhanced shot-gun proteomics performance was translated into in-depth proteomic and molecular mechanisms for plant insect interaction, where carbon re-distribution was used to play an essential role. Moreover, the transcriptomic validation also confirmed the reliability of PARC analysis. Finally, functional studies were carried out for two differentially regulated genes as revealed by PARC analysis. Insect resistance was induced by over-expressing either jacalin-like or cupin-like genes in rice. The results further highlighted that PARC can serve as an effective strategy for proteomics analysis and gene discovery.
23951364	The mechanism of antifungal action of a new polyene macrolide antibiotic antifungalmycin 702 from Streptomyces padanus JAU4234 on the rice sheath blight pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.	2013	PLoS One	Antifungalmycin 702, a new polyene macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomycespadanus JAU4234, has a broad antifungal activity and may have potential future agricultural and/or clinical applications. However, the mechanism of antifungal action of antifungalmycin 702 remains unknown. Antifungalmycin 702 strongly inhibited mycelial growth and sclerotia formation/germination of Rhizoctonia solani. When treated with antifungalmycin 702, the hyphae morphology of R. solani became more irregular. The membrane and the cellular organelles were disrupted and there were many vacuoles in the cellular space. The lesion in the plasma membrane was detected through the increase of membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation and leakage of cell constituents. In summary, antifungalmycin 702 may exert its antifungal activity against R. solani by changing the structure of cell membranes and the cytoskeleton and interacting with the organelles.
23943011	Effect of enhanced UV-B radiation and low-energy N⁺ ion beam radiation on the response of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation in rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings.	2013	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	To understand the effect of enhanced UV-B radiation and low-energy N(+) ion beam radiation on the response of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation in rice seedlings, Oryza sativa was exposed to three different doses of low-energy N(+) ion beam and enhanced UV-B alone and in combination. Enhanced UV-B caused a marked decline in some photosynthetic parameters (net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance) and photosynthetic pigments, whereas it induced an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, the rate of superoxide radical production, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). Enhanced UV-B also induced an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD], peroxidase (POD), and catalase [CAT]) and some nonenzymatic antioxidants such as proline. Under the combined treatment of enhanced UV-B and low-energy N(+) ion beam at the dose of 3.0 × 10(17) N(+) cm(-2), the activity of antioxidant compounds (SOD, POD, CAT, proline, and glutathione), photosynthetic pigments, and some photosynthetic parameters (net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance) increased significantly; however, the MDA content, H2O2 accumulation, and rate of superoxide radical production showed a remarkable decrease compared with the enhanced UV-B treatment alone. These results implied that the appropriate dose of low-energy N(+) ion beam treatment may alleviate the damage caused by the enhanced UV-B radiation on rice.
23945310	Characterization and fine mapping of a novel rice narrow leaf mutant nal9.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	A narrow leaf mutant was isolated from transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) lines carrying a T-DNA insertion. The mutant is characterized by narrow leaves during its whole growth period, and was named nal9 (narrow leaf 9). The mutant also has other phenotypes, such as light green leaves at the seedling stage, reduced plant height, a small panicle and increased tillering. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation is controlled by a single recessive gene. A hygromycin resistance assay showed that the mutation was not caused by T-DNA insertion, so a map-based cloning strategy was employed to isolate the nal9 gene. The mutant individuals from the F₂ generations of a cross between the nal9 mutant and Longtepu were used for mapping. With 24 F₂ mutants, the nal9 gene was preliminarily mapped near the marker RM156 on the chromosome 3. New INDEL markers were then designed based on the sequence differences between japonica and indica at the region near RM156. The nal9 gene was finally located in a 69.3 kb region between the markers V239B and V239G within BAC OJ1212_C05 by chromosome walking. Sequence and expression analysis showed that an ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit gene (ClpP) was most likely to be the nal9 gene. Furthermore, the nal9 mutation was rescued by transformation of the ClpP cDNA driven by the 35S promoter. Accordingly, the ClpP gene was identified as the NAL9 gene. Our results provide a basis for functional studies of NAL9 in future work.
23918958	High mature grain phytase activity in the Triticeae has evolved by duplication followed by neofunctionalization of the purple acid phosphatase phytase (PAPhy) gene.	2013	J Exp Bot	The phytase activity in food and feedstuffs is an important nutritional parameter. Members of the Triticeae tribe accumulate purple acid phosphatase phytases (PAPhy) during grain filling. This accumulation elevates mature grain phytase activities (MGPA) up to levels between ~650 FTU/kg for barley and 6000 FTU/kg for rye. This is notably more than other cereals. For instance, rice, maize, and oat have MGPAs below 100 FTU/kg. The cloning and characterization of the PAPhy gene complement from wheat, barley, rye, einkorn, and Aegilops tauschii is reported here. The Triticeae PAPhy genes generally consist of a set of paralogues, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b, and have been mapped to Triticeae chromosomes 5 and 3, respectively. The promoters share a conserved core but the PAPhy_a promoter have acquired a novel cis-acting regulatory element for expression during grain filling while the PAPhy_b promoter has maintained the archaic function and drives expression during germination. Brachypodium is the only sequenced Poaceae sharing the PAPhy duplication. As for the Triticeae, the duplication is reflected in a high MGPA of ~4200 FTU/kg in Brachypodium. The sequence conservation of the paralogous loci on Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 2 does not extend beyond the PAPhy gene. The results indicate that a single-gene segmental duplication may have enabled the evolution of high MGPA by creating functional redundancy of the parent PAPhy gene. This implies that similar MGPA levels may be out of reach in breeding programs for some Poaceae, e.g. maize and rice, whereas Triticeae breeders should focus on PAPhy_a.
23956122	RNA-guided genome editing in plants using a CRISPR-Cas system.	2013	Mol Plant	Precise and straightforward methods to edit the plant genome are much needed for functional genomics and crop improvement. Recently, RNA-guided genome editing using bacterial Type II cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease (Cas) is emerging as an efficient tool for genome editing in microbial and animal systems. Here, we report the genome editing and targeted gene mutation in plants via the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Three guide RNAs (gRNAs) with a 20-22-nt seed region were designed to pair with distinct rice genomic sites which are followed by the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The engineered gRNAs were shown to direct the Cas9 nuclease for precise cleavage at the desired sites and introduce mutation (insertion or deletion) by error-prone non-homologous end joining DNA repairing. By analyzing the RNA-guided genome-editing events, the mutation efficiency at these target sites was estimated to be 3-8%. In addition, the off-target effect of an engineered gRNA-Cas9 was found on an imperfectly paired genomic site, but it had lower genome-editing efficiency than the perfectly matched site. Further analysis suggests that mismatch position between gRNA seed and target DNA is an important determinant of the gRNA-Cas9 targeting specificity, and specific gRNAs could be designed to target more than 90% of rice genes. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas system can be exploited as a powerful tool for gene targeting and precise genome editing in plants.
23929733	Assessing the performance of the photo-acoustic infrared gas monitor for measuring CO(2), N(2)O, and CH(4) fluxes in two major cereal rotations.	2014	Glob Chang Biol	Rapid, precise, and globally comparable methods for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are required for accurate GHG inventories from different cropping systems and management practices. Manual gas sampling followed by gas chromatography (GC) is widely used for measuring GHG fluxes in agricultural fields, but is laborious and time-consuming. The photo-acoustic infrared gas monitoring system (PAS) with on-line gas sampling is an attractive option, although it has not been evaluated for measuring GHG fluxes in cereals in general and rice in particular. We compared N2 O, CO2 , and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from agricultural fields under the rice-wheat and maize-wheat systems during the wheat (winter), and maize/rice (monsoon) seasons in Haryana, India. All the PAS readings were corrected for baseline drifts over time and PAS-CH4 (PCH4 ) readings in flooded rice were corrected for water vapor interferences. The PCH4 readings in ambient air increased by 2.3 ppm for every 1000 mg cm(-3) increase in water vapor. The daily CO2 , N2 O, and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from the same chamber were not different in 93-98% of all the measurements made but the PAS exhibited greater precision for estimates of CO2 and N2 O fluxes in wheat and maize, and lower precision for CH4 flux in rice, than GC. The seasonal GC- and PAS-N2 O (PN2 O) fluxes in wheat and maize were not different but the PAS-CO2 (PCO2 ) flux in wheat was 14-39% higher than that of GC. In flooded rice, the seasonal PCH4 and PN2 O fluxes across N levels were higher than those of GC-CH4 and GC-N2 O fluxes by about 2- and 4fold, respectively. The PAS (i) proved to be a suitable alternative to GC for N2 O and CO2 flux measurements in wheat, and (ii) showed potential for obtaining accurate measurements of CH4 fluxes in flooded rice after making correction for changes in humidity.
23971749	Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, from practice to theory.	2013	Expert Rev Clin Immunol	Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is an allergic disease, probably non-IgE-mediated, with expression predominantly in the GI tract. The most characteristic symptom is repeated, debilitating vomiting. It occurs 2-6 h after ingestion of culprit food and is usually accompanied by pallor and lethargy. There may be diarrhea, and in 10-20% of cases, severe hypotension. These symptoms resolve completely within a few hours. The food most frequently involved is cow's milk, followed by rice, but many other foods may be involved. The prognosis is generally good in a few years. In this review the authors try to cope, with the help of some case histories, with the practical clinical aspects of FPIES. The authors also try to provide a management approach based on current knowledge, and finally, to point out the aspects of FPIES that are still controversial.
23857358	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases are pivotal components in pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling in plant immunity.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Innate immunity is generally initiated with recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are perceived by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to activation of a series of immune responses, including the expression of defense genes, ROS production and activation of MAP kinase. Recent progress has indicated that receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) are directly activated by ligand-activated PRRs and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in both Arabidopsis and rice. To suppress PTI, pathogens inhibit the RLCKs by many types of effectors, including AvrAC, AvrPphB and Xoo1488. In this review, we summarize recent advances in RLCK-mediated PTI in plants.
23828545	The Arabidopsis thaliana MYB60 promoter provides a tool for the spatio-temporal control of gene expression in stomatal guard cells.	2013	J Exp Bot	Plants have evolved different strategies to resist drought, of which the best understood is the abscisic acid (ABA)-induced closure of stomatal pores to reduce water loss by transpiration. The availability of useful promoters that allow for precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression in stomata is essential both for investigating stomatal regulation in model systems and for biotechnological applications in field crops. Previous work indicated that the regulatory region of the transcription factor AtMYB60 specifically drives gene expression in guard cells of Arabidopsis, although its activity is rapidly down-regulated by ABA. Here, the activity of the full-length and minimal AtMYB60 promoters is reported in rice (Oryza sativa), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), using a reporter gene approach. In rice, the activity of both promoters was completely abolished, whereas it was spatially restricted to guard cells in tobacco and tomato. To overcome the negative effect of ABA on the AtMYB60 promoter, a chimeric inducible system was developed, which combined the cellular specificity of the AtMYB60 minimal promoter with the positive responsiveness to dehydration and ABA of the rd29A promoter. Remarkably, the synthetic module specifically up-regulated gene expression in guard cells of Arabidopsis, tobacco, and tomato in response to dehydration or ABA. The comparative analysis of different native and synthetic regulatory modules derived from the AtMYB60 promoter offers new insights into the functional conservation of the cis-mechanisms that mediate gene expression in guard cells in distantly related dicotyledonous species and provides novel tools for modulating stomatal activity in plants.
23250723	M cell-targeting ligand and consensus dengue virus envelope protein domain III fusion protein production in transgenic rice calli.	2013	Mol Biotechnol	The spread of dengue (DEN) virus is becoming a major concern due to the possibility of primary infection with one of the four dengue serotypes (DEN 1-4) and secondary infection with other heterotypes, which can further aggravate clinical manifestations. A gene encoding consensus envelope protein domain III (cEDIII) of dengue virus with neutralizing activity against four dengue virus serotypes was fused to M cell-targeting peptide ligand (Co1) to increase its mucosal immunogenicity and was introduced into rice calli under the control of the inducible rice amylase 3D promoter expression system. The integration and expression of scEDIII-Co1 fusion gene in transgenic rice calli were confirmed by genomic DNA PCR amplification, Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. The deliveries of cEDIII-Co1 fusion proteins into mucosal immune inductive site (including M cells) were confirmed by in vitro and in vivo antigen uptake assays. These results showed that plant-produced M cell-targeting peptide ligand, Co1, fusion antigen proteins have the potential to be targeted to the mucosal immune system for improvement of immune responses.
23628887	Spatial and temporal variations in pentachlorophenol dissipation at the aerobic--anaerobic interfaces of flooded paddy soils.	2013	Environ Pollut	Pentachlorophenol (PCP) dissipation occurs naturally in flooded soils and although dissipation half-lives vary between soil profiles at the millimeter-scale the reason is poorly understood. Vertical variations of PCP dissipation were investigated in three typical Chinese paddy soils; Soil 1 (Umbraqualf), Soil 2 (Plinthudult) and Soil 3 (Tropudult). The soil depth was divided into a surface and a deep layer based upon different PCP dissipations in the surface layer of 40-93, 42-88 and 16-100% for Soils 1-3 respectively. In the deep layer, PCP was greatly dissipated in Soil 2, but much less in Soil 1 and Soil 3. Correlation analysis indicated that SO4(2-) and Fe(III) were negatively related to PCP dissipation. SO4(2-) and Cl(-) were highly mobile in the flooded soil profiles. Fe(III) reduction increased with increasing soil depth, and was inhibited by high SO4(2-) concentrations.
23847545	In silico investigation of the short QT syndrome, using human ventricle models incorporating electromechanical coupling.	2013	Front Physiol	INTRODUCTION: Genetic forms of the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) arise due to cardiac ion channel mutations leading to accelerated ventricular repolarization, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Results from experimental and simulation studies suggest that changes to refractoriness and tissue vulnerability produce a substrate favorable to re-entry. Potential electromechanical consequences of the SQTS are less well-understood. The aim of this study was to utilize electromechanically coupled human ventricle models to explore electromechanical consequences of the SQTS.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Rice et al. mechanical model was coupled to the ten Tusscher et al. ventricular cell model. Previously validated K(+) channel formulations for SQT variants 1 and 3 were incorporated. Functional effects of the SQTS mutations on [Ca(2+)] i transients, sarcomere length shortening and contractile force at the single cell level were evaluated with and without the consideration of stretch-activated channel current (I sac). Without I sac, at a stimulation frequency of 1Hz, the SQTS mutations produced dramatic reductions in the amplitude of [Ca(2+)] i transients, sarcomere length shortening and contractile force. When I sac was incorporated, there was a considerable attenuation of the effects of SQTS-associated action potential shortening on Ca(2+) transients, sarcomere shortening and contractile force. Single cell models were then incorporated into 3D human ventricular tissue models. The timing of maximum deformation was delayed in the SQTS setting compared to control.

CONCLUSION: The incorporation of I sac appears to be an important consideration in modeling functional effects of SQT 1 and 3 mutations on cardiac electro-mechanical coupling. Whilst there is little evidence of profoundly impaired cardiac contractile function in SQTS patients, our 3D simulations correlate qualitatively with reported evidence for dissociation between ventricular repolarization and the end of mechanical systole.
23832522	Zinc ameliorates copper-induced oxidative stress in developing rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2014	Protoplasma	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were treated with different concentrations of copper (Cu) either in presence or absence of zinc (Zn), and different events were investigated to evaluate the ameliorative effect of Zn on Cu stress. In presence of high Cu concentration, growth of both root and shoots were considerably reduced. Decline in elongation and fresh mass was observed in root and shoot. Zn alone did not show any considerable difference as compared to control, but when supplemented along with high concentration Cu, it prompted the growth of both root and shoot. After 7 days, root growth was 9.36 and 9.59 cm, respectively, at 200 and 500 μM of Cu alone as compared to 10.59 and 12.26 cm at similar Cu concentrations, respectively, in presence of Zn. Cu accumulation was considerably high after 7 days of treatment. In absence of Zn, significant accumulation of Cu was observed. Zn supplementation ameliorated the toxic impact of Cu and minimized its accumulation. Cu treatment for 1 and 7 days resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When Cu was added in presence of Zn, the H2O2 production in root and shoot was reduced significantly. The increase in H2O2 production under Cu stress was accompanied by augmentation of lipid peroxidation. In absence of Zn, Cu alone enhanced the malondialdehyde (MDA) production in both root and shoot after 1 and 7 days of treatment. The MDA content drastically reduced in root and shoot as when Zn was added during Cu treatment. The activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) were elevated under Cu stress both in root and shoot. Addition of Zn further stimulated the activities of these enzymes. Both ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contents were high under Cu stress either in presence or absence of Zn. The results suggests that Zn supplementation improves plant survival capacity under high Cu stress by modulating oxidative stress through stimulation of antioxidant mechanisms and restricts the accumulation of toxic concentrations of Cu.
23846670	Carotenoid deficiency impairs ABA and IAA biosynthesis and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Plant responses to abiotic stresses are coordinated by arrays of growth and developmental programs. Phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) play critical roles in developmental progresses and environmental responses through complex signalling networks. However, crosstalk between the two hormones at the biosynthesis level remains largely unknown. Here, we report that carotenoid-deficient mutants (phs1, phs2, phs3-1, phs4, and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice) were impaired in the biosynthesis of ABA and IAA. Under drought conditions, phs3-1 and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice showed larger stomata aperture and earlier wilting compared to the wild type at both seedling and panicle developmental stage. Interestingly, these carotenoid-deficient lines showed increased cold resistance, which was likely due to the combined effects of reduced IAA content, alleviated oxidative damage and decreased membrane penetrability. Furthermore, we found that IAA content was significantly declined in rice treated with fluridone (a carotenoid and ABA biosynthesis inhibitor), and expression of auxin synthesis and metabolism-related genes were altered in the fluridone-treated rice similar to that in the carotenoid-deficient mutants. In addition, exogenous IAA, but not ABA, could restore the dwarf phenotype of phs3-1 and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice. These results support a crosstalk between ABA and IAA at the biosynthesis level, and this crosstalk is involved in development and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.
23916816	Interest of rehabilitation in healing and preventing recurrence of ankle sprains.	2013	Ann Phys Rehabil Med	UNLABELLED: To assess the impact of rehabilitation on healing and recurrence rate of ankle sprain, 1year apart, 111 patients, who suffered an ankle sprain (67 men and 44 women; 17 mild sprains, 67 medium and 27 severe), were included by emergency physicians of four emergency rooms (ER) of Finistère. The physician was free to prescribe, or not, further investigations. He prescribed systematically to patients RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) protocol, put an ankle brace, and gave a prescription of standardized rehabilitation. The prescription was the same for the four ER. All patients were recalled to 1year. Of the 111 patients initially included, 21 patients were excluded for lack of response after three phone calls. In the end, 90 patients were assessable (56 men and 34 women), mean age 31.4±12.6years (range 15-55) at the time of initial trauma. Emergency physicians had diagnosed, initially, 16 mild sprains (17.8%), 56 medium sprains (62.2%) and 18 severe sprains (20%). Of the 90 patients, 73 patients have been rehabilitated (81.1%). Of the 44 accidents of everyday life, 31 were rehabilitated (70.5%). Of the 27 sports accidents, 25 were rehabilitated (92.6%). Of the 19 work-related injuries, 17 were rehabilitated (89.5%). There is no significant relationship between rehabilitation and no recurrence (P=0.45) nor between rehabilitation and full recovery of the ankle (P=0.59).

CONCLUSION: We find no association between rehabilitation and prevention of recurrence, nor between rehabilitation and healing of patients. However, our study is limited by the small size of the non-rehabilitated group.
23873414	The GreenCut: re-evaluation of physiological role of previously studied proteins and potential novel protein functions.	2013	Photosynth Res	Based on comparative genomics, a list of proteins present in the green algal, flowering and nonflowering plant lineages, but not detected in nonphotosynthetic organisms, was assembled (Merchant et al., Science 318:245-250, 2007; Karpowicz et al., J Biol Chem 286:21427-21439, 2011). This protein grouping, previously designated the GreenCut, was established using stringent comparative genomic criteria; they are those Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteins with orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana, Physcomitrella patens, Oryza sativa, Populus tricocarpa and at least one of the three Ostreococcus species with fully sequenced genomes, but not in bacteria, yeast, fungi or mammals. Many GreenCut proteins are also present in red algae and diatoms and a subset of 189 have been identified as encoded on nearly all cyanobacterial genomes. Of the current GreenCut proteins (597 in total), approximately half have been studied previously. The functions or activities of a number of these proteins have been deduced from phenotypic analyses of mutants (defective for genes encoding specific GreenCut proteins) of A. thaliana, and in many cases the assigned functions do not exist in C. reinhardtii. Therefore, precise physiological functions of several previously studied GreenCut proteins are still not clear. The GreenCut also contains a number of proteins with certain conserved domains. Three of the most highly conserved domains are the FK506 binding, cyclophilin and PAP fibrillin domains; most members of these gene families are not well characterized. In general, our analysis of the GreenCut indicates that many processes critical to green lineage organisms remain unstudied or poorly characterized. We have begun to examine the functions of some GreenCut proteins in detail. For example, our work on the CPLD38 protein has demonstrated that it has an essential role in photosynthetic function and the stability of the cytochrome b 6 f complex.
23936103	Unique and conserved microRNAs in wheat chromosome 5D revealed by next-generation sequencing.	2013	PLoS One	MicroRNAs are a class of short, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators in gene expression. miRNA analysis of Triticum aestivum chromosome 5D was performed on 454 GS FLX Titanium sequences of flow-sorted chromosome 5D with a total of 3,208,630 good quality reads representing 1.34x and 1.61x coverage of the short (5DS) and long (5DL) arms of the chromosome respectively. In silico and structural analyses revealed a total of 55 miRNAs; 48 and 42 miRNAs were found to be present on 5DL and 5DS respectively, of which 35 were common to both chromosome arms, while 13 miRNAs were specific to 5DL and 7 miRNAs were specific to 5DS. In total, 14 of the predicted miRNAs were identified in wheat for the first time. Representation (the copy number of each miRNA) was also found to be higher in 5DL (1,949) compared to 5DS (1,191). Targets were predicted for each miRNA, while expression analysis gave evidence of expression for 6 out of 55 miRNAs. Occurrences of the same miRNAs were also found in Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa genome sequences to identify syntenic miRNA coding sequences. Based on this analysis, two other miRNAs: miR1133 and miR167 were detected in B. distachyon syntenic region of wheat 5DS. Five of the predicted miRNA coding regions (miR6220, miR5070, miR169, miR5085, miR2118) were experimentally verified to be located to the 5D chromosome and three of them : miR2118, miR169 and miR5085, were shown to be 5D specific. Furthermore miR2118 was shown to be expressed in Chinese Spring adult leaves. miRNA genes identified in this study will expand our understanding of gene regulation in bread wheat.
23816039	Phytosterols, red yeast rice, and lifestyle changes instead of statins: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.	2013	Am Heart J	BACKGROUND: Many patients who refuse or cannot tolerate statin drugs choose alternative therapies for lipid lowering.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the lipid-lowering effects of phytosterol tablets and lifestyle change (LC) on top of red yeast rice (RYR) therapy in patients with a history of statin refusal or statin-associated myalgias.

DESIGN: A total of 187 participants (mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 154 mg/dL) took RYR 1800 mg twice daily and were randomized to phytosterol tablets 900 mg twice daily or placebo. Participants were also randomized to a 12-week LC program or usual care (UC). Primary end point was change in LDL-C at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. Secondary end points were effect on other lipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, weight, and development of myalgia.

RESULTS: Phytosterols did not significantly improve LDL-C at weeks 12 (P = .54), 24 (P = .67), or 52 (P = .76) compared with placebo. Compared with the UC group, the LC group had greater reductions in LDL-C at weeks 12 (-51 vs -42 mg/dL, P = .006) and 24 (-48 vs -40 mg/dL, P = .034) and was 2.3 times more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL (P = .004). The LC group lost more weight for 1 year (-2.3 vs -0.3 kg, P < .001). All participants took RYR and had significant decreases in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for 1 year when compared with baseline (P < .001). Four participants stopped supplements because of myalgia.

CONCLUSIONS: The addition of phytosterol tablets to RYR did not result in further lowering of LDL-C levels. Participants in an LC program lost significantly more weight and were more likely to achieve an LDL-C <100 mg/dL compared with UC.
23871874	A simple and sensitive biosensor strain for detecting toxoflavin using β-galactosidase activity.	2013	Biosens Bioelectron	In this study, we developed a simple and sensitive biosensor for the determination of toxoflavin (which is toxic to various plants, fungi, animals, and bacteria) in natural samples based on β-galactosidase activity. The proposed toxoflavin detection method for toxin-producing bacteria or toxin-contaminated foods is simple and cost effective. Burkholderia glumae, a species known to cause rice grain rot and wilt in various field crops, produces toxoflavin under the control of a LysR-type transcriptional regulator ToxR and its ligand toxoflavin. As the expression of toxoflavin biosynthetic genes requires toxoflavin as a co-activator of ToxR, a novel biosensor stain was constructed based on lacZ reporter gene integration into the first gene of the toxoflavin biosynthesis operon, toxABCDE of B. glumae. The biosensor was composed of a sensor strain (COK71), substrates (X-gal or ONPG), and culture medium, without any complex preparation process. We demonstrated that the biosensor strain is highly specific to toxoflavin, and can quantify relative amounts of toxoflavin compared with known concentrations of toxoflavin. The proposed method was reliable and simple; samples containing 50-500 nM of toxoflavin could be analyzed. More importantly, the proposed biosensor strain could identify toxoflavin-producing bacteria in real samples. The excellent performance of this biosensor is useful for diagnostic purposes, such as detecting toxoflavin-contaminated foods and environmental samples.
23873186	Homoeologous relationship of rye chromosome arms as detected with wheat PLUG markers.	2013	Chromosoma	Based on the similarity in gene structure between rice and wheat, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) system enabled us to design primer sets that amplify wheat genic sequences including introns. From the previously reported wheat PLUG markers, we chose 144 markers that are distributed on different chromosomes and in known chromosomal regions (bins) to obtain rye-specific PCR-based markers. We conducted PCR with the 144 primer sets and the template of the Imperial rye genomic DNA and found that 131 (91.0%) primer sets successfully amplified PCR products. Of the 131 PLUG markers, 110 (76.4%) markers showed rye-specific PCR amplification with or without restriction enzyme digestion. We assigned 79 of the 110 markers to seven rye chromosomes (1R to 7R) using seven wheat-rye (cv. Imperial) chromosome addition and substitution lines: 12 to 1R, 8 to 2R, 11 to 3R, 8 to 4R, 16 to 5R, 12 to 6R, and 12 to 7R. Furthermore, we located their positions on the short or long (L) chromosome arm, using 13 Imperial rye telosomic lines of common wheat (except for 3RL). Referring to the chromosome bin locations of the 79 PLUG markers in wheat, we deduced the syntenic relationships between rye and wheat chromosomes. We also discussed chromosomal rearrangements in the rye genome with reference to the cytologically visible chromosomal gaps.
23857260	Rice seed cultivar identification using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging and multivariate data analysis.	2013	Sensors (Basel)	A near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging system was developed in this study. NIR hyperspectral imaging combined with multivariate data analysis was applied to identify rice seed cultivars. Spectral data was exacted from hyperspectral images. Along with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), a novel machine learning algorithm called Random Forest (RF) was applied in this study. Spectra from 1,039 nm to 1,612 nm were used as full spectra to build classification models. PLS-DA and KNN models obtained over 80% classification accuracy, and SIMCA, SVM and RF models obtained 100% classification accuracy in both the calibration and prediction set. Twelve optimal wavelengths were selected by weighted regression coefficients of the PLS-DA model. Based on optimal wavelengths, PLS-DA, KNN, SVM and RF models were built. All optimal wavelengths-based models (except PLS-DA) produced classification rates over 80%. The performances of full spectra-based models were better than optimal wavelengths-based models. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be used for rice seed cultivar identification, and RF is an effective classification technique.
23827132	Cooked rice prevents hyperlipidemia in hamsters fed a high-fat/cholesterol diet by the regulation of the expression of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism.	2013	Nutr Res	Rice has many health-beneficial components for ameliorating obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. However, the effect of cooked rice as a useful carbohydrate source has not been investigated yet; so we hypothesized that cooked rice may have hypolipidemic effects. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cooked rice on hyperlipidemia and on the expression of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism. Golden Syrian hamsters were divided into 2 groups and fed a high-fat (15%, wt/wt)/cholesterol (0.5%, wt/wt) diet supplemented with either corn starch (HFD, 54.5% wt/wt) or cooked rice (HFD-CR, 54.5% wt/wt) as the main carbohydrate source for 8 weeks. In the HFD-CR group, the triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in the serum and liver were decreased, and the total lipid, total cholesterol, and bile acid levels in the feces were increased, compared with the HFD group. In the cooked-rice group, the messenger RNA and protein levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase were significantly downregulated; and the messenger RNA and protein levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase were upregulated. Furthermore, the expressions of lipogenic genes such as sterol response element binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 were downregulated, whereas the β-oxidation related genes (carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, acyl CoA oxidase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) were upregulated, in the cooked-rice group. Our results suggest that the hypolipidemic effect of cooked rice is partially mediated by the regulation of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism, which results in the suppression of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and the enhancement of cholesterol excretion and fatty acid β-oxidation.
23886623	Abscisic acid- and stress-induced highly proline-rich glycoproteins regulate root growth in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	In the root of rice (Oryza sativa), abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, salinity, or water deficit stress induces the expression of a family of four genes, REPETITIVE PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN (RePRP). These genes encode two subclasses of novel proline-rich glycoproteins with highly repetitive PX₁PX₂ motifs, RePRP1 and RePRP2. RePRP orthologs exist only in monocotyledonous plants, and their functions are virtually unknown. Rice RePRPs are heavily glycosylated with arabinose and glucose on multiple hydroxyproline residues. They are significantly different from arabinogalactan proteins that have glycan chains composed of arabinose and galactose. Transient and stable expressions of RePRP-green fluorescent protein reveal that a fraction of this protein is localized to the plasma membrane. In rice roots, ABA treatment increases RePRP expression preferentially in the elongation zone. Overexpression of RePRP in transgenic rice reduces root cell elongation in the absence of ABA, similar to the effect of ABA on wild-type roots. Conversely, simultaneous knockdown of the expression of RePRP1 and RePRP2 reduces the root sensitivity to ABA, indicating that RePRP proteins play an essential role in ABA/stress regulation of root growth and development. Moreover, rice RePRPs specifically interact with a polysaccharide, arabinogalactan, in a dosage-dependent manner. It is suggested that RePRP1 and RePRP2 are functionally redundant suppressors of root cell expansion and probably act through interactions with cell wall components near the plasma membrane.
23987811	Improving starch yield in cereals by over-expression of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase: expectations and unanticipated outcomes.	2013	Plant Sci	Significant improvements in crop productivity are required to meet the nutritional requirements of a growing world population. This challenge is magnified by an increased demand for bioenergy as a means to mitigate carbon inputs into the environment. Starch is a major component of the harvestable organs of many crop plants, and various endeavors have been taken to improve the yields of starchy organs through the manipulation of starch synthesis. Substantial efforts have centered on the starch regulatory enzyme ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) due to its pivotal role in starch biosynthesis. These efforts include over-expression of this enzyme in cereal plants such as maize, rice and wheat as well as potato and cassava, as they supply the bulk of the staple food worldwide. In this perspective, we describe efforts to increase starch yields in cereal grains by first providing an introduction about the importance of source-sink relationship and the motives behind the efforts to alter starch biosynthesis and turnover in leaves. We then discuss the catalytic and regulatory properties of AGPase and the molecular approaches used to enhance starch synthesis by manipulation of this process during grain filling using seed-specific promoters. Several studies have demonstrated increases in starch content per seed using endosperm-specific promoters, but other studies have demonstrated an increase in seed number with only marginal impact on seed weight. Potential mechanisms that may be responsible for this paradoxical increase in seed number will also be discussed. Finally, we describe current efforts and future prospects to improve starch yield in cereals. These efforts include further enhancement of starch yield in rice by augmenting the process of ADPglucose transport into amyloplast as well as other enzymes involved in photoassimilate partitioning in seeds.

23841539	The dual targeting ability of type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases arose early in land plant evolution.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Type II NAD(PH) dehydrogenases are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane of plants, fungi, protists and some primitive animals. However, recent observations have been made which identify several Arabidopsis type II dehydrogenases as dual targeted proteins. Targeting either mitochondria and peroxisomes or mitochondria and chloroplasts.

RESULTS: Members of the ND protein family were identified in various plant species. Phylogenetic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions were carried out for all proteins. All ND proteins from three model plant species Arabidopsis, rice and Physcomitrella were cloned as N- and C-terminal GFP fusions and subcellular localisations were determined. Dual targeting of plant type II dehydrogenases was observed to have evolved early in plant evolution and to be widespread throughout different plant species. In all three species tested dual targeting to both mitochondria and peroxisomes was found for at least one NDA and NDB type protein. In addition two NDB type proteins from Physcomitrella were also found to target chloroplasts. The dual targeting of NDC type proteins was found to have evolved later in plant evolution.

CONCLUSIONS: The functions of type II dehydrogenases within plant cells will have to be re-evaluated in light of this newly identified subcellular targeting information.
23902261	PAF104, a synthetic peptide to control rice blast disease by blocking appressorium formation in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating pathogen of rice and the main cause of crop losses worldwide. The successful management of blast disease caused by this fungus is a clear necessity. The synthetic peptide PAF104 has been characterized by its inhibition of M. oryzae appressorium formation on hydrophobic surfaces. Growth and the ability of conidia to germinate was not affected by PAF104, indicating the lack of toxicity on fungal conidia. The addition of the cutin monomer 1,16-hexadecanediol does not interfere with the inhibitory effect of PAF104 on in vitro hydrophobic surfaces. On the other hand, inhibition of appressorium formation by PAF104 was nullified by the exogenous addition of cAMP. Our results suggest that PAF104 affects the Pmk1 pathway by repression of the gene expression of MoMSB2, which encodes a sensing surface protein, and the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase MST11. The pathogenicity of M. oryzae was reduced after PAF104 treatment specifically blocking appressorium formation. Our results support PAF104 as a promising compound to control rice blast disease by blocking a specific target related to appressorium formation, a process essential for infection of rice leaves. Moreover, PAF104 is proposed as a lead compound to develop novel specific fungicides with improved properties.
23838485	Variations and constancy of mercury and methylmercury accumulation in rice grown at contaminated paddy field sites in three Provinces of China.	2013	Environ Pollut	Many paddy fields have been contaminated by mercury (Hg) in mining areas of China. In this study, twenty-six rice cultivars and three Hg contaminated paddy fields in different geographic regions were selected for field trials and aimed to investigate the variations and similarities in total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) accumulations in brown rice (seeds) across sites. Our results revealed widescale cultivar variation in THg (13-52 ng g(-1) at Wanshan) and MeHg (3.5-23 ng g(-1)) accumulation and %MeHg (17.7-89%) in seeds. The ability to translocate is an important factor in the levels of THg and MeHg in seed. Cultivar tended to stability in THg accumulation across sites. Some cultivars accumulated lower concentrations of both THg and MeHg in seeds at fields seriously contaminated by Hg. Present results suggest that appropriate cultivar selection is a possible way to reduce THg and MeHg accumulation in seeds of rice grown in Hg-contaminated regions.
23839078	Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of ankyrin-repeat gene family in maize.	2013	Dev Genes Evol	Members of the ankyrin repeats (ANK) gene family encode ANK domain that are common in diverse organisms and play important roles in cell growth and development, such as cell-cell signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the ANK gene family have been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice. However, little is known regarding the ANK genes in the entire maize genome. In this study, we described the identification and structural characterization of 71 ANK genes in maize (ZmANK). Then, comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of ZmANK genes family were performed including phylogenetic, domain and motif analysis, chromosomal localization, intron/exon structural patterns, gene duplications and expression profiling. Domain composition analyses showed that ZmANK genes formed ten subfamilies. Five tandem duplications and 14 segmental duplications were identified in ZmANK genes. Furthermore, we took comparative analysis of the total ANK gene family in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, ZmANKs were more closely paired with OsANKs than with AtANKs. At last, expression profile analyses were performed. Forty-one members of ZmANK genes held EST sequences records. Semi-quantitative expression and microarray data analysis of these 41 ZmANK genes demonstrated that ZmANK genes exhibit a various expression pattern, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmANK genes family. The results will present significant insights to explore ANK genes expression and function in future studies in maize.
23818197	Molecular diversity in rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta makes it highly effective against dynamic population of Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Funct Integr Genomics	Rice blast is one of the important diseases of rice which can be effectively managed by the deployment of resistance genes. Pi-ta is one of the major blast resistant genes effective against pathogen populations in different parts of India. We analysed allelic variants of Pi-ta from 48 rice lines selected after phenotyping of 529 rice landraces across three eco-geographical blast hot spot regions. Besides, Pi-ta orthologue sequences of 220 rice accessions belonging to wild and cultivated species of rice were also included in the study for a better evo-devo perspective of the diversity present in the gene and the selection pressures acting on this locus. We obtained high nucleotide variations (SNPs and insertion-deletions) in the intronic region. We also identified 64 haplotypes based on nucleotide polymorphism in these alleles. Pi-ta orthologues of Indian landraces were scattered in eight major haplotypes indicating its heterogenous nature. We identified a total of 47 different Pi-ta protein variants on the basis of deduced amino acid residues amongst the orthologues. Five unique and novel Pi-ta variants were identified for the first time in rice landraces exhibiting different reaction types against the Magnaporthe oryzae population. A high value of Pi(non/syn) was observed only in the leucine-rich domain of the alleles cloned from Indian landraces, indicating strong selective forces acting on this region. The detailed molecular analysis of the Pi-ta orthologues provides insights to a high degree of inter- and intraspecific relationships amongst the Oryza species. We identified rice landraces possessing the effective alleles of this resistance gene which can be used in future blast resistance breeding programmes.
23894667	Genetic dissection of yield and its component traits using high-density composite map of wheat chromosome 3A: bridging gaps between QTLs and underlying genes.	2013	PLoS One	Earlier we identified wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 3A as a major determinant of grain yield and its component traits. In the present study, a high-density genetic linkage map of 81 chromosome 3A-specific markers was developed to increase the precision of previously identified yield component QTLs, and to map QTLs for biomass-related traits. Many of the previously identified QTLs for yield and its component traits were confirmed and were localized to narrower intervals. Four novel QTLs one each for shoot biomass (Xcfa2262-Xbcd366), total biomass (wPt2740-Xcfa2076), kernels/spike (KPS) (Xwmc664-Xbarc67), and Pseudocercosporella induced lodging (PsIL) were also detected. The major QTLs identified for grain yield (GY), KPS, grain volume weight (GVWT) and spikes per square meter (SPSM) respectively explained 23.2%, 24.2%, 20.5% and 20.2% of the phenotypic variation. Comparison of the genetic map with the integrated physical map allowed estimation of recombination frequency in the regions of interest and suggested that QTLs for grain yield detected in the marker intervals Xcdo549-Xbarc310 and Xpsp3047-Xbarc356 reside in the high-recombination regions, thus should be amenable to map-based cloning. On the other hand, QTLs for KPS and SPSM flanked by markers Xwmc664 and Xwmc489 mapped in the low-recombination region thus are not suitable for map-based cloning. Comparisons with the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA sequence identified 11 candidate genes (CGs) for yield and yield related QTLs of which chromosomal location of two (CKX2 and GID2-like) was confirmed using wheat aneuploids. This study provides necessary information to perform high-resolution mapping for map-based cloning and for CG-based cloning of yield QTLs.
23888157	Rice gall dwarf virus exploits tubules to facilitate viral spread among cultured insect vector cells derived from leafhopper Recilia dorsalis.	2013	Front Microbiol	Rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV), a member of the family Reoviridae, causes repeated epidemics in rice fields in southern China. An RGDV isolate collected from Guangdong Province (southern China) is mainly transmitted by leafhopper vector Recilia dorsalis in a persistent-propagative manner. The infection by RGDV induces the formation of virus-containing tubules in the plant host and insect vector. In this study, we established continuous cell cultures of the leafhopper R. dorsalis to investigate the functional role of these tubules within the insect vector. Cytopathologic studies revealed that the tubules, which comprised viral non-structural protein Pns11 and contained viral particles, were able to protrude from the surface of cultured leafhopper cells. Tubule-like structures formed in non-host insect cells after the expression of Pns11 in a baculovirus system, suggesting that Pns11 was the minimal viral factor required for the formation of the tubules induced by RGDV infection. In cultured leafhopper cells, knockdown of Pns11 expression from RNA interference, induced by synthesized dsRNA from the Pns11 gene, abolished the formation of such tubules, preventing the direct cell-to-cell spread of RGDV without significant effects on viral multiplication. All these results show that RGDV exploits virus-containing tubules to facilitate viral spread among its insect vector cells.
23835917	Molecular profiling of genetic variability in domesticated groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) based on ISJ, URP, and DAMD markers.	2013	Biochem Genet	To detect DNA polymorphisms in the peanut, we screened 26 polymorphic primers using intron-exon splice junction (ISJ), universal rice primer (URP), and directed amplification of minisatellite region DNA (DAMD) techniques. Amplification of genomic DNA of 16 peanut accessions yielded 121 ISJ, 50 URP, and 25 DAMD fragments, of which 34, 25 and 16 were polymorphic, respectively. The range of polymorphism was 10.0-62.5%, averaging 27.7%, for ISJ; 20-80%, averaging 49.5%, for URP; and 28.6-50.0%, averaging 36.3%, for DAMD. In comparisons of multiplex ratio, average polymorphism information content, and marker index, the URP markers were relatively more efficient than ISJ and DAMD markers. Clustering results remained more or less the same with ISJ and URP markers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the study of the genetic diversity of the peanut using ISJ, URP, and DAMD markers.
23847632	kNACking on heaven's door: how important are NAC transcription factors for leaf senescence and Fe/Zn remobilization to seeds?	2013	Front Plant Sci	Senescence is a coordinated process where a plant, or a part of it, engages in programmed cell death to salvage nutrients by remobilizing them to younger tissues or to developing seeds. As Fe and Zn deficiency are the two major nutritional disorders in humans, increased concentration of these nutrients through biofortification in cereal grains is a long-sought goal. Recent evidences point to a link between the onset of leaf senescence and increased Fe and Zn remobilization. In wheat, one member of the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor (TF) family (NAM-B1) has a major role in the process, probably regulating key genes for the early onset of senescence, which results in higher Fe and Zn concentrations in grains. In rice, the most important staple food for nearly half of the world population, the NAM-B1 ortholog does not have the same function. However, other NAC proteins are related to senescence, and could be playing roles on the same remobilization pathway. Thus, these genes are potential tools for biofortification strategies in rice. Here we review the current knowledge on the relationship between senescence, Fe and Zn remobilization and the role of NAC TFs, with special attention to rice. We also propose a working model for OsNAC5, which would act on the regulation of nicotianamine (NA) synthesis and metal-NA remobilization.
23852165	Purification of ustiloxins A and B from rice false smut balls by macroporous resins.	2013	Molecules	Ustiloxins are cyclopeptide mycotoxins produced by Villosiclava virens, the pathogenic fungus of rice false smut disease. Both resins SP207 and SP700 were screened to show the best adsorption and desorption properties for ustiloxins A and B among 20 commercial macroporous resins. Dynamic adsorption and desorption tests were carried out to optimize the process parameters. The optimal conditions for adsorption of resin SP207 were a processing volume as 32 bed volumes (BV), pH value of 4, and flow rate of 2 BV/h; and those for desorption of resin SP207 were a 40:60 (v/v) ratio of ethanol to water, an eluent volume of 4 BV, pH value of 4 and a flow rate of 3 BV/h. The optimal conditions for adsorption of resin SP700 were a processing volume of 26 BV, pH value as 4, flow rate of 2 BV/h; and those for desorption of resin SP700 were a 30:70 (v/v) ratio of ethanol to water solution as eluent, volume of 4 BV, pH value as 4 and flow rate of 2 BV/h. Under the optimal conditions; the purities of ustiloxins A and B obtained with resin SP207 increased 23.06-fold and 19.78-fold, respectively; and their recoveries were 96.67% and 81.25%; respectively. Similarly; the purities of ustiloxins A and B obtained with resin SP700 increased 14.75-fold and 15.33-fold and their recoveries were 93.65% and 88.64%; respectively. The results show that adsorption and desorption on SP207 and SP700 resins are effective strategies for purifying ustiloxins A and B. The developed methods are beneficial for large-scale preparation and purification of ustiloxins A and B from rice false smut balls.

23887491	Role of rice heme oxygenase in lateral root formation.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Lateral roots (LRs) play important roles in increasing the absorptive capacity of roots as well as to anchor the plant in the soil. In rice, exposure to auxin, methyl jasmonate (MJ), apocynin, and CoCl2 has been shown to increase LR formation. This review provides evidence showing a close link between rice heme oxygenase (HO) and LR formation. The effect of auxin and MJ is nitric oxide (NO) dependent, whereas that of apocynin requires H2O2. The effect of CoCl2 on the LR formation could be by some other pathway unrelated to NO and H2O2. This review also highlights future lines of research that should increase our knowledge of HO-involved LR formation in rice.
23842755	Fungal endophyte Penicillium janthinellum LK5 improves growth of ABA-deficient tomato under salinity.	2013	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	An endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill) and identified as Penicillium janthinellum LK5. The culture filtrate (CF) of P. janthinellum significantly increased the shoot length of gibberellins (GAs) deficient mutant waito-c and normal Dongjin-beyo rice seedlings as compared to control. The CF of P. janthinellum contained GAs (GA3, GA4, GA7 and GA12). To assess endophyte-growth promoting and stress-tolerance potential, the CF along with the propagules of endophyte was applied to tomato-host and abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient mutant Sitiens plants under sodium chloride (NaCl) induced salinity stress. Sitiens plants had retarded growth under normal and salinity stress however its growth was much improved during P. janthinellum-association. The endophyte inoculation reduced the membrane injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation as compared to non-inoculated control under salinity. Endophyte-associated Sitiens plants have significantly higher catalase, peroxidase and glutathione activities as compared to control. Endophyte-infected host and Sitiens plants had low level of sodium ion toxicity and high calcium contents in its root as compared to control. P. janthinellum LK5 helped the Sitiens plants to synthesis significantly higher ABA and reduced the level of jasmonic acid to modulate stress responses. The results suggest that endophytes-association can resist salinity stress by producing gibberellins and activating defensive mechanisms of host and Sitiens plants to achieve improved growth.
23908658	Investigating the beneficial traits of Trichoderma hamatum GD12 for sustainable agriculture-insights from genomics.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Trichoderma hamatum strain GD12 is unique in that it can promote plant growth, activate biocontrol against pre- and post-emergence soil pathogens and can induce systemic resistance to foliar pathogens. This study extends previous work in lettuce to demonstrate that GD12 can confer beneficial agronomic traits to other plants, providing examples of plant growth promotion in the model dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana and induced foliar resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in the model monocot rice. We further characterize the lettuce-T. hamatum interaction to show that bran extracts from GD12 and an N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamindase-deficient mutant differentially promote growth in a concentration dependent manner, and these differences correlate with differences in the small molecule secretome. We show that GD12 mycoparasitises a range of isolates of the pre-emergence soil pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and that this interaction induces a further increase in plant growth promotion above that conferred by GD12. To understand the genetic potential encoded by T. hamatum GD12 and to facilitate its use as a model beneficial organism to study plant growth promotion, induced systemic resistance and mycoparasitism we present de novo genome sequence data. We compare GD12 with other published Trichoderma genomes and show that T. hamatum GD12 contains unique genomic regions with the potential to encode novel bioactive metabolites that may contribute to GD12's agrochemically important traits.
23902579	A comprehensive genetic study reveals a crucial role of CYP90D2/D2 in regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	New Phytol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential regulators of plant architecture. Understanding how BRs control plant height and leaf angle would facilitate development of new plant type varieties by biotechnology. A number of mutants involved in BR biosynthesis have been isolated but many of them lack detailed genetic analysis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a severe dwarf mutant, chromosome segment deleted dwarf 1 (csdd1), which was deficient in BR biosynthesis in rice. We isolated the mutant by screening a tissue culture-derived population, cloned the gene by mapping, and confirmed its function by complementary and RNAi experiments, combined with physiological and chemical analysis. We showed that the severe dwarf phenotype was caused by a complete deletion of a cytochrome P450 gene, CYP90D2/D2, which was further confirmed in two independent T-DNA insertion lines in different genetic backgrounds and by RNA interference. Our chemical analysis suggested that CYP90D2/D2 might catalyze C-3 dehydrogenation step in BR biosynthesis. We have demonstrated that the CYP90D2/D2 gene plays a more important role than previously reported. Allelic mutations of CYP90D2/D2 confer varying degrees of dwarfism and leaf angle, thus providing useful information for molecular breeding in grain crop plants.
23832334	Hypolipidemic effects of starch and γ-oryzanol from wx/ae double-mutant rice on BALB/c.KOR-Apoe(shl) mice.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	waxy/amylose-extender (wx/ae) double-mutant japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces resistant starch (RS) and a large amount of γ-oryzanol. Our previous study has shown the hypolipidemic effect of wx/ae brown rice on mice. To identify the functional constituents of the hypolipidemic activity in wx/ae rice, we prepared pure wx/ae starch and γ-oryzanol from wx/ae rice and investigated their effect on the lipid metabolism in BALB/c.KOR/Stm Slc-Apoe(shl) mice. The mice were fed for 3 weeks a diet containing non-mutant rice starch, non-mutant rice starch plus γ-oryzanol, wx/ae starch, or wx/ae starch plus γ-oryzanol. γ-Oryzanol by itself had no effect on the lipid metabolism, and wx/ae starch prevented an accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the liver. Interestingly, the combination of wx/ae starch plus γ-oryzanol not only prevented a TAG accumulation in the liver, but also partially suppressed the rise in plasma TAG concentration, indicating that wx/ae starch and γ-oryzanol could have a synergistic effect on the lipid metabolism.
23866314	Red yeast rice lowers cholesterol in physicians - a double blind, placebo controlled randomized trial.	2013	BMC Complement Altern Med	BACKGROUND: In recent years, red yeast rice (RYR) supplements have been marketed aggressively as a natural way to lower cholesterol; however, the large majority of commercially available products have not been studied according to current research standards.

METHODS: In a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial, 52 physicians and their spouses with a total cholesterol level of > 200 mg/dL were randomly allocated to receive a RYR extract or placebo for 8 weeks. As a primary outcome measure, we compared the before-after difference in lipid levels between both groups. As secondary outcome measures we looked at side-effects, CK elevation and a change in cardiovascular risk.

RESULTS: LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol was lowered with 36 mg/dL (22%) and total cholesterol with 37 mg/dL (15%) in the intervention group. This result was statistically significant as compared to the control group, in which no reduction in total cholesterol and LDL was observed (p < 0.001). There was no marked difference in CK (creatine kinase)-elevation or reported side-effects between study groups. In 5/31 participants in the intervention group, the lipid lowering effect resulted in lower cardiovascular risk as measured with SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation).

CONCLUSIONS: The RYR formulation under study was effective in lowering cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in this study population. RYR therapy may be an attractive and relatively well studied alternative in patients who are intolerant for statins or who have objections against pharmacological lipid lowering. However, consumers need to be warned that the actual content of commercially available preparations is not assured by governmental regulations, which raises effectiveness and safety issues.

23827162	Rice bran extract protects from mitochondrial dysfunction in guinea pig brains.	2013	Pharmacol Res	Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and recent evidence suggests that food ingredients can improve mitochondrial function. In the current study we investigated the effects of feeding a stabilized rice bran extract (RBE) on mitochondrial function in the brain of guinea pigs. Key components of the rice bran are oryzanols, tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are supposed to have beneficial effects on mitochondrial function. Concentrations of α-tocotrienol and γ-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (CEHC) but not γ-tocotrienol were significantly elevated in brains of RBE fed animals and thus may have provided protective properties. Overall respiration and mitochondrial coupling were significantly enhanced in isolated mitochondria, which suggests improved mitochondrial function in brains of RBE fed animals. Cells isolated from brains of RBE fed animals showed significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels after sodium nitroprusside (SNP) challenge indicating resistance against mitochondrial dysfunction. Experimental evidence indicated increased mitochondrial mass in guinea pig brains, e.g. enhanced citrate synthase activity, increased cardiolipin as well as respiratory chain complex I and II and TIMM levels. In addition levels of Drp1 and fis1 were also increased in brains of guinea pigs fed RBE, indicating enhanced fission events. Thus, RBE represents a potential nutraceutical for the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
23889895	Genome-wide identification, molecular cloning, expression profiling and posttranscriptional regulation analysis of the Argonaute gene family in Salvia miltiorrhiza, an emerging model medicinal plant.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Argonaute (AGO) is the core component of RNA-induced silencing complex. The AGO gene family has been analyzed in various plant species; however, there is no report about AGOs in the well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) plant, Salvia miltiorrhiza.

RESULTS: Through a genome-wide analysis, we identified ten SmAGO genes in S. miltiorrhiza. Full-length cDNAs of all SmAGOs were subsequently cloned and sequenced. These SmAGOs were characterized using a comprehensive approach. Sequence features, gene structures and conserved domains were analyzed by the comparison of SmAGOs and AtAGOs. Phylogenetic relationships among AGO proteins from S. miltiorrhiza, Arabidopsis and rice were revealed. The expression levels of SmAGO genes in various tissues of S. miltiorrhiza were investigated. The results implied that some SmAGOs, such as SmAGO1, SmAGO2, SmAGO3, SmAGO7 and SmAGO10, probably played similar roles as their counterparts in Arabidopsis; whereas the others could be more species-specialized. It suggests the conservation and diversity of AGOs in plants. Additionally, we identified a total of 24 hairpin structures, representing six miRNA gene families, to be miRNA precursors. Using the modified 5'-RACE method, we confirmed that SmAGO1 and SmAGO2 were targeted by S. miltiorrhiza miR168a/b and miR403, respectively. It suggests the conservation of AGO1-miR168 and AGO2-miR403 regulatory modules in S. miltiorrhiza and Arabidopsis.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to explore SmAGOs and miRNAs in S. miltiorrhiza. The results provide useful information for further elucidation of gene silencing pathways in S. miltiorrhiza.
23865888	The new species Enterobacter oryziphilus sp. nov. and Enterobacter oryzendophyticus sp. nov. are key inhabitants of the endosphere of rice.	2013	BMC Microbiol	BACKGROUND: Six independent Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, nitrogen-fixing rod-shaped isolates were obtained from the root endosphere of rice grown at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study.

RESULTS: The strains produced fatty acid patterns typical for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA as well as rpoB genes allocated the strains to two well-defined groups within the genus Enterobacter, family Enterobacteriaceae. The analyses indicated Enterobacter radicincitans, Enterobacter arachidis and Enterobacter oryzae to be the closest related species. An RpoB (translated) protein comparison supported the placement in the genus Enterobacter and the relatedness of our isolates to the aforementioned species. Genomic DNA:DNA hybridization analyses and biochemical analyses provided further evidence that the novel strains belong to two new species within the genus Enterobacter. The two species can be differentiated from each other and from existing enteric species by acid production from L-rhamnose and D-melibiose, decarboxylation of ornithine and utilization of D-alanine, D-raffinose L-proline and L-aspartic acid, among other characteristics. Members of both species revealed capacities to colonise rice roots, including plant-growth-promoting capabilities such as an active supply of fixed nitrogen to the plant and solubilisation of inorganic phosphorus, next to traits allowing adaptation to the plant.

CONCLUSIONS: Two novel proposed enterobacterial species, denominated Enterobacter oryziphilus sp. nov. (type strain REICA_142(T)=LMG 26429(T)=NCCB 100393(T)) and Enterobacter oryzendophyticus sp. nov. (type strain REICA_082(T)=LMG 26432(T) =NCCB 100390(T)) were isolated from rice roots. Both species are capable of promoting rice growth by supplying nitrogen and phosphorus.
23888162	Tolerance of anaerobic conditions caused by flooding during germination and early growth in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Front Plant Sci	Rice is semi-aquatic, adapted to a wide range of hydrologies, from aerobic soils in uplands to anaerobic and flooded fields in waterlogged lowlands, to even deeply submerged soils in flood-prone areas. Considerable diversity is present in native rice landraces selected by farmers over centuries. Our understanding of the adaptive features of these landraces to native ecosystems has improved considerably over the recent past. In some cases, major genes associated with tolerance have been cloned, such as SUB1A that confers tolerance of complete submergence and SNORKEL genes that control plant elongation to escape deepwater. Modern rice varieties are sensitive to flooding during germination and early growth, a problem commonly encountered in rainfed areas, but few landraces capable of germination under these conditions have recently been identified, enabling research into tolerance mechanisms. Major QTLs were also identified, and are being targeted for molecular breeding and for cloning. Nevertheless, limited progress has been made in identifying regulatory processes for traits that are unique to tolerant genotypes, including faster germination and coleoptile elongation, formation of roots and leaves under hypoxia, ability to catabolize starch into simple sugars for subsequent use in glycolysis and fermentative pathways to generate energy. Here we discuss the state of knowledge on the role of the PDC-ALDH-ACS bypass and the ALDH enzyme as the likely candidates effective in tolerant rice genotypes. Potential involvement of factors such as cytoplasmic pH regulation, phytohormones, reactive oxygen species scavenging and other metabolites is also discussed. Further characterization of contrasting genotypes would help in elucidating the genetic and biochemical regulatory and signaling mechanisms associated with tolerance. This could facilitate breeding rice varieties suitable for direct seeding systems and guide efforts for improving waterlogging tolerance in other crops.
23828614	Analysis of elite variety tag SNPs reveals an important allele in upland rice.	2013	Nat Commun	Elite crop varieties usually fix alleles that occur at low frequencies within non-elite gene pools. Dissecting these alleles for desirable agronomic traits can be accomplished by comparing the genomes of elite varieties with those from non-elite populations. Here we deep-sequence six elite rice varieties and use two large control panels to identify elite variety tag single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles (ETASs). Guided by this preliminary analysis, we comprehensively characterize one protein-altering ETAS in the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene of the IRAT104 upland rice variety. This allele displays a drastic frequency difference between upland and irrigated rice, and a selective sweep is observed around this allele. Functional analysis indicates that in upland rice, this allele is associated with significantly higher abscisic acid levels and denser lateral roots, suggesting its association with upland rice suitability. This report provides a potential strategy to mine rare, agronomically important alleles.
23952748	Molecular cloning and functional analysis of serotonin N-acetyltransferase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.	2013	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) catalyzes conversion of serotonin into N-acetylserotonin, which is a direct precursor for melatonin biosynthesis in all organisms. Molecular cloning of plant SNAT from rice led to a screening for SNAT homolog genes in other species. We identified a cyanobacterium SNAT-like gene (cSNAT) that showed 56% amino acid homology with the rice SNAT. To confirm whether cSNAT encoded SNAT enzyme activity, we expressed cSNAT DNA in Escherichia coli and purified the cSNAT protein as a C-terminal His-tagged form. The purified cSNAT protein exhibited SNAT enzyme activities, transferring the acetyl group into either serotonin or tryptamine substrates. The optimum temperature was 55°C, but it was still highly active at 70°C, suggesting that cSNAT is a thermotolerant enzyme. The Km and Vmax were 823 μm and 1.6 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The cSNAT gene is highly conserved in all cyanobacterial taxa and seems to be an origin of SNAT in higher plants. The thermotolerance of cSNAT suggests that melatonin plays a role in the response to high-temperature stress. Further analysis of this role of melatonin in higher plants is needed.
23844166	Development of low phytate rice by RNAi mediated seed-specific silencing of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase gene (IPK1).	2013	PLoS One	Phytic acid (InsP(6)) is considered to be the major source of phosphorus and inositol phosphates in most cereal grains. However, InsP(6) is not utilized efficiently by monogastric animals due to lack of phytase enzyme. Furthermore, due to its ability to chelate mineral cations, phytic acid is considered to be an antinutrient that renders these minerals unavailable for absorption. In view of these facts, reducing the phytic acid content in cereal grains is a desired goal for the genetic improvement of several crops. In the present study, we report the RNAi-mediated seed-specific silencing (using the Oleosin18 promoter) of the IPK1 gene, which catalyzes the last step of phytic acid biosynthesis in rice. The presence of the transgene cassette in the resulting transgenic plants was confirmed by molecular analysis, indicating the stable integration of the transgene. The subsequent T4 transgenic seeds revealed 3.85-fold down-regulation in IPK1 transcripts, which correlated to a significant reduction in phytate levels and a concomitant increase in the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi). The low-phytate rice seeds also accumulated 1.8-fold more iron in the endosperm due to the decreased phytic acid levels. No negative effects were observed on seed germination or in any of the agronomic traits examined. The results provide evidence that silencing of IPK1 gene can mediate a substantial reduction in seed phytate levels without hampering the growth and development of transgenic rice plants.
23836309	Infant exposures and development of type 1 diabetes mellitus: The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY).	2013	JAMA Pediatr	IMPORTANCE: The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is increasing worldwide, with the most rapid increase among children younger than 5 years of age.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between perinatal and infant exposures, especially early infant diet, and the development of T1DM.

DESIGN: The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) is a longitudinal, observational study.

SETTING: Newborn screening for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was done at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado. First-degree relatives of individuals with T1DM were recruited from the Denver metropolitan area.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1835 children at increased genetic risk for T1DM followed up from birth with complete prospective assessment of infant diet. Fifty-three children developed T1DM.

EXPOSURES: Early (<4 months of age) and late (≥6 months of age) first exposure to solid foods compared with first exposures at 4 to 5 months of age (referent).

MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Risk for T1DM diagnosed by a physician.

RESULTS: Both early and late first exposure to any solid food predicted development of T1DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04-3.51, and HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.26-7.24, respectively), adjusting for the HLA-DR genotype, first-degree relative with T1DM, maternal education, and delivery type. Specifically, early exposure to fruit and late exposure to rice/oat predicted T1DM (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.39, and HR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.36-6.11, respectively), while breastfeeding at the time of introduction to wheat/barley conferred protection (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.86). Complicated vaginal delivery was also a predictor of T1DM (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03-3.61).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the safest age to introduce solid foods in children at increased genetic risk for T1DM is between 4 and 5 months of age. Breastfeeding while introducing new foods may reduce T1DM risk.
23832371	OsJAR1 contributes mainly to biosynthesis of the stress-induced jasmonoyl-isoleucine involved in defense responses in rice.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Jasmonate plays key roles in plant growth and stress responses, as in defense against pathogen attack. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a major active form of jasmonates, is thought to play a pivotal role in plant defense responses, but the involvement of JA-Ile in rice defense responses, including phytoalexin production, remains largely unknown. Here we found that OsJAR1 contributes mainly to stress-induced JA-Ile production by the use of an osjar1 Tos17 mutant. The osjar1 mutant was impaired in JA-induced expression of JA-responsive genes and phytoalexin production, and these defects were restored genetically. Endogenous JA-Ile was indispensable to the production of a flavonoid phytoalexin, sakuranetin, but not to that of diterpenoid phytoalexins in response to heavy metal stress and the rice blast fungus. The osjar1 mutant was also found to be more susceptible to the blast fungus than the parental wild type. These results suggest that JA-Ile production makes a contribution to rice defense responses with a great impact on stress-induced sakuranetin production.
23871145	Isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting endophytic diazotrophic bacteria from Korean rice cultivars.	2014	Microbiol Res	We have isolated 576 endophytic bacteria from the leaves, stems, and roots of 10 rice cultivars and identified 12 of them as diazotrophic bacteria using a specific primer set of nif gene. Through 16S rDNA sequence analysis, nifH genes were confirmed in the two species of Penibacillus, three species of Microbacterium, three Bacillus species, and four species of Klebsiella. Rice seeds treated with these plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) showed improved plant growth, increased height and dry weight and antagonistic effects against fungal pathogens. In addition, auxin and siderophore producing ability, and phosphate solubilizing activity were studied for the possible mechanisms of plant growth promotion. Among 12 isolates tested, 10 strains have shown higher auxin producing activity, 6 isolates were confirmed as strains with high siderophore producing activity while 4 isolates turned out to have high phosphate-solubilizing activity. These results strongly suggest that the endophytic diazotrophic bacteria characterized in this study could be successfully used to promote plant growth and inducing fungal resistance in plants.
23845039	How protein targeting to primary plastids via the endomembrane system could have evolved? A new hypothesis based on phylogenetic studies.	2013	Biol Direct	BACKGROUND: It is commonly assumed that a heterotrophic ancestor of the supergroup Archaeplastida/Plantae engulfed a cyanobacterium that was transformed into a primary plastid; however, it is still unclear how nuclear-encoded proteins initially were imported into the new organelle. Most proteins targeted to primary plastids carry a transit peptide and are transported post-translationally using Toc and Tic translocons. There are, however, several proteins with N-terminal signal peptides that are directed to higher plant plastids in vesicles derived from the endomembrane system (ES). The existence of these proteins inspired a hypothesis that all nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted proteins initially carried signal peptides and were targeted to the ancestral primary plastid via the host ES.

RESULTS: We present the first phylogenetic analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana α-carbonic anhydrase (CAH1), Oryza sativa nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP1), and two O. sativa α-amylases (αAmy3, αAmy7), proteins that are directed to higher plant primary plastids via the ES. We also investigated protein disulfide isomerase (RB60) from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii because of its peculiar dual post- and co-translational targeting to both the plastid and ES. Our analyses show that these proteins all are of eukaryotic rather than cyanobacterial origin, and that their non-plastid homologs are equipped with signal peptides responsible for co-translational import into the host ES. Our results indicate that vesicular trafficking of proteins to primary plastids evolved long after the cyanobacterial endosymbiosis (possibly only in higher plants) to permit their glycosylation and/or transport to more than one cellular compartment.

CONCLUSIONS: The proteins we analyzed are not relics of ES-mediated protein targeting to the ancestral primary plastid. Available data indicate that Toc- and Tic-based translocation dominated protein import into primary plastids from the beginning. Only a handful of host proteins, which already were targeted through the ES, later were adapted to reach the plastid via the vesicular trafficking. They represent a derived class of higher plant plastid-targeted proteins with an unusual evolutionary history.
23583672	Influence of different types of nanomaterials on their bioaccumulation in a paddy microcosm: a comparison of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes.	2013	Environ Pollut	We investigated the environmental fate and bioaccumulation of TiO2 nanomaterials in a simplified paddy microcosm over a period of 17 days. Two types of TiO2 nanomaterials, nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) and nanotubes (TiO2-NT), were synthesized to have a negative surface charge. Ti concentrations in the environmental media (water, soil), crops (quillworts, water dropworts), and some lower and higher trophic organisms (biofilms, algae, plant-parasitic nematodes, white butterfly larva, mud snail, ricefish) were quantified after exposure periods of 0, 7, and 17 days. The titanium levels of the two nanomaterials were the highest in biofilms during the exposure periods. Bioaccumulation factors indicated that TiO2-NP and TiO2-NT were largely transferred from a prey (e.g., biofilm, water dropwort) to its consumer (e.g., nematodes, mud snail). Considering the potential entries of such TiO2 nanomaterials in organisms, their bioaccumulation throughout the food chain should be regarded with great concern in terms of the overall health of the ecosystem.
23727802	Strain improvement by overexpression of the laeA gene in Monascus pilosus for the production of monascus-fermented rice.	2013	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Monascus species have been used to produce fermented rice called Monascus-fermented rice (MFR). To improve a Monascus strain via activation of secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters for use in the production of MFR, we overexpressed an ortholog of the laeA gene, which encodes a global positive regulator of secondary metabolism under the control of the strong heterologous Aspergillus nidulans alcA promoter in Monascus pilosus. The OE::laeA transformant produced more SMs, including those not detected under uninduced conditions. MFR produced using the M. pilosus OE::laeA strain contained 4 times more monacolin K, a cholesterol-lowering agent, than MFR produced using the wild-type strain. In addition, pigment production was remarkably increased, and the antioxidant activity was increased as well. The results from this study suggest that Monascus species, which are important industrial fermentative fungi in Asia, can be improved for the production of functional foods by overexpressing the laeA gene.
23808777	Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, and cardiovascular disease risk factors: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.	2013	Arch Iran Med	BACKGROUND: Data available on the effect of quality (glycemic index [GI]) and quantity (glycemic load [GL]) of carbohydrates on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to examine the association between dietary GI, GL, and CVD risk factors among Tehranian adults, the participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.

METHODS: This population- based cross-sectional study was conducted on 2457 subjects (46% men and 54% women), aged 19 to 84 years. Dietary GI and GL were measured using a validated 168- item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles were measured.

RESULTS: The mean intakes of GI and GL were 68.3 and 244.8, respectively. Rice (26.6%) and bread (19.0%) were the major contributors to dietary GI and GL, respectively. Higher dietary GI and GL were associated with high intakes of carbohydrate, fiber, refined grain, fruits, simple sugar, snack, and desserts. After adjustment for lifestyle and dietary variables, a higher dietary GI was positively associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations among obese subjects. Dietary GL was positively associated with fasting and 2-h blood glucose among nonobese subjects, after adjustment for confounders.

CONCLUSION: Dietary GI and GL were associated with a few CVD risk factors, and body mass index levels may modulate these associations.
23824139	Multicolor and bright white upconversion luminescence from rice-shaped lanthanide doped BiPO4 submicron particles.	2013	Dalton Trans	In this paper, uniform rice-shaped lanthanide doped BiPO4 upconversion submicron particles have been successfully synthesized via a facile room-temperature co-precipitation reaction and subsequent calcination route. The morphology, phase transformation and upconversion luminescent properties of synthesized submicron particles (SMPs) were characterized by using different analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra. The transformation from hexagonal phase to monoclinic phase is crucial for upconversion luminescent properties due to the loss of water molecules in the lattice of hexagonal phase. With different variety and concentration of the dopant Ln(3+) (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) ions, the obtained samples present bright green, blue, and red upconversion emissions under a 980 nm continual wave laser diode excitation. Multicolor and bright white upconversion emissions have also been obtained by precisely adjusting the dopants concentration in the host lattice.
23879865	Five phylogenetically close rice SWEET genes confer TAL effector-mediated susceptibility to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2013	New Phytol	Bacterial plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas strains translocate transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into plant cells to function as specific transcription factors. Only a few plant target genes of TAL effectors have been identified, so far. Three plant SWEET genes encoding putative sugar transporters are known to be induced by TAL effectors from rice-pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We predict and validate that expression of OsSWEET14 is induced by a novel TAL effector, Tal5, from an African Xoo strain. Artificial TAL effectors (ArtTALs) were constructed to individually target 20 SWEET orthologs in rice. They were used as designer virulence factors to study which rice SWEET genes can support Xoo virulence. The Tal5 target box differs from those of the already known TAL effectors TalC, AvrXa7 and PthXo3, which also induce expression of OsSWEET14, suggesting evolutionary convergence on key targets. ArtTALs efficiently complemented an Xoo talC mutant, demonstrating that specific induction of OsSWEET14 is the key target of TalC. ArtTALs that specifically target individual members of the rice SWEET family revealed three known and two novel SWEET genes to support bacterial virulence. Our results demonstrate that five phylogenetically close SWEET proteins, which presumably act as sucrose transporters, can support Xoo virulence.
23832352	A eukaryotic molecular target candidate of roxithromycin: fungal differentiation as a sensitive drug target analysis system.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Roxithromycin (RXM), active against prokaryotes, has beneficial side effects such as anti-cancer activities on mammalian cells, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. We found that RXM inhibited the cellular differentiation of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Hence, we screened the targets of RXM by the T7 phage display method with fungal genomic DNA, and identified MoCDC27 (M. oryzae Cell Division Cycle 27) as a candidate. We generated mocdc27 knockdown mutants that the appressoria formation was less affected by RXM. A complemented mutant restored sensitivity against RXM to the level of the wild type. These results suggest that MoCDC27 was involved in the inhibition of appressorium formation by RXM, and that the complex of RXM-MoCDC27 affected another molecule involved in appressorium formation. The T7 phage display method with fungal genomic DNA can be a useful tool in the quest for drug target.
23867599	Genome-wide analysis and identification of stress-responsive genes of the NAM-ATAF1,2-CUC2 transcription factor family in apple.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, and CUC2) proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors. To date, little is known about the NAC genes in the apple (Malus domestica). In this study, a total of 180 NAC genes were identified in the apple genome and were phylogenetically clustered into six groups (I-VI) with the NAC genes from Arabidopsis and rice. The predicted apple NAC genes were distributed across all of 17 chromosomes at various densities. Additionally, the gene structure and motif compositions of the apple NAC genes were analyzed. Moreover, the expression of 29 selected apple NAC genes was analyzed in different tissues and under different abiotic stress conditions. All of the selected genes, with the exception of four genes, were expressed in at least one of the tissues tested, which indicates that the NAC genes are involved in various aspects of the physiological and developmental processes of the apple. Encouragingly, 17 of the selected genes were found to respond to one or more of the abiotic stress treatments, and these 17 genes included not only the expected 7 genes that were clustered with the well-known stress-related marker genes in group IV but also 10 genes located in other subgroups, none of which contains members that have been reported to be stress-related. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first genome-wide analysis of the apple NAC gene family, and the results should provide valuable information for understanding the classification and putative functions of this family.
23899096	Germinated brown rice and its bioactives modulate the activity of uterine cells in oophorectomised rats as evidenced by gross cytohistological and immunohistochemical changes.	2013	BMC Complement Altern Med	BACKGROUND: Germinated brown rice (GBR) is gaining momentum in the area of biomedical research due to its increased use as a nutraceutical for the management of diseases. The effect of GBR on the reproductive organs of oophorectomised rats was studied using the gross, cytological, histological and immunohistochemical changes, with the aim of reducing atrophy and dryness of the genital organs in menopause.

METHODS: Experimental rats were divided into eight groups of six rats per group. Groups 1, 2 and 3 (sham-operated (SH), oophorectomised without treatment (OVX) and oophorectomised treated with 0.2 mg/kg oestrogen, respectively) served as the controls. The groups 4,5,6,7 and 8 were treated with 20 mg/kg Remifemin, 200 mg/kg of GBR, ASG, oryzanol and GABA, respectively. All treatments were administered orally, once daily for 8 weeks. Vaginal smear cytology was done at the 7th week on all the rats. The weight and dimensions of the uterus and vagina were determined after sacrifice of the rats. Uterine and vaginal tissues were taken for histology and Immunohistochemical examinations.

RESULTS: GBR and its bioactives treated groups significantly increased the weight and length of both the uterus and the vagina when compared to Oophorectomised non-treated group (OVX-non-treated) (p < 0.05). Significant changes were observed in the ratio of cornified epithelial cells and number of leucocytes in the vaginal cytology between the oophorectomised non-treated and treated groups. There was also an increase in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells activity in the treated compared with the untreated groups histologically. Immunohistochemical staining showed specific proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the luminal and glandular epithelium of the treated groups, which was absent in the OVX-non-treated group. GBR improved the length and weight of the uterus and also increased the number of glandular and luminal cells epithelia of the vagina.

CONCLUSION: GBR and its bioactives could be a potential alternative in improving reproductive system atrophy, dryness and discomfort during menopause.
23775595	Control of rice embryo development, shoot apical meristem maintenance, and grain yield by a novel cytochrome p450.	2013	Mol Plant	Angiosperm seeds usually consist of two major parts: the embryo and the endosperm. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying embryo and endosperm development remains largely unknown, particularly in rice, the model cereal. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the rice GIANT EMBRYO (GE) gene. Mutation of GE resulted in a large embryo in the seed, which was caused by excessive expansion of scutellum cells. Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance. Map-based cloning revealed that GE encodes a CYP78A subfamily P450 monooxygenase that is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. GE is expressed predominantly in the scutellar epithelium, the interface region between embryo and endosperm. Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtCYP78A10, a GE homolog, also produced bigger seeds, implying a conserved role for the CYP78A subfamily of P450s in regulating seed development. Taken together, our results indicate that GE plays critical roles in regulating embryo development and SAM maintenance.
23893901	Molecular cloning and characterization of a ryanodine receptor gene in brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a distinct class of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel. The recent discovery of diamide insecticides has prompted studies on insect RyRs. However, information about the structure and function of insect RyRs is still limited. In this study, we isolated and characterized a full-length RyR cDNA (named NlRyR) from the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Homoptera: Delphacidae), a serious rice pest throughout Asia.

RESULTS: The composite NlRyR gene contains an open reading frame of 15 423 bp encoding a protein of 5140 amino acid residues, which shares high sequence identity (78-81%) with other insect homologues, except for two regions (IDR1: 4379-4732; IDR2: 1307-1529) with markedly low identity (44-48 and 38-41%, respectively). All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in the NlRyR protein, including the RyR domain as well as mannosyltransferase, IP3 R and RyR (pfam02815) (MIR) and RyR and IP3 R homology (pfam01365) (RIH) domains. Expression analysis of NlRyR revealed significant differences in mRNA expression levels among N. lugens developmental stages. Furthermore, three alternative splicing sites were identified in NlRyR, one of which forms the mutually exclusive exons A/B and is conserved in various insect species. Diagnostic PCR assays showed that the splice variant containing exon A was predominantly detected in all developmental stages.

CONCLUSION: NlRyR may play an important role in the control of developmental processes of N. lugens. Alternative splicing may generate the functional diversity of NlRyR. The results provided the basis for further structural and functional characterization of NlRyR.
23845012	On the cellular site of two-pore channel TPC1 action in the Poaceae.	2013	New Phytol	The slow vacuolar (SV) channel has been characterized in different dicots by patch-clamp recordings. This channel represents the major cation conductance of the largest organelle in most plant cells. Studies with the tpc1-2 mutant of the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana identified the SV channel as the product of the TPC1 gene. By contrast, research on rice and wheat TPC1 suggested that the monocot gene encodes a plasma membrane calcium-permeable channel. To explore the site of action of grass TPC1 channels, we expressed OsTPC1 from rice (Oryza sativa) and TaTPC1 from wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the background of the Arabidopsis tpc1-2 mutant. Cross-species tpc1 complementation and patch-clamping of vacuoles using Arabidopsis and rice tpc1 null mutants documented that both monocot TPC1 genes were capable of rescuing the SV channel deficit. Vacuoles from wild-type rice but not the tpc1 loss-of-function mutant harbor SV channels exhibiting the hallmark properties of dicot TPC1/SV channels. When expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells OsTPC1 was targeted to Lysotracker-Red-positive organelles. The finding that the rice TPC1, just like those from the model plant Arabidopsis and even animal cells, is localized and active in lyso-vacuolar membranes associates this cation channel species with endomembrane function.
23648762	Pt/Al₂O₃-catalytic deoxygenation for upgrading of Leucaena leucocephala-pyrolysis oil.	2013	Bioresour Technol	The aim of this study was to improve the quality of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks via catalytic deoxygenation using Pt/Al2O3 (Pt content=1.32% (w/w)). The minimum molar ratio of oxygen/carbon (O/C) at 0.14 was achieved when the amount of catalyst was 10% (w/w, bio-oil) and was applied under 4 bar of initial nitrogen pressure at 340°C for 1h. The reaction mechanism of the catalytic deoxygenation, in terms of reforming, water-gas shift and dehydration reactions, was proposed. To consider the effect of different biomass types on the efficiency of catalytic deoxygenation, the bio-oils obtained from the pyrolysis of sawdust, rice straw and green microalgae were likewise evaluated for direct comparison.
23900904	Artificial antigen synthesis and the development of polyclonal antibody-based immunoassay for citreoviridin determination.	2014	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Citreoviridin, a mycotoxin produced by Penicillium citreonigrum is a common contaminant of wide range of agri-products and detrimental to human and animal health. Therefore it is important to develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific immunoassay for citreoviridin detection. In this study, polyclonal antibody against citreoviridin was developed. For the preparation of citreoviridin-bovine serum albumin conjugate (CIT-BSA), hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbon atoms were oxidized by sodium periodate, so the product with reactive aldehyde residues was suitable for coupling with amine. Anti-citreoviridin polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing mice with CIT-BSA conjugate. The specificity and sensitivity of the polyclonal antibody was determined by indirect competitive ELISA. Results showed that the IC50 value of the polyclonal antibody was 0.56 μg/mL and no cross-reactivity was found between antiserum and other mycotoxins used in the experiment. The citreoviridin recovery rates by this polyclonal antibody were calculated through rice powder spiked by artificial citreoviridin. The recovery rates ranged were found from 70.5 ± 0.08 % to 94.7 ± 0.09% for inter-assay, and from 77.5 ± 0.04% to 95.4 ± 0.18% for intra-assay, which indicated that this polyclonal antibody could detect trace amount of CIT from the tested samples. Consequently, this study provided a specific and sensitive anti-citreoviridin polyclonal antibody, which made the determination of citreoviridin easier, quicker, and more accurate.
23865514	Theoretical study on the gas phase reaction of allyl alcohol with hydroxyl radical.	2013	J Phys Chem A	The complex potential energy surface of allyl alcohol (CH2CHCH2OH) with hydroxyl radical (OH) has been investigated at the G3(MP2)//MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. On the surface, two kinds of pathways are revealed, namely, direct hydrogen abstraction and addition/elimination. Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory and transition state theory are carried out to calculate the total and individual rate constants over a wide temperature and pressure region with tunneling correction. It is predicted that CH2CHOHCH2OH (IM1) formed by collisional stabilization is dominate in the temperature range (200-440 K) at atmospheric pressure with N2 (200-315 K at 10 Torr Ar and 100 Torr He). The production of CH2CHCHOH + H2O via direct hydrogen abstraction becomes dominate at higher temperature. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) has also been calculated for the title reaction. Moreover, the calculated rate constants and KIE are in good agreement with the experimental data.
23866310	Ethyl acetate extract of germinated brown rice attenuates hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells: role of anti-apoptotic, pro-survival and antioxidant genes.	2013	BMC Complement Altern Med	BACKGROUND: There are reports of improved metabolic outcomes due to consumption of germinated brown rice (GBR). Many of the functional effects of GBR can be linked to its high amounts of antioxidants. Interestingly, dietary components with high antioxidants have shown promise in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This effect of dietary components is mostly based on their ability to prevent apoptosis, which is believed to link oxidative damage to pathological changes in AD. In view of the rich antioxidant content of GBR, we studied its potential to modulate processes leading up to AD.

METHODS: The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of the ethyl acetate extract of GBR were compared to that of brown rice (BR), and the cytotoxicity of both extracts were determined on human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Assay. Based on its higher antioxidant potentials, the effect of the GBR extract on morphological changes due to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced oxidative damage in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was examined using inverted light microscope and fluorescence microscope by means of acridine orange-propidium iodide (AO/PI) staining. Also, evaluation of the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant and apoptotic genes was carried out using Multiplex Gene Expression System.

RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extract of GBR had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity compared to BR. The cytotoxicity results showed that GBR extract did not cause any damage to the human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells at concentrations of up to 20 ppm, and the morphological analyses showed that the GBR extract (up to 10 ppm) prevented H₂O₂-induced apoptotic changes in the cells. Furthermore, multiplex gene expression analyses showed that the protection of the cells by the GBR extract was linked to its ability to induce transcriptional changes in antioxidant (SOD 1, SOD 2 and catalase) and apoptotic (AKT, NF-Kβ, ERK1/2, JNK, p53 and p38 MAPK) genes that tended towards survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of our study showed that the ethyl acetate extract of GBR, with high antioxidant potentials, could prevent H₂O₂-induced oxidative damage in SH-SY5Y cells. The potential of GBR and its neuroprotective mechanism in ameliorating oxidative stress-related cytotoxicity is therefore worth exploring further.
23892148	Dye removal of activated carbons prepared from NaOH-pretreated rice husks by low-temperature solution-processed carbonization and H3PO4 activation.	2013	Bioresour Technol	A coupling of low-temperature sulfuric acid-assisted carbonization and H3PO4 activation was employed to convert NaOH-pretreated rice husks into activated carbons with extremely high surface area (2028 m(2) g(-1)) and integrated characteristics. The influences of the activation temperature and impregnation ratio on the surface area, pore volume of activated carbons were thoroughly investigated. The morphology and surface chemistry of activated carbons were characterized using N2 sorption, FTIR, XPS, SEM, TEM, etc. The adsorption capacity of resulting carbons obtained under optimum preparation conditions was systematically evaluated using methylene blue under various simulated conditions. The adsorption process can be well described by both Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second order kinetics models; and the maximum monolayer capacity of methylene blue was ca. 578 mg g(-1).
23883359	A nonribosomal peptide synthase containing a stand-alone condensation domain is essential for phytotoxin zeamine biosynthesis.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Dickeya zeae is the causal agent of rice foot rot and maize stalk rot diseases, which could cause severe economic losses. The pathogen is known to produce two phytotoxins known as zeamine and zeamine II which are also potent antibiotics against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria pathogens. Zeamine II is a long-chain aminated polyketide and zeamine shares the same polyketide structure as zeamine II, with an extra valine derivative moiety conjugated to the primary amino group of zeamine II. In this study, we have identified a gene designated as zmsK encoding a putative nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) by screening of the transposon mutants defective in zeamine production. Different from most known NRPS enzymes, which are commonly multidomain proteins, ZmsK contains only a condensation domain. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses showed that the ZmsK deletion mutant produced only zeamine II but not zeamine, suggesting that ZmsK catalyzes the amide bond formation by using zeamine II as a substrate to generate zeamine. We also present evidence that a partially conserved catalytic motif within the condensation domain is critical for zeamine production. Furthermore, we show that deletion of zmsK substantially decreased the total antimicrobial activity and virulence of D. zeae. Our findings provide a new insight into the biosynthesis pathway of zeamines and the virulence mechanisms of the bacterial pathogen D. zeae.
23889160	Microarray analysis of genes differentially expressed in melatonin-rich transgenic rice expressing a sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase.	2013	J Pineal Res	Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase led to an enhanced production of melatonin with various physiological effects, including seminal root elongation and resistance against cold and oxidative stress, which raises the possibility that melatonin may alter gene expression profiles in the transgenic rice. Therefore, we performed a microarray analysis to investigate the regulatory role of melatonin using the melatonin-rich transgenic rice. We identified 260 and 204 genes that were up- or downregulated in the melatonin-rich transgenic rice when compared with the wild type. Of these, 20 upregulated genes were identified in the seedlings of melatonin-rich rice at more than twice the levels in the wild type (P < 0.05), while 23 downregulated genes were also detected. The representative upregulated genes included caleosin, a Ca(2+) -binding oil-body surface protein involved in the degradation of lipids stored in oil bodies and various signaling proteins such as a cyclin F-box protein and leucine-rich repeat protein. In contrast, jasmonate-induced protein, senescence-associated protein, and polygalacturonase were included in the downregulated gene group. These results suggest that melatonin has an important role in modulating a wide range of gene expression, reflecting its pleiotropic physiological roles in plant growth and development.
23874922	Adaptation to pH and role of PacC in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	PLoS One	Fungi are known to adapt to pH partly via specific activation of the Pal signaling pathway and subsequent gene regulation through the transcription factor PacC. The role of PacC in pathogenic fungi has been explored in few species, and each time its partaking in virulence has been found. We studied the impact of pH and the role of PacC in the biology of the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Conidia formation and germination were affected by pH whereas fungal growth and appressorium formation were not. Growth in vitro and in planta was characterized by alkalinization and ammonia accumulation in the surrounding medium. Expression of the MoPACC gene increased when the fungus was placed under alkaline conditions. Except for MoPALF, expression of the MoPAL genes encoding the pH-signaling components was not influenced by pH. Deletion of PACC caused a progressive loss in growth rate from pH 5 to pH 8, a loss in conidia production at pH 8 in vitro, a loss in regulation of the MoPALF gene, a decreased production of secreted lytic enzymes and a partial loss in virulence towards barley and rice. PacC therefore plays a significant role in M. oryzae's biology, and pH is revealed as one component at work during interaction between the fungus and its host plants.
23890351	Red yeast rice improves lipid pattern, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and vascular remodeling parameters in moderately hypercholesterolemic Italian subjects.	2013	Nutr Res	Despite a recent health claim by the European Agency on Food Safety, the effect of high doses of dietary monacolin supplements from red yeast rice on cholesterolemia has not been tested in Italian subjects. Our aim via a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to test if a short-term treatment with 10 mg monacolins could improve lipid pattern, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and vascular remodeling biomarkers in a small cohort of Mediterranean subjects. Thus, 25 healthy, mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were enrolled, and after 4 weeks of a stabilization diet, subjects were randomized to the sequence placebo-washout-monacolins or monacolins-washout-placebo, with each period being 4 weeks long. At each study step, a complete lipid pattern, safety parameters, hs-CRP, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 levels were measured. When compared to the placebo group, monacolins-treated patients experienced a more favorable percent change in total cholesterol (-12.45%, 95% CI -16.19 to -8.71), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-21.99%, 95% CI -26.63 to -17.36), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-14.67%, 95% CI -19.22 to -10.11), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (-28.05%, 95% CI -35.18 to -20.93), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (-27.19%, 95% CI -36.21 to -18.15), and hs-CRP (-23.77%, 95% CI -30.54 to -17.01). No significant differences were observed in regards to triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and safety parameters. On the basis of our data, we demonstrate that a 10-mg monacolin nutraceutical appears to safely reduce cholesterolemia, hs-CRP, and markers of vascular remodeling in Italian subjects. These results have to be confirmed in larger patient samples and longer studies.
23830033	Multiple effects of swelling by sodium bicarbonate after delignification on enzymatic saccharification of rice straw.	2013	J Biosci Bioeng	The multiple effects of pretreatments by chemical delignification using acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) and swelling using sodium bicarbonate (SB) for enzymatic saccharification of rice straw in bioethanol production have been investigated in this study. The treatment with the combination of ASC three times (3× ASC) first and SB later resulted in the significant reduction in Klason lignin content up to 90% (wt./wt.). By the saccharification of the pretreated rice straw with cellulase enzymes, it was confirmed that SB treatment was an important step in the pretreatment process not only to disintegrate the cellulose structure but also to facilitate the amorphization of the crystalline cellulose as well as the extended removal of integrated lignin. Furthermore, FTIR analyses revealed that the crystal type of cellulose appeared to be changed from type I to type II by SB treatment, thereby increasing the cellulose surface area and making it more accessible to the cellulase enzyme. Conversion rate to sugar was remarkably increased when 3× ASC + SB treatments were applied to untreated rice straw, even though the saccharification of the treated rice straw was performed at a low enzyme loading (1/100, wt.-enzymes/wt.-substrate). Conclusively, rice straw could be saccharified at high yield in short time at low cellulase loading, enables the enzymatic saccharification to be more feasible for practical bioethanol production using rice straw as a substrate.
23800416	Prenatal methylmercury exposure through maternal rice ingestion: insights from a feasibility pilot in Guizhou Province, China.	2013	Environ Pollut	Maternal hair and blood were investigated as biomarkers for prenatal methylmercury (MeHg) exposure among seventeen mothers recruited at parturition in Wanshan, Guizhou Province, China, where rice ingestion was the primary MeHg exposure pathway and atmospheric mercury (Hg) levels were elevated. For all three trimesters (n = 51), hair total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.27 to 4.9 μg/g (median: 0.96 μg/g) and 0.077 to 2.3 μg/g (median: 0.43 μg/g), respectively, while blood THg levels ranged from 1.7 to 11 μg/L (median: 3.0 μg/L, n = 17). Despite adequate hair washing procedures, median %MeHg (of THg) was 37% (range: 14-89%, n = 51), indicating exogenous inorganic Hg(II) contamination or incorporation of elemental Hg (Hg(o)) into the hair shaft were important. Rice MeHg levels (n = 17) were highly correlated with blood THg (r(2) = 0.66) compared to hair MeHg (r(2) = 0.31) (when variables were log10-transformed), suggesting blood THg was a more preferable biomarker for prenatal MeHg exposure within this population.
23762267	A computational systems biology study for understanding salt tolerance mechanism in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Salinity is one of the most common abiotic stresses in agriculture production. Salt tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa) is an important trait controlled by various genes. The mechanism of rice salt tolerance, currently with limited understanding, is of great interest to molecular breeding in improving grain yield. In this study, a gene regulatory network of rice salt tolerance is constructed using a systems biology approach with a number of novel computational methods. We developed an improved volcano plot method in conjunction with a new machine-learning method for gene selection based on gene expression data and applied the method to choose genes related to salt tolerance in rice. The results were then assessed by quantitative trait loci (QTL), co-expression and regulatory binding motif analysis. The selected genes were constructed into a number of network modules based on predicted protein interactions including modules of phosphorylation activity, ubiquity activity, and several proteinase activities such as peroxidase, aspartic proteinase, glucosyltransferase, and flavonol synthase. All of these discovered modules are related to the salt tolerance mechanism of signal transduction, ion pump, abscisic acid mediation, reactive oxygen species scavenging and ion sequestration. We also predicted the three-dimensional structures of some crucial proteins related to the salt tolerance QTL for understanding the roles of these proteins in the network. Our computational study sheds some new light on the mechanism of salt tolerance and provides a systems biology pipeline for studying plant traits in general.
23811121	Divergences in morphological changes and antioxidant responses in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive rice seedlings after salt stress.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Salinization plays a primary role in soil degradation and reduced agricultural productivity. We observed that salt stress reversed photosynthesis and reactive oxygen scavenging responses in leaves or roots of two rice cultivars, a salt-tolerant cultivar Pokkali and a salt-sensitive cultivar IR-29. Salt treatment (100 mM NaCl) on IR-29 decreased the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), thereby inhibiting photosynthetic activity. By contrast, the salt treatment on Pokkali had the converse effect on Fv/Fm and qP, while increasing the nonphotochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ), thereby favoring photosynthetic activity. Notably, chloroplast or root cells in Pokkali maintained their ultrastructures largely intact under the salt stress, but, IR-29 showed severe disintegration of existing grana stacks, increase of plastoglobuli, and swelling of thylakoidal membranes in addition to collapsed vascular region in adventitious roots. Pokkali is known to have higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-scavenging enzyme activities in non-treated seedlings, including ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase activities. However, these enzymatic activities were induced to a greater extent in IR-29 by the salt stress. While the level of endogenous H2O2 was lower in Pokkali than in IR-29, it was reversed upon the salt treatment. Nevertheless, the decreased amount of H2O2 in IR-29 upon the salt stress didn't result in a high scavenging activity of total cell extracts for H2O2, as well as O2(·-) and (·)OH species. The present study suggests that the tolerance to the moderate salinity in Pokkali derives largely from the constitutively maintained antioxidant enzymatic activities as well as the induced antioxidant enzyme system.
23783412	Identification and characterization of a novel chloroplast/mitochondria co-localized glutathione reductase 3 involved in salt stress response in rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Glutathione reductases (GRs) are important components of the antioxidant machinery that plants use to respond against abiotic stresses. In rice, one cytosolic and two chloroplastic GR isoforms have been identified. In this work, we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA encoding OsGR3, a chloroplast-localized GR that up to now was considered as a non-functional enzyme because of assumed lack of N-terminal conserved domains. The expression of OsGR3 in E. coli validated that it can be translated as a protein with GR activity. OsGR3 shows 76 and 53 % identity with OsGR1 (chloroplastic) and OsGR2 (cytosolic), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 chloroplastic GRs in Poaceae species, including rice, sorghum and brachypodium, but only one chloroplastic GR in dicots. A plastid transit peptide is located at the N terminus of OsGR3, and genetic transformation of rice with a GR3-GFP fusion construct further confirmed its localization in chloroplasts. Furthermore, OsGR1 and OsGR3 are also targeted to mitochondria, which suggest a combined antioxidant mechanism in both chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, both isoforms showed a distinct response to salinity: the expression of OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was induced by salt stress. In addition, the transcript level of OsGR3 was greatly increased with salicylic acid treatment but was not significantly affected by methyl jasmonate, dehydration or heat shock stress. Our results provide new clues about the possible roles of functional OsGR3 in salt stress and biotic stress tolerance.
23748783	Evaluation of three RT-qPCR-based miRNA detection methods using seven rice miRNAs.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Three frequently-used reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based miRNA detection methods, stem-loop RT-qPCR, poly(A)-tailing RT-qPCR, and miQPCR, were evaluated using seven selected rice miRNAs. The results revealed that miRNA abundance and sequence characteristics can affect capability of detection. The stem-loop amplification technique detected highly and moderately abundant miRNAs. The poly(A)-tailing method detected both highly abundant and sparsely present miRNAs, but failed to detect miRNAs with a hairpin structure. Only a few miRNAs were detectable by the miQPCR method. We suggest that a combination of methods should be used for reliable quantitative investigation of miRNAs.
23807744	Genetic structure of rice black-streaked dwarf virus populations in China.	2013	Arch Virol	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus belonging to the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae. The genome of RBSDV consists of ten dsRNA segments. Although RBSDV has caused significant economic losses to rice and maize production in the past few years in China, its molecular diversity and evolution remain largely unknown. To elucidate the factor(s) underlying the evolution of RBSDV, we determined segment 8 (S8; carrying ORF8 encoding the minor core capsid protein) sequences of 101 samples and segment 10 (S10; carrying ORF10 encoding the major capsid protein) sequences of 103 samples. The results show that both ORF8 and ORF10 are under negative selection. The S8 of three isolates and S10 of two isolates are recombinants. The RBSDV population in China can be classified into three groups according to S8 sequences or into two groups according to S10 sequences, irrespective of host or geographical origin. Of the RBSDV isolates with both S8 and S10 sequences available, 17 are between-group reassortants and 30 are between-subgroup reassortants. The RBSDV subpopulations from different geographical regions and hosts show frequent gene flow within or between subpopulations. The RBSDV population from maize is in a state of expansion. In this study, no new emergent population was detected. Taken together, the results indicate that, in addition to recombination and negative selection, reassortment and gene flow are important factors that drive evolution of RBSDV in China.
23748708	qLTG-9, a stable quantitative trait locus for low-temperature germination in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Low-temperature germination (LTG) is an important agronomic trait for direct seeding of rice in temperate regions of East Asia. To dissect the genetic control of LTG, we constructed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross of japonica variety USSR5 and indica variety N22. Three putative QTL involved in LTG were detected and named qLTG-7, qLTG-9 and qLTG-12. They explained 9.5, 12.12 and 7.08 % of the phenotypic variation, respectively, and the alleles from USSR5 enhanced LTG. A set of advanced backcross lines selected for the presence of qLTG-9 (with the biggest contribution of the three QTL), by both linked markers and phenotype, was used to validate qLTG-9 in different generations, years and locations. A near-isogenic line in USSR5 background with a qLTG-9 insertion from N22 had retarded germination under low-temperature conditions. Finally, qLTG-9 was fine mapped between markers L9-25D and ID-1, to a 72.3-kb region in chromosome 9, which in the Nipponbare genome contains five predicted genes. This result provides a springboard for map-based cloning of qLTG-9 and is helpful in understanding the mechanism of seed germination under low-temperature conditions.
23810669	Separation and characterization of the immunostimulatory components in unpolished rice black vinegar (kurozu).	2013	J Biosci Bioeng	Unpolished rice black vinegar (kurozu), a traditional Japanese vinegar, is considered to have beneficial health effects. Kurozu is produced via a static fermentation process involving the saccharification of rice by Aspergillus oryzae, alcohol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria such as Acetobacter pasteurianus. Since this process requires about 6 months' fermentation and then over a year of aging, most of these organisms die during the production process and so microbial components, which might stimulate the innate immune system, are expected to be present in the vinegar. In this study, we investigated whether microbial components are present in kurozu, and after confirming this we characterized their immunostimulatory activities. Lyophilized kurozu stimulated murine spleen cells to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, at least in part, via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and the Nod-like receptors NOD1 and 2. The active components associated with TLR2 activation were concentrated by Triton X-114-water phase partitioning and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Octyl Sepharose. TLR4-activating components were also enriched by these methods. The concentrated preparation stimulated murine spleen cells to produce TNF-α and interferon (IFN)-γ. These results indicate that long-term fermented kurozu contains immunostimulatory components and that the TLR2 and TLR4-activating immunostimulatory components of kurozu are hydrophobic. These components might be responsible for the beneficial health effects of kurozu.
23825955	Deciphering the cryptic genome: genome-wide analyses of the rice pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi reveal complex regulation of secondary metabolism and novel metabolites.	2013	PLoS Pathog	The fungus Fusarium fujikuroi causes "bakanae" disease of rice due to its ability to produce gibberellins (GAs), but it is also known for producing harmful mycotoxins. However, the genetic capacity for the whole arsenal of natural compounds and their role in the fungus' interaction with rice remained unknown. Here, we present a high-quality genome sequence of F. fujikuroi that was assembled into 12 scaffolds corresponding to the 12 chromosomes described for the fungus. We used the genome sequence along with ChIP-seq, transcriptome, proteome, and HPLC-FTMS-based metabolome analyses to identify the potential secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and to examine their regulation in response to nitrogen availability and plant signals. The results indicate that expression of most but not all gene clusters correlate with proteome and ChIP-seq data. Comparison of the F. fujikuroi genome to those of six other fusaria revealed that only a small number of gene clusters are conserved among these species, thus providing new insights into the divergence of secondary metabolism in the genus Fusarium. Noteworthy, GA biosynthetic genes are present in some related species, but GA biosynthesis is limited to F. fujikuroi, suggesting that this provides a selective advantage during infection of the preferred host plant rice. Among the genome sequences analyzed, one cluster that includes a polyketide synthase gene (PKS19) and another that includes a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene (NRPS31) are unique to F. fujikuroi. The metabolites derived from these clusters were identified by HPLC-FTMS-based analyses of engineered F. fujikuroi strains overexpressing cluster genes. In planta expression studies suggest a specific role for the PKS19-derived product during rice infection. Thus, our results indicate that combined comparative genomics and genome-wide experimental analyses identified novel genes and secondary metabolites that contribute to the evolutionary success of F. fujikuroi as a rice pathogen.
23794015	Distribution of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana in rice ecosystems and its effect on soil enzymes.	2013	Curr Microbiol	Fungal entomopathogens, especially Beauveria bassiana, are often studied within the context of their use in biological pest control; however, there is limited knowledge of their distributions in host plants and soil ecosystem. We examined the distribution of B. bassiana and its influence on rice plants and paddy soils. B. bassiana could only be detected on the foliar surfaces of rice plants within 15 days under Bb-4 (7.5 × 10(4) conidia/mL) and Bb-7 (7.5 × 10(7) conidia/mL) treatments. The endophytic colonization of B. bassiana could not be found in stems, roots, or seeds of rice plants under Bb-4 and Bb-7 treatments. The fungus was found only in the leaves of rice plants under Bb-4 and Bb-7 treatments at 15 days after inoculation. Moreover, B. bassiana was absent from paddy soils under Bb-4 and Bb-7 treatments at all times. Enzyme activity (urease and phosphatase) in the paddy soils of Bb-4 and Bb-7 treatments showed no significant difference from the control. It is possible that B. bassiana was not able to colonize paddy soil. Detailed understanding of distribution and ecological interactions of B. bassiana is helpful for understanding and predicting the effects of fungal entomopathogens on host populations, and the interactions among fungal entomopathogens and other organisms in the community.
23816581	Effects of environmental lead pollution on blood lead and sex hormone levels among occupationally exposed group in an E-waste dismantling area.	2013	Biomed Environ Sci	OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of environmental multi-media lead pollution on blood lead and sex hormone levels among lead exposed males engaged in E-waste dismantling, and the correlation between confounding factors and sex hormone levels.

METHODS: An E-waste dismantling area in Taizhou of Zhejiang Province was selected as the research site. One hundred and fifty two samples were collected from the groundwater, soil, rice, corn, chicken, and pork in the dismantling area. The effects of the multi-media lead pollution on the male blood lead and sex hormone levels of FSH, LH, and T, as well as the correlation with confounding factors, were studied.

RESULTS: The blood lead concentrations in the males aged under 31, from 31 to 45 and from 46 to 60 were 98.55, 100.23, and 101.45 μg/L, respectively. Of all the environmental media lead exposures, the groundwater, rice and soil were main contributing factors to the lead accumulation in humans. FSH and LH levels increased with the age while the T levels decreased with the age instead. There was a significant correlation between the FSH and LH levels and wearing masks.

CONCLUSION: There was correlation between the FSH, LH, and T levels, and the mean values of lead concentrations in environmental media, and the sex hormone levels were correlated with the confounding factor of wearing masks.
23853510	Genetic analysis and fine mapping of a semi-dwarf gene in a centromeric region in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Breed Sci	Superior plant architecture is a key means of enhancing yield potential in high yielding varieties. A newly identified recessive gene, named sd-c, controls plant height and tiller number. Genetic analysis of an F2 population from a cross between the semi-dwarf mutant and japonica cv. Houshengheng showed that the sd-c locus was flanked by SSR markers RM27877 and RM277 on chromosome 12. Thirty nine InDel markers were developed in the region and the sd-c gene was further mapped to a 1 cM centromeric region between InDel markers C11 and C12. These sequenced markers can be used to distinguish wild type and mutants and thus can be used in marker-assisted selection. The sd-c mutant decreases culm length by about 26% and doubles the tiller number without changing seed weight. Until now only sd-1 has been used in indica rice breeding programs. The sd-c mutant seems to have no undesirable pleiotropic effects and is therefore a potential genetic resource for breeding semi-dwarf indica rice cultivars.
23771580	Identification and functional characterization of silicon transporters in soybean using comparative genomics of major intrinsic proteins in Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Silicon (Si) confers several benefits to many plant species when absorbed as silicic acid through nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs). The NIPs belong to major intrinsic protein (MIP) family, members of which form channels with high selectivity to control transport of water and different solutes. Here, comparative genomic analysis of the MIPs was performed to investigate the presence of Si transporter MIPs in soybean. Thorough analysis of phylogeny, gene organization, transcriptome profiling and protein modeling was performed to characterize MIPs in rice, Arabidopsis and soybean. Based on several attributes, two putative Si transporter genes, GmNIP2-1 and GmNIP2-2, were identified, characterized and cloned from soybean. Expression of both genes was detected in shoot and root tissues, and decreased as Si increased. The protein encoded by GmNIP2-2 showed functionality for Si transport when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, thus confirming the genetic capability of soybean to absorb the element. Comparative analysis of MIPs in plants provides opportunities to decipher gene evolution, functionality and selectivity of nutrient uptake mechanisms. Exploitation of this strategy has helped to uncover unique features of MIPs in soybean. The identification and functional characterization of Si transporters can be exploited to optimize the benefits that plants can derive from Si absorption.
23986916	Proteomic insights into seed germination in response to environmental factors.	2013	Proteomics	Seed germination is a critical process in the life cycle of higher plants. During germination, the imbibed mature seed is highly sensitive to different environmental factors.However, knowledge about the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the environmental effects on germination has been lacking. Recent proteomic work has provided invaluable insight into the molecular processes in germinating seeds of Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max), barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zeamays), tea (Camellia sinensis), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway maple (Acer platanoides) under different treatments including metal ions (e.g. copper and cadmium), drought, low temperature, hormones, and chemicals (gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and α-amanitin), as well as Fusarium graminearum infection. A total of 561 environmental factor-responsive proteins have been identified with various expression patterns in germinating seeds. The data highlight diverse regulatory and metabolic mechanisms upon seed germination, including induction of environmental factor-responsive signaling pathways, seed storage reserve mobilization and utilization, enhancement of DNA repair and modification, regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis, modulation of cell structure, and cell defense. In this review, we summarize the interesting findings and discuss the relevance and significance for our understanding of environmental regulation of seed germination.
23735202	Frequent sensitization to Candida albicans and profilins in adult eosinophilic esophagitis.	2013	Allergy	BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is often associated with atopic airway and skin diseases. More than 80% of EoE patients are sensitized to aero- and/or food allergens. Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated immune responses to microbes have been reported to be deleterious in connection with atopic diseases.

AIM: The aim of this study was to obtain a comprehensive overview about the sensitization spectrum of adult EoE patients.

METHODS: IgE in sera of 35 patients with active EoE were analyzed for reactivity to Candida albicans, as well as to a panel of recombinant and purified natural allergen components, using a microarray.

RESULTS: IgE sensitization to Candida albicans was found in 43% of EoE patients. More than 80% of EoE patients were sensitized to aeroallergens and 22% to food-specific allergen components, whereas 69% of the patients exhibited specific IgE to cross-reactive allergens. Among the latter, profilins were identified as most frequent IgE cross-reactive allergen components. Interestingly, dysphagia, the main symptom of adult EoE patients following rice and/or bread ingestion, was associated with sensitization to cross-reactive allergens such as profilins, pathogenesis-related (PR) 10 and lipid transfer proteins (LTP). Intolerance toward meat rarely correlated with sensitization to animal food allergens.

CONCLUSION: Candida albicans and cross-reactive plant allergen components, in particular profilins, were identified as frequent sensitizers in adult EoE patients. Specific elimination therapies are suggested to reveal their actual roles in the pathogenesis of EoE.
23880034	A rice fungicide blasticidin S efficiently binds Cu(II) ions and prevents DNA from metal-induced damage.	2013	J Inorg Biochem	Blasticidin S is a representative of the aminoacylnucleoside class of antibiotics and it possesses fungicidal properties against the virulent fungus which causes a serious rice blast disease in Asia. It is widely used to control rice blast by foliar application as a crop protection agent. Serious copper contamination is observed in some areas of China. Moreover, some paddy soils present a potential risk of copper accumulation in the human body through the food chain, leading to several disorders. This work presents the results of combined potentiometric and spectroscopic (UV-visible, EPR, CD, NMR) data which lead to the conclusion that the antibiotic is capable of binding copper, and the resulting complexes are likely to form in the soil. The process of complex formation has a potential influence on the population feeding on a rice-based diet. Moreover, the results of electrophoretic experiments revealed that complexes do not cleave DNA. On the contrary, the presence of blasticidin S may prevent DNA from a Cu(II)-induced damage.
23765738	Research on the changes in wettability of rice (Oryza sativa.) leaf surfaces at different development stages using the OWRK method.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: A good knowledge in wetting behavior of pesticide spray liquid on plant surface is crucial to spray applications. Difference in leaf surface wettability would result in obvious changes in spray wetting behavior. The aim of this paper is to obtain the changes of wettability during different growth periods.

RESULTS: The contact angle (CA) of rice leaf for each liquid increased with rice growth. No significant difference was found between cultivars. The CA was found to be correlated with the polar component of liquid surface tension. The square of the polar component was also found to be highly significant indicating that the relationship between these two properties was not a simple linear one. The surface energy of each plant surface decreased as the plants aged. This was also true of each part of the surface energy. However, no obvious difference on the proportion of the components was found among different cultivars and stages.

CONCLUSIONS: The changes in value of CA and surface free energy (SFE) both reflect the changes of the leaf surface wettability, while the SFE value shows better in wettability characterizing. Obvious rice leaf wettability changes were found on different development stages, which may be beneficial for researches in agrochemical sprays wetting and spreading behavior. Factors influencing these alterations were discussed.
23750250	Emissions of CH4 and N2O under different tillage systems from double-cropped paddy fields in Southern China.	2013	PLoS One	Understanding greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is becoming increasingly important with the climate change. Most previous studies have focused on the assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential and GHG emissions from agriculture. However, specific experiments assessing tillage impacts on GHG emission from double-cropped paddy fields in Southern China are relatively scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of tillage systems on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in a double rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping system. The experiment was established in 2005 in Hunan Province, China. Three tillage treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design: conventional tillage (CT), rotary tillage (RT) and no-till (NT). Fluxes of CH4 from different tillage treatments followed a similar trend during the two years, with a single peak emission for the early rice season and a double peak emission for the late rice season. Compared with other treatments, NT significantly reduced CH4 emission among the rice growing seasons (P<0.05). However, much higher variations in N2O emission were observed across the rice growing seasons due to the vulnerability of N2O to external influences. The amount of CH4 emission in paddy fields was much higher relative to N2O emission. Conversion of CT to NT significantly reduced the cumulative CH4 emission for both rice seasons compared with other treatments (P<0.05). The mean value of global warming potentials (GWPs) of CH4 and N2O emissions over 100 years was in the order of NT<RT<CT, which indicated NT was significantly lower than both CT and RT (P<0.05). This suggests that adoption of NT would be beneficial for GHG mitigation and could be a good option for carbon-smart agriculture in double rice cropped regions.
23755304	Modified whole effluent toxicity test to assess and decouple wastewater effects from environmental gradients.	2013	PLoS One	Environmental gradients and wastewater discharges produce aggregated effects on marine populations, obscuring the detection of human impact. Classical assessment methods do not include environmental effects in toxicity tests designs, which could lead to incorrect conclusions. We proposed a modified Whole Effluent Toxicity test (mWET) that includes environmental gradients in addition to effluent dilutions, together with the application of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to assess and decouple those effects. We tested this approach, analyzing the lethal effects of wastewater on a marine sandy beach bivalve affected by an artificial canal freshwater discharge used for rice crops irrigation. To this end, we compared bivalve mortality between canal water dilutions (CWd) and salinity controls (SC: without canal water). CWd were prepared by diluting the water effluent (sampled during the pesticide application period) with artificial marine water. The salinity gradient was included in the design by achieving the same final salinities in both CWd and SC, allowing us to account for the effects of salinity by including this variable as a random factor in the GLMM. Our approach detected significantly higher mortalities in CWd, indicating potential toxic effects of the effluent discharge. mWET represents an improvement over the internationally standardized WET tests, since it considers environmental variability and uses appropriate statistical analyses.
23898996	Evaluation of Streptomyces spp. for their plant-growth-promotion traits in rice.	2013	Can J Microbiol	Five strains of Streptomyces (CAI-17, CAI-68, CAI-78, KAI-26, and KAI-27) were previously reported to have potential for charcoal rot control and plant growth promotion (PGP) in sorghum. In this study, those 5 Streptomyces strains were characterized for their enzymatic activities and evaluated for their PGP capabilities on rice. All the Streptomyces strains were able to produce lipase and β-1,3-glucanase; grew in NaCl (up to 8%), at pH 5-13, and at temperatures 20-40 °C; and were resistant to ampicillin, sensitive to nalidixic acid, and highly sensitive to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. They were highly tolerant to the fungicide bavistin but were highly sensitive to benlate, benomyl, and radonil. When evaluated on rice in the field, Streptomyces significantly enhanced tiller and panicle numbers, stover and grain yields, dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight, compared with the control. In the rhizosphere at harvest, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and % organic carbon were also found significantly higher in Streptomyces-treated plots than in the control plots. This study further confirms that the selected Streptomyces have PGP activities.
23753178	Elucidating rice cell metabolism under flooding and drought stresses using flux-based modeling and analysis.	2013	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the major food crops in world agriculture, especially in Asia. However, the possibility of subsequent occurrence of flood and drought is a major constraint to its production. Thus, the unique behavior of rice toward flooding and drought stresses has required special attention to understand its metabolic adaptations. However, despite several decades of research investigations, the cellular metabolism of rice remains largely unclear. In this study, in order to elucidate the physiological characteristics in response to such abiotic stresses, we reconstructed what is to our knowledge the first metabolic/regulatory network model of rice, representing two tissue types: germinating seeds and photorespiring leaves. The phenotypic behavior and metabolic states simulated by the model are highly consistent with our suspension culture experiments as well as previous reports. The in silico simulation results of seed-derived rice cells indicated (1) the characteristic metabolic utilization of glycolysis and ethanolic fermentation based on oxygen availability and (2) the efficient sucrose breakdown through sucrose synthase instead of invertase. Similarly, flux analysis on photorespiring leaf cells elucidated the crucial role of plastid-cytosol and mitochondrion-cytosol malate transporters in recycling the ammonia liberated during photorespiration and in exporting the excess redox cofactors, respectively. The model simulations also unraveled the essential role of mitochondrial respiration during drought stress. In the future, the combination of experimental and in silico analyses can serve as a promising approach to understand the complex metabolism of rice and potentially help in identifying engineering targets for improving its productivity as well as enabling stress tolerance.
23790232	Lipid biomarkers in ooids from different locations and ages: evidence for a common bacterial flora.	2013	Geobiology	Ooids are one of the common constituents of ancient carbonate rocks, yet the role that microbial communities may or may not play in their formation remains unresolved. To search for evidence of microbial activity in modern and Holocene ooids, samples collected from intertidal waters, beaches and outcrops in the Bahamas and in Shark Bay in Western Australia were examined for their contents of lipid biomarkers. Modern samples from Cat and Andros islands in the Bahamas and from Carbla Beach in Hamelin Pool, Western Australia, showed abundant and notably similar distributions of hydrocarbons, fatty acids (FAs) and alcohols. A large fraction of these lipids were bound into the carbonate matrix and only released on acid dissolution, which suggests that these lipids were being incorporated continuously during ooid growth. The distributions of hydrocarbons, and their disparate carbon isotopic signatures, were consistent with mixed input from cyanobacteria together with small and variable amounts of vascular plant leaf wax [C27 -C35 ; δ(13) C -25 to -32‰Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)]. The FAs comprised a complex mixture of C12 -C18 normal and branched short-chain compounds with the predominant straight-chain components attributable to bacteria and/or cyanobacteria. Branched FA, especially 10-MeC16 and 10-MeC17 , together with the prevalence of elemental sulfur in the extracts, indicate an origin from sulfate-reducing bacteria. The iso- and anteiso-FA were quite variable in their (13) C contents suggesting that they come from organisms with diverse physiologies. Hydrogen isotopic compositions provide further insight into this issue. FAs in each sample show disparate δD values consistent with inputs from autotrophs and heterotrophs. The most enigmatic lipid assemblage is an homologous series of long-chain (C24 -C32 ) FA with pronounced even carbon number preference. Typically, such long-chain FA are thought to come from land plant leaf wax, but in this case, their (13) C-enriched isotopic signatures compared to co-occurring n-alkanes (e.g., Hamelin Pool TLE FA C24 -C32 ; δ(13) C -20 to -24.2‰ VPDB; TLE n-alkanes δ(13) C -24.1 to -26.2 -‰VPDB) indicate a microbial origin, possibly sulfate-reducing bacteria. Lastly, we identified homohopanoic acid and bishomohopanol as the primary degradation products of bacterial hopanoids. The distributions of lipids isolated from Holocene oolites from the Rice Bay Formation of Cat Island, Bahamas were very similar to the beach ooids described above and, in total, these modern and fossil biomarker data lead us to hypothesize that ooids are colonized by a defined microbial community and that these microbes possibly mediate calcification.
23797042	Progress towards the 'Golden Age' of biotechnology.	2013	Curr Opin Biotechnol	Biotechnology uses substances, materials or extracts derived from living cells, employing 22 million Europeans in a € 1.5 Tn endeavour, being the premier global economic growth opportunity this century. Significant advances have been made in red biotechnology using pharmaceutically and medically relevant applications, green biotechnology developing agricultural and environmental tools and white biotechnology serving industrial scale uses, frequently as process feedstocks. Red biotechnology has delivered dramatic improvements in controlling human disease, from antibiotics to overcome bacterial infections to anti-HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals such as azidothymidine (AZT), anti-malarial compounds and novel vaccines saving millions of lives. Green biotechnology has dramatically increased food production through Agrobacterium and biolistic genetic modifications for the development of 'Golden Rice', pathogen resistant crops expressing crystal toxin genes, drought resistance and cold tolerance to extend growth range. The burgeoning area of white biotechnology has delivered bio-plastics, low temperature enzyme detergents and a host of feedstock materials for industrial processes such as modified starches, without which our everyday lives would be much more complex. Biotechnological applications can bridge these categories, by modifying energy crops properties, or analysing circulating nucleic acid elements, bringing benefits for all, through increased food production, supporting climate change adaptation and the low carbon economy, or novel diagnostics impacting on personalized medicine and genetic disease. Cross-cutting technologies such as PCR, novel sequencing tools, bioinformatics, transcriptomics and epigenetics are in the vanguard of biotechnological progress leading to an ever-increasing breadth of applications. Biotechnology will deliver solutions to unimagined problems, providing food security, health and well-being to mankind for centuries to come.
23770899	Dry/Wet cycles change the activity and population dynamics of methanotrophs in rice field soil.	2013	Appl Environ Microbiol	The methanotrophs in rice field soil are crucial in regulating the emission of methane. Drainage substantially reduces methane emission from rice fields. However, it is poorly understood how drainage affects microbial methane oxidation. Therefore, we analyzed the dynamics of methane oxidation rates, composition (using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [T-RFLP]), and abundance (using quantitative PCR [qPCR]) of methanotroph pmoA genes (encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase) and their transcripts over the season and in response to alternate dry/wet cycles in planted paddy field microcosms. In situ methane oxidation accounted for less than 15% of total methane production but was enhanced by intermittent drainage. The dry/wet alternations resulted in distinct effects on the methanotrophic communities in different soil compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, surface soil). The methanotrophic communities of the different soil compartments also showed distinct seasonal dynamics. In bulk soil, potential methanotrophic activity and transcription of pmoA were relatively low but were significantly stimulated by drainage. In contrast, however, in the rhizosphere and surface soils, potential methanotrophic activity and pmoA transcription were relatively high but decreased after drainage events and resumed after reflooding. While type II methanotrophs dominated the communities in the bulk soil and rhizosphere soil compartments (and to a lesser extent also in the surface soil), it was the pmoA of type I methanotrophs that was mainly transcribed under flooded conditions. Drainage affected the composition of the methanotrophic community only minimally but strongly affected metabolically active methanotrophs. Our study revealed dramatic dynamics in the abundance, composition, and activity of the various type I and type II methanotrophs on both a seasonal and a spatial scale and showed strong effects of dry/wet alternation cycles, which enhanced the attenuation of methane flux into the atmosphere.
23776591	Characterization of rice black-streaked dwarf virus- and rice stripe virus-derived siRNAs in singly and doubly infected insect vector Laodelphax striatellus.	2013	PLoS One	Replication of RNA viruses in insect cells triggers an antiviral defense that is mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) which generates viral-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, it is not known whether an antiviral RNAi response is also induced in insects by reoviruses, whose double-stranded RNA genome replication is thought to occur within core particles. Deep sequencing of small RNAs showed that when the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) was infected by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) (Reoviridae; Fijivirus), more viral-derived siRNAs accumulated than when the vector insect was infected by Rice stripe virus (RSV), a negative single-stranded RNA virus. RBSDV siRNAs were predominantly 21 and 22 nucleotides long and there were almost equal numbers of positive and negative sense. RBSDV siRNAs were frequently generated from hotspots in the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of viral genome segments but these hotspots were not associated with any predicted RNA secondary structures. Under laboratory condition, L. striatellus can be infected simultaneously with RBSDV and RSV. Double infection enhanced the accumulation of particular genome segments but not viral coat protein of RBSDV and correlated with an increase in the abundance of siRNAs derived from RBSDV. The results of this study suggest that reovirus replication in its insect vector potentially induces an RNAi-mediated antiviral response.
23860021	Relationship between adiponectin and leptin, and blood lipids in hyperlipidemia patients treated with red yeast rice.	2013	Forsch Komplementmed	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the possible relationships between adiponectin and leptin, blood lipids such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) as well as other clinical biomarkers in hyperlipidemia patients treated with red yeast rice.

METHODS: 30 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were recruited, treated with red rice yeast capsules 600 mg twice a day for 8 weeks, and followed up for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the mean difference in LDL-C from baseline to week 8, while the secondary endpoints were the mean percentage changes from baseline of total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, adiponectin, and leptin.

RESULTS: At week 8, the decrease in LDL-C and total cholesterol was -38.11 ± 30.90 mg/dl (p < 0.0001) and -44.54 ± 27.46 mg/dl (p < 0.0001), respectively, and the increase in adiponectin was 35.83 ± 67.85 μg/ml (p = 0.017) as compared to baseline. Adiponectin also correlated positively with HDL-C (r2 = 0.39; p = 0.001). Serum leptin correlated negatively with TG (r2 = 0.19; p = 0.035), and there was a trend of correlation between leptin and HDL-C, but this was not statistically significant (r2 = 0.16; p = 0.052).

CONCLUSION: Red yeast rice can significantly increase adiponectin and can significantly lower LDL-C and total cholesterol levels. Adiponectin correlates positively with HDL-C while serum leptin correlates negatively with TG. Red yeast rice has a potentially protective effect in obesity-related and cardiovascular diseases.
23846143	Formulation and in vitro evaluation of metformin hydrochloride loaded microspheres prepared with polysaccharide extracted from natural sources.	2013	Acta Pharm	The present work envisages utilisation of biodegradable and biocompatible material from natural sources for the development of controlled release microspheres of metformin hydrochloride (MetH). Natural polysaccharides extracted from Dillenia indica L. (DI), Abelmoschus esculentus L. (AE) and Bora rice flour were used in fabricating controlled release microspheres. The microspheres were prepared by the emulsion solvent diffusion technique with different proportions of natural materials and were studied for entrapment efficiency, particle size, particle shape, surface morphology, drug excipient compatibility, mucoadhesivity and in vitro release properties. The prepared microspheres showed mucoadhesive properties and controlled release of metformin hydrochloride. The study has revealed that natural materials can be used for formulation of controlled release microspheres and will provide ample opportunities for further study.
23853508	The transformation of the photo-thermo sensitive genic male-sterile line 261S of rice via an expression vector containing the anti-Waxy gene.	2013	Breed Sci	Transgenic photo-thermo sensitive genic male sterility Oryza sativa L. cv. "261S" plants with the anti-Waxy gene were successfully obtained using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated co-transformation method. Marker-free homozygous transgenic lines with the anti-Waxy gene were obtained. The setting seed rates of the transgenic plants via self-pollination or via crossing with the restorer line WX99075 rice and the 1000-grain weight of the transgenic plants and the F2 hybrid seeds obtained by crossing the transgenic or non-transgenic plants with the restorer line WX99075 rice, and the number of panicles of the transgenic plants and yields of the F2 hybrid rice, were analysed. Quality indexes of the transgenic plants and of the F2 hybrid seeds were analysed. Our researches results indicate that hybrid female and hybrid descendant edibility could be improved via the introduction of the anti-Waxy gene, but the grain yields of the reserve seeds via self-pollination of the transgenic photo-thermo sensitive genic sterile lines and of the hybrid rice were not affected.
23748134	Proteome analysis of the plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2013	Biochim Biophys Acta	The plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the causal agent of bacterial blight, which is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Xoo has been studied for over one century, and much has been learned about it, but proteomic investigation has been neglected. In this study, proteome reference maps of Xoo were constructed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and 628 spots in the gels representing 469 different protein species were identified with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The identified spots were assigned to 15 functional categories according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and the annotations from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The data set has been deposited in the World-2DPAGE database (Database ID: 0044). In addition, comparative proteomic analysis revealed that proteins related to the TonB-dependent transportation system and energy metabolism are involved in the phenazine-1-carboxylic acid resistance in Xoo. In conclusion, we have established a proteome database for Xoo and have used this database in a comparative proteomic analysis that identified proteins potentially contributing to phenazine-1-carboxylic acid resistance in Xoo.
23835359	A critical comparison of two high-throughput ascorbate analyses methods for plant samples.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Ascorbate (AsA) is an important metabolite involved in stress response and development of plants. Therefore it is necessary to quantify the AsA content in many fields of plant science, including high throughput and critical applications. In this study we compared two different microplate-based AsA assays, which are suitable for high throughput applications: an ascorbate oxidase (AO)-based assay and a dipyridyl (DPD)-based assay. These methods were compared in critical applications, i.e. (i) when AsA concentrations were very low such as in apoplastic extracts, (ii) when plants contained pigments interfering with the spectrometric measurements, and (iii) when plants contained high iron concentration interfering with the color reactions. The precision of measurements was higher with the DPD method, as illustrated by higher recovery rates of internal AsA standards. On the other hand, the AO method was more sensitive to low levels of AsA. This was an advantage in determining apoplastic AsA concentration in rice, which was substantially lower than that of whole tissues. The AO method also had the advantage that plant pigments and high iron concentrations in plants tissues did not interfere with the analysis, as opposed to the DPD assay. In conclusion, both assays had advantages and the choice of a suitable method depends on the specific application.
23777608	Nuclear proteome response to cell wall removal in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Proteome Sci	Plant cells are routinely exposed to various pathogens and environmental stresses that cause cell wall perturbations. Little is known of the mechanisms that plant cells use to sense these disturbances and transduce corresponding signals to regulate cellular responses to maintain cell wall integrity. Previous studies in rice have shown that removal of the cell wall leads to substantial chromatin reorganization and histone modification changes concomitant with cell wall re-synthesis. But the genes and proteins that regulate these cellular responses are still largely unknown. Here we present an examination of the nuclear proteome differential expression in response to removal of the cell wall in rice suspension cells using multiple nuclear proteome extraction methods. A total of 382 nuclear proteins were identified with two or more peptides, including 26 transcription factors. Upon removal of the cell wall, 142 nuclear proteins were up regulated and 112 were down regulated. The differentially expressed proteins included transcription factors, histones, histone domain containing proteins, and histone modification enzymes. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed proteins indicates that chromatin & nucleosome assembly, protein-DNA complex assembly, and DNA packaging are tightly associated with cell wall removal. Our results indicate that removal of the cell wall imposes a tremendous challenge to the cells. Consequently, plant cells respond to the removal of the cell wall in the nucleus at every level of the regulatory hierarchy.
23810898	Xlr1 is involved in the transcriptional control of the pentose catabolic pathway, but not hemi-cellulolytic enzymes in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Fungal Genet Biol	Magnaporthe oryzae is a fungal plant pathogen of many grasses including rice. Since arabinoxylan is one of the major components of the plant cell wall of grasses, M. oryzae is likely to degrade this polysaccharide for supporting its growth in infected leaves. D-Xylose is released from arabinoxylan by fungal depolymerising enzymes and catabolized through the pentose pathway. The expression of genes involved in these pathways is under control of the transcriptional activator XlnR/Xlr1, conserved among filamentous ascomycetes. In this study, we identified M. oryzae genes involved in the pentose catabolic pathway (PCP) and their function during infection, including the XlnR homolog, XLR1, through the phenotypic analysis of targeted null mutants. Growth of the Δxlr1 strain was reduced on D-xylose and xylan, but unaffected on L-arabinose and arabinan. A strong reduction of PCP gene expression was observed in the Δxlr1 strain on D-xylose and L-arabinose. However, there was no significant difference in xylanolytic and cellulolytic enzyme activities between the Δxlr1 mutant and the reference strain. These data demonstrate that XLR1 encodes the transcriptional activator of the PCP in M. oryzae, but does not appear to play a role in the regulation of the (hemi-) cellulolytic system in this fungus. This indicates only partial similarity in function between Xlr1 and A. niger XlnR. The deletion mutant of D-xylulose kinase encoding gene (XKI1) is clearly unable to grow on either D-xylose or L-arabinose and showed reduced growth on xylitol, L-arabitol and xylan. Δxki1 displayed an interesting molecular phenotype as it over-expressed other PCP genes as well as genes encoding (hemi-) cellulolytic enzymes. However, neither Δxlr1 nor Δxki1 showed significant differences in their pathogeny on rice and barley compared to the wild type, suggesting that D-xylose catabolism is not required for fungal growth in infected leaves.
23749877	Detection of previously unknown fumonisin P analogue mycotoxins in a Fusarium verticillioides culture by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization time-of-flight and ion trap mass spectrometry.	2014	J Chromatogr Sci	Five previously unknown fumonisin mycotoxins (iso-FP1, iso-FP(2,3a), iso-FP(2,3b), FP4 and iso-FP4) and three previously described FP analogues (FP(1-3)) were detected in a solid rice culture inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides. The fumonisins were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOFMS) and ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS). The FP isomers were separated by using a flat gradient on a special, high-coverage C18, narrow-bore HPLC column (YMC-Pack J'sphere ODS H80), which was suggested for the separation of structural isomers. The verified structures of the FP(1-3) mycotoxins, the relative retention times (by HPLC-ESI-TOFMS and ITMS), the exact masses of the molecular ions (by TOFMS) and the masses of the product ions, including the hydrocarbon backbones (by ITMS) of the new compounds, strongly suggested their structures.
23731867	Cadmium-tolerant bacteria reduce the uptake of cadmium in rice: potential for microbial bioremediation.	2013	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	We selected 24 bacterial isolates that could tolerate up to 2500 µM CdCl2 from the soil of rice fields downstream from a zinc-mineralized area contaminated with a high level of cadmium (Cd). In the presence of 500 µM CdCl2, all isolates grew slower and with a prolonged lag-phase compared to in the absence of Cd. Cd-binding capacity was high and ranged from 6.38 to 9.38 log[Cd(atom)]/cell. The stability of Cd complexes in bacteria was affected by 1mM EDTA. In 500 µM CdCl2, all isolates produced 0.7 to 4.8-fold more inorganic sulfide and 0.6 to 2.2-fold more thio-rich compounds containing SH groups. Out of 24 Cd-tolerant bacterial isolates, KKU2500-3, -8, -9 and -20 were able to promote the growth of Thai jasmine rice (Kao Hom Mali 105) seedlings in the presence of 200 µM CdCl2, and KKU2500-3 produced the highest numbers of fibrous root. Interestingly, these 4 isolates increased Cd tolerance and decreased the accumulation of Cd in rice by 61, 9, 6, and 17% when grown in the presence of 200 µM CdCl2. Of the 4 isolates, KKU2500-3 produced more inorganic sulfide when grown in CdCl2 at 500-2000 µM. XANES analyses indicated that this isolate precipitated a detectable amount of cadmium sulfide (CdS) when grown in 500 µM CdCl2. Thus, the isolate KKU2500-3 could possibly transform toxic, soluble CdCl2 into non-toxic, insoluble CdS. These 4Cd-tolerant bacterial isolates were identified via 16S rDNA sequencing and classified as Cupriavidus taiwanensis KKU2500-3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa KKU2500-8, -9, and -20.
23813016	A suite of new genes defining salinity stress tolerance in seedlings of contrasting rice genotypes.	2013	Funct Integr Genomics	Salinity is one of the major constraints adversely influencing crop productivity. Saltol QTL is a major QTL associated with Na⁺-K⁺ ratio and seedling stage salinity tolerance in rice. With an aim to understand the contribution of individual genes localized within saltol towards salinity tolerance, we analysed the transcript abundance of a set of these genes in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice. We hypothesize that this approach may be helpful in identifying new 'candidate genes' for improving salinity tolerance in crops. For this purpose, seedlings of Oryza sativa cv. IR64 (sensitive) and the landrace Pokkali (tolerant) were subjected to short/long durations of salinity. qRT-PCR analysis clearly exhibited differential regulation of genes encoding signaling related protein (SRPs), where higher transcript abundance for most of them was observed in Pokkali than IR64 under non-stress conditions, thereby indicating towards well preparedness of the former to handle stress, in anticipation. Genes encoding proteins of unknown function (PUFs), though, constitute a considerable portion of plant genome, have so far been neglected in most studies. Time course analysis of these genes showed a continuous increase in their abundance in Pokkali, while in IR64, their abundance increased till 24 h followed by a clear decrease, thereby justifying their nomenclature as 'salinity induced factors' (SIFs). This is the first report showing possible involvement of SIFs localized within salinity related QTL towards salinity stress response. Based on the phenotypes of insertional mutants, it is proposed that these SIFs may have a putative function in vegetative growth (SIFVG), fertility (SIFF), viability (SIFV) or early flowering (SIFEF).
23799885	Genetic variation in four maturity genes affects photoperiod insensitivity and PHYA-regulated post-flowering responses of soybean.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Absence of or low sensitivity to photoperiod is necessary for short-day crops, such as rice and soybean, to adapt to high latitudes. Photoperiod insensitivity in soybeans is controlled by two genetic systems and involves three important maturity genes: E1, a repressor for two soybean orthologs of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (GmFT2a and GmFT5a), and E3 and E4, which are phytochrome A genes. To elucidate the diverse mechanisms underlying photoperiod insensitivity in soybean, we assessed the genotypes of four maturity genes (E1 through E4) in early-flowering photoperiod-insensitive cultivars and their association with post-flowering responses.

RESULTS: We found two novel dysfunctional alleles in accessions originally considered to have a dominant E3 allele according to known DNA markers. The E3 locus, together with E1 and E4, contained multiple dysfunctional alleles. We identified 15 multi-locus genotypes, which we subdivided into 6 genotypic groups by classifying their alleles by function. Of these, the e1-as/e3/E4 genotypic group required an additional novel gene (different from E1, E3, and E4) to condition photoperiod insensitivity. Despite their common pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity, accessions with different multi-locus genotypes responded differently to the post-flowering photoperiod. Cultivars carrying E3 or E4 were sensitive to photoperiod for post-flowering characteristics, such as reproductive period and stem growth after flowering. The phytochrome A-regulated expression of the determinate growth habit gene Dt1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER1, was involved in the persistence of the vegetative activity at the stem apical meristem of flower-induced plants under long-day conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: Diverse genetic mechanisms underlie photoperiod insensitivity in soybean. At least three multi-locus genotypes consisting of various allelic combinations at E1, E3, and E4 conferred pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity to soybean cultivars but led to different responses to photoperiod during post-flowering vegetative and reproductive development. The phyA genes E3 and E4 are major controllers underlying not only pre-flowering but also post-flowering photoperiod responses. The current findings improve our understanding of genetic diversity in pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity and mechanisms of post-flowering photoperiod responses in soybean.
23810152	Early regular egg exposure in infants with eczema: A randomized controlled trial.	2013	J Allergy Clin Immunol	BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that early regular ingestion of allergenic foods might reduce the risk of food allergy.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether early regular oral egg exposure will reduce subsequent IgE-mediated egg allergy in infants with moderate-to-severe eczema.

METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial infants were allocated to 1 teaspoon of pasteurized raw whole egg powder (n = 49) or rice powder (n = 37) daily from 4 to 8 months of age. Cooked egg was introduced to both groups after an observed feed at 8 months. The primary outcome was IgE-mediated egg allergy at 12 months, as defined based on the results of an observed pasteurized raw egg challenge and skin prick tests.

RESULTS: A high proportion (31% [15/49]) of infants randomized to receive egg had an allergic reaction to the egg powder and did not continue powder ingestion. At 4 months of age, before any known egg ingestion, 36% (24/67) of infants already had egg-specific IgE levels of greater than 0.35 kilounits of antibody (kUA)/L. At 12 months, a lower (but not significant) proportion of infants in the egg group (33%) were given a diagnosis of IgE-mediated egg allergy compared with the control group (51%; relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38-1.11; P = .11). Egg-specific IgG4 levels were significantly (P < .001) greater in the egg group at both 8 and 12 months.

CONCLUSION: Induction of immune tolerance pathways and reduction in egg allergy incidence can be achieved by early regular oral egg exposure in infants with eczema. Caution needs to be taken when these high-risk infants are first exposed to egg because many have sensitization already by 4 months of age.
23782532	Acetolactate synthases MoIlv2 and MoIlv6 are required for infection-related morphogenesis in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Mol Plant Pathol	Amino acids are important components in the metabolism of a variety of pathogens, plants and animals. Acetolactate synthase (ALS) catalyses the first common step in leucine, isoleucine and valine biosynthesis, and is the target of several classes of inhibitors. Here, MoIlv2, an orthologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALS catalytic subunit Ilv2, and MoIlv6, an orthologue of the S. cerevisiae ALS regulatory subunit Ilv6, were identified. To characterize MoILV2 and MoILV6 functions, we generated the deletion mutants ΔMoilv2 and ΔMoilv6. Phenotypic analysis showed that both mutants were auxotrophic for leucine, isoleucine and valine, and were defective in conidial morphogenesis, appressorial penetration and pathogenicity. Further studies suggested that MoIlv2 and MoIlv6 play a critical role in maintaining the balance of intracellular amino acid levels. MoIlv2 and MoIlv6 are both localized to the mitochondria and the signal peptide of MoIlv6 is critical for its localization. In summary, our evidence indicates that MoIlv2 plays a crucial role in isoleucine and valine biosynthesis, whereas MoIlv6 contributes to isoleucine and leucine biosynthesis; both genes are required for fungal pathogenicity. This study indicates the potential of targeting branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis for anti-rice blast management.
23803749	Presence of LYM2 dependent but CERK1 independent disease resistance in Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Plants have the ability to detect invading fungi through the perception of chitin fragments released from the fungal cell walls. Plant chitin receptor consists of two types of plasma membrane proteins, CEBiP and CERK1. However, the contribution of these proteins to chitin signaling is different between Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, it seems CERK1 receptor kinase is enough for both ligand perception and signaling, whereas both CEBiP and OsCERK1 are required for chitin signaling in rice. Here we report that Arabidopsis CEBiP homolog, LYM2, is not involved in chitin signaling but contributes to resistance against a fungal pathogen, Alternaria brassicicola, indicating the presence of a novel disease resistance mechanism in Arabidopsis.
23773148	Adaptation to acidic soil is achieved by increased numbers of cis-acting elements regulating ALMT1 expression in Holcus lanatus.	2013	Plant J	Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), which belongs to the Poaceae family and is a close relative of the agronomic crop oat (Avena sativa), is a widely adaptable grass species that is able to grow on highly acidic soils with high levels of Al, but the mechanism underlying the high Al tolerance is unknown. Here, we characterized two accessions of H. lanatus collected from an acid plot (soil pH 3.6, HL-A) and a neutral plot (pH 7.1, HL-N) in terms of Al tolerance, organic acid anion secretion and related gene expression. In response to Al (pH 4.5), the HL-A roots secreted approximately twice as much malate as the HL-N roots, but there was no difference in citrate secretion. Cloning of the gene HlALMT1 responsible for malate secretion showed that the encoded amino acid sequence did not differ between two accessions, but the expression level in the outer cell layers of the HL-A roots was twice as high as in the HL-N roots. This difference was not due to the genomic copy number, but was due to the number of cis-acting elements for an Al-responsive transcription factor (HlART1) in the promoter region of HlALMT1, as demonstrated by both a yeast one-hybrid assay and a transient assay in tobacco protoplasts. Furthermore, introduction of HlALMT1 driven by the HL-A promoter into rice resulted in significantly more Al-induced malate secretion than introduction of HlALMT1 driven by the HL-N promoter. These findings indicate that the adaptation of H. lanatus to acidic soils may be achieved by increasing number of cis-acting elements for ART1 in the promoter region of the HlALMT1 gene, enhancing the expression of HlALMT1 and the secretion of malate.
23847440	Loop nucleotide polymorphism in a putative miRNA precursor associated with seed length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Int J Biol Sci	The terminal loop region of primary miRNA transcripts is an important determinant controlling miRNA function in human, animals and plants. However, the effects of polymorphisms in loop region of miRNA precusors on phenotypic variation have not been reported, especially on agronomic traits in rice. From rice japonica variety Koshihikari and indica Guichao2, we isolated a precursor of putative miRNA osa-MIR2923a. We detected a GG/AA polymorphism in the loop structure from japonica and indica rice varieties, which was corresponding to japonica/indica rice differentiation. By using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, we measured the polymorphisms in a RIL (recombinant inbred lines) population derived from japonica variety Koshihikari and indica Guichao2. We found that the GG/AA polymorphism in the osa-MIR2923a loop was correlated to grain length and length-width ratio. We further found the significant association between seed length and GG/AA polymorphism in a population consisting of 72 rice landraces. Three targets were predicted, whose expressions showed significant differences between the two varieties. Our results suggested that the putative miRNA precursor and the three target genes could play functional roles for indica/japonica seed differentiation.
23791937	Enzyme dimension of the ribosomal protein S4 across plant and animal kingdoms.	2013	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: The protein S4 of the smaller ribosomal subunit is centrally important for its anchorage role in ribosome assembly and rRNA binding. Eubacterial S4 also facilitates synthesis of rRNA, and restrains translation of ribosomal proteins of the same polycistronic mRNA. Eukaryotic S4 has no homolog in eubacterial kingdom, nor are such extraribosomal functions of S4 known in plants and animals even as genetic evidence suggests that deficiency of S4X isoform in 46,XX human females may produce Turner syndrome (45,XO).

METHODS: Recombinant human S4X and rice S4 were used to determine their enzymatic action in the cleavage of synthetic peptide substrates and natural proteins. We also studied autoproteolysis of the recombinant S4 proteins, and examined the growth and proliferation of S4-transfected human embryonic kidney cells.

RESULTS: Extraribosomal enzyme nature of eukaryotic S4 is described. Both human S4X and rice S4 are cysteine proteases capable of hydrolyzing a wide spectrum of peptides and natural proteins of diverse origin. Whereas rice S4 also cleaves the -XXXD↓- consensus sequence assumed to be specific for caspase-9 and granzyme B, human S4 does not. Curiously, both human and rice S4 show multiple-site autoproteolysis leading to self-annihilation. Overexpression of human S4 blocks the growth and proliferation of transfected embryonic kidney cells, presumably due to the extraribosomal enzyme trait reported.

CONCLUSIONS: The S4 proteins of humans and rice, prototypes of eukaryota, are non-specific cysteine proteases in the extraribosomal milieu.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The enzyme nature of S4 is relevant toward understanding not only the origin of ribosomal proteins, but also processes in cell biology and diseases.
23759057	Mutation by DNA shuffling of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Malus domestica for improved glyphosate resistance.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	A new 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene from Malus domestica (MdEPSPS) was cloned and characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends to identify an EPSPS gene appropriate for the development of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant plants. However, wild-type MdEPSPS is not suitable for the development of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant plants because of its poor glyphosate resistance. Thus, we performed DNA shuffling on MdEPSPS, and one highly glyphosate-resistant mutant with mutations in eight amino acids (N63D, N86S, T101A, A187T, D230G, H317R, Y399R and C413A.) was identified after five rounds of DNA shuffling and screening. Among the eight amino acid substitutions on this mutant, only two residue changes (T101A and A187T) were identified by site-directed mutagenesis as essential and additive in altering glyphosate resistance, which was further confirmed by kinetic analyses. The single-site A187T mutation has also never been previously reported as an important residue for glyphosate resistance. Furthermore, transgenic rice was used to confirm the potential of MdEPSPS mutant in developing glyphosate-resistant crops.
23812819	Quantification of rice sheath blight progression caused by Rhizoctonia solani.	2013	J Microbiol	Rhizoctonia solani has a wide host range, including almost all cultivated crops and its subgroup anastomosis group (AG)-1 IA causes sheath blight in rice. An accurate measurement of pathogen's biomass is a convincing tool for enumeration of this disease. Mycological characteristics and molecular diagnosis simultaneously supported that all six strains in this study were R. solani AG-1 IA. Heterokaryons between strains Rs40104, Rs40105, and Rs45811 were stable and viable, whereas Rs40103 and Rs40106 did not form viable fused cells, except for the combination of Rs40106 and Rs40104. A primer pair was highly specific to RsAROM gene of R. solani strains and the amplified fragment exists as double copies within fungal genome. The relationship between crossing point (CP) values and the amount of fungal DNA was reliable (R (2) >0.99). Based on these results, we determined R. solani's proliferation within infected stems through real time PCR using a primer pair and a Taqman probe specific to the RsAROM gene. The amount of fungal DNA within the 250 ng of tissue DNA from rice cv. Dongjin infected with Rs40104, Rs40105, and Rs45811 were 7.436, 5.830, and 5.085 ng, respectively. In contrast, the fungal DNAs within the stems inoculated with Rs40103 and Rs40106 were 0.091 and 0.842 ng. The sheath blight symptom progression approximately coincided with the amount of fungal DNA within the symptoms. In summary, our quantitative evaluation method provided reliable and objective results reflecting the amount of fungal biomass within the infected tissues and would be useful for evaluation of resistance germplasm or fungicides and estimation of inoculum potential.
23860229	Analysis of transcript and metabolite levels in Italian rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars subjected to osmotic stress or benzothiadiazole treatment.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	One of the major objectives of rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs is the development of new varieties with higher tolerance/resistance to both abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, Italian rice cultivars were subjected to osmotic stress or benzothiadiazole (BTH) treatments. An analysis of the expression of selected genes known to be involved in the stress response and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) metabolic profiling were combined with multivariate statistical analyses to elucidate potential correlations between gene expression or metabolite content and observed tolerant/resistant phenotypes. We observed that the expression of three chosen genes (two WRKY genes and one peroxidase encoding gene) differed between susceptible and resistant cultivars in response to BTH treatments. Moreover, the analysis of metabolite content, in particular in the osmotic stress experiment, enabled discrimination between selected cultivars based on differences in the accumulation of some primary metabolites, primarily sugars. This research highlights the potential usefulness of this approach to characterise rice varieties based on transcriptional or metabolic changes due to adverse environmental conditions.
23820171	Black rice anthocyanidins prevent retinal photochemical damage via involvement of the AP-1/NF-κB/Caspase-1 pathway in Sprague-Dawley rats.	2013	J Vet Sci	The effects of black rice anthocyanidins (BRACs) on retinal damage induced by photochemical stress are not well known. In the present study, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-93M for 1 week, after which 80 rats were randomly divided into two groups and treated with (n = 40) or without BRACs (n = 40) for 15 days, respectively. After treatment, both groups were exposed to fluorescent light (3,000 ± 200 lux; 25°C), and the protective effect of dietary BRACs were evaluated afterwards. Our results showed that dietary BRACs effectively prevented retinal photochemical damage and inhibited the retinal cells apoptosis induced by fluorescent light (p < 0.05). Moreover, dietary BRACs inhibited expression of AP-1 (c-fos/c-jun subunits), up-regulated NF-κB (p65) expression and phosphorylation of IκB-α, and decreased Caspase-1 expression (p < 0.05). These results suggest that BRACs improve retinal damage produced by photochemical stress in rats via AP-1/NF-κB/Caspase-1 apoptotic mechanisms.
23766367	RootNav: navigating images of complex root architectures.	2013	Plant Physiol	We present a novel image analysis tool that allows the semiautomated quantification of complex root system architectures in a range of plant species grown and imaged in a variety of ways. The automatic component of RootNav takes a top-down approach, utilizing the powerful expectation maximization classification algorithm to examine regions of the input image, calculating the likelihood that given pixels correspond to roots. This information is used as the basis for an optimization approach to root detection and quantification, which effectively fits a root model to the image data. The resulting user experience is akin to defining routes on a motorist's satellite navigation system: RootNav makes an initial optimized estimate of paths from the seed point to root apices, and the user is able to easily and intuitively refine the results using a visual approach. The proposed method is evaluated on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) images (and demonstrated on Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana], Brassica napus, and rice [Oryza sativa]), and results are compared with manual analysis. Four exemplar traits are calculated and show clear illustrative differences between some of the wheat accessions. RootNav, however, provides the structural information needed to support extraction of a wider variety of biologically relevant measures. A separate viewer tool is provided to recover a rich set of architectural traits from RootNav's core representation.
23731343	Nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of tobacco N receptor is modulated by SGT1.	2013	New Phytol	SGT1 (Suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1) is required to maintain plant disease Resistance (R) proteins with Nucleotide-Binding (NB) and Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domains in an inactive but signaling-competent state. SGT1 is an integral component of a multi-protein network that includes RACK1, Rac1, RAR1, Rboh, HSP90 and HSP70, and in rice the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), OsMAPK6. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) N protein, which belongs to the Toll-Interleukin Receptor (TIR)-NB-LRR class of R proteins, confers resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Following transient expression in planta, we analyzed the functional relationship between SGT1, SIPK - a tobacco MAPK6 ortholog - and N, using mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy and pathogen assays. Here, we show that tobacco SGT1 undergoes specific phosphorylation in a canonical MAPK target-motif by SIPK. Mutation of this motif to mimic SIPK phosphorylation leads to an increased proportion of cells displaying SGT1 nuclear accumulation and impairs N-mediated resistance to TMV, as does phospho-null substitution at the same residue. Forced nuclear localization of SGT1 causes N to be confined to nuclei. Our data suggest that one mode of regulating nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of R proteins is by maintaining appropriate levels of SGT1 phosphorylation catalyzed by plant MAPK.
23758479	Molecular phylogeny, homology modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation of race-specific bacterial blight disease resistance protein (xa5) of rice: a comparative agriproteomics approach.	2013	OMICS	Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a model plant belonging to the family Poaceae, is a staple food for a majority of the people worldwide. Grown in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, this important cereal crop is under constant and serious threat from both biotic and abiotic stresses. Among the biotic threats, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing the damaging bacterial blight disease in rice, is a prominent pathogen. The xa5 gene in the host plant rice confers race-specific resistance to this pathogen. This recessive gene belongs to the Xa gene family of rice and encodes a gamma subunit of transcription factor IIA (TFIIAγ). In view of the importance of this gene in conferring resistance to the devastating disease, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship of this gene, developed a three-dimensional protein model, followed by long-term molecular dynamics simulation studies to gain a better understanding of the evolution, structure, and function of xa5. The modeled structure was found to fit well with the small subunit of TFIIA from human, suggesting that it may also act as a small subunit of TFIIA in rice. The model had a stable conformation in response to the atomic flexibility and interaction, when subjected to MD simulation at 20 nano second in aqueous solution. Further structural analysis of xa5 indicated that the protein retained its basic transcription factor function, suggesting that it might govern a novel pathway responsible for bacterial blight resistance. Future molecular docking studies of xa5 underway with its corresponding avirulence gene is expected to shed more direct light into plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular level and thus pave the way for richer agriproteomic insights.
23489060	Contribution of small RNA pathway components in plant immunity.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Small RNAs regulate a multitude of cellular processes, including development, stress responses, metabolism, and maintenance of genome integrity, in a sequence-specific manner. Accumulating evidence reveals that host endogenous small RNAs and small RNA pathway components play important roles in plant immune responses against various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and viruses. Small-RNA-mediated defense responses are regulated through diverse pathways and the components of these pathways, including Dicer-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Argonaute proteins, and RNA polymerase IV and V, exhibit functional specificities as well as redundancy. In this review, we summarize the recent insights revealed mainly through the examination of two model plants, Arabidopsis and rice, with a primary focus on our emerging understanding of how these small RNA pathway components contribute to plant immunity.
23885202	A remarkable autosomal heteromorphism in Pseudoryzomys simplex 2n = 56; FN = 54-55 (Rodentia, Sigmodontinae).	2013	Genet Mol Biol	Pseudoryzomys simplex, the false rice rat, is a monotypic genus of the Oryzomyini tribe (Sigmodontinae) distributed in part of Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil. Its diploid number has been described as 56 acrocentric chromosomes decreasing in size and no karyotype figure has been depicted. Herein, we present karyotypic data on P. simplex, including chromosome banding and molecular fluorescent in situ hybridization using telomeric sequences and the whole X-chromosome of its sister clade Holochilus brasiliensis (HBR) as probes. A case of remarkable autosomal heteromorphism due to the presence of a whole heterochromatic arm leading to the variability of FN is reported, as well as the occurrence of regions of homology between the X and Y chromosomes (pseudoautosomal regions) after chromosome painting with the HBR X probe on P. simplex metaphases.
23755297	Molecular characterization and functions of fatty acid and retinoid binding protein gene (Ab-far-1) in Aphelenchoides besseyi.	2013	PLoS One	Rice white tip nematode, Aphelenchoides besseyi, is a kind of plant parasitic nematodes that cause serious losses in rice and many other crops. Fatty acid and retinoid binding protein (FAR) is a specific protein in nematodes and is related to development, reproduction, infection to the host, and disruption of plant defense reactions, so the inhibition of FAR function is the potential approach to control A. besseyi. The full-length of Ab-far-1 cDNA is 805 bp, including 546 bp of ORF that encodes 181 amino acids. Software analysis revealed that the Ab-FAR-1 was rich in α-helix structure, contained a predicted consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation site and a hydrophobic secretory signal peptide, but did not have glycosylation sites. The Ab-FAR-1 had 52% homology to Gp-FAR-1 protein. The Ab-FAR-1 and Gp-FAR-1 were grouped in the same branch according to the phylogenetic tree. Fluorescence-based ligand binding analysis confirmed that the recombinant Ab-FAR-1 (rAb-FAR-1) bound with the fluorescent analogues 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) amino) undecannoic acid (DAUDA), cis-parinaric acid and retinol, but the oleic acid would compete with the binding site. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to assess the expression level of Ab-far-1 at different development stages of A. besseyi, the highest expression was found in the females, followed by eggs, juveniles and males. Using in situ hybridization technique, Ab-far-1 mRNA was present in the hypodermis of juveniles and adults, the ovaries of females and the testes of males. When A. besseyi was treated with Ab-far-1 dsRNA for 48 h, the silencing efficiency of Ab-far-1 was the best and the number of nematodes on the carrot was the least. Thus FAR plays important roles in the development and reproduction of nematodes. This study is useful and helpful to figure out a new way to control the plant parasitic nematodes.
23816327	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice.	2013	J Plant Physiol	The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence. An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species. We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence. As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases. Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice. Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation. The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed.
23840426	Joint Association of Dietary Pattern and Physical Activity Level with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors among Chinese Men: A Cross-Sectional Study.	2013	PLoS One	The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the joint associations of physical activity level (PAL) and dietary patterns in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among Chinese men. The study population consisted of 13 511 Chinese males aged 18-59 years from the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey. Based on dietary data collected by a food frequency questionnaire, four dietary patterns were identified and labeled as "Green Water" (high consumption of rice, vegetables, seafood, pork, and poultry), "Yellow Earth" (high consumption of wheat flour products and starchy tubers), "New Affluent" (high consumption of animal sourced foods and soybean products), and "Western Adopter" (high consumption of animal sourced foods, cakes, and soft drinks). From the information collected by a 1-year physical activity questionnaire, PAL was calculated and classified into 4 categories: sedentary, low active, active, and very active. As compared with their counterparts from the New Affluent pattern, participants who followed the Green Water pattern had a lower likelihood of abdominal obesity (AO; 50.2%), hypertension (HT; 37.9%), hyperglycemia (HG; 41.5%), elevated triglyceride (ETG; 14.5%), low HDL (LHDL; 39.8%), and metabolic syndrome (MS; 51.9%). When compared to sedentary participants, the odds ratio of participants with very active PAL was 0.62 for AO, 0.85 for HT, 0.71 for HG, 0.76 for ETG, 0.74 for LHDL, and 0.58 for MS. Individuals who followed both very active PAL and the Green Water pattern had a lower likelihood of CVD risk factors (AO: 65.8%, HT: 39.1%, HG: 57.4%, ETG: 35.4%, LHDL: 56.1%, and MS: 75.0%), compared to their counterparts who followed both sedentary PAL and the New Affluent pattern. In addition, adherence to both healthy dietary pattern and very active PAL presented a remarkable potential for CVD risk factor prevention.
23799924	The complete mitochondrial genomes of two rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus: conserved genome rearrangement in Delphacidae and discovery of new characteristics of atp8 and tRNA genes.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Nilaparvata lugens (the brown planthopper, BPH) and Laodelphax striatellus (the small brown planthopper, SBPH) are two of the most important pests of rice. Up to now, there was only one mitochondrial genome of rice planthopper has been sequenced and very few dependable information of mitochondria could be used for research on population genetics, phylogeographics and phylogenetic evolution of these pests. To get more valuable information from the mitochondria, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of BPH and SBPH. These two planthoppers were infected with two different functional Wolbachia (intracellular endosymbiont) strains (wLug and wStri). Since both mitochondria and Wolbachia are transmitted by cytoplasmic inheritance and it was difficult to separate them when purified the Wolbachia particles, concomitantly sequencing the genome of Wolbachia using next generation sequencing method, we also got nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences of these two rice planthoppers. After gap closing, we present high quality and reliable complete mitochondrial genomes of these two planthoppers.

RESULTS: The mitogenomes of N. lugens (BPH) and L. striatellus (SBPH) are 17, 619 bp and 16, 431 bp long with A + T contents of 76.95% and 77.17%, respectively. Both species have typical circular mitochondrial genomes that encode the complete set of 37 genes which are usually found in metazoans. However, the BPH mitogenome also possesses two additional copies of the trnC gene. In both mitochondrial genomes, the lengths of the atp8 gene were conspicuously shorter than that of all other known insect mitochondrial genomes (99 bp for BPH, 102 bp for SBPH). That two rearrangement regions (trnC-trnW and nad6-trnP-trnT) of mitochondrial genomes differing from other known insect were found in these two distantly related planthoppers revealed that the gene order of mitochondria might be conservative in Delphacidae. The large non-coding fragment (the A+T-rich region) putatively corresponding responsible for the control of replication and transcription of mitochondria contained a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) block in different natural individuals of these two planthoppers. Comparison with a previously sequenced individual of SBPH revealed that the mitochondrial genetic variation within a species exists not only in the sequence and secondary structure of genes, but also in the gene order (the different location of trnH gene).

CONCLUSION: The mitochondrial genome arrangement pattern found in planthoppers was involved in rearrangements of both tRNA genes and protein-coding genes (PCGs). Different species from different genera of Delphacidae possessing the same mitochondrial gene rearrangement suggests that gene rearrangements of mitochondrial genome probably occurred before the differentiation of this family. After comparatively analyzing the gene order of different species of Hemiptera, we propose that except for some specific taxonomical group (e.g. the whiteflies) the gene order might have diversified in family level of this order. The VNTRs detected in the control region might provide additional genetic markers for studying population genetics, individual difference and phylogeographics of planthoppers.
23739066	Synthesis and characterization of rice straw/Fe3O4 nanocomposites by a quick precipitation method.	2013	Molecules	Small sized magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4-NPs) with were successfully synthesized on the surface of rice straw using the quick precipitation method in the absence of any heat treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O), ferrous chloride (FeCl2·4H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and urea (CH4N2O) were used as Fe3O4-NPs precursors, reducing agent and stabilizer, respectively. The rice straw fibers were dispersed in deionized water, and then urea was added to the suspension, after that ferric and ferrous chloride were added to this mixture and stirred. After the absorption of iron ions on the surface layer of the fibers, the ions were reduced with NaOH by a quick precipitation method. The reaction was carried out under N2 gas. The mean diameter and standard deviation of metal oxide NPs synthesized in rice straw/Fe3O4 nanocomposites (NCs) were 9.93 ± 2.42 nm. The prepared rice straw/Fe3O4-NCS were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXF) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT‒IR). The rice straw/Fe3O4-NCs prepared by this method have magnetic properties.
23767977	Facile one-step synthesis and transformation of Cu(I)-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystals to Cu(1.94)S-ZnS heterostructured nanocrystals.	2013	Langmuir	A facile one-pot heating process without any injection has been developed to synthesize different Cu-Zn-S-based nanocrystals. The composition of the products evolves from Cu(I)-doped ZnS (ZnS:Cu(I)) nanocrystals into heterostructured nanocrystals consisting of monoclinic Cu1.94S and wurtzite ZnS just by controlling the molar ratios of zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac)2) to copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) in the mixture of n-dodecanethiol (DDT) and 1-octadecene (ODE). Accompanying the composition transformation, the crystal phase of ZnS is changed from cubic zinc blende to hexagonal wurtzite. Depending on the synthetic parameters including the reaction time, temperature, and the feeding ratios of Zn/Cu precursors, the morphology of the as-obtained heterostructured nanocrystals can be controlled in the forms of taper-like, matchstick-like, tadpole-like, or rod-like. Interestingly, when the molar ratio of Cu(acac)2 to Zn(acac)2 is increased to 9:1, the crystal phase of the products is transformed from monoclinic Cu1.94S to the mixed phase composed of cubic Cu1.8S and tetragonal Cu1.81S as the reaction time is further prolonged. The crystal-phase transformation results in the morphological change from quasi-spherical to rice shape due to the incorporation of Zn ions into the Cu1.94S matrix. This method provides a simple but highly reproducible approach for synthesis of Cu(I)-doped nanocrystals and heterostructured nanocrystals, which are potentially useful in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.
23748354	Amylolytic activity and carbohydrate levels in relation to coleoptile anoxic elongation in Oryza sativa genotypes.	2013	J Plant Res	Among starchy seeds, rice has the unique capacity to germinate successfully under complete anaerobiosis. In this conditions, starch degradation is supported by a complete set of starch-degrading enzymes that are absent or inactive in cereals except rice. A characterization of carbohydrate metabolism and starch-degrading enzyme activity across twenty-nine genotypes of Oryza sativa L. is presented here. The zymogram of amylolytic activities present in rice embryos and endosperms under anaerobic conditions seven days after sowing (DAS) revealed marked differences among cultivars. Coleoptile elongation was positively correlated with total amylolytic activities and α-amylase activity in embryos, and negatively correlated with α-amylase activity in endosperm. Moreover, carbohydrate content in embryos was found to be positively correlated with total amylolytic activities under anaerobic conditions, while a negative relationship was recorded in the endosperm. Carbohydrate status in rice seedlings has a primary importance in sustaining coleoptile elongation towards the surface. The relationship between carbohydrate level in embryo and anoxic germination, as well as with total amylolytic activities present in rice embryo under anaerobic condition 7 DAS, is consistent with the role of sugar metabolism to support rice germination under oxygen-deprived environment.
23735506	Arabidopsis enhanced drought tolerance1/HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11 confers drought tolerance in transgenic rice without yield penalty.	2013	Plant Physiol	Enhancing drought tolerance without yield decrease has been a great challenge in crop improvement. Here, we report the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor Enhanced Drought Tolerance/HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11 (EDT1/HDG11) was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The improved drought tolerance was associated with a more extensive root system, reduced stomatal density, and higher water use efficiency. The transgenic rice plants also had higher levels of abscisic acid, proline, soluble sugar, and reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme activities during stress treatments. The increased grain yield of the transgenic rice was contributed by improved seed setting, larger panicle, and more tillers as well as increased photosynthetic capacity. Digital gene expression analysis indicated that AtEDT1/HDG11 had a significant influence on gene expression profile in rice, which was consistent with the observed phenotypes of transgenic rice plants. Our study shows that AtEDT1/HDG11 can improve both stress tolerance and grain yield in rice, demonstrating the efficacy of AtEDT1/HDG11 in crop improvement.
23749158	Acetylcholinesterase inhibition and in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of Ganoderma lucidum grown on germinated brown rice.	2013	Molecules	In this study, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition and in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities of Ganoderma lucidum grown on germinated brown rice (GLBR) were evaluated. In antioxidant assays in vitro, GLBR was found to have strong metal chelating activity, DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activity. Cell-based antioxidant methods were used, including lipid peroxidation on brain homogenate and AAPH-induced erythrocyte haemolysis. In antioxidant assays in vivo, mice were administered with GLBR and this significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the mice sera, livers and brains. The amount of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds were 43.14 mg GAE/g and 13.36 mg CE/g dry mass, respectively. GLBR also exhibited acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. In addition, HPLC analyses of GLBR extract revealed the presence of different phenolic compounds. These findings demonstrate the remarkable potential of GLBR extract as valuable source of antioxidants which exhibit interesting acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.
23761487	Functional analysis of the rice vacuolar zinc transporter OsMTP1.	2013	J Exp Bot	Heavy metal homeostasis is maintained in plant cells by specialized transporters which compartmentalize or efflux metal ions, maintaining cytosolic concentrations within a narrow range. OsMTP1 is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)/metal tolerance protein (MTP) family of metal cation transporters in Oryza sativa, which is closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MTP1. Functional complementation of the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant mtp1-1 demonstrates that OsMTP1 transports Zn in planta and localizes at the tonoplast. When heterologously expressed in the yeast mutant zrc1 cot1, OsMTP1 complemented its Zn hypersensitivity and was also localized to the vacuole. OsMTP1 alleviated, to some extent, the Co sensitivity of this mutant, rescued the Fe hypersensitivity of the ccc1 mutant at low Fe concentrations, and restored growth of the Cd-hypersensitive mutant ycf1 at low Cd concentrations. These results suggest that OsMTP1 transports Zn but also Co, Fe, and Cd, possibly with lower affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed two substitutions in OsMTP1 that alter the transport function of this protein. OsMTP1 harbouring a substitution of Leu82 to a phenylalanine can still transport low levels of Zn, with an enhanced affinity for Fe and Co, and a gain of function for Mn. A substitution of His90 with an aspartic acid completely abolishes Zn transport but improves Fe transport in OsMTP1. These amino acid residues are important in determining substrate specificity and may be a starting point for refining transporter activity in possible biotechnological applications, such as biofortification and phytoremediation.
23762023	Global expression profiling of transcription factor genes provides new insights into pathogenicity and stress responses in the rice blast fungus.	2013	PLoS Pathog	Because most efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning fungal pathogenicity have focused on studying the function and role of individual genes, relatively little is known about how transcriptional machineries globally regulate and coordinate the expression of a large group of genes involved in pathogenesis. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression patterns of 206 transcription factor (TF) genes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae under 32 conditions, including multiple infection-related developmental stages and various abiotic stresses. The resulting data, which are publicly available via an online platform, provided new insights into how these TFs are regulated and potentially work together to control cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli. High degrees of differential TF expression were observed under the conditions tested. More than 50% of the 206 TF genes were up-regulated during conidiation and/or in conidia. Mutations in ten conidiation-specific TF genes caused defects in conidiation. Expression patterns in planta were similar to those under oxidative stress conditions. Mutants of in planta inducible genes not only exhibited sensitive to oxidative stress but also failed to infect rice. These experimental validations clearly demonstrated the value of TF expression patterns in predicting the function of individual TF genes. The regulatory network of TF genes revealed by this study provides a solid foundation for elucidating how M. oryzae regulates its pathogenesis, development, and stress responses.
23748707	Embryo-specific expression of soybean oleosin altered oil body morphogenesis and increased lipid content in transgenic rice seeds.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Oleosin is the most abundant protein in the oil bodies of plant seeds, playing an important role in regulating oil body formation and lipid accumulation. To investigate whether lipid accumulation in transgenic rice seeds depends on the expression level of oleosin, we introduced two soybean oleosin genes encoding 24 kDa proteins into rice under the control of an embryo-specific rice promoter REG-2. Overexpression of soybean oleosin in transgenic rice leads to an increase of seed lipid content up to 36.93 and 46.06 % higher than that of the non-transgenic control, respectively, while the overall fatty acid profiles of triacylglycerols remained unchanged. The overexpression of soybean oleosin in transgenic rice seeds resulted in more numerous and smaller oil bodies compared with wild type, suggesting that an inverse relationship exists between oil body size and the total oleosin level. The increase in lipid content is accompanied by a reduction in the accumulation of total seed protein. Our results suggest that it is possible to increase rice seed oil content for food use and for use as a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel by overexpressing oleosin in rice seeds.
23803741	Diffuser-incorporated transmission NIR measurement for reliable analysis of packed granular samples.	2013	Analyst	A diffuser-incorporated transmission near-infrared (NIR) scheme that enables direct spectral collection of packed granular samples with reliable sample representation and reproducibility has been demonstrated. The analytical utility of this method has been evaluated for the determination of polyethylene (PE) pellet density and the discrimination of the geographical origin of rice samples. Based on the preliminary observation of transmission spectral features acquired from spherical polyoxymethylene (POM) packings composed of different particle sizes as well as packing thickness, a portion of the radiation was propagated through the void space in the packing without fully interacting with the POM pellets. This type of radiation, so-called non-fully interacted radiation (NFIR), adversely affected the sample representation as well as the reproducibility of transmission measurements. To maximize the interaction of NIR radiation with granular samples, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) diffuser was positioned in front of the sample packing to introduce isotropically diffused radiation into the sample. This diffuser-incorporated scheme resulted in highly reproducible transmission spectra for both packed granular samples. Consequently, the density determination of PE pellets as well as discrimination of rice samples according to geographical origin was more accurate using the proposed scheme.
23686299	[Current treatment concepts for muscular injuries].	2013	Unfallchirurg	Muscular lesions represent the most common form of sports injury. The four large muscle groups hamstrings, adductors, gastrocnemius and knee extensor muscles are most often affected. Most injuries occur during excentric tension impact. Diagnostics begin with an exact medical history and detailed clinical investigations. Imaging with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important to differentiate between structural lesions and functional disorders and to determine the extent of the injury. Most frequently treatment remains conservative and is oriented to the three phases of the healing process. In most cases (leisure sports) the rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) concept with subsequent pain-adapted load increase suffices for a return to sport activities. Infiltration therapy including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an additional therapy option but should not be used to accelerate the healing process. Surgical treatment only rarely becomes necessary for treatment of muscular injuries.
23795884	Picking sides: distinct roles for CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 in rice oryzalexin biosynthesis.	2013	Biochem J	Natural products biosynthesis often requires the action of multiple CYPs (cytochromes P450), whose ability to introduce oxygen, increasing solubility, is critical for imparting biological activity. In previous investigations of rice diterpenoid biosynthesis, we characterized CYPs that catalyse alternative hydroxylation of ent-sandaracopimaradiene, the precursor to the rice oryzalexin antibiotic phytoalexins. In particular, CYP76M5, CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 were all shown to carry out C-7β hydroxylation, whereas CYP701A8 catalyses C-3α hydroxylation, with oxy groups found at both positions in oryzalexins A-D, suggesting that these may act consecutively in oryzalexin biosynthesis. In the present paper, we report that, although CYP701A8 only poorly reacts with 7β-hydroxy-ent-sandaracopimaradiene, CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 readily react with 3α-hydroxy-ent-sandaracopimaradiene. Notably, their activity yields distinct products, resulting from hydroxylation at C-9β by CYP76M6 or C-7β by CYP76M8, on different sides of the core tricyclic ring structure. Thus CYP76M6 and CYP76M8 have distinct non-redundant roles in orzyalexin biosynthesis. Moreover, the resulting 3α,7β- and 3α,9β-diols correspond to oryzalexins D and E respectively. Accordingly, the results of the present study complete the functional identification of the biosynthetic pathway underlying the production of these bioactive phytoalexins. In addition, the altered regiochemistry catalysed by CYP76M6 following C-3α hydroxylation has some implications for its active-site configuration, offering further molecular insight.
23853514	Genetical and morphological characterization of cold tolerance at fertilization stage in rice.	2013	Breed Sci	Cold temperature during the reproductive phase leads to seed sterility, which reduces yield and decreases the grain quality of rice. The fertilization stage, ranging from pollen maturation to the completion of fertilization, is sensitive to unsuitable temperature. Improving cold tolerance at the fertilization stage (CTF) is an important objective of rice breeding program in cold temperature areas. In this study, we characterized fertilization behavior under cold temperature to define the phenotype of CTF and identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for CTF. A wide variation in CTF levels has been identified among local cultivars in Hokkaido, which is one of the most northern regions for rice cultivation in the world. Clear varietal differences in pollen germination, and pollen tube elongation due to cold temperature have been observed. These differences may confer a degree of CTF among this population. We conducted QTL analysis for CTF using 120 backcrossed inbred lines derived from a cross between Eikei88223 (vigorous CTF) and Suisei (very weak CTF). Three QTLs for CTF were identified. A clear effect by QTL, qCTF7, for increasing the level of CTF was validated using advanced progeny. These results will facilitate marker-assist selection for desirable QTLs for CTF in rice breeding program.
23792387	Soil contamination by phthalate esters in Chinese intensive vegetable production systems with different modes of use of plastic film.	2013	Environ Pollut	The concentrations of six priority phthalic acid esters (PAEs) in intensively managed suburban vegetable soils in Nanjing, east China, were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The total PAE concentrations in the soils ranged widely from 0.15 to 9.68 mg kg(-1) with a median value of 1.70 mg kg(-1), and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) were the most abundant phthalate esters. Soil PAE concentrations depended on the mode of use of plastic film in which PAEs were incorporated as plasticizing agents and both the plastic film and poultry manure appeared to be important sources of soil PAEs. Vegetables in rotation with flooded rice led to lower concentrations of PAEs in soil. The results indicate that agricultural plastic film can be an important source of soil PAE contamination and further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms of PAE contamination of intensive agricultural soils with different use modes of use of plastic film.
23792660	Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of un-detoxified rice hull hydrolysate by Saccharomyces cerevisiae ICV D254 and Spathaspora arborariae NRRL Y-48658 for the production of ethanol and xylitol.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Co-fermentation and simultaneous saccharification of rice hull hydrolysate (RHH) were investigated for the production of ethanol and xylitol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spathaspora arborariae, or the combination of both. In bioreactor cultures under oxygen limitation, S. cerevisiae was capable of metabolizing glucose from RHH, which contained small amounts of acetic acid, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural, achieving ethanol yields of 0.45 and concentrations of 10.5 g L(-1). In the co-culture of S. cerevisiae and S. arborariae pentoses and hexoses from RHH, were converted to ethanol and xylitol, with yields of 0.48 and 0.39, and concentrations of 11 g L(-1) and 3 g L(-1), respectively. The simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation using both yeasts produced ethanol and xylitol to final concentrations of 14.5 g L(-1) and 3 g L(-1), respectively. Results showed good prospects to use co-cultures of S. cerevisiae and S. arborariae for the bioconversion of RHH into ethanol and xylitol without further detoxification.
23825566	The rice NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase OsSRT1 targets preferentially to stress- and metabolism-related genes and transposable elements.	2013	PLoS One	Histone acetylation/deacetylation is an important chromatin modification for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Silent information regulation2 (Sir2)-related sirtuins are nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylases (HDAC). The mammalian sirtuin family comprises 7 members (SIRT1-7) that act in different cellular compartments to regulate metabolism and aging. The rice genome contains only two Sir2-related genes: OsSRT1 (or SRT701) and OsSRT2 (orSRT702). OsSRT1 is closely related to the mammalian SIRT6, while OsSRT2 is homologous to SIRT4. Previous work has shown that OsSRT1 is required for the safeguard against genome instability and cell damage in rice plant. In this work we investigated the role of OsSRT1 on genome-wide acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and studied the genome-wide binding targets of OsSRT1. The study reveals that OsSRT1 binds to loci with relatively low levels of H3K9ac and directly regulates H3K9ac and expression of many genes that are related to stress and metabolism, indicating that OsSRT1 is an important site-specific histone deacetylase for gene regulation in rice. In addition, OsSRT1 is found to also target to several families of transposable elements, suggesting that OsSRT1 is directly involved in transposable element repression.
23190115	Strong resistance against Rice grassy stunt virus is induced in transgenic rice plants expressing double-stranded RNA of the viral genes for nucleocapsid or movement proteins as targets for RNA interference.	2013	Phytopathology	Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV), a member of the genus Tenuivirus, causes significant economic losses in rice production in South, Southeast, and East Asian countries. Growing resistant varieties is the most efficient method to control RGSV; however, suitable resistance genes have not yet been found in natural rice resources. One of the most promising methods to confer resistance against RGSV is the use of RNA interference (RNAi). It is important to target viral genes that play important roles in viral infection and proliferation at an early stage of viral replication. Our recent findings obtained from an RNAi experiment with Rice stripe virus (RSV), a tenuivirus, revealed that the genes for nucleocapsid and movement proteins were appropriate targets for RNAi to confer resistance against RSV. In this study, we transformed rice plants by introducing an RNAi construct of the RGSV genes for the nucelocapsid protein pC5 or movement protein pC6. All progenies from self-fertilized transgenic plants had strong resistance against RGSV infection and did not allow the proliferation of RGSV. Thus, our strategy to target genes for nucleocapsid and movement proteins for conferring viral resistance might be applicable to the plant viruses in the genus Tenuivirus.
23717500	Members of the XB3 family from diverse plant species induce programmed cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana.	2013	PLoS One	Programmed cell death has been associated with plant immunity and senescence. The receptor kinase XA21 confers resistance to bacterial blight disease of rice (Oryza sativa) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Here we show that the XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3) is capable of inducing cell death when overexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. XB3 is a RING finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been positively implicated in XA21-mediated resistance. Mutation abolishing the XB3 E3 activity also eliminates its ability to induce cell death. Phylogenetic analysis of XB3-related sequences suggests a family of proteins (XB3 family) with members from diverse plant species. We further demonstrate that members of the XB3 family from rice, Arabidopsis and citrus all trigger a similar cell death response in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for these proteins in regulating programmed cell death in the plant kingdom.
23634840	The bacterial superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase are crucial for endophytic colonization of rice roots by Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus is an aerobic diazotrophic plant-growth-promoting bacterium isolated from different gramineous plants. We showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were produced at early stages of rice root colonization, a typical plant defense response against pathogens. The transcription of the pathogen-related-10 gene of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway but not of the PR-1 gene of the salicylic acid pathway was activated by the endophytic colonization of rice roots by G. diazotrophicus strain PAL5. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that, at early stages of colonization, the bacteria upregulated the transcript levels of ROS-detoxifying genes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR). To proof the role of ROS-scavenging enzymes in the colonization and interaction process, transposon insertion mutants of the SOD and GR genes of strain PAL5 were constructed. The SOD and GR mutants were unable to efficiently colonize the roots, indicated by the decrease of tightly root-associated bacterial cell counts and endophytic colonization and by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Interestingly, the mutants did not induce the PR-10 of the JA-pathway, probably due to the inability of endophytic colonization. Thus, ROS-scavenging enzymes of G. diazotrophicus strain PAL5 play an important role in the endophytic colonization of rice plants.
23686450	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Drought is one of the critical factors limiting reproductive yields of rice and other crops globally. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying reproductive development under drought stress in rice. To explore the potential gene function for improving rice reproductive development under drought, a drought induced gene, Oryza sativa Drought-Induced LTP (OsDIL) encoding a lipid transfer protein, was identified from our microarray data and selected for further study. OsDIL was primarily expressed in the anther and mainly responsive to abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, NaCl, and stress-related plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Compared with wild type, the OsDIL-overexpressing transgenic rice plants were more tolerant to drought stress during vegetative development and showed less severe tapetal defects and fewer defective anther sacs when treated with drought at the reproductive stage. The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated. Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought. Overexpression of OsDIL significantly enhanced drought resistance in transgenic rice during reproductive development, while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty under normal conditions. Therefore, OsDIL is an excellent candidate gene for genetic improvement of crop yield in adaption to unfavorable environments.
23672717	HrpE3 is a type III effector protein required for full virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola in rice.	2013	Mol Plant Pathol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, a devastating disease in rice. Xoc uses a type III secretion (T3S) system, which is encoded by the hrp-hrc-hpa (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity, hrp-conserved and hrp-associated) genes, to inject repertoires of T3S effectors (T3Es) into plant cells. Many of the hrp-hrc-hpa genes have roles in pathogenesis, but the role of hrpE3, which shows homology to hpaE in X. campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), is poorly understood. In this study, hrpE3 was shown to be transcribed independent of the hrpD operon, and its expression was dependent on a promoter within hpaB. The expression of hrpE3 was positively regulated by HrpG and HrpX, a finding probably caused by an imperfect plant-inducible promoter (PIP) box (TTCGT-N16 -TTCGA) in the hrpE3 promoter. The secretion of HrpE3 was dependent on T3S, and subcellular localization of HrpE3 was cytoplasmic and nuclear in plant cells. A mutation in hrpE3 reduced the virulence of Xoc by decreasing disease lesion length and bacterial growth in planta. Full virulence was restored to the mutant when Xoc hrpE3, but not Xcv hpaE, was expressed in trans. The differences in transcription, secretion via the T3S system and bacterial virulence in plants were attributed to N-terminal amino acid differences between Xoc HrpE3 and Xcv HpaE. Collectively, the results demonstrate that hrpE3 encodes a T3E protein which is delivered into the plant cell through the T3S system, localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is required for full virulence in rice.
23715017	Analysis of plastid and mitochondrial DNA insertions in the nucleus (NUPTs and NUMTs) of six plant species: size, relative age and chromosomal localization.	2013	Heredity (Edinb)	We analysed the size, relative age and chromosomal localization of nuclear sequences of plastid and mitochondrial origin (NUPTs-nuclear plastid DNA and NUMTs-nuclear mitochondrial DNA) in six completely sequenced plant species. We found that the largest insertions showed lower divergence from organelle DNA than shorter insertions in all species, indicating their recent origin. The largest NUPT and NUMT insertions were localized in the vicinity of the centromeres in the small genomes of Arabidopsis and rice. They were also present in other chromosomal regions in the large genomes of soybean and maize. Localization of NUPTs and NUMTs correlated positively with distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in Arabidopsis and sorghum, negatively in grapevine and soybean, and did not correlate in rice or maize. We propose a model where new plastid and mitochondrial DNA sequences are inserted close to centromeres and are later fragmented by TE insertions and reshuffled away from the centromere or removed by ectopic recombination. The mode and tempo of TE dynamism determines the turnover of NUPTs and NUMTs resulting in their species-specific chromosomal distributions.
23639970	Identification of an isogenic semidwarf rice cultivar carrying the Green Revolution sd1 gene by multiplex codominant ASP-PCR and SSR markers.	2013	Biochem Genet	The rice cultivar Hikarishinseiki, a semidwarf isogenotype of Koshihikari carrying the Green Revolution sd1 gene, is increasingly grown in both Japan and the United States. Here, we report DNA diagnosis for Hikarishinseiki targeting its Jukkoku-type sd1 locus, which codes for a defective gibberellin 20-oxidase, with a 1 bp substitution in exon 1 (Jukkoku-type GA20ox-2 mutant allele: Jukkoku_GA20ox-2). An allele-specific primer (ASP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers SD1F3 and SD1JR gave a PCR product specific to Jukkoku_GA20ox-2. In addition, ASP-PCR with primers SD1F3 and SD1NRM (which contains a mismatch at the third nucleotide from the 3'-terminus of SD1NR) gave a PCR product specific to non-Jukkoku_GA20ox-2. Multiplex ASP-PCR using SD1F3, VIC dye-labeled SD1JR, and FAM dye-labeled SD1NRM enabled simultaneous codominant detection of Jukkoku_GA20ox-2 and non-Jukkoku_GA20ox-2 among 188 cultivars. Also, Hikarishinseiki is identifiable by RM253 polymorphism from 11 cultivars carrying Jukkoku_GA20ox-2. Taken together, our results establish a methodology for distinguishing Hikarishinseiki.
23636694	Characterization of novel mutants with an altered gibberellin spectrum in comparison to different wild-type strains of Fusarium fujikuroi.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The rice pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi is known for producing a wide range of secondary metabolites such as pigments, mycotoxins, and a group of phytohormones, the gibberellic acids (GAs). Bioactive forms of these diterpenes are responsible for hyperelongation of rice stems, yellowish chlorotic leaves, and reduced grain formation during the bakanae disease leading to severely decreased crop yields. GAs are also successfully applied in agriculture and horticulture as plant growth regulators to enhance crop yields, fruit size, and to induce earlier flowering. In this study, six F. fujikuroi wild-type and mutant strains differing in GA yields and the spectrum of produced GAs were cultivated in high-quality lab fermenters for optimal temperature and pH control and compared regarding their growth, GA production, and GA gene expression levels. Comparative analysis of the six strains revealed that strain 6314/ΔDES/ΔPPT1, holding mutations in two GA biosynthetic genes and an additional deletion of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene PPT1, exhibits the highest total GA amount. Expression studies of two GA biosynthesis genes, CPS/KS and DES, showed a constantly high expression level for both genes under production conditions (nitrogen limitation) in all strains. By cultivating these genetically engineered mutant strains, we were able to produce not only mixtures of different bioactive GAs (GA3, GA4, and GA7) but also pure GA4 or GA7. In addition, we show that the GA yields are not only determined by different production rates, but also by different decomposition rates of the end products GA3, GA4, and GA7 explaining the varying GA levels of genetically almost identical mutant strains.
23718541	Two recently duplicated maize NAC transcription factor paralogs are induced in response to Colletotrichum graminicola infection.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: NAC transcription factors belong to a large family of plant-specific transcription factors with more than 100 family members in monocot and dicot species. To date, the majority of the studied NAC proteins are involved in the response to abiotic stress, to biotic stress and in the regulation of developmental processes. Maize NAC transcription factors involved in the biotic stress response have not yet been identified.

RESULTS: We have found that two NAC transcription factors, ZmNAC41 and ZmNAC100, are transcriptionally induced both during the initial biotrophic as well as the ensuing necrotrophic colonization of maize leaves by the hemibiotrophic ascomycete fungus C. graminicola. ZmNAC41 transcripts were also induced upon infection with C. graminicola mutants that are defective in host penetration, while the induction of ZmNAC100 did not occur in such interactions. While ZmNAC41 transcripts accumulated specifically in response to jasmonate (JA), ZmNAC100 transcripts were also induced by the salicylic acid analog 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA).To assess the phylogenetic relation of ZmNAC41 and ZmNAC100, we studied the family of maize NAC transcription factors based on the recently annotated B73 genome information. We identified 116 maize NAC transcription factor genes that clustered into 12 clades. ZmNAC41 and ZmNAC100 both belong to clade G and appear to have arisen by a recent gene duplication event. Including four other defence-related NAC transcription factors of maize and functionally characterized Arabidopsis and rice NAC transcription factors, we observed an enrichment of NAC transcription factors involved in host defense regulation in clade G. In silico analyses identified putative binding elements for the defence-induced ERF, Myc2, TGA and WRKY transcription factors in the promoters of four out of the six defence-related maize NAC transcription factors, while one of the analysed maize NAC did not contain any of these potential binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a systematic in silico analysis of maize NAC transcription factors in which we propose a nomenclature for maize genes encoding NAC transcription factors, based on their chromosomal position. We have further identified five pathogen-responsive maize NAC transcription factors that harbour putative binding elements for other defence-associated transcription factors in the proximal promoter region, indicating an involvement of the described NACs in the maize defence network. Our phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the majority of the yet described pathogen responsive NAC proteins from all plant species belong to clade G and suggests that they are phylogenetically related.
23691254	Comprehensive genome-wide survey, genomic constitution and expression profiling of the NAC transcription factor family in foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.).	2013	PLoS One	The NAC proteins represent a major plant-specific transcription factor family that has established enormously diverse roles in various plant processes. Aided by the availability of complete genomes, several members of this family have been identified in Arabidopsis, rice, soybean and poplar. However, no comprehensive investigation has been presented for the recently sequenced, naturally stress tolerant crop, Setaria italica (foxtail millet) that is famed as a model crop for bioenergy research. In this study, we identified 147 putative NAC domain-encoding genes from foxtail millet by systematic sequence analysis and physically mapped them onto nine chromosomes. Genomic organization suggested that inter-chromosomal duplications may have been responsible for expansion of this gene family in foxtail millet. Phylogenetically, they were arranged into 11 distinct sub-families (I-XI), with duplicated genes fitting into one cluster and possessing conserved motif compositions. Comparative mapping with other grass species revealed some orthologous relationships and chromosomal rearrangements including duplication, inversion and deletion of genes. The evolutionary significance as duplication and divergence of NAC genes based on their amino acid substitution rates was understood. Expression profiling against various stresses and phytohormones provides novel insights into specific and/or overlapping expression patterns of SiNAC genes, which may be responsible for functional divergence among individual members in this crop. Further, we performed structure modeling and molecular simulation of a stress-responsive protein, SiNAC128, proffering an initial framework for understanding its molecular function. Taken together, this genome-wide identification and expression profiling unlocks new avenues for systematic functional analysis of novel NAC gene family candidates which may be applied for improvising stress adaption in plants.
23718947	Identification of rice ethylene-response mutants and characterization of MHZ7/OsEIN2 in distinct ethylene response and yield trait regulation.	2013	Mol Plant	Ethylene plays essential roles in adaptive growth of rice plants in water-saturating environment; however, ethylene signaling pathway in rice is largely unclear. In this study, we report identification and characterization of ethylene-response mutants based on the specific ethylene-response phenotypes of etiolated rice seedlings, including ethylene-inhibited root growth and ethylene-promoted coleoptile elongation, which is different from the ethylene triple-response phenotype in Arabidopsis. We establish an efficient system for screening and a set of rice mutants have been identified. Genetic analysis reveals that these mutants form eight complementation groups. All the mutants show insensitivity or reduced sensitivity to ethylene in root growth but exhibit differential responses in coleoptile growth. One mutant group mhz7 has insensitivity to ethylene in both root and coleoptile growth. We identified the corresponding gene by a map-based cloning method. MHZ7 encodes a membrane protein homologous to EIN2, a central component of ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis. Upon ethylene treatment, etiolated MHZ7-overexpressing seedlings exhibit enhanced coleoptile elongation, increased mesocotyl growth and extremely twisted short roots, featuring enhanced ethylene-response phenotypes in rice. Grain length was promoted in MHZ7-transgenic plants and 1000-grain weight was reduced in mhz7 mutants. Leaf senescent process was also affected by MHZ7 expression. Manipulation of ethylene signaling may improve adaptive growth and yield-related traits in rice.
23733059	Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates submergence-dependent root hair development in rice plants.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	By using a forward genetic approach, a formin homology 1 gene (OsFH1) was identified as a critical regulator of rice root hair development. The phenotypic effect of OsFH1 on root hair development was verified by using three independent mutants, one point mutation and two T-DNA insertions. The study showed that OsFH1 is required for the elongation of root-hairs. However, Osfh1 exhibited growth defect of root hairs only when roots were grown submerged in solution. To understand how OsFH1 impinges on plant responses to root submergence, the growth responses of Osfh1 root hairs to anoxia, carbohydrate supplementation and exogenous hormones (auxin and ethylene) and nutrients (Fe and Pi) were examined. However, none of these treatments rescued the growth defects of Osfhl1 root hairs. This study demonstrates that OsFH1 could be involved in preventing submergence-induced inhibition of root hair growth.
23731869	Application of fungal laccase fused with cellulose-binding domain to develop low-lignin rice plants.	2013	J Biosci Bioeng	We observed a reduction of lignin content linked to the expression of fungal laccase in rice plants. The lignin content of L-4, which showed the highest LAC activity among transgenic lines produced, was lower than that of the control line. However, this change was not reflected to the saccharification efficiency.
23682119	Small GTPase Sar1 is crucial for proglutelin and α-globulin export from the endoplasmic reticulum in rice endosperm.	2013	J Exp Bot	Rice seed storage proteins glutelin and α-globulin are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and deposited in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). Sar1, a small GTPase, acts as a molecular switch to regulate the assembly of coat protein complex II, which exports secretory protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. To reveal the route by which glutelin and α-globulin exit the ER, four putative Sar1 genes (OsSar1a/b/c/d) were cloned from rice, and transgenic rice were generated with Sar1 overexpressed or suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) specifically in the endosperm under the control of the rice glutelin promoter. Overexpression or suppression of any OsSar1 did not alter the phenotype. However, simultaneous knockdown of OsSar1a/b/c resulted in floury and shrunken seeds, with an increased level of glutelin precursor and decreased level of the mature α- and β-subunit. OsSar1abc RNAi endosperm generated numerous, spherical, novel protein bodies with highly electron-dense matrixes containing both glutelin and α-globulin. Notably, the novel protein bodies were surrounded by ribosomes, showing that they were derived from the ER. Some of the ER-derived dense protein bodies were attached to a blebbing structure containing prolamin. These results indicated that OsSar1a/b/c play a crucial role in storage proteins exiting from the ER, with functional redundancy in rice endosperm, and glutelin and α-globulin transported together from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by a pathway mediated by coat protein complex II.
23697584	Natural food science based novel approach toward prevention and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes: recent studies on brown rice and γ-oryzanol.	None	Obes Res Clin Pract	The prevalences of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are dramatically increasing, and there is a strong need for more effective and safer therapies. However, some of drugs show limited efficacy and considerable adverse effects. Furthermore, artificial energy-dense foods and non-caloric foods may promote overeating and weight gain. In this context, a natural food-based approach may represent a valuable means of tackling the obesity-diabetes syndrome. Although recent studies have shown that brown rice improves glucose intolerance and prevents obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that one of the major components of brown rice, γ-oryzanol (Orz), plays an important role in the metabolically beneficial effects of brown rice. Orz acts as a chemical chaperone and decreases high fat diet (HFD)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus, thereby leading to a significant shift in preference from fatty to healthy foods. Orz also decreases HFD-induced ER stress in pancreatic β-cells and improves β-cell function. Notably, Orz directly acts on pancreatic islets and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This evidence highlights food preference as a promising therapeutic target in obesity-diabetes syndrome and suggests that brown rice and Orz may have potential for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans.
23703395	OsRMC, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	High salinity causes remarkable losses in rice productivity worldwide mainly because it inhibits growth and reduces grain yield. To cope with environmental changes, plants evolved several adaptive mechanisms, which involve the regulation of many stress-responsive genes. Among these, we have chosen OsRMC to study its transcriptional regulation in rice seedlings subjected to high salinity. Its transcription was highly induced by salt treatment and showed a stress-dose-dependent pattern. OsRMC encodes a receptor-like kinase described as a negative regulator of salt stress responses in rice. To investigate how OsRMC is regulated in response to high salinity, a salt-induced rice cDNA expression library was constructed and subsequently screened using the yeast one-hybrid system and the OsRMC promoter as bait. Thereby, two transcription factors (TFs), OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2, belonging to the AP2/ERF family were identified. Both TFs were shown to bind to the same GCC-like DNA motif in OsRMC promoter and to negatively regulate its gene expression. The identified TFs were characterized regarding their gene expression under different abiotic stress conditions. This study revealed that OsEREBP1 transcript level is not significantly affected by salt, ABA or severe cold (5 °C) and is only slightly regulated by drought and moderate cold. On the other hand, the OsEREBP2 transcript level increased after cold, ABA, drought and high salinity treatments, indicating that OsEREBP2 may play a central role mediating the response to different abiotic stresses. Gene expression analysis in rice varieties with contrasting salt tolerance further suggests that OsEREBP2 is involved in salt stress response in rice.
23661287	Single rice growth period was prolonged by cultivars shifts, but yield was damaged by climate change during 1981-2009 in China, and late rice was just opposite.	2013	Glob Chang Biol	Based on the crop trial data during 1981-2009 at 57 agricultural experimental stations across the North Eastern China Plain (NECP) and the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLRYR), we investigated how major climate variables had changed and how the climate change had affected crop growth and yield in a setting in which agronomic management practices were taken based on actual weather. We found a significant warming trend during rice growing season, and a general decreasing trend in solar radiation (SRD) in the MLRYR during 1981-2009. Rice transplanting, heading, and maturity dates were generally advanced, but the heading and maturity dates of single rice in the MLRYR (YZ_SR) and NECP (NE_SR) were delayed. Climate warming had a negative impact on growth period lengths at about 80% of the investigated stations. Nevertheless, the actual growth period lengths of YZ_SR and NE_SR, as well as the actual length of reproductive growth period (RGP) of early rice in the MLRYR (YZ_ER), were generally prolonged due to adoption of cultivars with longer growth period to obtain higher yield. In contrast, the actual growth period length of late rice in the MLRYR (YZ_LR) was shortened by both climate warming and adoption of early mature cultivars to prevent cold damage and obtain higher yield. During 1981-2009, climate warming and decrease in SRD changed the yield of YZ_ER by -0.59 to 2.4%; climate warming during RGP increased the yield of YZ_LR by 8.38-9.56%; climate warming and decrease in SRD jointly reduced yield of YZ_SR by 7.14-9.68%; climate warming and increase in SRD jointly increased the yield of NE_SR by 1.01-3.29%. Our study suggests that rice production in China has been affected by climate change, yet at the same time changes in varieties continue to be the major factor driving yield and growing period trends.
23634838	Rice yellow stunt rhabdovirus protein 6 suppresses systemic RNA silencing by blocking RDR6-mediated secondary siRNA synthesis.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The P6 protein of Rice yellow stunt rhabdovirus (RYSV) is a virion structural protein that can be phosphorylated in vitro. However its exact function remains elusive. We found that P6 enhanced the virulence of Potato virus X (PVX) in Nicotiana benthamiana and N. tabacum plants, suggesting that it might function as a suppressor of RNA silencing. We examined the mechanism of P6-mediated silencing suppression by transiently expressing P6 in both N. benthamiana leaves and rice protoplasts. Our results showed that P6 could repress the production of secondary siRNAs and inhibit systemic green fluorescent protein RNA silencing but did not interfere with local RNA silencing in N. benthamiana plants or in rice protoplasts. Intriguingly, P6 and RDR6 had overlapping subcellular localization and P6 bound both rice and Arabidopsis RDR6 in vivo. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants expressing P6 showed enhanced susceptibility to infection by Rice stripe virus. Hence, we propose that P6 is part of the RYSV's counter-defense machinery against the plant RNA silencing system and plays a role mainly in affecting RDR6-mediated secondary siRNA synthesis. Our work provides a new perspective on how a plant-infecting nucleorhabdovirus may counteract host RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defense.
23676354	Molecular cloning and characterization of the first caspase in the Striped Stem Borer, Chilo suppressalis.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Apoptosis is executed through the activity of the caspases that are aspartyl-specific proteases. In this study, we isolated the caspase gene (Cscaspase-1) of Chilo suppressalis (one of the leading pests responsible for destruction of rice crops). It possesses the open reading frame (ORF) of 295 amino acids including prodomain, large subunit and small subunits, and two cleavage sites (Asp23 and Asp194) were found to be located among them. In addition to these profiles, Cscaspase-1 contains two active sites (His134 and Cys176). Genomic analysis demonstrated there was no intron in the genome of Cscaspase-1. The Cscaspase-1 transcripts were found in all tissues of the fifth instar larvae, and higher levels were found in the midgut, hindgut and Malpighian tubules. Examination of Cscaspase-1 expression in different developmental stages indicated low constitutive levels in the eggs and early larvae stages, and higher abundances were exhibited in the last larvae and pupae stages. The relative mRNA levels of Cscaspase-1 were induced by heat and cold temperatures. For example, the highest increase of Cscaspase-1 transcription was at -3 °C and 36 °C respectively. In a word, Cscaspase-1 plays a role of effector in the apoptosis of C. suppressalis. It also correlates with development, metamorphosis and thermotolerance of C. suppreassalis.
23679139	Reaction pathways for the thermal decomposition of methyl butanoate.	2013	J Org Chem	In recent years, biodiesel fuels, consisting of long-chain alkyl (methyl, ethyl, propyl) esters, have emerged as viable alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. From a combustion chemistry standpoint, there is great interest in developing accurate reaction models for these new molecules that can be used to predict their behaviors in various regimes. In this paper, we report a detailed study of the unimolecular decomposition pathways of methyl butanoate (MB), a short-chain ester that contains the basic chemical structure of biodiesel fuels. Using ab initio/DFT methods, we identified five homolytic fissions of C-C and C-O bonds and five hydrogen transfer reactions. Rate constants were determined using the G3B3 theory coupled with both variational transition state theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus/master equation simulations with hindered rotation corrections. Branching ratios in the temperature range 1500-2200 K indicate that the main pathway for thermal decomposition of MB is the reaction CH3CH2CH2C(═O)OCH3 → C2H5 + CH2C(═O)OCH3. The results, in terms of reaction pathways and rate constants, can be used for future development of mechanisms for long alkyl-chain esters.
23645867	Solar rhythm in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering of long-day and short-day plants.	2013	J Exp Bot	In photoperiodic flowering, long-day (LD) plants are induced to flower seasonally when the daylight hours are long, whereas flowering in short-day (SD) plants is promoted under short photoperiods. According to the widely accepted external coincidence model, flowering occurs in LD Arabidopsis when the circadian rhythm of the gene CONSTANS (CO) peaks in the afternoon, when it is light during long days but dark when the days are short. Nevertheless, extending this explanation to SD flowering in rice, Oriza sativa, requires LD and SD plants to have 'opposite light requirements' as the CO orthologue in rice, HEADING-DATE1 (Hd1), promotes flowering only under short photoperiods. This report proposes a role of the plant's solar rhythm in promoting seasonal flowering. The interaction between rhythmic genes entrained to the solar clock and those entrained to the circadian clock form the basis of an internal coincidence model that explains both LD and SD flowering equally well. The model invokes no presumption of opposite light requirements between LD and SD plants, and further argues against any specific requirement of either light or darkness for SD flowering. Internal coincidence predicts the inhibition of SD flowering of the rice plant by a night break (a brief interruption of light), while it also provides a plausible explanation for how a judiciously timed night break promotes Arabidopsis flowering even on short days. It is the timing of the light transitions (sunrise and sunset) rather than the duration of light or darkness per se that regulates photoperiod-controlled flowering.
23659677	Amylase enzyme from Bacillus subtilis S8-18: a potential desizing agent from the marine environment.	None	Biotechnol Appl Biochem	The present study is aimed at developing an economical medium for the production of α-amylase from Bacillus subtilis S8-18, a marine sediment isolate from Palk Bay, with various agricultural by-products that are cheap and rich in starch. These products include wheat bran, wheat husk, rice bran, rice husk, and potato peel and are used to replace soluble starch present in the Luria Bertani (LB) broth (synthetic medium). The rice husk was found to be the best to influence enzyme production significantly (61,186 IU mL⁻¹) when compared with the yield of 30,026 IU mL⁻¹ obtained by commercial starch. Hence, LB broth containing rice husk was considered an economical medium. In addition, the effect of various nutritional and physiological factors on enzyme production was also investigated. Furthermore, the desizing efficiency of α-amylases produced by synthetic and economical media was evaluated through various assays like reducing sugar estimation, weight loss assay, drop absorbency assay, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared analyses. In addition, a commercial α-amylase from B. subtilis was also used in desizing analyses for comparative purposes. It revealed that the α-amylase from the economical medium was as effective in desizing the cotton fabrics as that of the commercial enzyme and much superior to the enzyme produced through the synthetic medium.
23770592	Analysis of rice Snf2 family proteins and their potential roles in epigenetic regulation.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Snf2 family proteins are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors that control many aspects of DNA events such as transcription, replication, homologous recombination and DNA repair. In animals several members in this family have been revealed to control gene expression in concert with other epigenetic mechanisms including histone modification, histone variants and DNA methylation. Their function in regulating genome expression in plant has hardly been disclosed before except in Arabidopsis. Here we identified 40 members of this family in the rice (Oryza Sativa) genome and constructed a phylogenetic tree together with Arabidopsis 41 Snf2 proteins. Sequence alignment of the Snf2 helicase regions revealed conserved motifs and blocks in most proteins. Expression profile analysis indicates that many rice Snf2 family genes show a tissue-specific expression pattern and some of them respond to abiotic stresses including drought, salt and cold. The results provide a basis for further analysis of their roles in epigenetic regulation to control rice development.
23672828	Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome caused by rice beverage.	2013	Ital J Pediatr	Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is an uncommon and potentially severe non IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy. It is usually caused by cow's milk or soy proteins, but may also be triggered by ingestion of solid foods. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical history and symptoms. Management of acute phase requires fluid resuscitation and intravenous steroids administration, but avoidance of offending foods is the only effective therapeutic option.Infant with FPIES presented to our emergency department with vomiting, watery stools, hypothension and metabolic acidosis after ingestion of rice beverage. Intravenous fluids and steroids were administered with good clinical response. Subsequently, a double blind placebo control food challenge (DBPCFC) was performed using rice beverage and hydrolyzed formula (eHF) as placebo. The "rice based formula" induced emesis, diarrhoea and lethargy. Laboratory investigations reveal an increase of absolute count of neutrophils and the presence of faecal eosinophils. The patient was treated with both intravenous hydration and steroids. According to Powell criteria, oral food challenge was considered positive and diagnosis of FPIES induced by rice beverage was made. Patient was discharged at home with the indication to avoid rice and any rice beverage as well as to reintroduce hydrolyzed formula. A case of FPIES induced by rice beverage has never been reported. The present case clearly shows that also beverage containing rice proteins can be responsible of FPIES. For this reason, the use of rice beverage as cow's milk substitute for the treatment of non IgE-mediated food allergy should be avoided.
23667043	Introduction of the rice CYP714D1 gene into Populus inhibits expression of its homologous genes and promotes growth, biomass production and xylem fibre length in transgenic trees.	2013	J Exp Bot	The rice (Oryza sativa) OsCYP714D1 gene (also known as EUI) encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase which functions as a gibberellin (GA)-deactivating enzyme, catalysing 16α, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs. To understand whether it would also reduce the production of active GAs and depress the growth rate in transgenic trees, we constitutively expressed OsCYP714D1 in the aspen hybrid clone Populus alba×P. berolinensis. Unexpectedly, ectopic expression of OsCYP714D1 in aspen positively regulated the biosynthesis of GAs, including the active GA1 and GA4, leading to promotion of the growth rate and biomass production in transgenic plants. Transgenic lines which showed significant expression of the introduced OsCYP714D1 gene accumulated a higher GA level and produced more numerous and longer xylem fibres than did the wild-type plants. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that transcription of most homologous PtCYP714 genes was suppressed in these transgenic lines. Therefore, the promoted GA and biomass production in transgenic trees constitutively expressing OsCYP714D1 is probably attributed to the down-regulated expression of the native PtCYP714 homologues involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway, although their precise functions are yet to be further elucidated.
23674687	LYM2-dependent chitin perception limits molecular flux via plasmodesmata.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Chitin acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern from fungal pathogens whose perception triggers a range of defense responses. We show that LYSIN MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-ANCHORED PROTEIN 2 (LYM2), the Arabidopsis homolog of a rice chitin receptor-like protein, mediates a reduction in molecular flux via plasmodesmata in the presence of chitin. For this response, lym2-1 mutants are insensitive to the presence of chitin, but not to the flagellin derivative flg22. Surprisingly, the chitin-recognition receptor CHITIN ELCITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) is not required for chitin-induced changes to plasmodesmata flux, suggesting that there are at least two chitin-activated response pathways in Arabidopsis and that LYM2 is not required for CERK1-mediated chitin-triggered defense responses, indicating that these pathways are independent. In accordance with a role in the regulation of intercellular flux, LYM2 is resident at the plasma membrane and is enriched at plasmodesmata. Chitin-triggered regulation of molecular flux between cells is required for defense responses against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, and thus we conclude that the regulation of symplastic continuity and molecular flux between cells is a vital component of chitin-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis.
23689259	Fine mapping of BH1, a gene controlling lemma and palea development in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A new rice floral organ mutant bh1 , had a negative effect on grain yield. BH1 was fine mapped to 87.5 kb on chr2. A 55 kb chromosome segment was deleted in bh1. The cereal spikelet is enclosed by the lemma and palea. The lemma and palea of the floral mutant designated bh1, a selection from a T-DNA library generated from the rice cultivar Asominori, takes on an abnormal curve-shaped appearance only late in floral development, finally forming a beak-shaped hull. The mutation had a negative effect on thousand grain weight, seed set rate and germination rate. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype was determined by a single recessive gene. Through map-based approach, BH1 gene was finally located to a ~87.5-kbp region on the long arm of chromosome 2. An analysis of the gene content of this region indicated that the mutation involves the loss of a 55-kbp stretch, harboring four open reading frames. Transcription profiling based on qRT-PCR revealed that the genes OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, REP1, CFO1, and DL, all of which are also involved in lemma and palea development and identity specification, were down-regulated in the bh1 mutant. BH1 is therefore an important floral organ development gene.
23717458	Identification of drought tolerance markers in a diverse population of rice cultivars by expression and metabolite profiling.	2013	PLoS One	Rice provides about half of the calories consumed in Asian countries, but its productivity is often reduced by drought, especially when grown under rain-fed conditions. Cultivars with increased drought tolerance have been bred over centuries. Slow selection for drought tolerance on the basis of phenotypic traits may be accelerated by using molecular markers identified through expression and metabolic profiling. Previously, we identified 46 candidate genes with significant genotype × environment interaction in an expression profiling study on four cultivars with contrasting drought tolerance. These potential markers and in addition GC-MS quantified metabolites were tested in 21 cultivars from both indica and japonica background that varied in drought tolerance. Leaf blades were sampled from this population of cultivars grown under control or long-term drought condition and subjected to expression analysis by qRT-PCR and metabolite profiling. Under drought stress, metabolite levels correlated mainly negatively with performance parameters, but eight metabolites correlated positively. For 28 genes, a significant correlation between expression level and performance under drought was confirmed. Negative correlations were predominant. Among those with significant positive correlation was the gene coding for a cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This enzyme catalyzes a highly regulated step in C-metabolism. The metabolic and transcript marker candidates for drought tolerance were identified in a highly diverse population of cultivars. Thus, these markers may be used to select for tolerance in a wide range of rice germplasms.
23713079	Natural variation in OsPRR37 regulates heading date and contributes to rice cultivation at a wide range of latitudes.	2013	Mol Plant	Heading date and photoperiod sensitivity are fundamental traits that determine rice adaptation to a wide range of geographic environments. By quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and candidate gene analysis using whole-genome re-sequencing, we found that Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) is responsible for the Early heading7-2 (EH7-2)/Heading date2 (Hd2) QTL which was identified from a cross of late-heading rice 'Milyang23 (M23)' and early-heading rice 'H143'. H143 contains a missense mutation of an invariantly conserved amino acid in the CCT (CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1) domain of PRR37 protein. In the world rice collection, different types of nonfunctional PRR37 alleles were found in many European and Asian rice cultivars. Notably, the japonica varieties harboring nonfunctional alleles of both Ghd7/Hd4 and PRR37/Hd2 flower extremely early under natural long-day conditions, and are adapted to the northernmost regions of rice cultivation, up to 53° N latitude. Genetic analysis revealed that the effects of PRR37 and Ghd7 alleles on heading date are additive, and PRR37 down-regulates Hd3a expression to suppress flowering under long-day conditions. Our results demonstrate that natural variations in PRR37/Hd2 and Ghd7/Hd4 have contributed to the expansion of rice cultivation to temperate and cooler regions.
23695503	LcSAIN1, a novel salt-induced gene from sheepgrass, confers salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Previously, we identified >1,500 genes that were induced by high salt stress in sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis, Gramineae: Triticeae) when comparing the changes in their transcription levels in response to high salt stress by next-generation sequencing. Among the identified genes, a gene of unknown function (designated as Leymus chinensis salt-induced 1, LcSAIN1) showed a high sequence identity to its homologs from wheat, Hordeum vulgare and Oryza sativa, but LcSAIN1 and its homologs produce hypothetical proteins with no conserved functional domains. Transcription of the LcSAIN1 gene was up-regulated by various stresses. The overexpression of LcSAIN1 in Arabidopsis and rice increased the greening rate of cotyledons, the fresh weight, root elongation, plant height and the plant survival rate when compared with control plants and conferred a tolerance against salt stress. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that LcSAIN1 is localized predominantly in the nucleus. Our results show that the LcSAIN1 gene might play an important positive modulation role in increasing the expression of transcription factors (MYB2 and DREB2A) and functional genes (P5CS and RAB18) in transgenic plants under salt stress and that it augments stress tolerance through the accumulation of compatible solutes (proline and soluble sugar) and the alleviation of changes in reactive oxygen species. The LcSAIN1 gene could be a potential resource for engineering salinity tolerance in important crop species.
23782215	Discrimination between two rice metallothionein isoforms belonging to type 1 and type 4 in metal-binding ability.	None	Biotechnol Appl Biochem	Metallothioneins (MTs) are a superfamily of low-molecular-weight, cysteine (Cys)-rich proteins that are believed to play important roles in protection against metal toxicity and oxidative stress. Plants have several MT isoforms, which are classified into four types based on the arrangement of Cys residues. In this study, two rice (Oryza sativa) MT isoforms, OsMTI-1b and OsMTII-1a from type 1 and type 4, respectively, were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Transformed cells expressing GST-OsMTI-1b showed increased tolerance to Ni(2+) , Cd(2+) , and Zn(2+) and accumulated more metal ions compared with cells expressing GST alone. However, heterologous expression of GST-OsMTII-1a had no significant effects on metal tolerance or ion accumulation. The UV absorption spectra and competitive reactions of in vitro Cd-incubated proteins with 5-5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid revealed that GST-OsMTI-1b, but not GST-OsMTII-1a, is able to form Cd-thiolate clusters. Furthermore, heterologous expression of both GST-OsMTI-1b and GST-OsMTII-1a conferred H2 O2 tolerance to E. coli cells. Taken together, the results presented here show that two different rice MT isoforms belonging to type 1 and type 4 differ in Ni(2+) , Cd(2+) , and Zn(2+) binding abilities, but they may have overlapping function in protection of cells against oxidative stress.
23675421	Xuezhikang, extract of red yeast rice, improved abnormal hemorheology, suppressed caveolin-1 and increased eNOS expression in atherosclerotic rats.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Xuezhikang is the extract of red yeast rice, which has been widely used for the management of atherosclerotic disease, but the molecular basis of its antiatherosclerotic effects has not yet been fully identified. Here we investigated the changes of eNOS in vascular endothelia and RBCs, eNOS regulatory factor Caveolin-1 in endothelia, and hemorheological parameters in atherosclerotic rats to explore the protective effects of Xuezhikang.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 12/group) group C, controls; group M, high-cholesterol diet (HCD) induced atherosclerotic models; group X, HCD+Xuezhikang; and group L, HCD +Lovastatin. In group X, Xuezhikang inhibited oxidative stress, down-regulated caveolin-1 in aorta wall (P<0.05), up-regulated eNOS expression in vascular endothelia and erythrocytes (P<0.05), increased NOx (nitrite and nitrate) in plasma and cGMP in erythrocyte plasma and aorta wall (P<0.05), increased erythrocyte deformation index (EDI), and decreased whole blood viscosity and plasma viscosity (P<0.05), with the improvement of arterial pathology.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Xuezhikang up-regulated eNOS expression in vascular endothelia and RBCs, increased plasma NOx and improved abnormal hemorheology in high cholesterol diet induced atherosclerotic rats. The elevated eNOS/NO and improved hemorheology may be beneficial to atherosclerotic disease.
23694780	Allergenic potential of rice-pollen proteins: expression, immuno-cross reactivity and IgE-binding.	2013	J Biochem	Pollen proteins from several grass species have been identified and characterized as causative allergens in grass pollinosis. In contrast, allergenic potential of pollen proteins from rice, which belongs to the same Poaceae family, has not well been investigated, despite that a few clinical cases have been reported on rice-pollen allergy. In this study, to characterize expression and allergenic potential of pollen proteins from rice (Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica), rice putative proteins for β-expansin (EXP), a Ca(2+)-binding protein (CBP)/polcalcin, extensin (EXT), profilin (PRF) and polygalacturonase (PGA) retrieved from a rice complete cDNA database were prepared as recombinant proteins, and the antibodies to these recombinant proteins were obtained. Immuno-blotting and immuno-histological analyses showed that rice putative EXP, EXT and PGA were expressed abundantly in anther tissue and pollen granules and immuno-cross reactive with pollen proteins from timothy grass. ELISA and immuno-dot blotting analyses using serum specimens from allergic patients showed that majority of the specimens was positive in the IgE-binding to EXP and EXT, but weakly to PGA and almost negative to PRF. EXP and EXT were suggested to be potentially allergenic in the rice-pollen allergy as well as the grass pollinosis.
23650998	GS6, a member of the GRAS gene family, negatively regulates grain size in rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	Grain size is an important yield-related trait in rice. Intensive artificial selection for grain size during domestication is evidenced by the larger grains of most of today's cultivars compared with their wild relatives. However, the molecular genetic control of rice grain size is still not well characterized. Here, we report the identification and cloning of Grain Size 6 (GS6), which plays an important role in reducing grain size in rice. A premature stop at the +348 position in the coding sequence (CDS) of GS6 increased grain width and weight significantly. Alignment of the CDS regions of GS6 in 90 rice materials revealed three GS6 alleles. Most japonica varieties (95%) harbor the Type I haplotype, and 62.9% of indica varieties harbor the Type II haplotype. Association analysis revealed that the Type I haplotype tends to increase the width and weight of grains more than either of the Type II or Type III haplotypes. Further investigation of genetic diversity and the evolutionary mechanisms of GS6 showed that the GS6 gene was strongly selected in japonica cultivars. In addition, a "ggc" repeat region identified in the region that encodes the GRAS domain of GS6 played an important historic role in the domestication of grain size in rice. Knowledge of the function of GS6 might aid efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control grain development and evolution in rice plants, and could facilitate the genetic improvement of rice yield.
23656875	Salt overly sensitive pathway members are influenced by diurnal rhythm in rice.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The diurnal rhythm controls many aspects of plant physiology such as flowering, photosynthesis and growth. Rice is one of the staple foods for world's population. Abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, heat and cold severely affect rice production. Under salinity stress, maintenance of ion homeostasis is a major challenge, which also defines the tolerance level of a given genotype. Salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is well documented to play a key role in maintaining the Na(+) homeostasis in plant cell. However, it is not reported yet whether the transcriptional regulation of genes of this pathway are influenced by diurnal rhythm. In the present work, we have studied the diurnal pattern of transcript abundance of SOS pathway genes in rice at seedling stage.To rule out the effect of temperature fluctuations on the expression patterns of these genes, the seedlings were grown under constant temperature. We found that OsSOS3 and OsSOS2 exhibited a rhythmic and diurnal expression pattern, while OsSOS1did not have any specific pattern of expression. This analysis establishes a cross-link between diurnal rhythm and SOS pathway and suggests that SOS pathway is influenced by diurnal rhythm in rice.
23750161	Disruption of a rice gene for α-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth.	2013	Front Plant Sci	To identify potential regulators of photoassimilate partitioning, we screened for rice mutant plants that accumulate high levels of starch in the leaf blades, and a mutant line leaf starch excess 1 (LSE1) was obtained and characterized. The starch content in the leaf blades of LSE1 was more than 10-fold higher than that in wild-type plants throughout the day, while the sucrose content was unaffected. The gene responsible for the LSE1 phenotype was identified by gene mapping to be a gene encoding α-glucan water dikinase, OsGWD1 (Os06g0498400), and a 3.4-kb deletion of the gene was found in the mutant plant. Despite the hyperaccumulation of starch in their leaf blades, LSE1 plants exhibited no significant change in vegetative growth, presenting a clear contrast to the reported mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana and Lotus japonicus in which disruption of the genes for α-glucan water dikinase leads to marked inhibition of vegetative growth. In reproductive growth, however, LSE1 exhibited fewer panicles per plant, lower percentage of ripened grains and smaller grains; consequently, the grain yield was lower in LSE1 plants than in wild-type plants by 20~40%. Collectively, although α-glucan water dikinase was suggested to have universal importance in leaf starch degradation in higher plants, the physiological priority of leaf starch in photoassimilate allocation may vary among plant species.
23738013	Rice mitogen activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase interaction network revealed by in-silico docking and yeast two-hybrid approaches.	2013	PLoS One	Protein-protein interaction is one of the crucial ways to decipher the functions of proteins and to understand their role in complex pathways at cellular level. Such a protein-protein interaction network in many crop plants remains poorly defined owing largely to the involvement of high costs, requirement for state of the art laboratory, time and labour intensive techniques. Here, we employed computational docking using ZDOCK and RDOCK programmes to identify interaction network between members of Oryza sativa mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). The 3-dimentional (3-D) structures of five MAPKKs and eleven MAPKs were determined by homology modelling and were further used as input for docking studies. With the help of the results obtained from ZDOCK and RDOCK programmes, top six possible interacting MAPK proteins were predicted for each MAPKK. In order to assess the reliability of the computational prediction, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analyses were performed using rice MAPKKs and MAPKs. A direct comparison of Y2H assay and computational prediction of protein interaction was made. With the exception of one, all the other MAPKK-MAPK pairs identified by Y2H screens were among the top predictions by computational dockings. Although, not all the predicted interacting partners could show interaction in Y2H, yet, the harmony between the two approaches suggests that the computational predictions in the present work are reliable. Moreover, the present Y2H analyses per se provide interaction network among MAPKKs and MAPKs which would shed more light on MAPK signalling network in rice.
23708376	Effect of ultraviolet-B radiation in laboratory on morphological and ultrastructural characteristics and physiological parameters of selected cultivar of Oryza sativa L.	2013	Protoplasma	Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) affects plants in many important ways, including reduction of growth rate and primary productivity, and changes in ultrastructures. Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most cultivated cereals in the world, along with corn and wheat, representing over 50% of agricultural production. In this study, we examined O. sativa plants exposed to ambient outdoor radiation and laboratory-controlled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and PAR + UVBR conditions for 2 h/day during 30 days of cultivation. The samples were studied for morphological and ultrastructural characteristics, and physiological parameters. PAR + UVBR caused changes in the ultrastructure of leaf of O. sativa and leaf morphology (leaf index, leaf area and specific leaf area, trichomes, and papillae), plant biomass (dry and fresh weight), photosynthetic pigments, phenolic compounds, and protein content. As a photoprotective acclimation strategy against PAR + UVBR damage, an increase of 66.24% in phenolic compounds was observed. Furthermore, PAR + UVBR treatment altering the levels of chlorophylls a and b, and total chlorophyll. In addition, total carotenoid contents decreased after PAR + UVBR treatment. The results strongly suggested that PAR + UVBR negatively affects the ultrastructure, morphology, photosynthetic pigments, and growth rates of leaf of O. sativa and, in the long term, it could affect the viability of this economically important plant.
23702967	Five small heat shock protein genes from Chilo suppressalis: characteristics of gene, genomic organization, structural analysis, and transcription profiles.	2014	Cell Stress Chaperones	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are the most diverse but also the most poorly known family of molecular chaperones, and they play essential roles in various biological processes. The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most serious pests of rice, causing extensive damage and yield loss. In this study, we isolated and characterized five members of the sHSPs family-Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b-from C. suppressalis. The cDNAs of these genes encoded proteins of 177, 187, 191, 191, and 191 amino acids with isoelectric points of 7.0, 5.6, 6.1, 6.3, and 6.3, respectively. While Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b had no introns, Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a contained one and two introns, respectively. Structural analysis indicated that all five Cshsps possessed conserved arginine and a V/IXI/V motif, which is related to hydrophobic characteristics of sHSPs. The five heat shock proteins can be classified into two main groups: an orthologous type (Cshsp21.4 and Cshsp21.7a) and a species-specific type (Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.5, Cshsp21.7a, and Cshsp21.7b all exhibited their highest expression levels within Malpighian tubules or the hindgut, while such levels were found in the head for Cshsp21.4. The expression of Csshsps at different developmental stages revealed that the mRNA levels of Cshsp19.8, Cshsp21.4, Cshsp21.5, and Cshsp21.7b peaked in adults, whereas the highest level of Cshsp21.7a was observed in first instar larvae. Cshsp19.8 and Cshsp21.7b were both upregulated dramatically by heat and cold, and Cshsp21.5 could be induced by cold stress. Neither Cshsp21.4 nor Cshsp21.7a responded to heat or cold. These results demonstrated that different Csshsps play distinctive roles in the regulation of the physiological activities in C. suppressalis.
23665591	Temporal analysis of the magnaporthe oryzae proteome during conidial germination and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated appressorium formation.	2013	Mol Cell Proteomics	Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most serious threats to global rice production. During the earliest stages of rice infection, M. oryzae conidia germinate on the leaf surface and form a specialized infection structure termed the appressorium. The development of the appressorium represents the first critical stage of infectious development. A total of 3200 unique proteins were identified by nanoLC-MS/MS in a temporal study of conidial germination and cAMP-induced appressorium formation in M. oryzae. Using spectral counting based label free quantification, observed changes in relative protein abundance during the developmental process revealed changes in the cell wall biosynthetic machinery, transport functions, and production of extracellular proteins in developing appressoria. One hundred and sixty-six up-regulated and 208 down-regulated proteins were identified in response to cAMP treatment. Proteomic analysis of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A mutant that is compromised in the ability to form appressoria identified proteins whose developmental regulation is dependent on cAMP signaling. Selected reaction monitoring was used for absolute quantification of four regulated proteins to validate the global proteomics data and confirmed the germination or appressorium specific regulation of these proteins. Finally, a comparison of the proteome and transcriptome was performed and revealed little correlation between transcript and protein regulation. A subset of regulated proteins were identified whose transcripts show similar regulation patterns and include many of the most strongly regulated proteins indicating a central role in appressorium formation. A temporal quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a strong correlation between transcript and protein abundance for some but not all genes. Collectively, the data presented here provide the first comprehensive view of the M. oryzae proteome during early infection-related development and highlight biological processes important for pathogenicity.
23766026	A genome-wide analysis of the ERF gene family in sorghum.	2013	Genet Mol Res	The ethylene response factor (ERF) family are members of the APETALA2 (AP2)/ERF transcription factor superfamily; they are known to play an important role in plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. ERF genes have been studied in Arabidopsis, rice, grape, and maize; however, there are few reports of ERF genes in sorghum. We identified 105 sorghum ERF (SbERF) genes, which were categorized into 12 groups (A-1 to A-6 and B-1 to B-6) based on their sequence similarity, and this new method of classification for ERF genes was then further characterized. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of SbERF genes was performed using a sorghum genomic database, to analyze the phylogeny of SbERF genes, identify other conserved motifs apart from the AP2/ERF domain, map SbERF genes to the 10 sorghum chromosomes, and determine the tissue-specific expression patterns of SbERF genes. Gene clustering indicates that SbERF genes were generated by tandem duplications. Comparison of SbERF genes with maize ERF homologs suggests lateral gene transfer between monocot species. These results can contribute to our understanting of the evolution of the ERF gene family.
23718837	Fine mapping and identification of blast resistance gene Pi-hk1 in a broad-spectrum resistant japonica rice landrace.	2013	Phytopathology	One Japonica rice landrace, Heikezijing, from the Taihu Lake region of China, exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast. As characterized in our previous research, a main-effect resistance (R) gene, Pi-hk1, in Heikezijing against five isolates (GD10-279a, JS2004-141-1, JS2004-185, JS90-78, and Hoku1) was roughly mapped on the long arm of chromosome 11. To fine map Pi-hk1, one recombinant inbred line (RIL), RIL72 (F2:8), from the cross between Heikezijing and blast-susceptible variety Suyunuo, was further crossed and backcrossed with Suyunuo to produce a BC1F2 population of 477 individuals. Inoculation experiments with the representative isolate Hoku 1 indicated that RIL72 carries a single dominant R gene for blast resistance. With the help of advanced BC1F3 (915 plants), BC1F4 (4,459 plants), and BC1F5 (2,000 plants) mapping populations, Pi-hk1 was finally mapped to a 107-kb region between molecular markers P3586 and ILP3, and co-segregated with the markers P4098, RM7654, and P4099. By sequence analysis of Heikezijing bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering Pi-hk1 region, 16 predicted genes were identified within this region, including three nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat candidate genes. These results provide essential information for cloning of Pi-hk1 and its application in rice breeding for broad-spectrum blast resistance by marker-assisted selection.
23651319	Overexpression of microRNA319 impacts leaf morphogenesis and leads to enhanced cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Plant Cell Environ	MicroRNA319 (miR319) family is one of the conserved microRNA (miRNA) families among diverse plant species. It has been reported that miR319 regulates plant development in dicotyledons, but little is known at present about its functions in monocotyledons. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the MIR319 gene family comprises two members, Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b. Here, we report an expression pattern analysis and a functional characterization of the two Osa-MIR319 genes in rice. We found that overexpressing Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b in rice both resulted in wider leaf blades. Leaves of osa-miR319 overexpression transgenic plants showed an increased number of longitudinal small veins, which probably accounted for the increased leaf blade width. In addition, we observed that overexpressing osa-miR319 led to enhanced cold tolerance (4 °C) after chilling acclimation (12 °C) in transgenic rice seedlings. Notably, under both 4 and 12 °C low temperatures, Osa-MIR319a and Osa-MIR319b were down-regulated while the expression of miR319-targeted genes was induced. Furthermore, genetically down-regulating the expression of either of the two miR319-targeted genes, OsPCF5 and OsPCF8, in RNA interference (RNAi) plants also resulted in enhanced cold tolerance after chilling acclimation. Our findings in this study demonstrate that miR319 plays important roles in leaf morphogenesis and cold tolerance in rice.
23659345	Molecular modeling of protein-protein interaction to decipher the structural mechanism of nonhost resistance in rice.	2014	J Biomol Struct Dyn	Nonhost resistance (NHR) is the most common and durable form of plant resistance to disease-causing organisms. A successful example of NHR is the cloning of a maize R gene Rxo1 in rice and validating its function in conferring bacterial streak resistance in transgenic rice lines. In order to understand the structural mechanism of NHR in rice, we built the model of the protein-protein interaction between the encoded Rxo1 (RXO1) and AvrRXO1 (avirulence protein of rice pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola). Interestingly, although a RXO1 homolog in rice (RHR) is present, it does not interact with AvrRXO1 in nature. We have confirmed that the specificity of RXO1-AvrRXO1 interaction originates from the structured leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of RXO1, facilitating the recognition process, while the absence of such ordered LRR region makes RHR unfavorable to recognize AvrRXO1. We postulate that the RXO1-AvrRXO1 complex formation is a three step process where electrostatic interactions, shape complementarity and short-range interactions play an important role. The presence of the structural and physicochemical properties essential for the protein-protein recognition process empowers RXO1 to mediate NHR, which the host protein RHR lacks and consequently loses its specificity to bind with AvrRXO1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the understanding of NHR in rice from the structural perspective of protein-protein interaction.
23702306	Genes encoding 4-Cys antimicrobial peptides in wheat Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migush.: multimodular structural organization, instraspecific variability, distribution and role in defence.	2013	FEBS J	A novel family of antifungal peptides was discovered in the wheat Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migusch. Two members of the family, designated Tk-AMP-X1 and Tk-AMP-X2, were completely sequenced and shown to belong to the α-hairpinin structural family of plant peptides with a characteristic C1XXXC2-X(n)-C3XXXC4 motif. The peptides inhibit the spore germination of several fungal pathogens in vitro. cDNA and gene cloning disclosed unique structure of genes encoding Tk-AMP-X peptides. They code for precursor proteins of unusual multimodular structure, consisting of a signal peptide, several α-hairpinin (4-Cys) peptide domains with a characteristic cysteine pattern separated by linkers and a C-terminal prodomain. Three types of precursor proteins, with five, six or seven 4-Cys peptide modules, were found in wheat. Among the predicted family members, several peptides previously isolated from T. kiharae seeds were identified. Genes encoding Tk-AMP-X precursors have no introns in the protein-coding regions and are upregulated by fungal pathogens and abiotic stress, providing conclusive evidence for their role in stress response. A combined PCR-based and bioinformatics approach was used to search for related genes in the plant kingdom. Homologous genes differing in the number of peptide modules were discovered in phylogenetically-related Triticum and Aegilops species, including polyploid wheat genome donors. Association of the Tk-AMP-X genes with A, B/G or D genomes of hexaploid wheat was demonstrated. Furthermore, Tk-AMP-X-related sequences were shown to be widespread in the Poaceae family among economically important crops, such as barley, rice and maize.
23667703	Evolution of and horizontal gene transfer in the Endornavirus genus.	2013	PLoS One	The transfer of genetic information between unrelated species is referred to as horizontal gene transfer. Previous studies have demonstrated that both retroviral and non-retroviral sequences have been integrated into eukaryotic genomes. Recently, we identified many non-retroviral sequences in plant genomes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary origin and gene transfer of domains present in endornaviruses which are double-stranded RNA viruses. Using the available sequences for endornaviruses, we found that Bell pepper endornavirus-like sequences homologous to the glycosyltransferase 28 domain are present in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the glycosyltransferase 28 domain of Bell pepper endornavirus may have originated from bacteria. In addition, two domains of Oryza sativa endornavirus, a glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domain and a capsular polysaccharide synthesis protein, also exhibited high similarity to those of bacteria. We found evidence that at least four independent horizontal gene transfer events for the glycosyltransferase 28 domain have occurred among plants, fungi, and bacteria. The glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domains of two proteobacteria may have been horizontally transferred to the genome of Thalassiosira pseudonana. Our study is the first to show that three glycome-related viral genes in the genus Endornavirus have been acquired from marine bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.
23733066	Effect of salinity tolerant PDH45 transgenic rice on physicochemical properties, enzymatic activities and microbial communities of rhizosphere soils.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The effect of genetically modified (GM) plants on environment is now major concern worldwide. The plant roots of rhizosphere soil interact with variety of bacteria which could be influenced by the transgene in GM plants. The antibiotic resistance genes in GM plants may be transferred to soil microbes. In this study we have examined the effect of overexpression of salinity tolerant pea DNA helicase 45 (PDH45) gene on microbes and enzymatic activities in the rhizosphere soil of transgenic rice IR64 in presence and absence of salt stress in two different rhizospheric soils (New Delhi and Odisha, India). The diversity of the microbial community and soil enzymes viz., dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, urease and nitrate reductase was assessed. The results revealed that there was no significant effect of transgene expression on rhizosphere soil of the rice plants. The isolated bacteria were phenotyped both in absence and presence of salt and no significant changes were found in their phenotypic characters as well as in their population. Overall, the overexpression of PDH45 in rice did not cause detectable changes in the microbial population, soil enzymatic activities and functional diversity of the rhizosphere soil microbial community.
23656311	Ax21-triggered immunity plays a significant role in rice defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2013	Phytopathology	XA21, as a pattern recognition receptor in rice, senses the quorum-sensing (QS) signal molecule Ax21 secreted by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and mediates hypersensitive response-like immunity against the pathogen. However, for the infection of another pathovar, X. o. pv. oryzicola (Xoc), relatively weak defense responses are observed in XA21-containing rice cultivars. In the present study, we demonstrated that the Xoc Δax21 mutant caused more severe disease symptoms than the wild type in XA21 rice cv. IRBB21, but not in non-Xa21 rice cv. Taipei 309. The substance(s) secreted by the wild-type Xoc strain, but not those by the ax21 mutant triggered host immunity against Xoo PXO99 Δax21 in Xa21 rice. Immunoblot analysis corroborated that Xoc, like Xoo, synthesizes and secretes Ax21. Furthermore, the membrane fusion protein RaxA was demonstrated to be required, but the ATP-binding cassette transporter RaxB was dispensable for Ax21 secretion in Xoc. In addition, we demonstrated that Ax21 functions as a QS signal molecule that regulates biofilm formation in Xoc. However, Ax21 signaling is dispensable for bacterial motility, the production of extracellular polysaccharide and protease secretion in Xoc. Interestingly, the two-component system RaxR/H was involved in the regulation of bacterial motility and the regulation was likely independent on Ax21 signaling in Xoc. Taken together, the results indicated that Ax21 secreted by Xoc might induce plant immunity that plays a significant role in rice defense against the pathogen infection.
23755054	Nicotianamine synthase overexpression positively modulates iron homeostasis-related genes in high iron rice.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Nearly one-third of the world population, mostly women and children, suffer from iron malnutrition and its consequences, such as anemia or impaired mental development. Biofortification of rice, which is a staple crop for nearly half of the world's population, can significantly contribute in alleviating iron deficiency. NFP rice (transgenic rice expressing nicotianamine synthase, ferritin and phytase genes) has a more than six-fold increase in iron content in polished rice grains, resulting from the synergistic action of nicotianamine synthase (NAS) and ferritin transgenes. We investigated iron homeostasis in NFP plants by analyzing the expression of 28 endogenous rice genes known to be involved in the homeostasis of iron and other metals, in iron-deficient and iron-sufficient conditions. RNA was collected from different tissues (roots, flag leaves, grains) and at three developmental stages during grain filling. NFP plants showed increased sensitivity to iron-deficiency conditions and changes in the expression of endogenous genes involved in nicotianamine (NA) metabolism, in comparison to their non-transgenic siblings (NTS). Elevated transcript levels were detected in NFP plants for several iron transporters. In contrast, expression of OsYSL2, which encodes a member of yellow stripe like protein family, and a transporter of the NA-Fe(II) complex was reduced in NFP plants under low iron conditions, indicating that expression of OsYSL2 is regulated by the endogenous iron status. Expression of the transgenes did not significantly affect overall iron homeostasis in NFP plants, which establishes the engineered push-pull mechanism as a suitable strategy to increase rice endosperm iron content.
23634958	Phylogeny and a structural model of plant MHX transporters.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Arabidopsis thaliana MHX gene (AtMHX) encodes a Mg²⁺/H⁺ exchanger. Among non-plant proteins, AtMHX showed the highest similarity to mammalian Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX) transporters, which are part of the Ca²⁺/cation (CaCA) exchanger superfamily.

RESULTS: Sequences showing similarity to AtMHX were searched in the databases or sequenced from cDNA clones. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MHX family is limited to plants, and constitutes a sixth family within the CaCA superfamily. Some plants include, besides a full MHX gene, partial MHX-related sequences. More than one full MHX gene was currently identified only in Oryza sativa and Mimulus guttatus, but an EST for more than one MHX was identified only in M. guttatus. MHX genes are not present in the currently available chlorophyte genomes. The prevalence of upstream ORFs in MHX genes is much higher than in most plant genes, and can limit their expression. A structural model of the MHXs, based on the resolved structure of NCX1, implies that the MHXs include nine transmembrane segments. The MHXs and NCXs share 32 conserved residues, including a GXG motif implicated in the formation of a tight-turn in a reentrant-loop. Three residues differ between all MHX and NCX proteins. Altered mobility under reducing and non-reducing conditions suggests the presence of an intramolecular disulfide-bond in AtMHX.

CONCLUSIONS: The absence of MHX genes in non-plant genomes and in the currently available chlorophyte genomes, and the presence of an NCX in Chlamydomonas, are consistent with the suggestion that the MHXs evolved from the NCXs after the split of the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages of the plant kingdom. The MHXs underwent functional diploidization in most plant species. De novo duplication of MHX occurred in O. sativa before the split between the Indica and Japonica subspecies, and was apparently followed by translocation of one MHX paralog from chromosome 2 to chromosome 11 in Japonica. The structural analysis presented and the identification of elements that differ between the MHXs and the NCXs, or between the MHXs of specific plant groups, can contribute to clarification of the structural basis of the function and ion selectivity of MHX transporters.
23649259	Identification of rice β-glucosidase with high hydrolytic activity towards salicylic acid β-D-glucoside.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	β-Glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) split β-glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing end of glucosides and oligosaccharides to release β-D-glucose. One of the important functions of plant β-glucosidase is deglucosylation of inactive glucosides of phytohormones to regulate levels of active hormones. Tuberonic acid is a jasmonate-related compound that shows tuber-inducing activity in the potato. We have identified two enzymes, OsTAGG1 and OsTAGG2, that have hydrolytic activity towards tuberonic acid β-D-glucoside in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The expression of OsTAGG2 is upregulated by wounding and by methyl jasmonate, suggesting that this isozyme is involved in responses to biotic stresses and wounding, but the physiological substrate of OsTAGG2 remains ambiguous. In this study, we produced recombinant OsTAGG2 in Pichia pastoris (rOsTAGG2P), and investigated its substrate specificity in detail. From 1 L of culture medium, 2.1 mg of purified recombinant enzyme was obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Ni-chelating column chromatography. The specific activity of rOsTAGG2P (182 U/mg) was close to that of the native enzyme (171 U/mg), unlike recombinant OsTAGG2 produced in Escherichia coli, which had approximately 3-fold lower specific activity than the native enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature for rOsTAGG2P were pH 3.4 and 60 °C. After pH and heat treatments, the enzyme retained its original activity in a pH range of 3.4-9.8 and below 55 °C. Native OsTAGG2 and rOsTAGG2P showed 4.5-4.7-fold higher activities towards salicylic acid β-D-glucoside, an inactive storage-form of salicylic acid, than towards tuberonic acid β-D-glucoside (TAG), although OsTAGG2 was originally isolated from rice based on TAG-hydrolytic activity.
23700450	Glutathione S-transferase of brown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens) is essential for their adaptation to gramine-containing host plants.	2013	PLoS One	Plants have evolved complex processes to ward off attacks by insects. In parallel, insects have evolved mechanisms to thwart these plant defenses. To gain insight into mechanisms that mediate this arms race between plants and herbivorous insects, we investigated the interactions between gramine, a toxin synthesized by plants of the family Gramineae, and glutathione S transferase (GST), an enzyme found in insects that is known to detoxify xenobiotics. Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa), a hydrophytic plant, also produces gramine and that rice resistance to brown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens, BPHs) is highly associated with in planta gramine content. We also show that gramine is a toxicant that causes BPH mortality in vivo and that knockdown of BPH GST gene nlgst1-1 results in increased sensitivity to diets containing gramine. These results suggest that the knockdown of key detoxification genes in sap-sucking insects may provide an avenue for increasing their sensitivity to natural plant-associated defense mechanisms.
23659665	Cytotoxic monacolin analogs from Monascus purpureus-fermented rice.	2013	J Asian Nat Prod Res	Two new monacolin analogs, monacolins O (1) and P (2), along with three known analogs, have been isolated from the ethanolic extract of Monascus purpureus-fermented rice. Their structures and absolute configurations were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, especially 2D NMR and CD spectral analyses as well as chemical method. Both 1 and 2 were tested against five tumor cell lines, and compound 1 exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against A2780 and A549 cell lines, with IC50 values of 3.7 and 8.0 μM, respectively.
23686337	Change of shoot architecture during juvenile-to-adult phase transition in soybean.	2013	Planta	Juvenile-to-adult phase change is an indispensable event which guarantees a successful life cycle. Phase change has been studied in maize, Arabidopsis and rice, but is mostly unknown in other species. Soybean/Fabaceae plants undergo drastic changes of shoot architecture at the early vegetative stage including phyllotactic change and leaf type alteration from simple to compound. These characteristics make soybean/Fabaceae plants an interesting taxon for investigating vegetative phase change. Following the expansion of two cotyledons, two simple leaves simultaneously emerge in opposite phyllotaxy. The phyllotaxy of the third and fourth leaves is not fixed; both opposite and distichous phyllotaxis are observed within the same population. Leaves were compound from the third leaf. But the third leaf was rarely simple. Morphological and quantitative changes in early vegetative phase were recognized in leaf size, leaf shape, number of trichomes, stipule size and shape, and shoot meristem shape. Two microRNA genes, miR156 and miR172, are known to be associated with vegetative phase change. Examination of the expression level revealed that miR156 expression was high in the first two leaves and subsequently down-regulated, and that of miR172 showed the inverse expression pattern. These expression patterns coincided with the case of other species. Taken all data together, the first and second leaves represent juvenile phase, the fifth and upper leaves adult phase, and the third and fourth leaves intermediate stage. Further investigation of soybean phase change would give fruitful understandings on plant development.
23692054	Validation and characterization of Ghd7.1, a major quantitative trait locus with pleiotropic effects on spikelets per panicle, plant height, and heading date in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	A quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affects heading date (HD) and the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) was previously identified in a small region on chromosome 7 in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In order to further characterize the QTL region, near isogenic lines (NILs) were quickly obtained by self-crossing recombinant inbred line 189, which is heterozygous in the vicinity of the target region. The pleiotropic effects of QTL Ghd7.1 on plant height (PH), SPP, and HD, were validated using an NIL-F2 population. Ghd7.1 explained 50.2%, 45.3%, and 76.9% of phenotypic variation in PH, SPP, and HD, respectively. Ghd7.1 was precisely mapped to a 357-kb region on the basis of analysis of the progeny of the NIL-F2 population. Day-length treatment confirmed that Ghd7.1 is sensitive to photoperiod, with long days delaying heading up to 12.5 d. Identification of panicle initiation and development for the pair of NILs showed that Ghd7.1 elongated the photoperiod-sensitive phase more than 10 d, but did not change the basic vegetative phase and the reproductive growth phase. These findings indicated that Ghd7.1 regulates SPP by controlling the rate of panicle differentiation rather than the duration of panicle development.
23663326	Genome-wide identification, characterization and expression analysis of populus leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase genes.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) comprise the largest group within the receptor-like kinase (RLK) superfamily in plants. This gene family plays critical and diverse roles in plant growth, development and stress response. Although the LRR-RLK families in Arabidopsis and rice have been previously analyzed, no comprehensive studies have been performed on this gene family in tree species.

RESULTS: In this work, 379 LRR-RLK genes were retrieved from the Populus trichocarpa genome and further grouped into 14 subfamilies based on their structural and sequence similarities. Approximately 82% (312 out of 379) of the PtLRR-RLK genes are located in segmental duplication blocks indicating the role of duplication process in the expansion of this gene family. The conservation and variation in motif composition and intron/exon arrangement among PtLRR-RLK subfamilies were analyzed to provide additional support for their phylogenetic relationship and more importantly to indicate the potential divergence in their functions. Expression profiling of PtLRR-RLKs showed that they were differentially expressed in different organs and tissues and some PtLRR-RLKs were specifically expressed in meristem tissues, which indicated their potential involvement in tissue development and differentiation. For most AtLRR-RLKs with defined functions, Populus homologues exhibiting similar expression patterns could be identified, which might indicate the functional conservation during evolution. Among 12 types of environmental cues analyzed by the genome-wide microarray data, PtLRR-RLKs showed specific responses to shoot organogenesis, wounding, low ammonium feeding, hypoxia and seasonal dormancy, but not to drought, re-watering after drought, flooding, AlCl3 treatment and bacteria or fungi treatments.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive genomic analysis of the Populus LRR-RLK gene family. Segmental duplication contributes significantly to the expansion of this gene family. Populus and Arabidopsis LRR-RLK homologues not only share similar genetic structures but also exhibit comparable expression patterns which point to the possible functional conservation of these LRR-RLKs in two model systems. Transcriptome profiling provides the first insight into the functional divergence among PtLRR-RLK gene subfamilies and suggests that they might take important roles in growth and adaptation of tree species.
23674369	Insight into the 3D structure of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Mol Model	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (E.C. 2.7.7.27; AGPase) is a key regulatory enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of starch biosynthesis in higher plants. AGPase consists of pair of small (SS) and large (LS) subunits thereby constituting a heterotetrameric structure. No crystal structure of the native heterotetrameric enzyme is available for any species, thus limiting the complete understanding of structure-function relationships of this enzyme. In this study, an attempt was made to deduce the heterotetrameric assembly of AGPase in rice. Homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the LS and SS was performed using the Swiss Model Server, and the models were evaluated and docked using GRAMM-X to obtain the stable heterodimer orientation (LS as receptor and SS as ligand) and then the heterotetrameric orientation. The initial heterotetrameric orientation was further refined using the RosettaDock Server. MD simulation of the representative heterodimer/tetramer was performed using NAMD, which indicated that the tail-to-tail interaction of LS and SS was more stable than the head-to-head orientation, and the heterotetramer energy was also minimized to -767,011 kcal mol(-1). Subunit-subunit interaction studies were then carried out using the programs NACCESS and Dimplot. A total of 57 interface residues were listed in SS and 63 in LS. The residues plotted by Dimplot were similar to those listed by NACCESS. Multiple sequence alignment of the sequences of LS and SS from potato, maize and rice validated the interactions inferred in the study. RMSD of 1.093 Å was obtained on superimposition of the deduced heterotetramer on the template homo-tetramer (1YP2), showing the similarity between the two structures.
23663106	PpeTAC1 promotes the horizontal growth of branches in peach trees and is a member of a functionally conserved gene family found in diverse plants species.	2013	Plant J	Trees are capable of tremendous architectural plasticity, allowing them to maximize their light exposure under highly competitive environments. One key component of tree architecture is the branch angle, yet little is known about the molecular basis for the spatial patterning of branches in trees. Here, we report the identification of a candidate gene for the br mutation in Prunus persica (peach) associated with vertically oriented growth of branches, referred to as 'pillar' or 'broomy'. Ppa010082, annotated as hypothetical protein in the peach genome sequence, was identified as a candidate gene for br using a next generation sequence-based mapping approach. Sequence similarity searches identified rice TAC1 (tiller angle control 1) as a putative ortholog, and we thus named it PpeTAC1. In monocots, TAC1 is known to lead to less compact growth by increasing the tiller angle. In Arabidopsis, an attac1 mutant showed more vertical branch growth angles, suggesting that the gene functions universally to promote the horizontal growth of branches. TAC1 genes belong to a gene family (here named IGT for a shared conserved motif) found in all plant genomes, consisting of two clades: one containing TAC1-like genes; the other containing LAZY1, which contains an EAR motif, and promotes vertical shoot growth in Oryza sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis through influencing polar auxin transport. The data suggest that IGT genes are ancient, and play conserved roles in determining shoot growth angles in plants. Understanding how IGT genes modulate branch angles will provide insights into how different architectural growth habits evolved in terrestrial plants.
23711378	Development and preliminary application of a triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for evaluating predation on three planthoppers in a rice ecosystem.	2013	Mol Ecol Resour	A multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to simultaneously detect the DNA of three rice planthoppers, that is, Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) (white-backed planthopper), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (brown planthopper) and Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (small brown planthopper), in the gut of their predators. The sets of primers and ALLGlo probes were targeted to the regions of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) genes in nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The sensitivity, specificity and interference test for the multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay were analysed. The assay's detection limits were 100, 1000 and 100 copies for the white-backed planthopper, the brown planthopper and the small brown planthopper, respectively. The specificity tests showed no cross-reactivity with genomic DNA from 30 other dominant herbivores, saprophagous insects and predators from rice ecosystem for each planthopper species. The assay was used in a preliminary study of predation events on the three planthoppers by three major spiders viz., Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bösenberg et Strand), Ummeliata insecticeps (Bösenberg et Strand) and Tetragnatha maxillosa Thorell which each differ in their preferred microhabitat as well as their predatory habits in rice field, and the results showed their predation on each planthopper species could be well evaluated using this method. Therefore, the multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay provides a new tool to study the mechanisms of prey shifting and natural regulation of the three rice planthoppers by generalist predators in rice ecosystem.
23705659	Autotoxicity mechanism of Oryza sativa: transcriptome response in rice roots exposed to ferulic acid.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Autotoxicity plays an important role in regulating crop yield and quality. To help characterize the autotoxicity mechanism of rice, we performed a large-scale, transcriptomic analysis of the rice root response to ferulic acid, an autotoxin from rice straw.

RESULTS: Root growth rate was decreased and reactive oxygen species, calcium content and lipoxygenase activity were increased with increasing ferulic acid concentration in roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed more transcripts responsive to short ferulic-acid exposure (1- and 3-h treatments, 1,204 genes) than long exposure (24 h, 176 genes). Induced genes were involved in cell wall formation, chemical detoxification, secondary metabolism, signal transduction, and abiotic stress response. Genes associated with signaling and biosynthesis for ethylene and jasmonic acid were upregulated with ferulic acid. Ferulic acid upregulated ATP-binding cassette and amino acid/auxin permease transporters as well as genes encoding signaling components such as leucine-rich repeat VIII and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases VII protein kinases, APETALA2/ethylene response factor, WRKY, MYB and Zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of a transcriptome analysis suggest the molecular mechanisms of plants in response to FA, including toxicity, detoxicification and signaling machinery. FA may have a significant effect on inhibiting rice root elongation through modulating ET and JA hormone homeostasis. FA-induced gene expression of AAAP transporters may contribute to detoxicification of the autotoxin. Moreover, the WRKY and Myb TFs and LRR-VIII and SD-2b kinases might regulate downstream genes under FA stress but not general allelochemical stress. This comprehensive description of gene expression information could greatly facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms of autotoxicity in plants.
23750162	Iron biofortification of myanmar rice.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Iron (Fe) deficiency elevates human mortality rates, especially in developing countries. In Myanmar, the prevalence of Fe-deficient anemia in children and pregnant women are 75 and 71%, respectively. Myanmar people have one of the highest per capita rice consumption rates globally. Consequently, production of Fe-biofortified rice would likely contribute to solving the Fe-deficiency problem in this human population. To produce Fe-biofortified Myanmar rice by transgenic methods, we first analyzed callus induction and regeneration efficiencies in 15 varieties that are presently popular because of their high-yields or high-qualities. Callus formation and regeneration efficiency in each variety was strongly influenced by types of culture media containing a range of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid concentrations. The Paw San Yin variety, which has a high-Fe content in polished seeds, performed well in callus induction and regeneration trials. Thus, we transformed this variety using a gene expression cassette that enhanced Fe transport within rice plants through overexpression of the nicotianamine synthase gene HvNAS1, Fe flow to the endosperm through the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, and Fe accumulation in endosperm by the Fe storage protein gene SoyferH2. A line with a transgene insertion was successfully obtained. Enhanced expressions of the introduced genes OsYSL2, HvNAS1, and SoyferH2 occurred in immature T2 seeds. The transformants accumulated 3.4-fold higher Fe concentrations, and also 1.3-fold higher zinc concentrations in T2 polished seeds compared to levels in non-transgenic rice. This Fe-biofortified rice has the potential to reduce Fe-deficiency anemia in millions of Myanmar people without changing food habits and without introducing additional costs.
23700411	Risk factors for mosquito house entry in the Lao PDR.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Construction of the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project and flooding of a 450 km(2) area of mountain plateau in south-central Lao PDR resulted in the resettlement of 6,300 people to newly built homes. We examined whether new houses would have altered risk of house entry by mosquitoes compared with traditional homes built from poorer construction materials.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Surveys were carried out in the Nam Theun 2 resettlement area and a nearby traditional rice farming area in 2010. Mosquitoes were sampled in bedrooms using CDC light traps in 96 resettlement houses and 96 traditional houses and potential risk factors for mosquito house entry were recorded. Risk of mosquito house entry was more than twice as high in traditional bamboo houses compared with those newly constructed from wood (Putative Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vector incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.26, 95% CI 1.38-3.70, P = 0.001; Anopheline IRR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.30-4.23, P = 0.005). Anophelines were more common in homes with cattle compared against those without (IRR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.29-4.17, P = 0.005).Wood smoke from cooking fires located under the house or indoors was found to be protective against house entry by both groups of mosquito, compared with cooking in a separate room beside the house (Putative JE vector IRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.26-0.73, P = 0.002; Anopheline IRR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.51, P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Construction of modern wooden homes should help reduce human-mosquito contact in the Lao PDR. Reduced mosquito contact rates could lead to reduced transmission of diseases such as JE and malaria. Cattle ownership was associated with increased anopheline house entry, so zooprophylaxis for malaria control is not recommended in this area. Whilst wood smoke was protective against putative JE vector and anopheline house entry we do not recommend indoor cooking since smoke inhalation can enhance respiratory disease.
23649167	Kinetics and functional diversity among the five members of the NADP-malic enzyme family from Zea mays, a C4 species.	2013	Photosynth Res	NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) is involved in different metabolic pathways in several organisms due to the relevant physiological functions of the substrates and products of its reaction. In plants, it is one of the most important proteins that were recruited to fulfil key roles in C4 photosynthesis. Recent advances in genomics allowed the characterization of the complete set of NADP-ME genes from some C3 species, as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa; however, the characterization of the complete NADP-ME family from a C4 species has not been performed yet. In this study, while taking advantage of the complete Zea mays genome sequence recently released, the characterization of the whole NADP-ME family is presented. The maize NADP-ME family is composed of five genes, two encoding plastidic NADP-MEs (ZmC4- and ZmnonC4-NADP-ME), and three cytosolic enzymes (Zmcyt1-, Zmcyt2-, and Zmcyt3-NADP-ME). The results presented clearly show that each maize NADP-ME displays particular organ distribution, response to stress stimuli, and differential biochemical properties. Phylogenetic footprinting studies performed with the NADP-MEs from several grasses, indicate that four members of the maize NADP-ME family share conserved transcription factor binding motifs with their orthologs, indicating conserved physiological functions for these genes in monocots. Based on the results obtained in this study, and considering the biochemical plasticity shown by the NADP-ME, it is discussed the relevance of the presence of a multigene family, in which each member encodes an isoform with particular biochemical properties, in the evolution of the C4 NADP-ME, improved to fulfil the requirements for an efficient C4 mechanism.
23666184	Protein SUMOylation and plant abiotic stress signaling: in silico case study of rice RLKs, heat-shock and Ca(2+)-binding proteins.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	Plants respond to stress conditions through early stress-response factors (ESRF), which serve the function of stress sensing and/or signal transduction. These mainly comprise qualitative and/or quantitative flux in the redox molecules, calcium ions (Ca(2+)), phosphatidic acid, hexose sugars and phytohormones. The role of resident proteins such as phytohormone receptors and G-proteins as first messengers under stress is well established. Yet, within the modern omics context, most of the stress response at the protein level is injudiciously attributed to substantial up- or down-regulation of expression measured at the RNA or protein level. Proteins such as kinases and transcription factors (TFs) that exhibit cascade effects are primary candidates for studies in plant stress tolerance. However, resident-protein post-translational modification (PTM), specifically in response to particular conditions such as stress, is a candidate for immediate and potent 'quick reaction force' (QRF) kind of effects. Stress-mediated SUMOylation of TFs and other proteins have been observed. SUMOylation can change the rate of activity, function or location of the modified protein. Early SUMOylation of resident proteins can act in the stress signal transduction or in adaptive response. Here, we consider brief background information on ESRFs to establish the crosstalk between these factors that impinge on PTMs. We then illustrate connections of protein SUMOylation to phytohormones and TFs. Finally, we present results of an in silico analysis of rice Receptor-Like Kinases, heat-shock and calcium-binding proteins to identify members of these gene families, whose basal expression under drought but potential SUMOylation presents them as QRF candidates for roles in stress signaling/response.
23774221	Microwave pyrolysis of rice straw: products, mechanism, and kinetics.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Rice straw is an abundant resource for the production of biofuels and bio-based products. How to convert the recalcitrant lignocellulose effectually is a critical issue. The objective of this study was to investigate the products, mechanism, and kinetics of rice straw pyrolysis by using microwave heating. The highest energy densification ratio of solid residues was achieved at the microwave power level of 300 W. The atomic H/C and O/C ratios of solid residues were much lower than those of rice straw. The primary components of gaseous product were CO, H2, CO2, and CH4, whose molecular fractions were 57%, 21%, 14%, and 8%, respectively. The more gaseous product and the less solid residues were obtained at higher microwave power levels, while the liquid production remained the same and showed a maximum of about 50 wt.%. The kinetic parameters of rice straw pyrolysis were increased with increasing microwave power level.
23660284	dbWFA: a web-based database for functional annotation of Triticum aestivum transcripts.	2013	Database (Oxford)	The functional annotation of genes based on sequence homology with genes from model species genomes is time-consuming because it is necessary to mine several unrelated databases. The aim of the present work was to develop a functional annotation database for common wheat Triticum aestivum (L.). The database, named dbWFA, is based on the reference NCBI UniGene set, an expressed gene catalogue built by expressed sequence tag clustering, and on full-length coding sequences retrieved from the TriFLDB database. Information from good-quality heterogeneous sources, including annotations for model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and Oryza sativa L., was gathered and linked to T. aestivum sequences through BLAST-based homology searches. Even though the complexity of the transcriptome cannot yet be fully appreciated, we developed a tool to easily and promptly obtain information from multiple functional annotation systems (Gene Ontology, MapMan bin codes, MIPS Functional Categories, PlantCyc pathway reactions and TAIR gene families). The use of dbWFA is illustrated here with several query examples. We were able to assign a putative function to 45% of the UniGenes and 81% of the full-length coding sequences from TriFLDB. Moreover, comparison of the annotation of the whole T. aestivum UniGene set along with curated annotations of the two model species assessed the accuracy of the annotation provided by dbWFA. To further illustrate the use of dbWFA, genes specifically expressed during the early cell division or late storage polymer accumulation phases of T. aestivum grain development were identified using a clustering analysis and then annotated using dbWFA. The annotation of these two sets of genes was consistent with previous analyses of T. aestivum grain transcriptomes and proteomes. Database URL: urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dbWFA/
23718125	The rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae produces 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid via XanB2 for use in xanthomonadin, ubiquinone, and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of rice bacterial blight, produces membrane-bound yellow pigments, referred to as xanthomonadins. Xanthomonadins protect the pathogen from photodamage and host-induced perioxidation damage. They are also required for epiphytic survival and successful host plant infection. Here, we show that XanB2 encoded by PXO_3739 plays a key role in xanthomonadin and coenzyme Q8 biosynthesis in X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A. A xanB2 deletion mutant exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype, including xanthomonadin deficiency, producing less exopolysaccharide (EPS), lower viability and H2O2 resistance, and lower virulence. We further demonstrate that X. oryzae pv. oryzae produces 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) via XanB2. 3-HBA is associated with xanthomonadin biosynthesis while 4-HBA is mainly used as a precursor for coenzyme Q (CoQ)8 biosynthesis. XanB2 is the alternative source of 4-HBA for CoQ8 biosynthesis in PXO99A. These findings suggest that the roles of XanB2 in PXO99A are generally consistent with those in X. campestris pv. campestris. The present study also demonstrated that X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A has evolved several specific features in 3-HBA and 4-HBA signaling. First, our results showed that PXO99A produces less 3-HBA and 4-HBA than X. campestris pv. campestris and this is partially due to a degenerated 4-HBA efflux pump. Second, PXO99A has evolved unique xanthomonadin induction patterns via 3-HBA and 4-HBA. Third, our results showed that 3-HBA or 4-HBA positively regulates the expression of gum cluster to promote EPS production in PXO99A. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that XanB2 is a key metabolic enzyme linking xanthomonadin, CoQ, and EPS biosynthesis, which are collectively essential for X. oryzae pv. oryzae pathogenesis.
23733064	Interactions among rice ORC subunits.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The origin recognition complex (ORC) is composed of six subunits and plays an important role in DNA replication in all eukaryotes. The ORC subunits OsORC6 as well as the other five ORC subunits in rice were experimentally isolated and sequenced. It indicated that there also exist six ORC subunits in rice. Results of RT-PCR indicated that expression of all the rice ORC genes are no significant difference under 26°C and 34°C. Yeast two hybridization indicated that OsORC2, -3, -5 interact with each other. OsORC5 can then bind OsORC4 to form the OsORC2, -3,-4,-5 core complex. It suggested that the basic interactions have been conserved through evolution. No binding of OsORC1 and OsORC6 with the other subunits were observed. A model of ORC complex in rice is proposed.
23656867	Ospapst1, a useful mutant for identifying seed purity and authenticity in hybrid rice.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The stability and completeness of male sterility is still a challenge in some male sterile rice lines, especially those of photoperiod/thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (P/TGMS). Leaf color marker is a widely practiced approach to reduce the impact of self-pollinated seeds of male sterile lines. The papst1 is a leaf color mutant. The newly emerged leaves of papst1 are chlorosis and have an impaired photosynthesis. But the other agronomic traits, such as germination rate, duration of maturation and seed weight, are not changed. The papst1/PAPST1 F₁ showed the wild-type leaf phenotype. The papst1/PAPST1 F₂ progenies displayed an approximately 3:1 segregation ratio of WT phenotype:mutant phenotype (72: 28, χ(2) = 0.48, p > 0.05), suggesting that papst1 mutant phenotype is caused by a single repressive gene. Map-based cloning and sequencing analysis revealed that a point mutation was occurred in Os01 g16040 (OsPAPST1). Given these results, the Ospapst1 mutant is a useful mutant for identifying seed purity and authenticity in hybrid rice.
23675379	Iron-biofortification in rice by the introduction of three barley genes participated in mugineic acid biosynthesis with soybean ferritin gene.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Iron deficiency is a serious problem around the world, especially in developing countries. The production of iron-biofortified rice will help ameliorate this problem. Previously, expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin, in rice using an endosperm-specific promoter resulted in a two-fold increase in iron concentration in the resultant transgenic seeds. However, further over expression of ferritin did not produce an additional increase in the seed iron concentration, and symptoms of iron deficiency were noted in the leaves of the transgenic plants. In the present study, we aimed to further increase the iron concentration in rice seeds without increasing the sensitivity to iron deficiency by enhancing the uptake and transport of iron via a ferric iron chelator, mugineic acid. To this end, we introduced the soybean ferritin gene (SoyferH2) driven by two endosperm-specific promoters, along with the barley nicotianamine synthase gene (HvNAS1), two nicotianamine aminotransferase genes (HvNAAT-A and -B), and a mugineic acid synthase gene (IDS3) to enhance mugineic acid production in rice plants. A marker-free vector was utilized as a means of increasing public acceptance. Representative lines were selected from 102 transformants based on the iron concentration in polished seeds and ferritin accumulation in the seeds. These lines were grown in both commercially supplied soil (iron-sufficient conditions) and calcareous soil (iron-deficient conditions). Lines expressing both ferritin and mugineic acid biosynthetic genes showed signs of iron-deficiency tolerance in calcareous soil. The iron concentration in polished T3 seeds was increased by 4 and 2.5 times, as compared to that in non-transgenic lines grown in normal and calcareous soil, respectively. These results indicate that the concomitant introduction of the ferritin gene and mugineic acid biosynthetic genes effectively increased the seed iron level without causing iron sensitivity under iron-limited conditions.
23705930	Phylogeny, structural evolution and functional diversification of the plant PHOSPHATE1 gene family: a focus on Glycine max.	2013	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) gene family members have diverse roles in plant growth and development, and they have been studied in Arabidopsis, rice, and Physcomitrella. However, it has yet to be described in other plants. Therefore, we surveyed the evolutionary patterns of genomes within the plant PHO1 gene family, focusing on soybean (Glycine max) due to its economic importance.

RESULTS: Our data show that PHO1 genes could be classified into two major groups (Class I and Class II). Class I genes were only present and expanded in dicotyledonous plants and Selaginella moellendorffii; Class II genes were found in all land plants. Class I sequence losses in other lineages may be attributed to gene loss after duplication events in land plant evolution. Introns varied from 7 to 14, and ancestral state reconstruction analyses revealed that genes with 13 introns were ancestral, thus suggesting that the intron loss was a chief constituent of PHO1 gene evolution. In the soybean genome, only 12 PHO1-like genes (GmaPHO1) were detected at the mRNA level. These genes display tissue-specific or tissue-preferential expression patterns during soybean plant and fruit development. Class I genes were more broadly expressed than Class II. GmaPHO1 genes had altered expression in response to salt, osmotic, and inorganic phosphate stresses.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that PHO1 genes originated from a eukaryotic ancestor and that two major classes formed in land plants. Class I genes are only present in dicots and lycophytes. GmaPHO1genes had diverse expression patterns in soybean, indicating their dramatic functional diversification.
23668360	Natural variation in Early flowering1 contributes to early flowering in japonica rice under long days.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Natural variation in heading-date genes enables rice, a short-day (SD) plant, to flower early under long-day (LD) conditions at high latitudes. Through analysis of heading-date quantitative trait loci (QTL) with F7 recombinant inbred lines from the cross of early heading 'H143' and late heading 'Milyang23 (M23)', we found a minor-effect Early Heading3 (EH3) QTL in the Hd16 region on chromosome 3. We found that Early flowering1 (EL1), encoding casein kinase I (CKI), is likely to be responsible for the EH3/Hd16 QTL, because a missense mutation occurred in the highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of EL1 in H143. A different missense mutation was found in the EL1 kinase domain in Koshihikari. In vitro kinase assays revealed that EL1/CKI in H143 and Koshihikari are non-functional. In F7:9 heterogeneous inbred family-near isogenic lines (HNILs), HNIL(H143) flowered 13 days earlier than HNIL(M23) in LD, but not in SD, in which EL1 mainly acts as a LD-dependent flowering repressor, down-regulating Ehd1 expression. In the world rice collection, two types of non-functional EL1 variants were found in japonica rice generally cultivated at high latitudes. These results indicate that natural variation in EL1 contributes to early heading for rice adaptation to LD in temperate and cooler regions.
23702596	A novel integrated method for large-scale detection, identification, and quantification of widely targeted metabolites: application in the study of rice metabolomics.	2013	Mol Plant	Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics has been facilitated by the construction of MS(2) spectral tag (MS2T) library from the total scan ESI MS/MS data, and the development of widely targeted metabolomics method using MS/MS data gathered from authentic standards. In this report, a novel strategy called stepwise multiple ion monitoring-enhanced product ions (stepwise MIM-EPI) was developed to construct the MS2T library, in which stepwise MIM was used as survey scans to trigger the acquisition of EPI. A total number of 698 (almost) non-redundant metabolites with MS(2) spectra were obtained, of which 135 metabolites were identified/annotated. Integrating the data gathered from our MS2T library and other available multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) information, a widely targeted metabolomics method was developed to quantify 277 metabolites, including some phytohormones. Evaluation of the dehydration responses and natural variations of these metabolites in rice leaf not only suggested the coordinated regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) with metabolites such as serotonin derivative(s), polyamine conjugates under drought stress, but also revealed some C-glycosylated flavones as the potential markers for the discrimination of indica and japonica rice subspecies. The new MS2T library construction and widely targeted metabolomics strategy could be used as a tool for rice functional genomics.
23649262	Studies targeting α-glucosidase inhibition, antiangiogenic effects, and lipid modification regulation: background, evaluation, and challenges in the development of food ingredients for therapeutic purposes.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Since the discovery of α-glucosidase inhibitors and their inhibitory effects on the digestion of carbohydrates, promising results have been obtained as to the antidiabetic effects of this family of compounds. Antiangiogenic compounds have been identified that suppress tumor growth via a unique mechanism, confirming that such compounds can act as clinically applicable anticancer agents. Lipid peroxidation and lipid glycation have been suggested to play roles in food deterioration and in the pathophysiology of human diseases such as atherogenesis and diabetes, and antioxidative and antiglycative compounds can potentially be used in the prevention of food deterioration as well as to treat disease. On this basis, this review describes studies of α-glucosidase inhibition by mulberry 1-deoxynojirimycin, antiangiogenic effects of rice bran tocotrienol, and membrane lipid peroxidation/glycation and its inhibitors. These studies are ongoing in our work, with an emphasis on analytical techniques.
23680125	Enantioselective hydrolyzation and photolyzation of dufulin in water.	2013	Chem Cent J	BACKGROUND: Dufulin is a novel, highly effective antiviral agent that activatives systemic acquired resistance of plants. This compound is widely used in China to prevent and control viral diseases in tobacco, vegetable and rice. Dufulin can treat plants infected by the tobacco mosaic virus and the cucumber mosaic virus. However, the achiral analysis and residue determination of dufulin remain underdeveloped because of its high enantioselectivity rates and high control costs. The enantioselectivity of an antiviral compound is an important factor that should be considered when studying the effect of chiral pesticides on the environment. The enantioselective degradation of dufulin in water remains an important objective in pesticide science.

RESULTS: The configuration of dufulin enantiomers was determined in this study based on its circular dichroism spectra. The S-(+)-dufulin and R-(-)-dufulin enantiomers were separated and identified using an amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral column by normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The degradation of the rac-dufulin racemate and its separate enantiomers complied with first-order reaction kinetics and demonstrated acceptable linearity. The enantioselective photolysis of rac-dufulin allowed for the faster degradation of R-(-)-dufulin, as compared with S-(+)-dufulin. However, S-(+)-dufulin was hydrolyzed faster than its antipode.

CONCLUSION: The photolysation and hydrolyzation of dufulin in water samples normally complied with the first-order kinetics and demonstrated acceptable linearity (R2>0.66). A preferential photolysation of the R-(-)-enantiomer was observed in water samples. Moreover, the S-(+)-enantiomer was hydrolyzed faster than its antipode.
23675376	Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Legume Vicia faba.	2013	Front Plant Sci	The number of plant mitochondrial genomes sequenced exceeds two dozen. However, for a detailed comparative study of different phylogenetic branches more plant mitochondrial genomes should be sequenced. This article presents sequencing data and comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the legume Vicia faba. The size of the V. faba circular mitochondrial master chromosome of cultivar Broad Windsor was estimated as 588,000 bp with a genome complexity of 387,745 bp and 52 conservative mitochondrial genes; 32 of them encoding proteins, 3 rRNA, and 17 tRNA genes. Six tRNA genes were highly homologous to chloroplast genome sequences. In addition to the 52 conservative genes, 114 unique open reading frames (ORFs) were found, 36 without significant homology to any known proteins and 29 with homology to the Medicago truncatula nuclear genome and to other plant mitochondrial ORFs, 49 ORFs were not homologous to M. truncatula but possessed sequences with significant homology to other plant mitochondrial or nuclear ORFs. In general, the unique ORFs revealed very low homology to known closely related legumes, but several sequence homologies were found between V. faba, Beta vulgaris, Nicotiana tabacum, Vitis vinifera, and even the monocots Oryza sativa and Zea mays. Most likely these ORFs arose independently during angiosperm evolution (Kubo and Mikami, 2007; Kubo and Newton, 2008). Computational analysis revealed in total about 45% of V. faba mtDNA sequence being homologous to the Medicago truncatula nuclear genome (more than to any sequenced plant mitochondrial genome), and 35% of this homology ranging from a few dozen to 12,806 bp are located on chromosome 1. Apparently, mitochondrial rrn5, rrn18, rps10, ATP synthase subunit alpha, cox2, and tRNA sequences are part of transcribed nuclear mosaic ORFs.
23666066	Zhang-Rice physics and anomalous copper states in A-site ordered perovskites.	2013	Sci Rep	In low dimensional cuprates several interesting phenomena, including high Tc superconductivity, are deeply connected to electron correlations on Cu and the presence of the Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet state. Here, we report on direct spectroscopic observation of the ZR state responsible for the low-energy physical properties in two isostructural A-site ordered cuprate perovskites, CaCu(3)Co(4)O(12) and CaCu(3)Cr(4)O(12) as revealed by resonant soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy on the Cu L(3,2)- and O K-edges. These measurements reveal the signature of Cu in the high-energy 3+ (3d(8)), the typical 2+ (3d(9)), as well as features of the ZR singlet state (i.e., 3d(9)L, L denotes an oxygen hole). First principles GGA + U calculations affirm that the B-site cation controls the degree of Cu-O hybridization and, thus, the Cu valency. These findings introduce another avenue for the study and manipulation of cuprates, bypassing the complexities inherent to conventional chemical doping (i.e. disorder) that hinder the relevant physics.
23733074	The copy number of rice CACTA DNA transposons carrying MIR820 does not correlate with MIR820 expression.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	MiR820 is a small RNA species (22 and 24 nucleotides), produced from transcripts originated from a region inside CACTA DNA transposons in rice. Because MIR820 is a transposon gene, its expression may depend on the transposon copy number. Here, we investigated the copy number of MIR820 and its expression levels in various cultivars and wild species of rice. We found no correlation between copy number and expression level, suggesting that MIR820 transcription is regulated not by the copy dosage but by the epigenetic state of each copy.
23644036	Human serum albumin from recombinant DNA technology: challenges and strategies.	2013	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: As the most abundant protein in the blood, human serum albumin (HSA) plays an important role in maintaining plasma oncotic pressure and fluid balance between the body's compartments. HSA is thus widely used in the clinic to treat diseases. However, the shortage of and safety issues arising from using plasma HSA (pHSA) underscore the importance of recombinant HSA (rHSA) as a promising substitute for pHSA.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here, we review the production of rHSA, from expression to downstream processing, and highlight the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the two main expression platforms. We also discuss the biosafety of commercially available pharmaceutical rHSA with respect to impurities and contaminants, followed by an analysis of recent progress in preclinical and clinical trials. We emphasise the challenges of producing pharmaceutical-grade rHSA.

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: rHSA can be highly expressed in various hosts and seems to be identical to pHSA. rHSA generated from yeast appears to be as efficient and safe as pHSA in a series of preclinical and clinical trials, whereas rHSA from rice seeds exhibits great potential for more cost-effective production. Cost-effective products with no adverse effects will likely play a vital role in future human therapeutics.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our understanding of pharmaceutical-grade rHSA production has improved with respect to expression hosts, biochemical properties, downstream processing, and the detection and removal of impurities. However, due to the large dosages required for clinical applications, the production of sufficient quantities of rHSA still presents challenges. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Serum Albumin.
23720666	MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) triggered immunity in plants.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Plants are sessile organisms that are under constant attack from microbes. They rely on both preformed defenses, and their innate immune system to ward of the microbial pathogens. Preformed defences include for example the cell wall and cuticle, which act as physical barriers to microbial colonization. The plant immune system is composed of surveillance systems that perceive several general microbe elicitors, which allow plants to switch from growth and development into a defense mode, rejecting most potentially harmful microbes. The elicitors are essential structures for pathogen survival and are conserved among pathogens. The conserved microbe-specific molecules, referred to as microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs), are recognized by the plant innate immune systems pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). General elicitors like flagellin (Flg), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Ax21 (Activator of XA21-mediated immunity in rice), fungal chitin, and β-glucans from oomycetes are recognized by plant surface localized PRRs. Several of the MAMPs and their corresponding PRRs have, in recent years, been identified. This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding important MAMPs from bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, their structure, the plant PRRs that recognizes them, and how they induce MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) in plants.
23735799	Optimized simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of rice straw for ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Scheffersomyces stipitis co-culture using design of experiments.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Herein an ethanol production process from rice straw was optimized. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Scheffersomyces stipitis co-culture was carried out to enhance ethanol production. The optimal saccharification solid loading was 5%. Key fermentation parameters for co-culture including cell ratio, agitation rate and temperature was rationally optimized using design of experiment (DoE). Optimized co-culture conditions for maximum ethanol production efficiency were at S. cerevisiae:S. stipitis cell ratio of 0.31, agitation rate of 116 rpm and temperature of 33.1°C. The optimized SSCF process reached ethanol titer of 15.2g/L and ethanol yield of 99% of theoretical yield, consistent with the DoE model prediction. Moreover, SSCF process under high biomass concentration resulted in high ethanol concentration of 28.6g/L. This work suggests the efficiency and scalability of the developed SSCF process which could provide an important basis for the economic feasibility of ethanol production from lignocelluloses.
23653313	Quantification of rice blast disease progressions through Taqman real-time PCR.	2013	Mol Biotechnol	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is a major disease in the paddy field and also a representative model system in the investigation of plant-microbe interactions. This study was undertaken to provide the quantitative evaluation method that specifically determines the amount of M. oryzae proliferation in planta. Real-time PCR was used as the detection strategy in combination with the primer pair and Taqman probe specific to MHP1, a unigene encoding HYDROPHOBIN that is indispensable for normal virulence expression. Based on the crossing point values from the PCR reactions containing a series of increasing concentration of cloned amplicon or fungal genomic DNA, correlation among the template's copy number or its amount and amplification pattern was calculated. Reliability of this equation was further confirmed using the DNA samples from the rice leaves infected with compatible or incompatible strains of M. oryzae. The primer pair used in the Taqman real-time PCR reaction can recognize the existence of fungal DNA as low as 1 pg. In sum, our quantitative evaluation system is applicable and reliable in the blast diagnosis and also in the estimation of objective blast disease progression.
23648859	Exopolysaccharide produced by Pediococcus acidilactici M76 isolated from the Korean traditional rice wine, makgeolli.	2013	J Microbiol Biotechnol	This work is aimed to increase knowledge of the functional exopolysaccharide (EPS) from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in makgeolli, a Korean fermented rice wine. Among LAB strains isolated from makgeolli, strain M76 was selected as a functional strain producing a bioactive EPS, based on its antioxidative activity on the DPPH radical. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis showed a high sequence similarity (99.0%) with P. acidilactici, but had different biochemical properties with the already known P. acidilactici type strains in the aspect of carbohydrates utilization. The obtained P. acidilactici M76 produced a soluble EPS above 2 g/l. One-step chromatography using gel filtration after ethanol precipitation from the supernatant of P. acidilactici M76 was enough to obtain purified EPS with a single peak, showing a molecular mass of approximately 67 kDa. Componential and structural analyses of EPS by TLC, HPLC, and FT-IR indicated that the EPS is a glucan, consisting of glucose units. The purified EPS had antioxidant activity on the DPPH radical of 45.8% at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The purified EPS also showed proliferative effect on the pancreatic RIN-m5F cell line and remarkable protection activity on alloxan-induced cytotoxicity. This potent antioxidant and antidiabetic EPS by LAB in makgeolli may contribute to understanding the functionality of makgeolli.
23734193	Comparative transcriptome profiling reveals different expression patterns in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains with putative virulence-relevant genes.	2013	PLoS One	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the causal agent of rice bacterial blight, which is a major rice disease in tropical Asian countries. An attempt has been made to investigate gene expression patterns of three Xoo strains on the minimal medium XOM2, PXO99 (P6) and PXO86 (P2) from the Philippines, and GD1358 (C5) from China, which exhibited different virulence in 30 rice varieties, with putative virulence factors using deep sequencing. In total, 4,781 transcripts were identified in this study, and 1,151 and 3,076 genes were differentially expressed when P6 was compared with P2 and with C5, respectively. Our results indicated that Xoo strains from different regions exhibited distinctly different expression patterns of putative virulence-relevant genes. Interestingly, 40 and 44 genes involved in chemotaxis and motility exhibited higher transcript alterations in C5 compared with P6 and P2, respectively. Most other genes associated with virulence, including exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, Hrp genes and type III effectors, including Xanthomonas outer protein (Xop) effectors and transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors, were down-regulated in C5 compared with P6 and P2. The data were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, tests of bacterial motility, and enzyme activity analysis of EPS and xylanase. These results highlight the complexity of Xoo and offer new avenues for improving our understanding of Xoo-rice interactions and the evolution of Xoo virulence.
22276194	Environmental factors affecting the expression of pilAB as well as the proteome and transcriptome of the grass endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Bacterial communication is involved in regulation of cellular mechanisms such as metabolic processes, microbe-host interactions or biofilm formation. In the nitrogen-fixing model endophyte of grasses Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, known cell-cell signaling systems have not been identified; however, the pilA gene encoding the structural protein of type IV pili that are essential for plant colonization appears to be regulated in a population density-dependent manner.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our data suggest that pilAB expression is affected by population density, independent of autoinducers typical for gram-negative bacteria, likely depending on unknown secreted molecule(s) that can be produced by different bacterial species. We used transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to identify target genes and proteins differentially regulated in conditioned supernatants in comparison to standard growth conditions. Around 8% of the 3992 protein-coding genes of Azoarcus sp. and 18% of the detected proteins were differentially regulated. Regulatory proteins and transcription factors among the regulated proteins indicated a complex hierarchy. Differentially regulated genes and proteins were involved in processes such as type IV pili formation and regulation, metal and nutrient transport, energy metabolism, and unknown functions mediated by hypothetical proteins. Four of the newly discovered target genes were further analyzed and in general they showed regulation patterns similar to pilAB. The expression of one of them was shown to be induced in plant roots.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first global approach to initiate characterization of cell density-dependent gene regulation mediated by soluble molecule(s) in the model endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72. Our data suggest that the putative signaling molecule(s) are also produced by other Proteobacteria and might thus be used for interspecies communication. This study provides the foundation for the development of robust reporter systems for Azoarcus sp. to analyze mechanisms and molecules involved in the population-dependent gene expression in this endophyte in future.
22295065	TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, reactive oxygen species, potassium efflux activates NLRP3/ASC inflammasome during respiratory syncytial virus infection.	2012	PLoS One	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitute highly pathogenic virus that cause severe respiratory diseases in newborn, children, elderly and immuno-compromised individuals. Airway inflammation is a critical regulator of disease outcome in RSV infected hosts. Although "controlled" inflammation is required for virus clearance, aberrant and exaggerated inflammation during RSV infection results in development of inflammatory diseases like pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays an important role in inflammation by orchestrating the pro-inflammatory response. IL-1β is synthesized as an immature pro-IL-1β form. It is cleaved by activated caspase-1 to yield mature IL-1β that is secreted extracellularly. Activation of caspase-1 is mediated by a multi-protein complex known as the inflammasome. Although RSV infection results in IL-1β release, the mechanism is unknown. Here in, we have characterized the mechanism of IL-1β secretion following RSV infection. Our study revealed that NLRP3/ASC inflammasome activation is crucial for IL-1β production during RSV infection. Further studies illustrated that prior to inflammasome formation; the "first signal" constitutes activation of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2)/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling is required for pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 gene expression during RSV infection. Following expression of these genes, two "second signals" are essential for triggering inflammasome activation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potassium (K(+)) efflux due to stimulation of ATP-sensitive ion channel promote inflammasome activation following RSV infection. Thus, our studies have underscored the requirement of TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway (first signal) and ROS/potassium efflux (second signal) for NLRP3/ASC inflammasome formation, leading to caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1β release during RSV infection.
22808269	Respiratory syncytial virus assembles into structured filamentous virion particles independently of host cytoskeleton and related proteins.	2012	PLoS One	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that assembles into viral filaments at the cell surface. Virus assembly often depends on the ability of a virus to use host proteins to accomplish viral tasks. Since the fusion protein cytoplasmic tail (FCT) is critical for viral filamentous assembly, we hypothesized that host proteins important for viral assembly may be recruited by the FCT. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that filamin A interacted with FCT, and mammalian cell experiments showed it localized to viral filaments but did not affect viral replication. Furthermore, we found that a number of actin-associated proteins also were excluded from viral filaments. Actin or tubulin cytoskeletal rearrangement was not necessary for F trafficking to the cell surface or for viral assembly into filaments, but was necessary for optimal viral replication and may be important for anchoring viral filaments. These findings suggest that RSV assembly into filaments occurs independently of actin polymerization and that viral proteins are the principal drivers for the mechanical tasks involved with formation of complex, structured RSV filaments at the host cell plasma membrane.
22412984	Differential expression of cytokines in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection of calves with high or low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.	2012	PLoS One	Deficiency of serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) has been related to increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of low respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. The neonatal calf model of RSV infection shares many features in common with RSV infection in infants and children. In the present study, we hypothesized that calves with low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) would be more susceptible to RSV infection than calves with high circulating levels of 25(OH)D(3). Calves were fed milk replacer diets with different levels of vitamin D for a 10 wk period to establish two treatment groups, one with high (177 ng/ml) and one with low (32.5 ng/ml) circulating 25(OH)D(3). Animals were experimentally infected via aerosol challenge with RSV. Data on circulating 25(OH)D(3) levels showed that high and low concentrations of 25(OH)D(3) were maintained during infection. At necropsy, lung lesions due to RSV were similar in the two vitamin D treatment groups. We show for the first time that RSV infection activates the vitamin D intracrine pathway in the inflamed lung. Importantly, however, we observed that cytokines frequently inhibited by this pathway in vitro are, in fact, either significantly upregulated (IL-12p40) or unaffected (IFN-γ) in the lungs of RSV-infected calves with high circulating levels of 25(OH)D(3). Our data indicate that while vitamin D does have an immunomodulatory role during RSV infection, there was no significant impact on pathogenesis during the early phases of RSV infection. Further examination of the potential effects of vitamin D status on RSV disease resolution will require longer-term studies with immunologically sufficient and deficient vitamin D levels.
22479589	Effects of chronic calorie restriction or dietary resveratrol supplementation on insulin sensitivity markers in a primate, Microcebus murinus.	2012	PLoS One	The prevalence of diabetes and hyperinsulinemia increases with age, inducing metabolic failure and limiting lifespan. Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition delays the aging process, but its long-term application to humans seems difficult. Resveratrol (RSV), a dietary polyphenol, appears to be a promising CR mimetic that can be easily administered in humans. In this work, we hypothesized that both CR and RSV impact insulin sensitivity in a non-human primate compared to standard-fed control (CTL) animals. Four- to five-year-old male grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) were assigned to three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30% fewer calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200 mg·day(-1)·kg(-1)). Insulin sensitivity and glycemia were assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) evaluation after 21 or 33 months of chronic treatment. Resting metabolic rate was also measured to assess the potential relationships between this energy expenditure parameter and insulin sensitivity markers. No differences were found after a 21-month period of treatment, except for lower glucose levels 30 min after glucose loading in CR animals. After 33 months, CR and RSV decreased glycemia after the oral glucose loading without decreasing fasting blood insulin. A general effect of treatment was observed on the HOMA-IR index, with an 81% reduction in CR animals and 53% in RSV animals after 33 months of treatment compared to CTL. Chronic CR and dietary supplementation with RSV affected insulin sensitivity by improving the glucose tolerance of animals without disturbing their baseline insulin secretion. These results suggest that both CR and RSV have beneficial effects on metabolic alterations, although these effects are different in amplitude between the two anti-aging treatments and potentially rely on different metabolic changes.
22272270	MicroRNA-221 modulates RSV replication in human bronchial epithelium by targeting NGF expression.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Early-life infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with aberrant expression of the prototypical neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) and its cognate receptors in human bronchial epithelium. However, the chain of events leading to this outcome, and its functional implications for the progression of the viral infection, has not been elucidated. This study sought to test the hypothesis that RSV infection modulates neurotrophic pathways in human airways by silencing the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs), and that this effect favors viral growth by interfering with programmed death of infected cells.

METHODOLOGY: Human bronchial epithelial cells infected with green fluorescent protein-expressing RSV (rgRSV) were screened with multiplex qPCR arrays, and miRNAs significantly affected by the virus were analyzed for homology with mRNAs encoding neurotrophic factors or receptors. Mimic sequences of selected miRNAs were transfected into non-infected bronchial cells to confirm the role of each of them in regulating neurotrophins expression at the gene and protein level, and to study their influence on cell cycle and viral replication.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RSV caused downregulation of 24 miRNAs and upregulation of 2 (p<0.01). Homology analysis of microarray data revealed that 6 of those miRNAs exhibited a high degree of complementarity to NGF and/or one of its cognate receptors TrKA and p75(NTR). Among the selected miRNAs, miR-221 was significantly downregulated by RSV and its transfection in bronchial epithelial cells maximally inhibited gene and protein expression of NGF and TrKA, increased apoptotic cell death, and reduced viral replication and infectivity.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that RSV upregulates the NGF-TrKA axis in human airways by silencing miR-221 expression, and this favors viral replication by interfering with the apoptotic death of infected cells. Consequently, the targeted delivery of exogenous miRNAs to the airways may provide a new strategy for future antiviral therapies based on RNA interference.
23056391	Respiratory syncytial virus reverses airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.	2012	PLoS One	Each year, approximately 20% of asthmatics in the United States experience acute symptom exacerbations, which commonly result from pulmonary viral infections. The majority of asthma exacerbations in very young children follow infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, pathogenic mechanisms underlying induction of asthma exacerbations by RSV are not well understood. We therefore investigated the effect of post-sensitization RSV infection on lung function in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice as a model of RSV asthma exacerbations. OVA sensitization of uninfected female BALB/c mice increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) eosinophil levels and induced airway hyperresponsiveness to the muscarinic agonist methacholine, as measured by the forced-oscillation technique. In contrast, intranasal infection with replication-competent RSV strain A2 for 2-8 days reduced BALF eosinophil counts and reversed airway hyperresponsiveness in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. BALF levels of the chemokine keratinocyte cytokine (KC; a murine homolog of interleukin-8) were elevated in OVA-sensitized, RSV-infected mice and reversal of methacholine hyperresponsiveness in these animals was rapidly inhibited by KC neutralization. Hyporesponsiveness could be induced in OVA-sensitized, uninfected mice by recombinant KC or the Gαi agonist melittin. These data suggest that respiratory syncytial virus induces KC-mediated activation of Gαi, resulting in cross-inhibition of Gαq-mediated M(3)-muscarinic receptor signaling and reversal of airway hyperresponsiveness. As in unsensitized mice, KC therefore appears to play a significant role in induction of airway dysfunction by respiratory syncytial virus. Hence, interleukin-8 may be a promising therapeutic target to normalize lung function in both asthmatics and non-asthmatics with bronchiolitis. However, the OVA-sensitized, RSV-infected mouse may not be an appropriate model for investigating the pathogenesis of viral asthma exacerbations.
22403603	Differential, phosphorylation dependent trafficking of AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells.	2012	PLoS One	The kidney maintains water homeostasis by modulating aquaporin 2 (AQP2) on the plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells in response to vasopressin (VP). VP mediated phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 is critical for this effect. However, the role of phosphorylation of other serine residues in the AQP2 C-terminus is less well understood. Here, we examined the effect of phosphorylation of S256, S261 and S269 on AQP2 trafficking and association with recycling pathway markers. We used LLC-PK1 cells expressing AQP2(S-D) or (S-A) phospho mutants and a 20°C cold block, which allows endocytosis to continue, but prevents protein exit from the trans Golgi network (TGN), inducing formation of a perinuclear AQP2 patch. AQP2-S256D persists on the plasma membrane during cold block, while wild type AQP2, AQP2-S256A, S261A, S269A and S269D are internalized and accumulate in the patch. Development of this patch, a measure of AQP2 internalization, was most rapid with AQP2-S256A, and slowest with S261A and S269D. AQP2-S269D exhibited a biphasic internalization profile with a significant amount not internalized until 150 minutes of cold block. After rewarming to 37°C, wt AQP2, AQP2-S261A and AQP2-S269D rapidly redistributed throughout the cytoplasm within 20 minutes, whereas AQP2-S256A dissipated more slowly. Colocalization of AQP2 mutants with several key vesicular markers including clathrin, HSP70/HSC70, EEA, GM130 and Rab11 revealed no major differences. Overall, our data provide evidence supporting the role of S256 and S269 in the maintenance of AQP2 at the cell surface and reveal the dynamics of internalization and recycling of differentially phosphorylated AQP2 in cell culture.
22383950	Respiratory syncytial virus NS1 protein colocalizes with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS following infection.	2012	PLoS One	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nonstructural protein 1(NS1) attenuates type-I interferon (IFN) production during RSV infection; however the precise role of RSV NS1 protein in orchestrating the early host-virus interaction during infection is poorly understood. Since NS1 constitutes the first RSV gene transcribed and the production of IFN depends upon RLR (RIG-I-like receptor) signaling, we reasoned that NS1 may interfere with this signaling. Herein, we report that NS1 is localized to mitochondria and binds to mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Live-cell imaging of rgRSV-infected A549 human epithelial cells showed that RSV replication and transcription occurs in proximity to mitochondria. NS1 localization to mitochondria was directly visualized by confocal microscopy using a cell-permeable chemical probe for His(6)-NS1. Further, NS1 colocalization with MAVS in A549 cells infected with RSV was shown by confocal laser microscopy and immuno-electron microscopy. NS1 protein is present in the mitochondrial fraction and co-immunoprecipitates with MAVS in total cell lysatesof A549 cells transfected with the plasmid pNS1-Flag. By immunoprecipitation with anti-RIG-I antibody, RSV NS1 was shown to associate with MAVS at an early stage of RSV infection, and to disrupt MAVS interaction with RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene) and the downstream IFN antiviral and inflammatory response. Together, these results demonstrate that NS1 binds to MAVS and that this binding inhibits the MAVS-RIG-I interaction required for IFN production.
22470426	Genetic variability of human respiratory syncytial virus A strains circulating in Ontario: a novel genotype with a 72 nucleotide G gene duplication.	2012	PLoS One	Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. We investigated the genetic variability of RSV-A circulating in Ontario during 2010-2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the G glycoprotein gene.Among the 201 consecutive RSV isolates studied, RSV-A (55.7%) was more commonly observed than RSV-B (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of RSV-A infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. On phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 RSV-A strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the NA1 genotype; two isolates were GA5 genotype. Eleven (10%) NA1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel RSV-A genotype, named ON1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the C-terminal region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein. The predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. Using RNA secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. The 23 amino acid ON1 G gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential O-glycosylation sites including three O-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. Using Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among Ontario NA1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype RSV-A2 strain. The tendency of codon regression in the G-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. Further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel RSV-A genotype with a72 nucleotide G gene duplication.
22384158	Human platelet-rich plasma- and extracellular matrix-derived peptides promote impaired cutaneous wound healing in vivo.	2012	PLoS One	Previous work in our laboratory has described several pro-angiogenic short peptides derived from endothelial extracellular matrices degraded by bacterial collagenase. Here we tested whether these peptides could stimulate wound healing in vivo. Our experiments demonstrated that a peptide created as combination of fragments of tenascin X and fibrillin 1 (comb1) applied into cranial dermal wounds created in mice treated with cyclophosphamide to impair wound healing, can improve the rate of wound closure. Furthermore, we identify and characterize a novel peptide (UN3) created and modified from two naturally-occurring peptides, which are present in human platelet-rich plasma. In vitro testing of UN3 demonstrates that it causes a 50% increase in endothelial proliferation, 250% increase in angiogenic response and a tripling of epithelial cell migration in response to injury. Results of in vivo experiments where comb1 and UN3 peptides were added together to cranial wounds in cyclophosphamide-treated mice leads to improvement of wound vascularization as shown by an increase of the number of blood vessels present in the wound beds. Application of the peptides markedly promotes cellular responses to injury and essentially restores wound healing dynamics to those of normal, acute wounds in the absence of cyclophosphamide impairment. Our current work is aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of these peptides as well as identification of the cellular receptors mediating these effects.
22927950	Gene expression profiling during conidiation in the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	PLoS One	Conidiation of phytopathogenic fungi is a key developmental process that plays a central role in their life cycles and in epidemics. However, there is little information on conidiation-induced molecular changes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. As a first step to understand conidiogenesis in this fungus, we measured genome-wide gene expression profiles during conidiation using a whole genome oligonucleotide microarray. At a two-fold expression difference, approximately 4.42% and 4.08% of genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during conidiation. The differentially expressed genes were functionally categorized by gene ontology (GO) term analysis, which demonstrated that the gene set encoded proteins that function in metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, transcription, and molecule transport. To define the events of the complicated process of conidiogenesis, another set of microarray experiments was performed using a deletion mutant for MoHOX2, a stage-specific transcriptional regulator essential for conidial formation, which was expressed de novo in a conidiation-specific manner in M. oryzae. Gene expression profiles were compared between the wild-type and the ΔMohox2 mutant during conidiation. This analysis defined a common gene set that was upregulated in the wild-type and downregulated in the ΔMohox2 mutant during conidiation; this gene set is expected to include conidiation-related downstream genes of MoHOX2. We identified several hundred genes that are differentially-expressed during conidiation; our results serve as an important resource for understanding the conidiation, a process in M. oryzae, which is critical for disease development.
22590614	Immunogenicity and protective capacity of a virosomal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A in mice.	2012	PLoS One	Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of viral brochiolitis in infants and young children and is also a significant problem in elderly and immuno-compromised adults. To date there is no efficacious and safe RSV vaccine, partially because of the outcome of a clinical trial in the 1960s with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV). This vaccine caused enhanced respiratory disease upon exposure to the live virus, leading to increased morbidity and the death of two children. Subsequent analyses of this incident showed that FI-RSV induces a Th2-skewed immune response together with poorly neutralizing antibodies. As a new approach, we used reconstituted RSV viral envelopes, i.e. virosomes, with incorporated monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity and to skew the immune response towards a Th1 phenotype. Incorporation of MPLA stimulated the overall immunogenicity of the virosomes compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes in mice. Intramuscular administration of the vaccine led to the induction of RSV-specific IgG2a levels similar to those induced by inoculation of the animals with live RSV. These antibodies were able to neutralize RSV in vitro. Furthermore, MPLA-adjuvanted RSV virosomes induced high amounts of IFNγ and low amounts of IL5 in both spleens and lungs of immunized and subsequently challenged animals, compared to levels of these cytokines in animals vaccinated with FI-RSV, indicating a Th1-skewed response. Mice vaccinated with RSV-MPLA virosomes were protected from live RSV challenge, clearing the inoculated virus without showing signs of lung pathology. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RSV-MPLA virosomes represent a safe and efficacious vaccine candidate which warrants further evaluation.
22662266	Respiratory syncytial virus matrix protein induces lung epithelial cell cycle arrest through a p53 dependent pathway.	2012	PLoS One	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of viral respiratory infections in children. Our previous study showed that the RSV infection induced lung epithelial cell cycle arrest, which enhanced virus replication. To address the mechanism of RSV-induced cell cycle arrest, we examined the contribution of RSV-matrix (RSV-M) protein. In this report, we show that in both the A549 cell line and primary human bronchial epithelial (PHBE) cells, transfection with RSV-M protein caused the cells to proliferate at a slower rate than in control cells. The cell cycle analysis showed that RSV-M protein induced G1 phase arrest in A549 cells, and G1 and G2/M phase arrest in PHBE cells. Interestingly, RSV-M expression induced p53 and p21 accumulation and decreased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Further, induction of cell cycle arrest by RSV-M was not observed in a p53-deficient epithelial cell line (H1299). However, cell cycle arrest was restored after transfection of p53 cDNA into H1299 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that RSV-M protein regulates lung epithelial cell cycle through a p53-dependent pathway, which enhances RSV replication.
22655066	Nucleoprotein nanostructures combined with adjuvants adapted to the neonatal immune context: a candidate mucosal RSV vaccine.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the leading cause of severe bronchiolitis in infants worldwide. The most severe RSV diseases occur between 2 and 6 months-of-age, so pediatric vaccination will have to be started within the first weeks after birth, when the immune system is prone to Th2 responses that may turn deleterious upon exposure to the virus. So far, the high risk to prime for immunopathological responses in infants has hampered the development of vaccine. In the present study we investigated the safety and efficacy of ring-nanostructures formed by the recombinant nucleoprotein N of hRSV (N(SRS)) as a mucosal vaccine candidate against RSV in BALB/c neonates, which are highly sensitive to immunopathological Th2 imprinting.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A single intranasal administration of N(SRS) with detoxified E. coli enterotoxin LT(R192G) to 5-7 day old neonates provided a significant reduction of the viral load after an RSV challenge at five weeks of age. However, neonatal vaccination also generated an enhanced lung infiltration by neutrophils and eosinophils following the RSV challenge. Analysis of antibody subclasses and cytokines produced after an RSV challenge or a boost administration of the vaccine suggested that neonatal vaccination induced a Th2 biased local immune memory. This Th2 bias and the eosinophilic reaction could be prevented by adding CpG to the vaccine formulation, which, however did not prevent pulmonary inflammation and neutrophil infiltration upon viral challenge.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, protective vaccination against RSV can be achieved in neonates but requires an appropriate combination of adjuvants to prevent harmful Th2 imprinting.
22393401	IL-10 regulates viral lung immunopathology during acute respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice.	2012	PLoS One	Interleukin (IL-) 10 is a pleiotropic cytokine with broad immunosuppressive functions, particularly at mucosal sites such as the intestine and lung. Here we demonstrate that infection of BALB/c mice with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced IL-10 production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the airways at later time points (e.g. day 8); a proportion of these cells also co-produced IFN-γ. Furthermore, RSV infection of IL-10(-/-) mice resulted in more severe disease with enhanced weight loss, delayed recovery and greater cell infiltration of the respiratory tract without affecting viral load. In addition, IL-10(-/-) mice had a pronounced airway neutrophilia and heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, the proportion of lung T cells producing IFN-γ was enhanced, suggesting that IL-10 may act in an autocrine manner to dampen effector T cell responses. Similar findings were made in mice treated with anti-IL-10R antibody and infected with RSV. Therefore, IL-10 inhibits disease and inflammation in mice infected with RSV, especially during recovery from infection.
22574108	IL1RL1 gene variants and nasopharyngeal IL1RL-a levels are associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis: a multicenter cohort study.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Targets for intervention are required for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, a common disease during infancy for which no effective treatment exists. Clinical and genetic studies indicate that IL1RL1 plays an important role in the development and exacerbations of asthma. Human IL1RL1 encodes three isoforms, including soluble IL1RL1-a, that can influence IL33 signalling by modifying inflammatory responses to epithelial damage. We hypothesized that IL1RL1 gene variants and soluble IL1RL1-a are associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied the association between RSV and 3 selected IL1RL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1921622, rs11685480 or rs1420101 in 81 ventilated and 384 non-ventilated children under 1 year of age hospitalized with primary RSV bronchiolitis in comparison to 930 healthy controls. Severe RSV infection was defined by need for mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, we examined soluble IL1RL1-a concentration in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children hospitalized with primary RSV bronchiolitis. An association between SNP rs1921622 and disease severity was found at the allele and genotype level (p = 0.011 and p = 0.040, respectively). In hospitalized non-ventilated patients, RSV bronchiolitis was not associated with IL1RL1 genotypes. Median concentrations of soluble IL1RL1-a in nasopharyngeal aspirates were >20-fold higher in ventilated infants when compared to non-ventilated infants with RSV (median [and quartiles] 9,357 [936-15,528] pg/ml vs. 405 [112-1,193] pg/ml respectively; p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: We found a genetic link between rs1921622 IL1RL1 polymorphism and disease severity in RSV bronchiolitis. The potential biological role of IL1RL1 in the pathogenesis of severe RSV bronchiolitis was further supported by high local concentrations of IL1RL1 in children with most severe disease. We speculate that IL1RL1a modifies epithelial damage mediated inflammatory responses during RSV bronchiolitis and thus may serve as a novel target for intervention to control disease severity.
22511982	Transgenic Cry1Ab rice does not impact ecological fitness and predation of a generalist spider.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The commercial release of rice genetically engineered to express a Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for control of Lepidoptera in China is a subject of debate. One major point of the debate has focused on the ecological safety of Bt rice on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of insect pests.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A tritrophic bioassay was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of Cry1Ab-expressing rice on fitness parameters of a predaceous ground spider (Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bösenberg et Strand)) that had fed on Bt rice-fed brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)) nymphs. Survival, development time and fecundity of this spider were not different when they were fed with Bt rice-fed or non-Bt rice-fed prey. Furthermore, ELISA and PCR gut assays, as well as a functional response trial, indicated that predation by P. pseudoannulata was not significantly different in Bt rice or non-Bt rice fields.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The transgenic Cry1Ab rice lines tested in this study had no adverse effects on the survival, developmental time and fecundity of P. pseudoannulata in the laboratory or on predation under field conditions. This suggests that this important predator would not be harmed if transgenic Cry1Ab rice were commercialized.
22792355	Stimulation of immature lung macrophages with intranasal interferon gamma in a novel neonatal mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection.	2012	PLoS One	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Reduced CD8 T-cells and negligible interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the airway are associated with severe infant RSV disease, yet there is an abundance of alveolar macrophages (AM) and neutrophils. However, it is unclear, based on our current understanding of macrophage functional heterogeneity, if immature AM improve viral clearance or contribute to inflammation and airway obstruction in the IFNγ-deficient neonatal lung environment. The aim of the current study was to define the age-dependent AM phenotype during neonatal RSV infection and investigate their differentiation to classically activated macrophages (CAM) using i.n. IFNγ in the context of improving viral clearance. Neonatal and adult BALB/cJ mice were infected with 1×10(6) plaque forming units (PFU)/gram (g) RSV line 19 and their AM responses compared. Adult mice showed a rapid and robust CAM response, indicated by increases in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), CD86, CCR7, and a reduction in mannose receptor (MR). Neonatal mice showed a delayed and reduced CAM response, likely due to undetectable IFNγ production. Intranasal (i.n.) treatment with recombinant mouse IFNγ (rIFNγ) increased the expression of CAM markers on neonatal AM, reduced viral lung titers, and improved weight gain compared to untreated controls with no detectable increase in CD4 or CD8 T-cell infiltration. In vitro infection of J774A.1 macrophages with RSV induced an alternatively activated macrophage (AAM) phenotype however, when macrophages were first primed with IFNγ, a CAM phenotype was induced and RSV spread to adjacent Hep-2 cells was reduced. These studies demonstrate that the neonatal AM response to RSV infection is abundant and immature, but can be exogenously stimulated to express the antimicrobial phenotype, CAM, with i.n. rIFNγ.
22511929	A genome-wide survey of switchgrass genome structure and organization.	2012	PLoS One	The perennial grass, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), is a promising bioenergy crop and the target of whole genome sequencing. We constructed two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries from the AP13 clone of switchgrass to gain insight into the genome structure and organization, initiate functional and comparative genomic studies, and assist with genome assembly. Together representing 16 haploid genome equivalents of switchgrass, each library comprises 101,376 clones with average insert sizes of 144 (HindIII-generated) and 110 kb (BstYI-generated). A total of 330,297 high quality BAC-end sequences (BES) were generated, accounting for 263.2 Mbp (16.4%) of the switchgrass genome. Analysis of the BES identified 279,099 known repetitive elements, >50,000 SSRs, and 2,528 novel repeat elements, named switchgrass repetitive elements (SREs). Comparative mapping of 47 full-length BAC sequences and 330K BES revealed high levels of synteny with the grass genomes sorghum, rice, maize, and Brachypodium. Our data indicate that the sorghum genome has retained larger microsyntenous regions with switchgrass besides high gene order conservation with rice. The resources generated in this effort will be useful for a broad range of applications.
22905186	Arabidopsis MDA1, a nuclear-encoded protein, functions in chloroplast development and abiotic stress responses.	2012	PLoS One	Most chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, whose functions remain largely unknown because mutant alleles are lacking. A reverse genetics screen for mutations affecting the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) family in Arabidopsis thaliana allowed us to identify 75 lines carrying T-DNA insertions. Two of them were homozygous for insertions in the At4g14605 gene, which we dubbed MDA1 (MTERF DEFECTIVE IN Arabidopsis1). The mda1 mutants exhibited altered chloroplast morphology and plant growth, and reduced pigmentation of cotyledons, leaves, stems and sepals. The mda1 mutations enhanced salt and osmotic stress tolerance and altered sugar responses during seedling establishment, possibly as a result of reduced ABA sensitivity. Loss of MDA1 function caused up-regulation of the RpoTp/SCA3 nuclear gene encoding a plastid RNA polymerase and modified the steady-state levels of chloroplast gene transcripts. Double mutant analyses indicated that MDA1 and the previously described mTERF genes SOLDAT10 and RUG2 act in different pathways. Our findings reveal a new role for mTERF proteins in the response to abiotic stress, probably through perturbed ABA retrograde signalling resulting from a disruption in chloroplast homeostasis.
24191617	Present status and approaches for the sustainable development of community based fish culture in seasonal floodplains of Bangladesh.	2012	Pak J Biol Sci	Coordination among the different stakeholders at policy planning, implementation and target beneficiary level, particularly among the agencies responsible for development and management of water resources, agriculture and fisheries, is essential for overall sustainable development. Stocking of larger fingerlings at suitable stocking densities of endemic (rohu, catla, mrigal) and exotic (silver carp, bighead carp, common carp/mirror carp) species should be stocked at varying proportion. Floodplain fish production depends only on the natural fertility of the water bodies. Technological interventions should include the installation of low cost bamboo fencing at water inlet and outlet points and setting of ring culverts for maintaining suitable levels of water for fish culture without hampering the production of rice and other crops in the intervention areas, selective stocking with native and exotic carps, restricted fishing for certain period of time and guarding. It is expected to exert positive influences in enhancing the standing crop and biodiversity of non-stocked species of fishes in the intervention seasonal floodplain. Entry of fish larvae, hatchlings and young fry of wild non-stocked fishes into the seasonal floodplains because of large fence spacing (approximately 1.0 cm), could restrict fishing for certain period, undisturbed habitat and guarding could contribute to higher productivity and enhancement of fish biodiversity in the seasonal floodplains. Proper motivation and effective cooperation of the beneficiaries are extremely important to culture fish in the seasonal floodplains under community based management system. Institutional support and constant vigilance from the Department of Fisheries (DoF) and local administrations are indispensable to ensure the sustainability of fish culture initiatives in the seasonal floodplains. Active participation and involvement of the local community people in all stages of fish culture operation beginning from selection of floodplains, formation of floodplain management committee, planning of fish culture activities, exercise of technical intervention, selective stocking with large fingerlings, guarding, monitoring and supervision, adopting harvesting strategies, marketing and distribution of benefits are extremely essential to ensure sustainability of the program. Mutual trust, sense of respect and good working relationship among the committee members are the basic social elements required for the success of community based fish culture initiatives.
22970579	EZ Gluten for the qualitative detection of gluten in foods, beverages, and environmental surfaces.	None	J AOAC Int	The EZ Gluten assay is a rapid immunochromatographic screening method for qualitative detection of gluten in raw and cooked foods and beverages and on environmental surfaces. This AOAC Performance Tested Method study evaluated the EZ Gluten assay as an effective method for the detection of gluten in four selected matrixes: rice flour, cooked dough, beer, and dog food. In addition, the method was evaluated for its effectiveness in detecting gluten contamination of > or =1 microg/2 in.2 (25 cm2) stainless steel surface area. The EZ Gluten demonstrated 100% specificity [probability of detection (POD) 0.00, confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.01] and 99% sensitivity (POD 0.99, CI 0.97-0.995) at the 10 ppm level for all four matrixes, and 100% specificity (POD 0.00, CI 0.00-0.11) and sensitivity (POD 1.00, CI 0.886-1.00) at the 1 microg level on the stainless steel surface. Independent laboratory testing confirmed the internal validation results in one matrix and on the stainless steel surface. Lot-to-lot, stability, and robustness studies provided evidence that the EZ Gluten is a rugged, consistent method for the detection of gluten at levels as low as 10 ppm.
22943499	Lesser grain borers, Rhyzopertha dominica, select rough rice kernels with cracked hulls for reproduction.	2012	J Insect Sci	Tests were conducted to determine whether the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae), selects rough rice (Oryza sativa L. (Poales: Poaceae)) kernels with cracked hulls for reproduction when these kernels are mixed with intact kernels. Differing amounts of kernels with cracked hulls (0, 5, 10, and 20%) of the varieties Francis and Wells were mixed with intact kernels, and the number of adult progeny emerging from intact kernels and from kernels with cracked hulls was determined. The Wells variety had been previously classified as tolerant to R. dominica, while the Francis variety was classified as moderately susceptible. Few F 1 progeny were produced in Wells regardless of the percentage of kernels with cracked hulls, few of the kernels with cracked hulls had emergence holes, and little firass was produced from feeding damage. At 10 and 20% kernels with cracked hulls, the progeny production, number of emergence holes in kernels with cracked hulls, and the amount of firass was greater in Francis than in Wells. The proportion of progeny emerging from kernels with cracked hulls increased as the proportion of kernels with cracked hulls increased. The results indicate that R. dominica select kernels with cracked hulls for reproduction.
23231659	Endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase gene families in the grasses: temporal and spatial co-transcription of orthologous genes.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase (cellulase) glycosyl hydrolase GH9 enzymes have been implicated in several aspects of cell wall metabolism in higher plants, including cellulose biosynthesis and degradation, modification of other wall polysaccharides that contain contiguous (1,4)-β-glucosyl residues, and wall loosening during cell elongation.

RESULTS: The endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase gene families from barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) range in size from 23 to 29 members. Phylogenetic analyses show variations in clade structure between the grasses and Arabidopsis, and indicate differential gene loss and gain during evolution. Map positions and comparative studies of gene structures allow orthologous genes in the five species to be identified and synteny between the grasses is found to be high. It is also possible to differentiate between homoeologues resulting from ancient polyploidizations of the maize genome. Transcript analyses using microarray, massively parallel signature sequencing and quantitative PCR data for barley, rice and maize indicate that certain members of the endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase gene family are transcribed across a wide range of tissues, while others are specifically transcribed in particular tissues. There are strong correlations between transcript levels of several members of the endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase family and the data suggest that evolutionary conservation of transcription exists between orthologues across the grass family. There are also strong correlations between certain members of the endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase family and other genes known to be involved in cell wall loosening and cell expansion, such as expansins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases.

CONCLUSIONS: The identification of these groups of genes will now allow us to test hypotheses regarding their functions and joint participation in wall synthesis, re-modelling and degradation, together with their potential role in lignocellulose conversion during biofuel production from grasses and cereal crop residues.
22695859	One millimetre makes the difference: high-resolution analysis of methane-oxidizing bacteria and their specific activity at the oxic-anoxic interface in a flooded paddy soil.	2012	ISME J	Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) use a restricted substrate range, yet >30 species-equivalent operational taxonomical units (OTUs) are found in one paddy soil. How these OTUs physically share their microhabitat is unknown. Here we highly resolved the vertical distribution of MOB and their activity. Using microcosms and cryosectioning, we sub-sampled the top 3-mm of a water-saturated soil at near in situ conditions in 100-μm steps. We assessed the community structure and activity using the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA as a functional and phylogenetic marker by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP), a pmoA-specific diagnostic microarray, and cloning and sequencing. pmoA genes and transcripts were quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase PCR combined with t-RFLP. Only a subset of the methanotroph community was active. Oxygen microprofiles showed that 89% of total respiration was confined to a 0.67-mm-thick zone immediately above the oxic-anoxic interface, most probably driven by methane oxidation. In this zone, a Methylobacter-affiliated OTU was highly active with up to 18 pmoA transcripts per cell and seemed to be adapted to oxygen and methane concentrations in the micromolar range. Analysis of transcripts with a pmoA-specific microarray found a Methylosarcina-affiliated OTU associated with the surface zone. High oxygen but only nanomolar methane concentrations at the surface suggested an adaptation of this OTU to oligotrophic conditions. No transcripts of type II methanotrophs (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) were found, which indicated that this group was represented by resting stages only. Hence, different OTUs within a single guild shared the same microenvironment and exploited different niches.
24004611	Abscisic acid induced freezing tolerance in chilling-sensitive suspension cultures and seedlings of rice.	2013	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: The role of abscisic acid (ABA) as a possible activator of cold acclimation process was postulated since endogenous levels of ABA increase temporarily or constitutively during cold-hardening. Exogenous application of ABA has been known to induce freezing tolerance at ambient temperatures in in vitro systems derived from cold hardy plants. Yet, some cell cultures acquired much greater freezing tolerance by ABA than by cold whilst maintaining active growth. This raises questions about the relationships among ABA, cold acclimation and growth cessation. To address this question, we attempted to 1) determine whether exogenous ABA can confer freezing tolerance in chilling-sensitive rice suspension cells and seedlings, which obviously lack the mechanisms to acquire freezing tolerance in response to cold; 2) characterize this phenomenon by optimizing the conditions and compare with the case of cold hardy bromegrass cells.

RESULTS: Non-embryogenic suspension cells of rice suffered serious chilling injury when exposed to 4°C. When incubated with ABA at the optimal conditions (0.5-1 g cell inoculum, 75 μM ABA, 25-30°C, 7-10 days), they survived slow freezing (2°C/h) to -9.0 ~ -9.3°C (LT50: 50% killing temperature) while control cells were mostly injured at -3°C (LT50: -0.5 ~ -1.5°C). Ice-inoculation of the cell suspension at -3°C and survival determination by regrowth confirmed that ABA-treated rice cells survived extracellular freezing at -9°C. ABA-induced freezing tolerance did not require any exposure to cold and was best achieved at 25-30°C where the rice cells maintained high growth even in the presence of ABA. ABA treatment also increased tolerance to heat (43°C) as determined by regrowth. ABA-treated cells tended to have more augmented cytoplasm and/or reduced vacuole sizes compared to control cultures with a concomitant increase in osmolarity and a decrease in water content. ABA-treated (2-7 days) in vitro grown seedlings and their leaves survived slow freezing to -3°C with only marginal injury (LT50: -4°C) whereas untreated seedlings were killed at -3°C (LT50: -2°C).

CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that exogenous ABA can induce some levels of freezing tolerance in chilling-sensitive rice cells and seedlings, probably by eliciting mechanisms different from low temperature-induced cold acclimation.
24047253	Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus alters insect vectors' host orientation preferences to enhance spread and increase rice ragged stunt virus co-infection.	2014	Phytopathology	In recent years, Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a tentative species in the genus Fijivirus (family Reoviridae), has spread rapidly and caused serious rice losses in eastern and southeastern Asia. With this virus spread, Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV, genus Oryzavirus, family Reoviridae) became more common in southern China, usually in co-infection with the former. SRBSDV and RRSV are transmitted by two different species of planthoppers, white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) and brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), respectively, in a persistent, circulative, propagative manner. In this study, using a Y-shape olfactometer-based device, we tested the host preference of three types of macropterous WBPH adults for healthy or SRBSDV-infected rice plants. The results showed that virus-free WBPHs significantly preferred infected rice plants to healthy plants, whereas both the viruliferous and nonviruliferous WBPHs preferred healthy plants to infected plants. In additional tests, we found that the BPHs significantly preferred healthy plants when they were virus free, whereas RRSV-carrying BPHs preferred SRBSDV-infected rice plants. From these findings, we propose that plant viruses may alter host selection preference of vectors to enhance their spread and that of insects vectoring another virus to result in co-infection with more than one virus.
24040375	Health risk assessment of heavy metals in rice to the population in Zhejiang, China.	2013	PLoS One	Environmental pollution with toxic heavy metals can lead to the possible contamination of the rice. Selected metals (As, Cd, Hg and Pb) and their accumulation in rice collected from Zhejiang, China were analyzed to evaluate the potential health risk to the local adults and children. The mean levels found in rice were as follows: As, 0.080 mg/kg; Cd, 0.037 mg/kg; Hg, 0.005 mg/kg; Pb, 0.060 mg/kg. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) were calculated in combination of the rice consumption data. The mean intakes of As, Cd, Hg and Pb through rice were estimated to be 0.49, 0.23, 0.03 and 0.37 µg/kg bw/day for adults, and 0.34, 0.29, 0.04 and 0.47 µg/kg bw/day for children. The 97.5th percentile (P97.5) daily intakes of As, Cd, Hg and Pb were 1.02, 0.64, 0.37 and 1.26 µg/kg bw/day for adults, and 0.63, 0.83, 0.47 and 1.63 µg/kg bw/day for children. The risk assessment in mean levels showed that health risk associated with these elements through consumption of rice was absent. However, estimates in P97.5 level of Cd and Pb for children, and Hg for adults have exceeded the respective safe limits.
23849114	Metabolite profiling of the short-term responses of rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Ilmi) cultivated under different LED lights and its correlations with antioxidant activities.	2013	Plant Sci	Metabolite profiling of rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Ilmi) was performed to investigate the short-term responses to different light-emitting diode (LED) lights, blue (B), green (G), red (R), white (W), shade (S), by using gas chromatography-ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC-IT-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) with multivariate analysis. Clear grouping patterns of each light-grown sample, except G and W, were shown in partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Thirty-two primary metabolites and eleven secondary metabolites were selected and visualized using heatmap. Antioxidant activities of rice leaves followed the order B=W=G>R>S and isoorientin-2''-O-glucoside, isovitexin-2''-O-glucoside, isoorientin-2''-O-(6'''-ρ-coumaroyl)-glucoside, and isoscoparin-2''-O-glucoside showed similar relative differences and had higher Pearson's correlation coefficients than other metabolites in correlation network. According to the orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) between B and R, the levels of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, and flavonoid glycosides were relatively high in B, whereas the glucose and fructose levels were high in R.
24090830	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in e-waste: level and transfer in a typical e-waste recycling site in Shanghai, Eastern China.	2014	Waste Manag	Very few data for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were available in the electronic waste (e-waste) as one of the most PBDEs emission source. This study reported concentrations of PBDEs in e-waste including printer, rice cooker, computer monitor, TV, electric iron and water dispenser, as well as dust from e-waste, e-waste dismantling workshop and surface soil from inside and outside of an e-waste recycling plant in Shanghai, Eastern China. The results showed that PBDEs were detected in the majority of e-waste, and the concentrations of ΣPBDEs ranged from not detected to 175 g/kg, with a mean value of 10.8 g/kg. PBDEs were found in TVs made in China after 1990. The mean concentrations of ΣPBDEs in e-waste made in Korea, Japan, Singapore and China were 1.84 g/kg, 20.5 g/kg, 0.91 g/kg, 4.48 g/kg, respectively. The levels of ΣPBDEs in e-waste made in Japan far exceed the threshold limit of RoHS (1.00 g/kg). BDE-209 dominated in e-waste, accounting for over 93%. The compositional patterns of PBDEs congeners resembled the profile of Saytex 102E, indicating the source of deca-BDE. Among the samples of dust and surface soil from a typical e-waste recycling site, the highest concentrations of Σ18PBDEs and BDE-209 were found in dust in e-waste, ranging from 1960 to 340,710 ng/g and from 910 to 320,400 ng/g, which were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than other samples. It suggested that PBDEs released from e-waste via dust, and then transferred to surrounding environment.
24163626	Emission of carbon dioxide influenced by different water levels from soil incubated organic residues.	2013	ScientificWorldJournal	We studied the influence of different organic residues and water levels on decomposition rate and carbon sequestration in soil. Organic residues (rice straw, rice root, cow dung, and poultry litter) including control were tested under moistened and flooding systems. An experiment was laid out as a complete randomized design at 25°C for 120 days. Higher CO₂-C (265.45 mg) emission was observed in moistened condition than in flooding condition from 7 to 120 days. Among the organic residues, poultry litter produced the highest CO₂-C emission. Poultry litter with soil mixture increased 121% cumulative CO₂-C compared to control. On average, about 38% of added poultry litter C was mineralized to CO₂-C. Maximum CO₂-C was found in 7 days after incubation and thereafter CO₂-C emission was decreased with the increase of time. Control produced the lowest CO₂-C (158.23 mg). Poultry litter produced maximum cumulative CO₂-C (349.91 mg). Maximum organic carbon was obtained in cow dung which followed by other organic residues. Organic residues along with flooding condition decreased cumulative CO₂-C, k value and increased organic C in soil. Maximum k value was found in poultry litter and control. Incorpored rice straw increased organic carbon and decreased k value (0.003 g d⁻¹) in soil. In conclusion, rice straw and poultry litter were suitable for improving soil carbon.
24068225	Validity and reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire to assess food group intake in adolescents.	2013	Cad Saude Publica	The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire to assess intake of the food groups included in the food guide pyramid for adolescents (FFQ-FP). The final version of the FFQ-FP consisted of 50 food items. The study was carried out with a sample of 109 adolescents over a period of four months. A 24hr recall (24hr) was conducted four times and the FFQ-FP was conducted twice. Validity was determined by comparing the second FFQ-FP and the mean of the four 24hrs, while reproducibility was verified by comparing the results of the two FFQ-FPs. Statistical analysis was carried out using medians, standard deviations, Pearson and intraclass correlations and Kappa statistics to assess concordance. Best results were achieved for the rice (including bread, grains and starches), meats and sugars groups. Weakest correlation was observed for the variable vitamin C. The validity and reproducibility of the FFQ-FP was satisfactory for most variables.
24190103	Highly efficient genotyping of rice biparental populations by GoldenGate assays based on parental resequencing.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A new time- and cost-effective strategy was developed for medium-density SNP genotyping of rice biparental populations, using GoldenGate assays based on parental resequencing. Since the advent of molecular markers, crop researchers and breeders have dedicated huge amounts of effort to detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) in biparental populations for genetic analysis and marker-assisted selection (MAS). In this study, we developed a new time- and cost-effective strategy for genotyping a population of progeny from a rice cross using medium-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using this strategy, 728,362 "high quality" SNPs were identified by resequencing Teqing and Lemont, the parents of the population. We selected 384 informative SNPs that were evenly distributed across the genome for genotyping the biparental population using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. 335 (87.2 %) validated SNPs were used for further genetic analyses. After removing segregation distortion markers, 321 SNPs were used for linkage map construction and QTL mapping. This strategy generated SNP markers distributed more evenly across the genome than previous SSR assays. Taking the GW5 gene that controls grain shape as an example, our strategy provided higher accuracy (0.8 Mb) and significance (LOD 5.5 and 10.1) in QTL mapping than SSR analysis. Our study thus provides a rapid and efficient strategy for genetic studies and QTL mapping using SNP genotyping assays.
24243826	Rapid analysis of aflatoxins B1, B2, and ochratoxin A in rice samples using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with HPLC.	2014	J Sep Sci	A novel, simple, and rapid method is presented for the analysis of aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2, and ochratoxin A in rice samples by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with LC and fluorescence detection. After extraction of the rice samples with a mixture of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid, mycotoxins were rapidly partitioned into a small volume of organic solvent (chloroform) by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. The three mycotoxins were simultaneously determined by LC with fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization for aflatoxin B1 and B2. Parameters affecting both extraction and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedures, including the extraction solvent, the type and volume of extractant, the volume of dispersive solvent, the addition of salt, the pH and the extraction time, were optimized. The optimized protocol provided an enrichment factor of approximately 1.25 and with detection of limits (0.06-0.5 μg/kg) below the maximum levels imposed by current regulations for aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. The mean recovery of three mycotoxins ranged from 82.9-112%, with a RSD less than 7.9% in all cases. The method was successfully applied to measure mycotoxins in commercial rice samples collected from local supermarkets in China.
24164515	Toxicological evaluation of proteins introduced into food crops.	2013	Crit Rev Toxicol	This manuscript focuses on the toxicological evaluation of proteins introduced into GM crops to impart desired traits. In many cases, introduced proteins can be shown to have a history of safe use. Where modifications have been made to proteins, experience has shown that it is highly unlikely that modification of amino acid sequences can make a non-toxic protein toxic. Moreover, if the modified protein still retains its biological function, and this function is found in related proteins that have a history of safe use (HOSU) in food, and the exposure level is similar to functionally related proteins, then the modified protein could also be considered to be "as-safe-as" those that have a HOSU. Within nature, there can be considerable evolutionary changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins within the same family, yet these proteins share the same biological function. In general, food crops such as maize, soy, rice, canola etc. are subjected to a variety of processing conditions to generate different food products. Processing conditions such as cooking, modification of pH conditions, and mechanical shearing can often denature proteins in these crops resulting in a loss of functional activity. These same processing conditions can also markedly lower human dietary exposure to (functionally active) proteins. Safety testing of an introduced protein could be indicated if its biological function was not adequately characterized and/or it was shown to be structurally/functionally related to proteins that are known to be toxic to mammals.
24278269	A physical map of the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A.	2013	PLoS One	Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has a large and highly repetitive genome which poses major technical challenges for its study. To aid map-based cloning and future genome sequencing projects, we constructed a BAC-based physical map of the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A (1AS). From the assembly of 25,918 high information content (HICF) fingerprints from a 1AS-specific BAC library, 715 physical contigs were produced that cover almost 99% of the estimated size of the chromosome arm. The 3,414 BAC clones constituting the minimum tiling path were end-sequenced. Using a gene microarray containing ∼40 K NCBI UniGene EST clusters, PCR marker screening and BAC end sequences, we arranged 160 physical contigs (97 Mb or 35.3% of the chromosome arm) in a virtual order based on synteny with Brachypodium, rice and sorghum. BAC end sequences and information from microarray hybridisation was used to anchor 3.8 Mbp of Illumina sequences from flow-sorted chromosome 1AS to BAC contigs. Comparison of genetic and synteny-based physical maps indicated that ∼50% of all genetic recombination is confined to 14% of the physical length of the chromosome arm in the distal region. The 1AS physical map provides a framework for future genetic mapping projects as well as the basis for complete sequencing of chromosome arm 1AS.
24188923	Co-composting of livestock manure with rice straw: characterization and establishment of maturity evaluation system.	2014	Waste Manag	Composting is considered to be a primary treatment method for livestock manure and rice straw, and high degree of maturity is a prerequisite for safe land application of the composting products. In this study pilot-scale experiments were carried out to characterize the co-composting process of livestock manure with rice straw, as well as to establish a maturity evaluation index system for the composts obtained. Two pilot composting piles with different feedstocks were conducted for 3 months: (1) swine manure and rice straw (SM-RS); and (2) dairy manure and rice straw (DM-RS). During the composting process, parameters including temperature, moisture, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), different forms of nitrogen (total, ammonia and nitrate), and humification index (humic acid and fulvic acid) were monitored in addition to germination index (GI), plant growth index (PGI) and Solvita maturity index. OM loss followed the first-order kinetic model in both piles, and a slightly faster OM mineralization was achieved in the SM-RS pile. Also, the SM-RS pile exhibited slightly better performance than the DM-RS according to the evolutions of temperature, OM degradation, GI and PGI. The C/N ratio, GI and PGI could be included in the maturity evaluation index system in which GI>120% and PGI>1.00 signal mature co-composts.
24209919	Computational evaluation on the binding affinity of non-specific lipid-transfer protein-2 with fatty acids.	2013	Comput Biol Med	A computational study was carried out to identify the structural determinant controlling the affinity, specificity and binding strength of several saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with Oryza sativa (Indica group) nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2). Association between the number, position and conformation of hydrophobic patches and lipid binding properties of the protein was evidenced by docking analysis. Binding affinity is influenced by the number of carbon atoms, location of double bonds and hydroxyl group in the acyl chain. The results may direct at developing applications in LTP-mediated transport and controlled release of low molecular weight drugs.
24240810	A review of microsatellite markers and their applications in rice breeding programs to improve blast disease resistance.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Over the last few decades, the use of molecular markers has played an increasing role in rice breeding and genetics. Of the different types of molecular markers, microsatellites have been utilized most extensively, because they can be readily amplified by PCR and the large amount of allelic variation at each locus. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSR), and they are typically composed of 1-6 nucleotide repeats. These markers are abundant, distributed throughout the genome and are highly polymorphic compared with other genetic markers, as well as being species-specific and co-dominant. For these reasons, they have become increasingly important genetic markers in rice breeding programs. The evolution of new biotypes of pests and diseases as well as the pressures of climate change pose serious challenges to rice breeders, who would like to increase rice production by introducing resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Recent advances in rice genomics have now made it possible to identify and map a number of genes through linkage to existing DNA markers. Among the more noteworthy examples of genes that have been tightly linked to molecular markers in rice are those that confer resistance or tolerance to blast. Therefore, in combination with conventional breeding approaches, marker-assisted selection (MAS) can be used to monitor the presence or lack of these genes in breeding populations. For example, marker-assisted backcross breeding has been used to integrate important genes with significant biological effects into a number of commonly grown rice varieties. The use of cost-effective, finely mapped microsatellite markers and MAS strategies should provide opportunities for breeders to develop high-yield, blast resistance rice cultivars. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the linkage of microsatellite markers to rice blast resistance genes, as well as to explore the use of MAS in rice breeding programs aimed at improving blast resistance in this species. We also discuss the various advantages, disadvantages and uses of microsatellite markers relative to other molecular marker types.
24260455	Urinary and dietary analysis of 18,470 bangladeshis reveal a correlation of rice consumption with arsenic exposure and toxicity.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: We utilized data from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Araihazar, Bangladesh, to evaluate the association of steamed rice consumption with urinary total arsenic concentration and arsenical skin lesions in the overall study cohort (N=18,470) and in a subset with available urinary arsenic metabolite data (N=4,517).

METHODS: General linear models with standardized beta coefficients were used to estimate associations between steamed rice consumption and urinary total arsenic concentration and urinary arsenic metabolites. Logistic regression models were used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between rice intake and prevalent skin lesions at baseline. Discrete time hazard models were used to estimate discrete time (HRs) ratios and their 95% CIs for the associations between rice intake and incident skin lesions.

RESULTS: Steamed rice consumption was positively associated with creatinine-adjusted urinary total arsenic (β=0.041, 95% CI: 0.032-0.051) and urinary total arsenic with statistical adjustment for creatinine in the model (β=0.043, 95% CI: 0.032-0.053). Additionally, we observed a significant trend in skin lesion prevalence (P-trend=0.007) and a moderate trend in skin lesion incidence (P-trend=0.07) associated with increased intake of steamed rice.

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that rice intake may be a source of arsenic exposure beyond drinking water.
24244501	Comparative genome analysis between Agrostis stolonifera and members of the Pooideae subfamily, including Brachypodium distachyon.	2013	PLoS One	Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera, allotetraploid 2n = 4x = 28) is one of the major cool-season turfgrasses. It is widely used on golf courses due to its tolerance to low mowing and aggressive growth habit. In this study, we investigated genome relationships of creeping bentgrass relative to the Triticeae (a consensus map of Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, Hordeum vulgare, and H. spontaneum), oat, rice, and ryegrass maps using a common set of 229 EST-RFLP markers. The genome comparisons based on the RFLP markers revealed large-scale chromosomal rearrangements on different numbers of linkage groups (LGs) of creeping bentgrass relative to the Triticeae (3 LGs), oat (4 LGs), and rice (8 LGs). However, we detected no chromosomal rearrangement between creeping bentgrass and ryegrass, suggesting that these recently domesticated species might be closely related, despite their memberships to different Pooideae tribes. In addition, the genome of creeping bentgrass was compared with the complete genome sequence of Brachypodium distachyon in Pooideae subfamily using both sequences of the above-mentioned mapped EST-RFLP markers and sequences of 8,470 publicly available A. stolonifera ESTs (AgEST). We discovered large-scale chromosomal rearrangements on six LGs of creeping bentgrass relative to B. distachyon. Also, a total of 24 syntenic blocks based on 678 orthologus loci were identified between these two grass species. The EST orthologs can be utilized in further comparative mapping of Pooideae species. These results will be useful for genetic improvement of Agrostis species and will provide a better understanding of evolution within Pooideae species.
24244529	Comparative transcriptome analysis of salivary glands of two populations of rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, that differ in virulence.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a destructive rice pest in Asia, can quickly overcome rice resistance by evolving new virulent populations. Herbivore saliva plays an important role in plant-herbivore interactions, including in plant defense and herbivore virulence. However, thus far little is known about BPH saliva at the molecular level, especially its role in virulence and BPH-rice interaction.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using cDNA amplification in combination with Illumina short-read sequencing technology, we sequenced the salivary-gland transcriptomes of two BPH populations with different virulence; the populations were derived from rice variety TN1 (TN1 population) and Mudgo (M population). In total, 37,666 and 38,451 unigenes were generated from the salivary glands of these populations, respectively. When combined, a total of 43,312 unigenes were obtained, about 18 times more than the number of expressed sequence tags previously identified from these glands. Gene ontology annotations and KEGG orthology classifications indicated that genes related to metabolism, binding and transport were significantly active in the salivary glands. A total of 352 genes were predicted to encode secretory proteins, and some might play important roles in BPH feeding and BPH-rice interactions. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of the two populations revealed that the genes related to 'metabolism,' 'digestion and absorption,' and 'salivary secretion' might be associated with virulence. Moreover, 67 genes encoding putative secreted proteins were differentially expressed between the two populations, suggesting these genes may contribute to the change in virulence.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study was the first to compare the salivary-gland transcriptomes of two BPH populations having different virulence traits and to find genes that may be related to this difference. Our data provide a rich molecular resource for future functional studies on salivary glands and will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying BPH feeding and virulence differences.
24244838	Phenotypic characters of rice landraces reveal independent lineages of short-grain aromatic indica rice.	2013	AoB Plants	Rice landraces are lineages developed by farmers through artificial selection during the long-term domestication process. Despite huge potential for crop improvement, they are largely understudied in India. Here, we analyse a suite of phenotypic characters from large numbers of Indian landraces comprised of both aromatic and non-aromatic varieties. Our primary aim was to investigate the major determinants of diversity, the strength of segregation among aromatic and non-aromatic landraces as well as that within aromatic landraces. Using principal component analysis, we found that grain length, width and weight, panicle weight and leaf length have the most substantial contribution. Discriminant analysis can effectively distinguish the majority of aromatic from non-aromatic landraces. More interestingly, within aromatic landraces long-grain traditional Basmati and short-grain non-Basmati aromatics remain morphologically well differentiated. The present research emphasizes the general patterns of phenotypic diversity and finds out the most important characters. It also confirms the existence of very unique short-grain aromatic landraces, perhaps carrying signatures of independent origin of an additional aroma quantitative trait locus in the indica group, unlike introgression of specific alleles of the BADH2 gene from the japonica group as in Basmati. We presume that this parallel origin and evolution of aroma in short-grain indica landraces are linked to the long history of rice domestication that involved inheritance of several traits from Oryza nivara, in addition to O. rufipogon. We conclude with a note that the insights from the phenotypic analysis essentially comprise the first part, which will likely be validated with subsequent molecular analysis.
24263095	Flood-tolerant rice reduces yield variability and raises expected yield, differentially benefitting socially disadvantaged groups.	2013	Sci Rep	Approximately 30% of the cultivated rice area in India is prone to crop damage from prolonged flooding. We use a randomized field experiment in 128 villages of Orissa India to show that Swarna-Sub1, a recently released submergence-tolerant rice variety, has significant positive impacts on rice yield when fields are submerged for 7 to 14 days with no yield penalty without flooding. We estimate that Swarna-Sub1 offers an approximate 45% increase in yields over the current popular variety when fields are submerged for 10 days. We show additionally that low-lying areas prone to flooding tend to be more heavily occupied by people belonging to lower caste social groups. Thus, a policy relevant implication of our findings is that flood-tolerant rice can deliver both efficiency gains, through reduced yield variability and higher expected yield, and equity gains in disproportionately benefiting the most marginal group of farmers.
23927717	Impacts of palatal coverage on bolus formation during mastication and swallowing and subsequent adaptive changes.	2013	J Oral Rehabil	Palatal coverage is often required for elderly edentulous patients with complete dentures. The purpose of this study was to clarify impacts of palatal coverage on bolus formation and subsequent adaptive changes. Subjects were 18 healthy young dentulous adults who wore 1·5-mm-thick palatal plates. Subjects were asked to feed 12 g of bicoloured rice as usual, and the bolus formation by mastication and swallowing in the pharynx was observed using a nasal videoendoscopy. The bolus formation index (BFI), number of mastication strokes until swallowing, visual analogue scale about swallowing easiness and masticatory performance using colour-changeable gum were measured under three conditions: before placement of the palatal plate (day 0), immediately after placement (day 1) and after 7 days of wearing the plate (day 7). BFI and visual analogue scale on day 1 were significantly lower than those on day 0, but those on day 7 significantly recovered to the level of day 0. The number of mastication strokes did not change from day 0 to day 1, however, that on day 7 was significantly higher. Masticatory performance on days 1 and 7 was significantly lower than that on day 0. Although palatal coverage inhibits bolus formation during feeding, subjects increased the number of mastication strokes until swallowing threshold as they adapted to palatal coverage over time. This adaptive change was due to compensate for the lowered masticatory performance to achieve bolus formation for comfortable swallowing.
23936527	Circadian rhythms of sense and antisense transcription in sugarcane, a highly polyploid crop.	2013	PLoS One	Commercial sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid) is a highly polyploid and aneuploid grass that stores large amounts of sucrose in its stem. We have measured circadian rhythms of sense and antisense transcription in a commercial cultivar (RB855453) using a custom oligoarray with 14,521 probes that hybridize to sense transcripts (SS) and 7,380 probes that hybridize to antisense transcripts (AS).We estimated that 32% of SS probes and 22% AS probes were rhythmic. This is a higher proportion of rhythmic probes than the usually found in similar experiments in other plant species. Orthologs and inparalogs of Arabidopsis thaliana, sugarcane, rice, maize and sorghum were grouped in ortholog clusters. When ortholog clusters were used to compare probes among different datasets, sugarcane also showed a higher proportion of rhythmic elements than the other species. Thus, it is possible that a higher proportion of transcripts are regulated by the sugarcane circadian clock. Thirty-six percent of the identified AS/SS pairs had significant correlated time courses and 64% had uncorrelated expression patterns. The clustering of transcripts with similar function, the anticipation of daily environmental changes and the temporal compartmentation of metabolic processes were some properties identified in the circadian sugarcane transcriptome. During the day, there was a dominance of transcripts associated with photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, including sucrose and starch synthesis. During the night, there was dominance of transcripts associated with genetic processing, such as histone regulation and RNA polymerase, ribosome and protein synthesis. Finally, the circadian clock also regulated hormone signalling pathways: a large proportion of auxin and ABA signalling components were regulated by the circadian clock in an unusual biphasic distribution.
23940651	Syntenic relationships between the U and M genomes of Aegilops, wheat and the model species Brachypodium and rice as revealed by COS markers.	2013	PLoS One	Diploid Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata are important wild gene sources for wheat. With the aim of assisting in alien gene transfer, this study provides gene-based conserved orthologous set (COS) markers for the U and M genome chromosomes. Out of the 140 markers tested on a series of wheat-Aegilops chromosome introgression lines and flow-sorted subgenomic chromosome fractions, 100 were assigned to Aegilops chromosomes and six and seven duplications were identified in the U and M genomes, respectively. The marker-specific EST sequences were BLAST-ed to Brachypodium and rice genomic sequences to investigate macrosyntenic relationships between the U and M genomes of Aegilops, wheat and the model species. Five syntenic regions of Brachypodium identified genome rearrangements differentiating the U genome from the M genome and from the D genome of wheat. All of them seem to have evolved at the diploid level and to have been modified differentially in the polyploid species Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. A certain level of wheat-Aegilops homology was detected for group 1, 2, 3 and 5 chromosomes, while a clearly rearranged structure was showed for the group 4, 6 and 7 Aegilops chromosomes relative to wheat. The conserved orthologous set markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes promise to accelerate gene introgression by facilitating the identification of alien chromatin. The syntenic relationships between the Aegilops species, wheat and model species will facilitate the targeted development of new markers specific for U and M genomic regions and will contribute to the understanding of molecular processes related to allopolyploidization.
23688619	Expression patterns of photoperiod and temperature regulated heading date genes in Oryza sativa.	2013	Comput Biol Chem	In plants, flowering is a major biological phenomenon, which is regulated by an array of interactions occurring between biotic and abiotic factors. In our study, we have compared the expression profiles of flowering genes involved in the flowering pathway, which are influenced by conditions like photoperiod and temperature from seedling to heading developmental stages in two Oryza sativa indica varieties, viz., Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 using a expression network approach. Using the network expression approach, we found 17 co-expressed genes having the same expression profile pattern as three key photoperiod flowering genes Hd1, Ehd1 and Hd3a. We also demonstrated that these three co-expressed genes have a similar simulation pattern as temperature flowering genes. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that photoperiod and temperature regulate flowering pathways independently. The present study provides a basis for understanding the network of co-expressed genes involved in flowering pathway and presents a way to demonstrate the behavior of specific gene sets in specific cultivars.
23929654	Functional delineation of rice MADS29 reveals its role in embryo and endosperm development by affecting hormone homeostasis.	2013	J Exp Bot	Rice MADS29 has recently been reported to cause programmed cell death of maternal tissues, the nucellus, and the nucellar projection during early stages of seed development. However, analyses involving OsMADS29 protein expression domains and characterization of OsMADS29 gain-of-function and knockdown phenotypes revealed novel aspects of its function in maintaining hormone homeostasis, which may have a role in the development of embryo and plastid differentiation and starch filling in endosperm cells. The MADS29 transcripts accumulated to high levels soon after fertilization; however, protein accumulation was found to be delayed by at least 4 days. Immunolocalization studies revealed that the protein accumulated initially in the dorsal-vascular trace and the outer layers of endosperm, and subsequently in the embryo and aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm. Ectopic expression of MADS29 resulted in a severely dwarfed phenotype, exhibiting elevated levels of cytokinin, thereby suggesting that cytokinin biosynthesis pathway could be one of the major targets of OsMADS29. Overexpression of OsMADS29 in heterologous BY2 cells was found to mimic the effects of exogenous application of cytokinins that causes differentiation of proplastids to starch-containing amyloplasts and activation of genes involved in the starch biosynthesis pathway. Suppression of MADS29 expression by RNAi severely affected seed set. The surviving seeds were smaller in size, with developmental abnormalities in the embryo and reduced size of endosperm cells, which also contained loosely packed starch granules. Microarray analysis of overexpression and knockdown lines exhibited altered expression of genes involved in plastid biogenesis, starch biosynthesis, cytokinin signalling and biosynthesis.
23918962	The effects of free-air CO₂ enrichment (FACE) on carbon and nitrogen accumulation in grains of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	J Exp Bot	Rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations will probably increase rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield but decrease grain nitrogen (GN) concentration. Grains attached to different positions in the panicles differ greatly in weight and quality, but their responses to elevated CO₂ (e[CO₂]) are poorly understood, which limits our understanding of the mechanisms of yield enhancement and quality degradation. Thus a free-air CO₂ enrichment experiment was conducted to examine the effects of e[CO₂] on grain mass (GM), grain carbon (GC), and GN accumulation in the spikelets attached to the upper primary rachis branch (superior spikelets; SS) and those attached to the lower secondary rachis (inferior spikelets; IS). e[CO₂] stimulated the rice yield by 13% but decreased the N concentration in the panicle by 7% when averaged over two levels of N fertilizations (P < 0.01). The responses of SS and IS to e[CO₂] were different particularly under higher N supply. For SS, e[CO₂] decreased GN by 24% (P < 0.01) but did not affect GM. For IS, e[CO₂] increased GM by 13% (P < 0.05) but GN was not affected. The reduction of GN due to e[CO₂] started to appear at the beginning of grain filling. These results suggest that future [CO₂] levels probably stimulate the grain growth of IS, most of which are not marketable due to limited size, at the expense of GN reduction in SS. Translocation of N from SS to IS may be a possible mechanism for reduction in GN of SS. This may degrade the grain quality of marketable rice under e[CO₂].
23934674	Fuzzy Filtering With Randomly Occurring Parameter Uncertainties, Interval Delays, and Channel Fadings.	2014	IEEE Trans Cybern	In this paper, the H∞ fuzzy filtering problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with randomly occurring uncertainties and randomly occurring interval time-varying delays, as well as channel fadings. A sequence of random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution is utilized to govern the randomly occurring uncertainties and probabilistic interval time-varying delays. Simultaneously, the Rice fading model is employed to describe the phenomena of channel fadings by setting different values of the channel coefficients. Our attention is focused on the design of an H∞ fuzzy filter such that the filtering error dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable and the disturbance rejection attenuation is constrained to a given level by means of the H∞-performance index. In the presence of the randomly occurring phenomena, sufficient conditions are derived, via stochastic analysis and Lyapunov functional approach, for the existence of desired filter ensuring both the exponential mean-square stability and the prescribed H∞ performance. The filter parameters can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem via the semidefinite program method. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed design technique.
23966593	Analysis of the early-flowering mechanisms and generation of T-DNA tagging lines in Kitaake, a model rice cultivar.	2013	J Exp Bot	As an extremely early flowering cultivar, rice cultivar Kitaake is a suitable model system for molecular studies. Expression analyses revealed that transcript levels of the flowering repressor Ghd7 were decreased while those of its downstream genes, Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1, were increased. Sequencing the known flowering-regulator genes revealed mutations in Ghd7 and OsPRR37 that cause early translation termination and amino acid substitutions, respectively. Genetic analysis of F2 progeny from a cross between cv. Kitaake and cv. Dongjin indicated that those mutations additively contribute to the early-flowering phenotype in cv. Kitaake. Because the short life cycle facilitates genetics research, this study generated 10 000 T-DNA tagging lines and deduced 6758 flanking sequence tags (FSTs), in which 3122 were genic and 3636 were intergenic. Among the genic lines, 367 (11.8%) were inserted into new genes that were not previously tagged. Because the lines were generated by T-DNA that contained the promoterless GUS reporter gene, which had an intron with triple splicing donors/acceptors in the right border region, a high efficiency of GUS expression was shown in various organs. Sequencing of the GUS-positive lines demonstrated that the third splicing donor and the first splicing acceptor of the vector were extensively used. The FST data have now been released into the public domain for seed distribution and facilitation of rice research.
23951332	Characterisation and analysis of the Aegilops sharonensis transcriptome, a wild relative of wheat in the Sitopsis section.	2013	PLoS One	Aegilops sharonensis Eig (Sharon goatgrass) is a wild diploid relative of wheat within the Sitopsis section of Aegilops. This species represents an untapped reservoir of genetic diversity for traits of agronomic importance, especially as a source of novel disease resistance. To gain a foothold in this genetic resource, we sequenced the cDNA from leaf tissue of two geographically distinct Ae. sharonensis accessions (1644 and 2232) using the 454 Life Sciences platform. We compared the results of two different assembly programs using different parameter sets to generate 13 distinct assemblies in an attempt to maximize representation of the gene space in de novo transcriptome assembly. The most sensitive assembly (71,029 contigs; N50 674 nts) retrieved 18,684 unique best reciprocal BLAST hits (BRBH) against six previously characterised grass proteomes while the most specific assembly (30,609 contigs; N50 815 nts) retrieved 15,687 BRBH. We combined these two assemblies into a set of 62,243 non-redundant sequences and identified 139 belonging to plant disease resistance genes of the nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat class. Based on the non-redundant sequences, we predicted 37,743 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), equivalent to one per 1,142 bp. We estimated the level of heterozygosity as 1.6% in accession 1644 and 30.1% in 2232. The Ae. sharonensis leaf transcriptome provides a rich source of sequence and SNPs for this wild wheat relative. These sequences can be used with existing monocot genome sequences and EST sequence collections (e.g. barley, Brachypodium, wheat, rice, maize and Sorghum) to assist with genetic and physical mapping and candidate gene identification in Ae. sharonensis. These resources provide an initial framework to further build on and characterise the genetic and genomic structure of Ae. sharonensis.
23953845	Dietary patterns and functional disability in older Korean adults.	2013	Maturitas	OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between dietary patterns and disability in the Korean elderly.

STUDY DESIGN: We used data from a cross-sectional study of 327 men and 460 women aged ≥65 years who completed the 2005 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A single 24-h dietary recall method was used to assess dietary intake and dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis. Functional disability was assessed by the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) scales. The association of dietary patterns with ADL and IADL disability was analyzed by logistic regression adjusting for age, marital status, education, household income, region, chronic conditions, body mass index, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and energy intake.

RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were identified in both men and women: the modified traditional dietary pattern, characterized by a relatively lower consumption of white rice, but higher consumption of fruits, dairy products, and legumes, and the traditional dietary pattern, characterized by high consumption of white rice. After controlling for covariates, in men, those who engaged in modified traditional dietary pattern, compared with traditional dietary pattern, showed a lower likelihood of ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]=0.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-0.56). In women, the modified traditional dietary pattern compared with the traditional pattern was associated with a significantly decreased risk of ADL (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.90) and IADL disability (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.28-0.72).

CONCLUSIONS: The modified traditional dietary pattern is associated with a decreased risk of functional disability in older Korean adults.
23966349	Simulating greenhouse gas mitigation potentials for Chinese Croplands using the DAYCENT ecosystem model.	2014	Glob Chang Biol	Understanding the potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in agricultural lands is a critical challenge for climate change policy. This study uses the DAYCENT ecosystem model to predict GHG mitigation potentials associated with soil management in Chinese cropland systems. Application of ecosystem models, such as DAYCENT, requires the evaluation of model performance with data sets from experiments relevant to the climate and management of the study region. DAYCENT was evaluated with data from 350 cropland experiments in China, including measurements of nitrous oxide emissions (N2 O), methane emissions (CH4 ), and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes. In general, the model was reasonably accurate with R(2) values for model predictions vs. measurements ranging from 0.71 to 0.85. Modeling efficiency varied from 0.65 for SOC stock changes to 0.83 for crop yields. Mitigation potentials were estimated on a yield basis (Mg CO2 -equivalent Mg(-1) Yield). The results demonstrate that the largest decrease in GHG emissions in rainfed systems are associated with combined effect of reducing mineral N fertilization, organic matter amendments and reduced-till coupled with straw return, estimated at 0.31 to 0.83 Mg CO2 -equivalent Mg(-1) Yield. A mitigation potential of 0.08 to 0.36 Mg CO2 -equivalent Mg(-1) Yield is possible by reducing N chemical fertilizer rates, along with intermittent flooding in paddy rice cropping systems.
23904260	Prevalence of genetically modified rice, maize, and soy in Saudi food products.	2013	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Qualitative and quantitative DNA-based methods were applied to detect genetically modified foods in samples from markets in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Two hundred samples were collected from Al-Qassim, Riyadh, and Mahdina in 2009 and 2010. GMOScreen 35S and NOS test kits for the detection of genetically modified organism varieties in samples were used. The positive results obtained from GMOScreen 35S and NOS were identified using specific primer pairs. The results indicated that all rice samples gave negative results for the presence of 35S and NOS terminator. About 26 % of samples containing soybean were positive for 35S and NOS terminator and 44 % of samples containing maize were positive for the presence of 35S and/or NOS terminator. The results showed that 20.4 % of samples was positive for maize line Bt176, 8.8 % was positive for maize line Bt11, 8.8 % was positive for maize line T25, 5.9 % was positive for maize line MON 810, and 5.9 % was positive for StarLink maize. Twelve samples were shown to contain <3 % of genetically modified (GM) soy and 6 samples >10 % of GM soy. Four samples containing GM maize were shown to contain >5 % of GM maize MON 810. Four samples containing GM maize were shown to contain >1 % of StarLink maize. Establishing strong regulations and certified laboratories to monitor GM foods or crops in Saudi market is recommended.
23916648	Interaction between amylose and 1-butanol during 1-butanol-hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of normal rice starch.	2013	Int J Biol Macromol	The aim of this study was to examine the interaction between amylose and 1-butanol during the 1-butanol-hydrochloric acid (1-butanol-HCl) hydrolysis of normal rice starch. The interaction model between amylose and 1-butanol was proposed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (13)C cross polarization and magic angle spinning NMR analysis ((13)C CP/MAS NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA). GC-MS data showed that another form of 1-butanol existed in 1-butanol-HCl-hydrolyzed normal rice starch, except in the form of free molecules absorbed on the starch granules. The signal of 1-butanol-HCl-hydrolyzed starch at 100.1 ppm appeared in the (13)C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, indicating that the amylose-1-butanol complex was formed. DSC and TGA data also demonstrated the formation of the complex, which significantly affected the thermal properties of normal rice starch. These findings revealed that less dextrin with low molecular weight formed might be attributed to resistance of this complex to acid during 1-butanol-HCl hydrolysis.
24280112	Insights into genomics of salt stress response in rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	Plants, as sessile organisms experience various abiotic stresses, which pose serious threat to crop production. Plants adapt to environmental stress by modulating their growth and development along with the various physiological and biochemical changes. This phenotypic plasticity is driven by the activation of specific genes encoding signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, ion transporters and metabolic pathways. Rice is an important staple food crop of nearly half of the world population and is well known to be a salt sensitive crop. The completion and enhanced annotations of rice genome sequence has provided the opportunity to study functional genomics of rice. Functional genomics aids in understanding the molecular and physiological basis to improve the salinity tolerance for sustainable rice production. Salt tolerant transgenic rice plants have been produced by incorporating various genes into rice. In this review we present the findings and investigations in the field of rice functional genomics that includes supporting genes and networks (ABA dependent and independent), osmoprotectants (proline, glycine betaine, trehalose, myo-inositol, and fructans), signaling molecules (Ca2+, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, brassinosteroids) and transporters, regulating salt stress response in rice.
24095838	Auxin distribution is differentially affected by nitrate in roots of two rice cultivars differing in responsiveness to nitrogen.	2013	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although ammonium (NH4(+)) is the preferred form of nitrogen over nitrate (NO3(-)) for rice (Oryza sativa), lateral root (LR) growth in roots is enhanced by partial NO3(-) nutrition (PNN). The roles of auxin distribution and polar transport in LR formation in response to localized NO3(-) availability are not known.

METHODS: Time-course studies in a split-root experimental system were used to investigate LR development patterns, auxin distribution, polar auxin transport and expression of auxin transporter genes in LR zones in response to localized PNN in 'Nanguang' and 'Elio' rice cultivars, which show high and low responsiveness to NO3(-), respectively. Patterns of auxin distribution and the effects of polar auxin transport inhibitors were also examined in DR5::GUS transgenic plants.

KEY RESULTS: Initiation of LRs was enhanced by PNN after 7 d cultivation in 'Nanguang' but not in 'Elio'. Auxin concentration in the roots of 'Nanguang' increased by approx. 24 % after 5 d cultivation with PNN compared with NH4(+) as the sole nitrogen source, but no difference was observed in 'Elio'. More auxin flux into the LR zone in 'Nanguang' roots was observed in response to NO3(-) compared with NH4(+) treatment. A greater number of auxin influx and efflux transporter genes showed increased expression in the LR zone in response to PNN in 'Nanguang' than in 'Elio'.

CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that higher NO3(-) responsiveness is associated with greater auxin accumulation in the LR zone and is strongly related to a higher rate of LR initiation in the cultivar 'Nanguang'.
24158434	Whole grain and refined grain consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies.	2013	Eur J Epidemiol	Several studies have suggested a protective effect of intake of whole grains, but not refined grains on type 2 diabetes risk, but the dose-response relationship between different types of grains and type 2 diabetes has not been established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of grain intake and type 2 diabetes. We searched the PubMed database for studies of grain intake and risk of type 2 diabetes, up to June 5th, 2013. Summary relative risks were calculated using a random effects model. Sixteen cohort studies were included in the analyses. The summary relative risk per 3 servings per day was 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-0.81, I(2) = 82%, n = 10) for whole grains and 0.95 (95% CI 0.88-1.04, I(2) = 53%, n = 6) for refined grains. A nonlinear association was observed for whole grains, p nonlinearity < 0.0001, but not for refined grains, p nonlinearity = 0.10. Inverse associations were observed for subtypes of whole grains including whole grain bread, whole grain cereals, wheat bran and brown rice, but these results were based on few studies, while white rice was associated with increased risk. Our meta-analysis suggests that a high whole grain intake, but not refined grains, is associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk. However, a positive association with intake of white rice and inverse associations between several specific types of whole grains and type 2 diabetes warrant further investigations. Our results support public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains and suggest that at least two servings of whole grains per day should be consumed to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.

24165682	Do transgenesis and marker-assisted backcross breeding produce substantially equivalent plants? A comparative study of transgenic and backcross rice carrying bacterial blight resistant gene Xa21.	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The potential impact of genetically modified (GM) plants on human health has attracted much attention worldwide, and the issue remains controversial. This is in sharp contrast to the broad acceptance of plants produced by breeding through Marker Assisted Backcrossing (MAB).

RESULTS: Focusing on transcriptome variation and perturbation to signaling pathways, we assessed the molecular and biological aspects of substantial equivalence, a general principle for food safety endorsed by the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization, between a transgenic crop and a plant from MAB breeding. We compared a transgenic rice line (DXT) and a MAB rice line (DXB), both of which contain the gene Xa21 providing resistance to bacterial leaf blight. By using Next-Generation sequencing data of DXT, DXB and their parental line (D62B), we compared the transcriptome variation of DXT and DXB. Remarkably, DXT had 43% fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than DXB. The genes exclusively expressed in DXT and in DXB have pathogen and stress defense functions. Functional categories of DEGs in DXT were comparable to that in DXB, and seven of the eleven pathways significantly affected by transgenesis were also perturbed by MAB breeding.

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the transgenic rice and rice from MAB breeding are substantial equivalent at the transcriptome level, and paved a way for further study of transgenic rice, e.g., understanding the chemical and nutritional properties of the DEGs identified in the current study.
24056583	Black rice and anthocyanins induce inhibition of cholesterol absorption in vitro.	2013	Food Funct	Black rice (Oryza sativa L.) is often associated with blood lipid control. This study systematically assessed the inhibition of cholesterol absorption in vitro by black rice and explored cholesterol-lowering compounds present in this rice. Our results indicated that black rice extracts (BRE), which were aqueous, ethanol extracts and a fraction of macroporous resin caused the reduction of cholesterol absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, decreasing the micellar cholesterol solubility and suppressing cholesterol uptake in Caco-2 cells. The inhibitory activity was positively associated with anthocyanin (cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and peonidin-3-glucoside (Pn-3-G)) contents of the extracts. Therefore, the cholesterol absorption inhibiting properties of anthocyanins were further explored. The IC50 values of Cy-3-G and Pn-3-G against pancreatic lipase were 42.53 ± 4.45 and 18.13 ± 4.22 μg mL(-1), respectively. Kinetic analysis suggested that the enzymatic inhibitory mode of Cy-3-G and Pn-3-G belonged to the competitive type. In mixed micelles, Cy-3-G and Pn-3-G dose dependently reduced the solubility of cholesterol. Meanwhile, a potential mechanism of cholesterol reduction by anthocyanins was investigated. Results showed that anthocyanins led to precipitation of cholesterol from micellar solution, which may induce the reduction of cholesterol. In Caco-2 cells, Cy-3-G and Pn-3-G (40 μg mL(-1)) exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake, and the degree of this reduction was almost the same as that observed in the group treated with Ezetimibe at the same concentration. These findings provide important evidence that anthocyanins may partly contribute to the inhibitory effects of black rice on cholesterol absorption, and thus may be applied for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.
24141028	Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 increases Arabidopsis resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and rice resistance against Magnaporthe grisea.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are crucial calcium sensors involved in plant responses to pathogen infection. Here, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice OsCPK10 gene. The expression of OsCPK10 was strongly induced following treatment with a Magnaporthe grisea elicitor. Kinase activity assay showed that the functional OsCPK10 protein not only autophosphorylated, but also phosphorylated Casein in a calcium-dependent manner. Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 in Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, associated with elevated expression of both SA- and JA-related defense genes. Similarly, transgenic rice plants containing constitutively active OsCPK10 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast fungus M. grisea. The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines was associated with activated expression of SA- and JA-related defense genes. Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA- and JA-dependent defense responses.
24137159	Life cycle of phytoreoviruses visualized by electron microscopy and tomography.	2013	Front Microbiol	Rice dwarf virus and Rice gall dwarf virus, members of the genus Phytoreovirus in the family Reoviridae,are known as agents of rice disease, because their spread results in substantial economic damage in many Asian countries. These viruses are transmitted via insect vectors, and they multiply both in the plants and in the insect vectors. Structural information about the viruses and their interactions with cellular components in the life cycle are essential for understanding viral infection and replication mechanisms. The life cycle of the viruses involves various cellular events such as cell entry, synthesis of viral genome and proteins, assembly of viral components, viral egress from infected cells, and intra- and intercellular transports. This review focuses on the major events underlying the life cycle of phytoreoviruses, which has been visualized by various electron microscopy (EM) imaging techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy and tomography, and demonstrates the advantage of the advanced EM imaging techniques to investigate the viral infection and replication mechanisms.
24100624	Gibberellin production by newly isolated strain Leifsonia soli SE134 and its potential to promote plant growth.	2014	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Very few plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to produce gibberellins (GAs). The current study aimed to isolate a phytohormone-producing PGP rhizobacterium from soil and assess its potential to enhance plant growth. The newly isolated bacterium was identified as Leifsonia soli sp. SE134 on the basis of partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence. Application of L. soli culture filtrate significantly increased the biomass, hypocotyl, and root lengths of cucumber seeds as compared with non-inoculated sole medium and distilled water treated controls. Furthermore, the PGPR culture was applied to the GA-deficient mutant rice cultivar Waito-C. Treatment with L. soli SE134 significantly increased the growth of Waito-C rice seedlings as compared with controls. Upon chromatographic analysis of L. soli culture, we isolated, detected and quantified different GAs; namely, GA1 (0.61 ± 0.15), GA4 (1.58 ± 0.26), GA7 (0.54 ± 0.18), GA8 (0.98 ± 0.15), GA9 (0.45 ± 0.17), GA12 (0.64 ± 0.21), GA19 (0.18 ± 0.09), GA20 (0.78 ± 0.15), GA24 (0.38 ± 0.09), GA34 (0.35 ± 0.10), and GA53 (0.17 ± 0.05). Plant growth promotion in cucumber, tomato, and young radish plants further evidenced the potential of this strain as a PGP bacterium. The results suggest that GA secretion by L. soli SE134 might prove advantageous for its ameliorative role in crop growth. These findings can be extended for improving the productivity of different crops under diverse environmental conditions.

24101210	Multi-year monitoring of paddy rice planting area in Northeast China using MODIS time series data.	2013	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	The objective of this study was to investigate the tempo-spatial distribution of paddy rice in Northeast China using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We developed an algorithm for detection and estimation of the transplanting and flooding periods of paddy rice with a combination of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface water index with a central wavelength at 2130 nm (LSWI2130). In two intensive sites in Northeast China, fine resolution satellite imagery was used to validate the performance of the algorithm at pixel and 3×3 pixel window levels, respectively. The commission and omission errors in both of the intensive sites were approximately less than 20%. Based on the algorithm, annual distribution of paddy rice in Northeast China from 2001 to 2009 was mapped and analyzed. The results demonstrated that the MODIS-derived area was highly correlated with published agricultural statistical data with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) value of 0.847. It also revealed a sharp decline in 2003, especially in the Sanjiang Plain located in the northeast of Heilongjiang Province, due to the oversupply and price decline of rice in 2002. These results suggest that the approaches are available for accurate and reliable monitoring of rice cultivated areas and variation on a large scale.
24021435	Evaluation of sugar content and composition in commonly consumed Korean vegetables, fruits, cereals, seed plants, and leaves by HPLC-ELSD.	2013	Carbohydr Res	In the present investigation, evaluation of sugars viz. fructose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and raffinose in commonly consumed raw Korean vegetables, fruits, cereals, seed plants, and leaves has been analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD). Of the 58 samples analyzed, Onion showed the highest content of fructose (27.74g/100g) and glucose (31.80g/100g) and Chestnuts showed the highest content of sucrose (21.82g/100g). On the other hand, Glutinous sorghum (polished grain), Green tea leaves, and Paddy rice (well-polished rice) showed the lowest content of fructose (0.20g/100g), glucose (0.68g/100g) and sucrose (0.23g/100g), respectively. Glutinous barley (Hopimbori-whole grain) and Green tea leaves showed 0.17g/100g and 0.57g/100g of galactose and lactose respectively. Glutinous barley (Seodunchalbori-polished grain) and Black soybeans (Cheongjaho, dried) showed the highest content of maltose (0.51g/100g) and raffinose (1.82g/100g), respectively. In few samples, galactose, maltose, lactose, and raffinose were detected in trace quantities. A partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was also performed to discriminate the analyzed samples.
24105436	Genetic mapping of sterile genes with epistasis in backcross designs.	2014	Heredity (Edinb)	The mapping of sterile genes is an essential issue, which should be solved for the investigation of sterility mechanism in wide hybridization of plants. However, the methods formerly developed cannot address the problem of mapping sterile loci with epistasis. In this study, we developed a new method to map sterile genes with epistasis in wide hybridizations of plants using a backcross design. The maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters of recombination fractions and effects of sterile genes, and the convergent results of these parameters were obtained using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The application and efficiency of this method were tested and demonstrated by a set of simulated data and real data analysis. Results from the simulation experiments showed that the method works well for simultaneously estimating the positions and effects of sterile genes, as well as the epistasis between sterile genes. A real data set of a backcross (BC) population from an interspecific hybrid between cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and its wild African relative, Oryza longistaminata, was analyzed using the new method. Five sterile genes were detected on the chromosomes of 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, and significant epistatic effects were found among the four pairs of sterile genes.
24122336	Oxidative stress management in the filamentous, heterocystous, diazotrophic cyanobacterium, Anabaena PCC7120.	2013	Photosynth Res	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are inevitably generated as by-products of respiratory/photosynthetic electron transport in oxygenic photoautotrophs. Unless effectively scavenged, these ROS can damage all cellular components. The filamentous, heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing strains of the cyanobacterium, Anabaena, serve as naturally abundant contributors of nitrogen biofertilizers in tropical rice paddy fields. Anabaena strains are known to tolerate several abiotic stresses, such as heat, UV, gamma radiation, desiccation, etc., that are known to generate ROS. ROS are detoxified by specific antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases and peroxiredoxins. The genome of Anabaena PCC7120 encodes two SODs, two catalases and seven peroxiredoxins, indicating the presence of an elaborate antioxidant enzymatic machinery to defend its cellular components from ROS. This article summarizes recent findings and depicts important perspectives in oxidative stress management in Anabaena PCC7120.
24054657	Magnetic multi-wall carbon nanotube nanocomposite as an adsorbent for preconcentration and determination of lead (II) and manganese (II) in various matrices.	2013	Talanta	Magnetic multi-wall carbon nanotube (MMWCNT) nanocomposite was synthesized and used as an adsorbent for preconcentration and determination of lead (II) and manganese (II). The properties of MMWCNT were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR). This adsorbent was found to be advantageous over conventional solid phase extraction (SPE) in terms of operational simplicity and low time-consuming. MMWCNT, carrying target metals, was easily separated from the aqueous solutions with the help of an external magnet; so, no filtration or centrifugation was necessary. After extraction and collection of MMWCNT, the adsorbed analytes were eluted and analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of different sorption/desorption parameters. Under the optimized conditions, detection limits and enhancement factors of the proposed method for Pb and Mn were 1.0 and 0.6 µg L(-1), 390 and 697 respectively. The presented procedure was successfully applied for determination of Pb(II) and Mn (II) contents in lipstick, rice samples and accuracy was evaluated analyzing a certified reference material Seronorm(™) Urine LOT NO2525.
23754555	Insecticide susceptibilities in populations of two rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera, immigrating into Japan in the period 2005-2012.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens and the whitebacked planthopper Sogatella furcifera are both important pests on rice throughout Asia. The major cause of recent outbreaks is thought to be the development of insecticide resistance. Thus, the authors monitored insecticide susceptibilities in populations of these two insects immigrating into Japan in the period 2005-2012. Ten insecticides were tested, including members of the organophosphate, carbamate, pyrethroid, neonicotinoid and phenylpyrazole groups.

RESULTS: The LD50 values of N. lugens against imidacloprid increased from 2005 (0.7 µg g(-1)) to 2012 (98.5 µg g(-1)). The resistance ratio (LD50 value in 2012/baseline LD50 value in 1992) was 615.5. In contrast, LD50 values of N. lugens against fipronil were <1.0 µg g(-1) up to 2012, suggesting that N. lugens had developed no insecticide resistance to this insecticide. However, S. furcifera exhibited resistance against fipronil up to 2012. Except for the case of malathion, the resistances of N. lugens against members of the organophosphate and carbamate groups were closely similar in the period 2005-2012 to earlier determinations in 1984 and 1985.

CONCLUSION: Species-specific insecticide resistance (imidacloprid resistance in N. lugens and fipronil resistance in S. furcifera) is ongoing in populations of the two planthoppers immigrating into Japan.
23805325	Development of eSSR-Markers in Setaria italica and Their Applicability in Studying Genetic Diversity, Cross-Transferability and Comparative Mapping in Millet and Non-Millet Species.	2013	PLoS One	Foxtail millet (Setariaitalica L.) is a tractable experimental model crop for studying functional genomics of millets and bioenergy grasses. But the limited availability of genomic resources, particularly expressed sequence-based genic markers is significantly impeding its genetic improvement. Considering this, we attempted to develop EST-derived-SSR (eSSR) markers and utilize them in germplasm characterization, cross-genera transferability and in silico comparative mapping. From 66,027 foxtail millet EST sequences 24,828 non-redundant ESTs were deduced, representing ~16 Mb, which revealed 534 (~2%) eSSRs in 495 SSR containing ESTs at a frequency of 1/30 kb. A total of 447 pp were successfully designed, of which 327 were mapped physically onto nine chromosomes. About 106 selected primer pairs representing the foxtail millet genome showed high-level of cross-genera amplification at an average of ~88% in eight millets and four non-millet species. Broad range of genetic diversity (0.02-0.65) obtained in constructed phylogenetic tree using 40 eSSR markers demonstrated its utility in germplasm characterizations and phylogenetics. Comparative mapping of physically mapped eSSR markers showed considerable proportion of sequence-based orthology and syntenic relationship between foxtail millet chromosomes and sorghum (~68%), maize (~61%) and rice (~42%) chromosomes. Synteny analysis of eSSRs of foxtail millet, rice, maize and sorghum suggested the nested chromosome fusion frequently observed in grass genomes. Thus, for the first time we had generated large-scale eSSR markers in foxtail millet and demonstrated their utility in germplasm characterization, transferability, phylogenetics and comparative mapping studies in millets and bioenergy grass species.
23810819	Total arsenic, inorganic arsenic, and other elements concentrations in Italian rice grain varies with origin and type.	2013	Environ Pollut	Rice is comparatively efficient at assimilating inorganic arsenic (Asi), a class-one, non-threshold carcinogen, into its grain, being the dominant source of this element to mankind. Here it was investigated how the total arsenic (Ast) and Asi content of Italian rice grain sourced from market outlets varied by geographical origin and type. Total Cr, Cd Se, Mg, K, Zn, Ni were also quantified. Ast concentration on a variety basis ranged from means of 0.18 mg kg(-1) to 0.28 mg kg(-1), and from 0.11 mg kg(-1) to 0.28 mg kg(-1) by production region. For Asi concentration, means ranged from 0.08 mg kg(-1) to 0.11 mg kg(-1) by variety and 0.10 mg kg(-1) to 0.06 mg kg(-1) by region. There was significant geographical variation for both Ast and Asi; total Se and Ni concentration; while the total concentration of Zn, Cr, Ni and K were strongly influenced by the type of rice.
23805204	Molecular Genetic Diversity of Major Indian Rice Cultivars over Decadal Periods.	2013	PLoS One	Genetic diversity in representative sets of high yielding varieties of rice released in India between 1970 and 2010 was studied at molecular level employing hypervariable microsatellite markers. Of 64 rice SSR primer pairs studied, 52 showed polymorphism, when screened in 100 rice genotypes. A total of 184 alleles was identified averaging 3.63 alleles per locus. Cluster analysis clearly grouped the 100 genotypes into their respective decadal periods i.e., 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The trend of diversity over the decadal periods estimated based on the number of alleles (Na), allelic richness (Rs), Nei's genetic diversity index (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and polymorphism information content (PIC) revealed increase of diversity over the periods in year of releasewise and longevitywise classification of rice varieties. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggested more variation in within the decadal periods than among the decades. Pairwise comparison of population differentiation (Fst) among decadal periods showed significant difference between all the pairs except a few. Analysis of trends of appearing and disappearing alleles over decadal periods showed an increase in the appearance of alleles and decrease in disappearance in both the categories of varieties. It was obvious from the present findings, that genetic diversity was progressively on the rise in the varieties released during the decadal periods, between 1970s and 2000s.
23733055	Different expression of miRNAs targeting helicases in rice in response to low and high dose rate γ-ray treatments.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Ionizing radiation currently represents an important tool to generate genetic variability that does not exist in nature, especially in plants. Even so, the radiological protection still represents a subject of regulatory concern. In plants, few reports dealing with the effects of γ-rays, in terms of dose rate (rate of energy deposition) and total dose (energy absorbed per unit mass), are available. In addition, plants are known to be more radioresistant than animals. The use of ionizing radiations for studying various aspects of transcription regulation may help elucidate some of the unanswered questions regarding DNA repair in plants. Under these premises, microRNAs have emerged as molecules involved in gene regulation in response to various environmental conditions as well as in other aspects of plant development. Currently, no report on the changes in microRNAs expression patterns in response to γ-ray treatments exists in plants, even if this subject is extensively studies in human cells. The present study deals with the expression profiles of three miRNAs, namely osa-miR414, osa-miR164e and osa-miR408 and their targeted helicase genes (OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT) in response to different doses of γ-rays delivered both at low and high dose rates. The irradiated rice seeds were grown both in the presence of water and 100 mM NaCl solution. DNA damage and reactive species accumulation were registered, but no dose- or time-dependent expression was observed in response to these treatments.
23930344	White rice consumption and CVD risk factors among Iranian population.	2013	J Health Popul Nutr	Association between white rice intake and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases remained uncertain. Most of the previous published studies have been done in western countries with different lifestyles, and scant data are available from the Middle East region, including Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the structure of Isfahan Healthy Heart Program (IHHP) to assess the association between white rice consumption and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, 3,006 men were included from three counties of Isfahan, Najafabad, and Arak by multistage cluster random-sampling method. Dietary intake was assessed with a 49-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Laboratory assessment was done in a standardized central laboratory. Outcome variables were fasting blood glucose, serum lipid levels, and anthropometric variables. Socioeconomic and demographic data, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) were considered covariates and were adjusted in analysis. In this study, Student's t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. Means of BMI among those subjects who consumed white rice less than 7 times per week and people who consumed 7-14 times per week were almost similar--24.8 +/- 4.3 vs 24.5 +/- 4.7 kg/m2. There was no significant association between white rice consumption and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, such as fasting blood sugar arid serum lipid profiles. Although whole grain consumption has undeniable effect on preventing cardiovascular disease risk, white rice consumption was not associated with cardiovascular risks among Iranian men in the present study. Further prospective studies with a semi-quantitative FFQ or dietary record questionnaire, representing type and portion-size of rice intake as well as cooking methods and other foods consumed with rice that affect glycaemic index (GI) of rice, are required to support our finding and to illustrate the probable mechanism.
23853519	Breeding of new rice cultivar 'Tohoku 194' with 'Sasanishiki'-type good eating quality of cooked rice.	2013	Breed Sci	Cooked rice of 'Sasanishiki' is soft and not as sticky as those of Japanese leading cultivars 'Koshihikari' and 'Hitomebore'. As a method for efficient selection of a breeding line having a good eating quality like that of 'Sasanishiki', the use of physical properties of cooked rice and cooking quality was examined. There were differences of physical properties of the surface layer, starch-iodine blue value per solid substance weight in cooking water and volume expansion of cooked rice between 'Sasanishiki' and 'Hitomebore', these properties being considered to be usable for the selection of breeding lines. Using these traits as selection targets, one line, named 'Tohoku 194', which has eating quality highly similar to that of 'Sasanishiki' and cold tolerance derived from 'Hitomebore', was selected from progeny of a cross between 'Sasanishiki' and 'Hitomebore'. An application for registration as a new variety has been submitted for 'Tohoku 194' under the Japanese Plant Variety Protection Act, and is expected to become a recommended cultivar in Miyagi Prefecture. 'Tohoku 194' may fulfill various demands of consumers and companies in the food industry.
23748009	Acid-thermal dextrin prepared from rice starch: structure and encapsulation properties.	2013	Int J Biol Macromol	In this study, acid-thermal dextrin (ATD) was prepared from rice starch using hydrochloric acid in combination with heat treatment. The structure and encapsulation properties of ATD were examined. The results showed that three fractions (Fraction I, Fraction II, and Fraction III) in ATD were obtained based on the distribution of molecular weight (M(w)) in high-performance size-exclusion chromatographic (HPSEC) spectra. The Fraction II (M(w)≈10,000 Da) was identified using high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), indicating that it consisted of three major groups: DP=2-5, DP=6-15, and DP=25-36. This distribution in chains led to good encapsulating ability of Fraction II to cinnamaldehyde (CIN) and a maximum encapsulation rate reached 41.2 μL/g (CIN/Fraction II) with a molar ratio of about 3:1. The encapsulating mechanism was proposed due to a single helical V-conformation (single resonance at 102.7 ppm) of Fraction II present and observed in solid-state NMR spectra.
23825574	Biogas production by co-digestion of goat manure with three crop residues.	2013	PLoS One	Goat manure (GM) is an excellent raw material for anaerobic digestion because of its high total nitrogen content and fermentation stability. Several comparative assays were conducted on the anaerobic co-digestion of GM with three crop residues (CRs), namely, wheat straw (WS), corn stalks (CS) and rice straw (RS), under different mixing ratios. All digesters were implemented simultaneously under mesophilic temperature at 35±1 °C with a total solid concentration of 8%. Result showed that the combination of GM with CS or RS significantly improved biogas production at all carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios. GM/CS (30:70), GM/CS (70:30), GM/RS (30:70) and GM/RS (50:50) produced the highest biogas yields from different co-substrates (14840, 16023, 15608 and 15698 mL, respectively) after 55 d of fermentation. Biogas yields of GM/WS 30:70 (C/N 35.61), GM/CS 70:30 (C/N 21.19) and GM/RS 50:50 (C/N 26.23) were 1.62, 2.11 and 1.83 times higher than that of CRs, respectively. These values were determined to be the optimal C/N ratios for co-digestion. However, compared with treatments of GM/CS and GM/RS treatments, biogas generated from GM/WS was only slightly higher than the single digestion of GM or WS. This result was caused by the high total carbon content (35.83%) and lignin content (24.34%) in WS, which inhibited biodegradation.
23775636	Biological evaluation of endophytic fungus, Chaetomium globosum JN711454, as potential candidate for improving drug discovery.	2014	Cell Biochem Biophys	The main objective of this research work focused on investigating the biological and chemical aspects of endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum, for pharmaceutical purposes to improve the drug discovery process. The endophytic C. globosum was isolated from healthy leaves of Egyptian medicinal plant Adiantum capillus-veneris collected from Saint Katherine Protectorate, Sinai, Egypt. The identification of C. globosum was on the basis of classical and molecular taxonomy. Gene encoding for 18S rRNA was partially sequenced, submitted to the GenBank and got the accession number JN711454, to resolve the phylogenetic relations with fungal ancestor using phylogenetic tree. To explore the biosynthetic power of endophytic C. globosum JN711454, the fungus was cultivated over five different media, oatmeal, rice, yeast malt glucose, potato dextrose agar (PDA) and Czapek's dox media, for 3 weeks at 30 °C, followed by extraction with different solvents, ethyl acetate (EA), and methanol. The ethyl acetate extract of C. globosum cultivated on PDA medium was the most potent extract. It showed strong antioxidant activity with EC50 11.5 μg/ml, potent anticancer activity with 55 % toxicity toward HepG-2 cells at 100 μg/ml and 66 % cytotoxicity to FGC4 cells at 250 μg/ml, promising butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities (>85 %), and moderate antimicrobial and stopped the attachment of HSV-2 virus to VERO cells. The metabolomic profiling of PDA-EA extract using LC-MS revealed the presence of several metabolites to which the observed bioactivities could be attributed. Here we report for the first time inhibitory activity of endophytic C. globosum JN711454 secondary metabolites to butyrylcholinesterase, one of neuro hydrolase enzymes that play a major role in development of Alzheimer's disease.
23841065	Biosorption of zinc from aqueous solution using chemically treated rice husk.	2013	Biomed Res Int	In this study, adsorption of zinc onto the adsorbent (untreated rice husk and NaOH-treated rice husk) was examined. During the removal process, batch technique was used, and the effects of pH and contact time were investigated. Langmuir isotherm was applied in order to determine the efficiency of NaOH-treated rice husk used as an adsorbent. The zinc adsorption was fast, and equilibrium was attained within 30 min. The maximum removal ratios of zinc for untreated rice husk and NaOH-treated rice husk after 1.5 h were 52.3% and 95.2%, respectively, with initial zinc concentration of 25 mg/L and optimum pH of 4.0. Data obtained from batch adsorption experiments fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Maximum adsorption capacity of zinc onto untreated rice husk and NaOH-treated rice husk was 12.41 mg/g, and 20.08 mg/g respectively, at adsorbent dosage of 1 g/L at 25°C. The nature of functional groups (i.e., amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl) and metal ion interactions was examined by the FT-IR technique. It was concluded that the NaOH-treated rice husk had stronger adsorption capacity for Zn(2+) compared with the untreated rice husk. The NaOH-treated rice husk is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly adsorbent for Zn(2+) removal from aqueous solutions.
23889819	Construction of small RNA-mediated gene regulatory networks in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The root systems play essential roles for plants to anchorage to the soil, and to exploit the mineral and water resources. The molecular mechanisms underlying root development have been extensively studied to improve root system architecture, especially for the crops. Several microRNA (miRNA) families have been demonstrated to be involved in plant root development. However, whether the other small RNA (sRNA) species, which occupy a dominant portion of the plant endogenous sRNA population, possess potential roles in root development remains unclear.

RESULTS: In this study, by using sRNA high-throughput sequencing data, we made a comparison of the sRNA accumulation levels between the rice root tips and the whole roots. The sRNAs highly accumulated in the root tips and in the whole roots were extracted respectively. After Argonaute 1 (AGO1) enrichment analysis, the sRNAs with great potential of performing target cleavages were included for target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation. As a result, lists of the targets regulated by the AGO1-enriched sRNAs were obtained for both the root tips and the whole roots. Further evidences were identified from microarray data of the target genes to support some of the sRNA-target interactions. Specifically, the expression patterns of certain target genes in the root tips and the whole roots were contrary to those of the regulating sRNAs. Besides, several targets were indicated to play important roles in root development based on literature mining.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the regulatory networks mediated by the sRNAs highly accumulated in the root tips or in the whole roots could advance our current understanding of the sRNA-involved molecular mechanisms underlying rice root development. And, the sRNA-target lists could serve as the basis for further functional investigations.
23874903	De novo assembly and characterization of the Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) transcriptome using next-generation pyrosequencing.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli) is an important weed that is a menace to rice cultivation and production. Rapid evolution of herbicide resistance in this weed makes it one of the most difficult to manage using herbicides. Since genome-wide sequence data for barnyardgrass is limited, we sequenced the transcriptomes of susceptible and resistant barnyardgrass biotypes using the 454 GS-FLX platform.

RESULTS: 454 pyrosequencing generated 371,281 raw reads with an average length of 341.8 bp, which made a total length of 126.89 Mb (SRX160526). De novo assembly produced 10,142 contigs (∼5.92 Mb) with an average length of 583 bp and 68,940 singletons (∼22.13 Mb) with an average length of 321 bp. About 244,653 GO term assignments to the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories were obtained. A total of 6,092 contigs and singletons with 2,515 enzyme commission numbers were assigned to 151 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways. Digital abundance analysis using Illumina sequencing identified 78,124 transcripts among susceptible, resistant, herbicide-treated susceptible and herbicide-treated resistant barnyardgrass biotypes. From these analyses, eight herbicide target-site gene groups and four non-target-site gene groups were identified in the resistant biotype. These could be potential candidate genes involved in the herbicide resistance of barnyardgrass and could be used for further functional genomics research. C4 photosynthesis genes including RbcS, RbcL, NADP-me and MDH with complete CDS were identified using PCR and RACE technology.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale transcriptome sequencing of E. crus-galli performed using the 454 GS-FLX platform. Potential candidate genes involved in the evolution of herbicide resistance were identified from the assembled sequences. This transcriptome data may serve as a reference for further gene expression and functional genomics studies, and will facilitate the study of herbicide resistance at the molecular level in this species as well as other weeds.
23932255	Evidence of sibling species between two host-associated populations of brown planthopper, N. lugens (stål) (Homoptera: Delphacidea) complex based on morphology and host-plant relationship studies.	2013	C R Biol	Morphological and host-plant relationship studies were conducted to differentiate two sympatric populations of brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, one from rice (Oryza sativa) and the other from Leersia hexandra, a weed grass. In morphometric studies based on esterase activities, an UPGMA dendrogram using 17 quantitative morphological characters, including stridulatory organs (courtship signal-producing organs) between two sympatric populations of N. lugens, one from rice and the other from L. hexandra, a weed grass revealed that both populations were separated from each other. An out-group, N. bakeri, was found to be completely different from the two sympatric populations of N. lugens. Rice plants were best suited for the establishment of the rice-infesting population, and L. hexandra was a favourable host for the Leersia-infesting population. The individuals derived from one host did not thrive on the other host, as shown by a significant reduction in survival and nymphal development, ovipositional preferences, ovipositional response, and egg hatchability. Therefore, morphological and host-plant relationship studies indicate that rice-associated population with high esterase activities and L. heaxandra-associated population with low esterase activities are two closely related sibling species.
23877038	Phytotoxicity and oxidative stress effect of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid on rice seedlings.	2013	Environ Pollut	The effects of the ionic liquid 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([OMIM]Cl) was studied in hydroponically grown rice seedlings. Observed effects included increased root length and weight at concentrations of 0.1 mg/L [OMIM]Cl, however, as concentrations increased a reversed response was observed where roots and stems grew shorter and the weight decreased. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50,5d) values for root length and stem length were 0.59 mg/L and 0.70 mg/L, respectively. The Hill reaction activity and root system activity in [OMIM]Cl-treated rice seedlings were observed to be lower than the controls, however, root membrane permeability increased. The antioxidant enzyme activity in roots decreased, while in leaves there was an initial stimulation followed by a decrease. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was found to be greater in seedlings subjected to [OMIM]Cl treatment. The cellular structures, such as chloroplasts, mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in rice root and leaf cells were affected at concentrations of 0.6 mg/L [OMIM]Cl.
23911212	Preliminary aquatic risk assessment of imidacloprid after application in an experimental rice plot.	2013	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The potential aquatic risk of application of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for aphid control in rice was assessed. To this end, imidacloprid was applied as Confidor(®) 200 SC at the recommended field dose of 100g a.i./ha to a Portuguese rice plot. Subsequently, fate of the test compound in water and potential effects of water samples on a battery of test species were determined. As compared to the first-tier predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) calculated using MED-Rice (around 30µg/L depending on the scenario used) and US-EPA (78µg/L) simulations, the actual peak concentration measured in the paddy water (52µg/L) was higher and lower, respectively. As was anticipated based on 50% effect concentrations (EC50 values) for Daphnia magna published in the open literature and that calculated in the present study (48h-EC50 immobility=84mg/L), no effects were observed of field water samples on daphnids. The sediment-dwelling ostracod Heterocypris incongruens, however, appeared relatively sensitive towards imidacloprid (6d-EC50 growth inhibition=0.01-0.015mg/L) and a slight effect was indeed noted in field samples taken the first week after application. Species sensitivity distributions based on published EC50 and NOEC values also revealed that other species are likely to be affected at the peak and time-weighted average imidacloprid concentrations, respectively. By applying the relative tolerance approach (i.e. by dividing the EC50 value of a certain species with that of Daphnia magna), ostracods appear to contain the most sensitive taxa to imidacloprid, followed by EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxa. Future field studies into (higher-tier) fate modelling of pesticides in rice paddies and effect assessment on field communities are required to ensure protection of aquatic life and wildlife (e.g. birds) from pesticide stress.
23872030	Consequences of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain symptoms on women's work participation and income: results from a national household sample.	2014	J Urol	PURPOSE: We describe differences in work participation and income by bladder symptom impact and comorbidities among women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 2,767 respondents younger than 65 years identified with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome symptoms were analyzed. The data were taken from the RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology (RICE) survey, and included retrospective self-reports of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome impact, severity, years since onset, related comorbidities (depressive symptomatology, number of conditions), work participation and income, and personal characteristics. Multiple regressions predicted 5 current work outcomes of works now, kept from working by pain, missed work days, days worked when bothered by symptoms and real income change since symptom onset.

RESULTS: Controlling for work status at symptom onset and personal characteristics, greater bladder symptom impact predicted a greater likelihood of not now working, kept more days from working by pain, missed more work days and working more days with symptoms. More depressive symptomatology and greater number of comorbidities predicted reduced work participation. Women experienced no growth in real income since symptom onset. Measures of symptom severity were not associated with any of the economic outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS: Greater interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome symptom impact, depressive symptomatology and count of comorbidities (but not symptom severity) were each associated with less work participation and leveling of women's long-term earnings. Management of bladder symptom impact on nonwork related activities and depressive symptomatology may improve women's work outcomes.
23873639	Improving the mixing performances of rice straw anaerobic digestion for higher biogas production by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation.	2013	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	As a lignocellulose-based substrate for anaerobic digestion, rice straw is characterized by low density, high water absorbability, and poor fluidity. Its mixing performances in digestion are completely different from traditional substrates such as animal manures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was employed to investigate mixing performances and determine suitable stirring parameters for efficient biogas production from rice straw. The results from CFD simulation were applied in the anaerobic digestion tests to further investigate their reliability. The results indicated that the mixing performances could be improved by triple impellers with pitched blade, and complete mixing was easily achieved at the stirring rate of 80 rpm, as compared to 20-60 rpm. However, mixing could not be significantly improved when the stirring rate was further increased from 80 to 160 rpm. The simulation results agreed well with the experimental results. The determined mixing parameters could achieve the highest biogas yield of 370 mL (g TS)(-1) (729 mL (g TS(digested))(-1)) and 431 mL (g TS)(-1) (632 mL (g TS(digested))(-1)) with the shortest technical digestion time (T 80) of 46 days. The results obtained in this work could provide useful guides for the design and operation of biogas plants using rice straw as substrates.
23852132	Differential anoxic expression of sugar-regulated genes reveals diverse interactions between sugar and anaerobic signaling systems in rice.	2013	Mol Cells	The interaction between the dual roles of sugar as a metabolic fuel and a regulatory molecule was unveiled by examining the changes in sugar signaling upon oxygen deprivation, which causes the drastic alteration in the cellular energy status. In our study, the expression of anaerobically induced genes is commonly responsive to sugar, either under the control of hexokinase or non-hexokinase mediated signaling cascades. Only sugar regulation via the hexokinase pathway was susceptible for O2 deficiency or energy deficit conditions evoked by uncoupler. Examination of sugar regulation of those genes under anaerobic conditions revealed the presence of multiple paths underlying anaerobic induction of gene expression in rice, subgrouped into three distinct types. The first of these, which was found in type-1 genes, involved neither sugar regulation nor additional anaerobic induction under anoxia, indicating that anoxic induction is a simple result from the release of sugar repression by O2-deficient conditions. In contrast, type-2 genes also showed no sugar regulation, albeit with enhanced expression under anoxia. Lastly, expression of type-3 genes is highly enhanced with sugar regulation sustained under anoxia. Intriguingly, the inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthesis can reproduce expression pattern of a specific set of anaerobically induced genes, implying that rice cells may sense O2 deprivation, partly via perception of the perturbed cellular energy status. Our study of interaction between sugar signaling and anaerobic conditions has revealed that sugar signaling and the cellular energy status are likely to communicate with each other and influence anaerobic induction of gene expression in rice.
23887081	Tibial subchondral bone mineral density: sources of variability and reproducibility.	2013	Osteoarthritis Cartilage	OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that subchondral bone mineral density (sBMD) measurement may be a relevant parameter of osteoarthritis (OA) progression. However, factors implicating the reproducibility and contributing to the variability of the measurement have not been fully described. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the reproducibility of sBMD by Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and to further examine its sources of variability.

METHODS: In this study, short-term, intra and inter-observer reproducibility of sBMD was examined on knee images obtained on DXA scans. The influence of software (lumbar spine and forearm modes), knee positioning (flexion or extension), site and size of regions of interest (ROI) and use of rice, on both lateral and medial tibial sBMD, were assessed. Root mean square coefficient of variation (RMS CV) and least significant changes (LSC) were calculated.

RESULTS: The short-term precision of sBMD ranged between 2.24% and 5.12% for RMS CV and between 0.053 and 0.135 g/cm(2) for LSC. Good intra-observer precision was found for knee flexion conditions whatever the software used (RMS CV ranging from 0.43 to 1.41%). The reproducibility was dependant from the ROI size (the ROI including joint space exhibiting better precision results than ROI including solely the subchondral plate). For a constant size of the ROI, the precision results were site-dependant. Inter-observer RMS CV results ranged from 0.59 to 5.01% according to ROI and software used. For the specific task of monitoring medial sBMD in the ROI including solely subchondral plate, forearm flexion condition produced the highest intra-observer and short-term precision (respectively RMS CV: 0.45% and 2.77%; LSC: 0.013 and 0.080 g/cm(2)).

CONCLUSION: Taking account into the excellent precision of the sBMD measurements expressed as RMS CV with the protocol proposed in the present study, clinical application of these measurements might be envisaged.
23922843	Evaluation of genome sequencing quality in selected plant species using expressed sequence tags.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: With the completion of genome sequencing projects for more than 30 plant species, large volumes of genome sequences have been produced and stored in online databases. Advancements in sequencing technologies have reduced the cost and time of whole genome sequencing enabling more and more plants to be subjected to genome sequencing. Despite this, genome sequence qualities of multiple plants have not been evaluated.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Integrity and accuracy were calculated to evaluate the genome sequence quality of 32 plants. The integrity of a genome sequence is presented by the ratio of chromosome size and genome size (or between scaffold size and genome size), which ranged from 55.31% to nearly 100%. The accuracy of genome sequence was presented by the ratio between matched EST and selected ESTs where 52.93% ∼ 98.28% and 89.02% ∼ 98.85% of the randomly selected clean ESTs could be mapped to chromosome and scaffold sequences, respectively. According to the integrity, accuracy and other analysis of each plant species, thirteen plant species were divided into four levels. Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays had the highest quality, followed by Brachypodium distachyon, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera and Glycine max, Sorghum bicolor, Solanum lycopersicum and Fragaria vesca, and Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula and Malus × domestica in that order. Assembling the scaffold sequences into chromosome sequences should be the primary task for the remaining nineteen species. Low GC content and repeat DNA influences genome sequence assembly.

CONCLUSION: The quality of plant genome sequences was found to be lower than envisaged and thus the rapid development of genome sequencing projects as well as research on bioinformatics tools and the algorithms of genome sequence assembly should provide increased processing and correction of genome sequences that have already been published.
23857470	Diversity in the complexity of phosphate starvation transcriptomes among rice cultivars based on RNA-Seq profiles.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Rice has developed several morphological and physiological strategies to adapt to phosphate starvation in the soil. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of response to phosphate starvation, we performed mRNA sequencing of 4 rice cultivars with variation in growth response to Pi starvation as indicated by the shoot/root dry weight ratio. Approximately 254 million sequence reads were mapped onto the IRGSP-1.0 reference rice genome sequence and an average of about 5,000 transcripts from each cultivar were found to be responsive under phosphate starvation. Comparative analysis of the RNA-Seq profiles of the 4 cultivars revealed similarities as well as distinct differences in expression of these responsive transcripts. We elucidated a set of core responsive transcripts including annotated and unannotated transcripts commonly expressed in the 4 cultivars but with different levels of expression. De novo assembly of unmapped reads to the Nipponbare genome generated a set of sequence contigs representing potential new transcripts that may be involved in tolerance to phosphate starvation. This study can be used for identification of genes and gene networks associated with environmental stress and the development of novel strategies for improving tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice and other cereal crops.
23849468	Heavy metals in food, house dust, and water from an e-waste recycling area in South China and the potential risk to human health.	2013	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Ni) were measured in the foodstuffs, house dust, underground/drinking water, and soil from an electronic waste (e-waste) area in South China. Elevated concentrations of these potentially toxic metals were observed in the samples but not in drinking water. The health risks for metal exposure via food consumption, dust ingestion, and drinking water were evaluated for local residents. For the average residents in the e-waste area, the non-carcinogenic risks arise predominantly from rice (hazard index=3.3), vegetables (2.2), and house dust (1.9) for adults, while the risks for young children are dominated by house dust (15). Drinking water may provide a negligible contribution to risk. However, local residents who use groundwater as a water supply source are at high non-carcinogenic risk. The potential cancer risks from oral intake of Pb are 8×10(-5) and 3×10(-4) for average adults and children, and thus groundwater would have a great potential to induce cancer (5×10(-4) and 1×10(-3)) in a highly exposed population. The results also reveal that the risk from oral exposure is much higher than the risk from inhalation and dermal contact with house dust.
23898802	Pretreatment of rice straw with combined process using dilute sulfuric acid and aqueous ammonia.	2013	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: Use of lignocellulosic biomass has received attention lately because it can be converted into various versatile chemical compounds by biological processes. In this study, a two-step pretreatment with dilute sulfuric acid and aqueous ammonia was performed efficiently on rice straw to obtain fermentable sugar. The soaking in aqueous ammonia process was also optimized by a statistical method.

RESULTS: Response surface methodology was employed. The determination coefficient (R(2)) value was found to be 0.9607 and the coefficient of variance was 6.77. The optimal pretreatment conditions were a temperature of 42.75°C, an aqueous ammonia concentration of 20.93%, and a reaction time of 48 h. The optimal enzyme concentration for saccharification was 30 filter paper units. The crystallinity index was approximately 60.23% and the Fourier transform infrared results showed the distinct peaks of glucan. Ethanol production using Saccharomyces cerevisiae K35 was performed to verify whether the glucose saccharified from rice straw was fermentable.

CONCLUSIONS: The combined pretreatment using dilute sulfuric acid and aqueous ammonia on rice straw efficiently yielded fermentable sugar and achieved almost the same crystallinity index as that of α-cellulose.
23935868	Mapping of quantitative trait loci underlying cold tolerance in rice seedlings via high-throughput sequencing of pooled extremes.	2013	PLoS One	Low temperature is a major limiting factor in rice growth and development. Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling cold tolerance is important for rice breeding. Recent studies have suggested that bulked segregant analysis (BSA) combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be an efficient and cost-effective way for QTL mapping. In this study, we employed NGS-assisted BSA to map QTLs conferring cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice. By deep sequencing of a pair of large DNA pools acquired from a very large F3 population (10,800 individuals), we obtained ∼450,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after strict screening. We employed two statistical methods for QTL analysis based on these SNPs, which yielded consistent results. Six QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 8 and 10. The three most significant QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2 and 8 were validated by comparison with previous studies. Two QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 5 were also identified previously, but at the booting stage rather than the seedling stage, suggesting that some QTLs may function at different developmental stages, which would be useful for cold tolerance breeding in rice. Compared with previously reported QTL mapping studies for cold tolerance in rice based on the traditional approaches, the results of this study demonstrated the advantages of NGS-assisted BSA in both efficiency and statistical power.
23906843	Biosynthesis of homoeriodictyol from eriodictyol by flavone 3'-O-methyltransferase from recombinant Yarrowia lioplytica: Heterologous expression, biochemical characterization, and optimal transformation.	2013	J Biotechnol	In this work, we attempted to synthesize homoeriodictyol by transferring one methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to eriodictyol using flavone 3'-O-methyltransferase ROMT-9, which was produced by recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica. Specifically, the ROMT-9 gene from rice was synthesized and cloned into the multi-copy integrative vector pINA1297, and was further expressed in Y. lipolytica with a growth phase-dependent constitutive promoter hp4d. The highest ROMT-9 activity reached 5.53 U/L after 4 days of culture in shake flask. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified ROMT-9 were 8.0 and 37 °C, respectively. The purified enzyme was stable up to 40 °C, and retained more than 80% of its maximal activity between pH 6.5 and 9.0. The recombinant ROMT-9 did not require Mg²⁺ for catalysis, while was completely inhibited in the presence of 5 mM Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Ba²⁺, Al³⁺, or Ni²⁺. The purified ROMT-9 was used to synthesize homoeriodictyol, and the maximal transformation ratio reached 52.4% at 16 h under the following conditions: eriodictyol 0.2 g/L, ROMT-9 0.16 g/L, SAM 0.2 g/L, CH₃OH 6% (v/v), temperature 37 °C, and pH 8.0. This work provides an alternative strategy for efficient synthesis of homoeriodictyol and compared to the traditional plant extraction or chemical synthesis, the biotransformation approach generates less environmental pollution and has a great potential for the sustainable production of homoeriodictyol.
23647140	The mechanism of ORFH79 suppression with the artificial restorer fertility gene Mt-GRP162.	2013	New Phytol	The restoration fertility complex (RFC) was previously identified in Honglian (HL)-cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) rice (Oryza sativa), and glycine-rich protein 162 (GRP162) is responsible for binding to the CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79. Here, we engineered a recombinant GRP162 containing the mitochondrial transit peptide, termed Mt-GRP162, as an artificial restorer of fertility (Rf) gene. Mt-GRP162 was confirmed to bind to CMS-associated RNA and to localize to the mitochondria. The transgenic plants showed restored fertility with partially functional pollen. We found that the expression of ORFH79 decreased in transgenic plants, while the expression of atp6-orfH79 was not changed. These findings indicate that Mt-GRP162 restores fertility by suppressing the expression of the cytotoxic protein ORFH79 at the post-transcriptional level rather than via the cleavage of atp6-orfH79 in the presence of RFC. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of restoration through diverse pathways.
23743425	Sulfite-formaldehyde pretreatment on rice straw for the improvement of enzymatic saccharification.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Rice straw is one of the most abundant agricultural residues in China. It is considered as a promising raw material for bioethanol production. In this work, rice straw was pretreated by sodium sulfite-formaldehyde (SF) for improving enzymatic saccharification. The SF pretreatment, using proven technology and industrialized equipment, showed efficient delignification selectivity and high carbohydrates retention in pretreated solid. The highest sugar yields of 79.0%, 88.8% and 71.1% for total sugar, glucan and xylan, respectively were obtained at an enzyme loading of 40 FPU/g-substrate after the raw material pretreated with 12% sodium sulfite at 160°C. About 75% of lignin was dissolved in pretreatment spent liquor and 78% of silica was retained in the residue of enzymatic hydrolysis. The results proved sulfite-formaldehyde as a promising pretreatment for the production of bioethanol as well as potential high value added by-products of silica nanoparticles and lignosulfonate.
23706591	Quiescence in rice submergence tolerance: an evolutionary hypothesis.	2013	Trends Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa) varieties differ considerably in their tolerance to submergence, a trait that has been associated with the SUB1A gene. Recently, this gene was found in some wild rice species and landraces, which along with O. sativa, belong to the AA genome type group. On the basis of geographical and historical data, we hypothesize that SUB1A-1 from wild species may have been introgressed into domesticated rice. This introgression probably occurred in the Ganges Basin, with the subsequent spread of the SUB1A-1 to other areas of South Asia due to human migration. The lack of the SUB1A gene in diploid CC genome type wild rice showing submergence-tolerant traits suggests the presence of a different survival mechanism in this genetic group.
23698631	Zn uptake, translocation and grain Zn loading in rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes selected for Zn deficiency tolerance and high grain Zn.	2013	J Exp Bot	Zn deficiency is a widespread problem in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown under flooded conditions, limiting growth and grain Zn accumulation. Genotypes with Zn deficiency tolerance or high grain Zn have been identified in breeding programmes, but little is known about the physiological mechanisms conferring these traits. A protocol was developed for growing rice to maturity in agar nutrient solution (ANS), with optimum Zn-sufficient growth achieved at 1.5 μM ZnSO4.7H2O. The redox potential in ANS showed a decrease from +350 mV to -200 mV, mimicking the reduced conditions of flooded paddy soils. In subsequent experiments, rice genotypes contrasting for Zn deficiency tolerance and grain Zn were grown in ANS with sufficient and deficient Zn to assess differences in root uptake of Zn, root-to-shoot Zn translocation, and in the predominant sources of Zn accumulation in the grain. Zn efficiency of a genotype was highly influenced by root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and total Zn uptake. Translocation of Zn from root to shoot was more limiting at later growth stages than at the vegetative stage. Under Zn-sufficient conditions, continued root uptake during the grain-filling stage was the predominant source of grain Zn loading in rice, whereas, under Zn-deficient conditions, some genotypes demonstrated remobilization of Zn from shoot and root to grain in addition to root uptake. Understanding the mechanisms of grain Zn loading in rice is crucial in selecting high grain Zn donors for target-specific breeding and also to establish fertilizer and water management strategies for achieving high grain Zn.
23664883	Transgenic indica rice lines, expressing Brassica juncea Nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (BjNPR1), exhibit enhanced resistance to major pathogens.	2013	J Biotechnol	Brassica juncea Nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (BjNPR1) has been introduced into commercial indica rice varieties by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Transgenic rice plants were regenerated from the phosphinothricin-resistant calli obtained after co-cultivation with Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 harbouring Ti plasmid pSB111-bar-BjNPR1. Molecular analyses confirmed the stable integration and expression of BjNPR1 in various transgenic rice lines. Transgenes NPR1 and bar were stably inherited and disclosed co-segregation in subsequent generations in a Mendelian fashion. Homozygous transgenic rice lines expressing BjNPR1 protein displayed enhanced resistance to rice blast, sheath blight and bacterial leaf blight diseases. Rice transformants with higher levels of NPR1 revealed notable increases in plant height, panicle length, flag-leaf length, number of seeds/panicle and seed yield/plant as compared to the untransformed plants. The overall results amply demonstrate the profound impact of BjNPR1 in imparting resistance against major pathogens of rice. The multipotent BjNPR1, as such, seems promising as a prime candidate gene to fortify crop plants with durable resistance against various pathogens.
23755056	Examining strategies to facilitate vitamin B1 biofortification of plants by genetic engineering.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Thiamin (vitamin B1) is made by plants and microorganisms but is an essential micronutrient in the human diet. All organisms require it as a cofactor in its form as thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) for the activity of key enzymes of central metabolism. In humans, deficiency is widespread particularly in populations where polished rice is a major component of the diet. Considerable progress has been made on the elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway within the last few years enabling concrete strategies for biofortification purposes to be devised, with a particular focus here on genetic engineering. Furthermore, the vitamin has been shown to play a role in both abiotic and biotic stress responses. The precursors for de novo biosynthesis of thiamin differ between microorganisms and plants. Bacteria use intermediates derived from purine and isoprenoid biosynthesis, whereas the pathway in yeast involves the use of compounds from the vitamin B3 and B6 groups. Plants on the other hand use a combination of the bacterial and yeast pathways and there is subcellular partitioning of the biosynthesis steps. Specifically, thiamin biosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of plants through the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are then coupled to form thiamin monophosphate (TMP). Phosphorylation of thiamin to form TPP occurs in the cytosol. Therefore, thiamin (or TMP) must be exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol for the latter step to be executed. The regulation of biosynthesis is mediated through riboswitches, where binding of the product TPP to the pre-mRNA of a biosynthetic gene modulates expression. Here we examine and hypothesize on genetic engineering approaches attempting to increase the thiamin content employing knowledge gained with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We will discuss the regulatory steps that need to be taken into consideration and can be used a prerequisite for devising such strategies in crop plants.
23700971	Expression in Arabidopsis and cellular localization reveal involvement of rice NRAMP, OsNRAMP1, in arsenic transport and tolerance.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Irrigation of paddy fields to arsenic (As) containing groundwater leads to As accumulation in rice grains and causes serious health risk to the people worldwide. To reduce As intake via consumption of contaminated rice grain, identification of the mechanisms for As accumulation and detoxification in rice is a prerequisite. Herein, we report involvement of a member of rice NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein) transporter, OsNRAMP1, in As, in addition to cadmium (Cd), accumulation through expression in yeast and Arabidopsis. Expression of OsNRAMP1 in yeast mutant (fet3fet4) rescued iron (Fe) uptake and exhibited enhanced accumulation of As and Cd. Expression of OsNRAMP1 in Arabidopsis provided tolerance with enhanced As and Cd accumulation in root and shoot. Cellular localization revealed that OsNRAMP1 resides on plasma membrane of endodermis and pericycle cells and may assist in xylem loading for root to shoot mobilization. This is the first report demonstrating role of NRAMP in xylem mediated loading and enhanced accumulation of As and Cd in plants. We propose that genetic modification of OsNRAMP1 in rice might be helpful in developing rice with low As and Cd content in grain and minimize the risk of food chain contamination to these toxic metals.
23717314	Advances in functional genomics for investigating salinity stress tolerance mechanisms in cereals.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Abiotic stresses such as low water availability and high salinity are major causes of cereal crop yield losses and significantly impact on sustainability. Wheat and barley are two of the most important cereal crops (after maize and rice) and are grown in increasingly hostile environments with soil salinity and drought both expected to increase this century, reducing the availability of arable land. Barley and wheat are classified as glycophytes (salt-sensitive), yet they are more salt-tolerant than other cereal crops such as rice and so are good models for studying salt tolerance in cereals. The exploitation of genetic variation of phenotypic traits through plant breeding could significantly improve growth of cereals in salinity-affected regions, thus leading to improved crop yields. Genetic variation in phenotypic traits for abiotic stress tolerance have been identified in land races and wild germplasm but the molecular basis of these differences is often difficult to determine due to the complex genetic nature of these species. High-throughput functional genomics technologies, such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and ionomics are powerful tools for investigating the molecular responses of plants to abiotic stress. The advancement of these technologies has allowed for the identification and quantification of transcript/metabolites in specific cell types and/or tissues. Using these new technologies on plants will provide a powerful tool to uncovering genetic traits in more complex species such as wheat and barley and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of salinity stress tolerance.
23649897	Genome-wide organization and expression profiling of the NAC transcription factor family in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.).	2013	DNA Res	NAC [no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis thaliana transcription activation factor [ATAF1/2] and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC2)] proteins belong to one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor (TF) families and play important roles in plant development processes, response to biotic and abiotic cues and hormone signalling. Our genome-wide analysis identified 110 StNAC genes in potato encoding for 136 proteins, including 14 membrane-bound TFs. The physical map positions of StNAC genes on 12 potato chromosomes were non-random, and 40 genes were found to be distributed in 16 clusters. The StNAC proteins were phylogenetically clustered into 12 subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of StNACs along with their Arabidopsis and rice counterparts divided these proteins into 18 subgroups. Our comparative analysis has also identified 36 putative TNAC proteins, which appear to be restricted to Solanaceae family. In silico expression analysis, using Illumina RNA-seq transcriptome data, revealed tissue-specific, biotic, abiotic stress and hormone-responsive expression profile of StNAC genes. Several StNAC genes, including StNAC072 and StNAC101that are orthologs of known stress-responsive Arabidopsis RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 26 (RD26) were identified as highly abiotic stress responsive. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis largely corroborated the expression profile of StNAC genes as revealed by the RNA-seq data. Taken together, this analysis indicates towards putative functions of several StNAC TFs, which will provide blue-print for their functional characterization and utilization in potato improvement.
23664583	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family in barley: identification of members, enzyme activity, and gene expression pattern.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important cereals in many developing countries where drought stress considerably diminishes agricultural production. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs EC 2.5.1.18) are multifunctional enzymes which play a crucial role in cellular detoxification and oxidative stress tolerance. In this study, 84 GST genes were identified in barley by a comprehensive in silico approach. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis grouped these HvGST proteins in eight classes. The largest numbers of the HvGST genes (50) were included in the Tau class followed by 21 genes in Phi, five in Zeta, two in DHAR, two in EF1G, two in Lambda, and one each in TCHQD and Theta classes. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative GSTs from Arabidopsis, rice, and barley indicated that major functional diversification within the GST family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. However, intra-specious duplication seems to be common. Expression patterns of five GST genes from Phi and Tau classes were investigated in three barley genotypes (Yusof [drought-tolerant], Moroc9-75 [drought-sensitive], and HS1 [wild ecotype]) under control and drought-stressed conditions, during the vegetative stage. All investigated genes were up-regulated significantly under drought stress and/or showed a higher level of transcripts in the tolerant cultivar. Additionally, GST enzyme activity was superior in Yusof and induced in the extreme-drought-treated leaves, while it was not changed in Moroc9-75 under drought conditions. Moreover, the lowest and highest levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in the Yusof and Moroc9-75 cultivars, respectively. Based on the achieved results, detoxification and antioxidant activity of GSTs might be considered an important factor in the drought tolerance of barley genotypes for further investigations.
23638881	Mapping QTLs for traits related to salinity tolerance at seedling stage of rice (Oryza sativa L.): an agrigenomics study of an Iranian rice population.	2013	OMICS	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops in the world, especially in Asian countries, and salinity is a major constraint to the sustainability and expansion of rice cultivation. Genetically improving salt tolerance of rice is a highly important objective of rice breeding programs. Traits such as salt tolerance are quantitatively inherited. Hence, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with molecular markers can be very helpful to plant breeders in the field of agricultural genomics (AgriGenomics). In this investigation, QTL analysis of physiological traits related to salt tolerance was carried out using F2:4 population of rice derived from a cross between a salt-tolerant variety, Gharib (indica), and a salt-sensitive variety, Sepidroud (indica). A linkage map based on 148 F2 individuals was constructed with 131 SSR markers and 105 AFLP markers, covering 2475.7 cM of rice genome with an average distance of 10.48 cM between flanking markers. A total of 41 QTLs for twelve physiological traits under salinity stress were detected distributed on all rice chromosomes, some of them being reported for the first time. Also, overlapping of QTLs related to salt tolerance were observed in this study. Some of the identified QTLs on specific chromosomal regions explaining high phenotypic variance could be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs. New QTLs retrieved in this study play an important role in growth of rice at seedling stage in an Iranian local population under high salinity conditions.
23715238	Rice husks as a sustainable source of nanostructured silicon for high performance Li-ion battery anodes.	2013	Sci Rep	The recovery of useful materials from earth-abundant substances is of strategic importance for industrial processes. Despite the fact that Si is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, processes to form Si nanomaterials is usually complex, costly and energy-intensive. Here we show that pure Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) can be derived directly from rice husks (RHs), an abundant agricultural byproduct produced at a rate of 1.2 × 10(8) tons/year, with a conversion yield as high as 5% by mass. And owing to their small size (10-40 nm) and porous nature, these recovered SiNPs exhibits high performance as Li-ion battery anodes, with high reversible capacity (2,790 mA h g(-1), seven times greater than graphite anodes) and long cycle life (86% capacity retention over 300 cycles). Using RHs as the raw material source, overall energy-efficient, green, and large scale synthesis of low-cost and functional Si nanomaterials is possible.
22970587	Cloud point extraction of copper, lead, cadmium, and iron using 2,6-diamino-4-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine and nonionic surfactant, and their flame atomic absorption spectrometric determination in water and canned food samples.	None	J AOAC Int	A cloud point extraction procedure was optimized for the separation and preconcentration of lead(II), cadmium(II), copper(II), and iron(III) ions in various water and canned food samples. The metal ions formed complexes with 2,6-diamino-4-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine that were extracted by surfactant-rich phases in the nonionic surfactant Triton X-114. The surfactant-rich phase was diluted with 1 M HNO3 in methanol prior to its analysis by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of the proposed method, such as sample pH, complexing agent concentration, surfactant concentration, temperature, and incubation time, were optimized. LOD values based on three times the SD of the blank (3Sb) were 0.38, 0.48, 1.33, and 1.85 microg/L for cadmium(II), copper(II), lead(II), and iron(III) ions, respectively. The precision (RSD) of the method was in the 1.86-3.06% range (n=7). Validation of the procedure was carried out by analysis of National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material (NIST-SRM) 1568a Rice Flour and GBW 07605 Tea. The method was applied to water and canned food samples for determination of metal ions.
23413968	The complete mitochondrial genome of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica.	2012	J Insect Sci	The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was determined as a circular molecular of 15,273 bp in size. The mitogenome composition (37 genes) and gene order are the same as the other lepidopterans. Nucleotide composition of the C. cephalonica mitogenome is highly A+T biased (80.43%) like other insects. Twelve protein-coding genes start with a typical ATN codon, with the exception of coxl gene, which uses CGA as the initial codon. Nine protein-coding genes have the common stop codon TAA, and the nad2, cox1, cox2, and nad4 have single T as the incomplete stop codon. 22 tRNA genes demonstrated cloverleaf secondary structure. The mitogenome has several large intergenic spacer regions, the spacer1 between trnQ gene and nad2 gene, which is common in Lepidoptera. The spacer 3 between trnE and trnF includes microsatellite-like repeat regions (AT)18 and (TTAT)(3). The spacer 4 (16 bp) between trnS2 gene and nad1 gene has a motif ATACTAT; another species, Sesamia inferens encodes ATCATAT at the same position, while other lepidopteran insects encode a similar ATACTAA motif. The spacer 6 is A+T rich region, include motif ATAGA and a 20-bp poly(T) stretch and two microsatellite (AT)(9), (AT)(8) elements.
22611233	Comprehending crystalline β-carotene accumulation by comparing engineered cell models and the natural carotenoid-rich system of citrus.	2012	J Exp Bot	Genetic manipulation of carotenoid biosynthesis has become a recent focus for the alleviation of vitamin A deficiency. However, the genetically modified phenotypes often challenge the expectation, suggesting the incomplete comprehension of carotenogenesis. Here, embryogenic calli were engineered from four citrus genotypes as engineered cell models (ECMs) by over-expressing a bacterial phytoene synthase gene (CrtB). Ripe flavedos (the coloured outer layer of citrus fruits), which exhibit diverse natural carotenoid patterns, were offered as a comparative system to the ECMs. In the ECMs, carotenoid patterns showed diversity depending on the genotypes and produced additional carotenoids, such as lycopene, that were absent from the wild-type lines. Especially in the ECMs from dark-grown culture, there emerged a favoured β,β-pathway characterized by a striking accumulation of β-carotene, which was dramatically different from those in the wild-type calli and ripe flavedos. Unlike flavedos that contained a typical chromoplast development, the ECMs sequestered most carotenoids in the amyloplasts in crystal form, which led the amyloplast morphology to show a chromoplast-like profile. Transcriptional analysis revealed a markedly flavedo-specific expression of the β-carotene hydroxylase gene (HYD), which was suppressed in the calli. Co-expression of CrtB and HYD in the ECMs confirmed that HYD predominantly mediated the preferred carotenoid patterns between the ECMs and flavedos, and also revealed that the carotenoid crystals in the ECMs were mainly composed of β-carotene. In addition, a model is proposed to interpret the common appearance of a favoured β,β-pathway and the likelihood of carotenoid degradation potentially mediated by photo-oxidation and vacuolar phagocytosis in the ECMs is discussed.
22306463	A structural model for the generation of continuous curvature on the surface of a retroviral capsid.	2012	J Mol Biol	The genome of a retrovirus is surrounded by a convex protein shell, or capsid, that helps facilitate infection. The major part of the capsid surface is formed by interlocking capsid protein (CA) hexamers. We report electron and X-ray crystallographic analysis of a variety of specimens assembled in vitro from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) CA. These specimens all contain CA hexamers arranged in planar layers, modeling the authentic capsid surface. The specimens differ only in the number of layers incorporated and in the disposition of each layer with respect to its neighbor. The body of each hexamer, formed by the N-terminal domain of CA, is connected to neighboring hexamers through C-terminal domain dimerization. The resulting layer structure is very malleable due to inter-domain flexibility. A helix-capping hydrogen bond between the two domains of RSV CA creates a pivot point, which is central to controlling their relative movement. A similar mechanism for the governance of inter-domain motion was recently described for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid, although there is negligible sequence identity between RSV and HIV-1 CA in the region of contact, and the amino acids involved in creating the pivot are not conserved. Our observations allow development of a physically realistic model for the way neighboring hexamers can tilt out of plane, deforming the hexamer layer and generating the continuously curved surfaces that are a feature of all retroviral capsids.
22349012	Identification and validation of a major quantitative trait locus for slow-rusting resistance to stripe rust in wheat.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks (Pst), is one of the most important wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) diseases and causes significant yield losses. A recombinant inbred (RI) population derived from a cross between Yanzhan 1 and Xichang 76-9 cultivars was evaluated for resistance to wheat stripe rust strain CYR32 at both the seedling and adult plant stages. Four resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in this population, in which the major one, designated as Yrq1, was mapped on chromosome 2DS. The strategy of using the Brachypodium distachyon genome, wheat expressed sequence tags and a draft DNA sequences (scaffolds) of the D-genome (Aegilops tauschii Coss.) for the development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was successfully used to identify 147 SSRs in hexaploid wheat. Of the 19 polymorphic SSRs in the RI population, 17 SSRs were mapped in the homeologous group 2 chromosomes near Yrq1 region and eight SSRs were genetically mapped in the 2.7 cM region of Yrq1, providing abundant DNA markers for fine-mapping of Yrq1 and marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding program. The effectiveness of Yrq1 was validated in an independent population, indicating that this resistance QTL can be successfully transferred into a susceptible cultivar for improvement of stripe rust resistance.
22747909	Computational identification and analysis of novel sugarcane microRNAs.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-regulation of gene expression plays a key role in the development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Deep sequencing analyses accelerate the process of small RNA discovery in many plants and expand our understanding of miRNA-regulated processes. We therefore undertook small RNA sequencing of sugarcane miRNAs in order to understand their complexity and to explore their role in sugarcane biology.

RESULTS: A bioinformatics search was carried out to discover novel miRNAs that can be regulated in sugarcane plants submitted to drought and salt stresses, and under pathogen infection. By means of the presence of miRNA precursors in the related sorghum genome, we identified 623 candidates of new mature miRNAs in sugarcane. Of these, 44 were classified as high confidence miRNAs. The biological function of the new miRNAs candidates was assessed by analyzing their putative targets. The set of bona fide sugarcane miRNA includes those likely targeting serine/threonine kinases, Myb and zinc finger proteins. Additionally, a MADS-box transcription factor and an RPP2B protein, which act in development and disease resistant processes, could be regulated by cleavage (21-nt-species) and DNA methylation (24-nt-species), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: A large scale investigation of sRNA in sugarcane using a computational approach has identified a substantial number of new miRNAs and provides detailed genotype-tissue-culture miRNA expression profiles. Comparative analysis between monocots was valuable to clarify aspects about conservation of miRNA and their targets in a plant whose genome has not yet been sequenced. Our findings contribute to knowledge of miRNA roles in regulatory pathways in the complex, polyploidy sugarcane genome.
22291005	Molecular detection of plant pathogenic bacteria using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism.	2012	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	The application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to molecular diagnostics holds great promise for the early identification of agriculturally important plant pathogens. Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomoans axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae are phytopathogenic bacteria, which can infect vegetables, cause severe yield loss. PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) is a simple and powerful technique for identifying sequence changes in amplified DNA. The technique of PCR-SSCP is being exploited so far, only to detect and diagnose human bacterial pathogens in addition to plant pathogenic fungi. Selective media and serology are the commonly used methods for the detection of plant pathogens in infected plant materials. In this study, we developed PCR-SSCP technique to identify phytopathogenic bacteria. The PCR product was denatured and separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. SSCP banding patterns were detected by silver staining of nucleic acids. We tested over 56 isolates of R. solanacearum, 44 isolates of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, and 20 isolates of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. With the use of universal primer 16S rRNA, we could discriminate such species at the genus and species levels. Species-specific patterns were obtained for bacteria R. solanacearum, X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, and X. oryzae pv. oryzae. The potential use of PCR-SSCP technique for the detection and diagnosis of phytobacterial pathogens is discussed in the present paper.

23065086	Identification and field evaluation of fermentation volatiles from wine and vinegar that mediate attraction of spotted wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii.	2012	J Chem Ecol	Previous studies suggest that olfactory cues from damaged and fermented fruits play important roles in resource recognition of polyphagous spotted wing Drosophila flies (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). They are attracted to fermented sweet materials, such as decomposing fruits but also wines and vinegars, and to ubiquitous fermentation volatiles, such as acetic acid and ethanol. Gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), two-choice laboratory bioassays, and field trapping experiments were used to identify volatile compounds from wine and vinegar that are involved in SWD attraction. In addition to acetic acid and ethanol, consistent EAD responses were obtained for 13 volatile wine compounds and seven volatile vinegar compounds, with all of the vinegar EAD-active compounds also present in wine. In a field trapping experiment, the 9-component vinegar blend and 15-component wine blend were similarly attractive when compared to an acetic acid plus ethanol mixture, but were not as attractive as the wine plus vinegar mixture. In two-choice laboratory bioassays, 7 EAD-active compounds (ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl lactate, 1-hexanol, isoamyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, and ethyl sorbate), when added singly to the mixture at the same concentrations tested in the field, decreased the attraction of SWD to the mixture of acetic acid and ethanol. The blends composed of the remaining EAD-active chemicals, an 8-component wine blend [acetic acid + ethanol + acetoin + grape butyrate + methionol + isoamyl lactate + 2-phenylethanol + diethyl succinate] and a 5-component vinegar blend [acetic acid + ethanol + acetoin + grape butyrate + 2-phenylethanol] were more attractive than the acetic acid plus ethanol mixture, and as attractive as the wine plus vinegar mixture in both laboratory assays and the field trapping experiment. These results indicate that these volatiles in wine and vinegar are crucial for SWD attraction to fermented materials on which they feed as adults.
22621926	The small hydrophobic protein of the human respiratory syncytial virus forms pentameric ion channels.	2012	J Biol Chem	The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is encoded by the human respiratory syncytial virus. Its absence leads to viral attenuation in the context of whole organisms, and it prevents apoptosis in infected cells. Herein, we have examined the structure of SH protein in detergent micelles and in lipid bilayers, by solution NMR and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. We found that SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane domain and forms homopentamers in several detergents. In detergent micelles, the transmembrane domain is flanked N-terminally by an α-helix that forms a ring around the lumen of the pore and C-terminally by an extended β-turn. SH protein was found in the plasma membrane of transiently expressing HEK 293 cells, which showed pH-dependent (acid-activated) channel activity. Channel activity was abolished in mutants lacking both native His residues, His(22) and His(51), but not when either His was present. Herein, we propose that the pentameric model of SH protein presented is a physiologically relevant conformation, albeit probably not the only one, in which SH contributes to RSV infection and replication. Viroporins are short (∼100 amino acids) viral membrane proteins that form oligomers of a defined size, act as proton or ion channels, and in general enhance membrane permeability in the host. However, with some exceptions, their precise biological role of their channel activity is not understood. In general, viroporins resemble poorly specialized proteins but are nevertheless critical for viral fitness. In vivo, viruses lacking viroporins usually exhibit an attenuated or weakened phenotype, altered tropism, and diminished pathological effects. We have chosen to study the SH protein, 64 amino acids long, found in the human respiratory syncytial virus because of the effect of RSV on human health and the lack of adequate antivirals. We show that SH protein forms oligomers that behave as ion channels when activated at low pH. This study adds SH protein to a growing group of viroporins that have been structurally characterized. Although the precise biological role of this pentameric channel is still unknown, this report is nevertheless essential to fill some of the many gaps that exist in the understanding of SH protein function.
22407977	Characterization of neutralizing affinity-matured human respiratory syncytial virus F binding antibodies in the sub-picomolar affinity range.	2012	J Mol Recognit	In the human adaptation and optimization of a mouse anti-human respiratory syncytial virus neutralizing antibody, affinity assessment was crucial to distinguish among potential candidates and to evaluate whether this correlated with function in vitro and in vivo. This affinity assessment was complicated by the trimeric nature of the antigen target, respiratory syncytial virus F (RSV-F) glycoprotein. In the initial affinity screen, surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the intrinsic binding affinities of anti-RSV-F Fab and immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the extracellular domain of RSV-F. This assessment required minimal biotinylation of the RSV-F protein and design of a capture strategy to minimize avidity effects. Approximately 30 Fabs were selected from three optimization phage display libraries on the basis of an initial ELISA screen. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated the success of optimization with some candidates from the screened libraries having low picomolar dissociation constants, more than 700-fold tighter than the parental monoclonal antibody (B21M). The affinities of these antibodies were further evaluated by a kinetic exclusion assay, a solution binding technology. One IgG (monoclonal antibody 029) displayed a low picomolar K(D) comparable with that of motavizumab, an RSV antibody in clinical study. Kinetic exclusion assay showed that two other of the matured IgGs (011 and 019) had sub-picomolar dissociation constants that could not be resolved further. We discuss the relevance of these interaction analysis results in the light of recently published data on the mechanism of F-driven viral fusion during paramyxoviral infection and 101F epitope conservation revealed from the recent crystal structure of RSV-F in the post-fusion state.
23037808	A steep radioiodine dose response scalable to humans in sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)-mediated radiovirotherapy for prostate cancer.	2012	Cancer Gene Ther	The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) directs the uptake and concentration of iodide in thyroid cells. We have extended the use of NIS-mediated radioiodine therapy to prostate cancer. We have developed a prostate tumor specific conditionally replicating adenovirus that expresses hNIS (Ad5PB_RSV-NIS). For radiovirotherapy to be effective in humans, the radioiodine dose administered in the pre-clinical animal model should scale to the range of acceptable doses in humans. We performed (131)I dose-response experiments aiming to determine the dose required in mice to achieve efficient radiovirotherapy. Efficacy was determined by measuring tumor growth and survival times. We observed that individual tumors display disparate growth rates that preclude averaging within a treatment modality indicating heterogeneity of growth rate. We further show that a statistic and stochastic approach must be used when comparing the effect of an anti-cancer therapy on a cohort of tumors. Radiovirotherapy improves therapeutic value over virotherapy alone by slowing the rate of tumor growth in a more substantial manner leading to an increase in survival time. We also show that the radioiodine doses needed to achieve this increase scaled well within the current doses used for treatment of thyroid cancer in humans.
22486511	Structural analysis of MHC alleles in an RSV tumour regression chicken using a BAC library.	2012	Anim Genet	The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC-B locus) has a strong association with resistance and susceptibility to numerous diseases. We have found a B haplotype designated WLA that associated with the regression of tumours caused by Rous sarcoma virus J strain (RSV-J). Haplotype WLA was identical to the regressive B6 haplotype when partial genotyping was performed (Poultry Science, 89, 2010, 651). We then constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from a WLA homozygote chicken to evaluate the structure of this regression haplotype and compared it to those of the B6 haplotype. Comparison between WLA and B6 above 59 kb within the 167 kb, including 14 genes from BG1 to BF2, revealed 75 SNPs and 14 indels. However, several genes were identical between WLA and B6, including the BF1 and BF2 genes, which encode a class I molecule previously suggested to be related to the regression phenotype. The BLB2 gene encoding the MHC class II beta chain showed the greatest diversity, with 19 non-synonymous SNPs. A comparison of WLA and B6 haplotpyes that are associated with tumour regression and RIRa and B24 haplotypes associated with tumour progression suggests that DMA1, DMA2, BRD2, TAPBP and BLB2 genes are not involved in the intensity of RSV J tumour regression.
22385204	In Vivo modulation of the innate response to pneumovirus by type-I and -III interferon-induced Bos taurus Mx1.	2012	J Interferon Cytokine Res	The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major pathogen of the human species. This pneumovirus is a prominent cause of airway morbidity in children and maintains an excessive hospitalization rate despite decades of research. As involvement of a genetic vulnerability is a possibility supported by recent data, we addressed the question of whether the Mx gene products, the typical target of which consists in single-stranded negative-polarity RNA viruses, could alter the course of pneumovirus-associated disease in vivo. Wild-type and Bos taurus Mx1-expressing transgenic FVB/J mice were inoculated with the mouse counterpart and closest phylogenetic relative of RSV, pneumonia virus of mice. Survival data and follow-up of body weight, histological scores, lung virus spread, and lung viral load unequivocally showed that the viral infection was severely repressed in Mx-transgenic mice, thus suggesting that pneumoviruses belong to the antiviral spectrum of mammalian Mx GTPases. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level could reveal critical information for the development of new anti-RSV molecules.
22215662	Independent structural domains in paramyxovirus polymerase protein.	2012	J Biol Chem	All enzymatic activities required for genomic replication and transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses (or Mononegavirales) are believed to be concentrated in the viral polymerase (L) protein. However, our insight into the organization of these different enzymatic activities into a bioactive tertiary structure remains rudimentary. Fragments of Mononegavirales polymerases analyzed to date cannot restore bioactivity through trans-complementation, unlike the related L proteins of segmented NSVs. We investigated the domain organization of phylogenetically diverse Paramyxovirus L proteins derived from measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Through a comprehensive in silico and experimental analysis of domain intersections, we defined MeV L position 615 as an interdomain candidate in addition to the previously reported residue 1708. Only position 1708 of MeV and the homologous positions in NiV and RSV L also tolerated the insertion of epitope tags. Splitting of MeV L at residue 1708 created fragments that were unable to physically interact and trans-complement, but strikingly, these activities were reconstituted by the addition of dimerization tags to the fragments. Equivalently split fragments of NiV, RSV, and MeV L oligomerized with comparable efficiency in all homo- and heterotypic combinations, but only the homotypic pairs were able to trans-complement. These results demonstrate that synthesis as a single polypeptide is not required for the Mononegavirales polymerases to adopt a proper tertiary conformation. Paramyxovirus polymerases are composed of at least two truly independent folding domains that lack a traditional interface but require molecular compatibility for bioactivity. The functional probing of the L domain architecture through trans-complementation is anticipated to be applicable to all Mononegavirales polymerases.
22888294	Molecular evolution of the ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase gene in Oryzeae.	2012	Genet Mol Biol	We surveyed the substitution patterns in the ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) gene in 11 species of Oryzeae with an outgroup in the Ehrhartoidaea. The synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates showed a high positive correlation with each other, but were negatively correlated with codon usage bias and GC content at third codon positions. The substitution rate was heterogenous among lineages. Likelihood-ratio tests showed that the non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio changed significantly among lineages. Site-specific models provided no evidence for positive selection of particular amino acid sites in any codon of the KAO gene. This finding suggested that the significant rate heterogeneity among some lineages may have been caused by variability in the relaxation of the selective constraint among lineages or by neutral processes.
21892730	Functional features of a single chromosome arm in wheat (1AL) determined from its structure.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops globally and a high priority for genetic improvement, but its large and complex genome has been seen as intractable to whole genome sequencing. Isolation of individual wheat chromosome arms has facilitated large-scale sequence analyses. However, so far there is no such survey of sequences from the A genome of wheat. Greater understanding of an A chromosome could facilitate wheat improvement and future sequencing of the entire genome. We have constructed BAC library from the long arm of T. aestivum chromosome 1A (1AL) and obtained BAC end sequences from 7,470 clones encompassing the arm. We obtained 13,445 (89.99%) useful sequences with a cumulative length of 7.57 Mb, representing 1.43% of 1AL and about 0.14% of the entire A genome. The GC content of the sequences was 44.7%, and 90% of the chromosome was estimated to comprise repeat sequences, while just over 1% encoded expressed genes. From the sequence data, we identified a large number of sites suitable for development of molecular markers (362 SSR and 6,948 ISBP) which will have utility for mapping this chromosome and for marker assisted breeding. From 44 putative ISBP markers tested 23 (52.3%) were found to be useful. The BAC end sequence data also enabled the identification of genes and syntenic blocks specific to chromosome 1AL, suggesting regions of particular functional interest and targets for future research.
23573038	Aerobic rice genotypes displayed greater adaptation to water-limited cultivation and tolerance to polyethyleneglycol-6000 induced stress.	2012	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Water scarcity and drought have seriously threatened traditional rice cultivation practices in several parts of the world including India. In the present investigation, experiments were conducted to see if the water-efficient aerobic rice genotypes developed at UAS, Bangalore (MAS25, MAS26 and MAS109) and IRRI, Philippines (MASARB25 and MASARB868), are endowed with drought tolerance or not. A set of these aerobic and five lowland high-yielding (HKR47 and PAU201, Taraori Basmati, Pusa1121 and Pusa1460) indica rice genotypes were evaluated for: (i) yield and yield components under submerged and aerobic conditions in field, (ii) root morphology and biomass under aerobic conditions in pots in the nethouse, (iii) PEG-6000 (0, -1, -2 and -3 bar) induced drought stress at vegetative stage using a hydroponic culture system and (iv) polymorphism for three SSR markers associated with drought resistance traits. Under submerged conditions, the yield of aerobic rice genotypes declined by 13.4-20.1 % whereas under aerobic conditions the yield of lowland indica/Basmati rice varieties declined by 23-27 %. Under water-limited conditions in pots, aerobic rice genotypes had 54-73.8 % greater root length and 18-60 % higher fresh root biomass compared to lowland indica rice varieties. Notably, root length of MASARB25 was 35 % shorter than MAS25 whereas fresh and dry root biomass of MASARB25 was 10 % and 64 % greater than MAS25. The lowland indica were more sensitive to PEG-stress with a score of 5.9-7.6 for Basmati and 6.1-6.7 for non-aromatic indica rice varieties, than the aerobic rice genotypes (score 2.7-3.3). A set of three microsatellite DNA markers (RM212, RM302 and RM3825) located on chromosome 1 which has been shown to be associated with drought resistance was investigated in the present study. Two of these markers (RM212 and RM302) amplified a specific allele in all the aerobic rice genotypes which were absent in lowland indica rice genotypes.
22907502	Specialized technologies for epigenetics in plants.	2012	Methods Mol Biol	Plants are excellent systems for discovering and studying epigenetic phenomena, such as transposon silencing, RNAi, imprinting, and DNA methylation. Imprinting, referring to preferential expression of maternal or paternal alleles, plays an important role in reproduction development of both mammals and plants. DNA methylation is critical for determining whether the maternal or paternal alleles of an imprinted gene is expressed or silenced. In flowering plants, there is a double fertilization event in reproduction: one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to form embryo and a second sperm fuses with the central cell to give rise to endosperm. Endosperm is the tissue where imprinting occurs in plants. MEDEA (MEA), a SET domain Polycomb group gene, was the first plant gene shown to be imprinted in endosperm, and its maternal expression is controlled by DNA methylation and demethylation. Recently there has been significant progress in identifying imprinted genes as well as understanding molecular mechanisms of imprinting in plants. Up to date, approximately 350 genes were found to have differential parent-of-origin expression in plant endosperm (Arabidopsis, corn, and rice). In Arabidopsis, many imprinted genes are regulated by the DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) and the DNA-demethylating glycosylase DEMETER (DME), and/or their chromatin states regulated by Polycomb group proteins (PRC2). There are also maternally expressed genes regulated by unknown mechanisms in endosperm. In this protocol, we describe in detail how to perform a genetic cross, isolate the endosperm tissue from seed, determine the imprinting status of a gene, and analyze DNA methylation of imprinted genes by bisulfite sequencing in Arabidopsis.
22012076	Agave tequilana MADS genes show novel expression patterns in meristems, developing bulbils and floral organs.	2012	Sex Plant Reprod	Agave tequilana is a monocarpic perennial species that flowers after 5-8 years of vegetative growth signaling the end of the plant's life cycle. When fertilization is unsuccessful, vegetative bulbils are induced on the umbels of the inflorescence near the bracteoles from newly formed meristems. Although the regulation of inflorescence and flower development has been described in detail for monocarpic annuals and polycarpic species, little is known at the molecular level for these processes in monocarpic perennials, and few studies have been carried out on bulbils. Histological samples revealed the early induction of umbel meristems soon after the initiation of the vegetative to inflorescence transition in A. tequilana. To identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of floral induction, a search for MADS-box transcription factor ESTs was conducted using an A. tequilana transcriptome database. Seven different MIKC MADS genes classified into 6 different types were identified based on previously characterized A. thaliana and O. sativa MADS genes and sequences from non-grass monocotyledons. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the seven candidate MADS genes in vegetative, inflorescence, bulbil and floral tissues uncovered novel patterns of expression for some of the genes in comparison with orthologous genes characterized in other species. In situ hybridization studies using two different genes showed expression in specific tissues of vegetative meristems and floral buds. Distinct MADS gene regulatory patterns in A. tequilana may be related to the specific reproductive strategies employed by this species.
22539437	Differential regulation of aquaporins, small GTPases and V-ATPases proteins in rice leaves subjected to drought stress and recovery.	2012	Proteomics	Mechanisms of drought tolerance are complex, interacting, and polygenic. This paper describes patterns of gene expression at precise physiological stages of drought in 35-day-old seedlings of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare. Drought was imposed gradually for up to 15 days, causing abscisic acid levels to rise and growth to cease, and plants were then re-watered. Proteins were identified from leaf samples after moderate drought, extreme drought, and 3 and 6 days of re-watering. Label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics resulted in identification of 1548 non-redundant proteins. More proteins were down-regulated in early stages of drought but more were up-regulated as severe drought developed. After re-watering, there was notable down regulation, suggesting that stress-related proteins were being degraded. Proteins involved in signalling and transport became dominant as severe drought took hold but decreased again on re-watering. Most of the nine aquaporins identified were responsive to drought, with six decreasing rapidly in abundance as plants were re-watered. Nine G-proteins appeared in large amounts during severe drought and dramatically degraded once plants were re-watered. We speculate that water transport and drought signalling are critical elements of the overall response to drought in rice and might be the key to biotechnological approaches to drought tolerance.
23093940	The respiratory syncytial virus polymerase has multiple RNA synthesis activities at the promoter.	2012	PLoS Pathog	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an RNA virus in the Family Paramyxoviridae. Here, the activities performed by the RSV polymerase when it encounters the viral antigenomic promoter were examined. RSV RNA synthesis was reconstituted in vitro using recombinant, isolated polymerase and an RNA oligonucleotide template representing nucleotides 1-25 of the trailer complement (TrC) promoter. The RSV polymerase was found to have two RNA synthesis activities, initiating RNA synthesis from the +3 site on the promoter, and adding a specific sequence of nucleotides to the 3' end of the TrC RNA using a back-priming mechanism. Examination of viral RNA isolated from RSV infected cells identified RNAs initiated at the +3 site on the TrC promoter, in addition to the expected +1 site, and showed that a significant proportion of antigenome RNAs contained specific nucleotide additions at the 3' end, demonstrating that the observations made in vitro reflected events that occur during RSV infection. Analysis of the impact of the 3' terminal extension on promoter activity indicated that it can inhibit RNA synthesis initiation. These findings indicate that RSV polymerase-promoter interactions are more complex than previously thought and suggest that there might be sophisticated mechanisms for regulating promoter activity during infection.
22728068	pLR: a lentiviral backbone series to stable transduction of bicistronic genes and exchange of promoters.	2012	Plasmid	Gene transfer based on lentiviral vectors allow the integration of exogenous genes into the genome of a target cell, turning these vectors into one of the most used methods for stable transgene expression in mammalian cells, in vitro and in vivo. Currently, there are no lentivectors that allow the cloning of different genes to be regulated by different promoters. Also, there are none that permit the analysis of the expression through an IRES (internal ribosome entry site)-- reporter gene system. In this work, we have generated a series of lentivectors containing: (1) a malleable structure to allow the cloning of different target genes in a multicloning site (mcs); (2) unique site to exchange promoters, and (3) IRES followed by one of two reporter genes: eGFP or DsRed. The series of the produced vectors were named pLR (for lentivirus and RSV promoter) and were fairly efficient with a strong fluorescence of the reporter genes in direct transfection and viral transduction experiments. This being said, the pLR series have been found to be powerful biotechnological tools for stable gene transfer and expression.
24082492	Variations of antioxidative responses in two rice cultivars with polyamine treatment under salinity stress.	2012	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	The rice varieties viz. Nonabokra and Swarna were evaluated on the basis of their responses for oxidative stress induced by sodium chloride (NaCl) and the effects of exogenously applied polyamine thereon. Rice seedlings were treated with 200 mM of NaCl supplemented with two dosages: 1 mM and 2 mM putrescine. Following treatments, plants were evaluated for accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like O2 (-), H2O2 etc. in tissues, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, accumulation of flavonoids and anthocyanin, activities of different oxidative enzymes like guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR). Preliminary, oxidative stress out of salinity was ensured by plants from significantly higher accumulation of O2 (-) and H2O2 in the tissues of the NaCl treated varieties. Irrespective of varieties, there recorded a significant variation of the endogenous polyamine profiles under NaCl stress. Interestingly, exogenous application of putrescine had a close relationship on O2 (-) and H2O2 content for both the varieties. However, Nonabokra was evident as more respondent than Swarna to applied putrescine. The other effects of oxidative stress was impacted on plants as higher values of MDA content, enhanced rate of protein oxidation and putrescine recorded as an alleviating agent regardless of varieties with dose dependant manner. The generation of ROS and cellular disintegration was accompanied by up regulation of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidation pathways with exogenous application of putrescine. For non-enzymatic antioxidant, it revealed that putrescine was highly effective for sustaining the anthocyanin and flavonoid content in both the varieties under salinity. Whereas, antioxidative enzyme, CAT showed its diminished activity; but activity of GPX and GR were significantly induced under salinity and it was according to the concentration of applied putrescine.
21979254	Purification of human respiratory syncytial virus fusion glycoprotein.	2012	Protein Expr Purif	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion glycoprotein (F) elicits neutralizing antibodies to RSV and has therefore attracted much attention as a suitable candidate antigen in the development of gene-based vaccines against RSV infections. However, a major obstacle in vaccine development has been the problem of antigen purification. To address this problem, we have developed a new method that combines sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and a two-step chromatographic process, to purify RSV F from RSV particles propagated in HEp-2 cells. Analysis of the fractions produced using this method showed recovery of a functional homodimer with a molecular weight of 140 kDa, and 54% preservation of the original F.
22927822	Abc3-mediated efflux of an endogenous digoxin-like steroidal glycoside by Magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for host invasion during blast disease.	2012	PLoS Pathog	Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes the devastating rice-blast disease, invades its host plants via a specialized infection structure called the appressorium. Previously, we showed that the ATP-Binding Cassette 3 transporter is necessary for appressorial function (host penetration) in M. oryzae. However, thus far, the molecular basis underlying impaired appressorial function in the abc3Δ remains elusive. We hypothesized that the abc3Δ appressoria accumulate excessive amounts of specific efflux substrate(s) of the Abc3 transporter in M. oryzae. We devised an innovative yeast-based strategy and identified Abc3 Transporter efflux Substrate (ATS) to be a digoxin-like endogenous steroidal glycoside that accumulates to inhibitory levels in M. oryzae abc3Δ appressoria. Exogenous ATS altered cell wall biogenesis and viability in wild-type Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but not in S. pombe expressing M. oryzae Abc3. We show that ATS associates with the Translation Elongation factor Tef2 in M. oryzae, and propose that ATS regulates ion homeostasis during pathogenesis. Excessive ATS accumulation, either intracellularly due to impaired efflux in the abc3Δ or when added exogenously to the wild type, renders M. oryzae nonpathogenic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the host penetration defects in the abc3Δ are due to aberrant F-actin dynamics as a result of altered Tef2 function and/or ion homeostasis defects caused by excess accumulation of ATS therein. Rather surprisingly, excessive exogenous ATS or digoxin elicited the hypersensitive response in rice, even in the absence of the blast fungus. Lastly, reduced disease symptoms in the inoculated host plants in the presence of excessive digoxin suggest a potential use for such related steroidal glycosides in controlling rice-blast disease.
22239253	Overexpression of miR156 in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) results in various morphological alterations and leads to improved biomass production.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been developed into a dedicated herbaceous bioenergy crop. Biomass yield is a major target trait for genetic improvement of switchgrass. microRNAs have emerged as a prominent class of gene regulatory factors that has the potential to improve complex traits such as biomass yield. A miR156b precursor was overexpressed in switchgrass. The effects of miR156 overexpression on SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) genes were revealed by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Morphological alterations, biomass yield, saccharification efficiency and forage digestibility of the transgenic plants were characterized. miR156 controls apical dominance and floral transition in switchgrass by suppressing its target SPL genes. Relatively low levels of miR156 overexpression were sufficient to increase biomass yield while producing plants with normal flowering time. Moderate levels of miR156 led to improved biomass but the plants were non-flowering. These two groups of plants produced 58%-101% more biomass yield compared with the control. However, high miR156 levels resulted in severely stunted growth. The degree of morphological alterations of the transgenic switchgrass depends on miR156 level. Compared with floral transition, a lower miR156 level is required to disrupt apical dominance. The improvement in biomass yield was mainly because of the increase in tiller number. Targeted overexpression of miR156 also improved solubilized sugar yield and forage digestibility, and offered an effective approach for transgene containment.
22675274	Structure and functional analysis of the RNA- and viral phosphoprotein-binding domain of respiratory syncytial virus M2-1 protein.	2012	PLoS Pathog	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) protein M2-1 functions as an essential transcriptional cofactor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex by increasing polymerase processivity. M2-1 is a modular RNA binding protein that also interacts with the viral phosphoprotein P, another component of the RdRp complex. These binding properties are related to the core region of M2-1 encompassing residues S58 to K177. Here we report the NMR structure of the RSV M2-1(58-177) core domain, which is structurally homologous to the C-terminal domain of Ebola virus VP30, a transcription co-factor sharing functional similarity with M2-1. The partial overlap of RNA and P interaction surfaces on M2-1(58-177), as determined by NMR, rationalizes the previously observed competitive behavior of RNA versus P. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified eight residues located on these surfaces that are critical for an efficient transcription activity of the RdRp complex. Single mutations of these residues disrupted specifically either P or RNA binding to M2-1 in vitro. M2-1 recruitment to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are regarded as sites of viral RNA synthesis, was impaired by mutations affecting only binding to P, but not to RNA, suggesting that M2-1 is associated to the holonucleocapsid by interacting with P. These results reveal that RNA and P binding to M2-1 can be uncoupled and that both are critical for the transcriptional antitermination function of M2-1.
21933120	Molecular determinants that convert hormone sensitive lipase into gibberellin receptor.	2012	Protein Pept Lett	Gibberellins (GAs) are tetracyclic, diterpenoid plant hormones, essential for many developmental processes in higher plants. Plants perceive GA through a nuclear-localized GA receptor, GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1). From sequence similarity, it is suggested that GID1 evolved from a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and recent x-ray crystallography of the GA-GID1 complex has given insights into how GID1 recognizes GA. Analyses of the GA signaling pathway in several plant species further suggest that the GID1-mediated GA signaling pathway emerged in the vascular plant lineage and since then regulation of GA recognition specificity seems to have been fine tuned to strictly regulate the on-off GA signal.
22927818	Surface α-1,3-glucan facilitates fungal stealth infection by interfering with innate immunity in plants.	2012	PLoS Pathog	Plants evoke innate immunity against microbial challenges upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as fungal cell wall chitin. Nevertheless, pathogens may circumvent the host PAMP-triggered immunity. We previously reported that the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae, a famine-causing rice pathogen, masks cell wall surfaces with α-1,3-glucan during invasion. Here, we show that the surface α-1,3-glucan is indispensable for the successful infection of the fungus by interfering with the plant's defense mechanisms. The α-1,3-glucan synthase gene MgAGS1 was not essential for infectious structure development but was required for infection in M. oryzae. Lack or degradation of surface α-1,3-glucan increased fungal susceptibility towards chitinase, suggesting the protective role of α-1,3-glucan against plants' antifungal enzymes during infection. Furthermore, rice plants secreting bacterial α-1,3-glucanase (AGL-rice) showed strong resistance not only to M. oryzae but also to the phylogenetically distant ascomycete Cochlioborus miyabeanus and the polyphagous basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani; the histocytochemical analysis of the latter two revealed that α-1,3-glucan also concealed cell wall chitin in an infection-specific manner. Treatment with α-1,3-glucanase in vitro caused fragmentation of infectious hyphae in R. solani but not in M. oryzae or C. miyabeanus, indicating that α-1,3-glucan is also involved in maintaining infectious structures in some fungi. Importantly, rapid defense responses were evoked (a few hours after inoculation) in the AGL-rice inoculated with M. oryzae, C. miyabeanus and R. solani as well as in non-transgenic rice inoculated with the ags1 mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that α-1,3-glucan protected the fungal cell wall from degradative enzymes secreted by plants even from the pre-penetration stage and interfered with the release of PAMPs to delay innate immune defense responses. Because α-1,3-glucan is nondegradable in plants, it is reasonable that many fungal plant pathogens utilize α-1,3-glucan in the innate immune evasion mechanism and some in maintaining the structures.
22312005	Siliques are Red1 from Arabidopsis acts as a bidirectional amino acid transporter that is crucial for the amino acid homeostasis of siliques.	2012	Plant Physiol	Many membrane proteins are involved in the transport of nutrients in plants. While the import of amino acids into plant cells is, in principle, well understood, their export has been insufficiently described. Here, we present the identification and characterization of the membrane protein Siliques Are Red1 (SIAR1) from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that is able to translocate amino acids bidirectionally into as well as out of the cell. Analyses in yeast and oocytes suggest a SIAR1-mediated export of amino acids. In Arabidopsis, SIAR1 localizes to the plasma membrane and is expressed in the vascular tissue, in the pericycle, in stamen, and in the chalazal seed coat of ovules and developing seeds. Mutant alleles of SIAR1 accumulate anthocyanins as a symptom of reduced amino acid content in the early stages of silique development. Our data demonstrate that the SIAR1-mediated export of amino acids plays an important role in organic nitrogen allocation and particularly in amino acid homeostasis in developing siliques.
22453776	A genome-wide comparison of NB-LRR type of resistance gene analogs (RGA) in the plant kingdom.	2012	Mol Cells	Plants express resistance (R) genes to recognize invaders and prevent the spread of pathogens. To analyze nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) genes, we constructed a fast pipeline to predict and classify the R gene analogs (RGAs) by applying in-house matrices. With predicted ~37,000 RGAs, we can directly compare RGA contents across entire plant lineages, from green algae to flowering plants. We focused on the highly divergent NBLRRs in land plants following the emergence of mosses. We identified entire loss of Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor, NBLRR (TNL) in Poaceae family of monocots and interestingly from Mimulus guttatus (a dicot), which leads to the possibility of species-specific TNL loss in other sequenced flowering plants. Using RGA maps, we have elucidated a positive correlation between the cluster sizes of NB-LRRs and their numbers. The cluster members were observed to consist of the same class of NB-LRRs or their variants, which were probably generated from a single locus for an R gene. Our website ( http://sol.kribb.re.kr/PRGA/ ), called plant resistance gene analog (PRGA), provides useful information, such as RGA annotations, tools for predicting RGAs, and analyzing domain profiles. Therefore, PRGA provides new insights into R-gene evolution and is useful in applying RGA as markers in breeding and or systematic studies.
21818852	Genetic, proteomic and metabolic analysis of the regulation of energy storage in rice seedlings in response to drought.	2011	Proteomics	We used proteomic analysis to determine the response of rice plant seedlings to drought-induced stress. The expression of 71 protein spots was significantly altered, and 60 spots were successfully identified. The greatest down-regulated protein functional category was translation. Up-regulated proteins were mainly related to protein folding and assembly. Additionally, many proteins involved in metabolism (e.g. carbohydrate metabolism) also showed differences in expression. cDNA microarray and GC-MS analysis showed 4756 differentially expressed mRNAs and 37 differentially expressed metabolites. Once these data were integrated with the proteomic analysis, we were able to elucidate the metabolic pathways affected by drought-induced stress. These results suggest that increased energy consumption from storage substances occurred during drought. In addition, increased expression of the enzymes involved in anabolic pathways corresponded with an increase in the content of six amino acids. We speculated that energy conversion from carbohydrates and/or fatty acids to amino acids was increased. Analysis of basic metabolism networks allowed us to understand how rice plants adjust to drought conditions.
24279910	Glabrous Rice 1, encoding a homeodomain protein, regulates trichome development in rice.	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Glabrous rice, which lacks trichomes on the rice epidermis, is regarded as an important germplasm resource in rice breeding. Trichomes are derived from aerial epidermal cells and used as a model to study the cell fate determination in plant. In Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanisms of trichome development have been well studied. However, little is known about the molecular basis of trichome development in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, near isogenic lines harboring the glabrous rice 1 locus were developed. By a map-based approach, we narrowed down the locus to a 21-kb DNA region harboring two genes. One of the genes named Glabrous Rice 1 (GLR1), which is most likely the candidate, encodes a homeodomain protein containing the WOX motif. Constitutive Expression of GLR1 could partially complement the glabrous phenotype of NILglr1. The knock down of GLR1 by RNA interference led to a significant decrease in trichome number on the leaves and glumes of the RNAi transgenic plants.

CONCLUSION: GLR1 plays an important role in rice trichome development and will contribute to breeding of glabrous elite rice varieties.
24280025	Heritable alteration in salt-tolerance in rice induced by introgression from wild rice (Zizania latifolia).	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Introgression as a means of generating phenotypic novelty, including altered stress tolerance, is increasingly being recognized as common. The underlying basis for de novo genesis of phenotypic variation in the introgression lines remains largely unexplored. In this investigation, we used a rice line (RZ35) derived from introgressive hybridization between rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.), along with its rice parental line (cv. Matsumae) as the experimental materials. We compared effects of salt stress on growth, ion homeostasis, and relevant gene expression between RZ35 and Matsumae, to explore possible mechanisms of heritable alteration in stress tolerance induced by the introgression.

RESULTS: Contrary to our expectation, the results showed that the inhibitory effect of salt stress on growth of RZ35 was significantly greater than that of Matsumae. We further found that a major underlying cause for this outcome is that the introgression process weakened the capacity in Na+ exclusion under the salt stress condition, and hence, escalated the injuries of Na+ and Cl- in shoots of RZ35. Accordingly, based on q-RT-PCR analysis, four genes known to be involved in the Na+ exclusion, i.e., OsHKT1;5, OsSOS1, OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4, were found to be significantly down-regulated in roots of RZ35 relative to its rice parental line under the salt stress condition, thus implicating a gene expression regulation-based molecular mechanism underlying the difference in salt stress-tolerance between the introgression line and its rice parental line.

CONCLUSIONS: We show that introgression represents a potent means for rapidly generating de novo heritable variations in physiological traits like stress tolerance in plants, although the direction of the alteration appears unpredictable.
22844430	Pharyngeal microflora disruption by antibiotics promotes airway hyperresponsiveness after respiratory syncytial virus infection.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Treg cells), which are essential for regulation of immune response to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, are promoted by pharyngeal commensal pneumococcus. The effects of pharyngeal microflora disruption by antibiotics on airway responsiveness and relative immune responses after RSV infection have not been clarified.

METHODS: Female BALB/c mice (aged 3 weeks) were infected with RSV and then treated with either oral antibiotics or oral double distilled water (ddH(2)O) from 1 d post infection (pi). Changes in pharyngeal microflora were analyzed after antibiotic treatment for 7 d and 14 d. At 8 d pi and 15 d pi, the inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were investigated in combination with tests of pulmonary histopathology, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), pulmonary and splenic Treg cells responses. Pulmonary Foxp3 mRNA expression, IL-10 and TGF-β1 in BALF and lung homogenate were investigated at 15 d pi. Ovalbumin (OVA) challenge was used to induce AHR after RSV infection.

RESULTS: The predominant pharyngeal commensal, Streptococcus, was cleared by antibiotic treatment for 7 d. Same change also existed after antibiotic treatment for 14 d. After RSV infection, AHR was promoted by antibiotic treatment at 15 d pi. Synchronous decreases of pulmonary Treg cells, Foxp3 mRNA and TGF-β1 were detected. Similar results were observed under OVA challenge.

CONCLUSIONS: After RSV infection, antibiotic treatment cleared pharyngeal commensal bacteria such as Streptococcus, which consequently, might induce AHR and decrease pulmonary Treg cells.
24575232	Regeneration of Transgenic Rice with Bacterial ipt Gene Driven by Senescence Specific (SAG12) Promoter by Particle Bombardment.	2012	Trop Life Sci Res	Transgenic rice plants were generated using particle bombardment to introduce the Agrobacterium cytokinin biosynthesis gene driven by Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) senescence specific promoter (SAG12) for delaying leaf senescence. Using two plasmids we co-transformed one week old embryogenic calli derived from mature Japonica rice (Oryza sativa) variety Chin Guang. The selectable marker hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene and the reporter gene B-ß-glucuronidase (uidA), both under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were placed on the same co-integrate vector whereas the cytokinin biosynthesis gene, isopentenyl transferase (ipt) driven by the SAG12 promoter is supplied in another plasmid. A total of 32 transgenic rice plants were regenerated of which 27 plants were randomly selected for histochemical ß-glucuronidase (GUS) assay, PCR and Southern blot analysis. Co-integration frequencies of 88% and 69% were obtained for two linked genes (uidA and hph) and two unlinked genes (hph and ipt gene) respectively in R0 plants. Southern blot analysis confirmed the results of histochemical GUS assay and PCR amplifications. A complex integration pattern for all the transgenes including the multiple copies integration was predominantly observed.
24279714	Enhanced saccharification of rice straw by overexpression of rice exo-glucanase.	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Efficient production of carbon-neutral biofuels is key to resolving global warming and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Cellulose, which is the most abundant biomass, is physically strong and biochemically stable, and these characteristics lead to difficulty of efficient saccharification of cellulosic compounds for production of fermentable glucose and other sugars.

RESULTS: We transformed rice with overexpressing constructs of rice genes encoding each of three classes of cellulases. The exo-glucanase overexpressing plants showed various abnormalities in leaf such as division of leaf blade, crack on leaf surface, excess lacunae in midrib structure and necrotic colour change. The overexpressing plants also showed sterility. Noticeably, these plants showed enhanced saccharification of stems after maturation. These results indicate that overexpression of the exo-glucanase gene brought about various developmental defects associated with modification of cell wall and enhanced saccharification in rice. On the other hand, endo-glucanase-overexpressing plants could not be obtained, and overexpression of β-glucosidase brought about no effect on plant growth and development.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that genetic engineering of cellulosic biomass plants by overexpressing cellulase genes will be one of the approaches to confer enhanced saccharification ability for efficient production of cellulosic biofuels such as ethanol.
24280046	Narrowing down the targets for yield improvement in rice under normal and abiotic stress conditions via expression profiling of yield-related genes.	2012	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Crop improvement targeting high yield and tolerance to environmental stresses has become the need of the hour. Yield improvement via breeding or gene pyramiding aiming comprehensive incorporation of the agronomically favored traits requires an in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of these traits. The present study describes expression profiling of yield-related genes in rice with respect to different developmental stages and various abiotic stress conditions.

RESULTS: Our analysis indicates developmental regulation of the yield-related genes pertaining to the genetic reprogramming involved at the corresponding developmental stage. The gene expression data can be utilized to specifically select particular genes which can potentially function synergistically for enhancing the yield while maintaining the source-sink balance. Furthermore, to gain some insights into the molecular basis of yield penalty during various abiotic stresses, the expression of selected yield-related genes has also been analyzed by qRT-PCR under such stress conditions. Our analysis clearly showed a tight transcriptional regulation of a few of these yield-related genes by abiotic stresses. The stress-responsive expression patterns of these genes could explain some of the most important stress-related physiological manifestations such as reduced tillering, smaller panicles and early completion of the life cycle owing to reduced duration of vegetative and reproductive phases.

CONCLUSIONS: Development of high yielding rice varieties which maintain their yield even under stress conditions may be achieved by simultaneous genetic manipulation of certain combination of genes such as LRK1 and LOG, based on their function and expression profile obtained in the present study. Our study would aid in investigating in future, whether over-expressing or knocking down such yield-related genes can improve the grain yield potential in rice.
23285210	Clonal expansion and emergence of environmental multiple-triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus strains carrying the TR₃₄/L98H mutations in the cyp51A gene in India.	2012	PLoS One	Azole resistance is an emerging problem in Aspergillus which impacts the management of aspergillosis. Here in we report the emergence and clonal spread of resistance to triazoles in environmental Aspergillus fumigatus isolates in India. A total of 44 (7%) A. fumigatus isolates from 24 environmental samples were found to be triazole resistant. The isolation rate of resistant A. fumigatus was highest (33%) from soil of tea gardens followed by soil from flower pots of the hospital garden (20%), soil beneath cotton trees (20%), rice paddy fields (12.3%), air samples of hospital wards (7.6%) and from soil admixed with bird droppings (3.8%). These strains showed cross-resistance to voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole and to six triazole fungicides used extensively in agriculture. Our analyses identified that all triazole-resistant strains from India shared the same TR(34)/L98H mutation in the cyp51 gene. In contrast to the genetic uniformity of azole-resistant strains the azole-susceptible isolates from patients and environments in India were genetically very diverse. All nine loci were highly polymorphic in populations of azole-susceptible isolates from both clinical and environmental samples. Furthermore, all Indian environmental and clinical azole resistant isolates shared the same multilocus microsatellite genotype not found in any other analyzed samples, either from within India or from the Netherlands, France, Germany or China. Our population genetic analyses suggest that the Indian azole-resistant A. fumigatus genotype was likely an extremely adaptive recombinant progeny derived from a cross between an azole-resistant strain migrated from outside of India and a native azole-susceptible strain from within India, followed by mutation and then rapid dispersal through many parts of India. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure of A. fumigatus to azole fungicides in the environment causes cross-resistance to medical triazoles. The study emphasises the need of continued surveillance of resistance in environmental and clinical A. fumigatus strains.
23300622	Structural insights into cellulolytic and chitinolytic enzymes revealing crucial residues of insect β-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase.	2012	PLoS One	The chemical similarity of cellulose and chitin supports the idea that their corresponding hydrolytic enzymes would bind β-1,4-linked glucose residues in a similar manner. A structural and mutational analysis was performed for the plant cellulolytic enzyme BGlu1 from Oryza sativa and the insect chitinolytic enzyme OfHex1 from Ostrinia furnacalis. Although BGlu1 shows little amino-acid sequence or topological similarity with OfHex1, three residues (Trp(490), Glu(328), Val(327) in OfHex1, and Trp(358), Tyr(131) and Ile(179) in BGlu1) were identified as being conserved in the +1 sugar binding site. OfHex1 Glu(328) together with Trp(490) was confirmed to be necessary for substrate binding. The mutant E328A exhibited a 8-fold increment in K(m) for (GlcNAc)(2) and a 42-fold increment in K(i) for TMG-chitotriomycin. A crystal structure of E328A in complex with TMG-chitotriomycin was resolved at 2.5 Å, revealing the obvious conformational changes of the catalytic residues (Glu(368) and Asp(367)) and the absence of the hydrogen bond between E328A and the C3-OH of the +1 sugar. V327G exhibited the same activity as the wild-type, but acquired the ability to efficiently hydrolyse β-1,2-linked GlcNAc in contrast to the wild-type. Thus, Glu(328) and Val(327) were identified as important for substrate-binding and as glycosidic-bond determinants. A structure-based sequence alignment confirmed the spatial conservation of these three residues in most plant cellulolytic, insect and bacterial chitinolytic enzymes.
22389685	Etiology and clinical characterization of respiratory virus infections in adult patients attending an emergency department in Beijing.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a serious global health burden. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1-3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (<3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses.

CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses.
22952830	Extensive pyrosequencing reveals frequent intra-genomic variations of internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) is already one of the most popular phylogenetic and DNA barcoding markers. However, the existence of its multiple copies has complicated such usage and a detailed characterization of intra-genomic variations is critical to address such concerns.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we used sequence-tagged pyrosequencing and genome-wide analyses to characterize intra-genomic variations of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions from 178 plant species. We discovered that mutation of ITS2 is frequent, with a mean of 35 variants per species. And on average, three of the most abundant variants make up 91% of all ITS2 copies. Moreover, we found different congeneric species share identical variants in 13 genera. Interestingly, different species across different genera also share identical variants. In particular, one minor variant of ITS2 in Eleutherococcus giraldii was found identical to the ITS2 major variant of Panax ginseng, both from Araliaceae family. In addition, DNA barcoding gap analysis showed that the intra-genomic distances were markedly smaller than those of the intra-specific or inter-specific variants. When each of 5543 variants were examined for its species discrimination efficiency, a 97% success rate was obtained at the species level.

CONCLUSIONS: Identification of identical ITS2 variants across intra-generic or inter-generic species revealed complex species evolutionary history, possibly, horizontal gene transfer and ancestral hybridization. Although intra-genomic multiple variants are frequently found within each genome, the usage of the major variants alone is sufficient for phylogeny construction and species determination in most cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of minor variants further improves the resolution of species identification.
22984581	Surveillance and genome analysis of human bocavirus in patients with respiratory infection in Guangzhou, China.	2012	PLoS One	Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus associated with respiratory tract diseases and gastrointestinal illness in adult and pediatric patients throughout the world. To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HBoV in Guangzhou, South China, we screened 3460 throat swab samples from 1686 children and 1774 adults with acute respiratory infection symptoms for HBoV between March 2010 and February 2011, and analyzed the complete genome sequence of 2 HBoV strains. Specimens were screened for HBoV by real-time PCR and other 6 common respiratory viruses by RT-PCR or PCR. HBoV was detected in 58 (1.68%) out of 3460 samples, mostly from pediatric patients (52/58) and inpatient children (47/58). Six adult patients were detected as HBoV positive and 5 were emergency cases. Of these HBoV positive cases, 19 (32.76%) had co-pathogens including influenza virus (n = 5), RSV (n = 5), parainfluenza (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 1), coronavirus (n = 7). The complete genome sequences of 2 HBoVs strains (Genbank no. JN794565 and JN794566) were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 2 HBoV strains were HBoV1, and were most genetically close to ST2 (GenBank accession number DQ0000496). Recombination analysis confirmed that HBoV strain GZ9081 was an intra-genotype recombinant strain among HBoV1 variants.
23029150	Sirtuin 1 facilitates generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts through the miR-34a and p53 pathways.	2012	PLoS One	Forced-expression of transcription factors can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Recent studies show that the reprogramming efficiency can be improved by inclusion of small molecules that regulate chromatin modifying enzymes. We report here that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a member of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, is involved in iPSC formation. By using an efficient mouse secondary fibroblast reprogramming system with doxycycline (DOX) inducible Yamanaka's transcription factors delivered by piggyBac (PB) transposition (2°F/1B MEF), we show that SIRT1 knockdown decreased while resveratrol (RSV) increased the efficiency of iPSC formation. The treatments were associated with altered acetylated p53 and its downstream Nanog but not p21 expression. The stimulatory effect was also confirmed by SIRT1 over-expression, which stimulated the formation of colonies with induced Nanog and reduced p21 expression. Furthermore, the effects of RSV and SIRT1 knockdown on reprogramming were most pronounced during the initiation phase of reprogramming. MicroRNA-34a is a known regulator of SIRT1. Its inhibitor increased, while its mimics reduced iPSC formation. The stimulatory effect of SIRT1 during reprogramming was also confirmed in the primary MEF. RSV increased while tenovin-6, a small molecule that activates p53 through SIRT1 inhibition, suppressed reprogramming. In conclusion, SIRT1 enhances iPSC generation, in part, through deacetylation of p53, inhibition of p21 and enhancement of Nanog expression.
23167196	[Uptake of exogenous sugars and responses by rice root of young wild-type and ospk1 mutant seedlings].	2012	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	How root system responds to various environmental factors has not yet been fully elucidated. In root, the expression of OsPK1 is mainly in the maturation zone and the root-hair zone of root tip. It is unknown whether the uptake of exogenous sugars by rice seedlings is affected by downregulation of OsPK1. In this study, we used wild-type (WT) and ospk1 rice mutant plants to investigate the uptake of exogenous sugars and the responses of rice seedlings by adding sucrose to 1/2 MS medium or not. The contents of sucrose, glucose, fructose and galactose in leaf blades, sheathes and roots of rice seedlings were measured by GC-MS analysis. The result revealed that direct contact between root and exogenous sugars greatly elevates sugar levels of rice seedlings. And the root length of these seedlings is much longer than that of the seedlings grown in medium omitting exogenous sugars, suggesting that uptake of exogenous sugars by root promotes root elongation. Downregulation of OsPK1 has effects on sugar metabolism and the uptake of exogenous sugars. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR result showed that the expressions of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;5 and OsTIP2;1 (three aquaporin genes) in root were greatly upregulated by the direct contact between root and exogenous sugars.
22272223	A novel universal primer-multiplex-PCR method with sequencing gel electrophoresis analysis.	2012	PLoS One	In this study, a novel universal primer-multiplex-PCR (UP-M-PCR) method adding a universal primer (UP) in the multiplex PCR reaction system was described. A universal adapter was designed in the 5'-end of each specific primer pairs which matched with the specific DNA sequences for each template and also used as the universal primer (UP). PCR products were analyzed on sequencing gel electrophoresis (SGE) which had the advantage of exhibiting extraordinary resolution. This method overcame the disadvantages rooted deeply in conventional multiplex PCR such as complex manipulation, lower sensitivity, self-inhibition and amplification disparity resulting from different primers, and it got a high specificity and had a low detection limit of 0.1 ng for single kind of crops when screening the presence of genetically modified (GM) crops in mixture samples. The novel developed multiplex PCR assay with sequencing gel electrophoresis analysis will be useful in many fields, such as verifying the GM status of a sample irrespective of the crop and GM trait and so on.
23136511	Genetic characterization of rainfed upland New Rice for Africa (NERICA) varieties.	2012	Breed Sci	A total of 18 rainfed upland New Rice for Africa (NERICA) varieties were categorized as the heavy panicle and low tillering types and early heading, in compared with 32 different varieties. These chromosome components were clarified using 243 SSR markers which showed polymorphism among NERICA varieties and their parents, CG 14 (O. glaberrima Steud.) and one of the recurrent parents, WAB-56-104 (O. sativa L.). NERICA varieties were classified into three groups, which corresponded with these parents' continuation including two exceptions, NERICAs 14 and 17, by a cluster analysis using polymorphism data of SSR markers and 14 differential markers among them were selected to classify NERICA varieties. However, three groups: NERICAs, 3 and 4, NERICAs, 8, 9 and 11 and NERICAs, 15 and 16 were not distinguishable. Association analysis was carried out for characterization of NERICA varieties by using SSR markers genotype and phenotype of agronomic traits. A total of 131 quantitative trait loci between SSR markers and 11 agronomic traits were detected. The characteristics of early maturity and heavy panicle of upland NERICA varieties were succeeded from Asian rice varieties and the characteristics of high dry matter production and late heading were introduced from CG 14 and the other varieties.
23046655	Genetic and biochemical approaches for studying the yellow stripe-like transporter family in plants.	2012	Curr Top Membr	Iron (Fe) is essential for plants but can be toxic if over-accumulated. Members of the yellow stripe-like (YSL) family of metal transporters play important roles in plant Fe homeostasis, and a great deal of evidence has been gathered over many years that indicates the importance of YSLs in the long distance transport of metals complexed with nicotianamine (NA). This review examines our current knowledge of YSLs, gleaned from both genetic and biochemical approaches. Many unanswered questions remain regarding the substrate specificities of these transporters, which seem to vary widely depending on the individual transporter. Data are also just beginning to become available regarding YSLs in the most basal clade, which may be responsible for intracellular transport of metal-NA complexes. Future research on YSL transporters should focus on utilizing the proven techniques of yeast complementation and Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology to examine the substrate specificity of YSLs in greater detail.
24163954	Influence of sodium selenite on growth, nutrient utilization and selenium uptake in Cavia porcellus.	2012	Pak J Biol Sci	A 70 day experiment on forty guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) was conducted to find the influence of different level of sodium selenite (inorganic selenium supplementation) on growth, nutrient utilization and selenium uptake. The sodium selenite was supplemented into a basal diet at 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 ppm, respectively and the basal diet comprised of 25% ground cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) hay, 30% ground maize (Zea mays) grain, 22% ground gram (Cicer arietinum) grain, 9.5% deoiled rice (Oryza sativa) bran, 6% soybean (Glycine max) meal, 6% fish meal, 1.5% mineral mixture (without Se), ascorbic acid (200 mg kg) and 0.1 ppm Se to meet their nutrient requirements. Daily feed intake and weekly body weights were recorded. Intake and digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, crude fiber and nitrogen-free extract as well as uptake of calcium and phosphorus, total body weight and average daily gain were similar (p>0.05) among the four groups. However, there was a trend of increase in Se absorption of the guinea pigs with the increasing levels of Se, in the groups given 0.2 and 0.3 ppm of Se. It can be concluded that requirement of Se in guinea pigs is 0.1 ppm, as supplementation of > or =0.1 ppm sodium selenite in the diet (having 0.1 ppm Se) did not enhanced their growth rate and nutrient utilization.
19825583	Classification, expression pattern, and E3 ligase activity assay of rice U-box-containing proteins.	2008	Mol Plant	Ubiquitin ligases play a central role in determining the specificity of the ubiquitination system by selecting a myriad of appropriate candidate proteins for modification. The U-box is a recently identified, ubiquitin ligase activity-related protein domain that shows greater presence in plants than in other organisms. In this study, we identified 77 putative U-box proteins from the rice genome using a battery of whole genome analysis algorithms. Most of the U-box protein genes are expressed, as supported by the identification of their corresponding expressed sequence tags (ESTs), full-length cDNAs, or massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) tags. Using the same algorithms, we identified 61 U-box proteins from the Arabidopsis genome. The rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins were classified into nine major classes based on their domain compositions. Comparison between rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins indicates that the majority of rice and Arabidopsis U-box proteins have the same domain organizations. The inferred phylogeny established the homology between rice and Arabidopsis U-box/ARM proteins. Cell death assay using the rice protoplast system suggests that one rice U-box gene, OsPUB51, might act as a negative regulator of cell death signaling. In addition, the selected U-box proteins were found to be functional E3 ubiquitin ligases. The identification and analysis of rice U-box proteins hereby at the genomic level will help functionally characterize this class of E3 ubiquitin ligase in the future.
19021904	Genome-wide and expression analysis of protein phosphatase 2C in rice and Arabidopsis.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) from various organisms have been implicated to act as negative modulators of protein kinase pathways involved in diverse environmental stress responses and developmental processes. A genome-wide overview of the PP2C gene family in plants is not yet available.

RESULTS: A comprehensive computational analysis identified 80 and 78 PP2C genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPP2Cs) and Oryza sativa (OsPP2Cs), respectively, which denotes the PP2C gene family as one of the largest families identified in plants. Phylogenic analysis divided PP2Cs in Arabidopsis and rice into 13 and 11 subfamilies, respectively, which are supported by the analyses of gene structures and protein motifs. Comparative analysis between the PP2C genes in Arabidopsis and rice identified common and lineage-specific subfamilies and potential 'gene birth-and-death' events. Gene duplication analysis reveals that whole genome and chromosomal segment duplications mainly contributed to the expansion of both OsPP2Cs and AtPP2Cs, but tandem or local duplication occurred less frequently in Arabidopsis than rice. Some protein motifs are widespread among the PP2C proteins, whereas some other motifs are specific to only one or two subfamilies. Expression pattern analysis suggests that 1) most PP2C genes play functional roles in multiple tissues in both species, 2) the induced expression of most genes in subfamily A by diverse stimuli indicates their primary role in stress tolerance, especially ABA response, and 3) the expression pattern of subfamily D members suggests that they may constitute positive regulators in ABA-mediated signaling pathways. The analyses of putative upstream regulatory elements by two approaches further support the functions of subfamily A in ABA signaling, and provide insights into the shared and different transcriptional regulation machineries in dicots and monocots.

CONCLUSION: This comparative genome-wide overview of the PP2C family in Arabidopsis and rice provides insights into the functions and regulatory mechanisms, as well as the evolution and divergence of the PP2C genes in dicots and monocots. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that plant PP2C proteins from different subfamilies participate in distinct signaling pathways. Our results have established a solid foundation for future studies on the functional divergence in different PP2C subfamilies.
19109415	A rice kinase-protein interaction map.	2009	Plant Physiol	Plants uniquely contain large numbers of protein kinases, and for the vast majority of the 1,429 kinases predicted in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome, little is known of their functions. Genetic approaches often fail to produce observable phenotypes; thus, new strategies are needed to delineate kinase function. We previously developed a cost-effective high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. Using this system, we have generated a protein interaction map of 116 representative rice kinases and 254 of their interacting proteins. Overall, the resulting interaction map supports a large number of known or predicted kinase-protein interactions from both plants and animals and reveals many new functional insights. Notably, we found a potential widespread role for E3 ubiquitin ligases in pathogen defense signaling mediated by receptor-like kinases, particularly by the kinases that may have evolved from recently expanded kinase subfamilies in rice. We anticipate that the data provided here will serve as a foundation for targeted functional studies in rice and other plants. The application of yeast two-hybrid and TAPtag analyses for large-scale plant protein interaction studies is also discussed.
24280589	Re-sequencing of mitochondrial genes in a standard rice cultivar Nipponbare.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Genomic sequence of a rice cultivar Nipponbare has been often used as a reference sequence since a whole-genomic sequence was first determined in 2005 by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project. As for mitochondrial genomic sequence of Nipponbare, two groups have deposited their sequences into DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers BA000029 and DQ167400. However, there are 19 discrepancies in the nucleotide sequences of 7 genes between BA000029 and DQ167400.

FINDINGS: We performed PCR to amplify these 7 genes and to perform direct sequencing. Nucleotides of the discrepant sites were all identical to those in DQ167400.1. The sequence in BA000029.3 is thought to contain sequencing errors.

CONCLUSION: Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genes in BA000029.3 need to be updated using the data in this study when used as a reference genome.
22137607	Two phenylalanine ammonia lyase isoforms are involved in the elicitor-induced response of rice to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Suspension cultured cells of a blast-resistant rice genotype (Oryza sativa L. cv. Gigante Vercelli) were treated with cell wall hydrolysates prepared from the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. As a consequence, a complex pattern of phenylalanine ammonia lyase time course specific activity levels was evident. Ion-exchange chromatographic fractionation of crude extracts suggested that the early (6 h) and the late (48-72 h after elicitation) increase of activity relied upon the sequential induction of two different isoenzymes. The relative expression levels of 11 genes putatively coding for a phenylalanine ammonia lyase were measured by semi-quantitative capillary gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products. Two genes were indeed found to be induced by treatments with the hydrolysate, and data were validated by real-time PCR. Conversely, only the early-responsive enzyme form was observed following elicitation in a blast-sensitive rice genotype (cv. Vialone nano). Therefore, the late-responsive isoform may represent a candidate gene to select for decreased sensitivity to blast.
18705865	Expression of a bacterial flagellin gene triggers plant immune responses and confers disease resistance in transgenic rice plants.	2008	Mol Plant Pathol	Flagellin is a component of bacterial flagella and acts as a proteinaceous elicitor of defence responses in organisms. Flagellin from a phytopathogenic bacterium, Acidovorax avenae strain N1141, induces immune responses in suspension-cultured rice cells. To analyse the function of flagellin in rice, we fused the N1141 flagellin gene to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and introduced it into rice. Many of the resulting transgenic rice plants accumulated flagellin at various levels. The transgenic rice developed pale spots in the leaves. The expression of a defence-related gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was induced in the transgenic plants, and H(2)O(2) production and cell death were observed in some plants with high levels of gene expression, suggesting that the flagellin triggers immune responses in the transgenic rice. Transgenic plants inoculated with Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast, showed enhanced resistance to blast, suggesting that the flagellin production confers disease resistance in the transgenic rice.
17415624	Rice allelopathy induced by methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate.	2007	J Chem Ecol	Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and methyl salicylate (MeSA) are important signaling molecules that induce plant defense against insect herbivores and microbial pathogens. We tested the hypothesis that allelopathy is an inducible defense mechanism, and that the JA and SA signaling pathways may activate allelochemicals release. Exogenous application of MeJA and MeSA to rice (Oryza sativa L.) enhanced rice allelopathic potential and led to accumulation of phenolics, an increase in enzymatic activities, and gene transcription of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), two key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Aqueous extracts of the leaves of rice IAC165, a putative allelopathic variety, treated with MeSA (5 mM) or MeJA (0.05 mM), showed increased inhibitory effects (25 and 21%, respectively) on root growth of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), and increased inhibitory effects (18 and 23%, respectively) on shoot growth. Aqueous extracts from leaves of Huajingxian 1 rice, a putative nonallelopathic variety treated with MeJA and MeSA, caused 63 and 24% inhibition of root growth in barnyardgrass seedlings. The root exudates of both IAC165 and Huajingxian 1 plants treated with MeJA and MeSA for 48 hr also showed significant increases in their inhibitory effects on root growth of barnyardgrass seedlings. At the four-leaf stage, levels of 3,4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, coumaric acid, and ferulic acid that accumulated in the leaves were 5.3-, 31.3-, 2.2-, and 1.7-fold higher in response to MeJA exposure, and 3.3-, 13.1-, 2.0-, and 2.2-fold higher in response to MeSA. Treatments of MeSA and MeJA enhanced the PAL activity in the rice leaves up to 52.3 and 80.1%, respectively, whereas C4H activity was increased by 40.2 and 67%. Gene transcription of PAL and C4H in rice leaves significantly increased after the plants were subjected to treatment with MeJA and MeSA. These results suggest that allelopathy may be an active defense mechanism, and that plant signaling compounds are potentially valuable in its regulation.
15838683	The ectopic expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase with ectopic accumulation of polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters in internode parenchyma of rice mutant Fukei 71.	2005	Plant Cell Rep	Both polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters (PHEs) and lignin are biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway. In the abnormal internode parenchyma of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant Fukei 71, which has a defective recessive gene (d50), the biosynthesis of lignin and PHEs differs. . The polysaccharide-linked ferulate and p-coumarate have been shown to accumulate to high levels in the irregularly shaped and collapsed internode parenchyma cells of Fukei 71 without an accompanying overaccumulation of lignin as a result of the defective d50 gene. In the present study we demonstrated that in this abnormal parenchyma tissue of Fukei 71 the expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and glutamine synthetase (GS) were ectopically induced with the ectopic accumulation of PHEs, suggesting that the d50 gene may play a role as a controlling element in the biosynthesis of PHEs during cell-wall formation in the grasses.
14714141	Detection of the putative cis-region involved in the induction by a Pyricularia oryzae elicitor of the promoter of a gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Rep	A rice PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) gene sequence ( rPAL-P5), which is highly similar to and likely the same as a previously described rice ZB8PAL gene, including the 5'-upstream and exon I coding regions of PAL, was isolated using PCR amplification. The expression of several PALs, including rPAL-P5, was strongly induced following inoculation with Pyricularia oryzae or treatment with a P. oryzae elicitor. To identify the promoter region induced by the P. oryzae elicitor, we constructed and subsequently transformed rPAL-P5 promoter deletion series into rice calli using particle bombardment. Results from both elicitor-inducible reporter gene and gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the sequence -349 to -256 of the rPAL-P5 promoter includes a cis-element involved in the induction of P. oryzae.
12060286	Overlapping expression of cytosolic glutamine synthetase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in immature leaf blades of rice.	2001	Physiol Plant	In order to estimate whether cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1; EC 6.3.1.2) is partly coupled to the reaction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5) in developing organs of rice (Oryza sativa L.), we compared the expression pattern of transcripts and proteins for GS1 and PAL in the tissue sections from leaf blades at various stages of development. In immature vascular bundles of unexpanded leaf blades, GS1 mRNA was mainly detected in xylem parenchyma cells, mestome-sheath cells, and sclerenchyma cells. PAL transcripts were also accumulated in these cell types. Vascular bundles in midribs of immature leaf blades contained mRNAs and proteins for both GS1 and PAL abundantly in sclerenchyma cells, although distribution of these two proteins was not completely overlapped. In immature vascular bundles in midribs, lignin deposition was observed in cell walls of xylem parenchyma cells, mestome-sheath cells and sclerenchyma cells. These results implied that a part of GS1 in unexpanded leaf blades is possibly involved in reassimilation of ammonia released from PAL reaction during the lignin production.
22243810	A convenient method for simultaneous quantification of multiple phytohormones and metabolites: application in study of rice-bacterium interaction.	2012	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Simultaneous analysis of multiple functional-related phytohormones and their metabolites will improve our understanding of interactions among different hormones in the same biologic process.

RESULTS: A method was developed for simultaneous quantification of multiple phytohormones, abscisic acid, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid, hormone conjugates, IAA-aspartic acid, JA-isoleucine, and methyl JA, and phytoalexins, momilactone A, naringenin, and sakuranetin. This method combines a convenient procedure for preparing filtrated crude extracted samples and a sensitive quantification assay using ultra fast liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-ESI-MS). With this method, we determined the dynamic profiles of defense-related phytohormones, hormone metabolites, and phytoalexins in the interaction of rice with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide.

CONCLUSION: This UFLC-ESI-MS method is convenient, sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive for quantification of multiple phytohormones and metabolites compared to current methods. The results obtained by application of this method in studying rice-bacterial interaction provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of rice defense responses.
20807375	OsEDR1 negatively regulates rice bacterial resistance via activation of ethylene biosynthesis.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of Arabidopsis EDR1. However, its molecular function is unknown. We show here that OsEDR1-suppressing/knockout (KO) plants, which developed spontaneous lesions on the leaves, have enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causing bacterial blight disease. This resistance was associated with increased accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), induced expression of SA- and JA-related genes and suppressed accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the direct precursor of ethylene, and expression of ethylene-related genes. OsEDR1-KO plants also showed suppressed production of ethylene. Knockout of OsEDR1 suppressed the ACC synthase (ACS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC. The lesion phenotype and enhanced bacterial resistance of the OsEDR1-KO plants was partly complemented by the treatment with ACC. ACC treatment was associated with decreased SA and JA biosynthesis in OsEDR1-KO plants. In contrast, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, promoted expression of SA and JA synthesis-related genes in OsEDR1-KO plants. These results suggest that ethylene is a negative signalling molecule in rice bacterial resistance. In the rice-Xoo interaction, OsEDR1 transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that, in turn, suppresses SA- and JA-associated defence signalling.
16008091	Characterization of a rice class II metallothionein gene: tissue expression patterns and induction in response to abiotic factors.	2005	J Plant Physiol	Data mining the complete rice genome sequences revealed a genomic fragment encoding a characteristic metallothionein (MT) protein, and its full-length cDNA was isolated from rice developing seeds by RT-PCR. This cDNA, designated OsMT-II-1a, contains an open reading frame of 264 bp encoding a protein of 87 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence was shown to have structural features characteristic of plant class II MT proteins. By sequence analysis of its 5'-flanking region, one putative TATA box, four putative CAAT boxes, and several short sequences homologous to previously reported regulatory cis-elements were identified. Northern blot analysis showed that accumulation of OsMT-II-1a mRNA is specifically abundant in developing seeds and 2-day glumes after pollination, and OsMT-II-1a transcription can markedly be induced by H2O2, paraquat, SNP, ethephon, ABA and SA, but barely by metal ions or other exogenous abiotic factors such as low temperature and PEG. These results coincide with the prediction of existing regulatory cis-elements in its 5'-flanking region. Taken together, the above results suggest that the processes of pollination and seed development might be mediated, at least in part, by expression of the OsMT-II-1a gene that is regulated by several abiotic factors.
24728832	Natural variation underlies alterations in Nramp aluminum transporter (NRAT1) expression and function that play a key role in rice aluminum tolerance.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for crop production on acid soils which compose ∼ 40% of arable land in the tropics and subtropics. Rice is the most Al-tolerant cereal crop and offers a good model for identifying Al tolerance genes and mechanisms. Here we investigated natural variation in the rice Nramp aluminum transporter (NRAT1) gene encoding a root plasma membrane Al uptake transporter previously hypothesized to underlie a unique Al tolerance mechanism. DNA sequence variation in the NRAT1 coding and regulatory regions was associated with changes in NRAT1 expression and NRAT1 Al transport properties. These sequence changes resulted in significant differences in Al tolerance that were found to be associated with changes in the Al content of root cell wall and cell sap in 24 representative rice lines from a rice association panel. Expression of the tolerant OsNRAT1 allele in yeast resulted in higher Al uptake than did the sensitive allele and conferred greater Al tolerance when expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. These findings indicate that NRAT1 plays an important role in rice Al tolerance by reducing the level of toxic Al in the root cell wall and transporting Al into the root cell, where it is ultimately sequestered in the vacuole. Given its ability to enhance Al tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis, this work suggests that the NRAT1 gene or its orthologs may be useful tools for enhancing Al tolerance in a wide range of plant species.
24755456	The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.	2014	Plant Cell	In male reproductive development in plants, meristemoid precursor cells possessing transient, stem cell-like features undergo cell divisions and differentiation to produce the anther, the male reproductive organ. The anther contains centrally positioned microsporocytes surrounded by four distinct layers of wall: the epidermis, endothecium, middle layer, and tapetum. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2) functions as a crucial switch in the meristemoid transition and differentiation during early anther development. The tip2 mutants display undifferentiated inner three anther wall layers and abort tapetal programmed cell death, causing complete male sterility. TIP2 has two paralogs in rice, TDR and EAT1, which are key regulators of tapetal programmed cell death. We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1. In addition, TIP2 can interact with TDR, indicating a role of TIP2 in later anther development. Our findings suggest that the bHLH proteins TIP2, TDR, and EAT1 play a central role in regulating differentiation, morphogenesis, and degradation of anther somatic cell layers, highlighting the role of paralogous bHLH proteins in regulating distinct steps of plant cell-type determination.
24760826	Natural insertions in rice commonly form tandem duplications indicative of patch-mediated double-strand break induction and repair.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The insertion of DNA into a genome can result in the duplication and dispersal of functional sequences through the genome. In addition, a deeper understanding of insertion mechanisms will inform methods of genetic engineering and plant transformation. Exploiting structural variations in numerous rice accessions, we have inferred and analyzed intermediate length (10-1,000 bp) insertions in plants. Insertions in this size class were found to be approximately equal in frequency to deletions, and compound insertion-deletions comprised only 0.1% of all events. Our findings indicate that, as observed in humans, tandem or partially tandem duplications are the dominant form of insertion (48%), although short duplications from ectopic donors account for a sizable fraction of insertions in rice (38%). Many nontandem duplications contain insertions from nearby DNA (within 200 bp) and can contain multiple donor sources--some distant--in single events. Although replication slippage is a plausible explanation for tandem duplications, the end homology required in such a model is most often absent and rarely is >5 bp. However, end homology is commonly longer than expected by chance. Such findings lead us to favor a model of patch-mediated double-strand-break creation followed by nonhomologous end-joining. Additionally, a striking bias toward 31-bp partially tandem duplications suggests that errors in nucleotide excision repair may be resolved via a similar, but distinct, pathway. In summary, the analysis of recent insertions in rice suggests multiple underappreciated causes of structural variation in eukaryotes.
24728647	Efficient Genome-Wide Detection and Cataloging of EMS-Induced Mutations Using Exome Capture and Next-Generation Sequencing.	2014	Plant Cell	Chemical mutagenesis efficiently generates phenotypic variation in otherwise homogeneous genetic backgrounds, enabling functional analysis of genes. Advances in mutation detection have brought the utility of induced mutant populations on par with those produced by insertional mutagenesis, but systematic cataloguing of mutations would further increase their utility. We examined the suitability of multiplexed global exome capture and sequencing coupled with custom-developed bioinformatics tools to identify mutations in well-characterized mutant populations of rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). In rice, we identified ∼18,000 induced mutations from 72 independent M2 individuals. Functional evaluation indicated the recovery of potentially deleterious mutations for >2600 genes. We further observed that specific sequence and cytosine methylation patterns surrounding the targeted guanine residues strongly affect their probability to be alkylated by ethyl methanesulfonate. Application of these methods to six independent M2 lines of tetraploid wheat demonstrated that our bioinformatics pipeline is applicable to polyploids. In conclusion, we provide a method for developing large-scale induced mutation resources with relatively small investments that is applicable to resource-poor organisms. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that large libraries of sequenced mutations can be readily generated, providing enhanced opportunities to study gene function and assess the effect of sequence and chromatin context on mutations.
24753573	Archaeological and genetic insights into the origins of domesticated rice.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important cereal grains in the world today and serves as a staple food source for more than half of the world's population. Research into when, where, and how rice was brought into cultivation and eventually domesticated, along with its development into a staple food source, is thus essential. These questions have been a point of nearly continuous research in both archaeology and genetics, and new information has continually come to light as theory, data acquisition, and analytical techniques have advanced over time. Here, we review the broad history of our scientific understanding of the rice domestication process from both an archaeological and genetic perspective and examine in detail the information that has come to light in both of these fields in the last 10 y. Current findings from genetics and archaeology are consistent with the domestication of O. sativa japonica in the Yangtze River valley of southern China. Interestingly, although it appears rice was cultivated in the area by as early 8000 BP, the key domestication trait of nonshattering was not fixed for another 1,000 y or perhaps longer. Rice was also cultivated in India as early as 5000 BP, but the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica. These findings are reshaping our understanding of rice domestication and also have implications for understanding the complex evolutionary process of plant domestication.
24781115	A H+-ATPase That Energizes Nutrient Uptake during Mycorrhizal Symbioses in Rice and Medicago truncatula.	2014	Plant Cell	Most plant species form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which facilitate the uptake of mineral nutrients such as phosphate from the soil. Several transporters, particularly proton-coupled phosphate transporters, have been identified on both the plant and fungal membranes and contribute to delivering phosphate from fungi to plants. The mechanism of nutrient exchange has been studied in plants during mycorrhizal colonization, but the source of the electrochemical proton gradient that drives nutrient exchange is not known. Here, we show that plasma membrane H+-ATPases that are specifically induced in arbuscule-containing cells are required for enhanced proton pumping activity in membrane vesicles from AM-colonized roots of rice (Oryza sativa) and Medicago truncatula. Mutation of the H+-ATPases reduced arbuscule size and impaired nutrient uptake by the host plant through the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Overexpression of the H+-ATPase Os-HA1 increased both phosphate uptake and the plasma membrane potential, suggesting that this H+-ATPase plays a key role in energizing the periarbuscular membrane, thereby facilitating nutrient exchange in arbusculated plant cells.
24692424	SPX4 Negatively Regulates Phosphate Signaling and Homeostasis through Its Interaction with PHR2 in Rice.	2014	Plant Cell	PHR2, a central regulator of phosphate signaling in rice, enhanced the expression of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes and resulted in the enhancement of Pi acquisition under Pi deficiency stress. This occurred via PHR2 binding to a cis-element named the PHR1 binding sequences. However, the transcription level of PHR2 was not responsive to Pi starvation. So how is activity of transcription factor PHR2 adjusted to adapt diverse Pi status? Here, we identify an SPX family protein, Os-SPX4 (SPX4 hereafter), involving in Pi starvation signaling and acting as a negative regulator of PHR2. SPX4 is shown to be a fast turnover protein. When Pi is sufficient, through its interaction with PHR2, SPX4 inhibits the binding of PHR2 to its cis-element and reduces the targeting of PHR2 to the nucleus. However, when plants grow under Pi deficiency, the degradation of SPX4 is accelerated through the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby releasing PHR2 into the nucleus and activating the expression of PSI genes. Because the level of SPX4 is responsive to Pi concentration and SPX4 interacts with PHR2 and regulates its activity, this suggests that SPX4 senses the internal Pi concentration under diverse Pi conditions and regulates appropriate responses to maintain Pi homeostasis in plants.
24777451	Heterotrimeric G proteins regulate nitrogen-use efficiency in rice.	2014	Nat Genet	The drive toward more sustainable agriculture has raised the profile of crop plant nutrient-use efficiency. Here we show that a major rice nitrogen-use efficiency quantitative trait locus (qNGR9) is synonymous with the previously identified gene DEP1 (DENSE AND ERECT PANICLES 1). The different DEP1 alleles confer different nitrogen responses, and genetic diversity analysis suggests that DEP1 has been subjected to artificial selection during Oryza sativa spp. japonica rice domestication. The plants carrying the dominant dep1-1 allele exhibit nitrogen-insensitive vegetative growth coupled with increased nitrogen uptake and assimilation, resulting in improved harvest index and grain yield at moderate levels of nitrogen fertilization. The DEP1 protein interacts in vivo with both the Gα (RGA1) and Gβ (RGB1) subunits, and reduced RGA1 or enhanced RGB1 activity inhibits nitrogen responses. We conclude that the plant G protein complex regulates nitrogen signaling and modulation of heterotrimeric G protein activity provides a strategy for environmentally sustainable increases in rice grain yield.
24856112	Blue light-promoted rice leaf bending and unrolling are due to up-regulated brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes accompanied by accumulation of castasterone.	2014	Phytochemistry	In this study the relationship between blue light- and brassinosteroid-enhanced leaf lamina bending and unrolling in rice was investigated. Twenty-four hours (h) irradiation with white or blue light increased endogenous brassinosteroid levels, especially those of typhasterol and castasterone, in aerial tissues of rice seedlings. There was an accompanying up-regulation of transcript levels of CYP85A1/OsDWARF, encoding an enzyme catalyzing C-6 oxidation, after 6h under either white or blue light. These effects were not observed in seedlings placed under far-red or red light regimes. It was concluded that blue light up-regulates the levels of several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP85A1, thereby promoting the synthesis of castasterone, a biologically active brassinosteroid in rice. Based on these findings, it is considered that blue light-mediated rice leaf bending and unrolling are consequences of the enhanced biosynthesis of endogenous castasterone. In contrast to aerial tissues, brassinosteroid synthesis in roots appeared to be negatively regulated by white, blue and red light but positively controlled by far-red light.
24875416	Transcriptome analysis of grain-filling caryopses reveals the potential formation mechanism of the rice sugary mutant.	2014	Gene	A sugary mutant with low total starch and high sugar contents was compared with its wild type Sindongjin for grain-filling caryopses. In the present study, developing seeds of Sindongjin and sugary mutant from the 11th day after flowering (DAF) were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A total of 30,385 and 32,243 genes were identified in Sindongjin and sugary mutant. Transcriptomic change analysis showed that 7713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log₂ fold change ≥1, false discovery rate (FDR)≤0.001) were identified based on our RNA-Seq data, with 7239 genes up-regulated and 474 down-regulated in the sugary mutant. A large number of DEGs were found related to metabolic, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction and starch/sugar metabolism. Detailed pathway dissection and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that most genes involved in sucrose to starch synthesis are up-regulated, whereas the expression of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit (OsAGPS2b) catalyzing the first committed step of starch biosynthesis was specifically inhibited during the grain-filling stage in sugary mutant. Further analysis suggested that the OsAGPS2b is a considerable candidate gene responsible for phenotype of sugary mutant.
24961368	Phytochrome C plays a major role in the acceleration of wheat flowering under long-day photoperiod.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytochromes are dimeric proteins that function as red and far-red light sensors influencing nearly every phase of the plant life cycle. Of the three major phytochrome families found in flowering plants, phytochrome C (PHYC) is the least understood. In Arabidopsis and rice, PHYC is unstable and functionally inactive unless it heterodimerizes with another phytochrome. However, when expressed in an Arabidopsis phy-null mutant, wheat PHYC forms signaling active homodimers that translocate into the nucleus in red light to mediate photomorphogenic responses. Tetraploid wheat plants homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in all PHYC copies (phyC(AB)) flower on average 108 d later than wild-type plants under long days but only 19 d later under short days, indicating a strong interaction between PHYC and photoperiod. This interaction is further supported by the drastic down-regulation in the phyC(AB) mutant of the central photoperiod gene photoperiod 1 (PPD1) and its downstream target flowering locus T1, which are required for the promotion of flowering under long days. These results implicate light-dependent, PHYC-mediated activation of PPD1 expression in the acceleration of wheat flowering under inductive long days. Plants homozygous for the phyC(AB) mutations also show altered profiles of circadian clock and clock-output genes, which may also contribute to the observed differences in heading time. Our results highlight important differences in the photoperiod pathways of the temperate grasses with those of well-studied model plant species.
24908251	Genome-wide association analyses provide genetic and biochemical insights into natural variation in rice metabolism.	2014	Nat Genet	Plant metabolites are important to world food security in terms of maintaining sustainable yield and providing food with enriched phytonutrients. Here we report comprehensive profiling of 840 metabolites and a further metabolic genome-wide association study based on ∼6.4 million SNPs obtained from 529 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa. We identified hundreds of common variants influencing numerous secondary metabolites with large effects at high resolution. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the natural variation of metabolites and their underlying genetic architectures among different subspecies of rice. Data mining identified 36 candidate genes modulating levels of metabolites that are of potential physiological and nutritional importance. As a proof of concept, we functionally identified or annotated five candidate genes influencing metabolic traits. Our study provides insights into the genetic and biochemical bases of rice metabolome variation and can be used as a powerful complementary tool to classical phenotypic trait mapping for rice improvement.
25243661	Identification and validation of functional markers in a global rice collection by association mapping.	2014	Genome	Recent results indicate that marker-assisted selection is an effective approach to reduce the cost and to improve the efficacy and accuracy of selection in plant breeding. This study was conducted to identify and validate molecular markers linked to important breeding traits by association mapping. The association was evaluated between 81 molecular markers (STS, SSR, Indel, CAPS, and PCR-based SNP) and 15 morphological traits in a global panel of 100 rice (Oryza sativa) accessions. The population structure analysis identified three main subpopulations. Obvious kinship relationships were also detected between the rice accessions. Association analysis was performed based on the mixed linear model by considering population structure and family relatedness. In addition, the false discovery rate method was used to correct the multiple testing. A total of 47 marker-trait associations were identified, including 22 markers for 14 traits. Among all, the polymorphism at the loci DDR-GL was highly associated with grain characters (grain length, grain width, and length/width ratio). In addition, marker RM3148 was responsible for five important traits simultaneously. Results demonstrated that such informative markers can be very useful for rice breeding programs using marker-assisted selection. Moreover, the diverse populations of rice accessions are a valuable resource for association mapping of morphological traits.
24951508	OsNAP connects abscisic acid and leaf senescence by fine-tuning abscisic acid biosynthesis and directly targeting senescence-associated genes in rice.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	It has long been established that premature leaf senescence negatively impacts the yield stability of rice, but the underlying molecular mechanism driving this relationship remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a dominant premature leaf senescence mutant, prematurely senile 1 (ps1-D). PS1 encodes a plant-specific NAC (no apical meristem, Arabidopsis ATAF1/2, and cup-shaped cotyledon2) transcriptional activator, Oryza sativa NAC-like, activated by apetala3/pistillata (OsNAP). Overexpression of OsNAP significantly promoted senescence, whereas knockdown of OsNAP produced a marked delay of senescence, confirming the role of this gene in the development of rice senescence. OsNAP expression was tightly linked with the onset of leaf senescence in an age-dependent manner. Similarly, ChIP-PCR and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAP positively regulates leaf senescence by directly targeting genes related to chlorophyll degradation and nutrient transport and other genes associated with senescence, suggesting that OsNAP is an ideal marker of senescence onset in rice. Further analysis determined that OsNAP is induced specifically by abscisic acid (ABA), whereas its expression is repressed in both aba1 and aba2, two ABA biosynthetic mutants. Moreover, ABA content is reduced significantly in ps1-D mutants, indicating a feedback repression of OsNAP on ABA biosynthesis. Our data suggest that OsNAP serves as an important link between ABA and leaf senescence. Additionally, reduced OsNAP expression leads to delayed leaf senescence and an extended grain-filling period, resulting in a 6.3% and 10.3% increase in the grain yield of two independent representative RNAi lines, respectively. Thus, fine-tuning OsNAP expression should be a useful strategy for improving rice yield in the future.
24907341	The Receptor-Like Kinase SIT1 Mediates Salt Sensitivity by Activating MAPK3/6 and Regulating Ethylene Homeostasis in Rice.	2014	Plant Cell	High salinity causes growth inhibition and shoot bleaching in plants that do not tolerate high salt (glycophytes), including most crops. The molecules affected directly by salt and linking the extracellular stimulus to intracellular responses remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa) Salt Intolerance 1 (SIT1), a lectin receptor-like kinase expressed mainly in root epidermal cells, mediates salt sensitivity. NaCl rapidly activates SIT1, and in the presence of salt, as SIT1 kinase activity increased, plant survival decreased. Rice MPK3 and MPK6 function as the downstream effectors of SIT1. SIT1 phosphorylates MPK3 and 6, and their activation by salt requires SIT1. SIT1 mediates ethylene production and salt-induced ethylene signaling. SIT1 promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to growth inhibition and plant death under salt stress, which occurred in an MPK3/6- and ethylene signaling-dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a SIT1-MPK3/6 cascade that mediates salt sensitivity by affecting ROS and ethylene homeostasis and signaling. These results provide important information for engineering salt-tolerant crops.
24982153	HelitronScanner uncovers a large overlooked cache of Helitron transposons in many plant genomes.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transposons make up the bulk of eukaryotic genomes, but are difficult to annotate because they evolve rapidly. Most of the unannotated portion of sequenced genomes is probably made up of various divergent transposons that have yet to be categorized. Helitrons are unusual rolling circle eukaryotic transposons that often capture gene sequences, making them of considerable evolutionary importance. Unlike other DNA transposons, Helitrons do not end in inverted repeats or create target site duplications, so they are particularly challenging to identify. Here we present HelitronScanner, a two-layered local combinational variable (LCV) tool for generalized Helitron identification that represents a major improvement over previous identification programs based on DNA sequence or structure. HelitronScanner identified 64,654 Helitrons from a wide range of plant genomes in a highly automated way. We tested HelitronScanner's predictive ability in maize, a species with highly heterogeneous Helitron elements. LCV scores for the 5' and 3' termini of the predicted Helitrons provide a primary confidence level and element copy number provides a secondary one. Newly identified Helitrons were validated by PCR assays or by in silico comparative analysis of insertion site polymorphism among multiple accessions. Many new Helitrons were identified in model species, such as maize, rice, and Arabidopsis, and in a variety of organisms where Helitrons had not been reported previously to our knowledge, leading to a major upward reassessment of their abundance in plant genomes. HelitronScanner promises to be a valuable tool in future comparative and evolutionary studies of this major transposon superfamily.
24949534	Understanding pathogenic Burkholderia glumae metabolic and signaling pathways within rice tissues through in vivo transcriptome analyses.	2014	Gene	Burkholderia glumae is a causal agent of rice grain and sheath rot. Similar to other phytopathogens, B. glumae adapts well to the host environment and controls its biology to induce diseases in the host plant; however, its molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. To gain a better understating of the actual physiological changes that occur in B. glumae during infection, we analyzed B. glumae transcriptome from infected rice tissues using an RNA-seq technique. To accomplish this, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified 2653 transcripts that were significantly altered. We then performed KEGG pathway and module enrichment of the DEGs. Interestingly, most genes involved bacterial chemotaxis-mediated motility, ascorbate and trehalose metabolisms, and sugar transporters including l-arabinose and d-xylose were found to be highly enriched. The in vivo transcriptional profiling of pathogenic B. glumae will facilitate elucidation of unknown plant-pathogenic bacteria interactions, as well as the overall infection processes.
24982146	Arabidopsis noncoding RNA mediates control of photomorphogenesis by red light.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Seedling photomorphogenesis is a sophisticated developmental process that is controlled by both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Here, we identify an Arabidopsis noncoding RNA, designated hidden treasure 1 (HID1), as a factor promoting photomorphogenesis in continuous red light (cR). We show that HID1 acts through phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor known to be a key repressor of photomorphogenesis. Knockdown of HID1 in hid1 mutants leads to a significant increase in the expression of PIF3, which in turn drives the development of elongated hypocotyls in cR. We identified two major stem-loops in HID1 that are essential for its modulation of hypocotyl growth in cR-grown seedlings. Furthermore, our data reveal that HID1 is assembled into large nuclear protein-RNA complex(es) and that it associates with the chromatin of the first intron of PIF3 to repress its transcription. Strikingly, phylogenetic analysis reveals that many land plants have conserved homologs of HID1 and that its rice homolog can rescue the mutant phenotype when expressed in Arabidopsis hid1 mutants. We thus concluded that HID1 is a previously uncharacterized noncoding RNA whose function represents another layer of regulation in the precise control of seedling photomorphogenesis.
24911626	De novo sequencing and transcriptome analysis of Ustilaginoidea virens by using Illumina paired-end sequencing and development of simple sequence repeat markers.	2014	Gene	Ustilaginoidea virens is the causal agent of rice false smut, which is a rice disease of increasing importance worldwide that has caused with the quantitative and qualitative rice losses. However, research on the pathogenic mechanism of U. virens is limited. In this study, we reported a de novo assembling, annotation, and characterization of the transcriptome and developed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of U. virens. U. virens transcripts of the mycelia and conidia mixture were sequenced using Illumina RNA-seq technology. A total of 52,554,142 clean reads were assembled into 36,496 transcripts representing 18,534 unigenes. Assembled unigenes were annotated through sequence comparison with known protein databases, and 48.48% of the unigenes were without hits in any of these databases. Clusters of orthologous groups for eukaryotic complete genome analysis identified the largest set of genes associated with posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses identified the number of genes associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase and calcium-calcineurin pathways. The study also identified several putative pathogenicity determinants and candidate effectors in U. virens by using the pathogen-host interaction database. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of 12,298 SSR markers. This study provides a better understanding of the biology of U. virens and is an excellent resource for candidate genes required for pathogenesis discovery.
24950892	Regulation of inflorescence branch development in rice through a novel pathway involving the pentatricopeptide repeat protein sped1-D.	2014	Genetics	Panicle type has a direct bearing on rice yield. Here, we characterized a rice clustered-spikelet mutant, sped1-D, with shortened pedicels and/or secondary branches, which exhibits decreased pollen fertility. We cloned sped1-D and found that it encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We investigated the global expression profiles of wild-type, 9311, and sped1-D plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The expression of several GID1L2 family members was downregulated in the sped1-D mutant, suggesting that the gibberellin (GA) pathway is involved in the elongation of pedicels and/or secondary branches. When we overexpressed one GID1L2, AK070299, in sped1-D plants, the panicle phenotype was restored to varying degrees. In addition, we analyzed the expression of genes that function in floral meristems and found that RFL and WOX3 were severely downregulated in sped1-D. These results suggest that sped1-D may prompt the shortening of pedicels and secondary branches by blocking the action of GID1L2, RFL, and Wox3. Moreover, overexpression of sped1-D in Arabidopsis resulted in the shortening of pedicels and clusters of siliques, which indicates that the function of sped1-D is highly conserved in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Sequence data from this article have been deposited with the miRBase Data Libraries under accession no. MI0003201.
24982173	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in plant growth and development. Auxin transport and signaling depend on actin organization. Despite its functional importance, the mechanistic link between actin filaments (F-actin) and auxin intracellular signaling remains unclear. Here, we report that the actin-organizing protein Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (Oryza sativa), provides a key link. Mutants lacking RMD display abnormal cell growth and altered configuration of F-actin array direction. The rmd mutants also exhibit an inhibition of auxin-mediated cell elongation, decreased polar auxin transport, altered auxin distribution gradients in root tips, and suppression of plasma membrane localization of auxin transporters O. sativa PIN-FORMED 1b (OsPIN1b) and OsPIN2 in root cells. We demonstrate that RMD is required for endocytosis, exocytosis, and auxin-mediated OsPIN2 recycling to the plasma membrane. Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD. In support of this regulatory loop, osarf23 and lines with reduced expression of both OsARF23 and OsARF24 display reduced RMD expression, disrupted F-actin organization and cell growth, less sensitivity to auxin response, and altered auxin distribution and OsPIN localization. Our findings establish RMD as a crucial component of the auxin-actin self-organizing regulatory loop from the nucleus to cytoplasm that controls rice cell growth and morphogenesis.
24894043	The bHLH142 Transcription Factor Coordinates with TDR1 to Modulate the Expression of EAT1 and Regulate Pollen Development in Rice.	2014	Plant Cell	Male sterility plays an important role in F1 hybrid seed production. We identified a male-sterile rice (Oryza sativa) mutant with impaired pollen development and a single T-DNA insertion in the transcription factor gene bHLH142. Knockout mutants of bHLH142 exhibited retarded meiosis and defects in tapetal programmed cell death. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses showed that bHLH142 is specifically expressed in the anther, in the tapetum, and in meiocytes during early meiosis. Three basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, UDT1 (bHLH164), TDR1 (bHLH5), and EAT1/DTD1 (bHLH141) are known to function in rice pollen development. bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB but upstream of TDR1 and EAT1 in pollen development. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that bHLH142 and TDR1 proteins interact. Transient promoter assays demonstrated that regulation of the EAT1 promoter requires bHLH142 and TDR1. Consistent with these results, 3D protein structure modeling predicted that bHLH142 and TDR1 form a heterodimer to bind to the EAT1 promoter. EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death. Thus, in this study, we identified bHLH142 as having a pivotal role in tapetal programmed cell death and pollen development.
24906292	The biosynthesis, composition and assembly of the outer pollen wall: A tough case to crack.	2015	Phytochemistry	The formation of the durable outer pollen wall, largely composed of sporopollenin, is essential for the protection of the male gametophyte and plant reproduction. Despite its apparent strict conservation amongst land plants, the composition of sporopollenin and the biosynthetic pathway(s) yielding this recalcitrant biopolymer remain elusive. Recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and rice have, however, identified key genes involved in sporopollenin formation, allowing a better understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology underlying sporopollenin biosynthesis and pollen wall development. Herein, current knowledge of the biochemical composition of the outer pollen wall is reviewed, with an emphasis on enzymes with characterized biochemical activities in sporopollenin and pollen coat biosynthesis. The tapetum, which forms the innermost sporophytic cell layer of the anther and envelops developing pollen, plays an essential role in sporopollenin and pollen coat formation. Recent studies show that several tapetum-expressed genes encode enzymes that metabolize fatty acid derived compounds to form putative sporopollenin precursors, including tetraketides derived from fatty acyl-CoA starter molecules, but analysis of mutants defective in pollen wall development indicate that other components are also incorporated into sporopollenin. Also highlighted are the many uncertainties remaining in the development of a sporopollenin-fortified pollen wall, particularly in relation to the mechanisms of sporopollenin precursor transport and assembly into the patterned form of the pollen wall. A working model for sporopollenin biosynthesis is proposed based on the data obtained largely from studies of Arabidopsis, and future challenges to complete our understanding of pollen wall biology are outlined.
24905652	Nucleotide diversity of Pita, a major blast resistance gene and identification of its minimal promoter.	2014	Gene	Improvement of host plant resistance is one of the best methods to protect the yield from biotic stresses. Incorporation of major resistance genes or their variants into elite rice varieties will enhance the host plant resistance and its durability. Allele mining is a preferred choice to discover the novel allelic variants of major genes from wide range of germplasm. 'True' allele mining includes coding and noncoding regions, which are known to affect the plant phenotype, eventually. In this study, major blast resistance gene, Pita was analyzed by allele and promoter mining strategy and its different allelic variants were discovered from landraces and wild Oryza species. Polymorphisms at allelic sequences as well as transcription factor binding motif (TFBM) level were examined. At motif level, MYB1AT is present in Pita(Tadukan) and other resistance alleles, but was absent in the susceptible allele. Core promoter was demarked with 449 bp, employing serial promoter deletion strategy. Promoter with 1592 bp upstream region could express the gfp two fold higher than the core promoter. The identified Pita resistance allele (Pita(Konibora)) can be directly used in rice blast resistance breeding programs. Moreover, characterization of Pita core promoter led to deeper understanding of resistance gene's regulation and the identified core promoter can be utilized to express similar genes in rice.
24887487	Expression patterns of QTL based and other candidate genes in Madhukar × Swarna RILs with contrasting levels of iron and zinc in unpolished rice grains.	2014	Gene	BACKGROUND: Identifying QTLs/genes for iron and zinc in rice grains can help in biofortification programs. Genome wide mapping showed 14 QTLs for iron and zinc concentration in unpolished rice grains of F7 RILs derived from Madhukar × Swarna. One line (HL) with high Fe and Zn and one line (LL) with low Fe and Zn in unpolished rice were compared with each other for gene expression using qPCR. 7 day old seedlings were grown in Fe+ and Fe- medium for 10 days and RNA extracted from roots and shoots to determine the response of 15 genes in Fe- conditions.

RESULTS: HL showed higher upregulation than LL in shoots but LL showed higher upregulation than HL in roots. YSL2 was upregulated only in HL roots and YSL15 only in HL shoots and both up to 60 fold under Fe- condition. IRT2 and DMAS1 were upregulated 100 fold and NAS2 1000 fold in HL shoot. NAS2, IRT1, IRT2 and DMAS1 were upregulated 40 to 100 fold in LL roots. OsZIP8, OsNAS3, OsYSL1 and OsNRAMP1 which underlie major Fe QTL showed clear allelic differences between HL and LL for markers flanking QTL. The presence of iron increasing QTL allele in HL was clearly correlated with high expression of the underlying gene. OsZIP8 and OsNAS3 which were within major QTL with increasing effect from Madhukar were 8 fold and 4 fold more expressed in HL shoot than in LL shoot. OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3, OsYSL2 and OsYSL15 showed 1.5 to 2.5 fold upregulation in flag leaf of HL when compared with flag leaf of Swarna.

CONCLUSION: HL and LL differed in root length, Fe concentration and expression of several genes under Fe deficiency. The major distinguishing genes were NAS2, IRT2, DMAS1, and YSL15 in shoot and NAS2, IRT1, IRT2, YSL2, and ZIP8 in roots. The presence of iron increasing QTL allele in HL at marker locus close to genes also increased upregulation in HL.
25035404	Direct phosphorylation and activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase by a calcium-dependent protein kinase in rice.	2014	Plant Cell	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a pivotal point of convergence for many signaling pathways in eukaryotes. In the classical MAPK cascade, a signal is transmitted via sequential phosphorylation and activation of MAPK kinase kinase, MAPK kinase (MKK), and MAPK. The activation of MAPK is dependent on dual phosphorylation of a TXY motif by an MKK, which is considered the sole kinase to phosphorylate and activate MAPK. Here, we report a novel regulatory mechanism of MAPK phosphorylation and activation besides the canonical MAPK cascade. A rice (Oryza sativa) calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), CPK18, was identified as an upstream kinase of MAPK (MPK5) in vitro and in vivo. Curiously, CPK18 was shown to phosphorylate and activate MPK5 without affecting the phosphorylation of its TXY motif. Instead, CPK18 was found to predominantly phosphorylate two Thr residues (Thr-14 and Thr-32) that are widely conserved in MAPKs from land plants. Further analyses reveal that the newly identified CPK18-MPK5 pathway represses defense gene expression and negatively regulates rice blast resistance. Our results suggest that land plants have evolved an MKK-independent phosphorylation pathway that directly connects calcium signaling to the MAPK machinery.

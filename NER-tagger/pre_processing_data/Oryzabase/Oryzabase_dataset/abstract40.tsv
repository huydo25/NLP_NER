26347131	Divergent biochemical and enzymatic properties of oxalate oxidase isoforms encoded by four similar genes in rice.	2015	Phytochemistry	The biochemical and enzymatic properties of four highly similar rice oxalate oxidase proteins (OsOxO1-4) were compared after their purification from the leaves of transgenic plants each overexpressing the respective OsOxO1-4 genes. Although alignment of their amino acid sequences has revealed divergence mainly in the signal peptides and they catalyze the same enzymic (oxalate oxidase) reaction, divergence in apparent molecular mass, Km, optimum pH, stability and responses to inhibitors and activators was uncovered by biochemical characterization of the purified OsOxO1-4 proteins. The apparent molecular mass of oligomer OsOxO1 was found to be similar to that of OsOxO3 but lower than the other two. The molecular mass of the subunit of OsOxO1 was lower than that of OsOxO3. The Km value of OsOxO3 was higher than the other three which had similar Km. OsOxO1 and OsOxO4 possessed peak activity at pH 8.5 which was close to that at the optimum pH 4.0. The activity of OsOxO2 at pH 8.5 was only 65% of that at its optimum pH 3.5, while the activity of OsOxO3 did not vary much at pH 6-9 and was also much lower than that at its optimum pH 3. OsOxO2 and OsOxO3 still maintained all their activities after being heated at 70°C for 1h while OsOxO1 and OsOxO4 lost about 30% of their activities. Pyruvate and oxaloacetic acid inhibited the activity of OsOxO3 more strongly than the other three. Interestingly, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-biphosphate related to photosynthetic assimilation of triose phosphate greatly increased the activities of OsOxO3 and OsOxO4. In addition to the differences in the biochemical properties of the four OsOxO proteins, an intriguing finding is that the purified OsOxO1-4 exhibited substrate inhibition, which is a typical of the classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics exhibited by a majority of other enzymes.
26358652	Breeding signatures of rice improvement revealed by a genomic variation map from a large germplasm collection.	2015	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Intensive rice breeding over the past 50 y has dramatically increased productivity especially in the indica subspecies, but our knowledge of the genomic changes associated with such improvement has been limited. In this study, we analyzed low-coverage sequencing data of 1,479 rice accessions from 73 countries, including landraces and modern cultivars. We identified two major subpopulations, indica I (IndI) and indica II (IndII), in the indica subspecies, which corresponded to the two putative heterotic groups resulting from independent breeding efforts. We detected 200 regions spanning 7.8% of the rice genome that had been differentially selected between IndI and IndII, and thus referred to as breeding signatures. These regions included large numbers of known functional genes and loci associated with important agronomic traits revealed by genome-wide association studies. Grain yield was positively correlated with the number of breeding signatures in a variety, suggesting that the number of breeding signatures in a line may be useful for predicting agronomic potential and the selected loci may provide targets for rice improvement.
26362607	The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.	2015	Plant Cell	The origin and spread of novel agronomic traits during crop domestication are complex events in plant evolution. Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) has red grains due to the accumulation of proanthocyanidins, whereas most cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) varieties have white grains induced by a defective allele in the Rc basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene. Although the events surrounding the origin and spread of black rice traits remain unknown, varieties with black grains due to anthocyanin accumulation are distributed in various locations throughout Asia. Here, we show that the black grain trait originated from ectopic expression of the Kala4 bHLH gene due to rearrangement in the promoter region. Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments. Genome analysis of 21 black rice varieties as well as red- and white-grained landraces demonstrated that black rice arose in tropical japonica and its subsequent spread to the indica subspecies can be attributed to the causal alleles of Kala4. The relatively small size of genomic fragments of tropical japonica origin in some indica varieties indicates that refined introgression must have occurred by natural crossbreeding in the course of evolution of the black trait in rice.
26423116	C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.	2015	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	A large number of calmodulin-like (CML) proteins are present in plants, but there is little detailed information on the functions of these proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, the CML3 protein from rice (OsCML3) and its truncated form lacking the C-terminal extension (OsCML3m) were found to exhibit a Ca2+-binding property and subsequent conformational change, but the ability to bind the CaM kinase II peptide was only observed for OsCML3m. Changes in their secondary structure upon Ca2+-binding measured by circular dichroism revealed that OsCML3m had a higher helical content than OsCML3. Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus. The rice high mobility group B1 (OsHMGB1) protein was identified as one of the putative OsCML3 target proteins. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that OsHMGB1 bound OsCML3, OsCML3m or OsCML3s (cysteine to serine mutation at the prenylation site) in the nucleus presumably through the methionine and phenylalanine-rich hydrophobic patches, confirming that OsHMGB1 is a target protein in planta. The effect of OsCML3 or OsCML3m on the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 was measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. OsCML3m decreased the level of OsHMGB1 binding to pUC19 double-stranded DNA whereas OsCML3 did not. Taken together, OsCML3 probably provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca2+ regulatory switch.
26381316	The Rice E3-Ubiquitin Ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 Modulates the Expression of ROOT MEANDER CURLING, a Gene Involved in Root Mechanosensing, through the Interaction with Two ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR Transcription Factors.	2015	Plant Physiol	Plant roots can sense and respond to a wide diversity of mechanical stimuli, including touch and gravity. However, little is known about the signal transduction pathways involved in mechanical stimuli responses in rice (Oryza sativa). This work shows that rice root responses to mechanical stimuli involve the E3-ubiquitin ligase rice HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (OsHOS1), which mediates protein degradation through the proteasome complex. The morphological analysis of the roots in transgenic RNA interference::OsHOS1 and wild-type plants, exposed to a mechanical barrier, revealed that the OsHOS1 silencing plants keep a straight root in contrast to wild-type plants that exhibit root curling. Moreover, it was observed that the absence of root curling in response to touch can be reverted by jasmonic acid. The straight root phenotype of the RNA interference::OsHOS1 plants was correlated with a higher expression rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING (OsRMC), which encodes a receptor-like kinase characterized as a negative regulator of rice root curling mediated by jasmonic acid. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we showed that OsHOS1 interacts with two ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors, rice ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN1 (OsEREBP1) and rice OsEREBP2, known to regulate OsRMC gene expression. In addition, we showed that OsHOS1 affects the stability of both transcription factors in a proteasome-dependent way, suggesting that this E3-ubiquitin ligase targets OsEREBP1 and OsEREBP2 for degradation. Our results highlight the function of the proteasome in rice response to mechanical stimuli and in the integration of these signals, through hormonal regulation, into plant growth and developmental programs.
26424158	OsMADS26 Negatively Regulates Resistance to Pathogens and Drought Tolerance in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Functional analyses of MADS-box transcription factors in plants have unraveled their role in major developmental programs (e.g. flowering and floral organ identity) as well as stress-related developmental processes, such as abscission, fruit ripening, and senescence. Overexpression of the rice (Oryza sativa) MADS26 gene in rice has revealed a possible function related to stress response. Here, we show that OsMADS26-down-regulated plants exhibit enhanced resistance against two major rice pathogens: Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae. Despite this enhanced resistance to biotic stresses, OsMADS26-down-regulated plants also displayed enhanced tolerance to water deficit. These phenotypes were observed in both controlled and field conditions. Interestingly, alteration of OsMADS26 expression does not have a strong impact on plant development. Gene expression profiling revealed that a majority of genes misregulated in overexpresser and down-regulated OsMADS26 lines compared with control plants are associated to biotic or abiotic stress response. Altogether, our data indicate that OsMADS26 acts as an upstream regulator of stress-associated genes and thereby, a hub to modulate the response to various stresses in the rice plant.
26358044	Molecular dissection of a rice microtubule-associated RING finger protein and its potential role in salt tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Although a number of RING E3 ligases in plants have been demonstrated to play key roles in a wide range of abiotic stresses, relatively few studies have detailed how RING E3 ligases exert their cellular actions. We describe Oryza sativa RING finger protein with microtubule-targeting domain 1 (OsRMT1), a functional RING E3 ligase that is likely involved in a salt tolerance mechanism. Functional characterization revealed that OsRMT1 undergoes homodimer formation and subsequently autoubiquitination-mediated protein degradation under normal conditions. By contrast, OsRMT1 is predominantly found in the nucleus and microtubules and its degradation is inhibited under salt stress. Domain dissection of OsRMT1 indicates that the N-terminal domain is required for microtubule targeting. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis and degradation assay revealed that OsRMT1-interacted proteins localized in various organelles were degraded via the ubiquitin (Ub)/26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, when OsRMT1 and its target proteins were co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves, the protein-protein interactions appeared to take place mainly in the microtubules. Overexpression of OsRMT1 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased tolerance to salt stress. Our findings suggest that the abundance of microtubule-associated OsRMT1 is strictly regulated, and OsRMT1 may play a relevant role in salt stress response by modulating levels of its target proteins.
26337938	Functions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Relative little is known about the functions of the so-called Dof zinc factors in plants. Here we report on the analysis of OsDof25 and show a function in regulation of the important C4 photosynthesis gene, OsC4PPDK in rice. Over-expression of OsDof25 enhanced the expression of OsC4PPDK in transient expression experiments by binding in a specific way to a conserved Dof binding site which was confirmed by yeast and in vitro binding studies. Expression studies using promoter GUS plants as well as qPCR experiments showed that OsDof25 expressed in different tissues including both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs and that expression of OsDof25 was partially overlapping with the OsC4PPDK gene. Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as transcriptional activator.
26408146	Ectopic expression of Pokkali phosphoglycerate kinase-2 (OsPGK2-P) improves yield in tobacco plants under salinity stress.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Our results indicate that OsPGK2a-P gene is differentially regulated in contrasting rice cultivars under stress and its overexpression confers salt stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK; EC = 2.7.2.3) plays a major role for ATP production during glycolysis and 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate production to participate in the Calvin cycle for carbon fixation in plants. Whole genome analysis of rice reveals the presence of four PGK genes (OsPgks) on different chromosomes. Comparative expression analysis of OsPgks in rice revealed highest level of transcripts for OsPgk2 at most of its developmental stages. Detailed characterization of OsPgk2 transcript and protein showed that it is strongly induced by salinity stress in two contrasting genotypes of rice, i.e., cv IR64 (salt sensitive) and landrace Pokkali (salt tolerant). Ectopic expression of OsPgk2a-P (isolated from Pokkali) in transgenic tobacco improved its salinity stress tolerance by higher chlorophyll retention and enhanced proline accumulation, besides maintaining better ion homeostasis. Ectopically expressing OsPgk2a-P transgenic tobacco plants showed tall phenotype with more number of pods than wild-type plants. Therefore, OsPgk2a-P appears to be a potential candidate for increasing salinity stress tolerance and enhanced yield in crop plants.
26186703	Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii, and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.	2015	Plant J	Vesicle trafficking including the exocytosis pathway is intimately associated with host immunity against pathogens. However, we still have insufficient knowledge about how it contributes to immunity, and how pathogen factors affect it. In this study, we explore host factors that interact with the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pii. Gel filtration chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays identified a 150 kDa complex of proteins in the soluble fraction comprising AVR-Pii and OsExo70-F2 and OsExo70-F3, two rice Exo70 proteins presumably involved in exocytosis. Simultaneous knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and F3 totally abrogated Pii immune receptor-dependent resistance, but had no effect on Pia- and Pik-dependent resistance. Knockdown levels of OsExo70-F3 but not OsExo70-F2 correlated with reduction of Pii function, suggesting that OsExo70-F3 is specifically involved in Pii-dependent resistance. Under our current experimental conditions, over-expression of AVR-Pii or knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and -F3 genes in rice did not affect the virulence of compatible isolates of M. oryzae. AVR-Pii interaction with OsExo70-F3 appears to play a crucial role in immunity triggered by Pii, suggesting a role for OsExo70 as a decoy or helper in Pii/AVR-Pii interactions.
26394329	Global Identification of Genes Specific for Rice Meiosis.	2015	PLoS One	The leptotene-zygotene transition is a major step in meiotic progression during which pairing between homologous chromosomes is initiated and double strand breaks occur. OsAM1, a homologue of maize AM1 and Arabidopsis SWI1, encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain in its central region that is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition during rice meiosis. To gain more insight into the role of OsAM1 in rice meiosis and identify additional meiosis-specific genes, we characterized the transcriptomes of young panicles of Osam1 mutant and wild-type rice plants using RNA-Seq combined with bioinformatic and statistical analyses. As a result, a total of 25,750 and 28,455 genes were expressed in young panicles of wild-type and Osam1 mutant plants, respectively, and 4,400 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2 Ratio ≥ 1, FDR ≤ 0.05) were identified. Of these DEGs, four known rice meiosis-specific genes were detected, and 22 new putative meiosis-related genes were found by mapping these DEGs to reference biological pathways in the KEGG database. We identified eight additional well-conserved OsAM1-responsive rice meiotic genes by comparing our RNA-Seq data with known meiotic genes in Arabidopsis and fission yeast.
26359114	Interaction of HSP20 with a viral RdRp changes its sub-cellular localization and distribution pattern in plants.	2015	Sci Rep	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) perform a fundamental role in protecting cells against a wide array of stresses but their biological function during viral infection remains unknown. Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes a severe disease of rice in Eastern Asia. OsHSP20 and its homologue (NbHSP20) were used as baits in yeast two-hybrid (YTH) assays to screen an RSV cDNA library and were found to interact with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RSV. Interactions were confirmed by pull-down and BiFC assays. Further analysis showed that the N-terminus (residues 1-296) of the RdRp was crucial for the interaction between the HSP20s and viral RdRp and responsible for the alteration of the sub-cellular localization and distribution pattern of HSP20s in protoplasts of rice and epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. This is the first report that a plant virus or a viral protein alters the expression pattern or sub-cellular distribution of sHSPs.
26362328	Characterization and Functional Analysis of Pyrabactin Resistance-Like Abscisic Acid Receptor Family in Rice.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Abscisic acid (ABA) plays crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development, especially in responding to abiotic stress. The pyrabactin resistance-like (PYL) abscisic acid receptor family has been identified and widely characterized in Arabidopsis. However, PYL families in rice were largely unknown. In the present study, 10 out of 13 PYL orthologs in rice (OsPYL) were isolated and investigated.

RESULTS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of OsPYL genes is tissue-specific and display differential response to ABA treatment, implying their functional diversity. The interaction between 10 OsPYL members and 5 protein phosphatase 2C in rice (OsPP2C) members was investigated in yeast two-hybrid and tobacco transient expression assays, and an overall interaction map was generated, which was suggestive of the diversity and complexity of ABA-sensing signaling in rice. To study the biological function of OsPYLs, two OsPYL genes (OsPYL3 and OsPYL9) were overexpressed in rice. Phenotypic analysis of OsPYL3 and OsPYL9 transgenic rice showed that OsPYLs positively regulated the ABA response during the seed germination. More importantly, the overexpression of OsPYL3 and OsPYL9 substantially improved drought and cold stress tolerance in rice.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, we comprehensively uncovered the properties of OsPYLs, which may be good candidates for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
26442000	NAC transcription factor family genes are differentially expressed in rice during infections with Rice dwarf virus, Rice black-streaked dwarf virus, Rice grassy stunt virus, Rice ragged stunt virus, and Rice transitory yellowing virus.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Expression levels of the NAC gene family were studied in rice infected with Rice dwarf virus (RDV), Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV), Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), and Rice transitory yellowing virus (RTYV). Microarray analysis showed that 75 (68%) OsNAC genes were differentially regulated during infection with RDV, RBSDV, RGSV, and RRSV compared with the control. The number of OsNAC genes up-regulated was highest during RGSV infection, while the lowest number was found during RTYV infection. These phenomena correlate with the severity of the syndromes induced by the virus infections. Most of the genes in the NAC subgroups NAC22, SND, ONAC2, ANAC34, and ONAC3 were down-regulated for all virus infections. These OsNAC genes might be related to the health stage maintenance of the host plants. Interestingly, most of the genes in the subgroups TIP and SNAC were more highly expressed during RBSDV and RGSV infections. These results suggested that OsNAC genes might be related to the responses induced by the virus infection. All of the genes assigned to the TIP subgroups were highly expressed during RGSV infection when compared with the control. For RDV infection, the number of activated genes was greatest during infection with the S-strain, followed by the D84-strain and the O-strain, with seven OsNAC genes up-regulated during infection by all three strains. The Os12g03050 and Os11g05614 genes showed higher expression during infection with four of the five viruses, and Os11g03310, Os11g03370, and Os07g37920 genes showed high expression during at least three viral infections. We identified some duplicate genes that are classified as neofunctional and subfunctional according to their expression levels in different viral infections. A number of putative cis-elements were identified, which may help to clarify the function of these key genes in network pathways.
26400148	The plasma membrane NADPH oxidase OsRbohA plays a crucial role in developmental regulation and drought-stress response in rice.	2016	Physiol Plant	Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases are major producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells under normal growth and stress conditions. In the present study the total activity of rice NADPH oxidases and the transcription of OsRbohA, which encodes an Oryza sativa plasma membrane NADPH oxidase, were stimulated by drought. OsRbohA was expressed in all tissues examined throughout development. Its mRNA was upregulated by a number of factors, including heat, drought, salt, oxidative stress and methyl jasmonate treatment. Compared with wild-type (WT), the OsRbohA-knockout mutant osrbohA exhibited upregulated expression of other respiratory burst oxidase homolog genes and multiple abnormal agronomic traits, including reduced biomass, low germination rate and decreased pollen viability and seed fertility. However, OsRbohA-overexpressing transgenic plants showed no differences in these traits compared with WT. Although osrbohA leaves and roots produced more ROS than WT, the mutant had lesser intracellular ROS. In contrast, OsRbohA-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited higher ROS production at the intracellular level and in tissues. Ablation of OsRbohA impaired the tolerance of plants to various water stresses, whereas its overexpression enhanced the tolerance. In addition, a number of genes related to energy supply, substrate transport, stress response and transcriptional regulation were differentially expressed in osrbohA plants even under normal growth conditions, suggesting that OsRbohA has fundamental and broad functions in rice. These results indicate that OsRbohA-mediated processes are governed by complex signaling pathways that function during the developmental regulation and drought-stress response in rice.
26414948	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of WNK kinase gene family in rice.	2015	Comput Biol Chem	Eukaryotic protein kinases represent one of the largest gene families involved in diverse regulatory functions. WNK (With No Lysine) kinases are members of ser/thr protein kinase family, which lack conserved catalytic lysine (K) residue at protein kinase subdomain II and is replaced by either asparagine, serine or glycine residues. They are involved in regulation of flowering time, circadian rhythms and abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, we have identified 9 members of WNK in rice, showed resemblance to Arabidopsis and human WNK and clustered into five main clades phylogenetically. The predicted genes structure, bonafide conserved signature motif and domains strongly support their identity, as members of WNK kinase family. We have analyzed their chromosomal distribution, physio-chemical properties, subcellular localizations and cis-elements in the promoter regions in silico. Further, transcript analysis of OsWNK by qRT-PCR revealed their differential regulation in tissue specific and abiotic stresses libraries. In conclusion, the identification of nine OsWNK and transcript level expression pattern under abiotic stress using qRT-PCR in rice will significantly contribute towards the understanding of WNK genes in monocots and thus provide a set up for functional genomics studies of WNK protein kinases.
26401987	Expression of Rice CYP450-Like Gene (Os08g01480) in Arabidopsis Modulates Regulatory Network Leading to Heavy Metal and Other Abiotic Stress Tolerance.	2015	PLoS One	Heavy metal (HM) toxicity has become a grave problem in the world since it leads to hazardous effects on living organisms. Transcriptomic/proteomic studies in plants have identified a large number of metal-responsive gene families. Of these, cytochrome-P450 (CYPs) family members are composed of enzymes carrying out detoxification of exogenous molecules. Here, we report a CYP-like protein encoded by Os08g01480 locus in rice that helps the plant to combat HM and other abiotic stresses. To functionally characterize CYP-like gene, cDNA and promoter were isolated from rice to develop Arabidopsis transgenic lines. Heterologous expression of Os08g01480 in Arabidopsis provided significant tolerance towards abiotic stresses. In silico analysis reveals that Os08g01480 might help plants to combat environmental stress via modulating auxin metabolism. Transgenic lines expressing reporter gene under control of Os08g01480 promoter demonstrated differential promoter activity in different tissues during environmental stresses. These studies indicated that differential expression of Os08g01480 might be modulating response of plants towards environmental stresses as well as in different developmental stages.
26350069	Green tissue-specific co-expression of chitinase and oxalate oxidase 4 genes in rice for enhanced resistance against sheath blight.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Green tissue-specific simultaneous overexpression of two defense-related genes ( OsCHI11 & OsOXO4 ) in rice leads to significant resistance against sheath blight pathogen ( R. solani ) without distressing any agronomically important traits. Overexpressing two defense-related genes (OsOXO4 and OsCHI11) cloned from rice is effective at enhancing resistance against sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani. These genes were expressed under the control of two different green tissue-specific promoters, viz. maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene promoter, PEPC, and rice cis-acting 544-bp DNA element, immediately upstream of the D54O translational start site, P D54O-544 . Putative T0 transgenic rice plants were screened by PCR and integration of genes was confirmed by Southern hybridization of progeny (T1) rice plants. Successful expression of OsOXO4 and OsCHI11 in all tested plants was confirmed. Expression of PR genes increased significantly following pathogen infection in overexpressing transgenic plants. Following infection, transgenic plants exhibited elevated hydrogen peroxide levels, significant changes in activity of ROS scavenging enzymes and reduced membrane damage when compared to their wild-type counterpart. In a Rhizoctonia solani toxin assay, a detached leaf inoculation test and an in vivo plant bioassay, transgenic plants showed a significant reduction in disease symptoms in comparison to non-transgenic control plants. This is the first report of overexpression of two different PR genes driven by two green tissue-specific promoters providing enhanced sheath blight resistance in transgenic rice.
26350403	CEF1/OsMYB103L is involved in GA-mediated regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Although the main genes in rice involved in the biosynthesis of secondary wall components have been characterized, the molecular mechanism underlying coordinated regulation of genes expression is not clear. In this study, we reported a new rice variety, cef1, showed the culm easily fragile (CEF) without other concomitant phenotypes. The CEF1 gene encodes a MYB family transcription factor OsMYB103L, was cloned based on map-based approach. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that CEF1 belongs to the R2R3-MYB subfamily and highly similar to Arabidopsis AtMYB103. Expression pattern analysis indicated that CEF1 is mainly expressed in internodes and panicles. Biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMYB103L is a nuclear protein and shows high transcriptional activation activity at C-terminus. OsMYB103L mediates cellulose biosynthesis and secondary walls formation mainly through directly binding the CESA4, CESA7, CESA9 and BC1 promoters and regulating their expression. OsMYB103L may also function as a master switch to regulate the expression of several downstream TFs, which involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis. Furthermore, OsMYB103L physically interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and involved in GA-mediated regulation of cellulose synthesis pathway. Our findings revealed that OsMYB103L plays an important role in GA-regulating secondary cell wall synthesis, and the manipulation of this gene provide a new strategy to help the straw decay in soil.
26442027	Differentially expressed seed aging responsive heat shock protein OsHSP18.2 implicates in seed vigor, longevity and improves germination and seedling establishment under abiotic stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a diverse group of proteins and are highly abundant in plant species. Although majority of these sHSPs were shown to express specifically in seed, their potential function in seed physiology remains to be fully explored. Our proteomic analysis revealed that OsHSP18.2, a class II cytosolic HSP is an aging responsive protein as its abundance significantly increased after artificial aging in rice seeds. OsHSP18.2 transcript was found to markedly increase at the late maturation stage being highly abundant in dry seeds and sharply decreased after germination. Our biochemical study clearly demonstrated that OsHSP18.2 forms homooligomeric complex and is dodecameric in nature and functions as a molecular chaperone. OsHSP18.2 displayed chaperone activity as it was effective in preventing thermal inactivation of Citrate Synthase. Further, to analyze the function of this protein in seed physiology, seed specific Arabidopsis overexpression lines for OsHSP18.2 were generated. Our subsequent functional analysis clearly demonstrated that OsHSP18.2 has ability to improve seed vigor and longevity by reducing deleterious ROS accumulation in seeds. In addition, transformed Arabidopsis seeds also displayed better performance in germination and cotyledon emergence under adverse conditions. Collectively, our work demonstrates that OsHSP18.2 is an aging responsive protein which functions as a molecular chaperone and possibly protect and stabilize the cellular proteins from irreversible damage particularly during maturation drying, desiccation and aging in seeds by restricting ROS accumulation and thereby improves seed vigor, longevity and seedling establishment.
26687131	High CO2 concentration as an inductor agent to drive production of recombinant phytotoxic antimicrobial peptides in plant biofactories.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides such as BP100 are of increasing interest for developing novel phytosanitary or therapeutic agents and products with industrial applications. Biotechnological production of these peptides in plants can be severely impaired due to the toxicity exerted on the host by high-level expression. This can be overcome by using inducible promoters with extremely low activity throughout plant development, although the yields are limited. We examined the use of modified atmospheres using the increased levels of [CO2], commonly used in the food industry, as the inductor agent to biotechnologically produce phytotoxic compounds with higher yields. Here we show that 30% [CO2] triggered a profound transcriptional response in rice leaves, including a change in the energy provision from photosynthesis to glycolysis, and the activation of stress defense mechanisms. Five genes with central roles in up-regulated pathways were initially selected and their promoters successfully used to drive the expression of phytotoxic BP100 in genetically modified (GM) rice. GM plants had a normal phenotype on development and seed production in non-induction conditions. Treatment with 30 % [CO2] led to recombinant peptide accumulation of up to 1 % total soluble protein when the Os.hb2 promoter was used. This is within the range of biotechnological production of other peptides in plants. Using BP100 as a proof-of-concept we demonstrate that very high [CO2] can be considered an economically viable strategy to drive production of recombinant phytotoxic antimicrobial peptides in plant biofactories.
26689934	Deep sequencing transcriptional fingerprinting of rice kernels for dissecting grain quality traits.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice represents one the most important foods all over the world. In Europe, Italy is the first rice producer and Italian production is driven by tradition and quality. All main rice grain quality traits, like cooking properties, texture, gelatinization temperature, chalkiness and yield, are related to the content and composition of starch and seed-storage proteins in the endosperm and to grain shape. In addition, a number of nutraceutical compounds and allergens are known to have a significant effect on grain quality determination. To investigate the genetic bases underlying the qualitative differences that characterize traditional Italian rice cultivars, a comparative RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis of developing caryopsis was conducted at 14 days after flowering on six popular Italian varieties (Carnaroli, Arborio, Balilla, Vialone Nano, Gigante Vercelli and Volano) phenotypically differing for qualitative grain-related traits.

RESULTS: Co-regulation analyses of differentially expressed genes showing the same expression patterns in the six genotypes highlighted clusters of loci up or down-regulated in specific varieties, with respect to the others. Among them, we detected loci involved in cell wall biosynthesis, protein metabolism and redox homeostasis, classes of genes affecting in chalkiness determination. Moreover, loci encoding for seed-storage proteins, allergens or involved in the biosynthesis of specific nutraceutical compounds were also present and specifically regulated in the different clusters. A wider investigation of all the DEGs detected in pair-wise comparisons revealed transcriptional variation, among the six genotypes, for quality-related loci involved in starch biosynthesis (e.g. GBSSI, starch synthases and AGPase), genes encoding for transcription factors, additional seed storage proteins, allergens or belonging to additional nutraceutical compounds biosynthetic pathways and loci affecting grain size. Putative functional SNPs associated to amylose content in starch, gelatinization temperature and grain size were also identified.

CONCLUSIONS: The present work represents a more extended phenotypic characterization of a set of rice accessions that present a wider genetic variability than described nowadays in literature. The results provide the first transcriptional picture for several of the grain quality differences observed among the Italian rice varieties analyzed and reveal that each variety is characterized by the over-expression of a peculiar set of loci affecting grain appearance and quality. A list of candidates and SNPs affecting specific grain properties has been identified offering a starting point for further works aimed to characterize genes and molecular markers for breeding programs.
26713549	Microarray-based gene expression analysis of strong seed dormancy in rice cv. N22 and less dormant mutant derivatives.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Seed dormancy in rice is an important trait related to the pre-harvest sprouting resistance. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of seed dormancy, gene expression was investigated by transcriptome analysis using seeds of the strongly dormant cultivar N22 and its less dormant mutants Q4359 and Q4646 at 24 days after heading (DAH). Microarray data revealed more differentially expressed genes in Q4359 than in Q4646 compared to N22. Most genes differing between Q4646 and N22 also differed between Q4359 and N22. GO analysis of genes differentially expressed in both Q4359 and Q4646 revealed that some genes such as those for starch biosynthesis were repressed, whereas metabolic genes such as those for carbohydrate metabolism were enhanced in Q4359 and Q4646 seeds relative to N22. Expression of some genes involved in cell redox homeostasis and chromatin remodeling differed significantly only between Q4359 and N22. The results suggested a close correlation between cell redox homeostasis, chromatin remodeling and seed dormancy. In addition, some genes involved in ABA signaling were down-regulated, and several genes involved in GA biosynthesis and signaling were up-regulated. These observations suggest that reduced seed dormancy in Q4359 was regulated by ABA-GA antagonism. A few differentially expressed genes were located in the regions containing qSdn-1 and qSdn-5 suggesting that they could be candidate genes underlying seed dormancy. Our work provides useful leads to further determine the underling mechanisms of seed dormancy and for cloning seed dormancy genes from N22.
26719746	Evaluation of genetic variation among wild rice populations in Cambodia.	2015	Breed Sci	A total of 448 samples in five natural populations of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) were collected in Cambodia. They were examined using 12 SSR and two chloroplast markers to evaluate the degree of variation among populations and the genetic structure within populations. In the two annual populations, the number of plants with homozygous alleles at all 12 SSR loci were high (66.3% and 79.5%), suggesting that these plants propagate mainly through self-pollination. In the three perennial populations, no individuals had all homozygous genotypes, but redundant genotypes resulted from clonal propagation were observed. Percentages of the redundant genotypes were highly varied (3.6%, 29.2% and 86.0%). This may be due to the different stable levels of environmental conditions. As for chloroplast genome, most of the wild plants showed the same chloroplast types as most Indica-type cultivars have. However, plants with different chloroplast types were maintained, even in the same population. In tropical Asian countries, many wild rice populations were observed under similar ecological conditions examined in this study. Therefore, the present results concerning population structure will be important to further elucidate genetic features of wild rice, and will also give strong clues to utilize and conserve wild natural genetic resources.
26660729	A transgenic, visual screenable marker for soybean seeds.	2016	Transgenic Res	Most soybean cultivars produce buff colored seeds due to a seed coat specific siRNA mechanism. This phenomenon is specifically limited to the seed coat and produces a strong visual effect, thus, a strategy to evade the silencing was used to produce a maternal transgenic marker for soybeans. Expression of a rice chalcone synthase transgene with little DNA sequence homology to the soybean siRNAs resulted in dark colored seed coats. This phenotype is the result of anthocyanin pigment production and does not appear to affect other tissues. This novel approach for producing an easily scored transgenic marker for soybean will facilitate high-throughput screening and analysis of transgenic soybean.
26639303	SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	New Phytol	As a key epigenetic modification, the methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) modulates chromatin structure and is involved in diverse biological processes. To better understand the language of H3K36 methylation in rice (Oryza sativa), we chose potential histone methylation enzymes for functional exploration. In particular, we characterized rice SET DOMAIN GROUP 708 (SDG708) as an H3K36-specific methyltransferase possessing the ability to deposit up to three methyl groups on H3K36. Compared with the wild-type, SDG708-knockdown rice mutants displayed a late-flowering phenotype under both long-day and short-day conditions because of the down-regulation of the key flowering regulatory genes Heading date 3a (Hd3a), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1), and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that H3K36me1, H3K36me2, and H3K36me3 levels were reduced at these loci in SDG708-deficient plants. More importantly, SDG708 was able to directly target and effect H3K36 methylation on specific flowering genes. In fact, knockdown of SDG708 led to misexpression of a set of functional genes and a genome-wide decrease in H3K36me1/2/3 levels during the early growth stages of rice. SDG708 is a methyltransferase that catalyses genome-wide deposition of all three methyl groups on H3K36 and is involved in many biological processes in addition to flowering promotion.
26643073	Down-Regulation of Cytokinin Oxidase 2 Expression Increases Tiller Number and Improves Rice Yield.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Cytokinins are plant-specific hormones that affect plant growth and development. The endogenous level of cytokinins in plant cells is regulated in part by irreversible degradation via cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX). Among the 11 rice CKXs, CKX2 has been implicated in regulation of rice grain yield.

RESULTS: To specifically down-regulate OsCKX2 expression, we have chosen two conserved glycosylation regions of OsCKX2 for designing artificial short hairpin RNA interference genes (shRNA-CX3 and -CX5, representing the 5' and 3' glycosylation region sequences, respectively) for transformation by the Agrobacterium-mediated method. For each construct, 5 independent transgenic lines were obtained for detailed analysis. Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of the shRNA genes into the rice genome, and quantitative real time RT-PCR and northern blot analyses showed reduced OsCKX2 expression in the young stem of transgenic rice at varying degrees. However, the expression of other rice CKX genes, such as CKX1 and CKX3, in these transgenic lines was not altered. Transgenic rice plants grown in the greenhouse were greener and more vigorous with delayed senescence, compared to the wild type. In field experiments, both CX3 and CX5 transgenic rice plants produced more tillers (27-81 %) and grains (24-67 %) per plant and had a heavier 1000 grain weight (5-15 %) than the wild type. The increases in grain yield were highly correlated with increased tiller numbers. Consistently, insertional activation of OsCKX2 led to increased expression of CKX2 and reduced tiller number and growth in a gene-dosage dependant manner.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate that specific suppression of OsCKX2 expression through shRNA-mediated gene silencing leads to enhanced growth and productivity in rice by increasing tiller number and grain weight.
26685666	BRITTLE SHEATH1 encoding OsCYP96B4 is involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Mutation of BSH1 leads to brittle sheath phenotype and reduction of very-long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives in wax. The cell wall plays an important role in plant mechanical strength. Several brittle culm mutants have been identified and characterized in rice. Here, we characterized an anther culture-derived rice brittle sheath mutant, named bsh1 and isolated BSH1 via map-based strategy. BSH1 encodes OsCYP96B4 protein, which was localized on ER membrane in the protoplast transient assay. BSH1 is mainly expressed in developing vascular tissues and the cells in which cell wall secondary thickening is occurring. Mutation in bsh1 causes changes in cell wall composition by affecting the expression of cell wall-related genes. Moreover, bsh1 shows reduced amounts of very-long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives in wax rather than the medium-chain fatty acids. In summary, BSH1 functions mainly in secondary cell wall formation, and probably in wax biosynthesis in an unidentified mechanism.
26668331	A Defect in DNA Ligase4 Enhances the Frequency of TALEN-Mediated Targeted Mutagenesis in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	We have established methods for site-directed mutagenesis via transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in the endogenous rice (Oryza sativa) waxy gene and demonstrated stable inheritance of TALEN-induced somatic mutations to the progeny. To analyze the role of classical nonhomologous end joining (cNHEJ) and alternative nonhomologous end joining (altNHEJ) pathways in TALEN-induced mutagenesis in plant cells, we investigated whether a lack of DNA Ligase4 (Lig4) affects the kinetics of TALEN-induced double-strand break repair in rice cells. Deep-sequencing analysis revealed that the frequency of all types of mutations, namely deletion, insertion, combination of insertion with deletion, and substitution, in lig4 null mutant calli was higher than that in a lig4 heterozygous mutant or the wild type. In addition, the ratio of large deletions (greater than 10 bp) and deletions repaired by microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) to total deletion mutations in lig4 null mutant calli was higher than that in the lig4 heterozygous mutant or wild type. Furthermore, almost all insertions (2 bp or greater) were shown to be processed via copy and paste of one or more regions around the TALENs cleavage site and rejoined via MMEJ regardless of genetic background. Taken together, our findings indicate that the dysfunction of cNHEJ leads to a shift in the repair pathway from cNHEJ to altNHEJ or synthesis-dependent strand annealing.
26642184	Mutualistic fungal endophytes produce phytohormones and organic acids that promote japonica rice plant growth under prolonged heat stress.	2015	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	This study identifies the potential role in heat-stress mitigation of phytohormones and other secondary metabolites produced by the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces formosus LWL1 in japonica rice cultivar Dongjin. The japonica rice was grown in controlled chamber conditions with and without P. formosus LWL1 under no stress (NS) and prolonged heat stress (HS) conditions. Endophytic association under NS and HS conditions significantly improved plant growth attributes, such as plant height, fresh weight, dry weight, and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, P. formosus LWL1 protected the rice plants from HS compared with controls, indicated by the lower endogenous level of stress-signaling compounds such as abscisic acid (25.71%) and jasmonic acid (34.57%) and the increase in total protein content (18.76%-33.22%). Such fungal endophytes may be helpful for sustainable crop production under high environmental temperatures.
26655677	Gel-free/label-free proteomic analysis of developing rice grains under heat stress.	2016	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: High temperature markedly reduces the yields and quality of rice grains. To identify the mechanisms underlying heat stress-induced responses in rice grains, proteomic technique was used. Developing Khao Dawk Mali 105 rice grains at the milky, dough, and mature stages were treated at 40 °C for 3 days. Aromatic compounds were decreased in rice grains under heat stress. The protein abundance involved in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, was changed in milky and dough grains after heat treatment; however, none changes in mature grains. The abundance involved in amino acid metabolism was increased in dough grains, but decreased in milky grains. In addition, the abundance involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, such as starch synthase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, granule-bound starch synthase, and alpha amylase, was decreased in milky grains, but increased in dough grains. A number of redox homeostasis-related proteins, such as ascorbate peroxidase and peroxiredoxin, were increased in developing rice grains treated with heat stress. These results suggest that in response to heat stress, the abundance of numerous proteins involved in redox homeostasis and carbohydrate biosynthetic pathways may play a major role in the development of KDML105 rice grains.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Yield of Khao Dawk Mali 105 rice, which is an economical aromatic rice, was disrupted by environmental stress. Rice grains developed under heat stress caused loss of aroma compound. To identify the mechanism of heat response in rice grain, gel-free/label-free proteomic technique was used. The abundance of proteins involved in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle was disrupted by heat stress. High temperature limited starch biosynthesis; however, it enhanced sugar biosynthesis in developing rice grains. Redox homeostasis related proteins were disrupted by heat stress. These results suggest that proteins involved in redox homeostasis and carbohydrate pathway might play a major role in developing grains in Khao Dawk Mali 105 rice under heat stress.
26685185	Ectopic expression of TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 affects ovule development in Arabidopsis.	2016	J Exp Bot	Plants have evolved to extensively employ leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), the largest family of RLKs, to control growth, development, and defense. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES1 (EMS1) LRR-RLK and its potential small protein ligand TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) are specifically required for anther cell differentiation; however, TPD1 and EMS1 orthologs also control megaspore mother cell proliferation in rice and maize ovules. Here, the molecular function of TPD1 was demonstrated during ovule development in Arabidopsis using a gain-of-function approach. In ovules, the EMS1 gene was primarily expressed in nucellus epidermis and chalaza, whereas the expression of TPD1 was weakly restricted to the distal end of integuments. Ectopic expression of TPD1 caused pleiotropic defects in ovule and seed development. RNA sequencing analysis showed that ectopic expression of TPD1 altered expression of auxin signaling genes and core cell-cycle genes during ovule development. Moreover, ectopic expression of TPD1 not only affected auxin response but also enhanced expression of cyclin genes CYCD3;3 and CYCA2;3 in ovules. Thus, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which TPD1-EMS1 signaling controls plant development possibly via regulation of auxin signaling and cell-cycle genes.
26719053	Bioinformatic landscapes for plant transcription factor system research.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Diverse bioinformatic resources have been developed for plant transcription factor (TF) research. This review presents the bioinformatic resources and methodologies for the elucidation of plant TF-mediated biological events. Such information is helpful to dissect the transcriptional regulatory systems in the three reference plants Arabidopsis , rice, and maize and translation to other plants. Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate diverse biological programs by the modulation of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression via binding cis-regulatory elements. Advanced sequencing platforms accompanied by emerging bioinformatic tools revolutionize the scope and extent of TF research. The system-level integration of bioinformatic resources is beneficial to the decoding of TF-involved networks. Herein, we first briefly introduce general and specialized databases for TF research in three reference plants Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. Then, as proof of concept, we identified and characterized heat shock transcription factor (HSF) members through the TF databases. Finally, we present how the integration of bioinformatic resources at -omics layers can aid the dissection of TF-mediated pathways. We also suggest ways forward to improve the bioinformatic resources of plant TFs. Leveraging these bioinformatic resources and methodologies opens new avenues for the elucidation of transcriptional regulatory systems in the three model systems and translation to other plants.
26054239	Forward screening for seedling tolerance to Fe toxicity reveals a polymorphic mutation in ferric chelate reductase in rice.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice contains the lowest grain Fe content among cereals. One biological limiting factor is the tolerance of rice to Fe toxicity. Reverse and forward genetic screenings were used to identify tolerance to Fe toxicity in 4,500 M4 lines irradiated by fast neutrons (FN).

FINDINGS: Fe-tolerant mutants were successfully isolated. In the forward screen, we selected five highly tolerant and four highly intolerant mutants based on the response of seedlings to 300 ppm Fe. Reverse screening based on the polymorphic coding sequence of seven Fe homeostatic genes detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) revealed MuFRO1, a mutant for OsFRO1 (LOC_Os04g36720). The MuFRO1 mutant tolerated Fe toxicity in the vegetative stage and had 21-30% more grain Fe content than its wild type. All five highly Fe-tolerant mutants have the same haplotype as the MuFRO1, confirming the important role of OsFRO1 in Fe homeostasis in rice.

CONCLUSIONS: FN radiation generated extreme Fe-tolerant mutants capable of tolerating different levels of Fe toxicity in the lowland rice environment. Mutants from both reverse and forward screens suggested a role for OsFRO1 in seedling tolerance to Fe toxicity. The MuFRO1 mutant could facilitate rice production in the high-Fe soil found in Southeast Asia.
26663822	Maintenance of meristem activity under stress: is there an interplay of RSS1-like proteins with the RBR pathway?	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Plants have acquired rapid responses to a constantly changing environment. These adaptive and protective responses are the result of a complex signalling network regulating different aspects, ranging from ion homeostasis to cell cycle control. It is well established that stress inhibits cell division, which negatively impacts plant growth and development and hence results in biomass decrease and yield loss. Therefore understanding the link between stress perception and cell cycle control would allow development of new crops with increased productivity when subjected to stress. However, studies on cell cycle control under stress have been limited to well-known regulators of the cell cycle such as cyclins and stress-related phytohormone integrators. The recent discovery of RSS1, a novel intrinsically unstructured protein of rice, opened up new insights into how stress perception can be connected with cell cycle control in meristematic zones. Whereas RSS1 is well conserved among other plant lineages, eudicots present proteins sharing little sequence homology with RSS1. Here, we discuss how RSS1-like proteins might also be functional in dicots, and possibly act through the retinoblastoma-related pathway to regulate both S-phase transition and cell fate in meristems.
26697049	Chitin Nanofiber Elucidates the Elicitor Activity of Polymeric Chitin in Plants.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Chitin, an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine polymer, is a component of fungal cell walls and a microbe/pathogen-associated molecular pattern that elicits plant defense responses. As polymeric chitin is difficult to handle due to its insolubility in water, many studies on chitin-induced immune responses have used water-soluble low-molecular weight chitin instead. Thus, it is unclear if polymeric chitin can induce resistance. Here, we examined the elicitor activity of chitin nanofiber (CNF) of submicron thickness prepared from polymeric chitin. CNF showed a high dispersing ability in water and induced both reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and chitin-induced defense-related gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The Arabidopsis chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (Atcerk1) mutant, which is impaired in chitin perception, also failed to respond to CNF. CNF exposure triggered ROS generation in suspension-cultured cells from Oryza sativa. Furthermore, pre-treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with CNF effectively reduced pathogen infection by both the fungus Alternaria brassicicola and the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. These results demonstrate that CNF has elicitor activity and will help define the role of polymeric chitin in plant immune responses.
26634524	Morphology and photosynthetic enzyme activity of maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase transgenic rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	The morphology and photosynthetic enzyme activity were studied in maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase transgenic rice and non-transgenic rice. The results showed that compared with non-transgenic rice, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase transgenic rice was taller and had a stronger stalk, wider leaves, and more exuberant root system, with increased photosynthetic enzyme activity and improved yield components. Therefore, given the superiority of this plant type and heterosis, this is a novel breeding strategy for rice for the introduction of C4 photosynthesis genes into high-yielding rice.
26677125	Artificial Selection of Gn1a Plays an Important role in Improving Rice Yields Across Different Ecological Regions.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most important crops, and it is essential to improve rice productivity to satisfy the future global food supply demands. Gn1a (OsCKX2), which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, plays an important role in regulating rice grain yield.

RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation of Gn1a, which influences grain yield through controlling the number of spikelets in rice. The allelic variations in the promoter, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) of Gn1a were investigated in 175 cultivars and 21 wild rice accessions. We found that Gn1a showed less sequence variation in the cultivars, but exhibited significant nucleotide diversity in wild rice. A total of 14 alleles, named AP1 to AP14, were identified in the cultivars based on the amino acid divergence of GN1A. Association analysis revealed that the number of spikelets and grain yield were significantly different between the different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three main alleles, AP3, AP8 and AP9, in the cultivars might originate from a common ancestor allele, AP1, in wild rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Of these alleles in the cultivars, AP9 was suggested as the best allele in indica, as it has shown strong artificial selection in breeding high-yield rice in the past. It might be valuable to explore the high-yield-related alleles of Gn1a to develop high-yield rice cultivars in future breeding programs.
26054238	A receptor like kinase gene with expressional responsiveness on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is essential for Xa21-mediated disease resistance.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent a large class of proteins in regulating plant development and immunity. The LRR-RLK XA21 confers resistance to the bacterial disease caused by the pathogen of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Several XA21 binding proteins have been characterized, however the early events governing XA21 signaling have not been fully elucidated.

RESULTS: Here we report the identification of one LRR-RLK gene (XIK1) whose expression is induced rapidly upon the infection with the pathogen of Xoo. Expression pattern analysis reveals that XIK1 is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development. By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21. In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for XIK1.

CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that the LRR-RLK gene XIK1 is Xoo-responsive and positively regulates Xa21-mediated disease resistance.
26633387	Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the VQ Motif-Containing Protein Family in Chinese Cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. Pekinensis).	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Previous studies have showed that the VQ motif-containing proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa play an important role in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, little is known about the functions of the VQ genes in Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage). In this study, we performed genome-wide identification, characterization, and expression analysis of the VQ genes in Chinese cabbage, especially under adverse environment. We identified 57 VQ genes and classified them into seven subgroups (I-VII), which were dispersedly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 10. The expansion of these genes mainly contributed to segmental and tandem duplication. Fifty-four VQ genes contained no introns and 50 VQ proteins were less than 300 amino acids in length. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the VQ genes were differentially expressed in various tissues and during different abiotic stresses and plant hormone treatments. This study provides a comprehensive overview of Chinese cabbage VQ genes and will benefit the molecular breeding for resistance to stresses and disease, as well as further studies on the biological functions of the VQ proteins.
26714258	Genome-Wide Association Study of Grain Appearance and Milling Quality in a Worldwide Collection of Indica Rice Germplasm.	2015	PLoS One	Grain appearance quality and milling quality are the main determinants of market value of rice. Breeding for improved grain quality is a major objective of rice breeding worldwide. Identification of genes/QTL controlling quality traits is the prerequisite for increasing breeding efficiency through marker-assisted selection. Here, we reported a genome-wide association study in indica rice to identify QTL associated with 10 appearance and milling quality related traits, including grain length, grain width, grain length to width ratio, grain thickness, thousand grain weight, degree of endosperm chalkiness, percentage of grains with chalkiness, brown rice rate, milled rice rate and head milled rice rate. A diversity panel consisting of 272 indica accessions collected worldwide was evaluated in four locations including Hangzhou, Jingzhou, Sanya and Shenzhen representing indica rice production environments in China and genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and Diversity Arrays Technology based on next-generation sequencing technique called DArTseq™. A wide range of variation was observed for all traits in all environments. A total of 16 different association analysis models were compared to determine the best model for each trait-environment combination. Association mapping based on 18,824 high quality markers yielded 38 QTL for the 10 traits. Five of the detected QTL corresponded to known genes or fine mapped QTL. Among the 33 novel QTL identified, qDEC1.1 (qGLWR1.1), qBRR2.2 (qGL2.1), qTGW2.1 (qGL2.2), qGW11.1 (qMRR11.1) and qGL7.1 affected multiple traits with relatively large effects and/or were detected in multiple environments. The research provided an insight of the genetic architecture of rice grain quality and important information for mining genes/QTL with large effects within indica accessions for rice breeding.
26641488	Application of Brown Planthopper Salivary Gland Extract to Rice Plants Induces Systemic Host mRNA Patterns Associated with Nutrient Remobilization.	2015	PLoS One	Insect saliva plays an important role in modulation of plant-insect interactions. Although this area of research has generated much attention in recent years, mechanisms of how saliva affects plant responses remain poorly understood. To address this void, the present study investigated the impact of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens, Stål; hereafter BPH) salivary gland extract (SGE) on rice (Oryza sativa) systemic responses at the mRNA level. Differentially expressed rice mRNAs were generated through suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and classified into six functional groups. Those with the most representatives were from the primary metabolism (28%), signaling-defense (22%) and transcription-translation-regulation group (16%). To validate SSH library results, six genes were further analyzed by One-Step Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR. Five of these genes exhibited up-regulation levels of more than 150% of those in the control group in at least one post-application time point. Results of this study allow assignment of at least two putative roles of BPH saliva: First, application of SGE induces immediate systemic responses at the mRNA level, suggesting that altering of the rice transcriptome at sites distant to hoppers feeding locations may play an important role in BPH-rice interactions. Second, 58% of SGE-responsive up-regulated genes have a secondary function associated with senescence, a process characterized by remobilization of nutrients. This suggests that BPH salivary secretions may reprogram the rice transcriptome for nutritional enhancement. When these findings are translated onto 'whole plant' scale, they indicate that BPH saliva may play the 'wise investment' role of 'minimum input today, maximum output tomorrow'.
26688693	The making of a genomic parasite - the Mothra family sheds light on the evolution of Helitrons in plants.	2015	Mob DNA	BACKGROUND: Helitrons are Class II transposons which are highly abundant in almost all eukaryotes. However, most Helitrons lack protein coding sequence. These non-autonomous elements are thought to hijack recombinase/helicase (RepHel) and possibly further enzymes from related, autonomous elements. Interestingly, many plant Helitrons contain an additional gene encoding a single-strand binding protein homologous to Replication Factor A (RPA), a highly conserved, single-copy gene found in all eukaryotes.

RESULTS: Here, we describe the analysis of DHH_Mothra, a high-copy non-autonomous Helitron in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa). Mothra has a low GC-content and consists of two distinct blocs of tandem repeats. Based on homology between their termini, we identified a putative mother element which encodes an RPA-like protein but has no RepHel gene. Additionally, we found a putative autonomous sister-family with strong homology to the Mothra mother element in the RPA protein and terminal sequences, which we propose provides the RepHel domain for the Mothra family. Furthermore, we phylogenetically analyzed the evolutionary history of RPA-like proteins. Interestingly, plant Helitron RPAs (PHRPAs) are only found in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and they form a monophyletic group which branched off before the eukaryotic "core" RPAs.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data show how erosion of autonomous Helitrons can lead to different "levels" of autonomy within Helitron families and can create highly successful subfamilies of non-autonomous elements. Most importantly, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the PHRPA gene was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from an unknown eukaryotic donor at least 145-300 million years ago in the common ancestor of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. This might have led to the evolution of a separate branch of the Helitron superfamily in plants.
26714321	Using RNA-seq to Profile Gene Expression of Spikelet Development in Response to Temperature and Nitrogen during Meiosis in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Rice reproductive development is sensitive to high temperature and soil nitrogen supply, both of which are predicted to be increased threats to rice crop yield. Rice spikelet development is a critical process that determines yield, yet little is known about the transcriptional regulation of rice spikelet development in response to the combination of heat stress and low nitrogen availability. Here, we profiled gene expression of rice spikelet development during meiosis under heat stress and different nitrogen levels using RNA-seq. We subjected plants to four treatments: 1) NN: normal nitrogen level (165 kg ha-1) with normal temperature (30°C); 2) HH: high nitrogen level (264 kg ha-1) with high temperature (37°C); 3) NH: normal nitrogen level and high temperature; and 4) HN: high nitrogen level and normal temperature. The de novo transcriptome assembly resulted in 52,250,482 clean reads aligned with 76,103 unigenes, which were then used to compare differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the different treatments. Comparing gene expression in samples with the same nitrogen levels but different temperatures, we identified 70 temperature-responsive DEGs in normal nitrogen levels (NN vs NH) and 135 DEGs in high nitrogen levels (HN vs HH), with 27 overlapping DEGs. We identified 17 and seven nitrogen-responsive DEGs by comparing changes in nitrogen levels in lower temperature (NN vs HN) and higher temperature (NH vs HH), with one common DEG. The temperature-responsive genes were principally associated with cytochrome, heat shock protein, peroxidase, and ubiquitin, while the nitrogen-responsive genes were mainly involved in glutamine synthetase, amino acid transporter, pollen development, and plant hormone. Rice spikelet fertility was significantly reduced under high temperature, but less reduced under high-nitrogen treatment. In the high temperature treatments, we observed downregulation of genes involved in spikelet development, such as pollen tube growth, pollen maturation, especially sporopollenin biosynthetic process, and pollen exine formation. Moreover, we observed higher expression levels of the co-expressed DEGs in HN vs HH compared to NN vs NH. These included the six downregulated genes (one pollen maturation and five pollen exine formation genes), as well as the four upregulated DEGs in response to heat. This suggests that high-nitrogen treatment may enhance the gene expression levels to mitigate aspects of heat-stress. The spikelet genes identified in this study may play important roles in response to the combined effects of high temperature and high nitrogen, and may serve as candidates for crop improvement.
26633389	Omics-Based Comparative Transcriptional Profiling of Two Contrasting Rice Genotypes during Early Infestation by Small Brown Planthopper.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	The small brown planthopper (SBPH) is one of the destructive pests of rice. Although different biochemical pathways that are involved in rice responding to planthopper infestation have been documented, it is unclear which individual metabolic pathways are responsive to planthopper infestation. In this study, an omics-based comparative transcriptional profiling of two contrasting rice genotypes, an SBPH-resistant and an SBPH-susceptible rice line, was assessed for rice individual metabolic pathways responsive to SBPH infestation. When exposed to SBPH, 166 metabolic pathways were differentially regulated; of these, more than one-third of metabolic pathways displayed similar change patterns between these two contrasting rice genotypes; the difference of change pattern between these two contrasting rice genotypes mostly lies in biosynthetic pathways and the obvious difference of change pattern lies in energy metabolism pathways. Combining the Pathway Tools Omics Viewer with the web tool Venn, 21 and 6 metabolic pathways which potentially associated with SBPH resistance and susceptibility, respectively were identified. This study presents an omics-based comparative transcriptional profiling of SBPH-resistant and SBPH-susceptible rice plants during early infestation by SBPH, which will be very informative in studying rice-insect interaction. The results will provide insight into how rice plants respond to early infestation by SBPH from the biochemical pathways perspective.
26708605	Rice Stomatal Closure Requires Guard Cell Plasma Membrane ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter RCN1/OsABCG5.	2016	Mol Plant	Water stress is one of the major environmental stresses that affect agricultural production worldwide. Water loss from plants occurs primarily through stomatal pores. Here, we report that an Oryza sativa half-size ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G protein, RCN1/OsABCG5, is involved in stomatal closure mediated by phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in guard cells. We found that the GFP-RCN1/OsABCG5-fusion protein was localized at the plasma membrane in guard cells. The percentage of guard cell pairs containing both ABA and GFP-RCN1/OsABCG5 increased after exogenous ABA treatment, whereas they were co-localized in guard cell pairs regardless of whether exogenous ABA was applied. ABA application resulted in a smaller increase in the percentage of guard cell pairs containing ABA in rcn1 mutant (A684P) and RCN1-RNAi than in wild-type plants. Furthermore, polyethylene glycol (drought stress)-inducible ABA accumulation in guard cells did not occur in rcn1 mutants. Stomata closure mediated by exogenous ABA application was strongly reduced in rcn1 mutants. Finally, rcn1 mutant plants had more rapid water loss from detached leaves than the wild-type plants. These results indicate that in response to drought stress, RCN1/OsABCG5 is involved in accumulation of ABA in guard cells, which is indispensable for stomatal closure.
26054242	Delving deeper into technological innovations to understand differences in rice quality.	2015	Rice (N Y)	Increasing demand for better quality rice varieties, which are also more suited to growth under sub-optimal cultivation conditions, is driving innovation in rice research. Here we have used a multi-disciplinary approach, involving SNP-based genotyping together with phenotyping based on yield analysis, metabolomic analysis of grain volatiles, and sensory panel analysis to determine differences between two contrasting rice varieties, Apo and IR64. Plants were grown under standard and drought-induced conditions. Results revealed important differences between the volatile profiles of the two rice varieties and we relate these differences to those perceived by the sensory panel. Apo, which is the more drought tolerant variety, was less affected by the drought condition concerning both sensory profile and yield; IR64, which has higher quality but is drought sensitive, showed greater differences in these characteristics in response to the two growth conditions. Metabolomics analyses using GCxGC-MS, followed by multivariate statistical analyses of the data, revealed a number of discriminatory compounds between the varieties, but also effects of the difference in cultivation conditions. Results indicate the complexity of rice volatile profile, even of non-aromatic varieties, and how metabolomics can be used to help link changes in aroma profile with the sensory phenotype. Our outcomes also suggest valuable multi-disciplinary approaches which can be used to help define the aroma profile in rice, and its underlying genetic background, in order to support breeders in the generation of improved rice varieties combining high yield with high quality, and tolerance of both these traits to climate change.
26687860	Inconsistent diversities between nuclear and plastid genomes of AA genome species in the genus Oryza.	2015	Genes Genet Syst	AA genome species in the genus Oryza are valuable resources for improvement of cultivated rice. Oryza rufipogon and O. barthii were progenitors of two domesticated rice species, O. sativa and O. glaberrima, respectively. We used chloroplast single-nucleotide repeats (RCt1-10) to evaluate genetic diversity among AA genome species. Higher diversity was detected in the American species O. glumaepatula and the Asian species O. rufipogon. Other chloroplast sequences indicated that O. glumaepatula shares high similarity with O. longistaminata. Insertions of retrotransposable elements, however, showed a close relation between O. barthii and O. glumaepatula. To clarify phylogenetic relationships among AA genomes, whole-genome sequences obtained from different species were used to develop chloroplast INDEL markers. The INDEL patterns clearly showed multiple maternal origins of O. glumaepatula. The complicated origins have resulted in high genetic diversity in this species. In contrast, the Australian endemic species O. meridionalis tended to show narrower diversity than the other species. High variation in O. rufipogon, reconfirmed using the chloroplast INDELs, covered the variation in O. meridionalis and part of the variation in O. glumaepatula. Maternal lineages including O. barthii, O. longistaminata and the remainder of O. glumaepatula were phylogenetically close to each other and carried low genetic diversity. They were separated from independent lineages, suggesting that they had diverged from a single ancestral maternal lineage, but diverged later to keep gene flow within respective species, as SSR compositions suggested. Genetic relationships among AA genome species indicate how these species have evolved and become distributed across four continents.
26674966	CaPUB1, a Hot Pepper U-box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Confers Enhanced Cold Stress Tolerance and Decreased Drought Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Mol Cells	Abiotic stresses such as drought and low temperature critically restrict plant growth, reproduction, and productivity. Higher plants have developed various defense strategies against these unfavorable conditions. CaPUB1 (Capsicum annuum Putative U-box protein 1) is a hot pepper U-box E3 Ub ligase. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed CaPUB1 exhibited drought-sensitive phenotypes, suggesting that it functions as a negative regulator of the drought stress response. In this study, CaPUB1 was over-expressed in rice (Oryza sativa L.), and the phenotypic properties of transgenic rice plants were examined in terms of their drought and cold stress tolerance. Ubi:CaPUB1 T3 transgenic rice plants displayed phenotypes hypersensitive to dehydration, suggesting that its role in the negative regulation of drought stress response is conserved in dicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice plants. In contrast, Ubi:CaPUB1 progeny exhibited phenotypes markedly tolerant to prolonged low temperature (4°C) treatment, compared to those of wild-type plants, as determined by survival rates, electrolyte leakage, and total chlorophyll content. Cold stress-induced marker genes, including DREB1A, DREB1B, DREB1C, and Cytochrome P450, were more up-regulated by cold treatment in Ubi:CaPUB1 plants than in wild-type plants. These results suggest that CaPUB1 serves as both a negative regulator of the drought stress response and a positive regulator of the cold stress response in transgenic rice plants. This raises the possibility that CaPUB1 participates in the cross-talk between drought and low-temperature signaling pathways.
26668334	Biallelic Gene Targeting in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) have been used successfully in homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated gene targeting (GT) in many organisms. However, break-induced GT in plants remains challenging due to inefficient delivery of HDR templates and SSNs into plant nuclei. In many plants, including rice, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most practical means of transformation because this biotic transformation system can deliver longer and more intact DNA payloads with less incorporation of fragmented DNA compared with physical transformation systems such as polyethylene glycol, electroporation, or biolistics. Following infection with Agrobacterium, transfer of transfer DNA (T-DNA) to the nucleus and its integration into the plant genome occur consecutively during cocultivation, thus timing the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) on the target gene to coincide with the delivery of the HDR template is crucial. To synchronize DSB induction and delivery of the HDR template, we transformed a Cas9 expression construct and GT vector harboring the HDR template with guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the rice acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene either separately or sequentially into rice calli. When gRNAs targeting ALS were transcribed transiently from double-stranded T-DNA containing the HDR template, DSBs were induced in the ALS locus by the assembled Cas9/gRNA complex and homologous recombination was stimulated. Contrary to our expectations, there was no great difference in GT efficiency between Cas9-expressing and nonexpressing cells. However, when gRNA targeting DNA ligase 4 was transformed with Cas9 prior to the GT experiment, GT efficiency increased dramatically and more than one line exhibiting biallelic GT at the ALS locus was obtained.
26689769	WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene WOX11 increases rice drought resistance by controlling root hair formation and root system development.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Roots are essential organs for anchoring plants, exploring and exploiting soil resources, and establishing plant-microorganisms communities in vascular plants. Rice has a complex root system architecture consisting of several root types, including primary roots, lateral roots, and crown roots. Crown roots constitute the major part of the rice root system and play important roles during the growing period. Recently, we have refined a mechanism that involves ERF3/WOX11 interaction is required to regulate the expression of genes in the cytokinin signaling pathway during the different stages of crown roots development in rice. In this study, we further analyzed the root phenotypes of WOX11 transgenic plants and revealed that WOX11 also acts in controlling root hair development and enhancing rice drought resistance, in addition to its roles in regulating crown root and lateral root development. Based on this new finding, we proposed the mechanism of that WOX11 is involved in drought resistance by modulating rice root system development.
26713754	Metabolic Profiling and Physiological Analysis of a Novel Rice Introgression Line with Broad Leaf Size.	2015	PLoS One	A rice introgression line, NIL-SS1, and its recurrent parent, Teqing, were used to investigate the influence of the introgression segment on plant growth. The current research showed NIL-SS1 had an increased flag leaf width, total leaf area, spikelet number per panicle and grain yield, but a decreased photosynthetic rate. The metabolite differences in NIL-SS1 and Teqing at different developmental stages were assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technology. Significant metabolite differences were observed across the different stages. NIL-SS1 increased the plant leaf nitrogen content, and the greatest differences between NIL-SS1 and Teqing occurred at the booting stage. Compared to Teqing, the metabolic phenotype of NIL-SS1 at the booting stage has closer association with those at the flowering stage. The introgression segment induced more active competition for sugars and organic acids (OAs) from leaves to the growing young spikes, which resulted in more spikelet number per plant (SNP). The results indicated the introgression segment could improve rice grain yield by increasing the SNP and total leaf area per plant, which resulted from the higher plant nitrogen content across growth stages and stronger competition for sugars and OAs of young spikes at the booting stage.
26713764	Identification and Fine Mapping of a Stably Expressed QTL for Cold Tolerance at the Booting Stage Using an Interconnected Breeding Population in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Cold stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that impede rice production. A interconnected breeding (IB) population consisted of 497 advanced lines developed using HHZ as the recurrent parent and eight diverse elite indica lines as the donors were used to identify stably expressed QTLs for CT at the booting stage. A total of 41,754 high-quality SNPs were obtained through re-sequencing of the IB population. Phenotyping was conducted under field conditions in two years and three locations. Association analysis identified six QTLs for CT on the chromosomes 3, 4 and 12. QTL qCT-3-2 that showed stable CT across years and locations was fine-mapped to an approximately 192.9 kb region. Our results suggested that GWAS applied to an IB population allows better integration of gene discovery and breeding. QTLs can be mapped in high resolution and quickly utilized in breeding.
26648962	Crucial Roles of Abscisic Acid Biogenesis in Virulence of Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Rice suffers dramatic yield losses due to blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Pseudomonas chlororaphis EA105, a bacterium that was isolated from the rice rhizosphere, inhibits M. oryzae. It was shown previously that pre-treatment of rice with EA105 reduced the size of blast lesions through jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene (ETH)-mediated ISR. Abscisic acid (ABA) acts antagonistically toward salicylic acid (SA), JA, and ETH signaling, to impede plant defense responses. EA105 may be reducing the virulence of M. oryzae by preventing the pathogen from up-regulating the key ABA biosynthetic gene NCED3 in rice roots, as well as a β-glucosidase likely involved in activating conjugated inactive forms of ABA. However, changes in total ABA concentrations were not apparent, provoking the question of whether ABA concentration is an indicator of ABA signaling and response. In the rice-M. oryzae interaction, ABA plays a dual role in disease severity by increasing plant susceptibility and accelerating pathogenesis in the fungus itself. ABA is biosynthesized by M. oryzae. Further, exogenous ABA increased spore germination and appressoria formation, distinct from other plant growth regulators. EA105, which inhibits appressoria formation, counteracted the virulence-promoting effects of ABA on M. oryzae. The role of endogenous fungal ABA in blast disease was confirmed through the inability of a knockout mutant impaired in ABA biosynthesis to form lesions on rice. Therefore, it appears that EA105 is invoking multiple strategies in its protection of rice from blast including direct mechanisms as well as those mediated through plant signaling. ABA is a molecule that is likely implicated in both tactics.
26708765	Demethylation of methylmercury in growing rice plants: An evidence of self-detoxification.	2016	Environ Pollut	Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that poses a serious threat to human and the environment. Rice was found as an important source for human exposure to Hg in some areas. In this study, the transportation and transformation of IHg and MeHg in rice plants exposed to IHg or MeHg were investigated. The IHg and MeHg concentrations in rice roots and shoots collected every five days were analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS and SR-XANES. When exposed to MeHg, the percent of IHg in rice roots and shoots increased while MeHg decreased significantly, suggesting prominent demethylation of MeHg occurred. However no notable MeHg was found in both roots and shoots of rice plant when exposed to IHg. SR-XANES analysis further confirmed the demethylation of MeHg with rice. This study provides a new finding that demethylation of MeHg could occur in growing rice, which may be a self-defense process of rice plant.
26696397	Characterization of N2-fixing plant growth promoting endophytic and epiphytic bacterial community of Indian cultivated and wild rice (Oryza spp.) genotypes.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The diversity of endophytic and epiphytic diazotrophs in different parts of rice plants has specificity to the niche (i.e. leaf, stem and root) of different genotypes and nutrient availability of the organ. Inoculation of the indigenous, polyvalent diazotrophs can facilitate and sustain production of non-leguminous crops like rice. Therefore, N2-fixing plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) were isolated from different parts of three Indian cultivated [Oryza sativa L. var. Sabita (semi deep/deep water)/Swarna (rain fed shallow lowland)/Swarna-Sub1(submergence tolerant)] and a wild (O. eichingeri) rice genotypes which respond differentially to nitrogenous fertilizers. Thirty-five isolates from four rice genotypes were categorized based on acetylene reduction assay on nitrogenase activity, biochemical tests, BIOLOG and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The bacteria produced 9.36-155.83 nmole C2H4 mg(-1) dry bacteria h(-1) and among them nitrogenase activity of 11 potent isolates was complemented by nifH-sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing divided them into five groups (shared 95-100 % sequence homology with type strains) belonging to five classes-alpha (Ancylobacter, Azorhizobium, Azospirillum, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Novosphingobium, spp.), beta (Burkholderia sp.), gamma (Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Azotobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas spp.) Proteobacteria, Bacilli (Bacillus, Paenibacillus spp.) and Actinobacteria (Microbacterium sp.). Besides, all bacterial strains possessed the intrinsic PGP traits of like indole (0.44-7.4 µg ml(-1)), ammonia (0.18-6 mmol ml(-1)), nitrite (0.01-3.4 mol ml(-1)), and siderophore (from 0.16-0.57 μmol ml(-1)) production. Inoculation of rice (cv. Swarna) seedlings with selected isolates had a positive impact on plant growth parameters like shoot and root elongation which was correlated with in vitro PGP attributes. The results indicated that the diverse polyvalent phytonic PGP bacteria, which may be exploited as bio-inoculants to improve rice production.
26719738	Overexpression of cold-inducible wheat galactinol synthase confers tolerance to chilling stress in transgenic rice.	2015	Breed Sci	Galactinol synthase (GolS) is considered to be a key regulator of the biosynthesis of Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs). Accumulation of RFOs has been reported to play a role in protection against abiotic stresses. We identified two cDNAs encoding galactinol synthase from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which we designated as TaGolS1 and TaGolS2. Expression of the two TaGolS genes was induced by cold stress but not by drought, heat stress or ABA treatment in wheat. We generated transgenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.) constitutively overexpressing TaGolS1 or TaGolS2. These transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher levels of galactinol and raffinose than did wild-type plants and exhibited enhanced cold-stress tolerance. The results demonstrate the involvement of galactinol and raffinose in the development of chilling stress in rice and indicate that the genetic modification of the biosynthesis of RFOs by transformation with GolS genes could be an effective method for enhancing chilling-stress tolerance in rice.
26671655	A novel PR10 promoter from Erianthus arundinaceus directs high constitutive transgene expression and is enhanced upon wounding in heterologous plant systems.	2016	Mol Biol Rep	In genetic engineering, inducible promoters play an important role as the expression of genes driven by them can be turned on or off under situations like biotic or abiotic factors. There are few reports on inducible promoters that can be employed in the development of transgenic plants, particularly in sugarcane. In the present study, four wound inducible genes (Chitinase, PR1A, PR10 and HRGP) were selected and were amplified from Erianthus arundinaceus, a distant relative of sugarcane. In order to determine the gene that is highly induced upon wounding, RT-qPCR was performed, which showed that PR10 gene expression was instantaneous and higher upon wounding when compared to the other three genes. Using the random amplification of genomic ends technique, a 592 bp promoter sequence was obtained and in silico analysis of the upstream regulatory region revealed a 469 bp promoter and 123 bp of 5' untranslated region (UTR). Functional analyses of the promoter sequence (with and without 5' UTR) in tobacco, rice and sugarcane using β-glucuronidase (GUS) as the reporter gene revealed the constitutive and inducible nature of the PR10 promoter. Our studies have demonstrated that the PR10 promoter, though highly constitutive, was quickly induced upon wounding as well as on treatment with abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate hormones. This is the first report on the isolation and characterization of a PR10 promoter from a wild grass and is expected to have application for development of transgenic plants.
26715311	Transcriptional profiling of the leaves of near-isogenic rice lines with contrasting drought tolerance at the reproductive stage in response to water deficit.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Drought tolerance is a complex quantitative trait that involves the coordination of a vast array of genes belonging to different pathways. To identify genes related to the drought-tolerance pathway in rice, we carried out gene-expression profiling of the leaves of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with similar genetic backgrounds and different set of QTLs but contrasting drought tolerance levels in response to long-term drought-stress treatments. This work will help differentiate mechanisms of tolerance in contrasting NILs and accelerate molecular breeding programs to improve drought tolerance in this crop.

RESULTS: The two pairs of rice NILs, developed at the International Rice Research Institute, along with the drought-susceptible parent, IR64, showed distinct gene-expression profiles in leaves under different water-deficit (WD) treatments. Drought tolerance in the highly drought-tolerant NIL (DTN), IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, could be attributed to the up-regulation of genes with calcium ion binding, transferase, hydrolase and transcription factor activities, whereas in the moderate DTN, IR77298-5-6-B-18, genes with transporter, catalytic and structural molecule activities were up-regulated under WD. In IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, the induced genes were characterized by the presence of regulatory motifs in their promoters, including TGGTTAGTACC and ([CT]AAC[GT]G){2}, which are specific to the TFIIIA and Myb transcription factors, respectively. In IR77298-5-6-B-18, promoters containing a GCAC[AG][ACGT][AT]TCCC[AG]A[ACGT]G[CT] motif, common to MADS(AP1), HD-ZIP, AP2 and YABBY, were induced, suggesting that these factors may play key roles in the regulation of drought tolerance in these two DTNs under severe WD.

CONCLUSIONS: We report here that the two pairs of NILs with different levels of drought tolerance may elucidate potential mechanisms and pathways through transcriptome data from leaf tissue. The present study serves as a resource for marker discovery and provides detailed insight into the gene-expression profiles of rice leaves, including the main functional categories of drought-responsive genes and the genes that are involved in drought-tolerance mechanisms, to help breeders identify candidate genes (both up- and down-regulated) associated with drought tolerance and suitable targets for manipulating the drought-tolerance trait in rice.
26626493	Assessing the genetic diversity of rice originating from Bangladesh, Assam and West Bengal.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity among rice cultivars from Bangladesh and North East India was assessed using a custom 384-SNP microarray assay. A total of 511 cultivars were obtained from several sources, choosing landraces likely to be from the aus subpopulation and modern improved cultivars from Bangladesh. Cultivars from the OryzaSNP set and Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) were also included for reference.

RESULTS: The population analysis program STRUCTURE was used to infer putative population groups in the panel, revealing four groups: indica (76 cultivars), japonica (55) and two distinct groups within the aus subpopulation (aus-1 = 99, aus-2 = 151). Principal Component Analysis was used to confirm the four population groups identified by STRUCTURE. The analysis revealed cultivars that belonged to neither aus-1 nor aus-2 but which are clearly aus based on the combined probabilities of their membership of the two aus groups which have been termed aus-admix (96). Information obtained from the panel of 511 cultivars was used to assign rice groups to 74 additional landraces obtained from Assam and West Bengal. While both the aus-1 and aus-2 groups were represented approximately equally in India, aus-2 (which includes cultivar N 22) was more common in Bangladesh, but was not found at all in West Bengal.

CONCLUSIONS: Examining the distribution of landrace names within theaus-1 and aus-2 groups suggests that aus-1 is associated with the term "boro", a word used to describe a winter growing season in Bangladesh and Assam. The information described here has been used to select a population of 300 cultivars for Genome Wide Association studies of the aus rice subpopulation.
26648960	Zinc-Dependent Protection of Tobacco and Rice Cells From Aluminum-Induced Superoxide-Mediated Cytotoxicity.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Al(3+) toxicity in growing plants is considered as one of the major factors limiting the production of crops on acidic soils worldwide. In the last 15 years, it has been proposed that Al(3+) toxicity are mediated with distortion of the cellular signaling mechanisms such as calcium signaling pathways, and production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing oxidative damages. On the other hand, zinc is normally present in plants at high concentrations and its deficiency is one of the most widespread micronutrient deficiencies in plants. Earlier studies suggested that lack of zinc often results in ROS-mediated oxidative damage to plant cells. Previously, inhibitory action of Zn(2+) against lanthanide-induced superoxide generation in tobacco cells have been reported, suggesting that Zn(2+) interferes with the cation-induced ROS production via stimulation of NADPH oxidase. In the present study, the effect of Zn(2+) on Al(3+)-induced superoxide generation in the cell suspension cultures of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., cell-line, BY-2) and rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Nipponbare), was examined. The Zn(2+)-dependent inhibition of the Al(3+)-induced oxidative burst was observed in both model cells selected from the monocots and dicots (rice and tobacco), suggesting that this phenomenon (Al(3+)/Zn(2+) interaction) can be preserved in higher plants. Subsequently induced cell death in tobacco cells was analyzed by lethal cell staining with Evans blue. Obtained results indicated that presence of Zn(2+) at physiological concentrations can protect the cells by preventing the Al(3+)-induced superoxide generation and cell death. Furthermore, the regulation of the Ca(2+) signaling, i.e., change in the cytosolic Ca(2+) ion concentration, and the cross-talks among the elements which participate in the pathway were further explored.
26710230	Identification and Characterization of Differentially Expressed Genes in Inferior and Superior Spikelets of Rice Cultivars with Contrasting Panicle-Compactness and Grain-Filling Properties.	2015	PLoS One	Breeding programs for increasing spikelet number in rice have resulted in compactness of the panicle, accompanied by poor grain filling in inferior spikelets. Although the inefficient utilization of assimilate has been indicated as responsible for this poor grain filling, the underlying cause remains elusive. The current study utilized the suppression subtractive hybridization technique to identify 57 and 79 genes that overexpressed in the superior and inferior spikelets (with respect to each other), respectively, of the compact-panicle rice cultivar Mahalaxmi. Functional categorization of these differentially expressed genes revealed a marked metabolic difference between the spikelets according to their spatial location on the panicle. The expression of genes encoding seed storage proteins was dominant in inferior spikelets, whereas genes encoding regulatory proteins, such as serine-threonine kinase, zinc finger protein and E3 ligase, were highly expressed in superior spikelets. The expression patterns of these genes in the inferior and superior spikelets of Mahalaxmi were similar to those observed in another compact-panicle cultivar, OR-1918, but differed from those obtained in two lax-panicle cultivars, Upahar and Lalat. The results first suggest that the regulatory proteins abundantly expressed in the superior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars and in both the superior and inferior spikelets of lax-panicle cultivars but poorly expressed in the inferior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars promote grain filling. Second, the high expression of seed-storage proteins observed in the inferior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars appears to inhibit the grain filling process. Third, the low expression of enzymes of the Krebs cycle in inferior spikelets compared with superior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars is bound to lead to poor ATP generation in the former and consequently limit starch biosynthesis, an ATP-consuming process, resulting in poor grain filling.
26659593	OsERF2 controls rice root growth and hormone responses through tuning expression of key genes involved in hormone signaling and sucrose metabolism.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Root determines plant distribution, development progresses, stress response, as well as crop qualities and yields, which is under the tight control of genetic programs and environmental stimuli. Ethylene responsive factor proteins (ERFs) play important roles in plant growth and development. Here, the regulatory function of OsERF2 involved in root growth was investigated using the gain-function mutant of OsERF2 (nsf2857) and the artificial microRNA-mediated silenced lines of OsERF2 (Ami-OsERF2). nsf2857 showed short primary roots compared with the wild type (WT), while the primary roots of Ami-OsERF2 lines were longer than those of WT. Consistent with this phenotype, several auxin/cytokinin responsive genes involved in root growth were downregulated in nsf2857, but upregulated in Ami-OsERF2. Then, we found that nsf2857 seedlings exhibited decreased ABA accumulation and sensitivity to ABA and reduced ethylene-mediated root inhibition, while those were the opposite in Ami-ERF2 plants. Moreover, several key genes involved in ABA synthesis were downregulated in nsf2857, but unregulated in Ami-ERF2 lines. In addition, OsERF2 affected the accumulation of sucrose and UDPG by mediating expression of key genes involved in sucrose metabolism. These results indicate that OsERF2 is required for the control of root architecture and ABA- and ethylene-response by tuning expression of series genes involved in sugar metabolism and hormone signaling pathways.
26700579	Electrochemical biosensor for microRNA detection based on poly(U) polymerase mediated isothermal signal amplification.	2016	Biosens Bioelectron	MicroRNAs play crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation for gene expression in animals, plants, and viruses. For the better understanding of microRNA and its functions, it is very important to develop effectively analytical method for microRNA detection. Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor was fabricated for sensitive and selective detection of microRNA based on poly(U) polymerase mediated isothermal signal amplification, where poly(U) polymerase can catalyze the template independent addition of UMP from UTP to the 3' end of RNA. Using this activity, the target microRNA can be successfully labeled with biotin conjugated UMPs at its 3'-end using biotin conjugated UTP (biotin-UTP) as donor. Then, the avidin conjugated alkaline phosphatase can be further captured to the 3'-end of the target microRNA based on the specific interaction between biotin and avidin. Finally, under the catalytic activity of alkaline phosphatase, the substrate of p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate can be hydrolyzed to produce 4-nitrophenol. According to the relationship between the electrochemical signal of p-nitrophenol and the concentration of microRNA-319a, the content of microRNA-319a can be detected. This signal amplification method is simple and sensitive. The developed method can detect as low as 1.7 fM microRNA and produce precise and accurate linear dynamic range from 10 to 1000 fM. The fabricated biosensor was further applied to detect the expression level change of microRNA-319a in rice seedlings after incubation with five kinds of different phytohormones.
26719745	Genetic basis of multiple resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) and the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler) in the rice cultivar 'ASD7' (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2015	Breed Sci	The rice cultivar ASD7 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) is resistant to the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål) and the green leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens Distant). Here, we analyzed multiple genetic resistance to BPH and the green rice leafhopper (GRH; Nephotettix cincticeps Uhler). Using two independent F2 populations derived from a cross between ASD7 and Taichung 65 (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica), we detected two QTLs (qBPH6 and qBPH12) for resistance to BPH and one QTL (qGRH5) for resistance to GRH. Linkage analysis in BC2F3 populations revealed that qBPH12 controlled resistance to BPH and co-segregated with SSR markers RM28466 and RM7376 in plants homozygous for the ASD7 allele at qBPH6. Plants homozygous for the ASD7 alleles at both QTLs showed a much faster antibiosis response to BPH than plants homozygous at only one of these QTLs. It revealed that epistatic interaction between qBPH6 and qBPH12 is the basis of resistance to BPH in ASD7. In addition, qGRH5 controlled resistance to GRH and co-segregated with SSR markers RM6082 and RM3381. qGRH5 is identical to GRH1. Thus, we clarified the genetic basis of multiple resistance of ASD7 to BPH and GRH.
26714456	Novel and conserved miRNAs in the halophyte Suaeda maritima identified by deep sequencing and computational predictions using the ESTs of two mangrove plants.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Although miRNAs are reportedly involved in the salt stress tolerance of plants, miRNA profiling in plants has largely remained restricted to glycophytes, including certain crop species that do not exhibit any tolerance to salinity. Hence, this manuscript describes the results from the miRNA profiling of the halophyte Suaeda maritima, which is used worldwide to study salt tolerance in plants.

RESULTS: A total of 134 conserved miRNAs were identified from unique sRNA reads, with 126 identified using miRBase 21.0 and an additional eight identified using the Plant Non-coding RNA Database. The presence of the precursors of seven conserved miRNAs was validated in S. maritima. In addition, 13 novel miRNAs were predicted using the ESTs of two mangrove plants, Rhizophora mangle and Heritiera littoralis, and the precursors of seven miRNAs were found in S. maritima. Most of the miRNAs considered for characterization were responsive to NaCl application, indicating their importance in the regulation of metabolic activities in plants exposed to salinity. An expression study of the novel miRNAs in plants of diverse ecological and taxonomic groups revealed that two of the miRNAs, sma-miR6 and sma-miR7, were also expressed in Oryza sativa, whereas another two, sma-miR2 and sma-miR5, were only expressed in plants growing under the influence of seawater, similar to S. maritima.

CONCLUSION: The distribution of conserved miRNAs among only 25 families indicated the possibility of identifying a greater number of miRNAs with increase in knowledge of the genomes of more halophytes. The expression of two novel miRNAs, sma-miR2 and sma-miR5, only in plants growing under the influence of seawater suggested their metabolic regulatory roles specific to saline environments, and such behavior might be mediated by alterations in the expression of certain genes, modifications of proteins leading to changes in their activity and production of secondary metabolites as revealed by the miRNA target predictions. Moreover, the auxin responsive factor targeted by sma-miR7 could also be involved in salt tolerance because the target is conserved between species. This study also indicated that the transcriptome of one species can be successfully used to computationally predict the miRNAs in other species, especially those that have similar metabolism, even if they are taxonomically separated.
26650613	The linear plastid chromosomes of maize: terminal sequences, structures, and implications for DNA replication.	2016	Curr Genet	The structure of a chromosomal DNA molecule may influence the way in which it is replicated and inherited. For decades plastid DNA (ptDNA) was believed to be circular, with breakage invoked to explain linear forms found upon extraction from the cell. Recent evidence indicates that ptDNA in vivo consists of linear molecules with discrete termini, although these ends were not characterized. We report the sequences of two terminal regions, End1 and End2, for maize (Zea mays L.) ptDNA. We describe structural features of these terminal regions and similarities found in other plant ptDNAs. The terminal sequences are within inverted repeat regions (leading to four genomic isomers) and adjacent to origins of replication. Conceptually, stem-loop structures may be formed following melting of the double-stranded DNA ends. Exonuclease digestion indicates that the ends in maize are unobstructed, but tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) ends may have a 5'-protein. If the terminal structure of ptDNA molecules influences the retention of ptDNA, the unprotected molecular ends in mature leaves of maize may be more susceptible to degradation in vivo than the protected ends in tobacco. The terminal sequences and cumulative GC skew profiles are nearly identical for maize, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.), with less similarity among other plants. The linear structure is now confirmed for maize ptDNA and inferred for other plants and suggests a virus-like recombination-dependent replication mechanism for ptDNA. Plastid transformation vectors containing the terminal sequences may increase the chances of success in generating transplastomic cereals.
26641666	TALEN-Based Mutagenesis of Lipoxygenase LOX3 Enhances the Storage Tolerance of Rice (Oryza sativa) Seeds.	2015	PLoS One	The deterioration of rice grain reduces the quality of rice, resulting in serious economic losses for farmers. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids with at least one cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene to form hydroperoxide, which is a major factor influencing seed longevity and viability. Recently, genome editing, an essential tool employed in reverse genetics, has been used experimentally to investigate basic plant biology or to modify crop plants for the improvement of important agricultural traits. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis in rice using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to improve seed storability. A modified ligation-independent cloning method (LIC) was employed to allow for the quick and efficient directional insertion of TALEN monomer modules into destination vectors used in plants. We demonstrated the feasibility and flexibility of the technology by developing a set of modular vectors for genome editing. After construction and validation, the TALEN pairs were used to create stable transgenic rice lines via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. One heterozygous mutant (4%) was recovered from 25 transgenic NPTII-resistant lines, and the mutation was transmitted to the next generation. Further molecular and protein level experiments verified LOX3 deficiency and demonstrated the improvement of seed storability. Our work provides a flexible genome editing tool for improving important agronomic traits, as well as direct evidence that Lox3 has only a limited impact on seed longevity.
26655679	Novel green tissue-specific synthetic promoters and cis-regulatory elements in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	As an important part of synthetic biology, synthetic promoter has gradually become a hotspot in current biology. The purposes of the present study were to synthesize green tissue-specific promoters and to discover green tissue-specific cis-elements. We first assembled several regulatory sequences related to tissue-specific expression in different combinations, aiming to obtain novel green tissue-specific synthetic promoters. GUS assays of the transgenic plants indicated 5 synthetic promoters showed green tissue-specific expression patterns and different expression efficiencies in various tissues. Subsequently, we scanned and counted the cis-elements in different tissue-specific promoters based on the plant cis-elements database PLACE and the rice cDNA microarray database CREP for green tissue-specific cis-element discovery, resulting in 10 potential cis-elements. The flanking sequence of one potential core element (GEAT) was predicted by bioinformatics. Then, the combination of GEAT and its flanking sequence was functionally identified with synthetic promoter. GUS assays of the transgenic plants proved its green tissue-specificity. Furthermore, the function of GEAT flanking sequence was analyzed in detail with site-directed mutagenesis. Our study provides an example for the synthesis of rice tissue-specific promoters and develops a feasible method for screening and functional identification of tissue-specific cis-elements with their flanking sequences at the genome-wide level in rice.
26717118	Whole-cell biocatalytic and de novo production of alkanes from free fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2017	Biotechnol Bioeng	Rapid global industrialization in the past decades has led to extensive utilization of fossil fuels, which resulted in pressing environmental problems due to excessive carbon emission. This prompted increasing interest in developing advanced biofuels with higher energy density to substitute fossil fuels and bio-alkane has gained attention as an ideal drop-in fuel candidate. Production of alkanes in bacteria has been widely studied but studies on the utilization of the robust yeast host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for alkane biosynthesis have been lacking. In this proof-of-principle study, we present the unprecedented engineering of S. cerevisiae for conversion of free fatty acids to alkanes. A fatty acid α-dioxygenase from Oryza sativa (rice) was expressed in S. cerevisiae to transform C12-18 free fatty acids to C11-17 aldehydes. Co-expression of a cyanobacterial aldehyde deformylating oxygenase converted the aldehydes to the desired alkanes. We demonstrated the versatility of the pathway by performing whole-cell biocatalytic conversion of exogenous free fatty acid feedstocks into alkanes as well as introducing the pathway into a free fatty acid overproducer for de novo production of alkanes from simple sugar. The results from this work are anticipated to advance the development of yeast hosts for alkane production. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 232-237. © 2016 The Authors.

26054240	Genetic analysis of flag leaf size and candidate genes determination of a major QTL for flag leaf width in rice.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Flag leaf is the most essential organ for photosynthesis in rice and its size plays an important role in rice breeding for ideal plant-type. Flag leaf size affect photosynthesis to a certain extent, thereby influencing rice production. Several genes controlling leaf size and shape have been identified with mutants. Although a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for leaf size and shape have been detected on 12 chromosomes with different populations of rice, few of them were cloned.

RESULTS: The pair-wise correlation analysis was conducted on length, width and length-width ratio of the flag leaf, and yield per plant in the core recombinant inbred lines of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu (LYP9) developed in Hainan and Hangzhou. There were significant correlations among the three flag leaf size and shape traits. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between flag leaf width and yield per plant. Based on the high-resolution linkage map we constructed before, 43 QTLs were detected for three flag leaf size and shape traits and yield per plant, among which 31 QTLs were unreported so far. Seven QTLs were identified common in two environments. And qFLW7.2, a new major QTL for flag leaf width, was fine mapped within 27.1 kb region on chromosome 7. Both qFLW7.2 and qPY7 were located in the interval of 45.30 ~ 53.34 cM on chromosome 7, which coincided with the relationship between yield per plant (PY) and flag leaf width (FLW).

CONCLUSION: qFLW7.2, which explained 14% of the phenotypic variation, increased flag leaf width with 93-11 allele. Two candidate genes were selected based on sequence variation and expression difference between two parents, which facilitated further QTL cloning and molecular breeding in super rice.
26646110	JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection via reducing H3K4me2/3 associated with negative disease resistance regulators.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are a group of functionally conserved histone lysine demethylases in Eukaryotes. Growing evidences have shown that JmjCs epigenetically regulate various biological processes in plants. However, their roles in plant biotic stress, especially in rice bacterial blight resistance have been barely studied so far.

RESULTS: In this study, we found that the global di- and tri-methylation levels on multiple lysine sites of histone three were dramatically altered after being infected by bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Xoo infection induced the transcription of 15 JmjCs, suggesting these JmjCs are involved in rice bacterial blight defense. Further functional characterization of JmjC mutants revealed that JMJ704 is a positive regulator of rice bacterial blight resistance as the jmj704 became more susceptible to Xoo than the wild-type. In jmj704, the H3K4me2/3 levels were significantly increased; suggesting JMJ704 may be involved in H3K4me2/3 demethylation. Moreover, JMJ704 suppressed the transcription of the rice defense negative regulator genes, such as NRR, OsWRKY62 and Os-11N3, by reducing the activation marks H3K4me2/3 on them.

CONCLUSIONS: JMJ704 may be a universal switch controlling multiple genes of the bacterial blight resistance pathway. JMJ704 positively regulates rice defense by epigenetically suppressing master negative defense regulators, presenting a novel mechanism distinct from its homolog JMJ705 which also positively regulates rice defense but via activating positive defense regulators.
26714735	The wheat MYB-related transcription factor TaMYB72 promotes flowering in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Through large-scale transformation analyses, TaMYB72 was identified as a flowering time regulator in wheat. TaMYB72 is a MYB family transcription factor localized to the nucleus. Three TaMYB72 homologs, TaMYB72-A, TaMYB72-B and TaMYB72-D, cloned from hexaploid wheat were mapped to the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. Under the long-day conditions, over-expression of the TaMYB72 in rice shortened the flowering time by approximately 12 d. Expression analyses suggest that TaMYB72 may function through up-regulation of florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1.
26631017	A comparison of aquaporin function in mediating stomatal aperture gating among drought-tolerant and sensitive varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Protoplasma	Climate change drastically affects the cultivation of rice, and its production is affected significantly by water stress. Adaptation of a plant to water deficit conditions is orchestrated by efficient water uptake and a stringently regulated water loss. Transpiration remains the major means of water loss from plants and is mediated by microscopic pores called stomata. Stomatal aperture gating is facilitated by ion channels and aquaporins (AQPs) which regulate the turgidity of the guard cells. In a similar manner, efficient water uptake by the roots is regulated by the presence of AQPs in the plasma membrane of root cells. In this study, we compare the efficiency of transmembrane water permeability in guard cells and root protoplasts from drought-tolerant and sensitive varieties of Oryza sativa L. In this report, we studied the transmembrane osmotic water permeability (Pos) of guard cell and root protoplasts of drought-sensitive and tolerant cultivars. The guard cells isolated from the drought-sensitive lowland rice variety ADT-39 show significant low osmotic permeability than the drought-tolerant rice varieties of Anna (lowland) and Dodda Byra Nellu (DBN) (upland local land rice). There is no significant difference in relative gene expression patterns of PIPs (Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins "PIP1" and "PIP2" subfamilies) in guard cells isolated from ADT-39 and Anna. While the expression levels of AQP genes remain the same between ADT-39 and Anna, there is a drastic difference in their osmotic permeability in the guard cells in spite of a higher number of stomata in Anna and DBN, hinting at a more efficient gating mechanism of AQP in the stomata of the drought-tolerant varieties studied.
26697896	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	2016	Plant Physiol	After meiosis, tapetal cells in the innermost anther wall layer undergo program cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation. This step is essential for microspore development and pollen wall maturation. We identified a key gene, Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1), that controls this degeneration by modulating the dynamics of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during rice male reproduction. Mutants defective in DTC1 exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility. The gene is preferentially expressed in the tapetal cells during early anther development. In dtc1 anthers, expression of genes encoding secretory proteases or lipid transporters is significantly reduced, while transcripts of PCD regulatory genes, e.g. UDT1, TDR1, and EAT1/DTD, are not altered. Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers. These results suggest that DTC1 functions downstream of those transcription factor genes and upstream of the genes encoding secretory proteins. DTC1 protein interacts with OsMT2b, a ROS scavenger. Whereas wild-type plants accumulate large amounts of ROS in their anthers at Stage 9 of development, those levels remain low during all stages of development in dtc1 anthers. These findings indicate that DTC1 is a key regulator for tapetum PCD by inhibiting ROS-scavenging activity.
26644084	Knockdown of the partner protein OsNAR2.1 for high-affinity nitrate transport represses lateral root formation in a nitrate-dependent manner.	2015	Sci Rep	The morphological plasticity of root systems is critical for plant survival, and understanding the mechanisms underlying root adaptation to nitrogen (N) fluctuation is critical for sustainable agriculture; however, the molecular mechanism of N-dependent root growth in rice remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the role of the complementary high-affinity NO3(-) transport protein OsNAR2.1 in NO3(-)-regulated rice root growth. Comparisons with wild-type (WT) plants showed that knockdown of OsNAR2.1 inhibited lateral root (LR) formation under low NO3(-) concentrations, but not under low NH4(+) concentrations. (15)N-labelling NO3(-) supplies (provided at concentrations of 0-10 mM) demonstrated that (i) defects in LR formation in mutants subjected to low external NO3(-) concentrations resulted from impaired NO3(-) uptake, and (ii) the mutants had significantly fewer LRs than the WT plants when root N contents were similar between genotypes. LR formation in osnar2.1 mutants was less sensitive to localised NO3(-) supply than LR formation in WT plants, suggesting that OsNAR2.1 may be involved in a NO3(-)-signalling pathway that controls LR formation. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 inhibited LR formation by decreasing auxin transport from shoots to roots. Thus, OsNAR2.1 probably functions in both NO3(-) uptake and NO3(-)-signalling.
26719744	Genetic dissection of seed storability using two different populations with a same parent rice cultivar N22.	2015	Breed Sci	Seed storability in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important agronomic trait. Two segregating populations with N22 (indica) as a common parent, viz. a set of 122 backcross-inbred lines (BILs) derived from the backcross Nanjing35 (japonica)/N22//Nanjing35 and another population comprising 189 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross of USSR5 (japonica) and N22, were studied to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling seed storability. Germination percentage (GP) was used to evaluate seed storability after aging treated under three different conditions, viz. natural, artificial and combined aging treatments. A total of seven QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6 and 9. Among them, a major QTL, qSSn-9, was common in the two populations. In contrast, four QTLs (qSSnj-2-1, qSSn-2-2, qSSn-5 and qSSn-6) were detected in BILs and the QTL qSSn-1 was identified in RILs, which was a new QTL for seed storability. The N22-derived alleles increased the seed storability at all the loci except qSSnj-2-1. We also investigated the effect of QTLs using five selected lines with high storability from BILs and verified qSSn-5 with a near-isogenic line (NIL). These results provide an opportunity for pyramiding or map-based cloning major QTLs for seed storability in rice.
26679839	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound MoSec62 is involved in the suppression of rice immunity and is essential for the pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) constitutes the first line of plant inducible immunity. As an important step of plant colonization, phytopathogens have to suppress PTI, and secreted effectors are therefore co-evolved and deployed. In this study, we characterized the function of MoSec62 of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of the destructive rice blast. MoSec62 encodes a homologue of Sec62p, a yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane transporter for precursors of secretory proteins. We showed that a T-DNA insertion into the promoter region of MoSec62, causing a disturbance to the up-regulation of MoSec62 expression during blast invasion, resulted in a complete loss of blast virulence of the mutant, M1575. Both 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining of the infected rice leaves and expression analysis revealed that the infectious attempt by the mutant led to strong defence responses of rice. Consistently, in transcriptomic analysis of rice leaves subject to blast inoculation, a battery of defence responses was found to be induced exclusively on M1575 challenge. For further exploration, we tested the pathogenicity on a highly susceptible rice variety and detected the accumulation of Slp1, a known PTI suppressor. Both results suggested that the mutant most likely failed to overcome rice PTI. In addition, we showed that MoSec62 was able to rescue the thermosensitivity of a yeast Δsec62, and the MoSec62-GFP fusion was co-localized to the ER membrane, both suggesting the conservation of Sec62 homologues. In conclusion, our data indicate that MoSec62, probably as an ER membrane transporter, plays an essential role in antagonizing rice defence at the early stages of blast invasion.
26646386	Proteomic Analysis of Isogenic Rice Reveals Proteins Correlated with Aroma Compound Biosynthesis at Different Developmental Stages.	2016	Mol Biotechnol	Fragrant rice has a potent flavor compound, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). A better understanding of the 2AP biosynthetic pathway is gained by proteomic analysis of two isogenic lines of Thai jasmine rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Khao Dawk Mali 105, which differ only in the aromatic gene Os2AP. The protein profiles of two lines, from six growth stages, seedling to grain filling, had 41 identifiable protein spots. Four of these spots were betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, a key enzyme responsible for 2AP production. This enzyme occurred in every growth stage of the non-aromatic rice line except smaller amount detected in the hard grain-filling stage of the aromatic line. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase, observed in the aromatic line, may involve in the metabolism of precursors for 2AP biosynthesis. In addition, glutamine synthetase and 1-cys peroxiredoxin A which function in ammonia reassimilation and hydrogen peroxide detoxification were unique in the aromatic line. However, proteins that correspond to photosynthesis and the nutrient reservoir were only detected in lower abundances. This possibly explains why the aroma rice grain weight is low. Our study proposed the possible role of these remarkable proteins which involved in 2AP biosynthesis in jasmine rice.
26667653	Physiological and Molecular Alterations Promoted by Schizotetranychus oryzae Mite Infestation in Rice Leaves.	2016	J Proteome Res	Infestation of phytophagous mite Schizotetranychus oryzae in rice causes critical yield losses. To better understand this interaction, we employed Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) approach to identify differentially expressed proteins. We detected 18 and 872 unique proteins in control and infested leaves, respectively, along with 32 proteins more abundant in control leaves. S. oryzae infestation caused decreased abundance of proteins related to photosynthesis (mostly photosystem II-related), carbon assimilation and energy production, chloroplast detoxification, defense, and fatty acid and gibberellin synthesis. On the contrary, infestation caused increased abundance of proteins involved in protein modification and degradation, gene expression at the translation level, protein partitioning to different organelles, lipid metabolism, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and synthesis of jasmonate, amino acid, and molecular chaperones. Our results also suggest that S. oryzae infestation promotes cell-wall remodeling and interferes with ethylene biosynthesis in rice leaves. Proteomic data were positively correlated with enzymatic assays and RT-qPCR analysis. Our findings describe the protein expression patterns of infested rice leaves and suggest that the acceptor side of PSII is probably the major damaged target in the photosynthetic apparatus. These data will be useful in future biotechnological approaches aiming to induce phytophagous mite resistance in rice.
26657562	A single-nucleotide exon found in Arabidopsis.	2015	Sci Rep	The presence of introns in gene-coding regions is one of the most mysterious evolutionary inventions in eukaryotic organisms. It has been proposed that, although sequences involved in intron recognition and splicing are mainly located in introns, exonic sequences also contribute to intron splicing. The smallest constitutively spliced exon known so far has 6 nucleotides, and the smallest alternatively spliced exon has 3 nucleotides. Here we report that the Anaphase Promoting Complex subunit 11 (APC11) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana carries a constitutive single-nucleotide exon. In vivo transcription and translation assays performed using APC11-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) fusion constructs revealed that intron splicing surrounding the single-nucleotide exon is effective in both Arabidopsis and rice. This discovery warrants attention to genome annotations in the future.
26704419	Stacking S5-n and f5-n to overcome sterility in indica-japonica hybrid rice.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Pyramiding of S5 - n and f5 - n cumulatively improved seed-setting rate of indica-japonica hybrids, which provided an effective approach for utilization of inter-subspecific heterosis in rice breeding. Breeding for indica-japonica hybrid rice is an attractive approach to increase rice yield. However, hybrid sterility is a major obstacle in utilization of inter-subspecific heterosis. Wide-compatibility alleles can break the fertility barrier between indica and japonica subspecies, which have the potential to overcome inter-subspecific hybrid sterility. Here, we improved the compatibility of an elite indica restorer line 9311 to a broad spectrum of japonica varieties, by introducing two wide-compatibility alleles, S5-n and f5-n, regulating embryo-sac and pollen fertility, respectively. Through integrated backcross breeding, two near isogenic lines harboring either S5-n or f5-n and a pyramiding line carrying S5-n plus f5-n were obtained, with the recurrent parent genome recovery of 99.95, 99.49, and 99.44 %, respectively. The three lines showed normal fertility when crossed to typical indica testers. When testcrossed to five typical japonica varieties, these lines allowed significant increase of compatibility with constant agronomic performance. The introgressed S5-n could significantly improve 14.7-32.9 % embryo-sac fertility in indica-japonica hybrids. In addition, with the presence of f5-n fragment, S5-n would increase the spikelet fertility from 9.5 to 21.8 %. The introgressed f5-n fragment greatly improved anther dehiscence, embryo-sac and pollen fertility in indica-japonica hybrids, thus leading to improvement of spikelet fertility from 20.4 to 30.9 %. Moreover, the pyramiding line showed 33.6-46.7 % increase of spikelet fertility, suggesting cumulative effect of S5-n and f5-n fragment in seed-set improvement of inter-subspecific hybrids. Our results provided an effective approach for exploiting heterosis between indica and japonica subspecies, which had a profound implication in rice breeding.
26681058	Genetic diversity in mutated and non-mutated rice varieties.	2015	Genet Mol Res	We studied the genetic variability due to mutation induced by γ-rays (10, 15, and 20 Kr) on various traits of twelve rice genotypes. Mutated and non-mutated seeds were sown in the field between July 2013 and 2014 using a split plot design. Yield and yield-related trait data was recorded, which showed significant (P < 0.05) genotypic and irradiation effects. Gamma radiation exerted non-significant effects on the panicle length of all plants, indicating the uniformity of performance of this character at different radiation levels. The plant height, grains per main panicle, panicle length, 1000-grain weight, grain weight per main panicle, and fertility percentage was minimum in Basmati-198, Basmati-Pak, Shaheen-2000, Super Basmati, Basmati-385, and Super Basmati, respectively, when exposed to radiation at 20 Kr. However, Basmati-370 attained maximum flag leaf area at this level of radiation. Broad sense heritability ranged from 72.0 to 97.7%, indicating the possibility of selection during earlier generations. Phenotypic correlation was positive and significant between grain weight per main panicle with panicle length and flag leaf area. Number of grains per main panicle and genotypic correlation were positive among grain weight per main panicle, panicle length, fertility percentage, 1000-grain weight, and plant height, indicating the effectiveness of these traits in the selection for yield. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a pair-wise similarity ranging from 0.51-0.76 before mutation and 0.39-0.89 after mutation. This study proved that γ-rays at 20 Kr would be most effective in creating genetic variability in the existing germplasm.
26467468	OsGF14b Positively Regulates Panicle Blast Resistance but Negatively Regulates Leaf Blast Resistance in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Although 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to be involved in responses to biotic stresses in plants, their functions in rice blast, the most destructive disease in rice, are largely unknown. Only GF14e has been confirmed to negatively regulate leaf blast. We report that GF14b is highly expressed in seedlings and panicles during blast infection. Rice plants overexpressing GF14b show enhanced resistance to panicle blast but are susceptible to leaf blast. In contrast, GF14b-silenced plants show increased susceptibility to panicle blast but enhanced resistance to leaf blast. Yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that WRKY71 binds to the promoter of GF14b and modulates its expression. Overexpression of GF14b induces expression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes but suppresses expression of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes. In contrast, suppressed GF14b expression causes decreased expression of JA synthesis-related genes but activation of SA synthesis-related genes. These results suggest that GF14b positively regulates panicle blast resistance but negatively regulates leaf blast resistance, and that GF14b-mediated disease resistance is associated with the JA- and SA-dependent pathway. The different functions for 14-3-3 proteins in leaf and panicle blast provide new evidence that leaf and panicle blast resistance are controlled by different mechanisms.
26640944	Transcriptomic Analysis and the Expression of Disease-Resistant Genes in Oryza meyeriana under Native Condition.	2015	PLoS One	Oryza meyeriana (O. meyeriana), with a GG genome type (2n = 24), accumulated plentiful excellent characteristics with respect to resistance to many diseases such as rice shade and blast, even immunity to bacterial blight. It is very important to know if the diseases-resistant genes exist and express in this wild rice under native conditions. However, limited genomic or transcriptomic data of O. meyeriana are currently available. In this study, we present the first comprehensive characterization of the O. meyeriana transcriptome using RNA-seq and obtained 185,323 contigs with an average length of 1,692 bp and an N50 of 2,391 bp. Through differential expression analysis, it was found that there were most tissue-specifically expressed genes in roots, and next to stems and leaves. By similarity search against protein databases, 146,450 had at least a significant alignment to existed gene models. Comparison with the Oryza sativa (japonica-type Nipponbare and indica-type 93-11) genomes revealed that 13% of the O. meyeriana contigs had not been detected in O. sativa. Many diseases-resistant genes, such as bacterial blight resistant, blast resistant, rust resistant, fusarium resistant, cyst nematode resistant and downy mildew gene, were mined from the transcriptomic database. There are two kinds of rice bacterial blight-resistant genes (Xa1 and Xa26) differentially or specifically expressed in O. meyeriana. The 4 Xa1 contigs were all only expressed in root, while three of Xa26 contigs have the highest expression level in leaves, two of Xa26 contigs have the highest expression profile in stems and one of Xa26 contigs was expressed dominantly in roots. The transcriptomic database of O. meyeriana has been constructed and many diseases-resistant genes were found to express under native condition, which provides a foundation for future discovery of a number of novel genes and provides a basis for studying the molecular mechanisms associated with disease resistance in O. meyeriana.
26690414	De Novo Transcriptome Sequencing of Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt to Identify Disease-Resistance Genes.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt is one of the most important wild relatives of cultivated rice and exhibits high resistance to many diseases. It has been used as a source of genes for introgression into cultivated rice. However, there are limited genomic resources and little genetic information publicly reported for this species. To better understand the pathways and factors involved in disease resistance and accelerating the process of rice breeding, we carried out a de novo transcriptome sequencing of O. officinalis. In this research, 137,229 contigs were obtained ranging from 200 to 19,214 bp with an N50 of 2331 bp through de novo assembly of leaves, stems and roots in O. officinalis using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Based on sequence similarity searches against a non-redundant protein database, a total of 88,249 contigs were annotated with gene descriptions and 75,589 transcripts were further assigned to GO terms. Candidate genes for plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormones regulation pathways involved in disease-resistance were identified. Further analyses of gene expression profiles showed that the majority of genes related to disease resistance were all expressed in the three tissues. In addition, there are two kinds of rice bacterial blight-resistant genes in O. officinalis, including two Xa1 genes and three Xa26 genes. All 2 Xa1 genes showed the highest expression level in stem, whereas one of Xa26 was expressed dominantly in leaf and other 2 Xa26 genes displayed low expression level in all three tissues. This transcriptomic database provides an opportunity for identifying the genes involved in disease-resistance and will provide a basis for studying functional genomics of O. officinalis and genetic improvement of cultivated rice in the future.
26686058	Uptake, translocation and transformation of antimony in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2016	Environ Pollut	Antimony (Sb), as a toxic metalloid, has been gaining increasing research concerns due mainly to its severe pollution in many places. Rice has been identified to be the dominant intake route of Sb by residents close to the Sb mining areas. A hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the difference in uptake, translocation and transformation of Sb in rice seedlings of four cultivars exposed to 0.2 or 1.0 mg/L of Sb(V). The results showed that mass concentration of iron plaque (mg/kg FW) formed at the root surfaces of cultivar N was the highest among all tested cultivars at both low and high exposure levels of Sb(V). The accumulated Sb concentration in iron plaque significantly increased with an increase in mass concentration of iron plaque formed at the rice root. The total amount of iron plaque (mg/pot) at rice root generally increased with increasing exposed Sb(V) concentration, which was closely associated with the increasing lipid peroxidation in roots. Concentration percentage of Sb in rice root significantly reduced as the corresponding value in the iron plaque increased, suggesting that iron plaque formation strongly suppressed uptake of Sb by rice root. Sb concentration in rice tissues followed an order: root > stem, leaf. The japonica rice (cultivars N and Z) exhibited a stronger translocation tendency of Sb from root to stem than indica hybrid rice (cultivars F and G). Translocation of Sb from root of cultivar F to its stem and leaf was sharply enhanced with increasing Sb exposure concentration. Sb(V) could be reduced to Sb(III) in rice tissues, especially in stems (10-26% of the total Sb). For the sake of food safety, the difference in uptake, translocation and transformation of Sb in rice species planted in Sb-contaminated soils should be taken into consideration.
26673149	Genetic variation and association mapping for 12 agronomic traits in indica rice.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Increasing rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield is a crucial challenge for modern agriculture. The ideal plant architecture is considered to be critical to enhance rice yield. Elite plant morphological traits should include compact plant type, short stature, few unproductive tillers, thick and sturdy stems and erect leaves. To reveal the genetic variations of important morphological traits, 523 germplasm accessions were genotyped using the Illumina custom-designed array containing 5,291 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped in two independent environments. Genome-wide association studies were performed to uncover the genotypic and phenotypic variations using a mixed linear model.

RESULTS: In total, 126 and 172 significant loci were identified and these loci explained an average of 34.45% and 39.09% of the phenotypic variance in two environments, respectively, and 16 of 298 (~5.37%) loci were detected across the two environments. For the 16 loci, 423 candidate genes were predicted in a 200-kb region (±100 kb of the peak SNP). Expression-level analyses identified four candidate genes as the most promising regulators of tiller angle. Known (NAL1 and Rc) and new significant loci showed pleiotropy and gene linkage. In addition, a long genome region covering ~1.6 Mb on chromosome 11 was identified, which may be critical for rice leaf architecture because of a high association with flag leaf length and the ratio of flag leaf length and width. The pyramid effect of the elite alleles indicated that these significant loci could be beneficial for rice plant architecture improvements in the future. Finally, 37 elite varieties were chosen as breeding donors for further rice plant architectural modifications.

CONCLUSIONS: This study detected multiple novel loci and candidate genes related to rice morphological traits, and the work demonstrated that genome-wide association studies are powerful strategies for uncovering the genetic variations of complex traits and identifying candidate genes in rice, even though the linkage disequilibrium decayed slowly in self-pollinating species. Future research will focus on the biological validation of the candidate genes, and elite varieties will also be of interest in genome selection and breeding by design.
26689479	Production of recombinant thanatin in watery rice seeds that lack an accumulation of storage starch and proteins.	2016	J Biotechnol	Molecular farming is a promising method for producing materials of commercial interest. Plants can be expected to be appropriate hosts for recombinant protein production. However, production in genetically modified plants has two major challenges that must be resolved before its practical use: insufficient accumulation of products and difficulty in establishing methods for their purification. We propose a simple procedure for the production of a desired protein using watery rice seeds lacking an accumulation of storage starch and proteins, a phenotype induced by the introduction of an antisense SPK. We produced a transgenic rice plant containing a gene for an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, together with antisense SPK. Bioassay and proteome analysis indicated that recombinant thanatin accumulated in an active form in these watery rice seeds. These results suggest that our system worked effectively for the production of thanatin. This procedure enabled easy removal of impurities and simplified the purification process compared with production in leaves. Our system may therefore be a useful technique for the production of desired materials, including proteins.
26709310	PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, impacts leaf senescence and indirectly affects grain yield and quality in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Chlorophyll (Chl) b is a ubiquitous accessory pigment in land plants, green algae, and prochlorophytes. This pigment is synthesized from Chl a by chlorophyllide a oxygenase and plays a key role in adaptation to various environments. This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach. PGL, encoding chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1, is mainly expressed in the chlorenchyma and activated in the light-dependent Chl synthesis process. Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality. In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type. Moreover, pgl is sensitive to heat stress.
26697348	RNA-Seq analysis of urea nutrition responsive transcriptome of Oryza sativa elite indica cultivar RP Bio 226.	2015	Genom Data	Rice yield is greatly influenced by the nitrogen and rice varieties show variation in yield. For understanding the role of urea nutrition in the yield of elite indica rice cultivar RPBio-226, the urea responsive transcriptome was sequenced and analyzed. The raw reads and the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession GDKM00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, GDKM01000000.
26719743	Genome-wide association mapping focusing on a rice population derived from rice breeding programs in a region.	2015	Breed Sci	Plant breeding programs in local regions may generate genetic variations that are desirable to local populations and shape adaptability during the establishment of local populations. To elucidate genetic bases for this process, we proposed a new approach for identifying the genetic bases for the traits improved during rice breeding programs; association mapping focusing on a local population. In the present study, we performed association mapping focusing on a local rice population, consisting of 63 varieties, in Hokkaido, the northernmost region of Japan and one of the northern limits of rice cultivation worldwide. Six and seventeen QTLs were identified for heading date and low temperature germinability, respectively. Of these, 13 were novel QTLs in this population and 10 corresponded to the QTLs previously reported based on QTL mapping. The identification of QTLs for traits in local populations including elite varieties may lead to a better understanding of the genetic bases of elite traits. This is of direct relevance for plant breeding programs in local regions.
26555942	Genome-Wide Identification of New Reference Genes for qRT-PCR Normalization under High Temperature Stress in Rice Endosperm.	2015	PLoS One	qRT-PCR is one of the most popular approaches to analyze specific gene expression level, and stably expressed reference genes are essential to obtain reliable results. However, many reference genes are only stable under certain circumstances and different reference genes might be required in different experiments. High temperature is a common stress that affects rice endosperm development and it has become a hot topic recently. Although study about reference genes at different developmental stages in rice has been reported, these genes may not be suitable to study high temperature mediated responses especially in endosperm. In our quest for proper reference genes to quantify gene expression in rice endosperm under high temperature, we studied 6 candidate genes selected from the transcriptome data and 11 housekeeping genes. All genes were analyzed with qRT-PCR and the expression stability was assessed with software geNorm and NormFinder. Fb15 and eIF-4a were identified as the two most stable genes in endosperm at different developmental stages, while high temperature treatment has a least effect on expression of Fb15 and UBQ5 in rice endosperm. Our results provide some good candidate reference genes for qRT-PCR normalization in rice endosperm under different temperatures.
26607788	Promoter-based identification of novel non-coding RNAs reveals the presence of dicistronic snoRNA-miRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: In the past few decades, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. Most studies of ncRNAs in plants have focused on the identification of silencing microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Another important family of ncRNAs that has been well characterized in plants is the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and the related small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). Both target chemical modifications of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). In plants, the snoRNA genes are organized in clusters, transcribed by RNA Pol II from a common promoter and subsequently processed into mature molecules. The promoter regions of snoRNA polycistronic genes in plants are highly enriched in two conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs), Telo-box and Site II, which coordinate the expression of snoRNAs and ribosomal protein coding genes throughout the cell cycle.

RESULTS: In order to identify novel ncRNA genes, we have used the snoRNA Telo-box/Site II motifs combination as a functional promoter indicator to screen the Arabidopsis genome. The predictions generated by this process were tested by detailed exploration of available RNA-Seq and expression data sets and experimental validation. As a result, we have identified several snoRNAs, scaRNAs and 'orphan' snoRNAs. We also show evidence for 16 novel ncRNAs that lack similarity to any reported RNA family. Finally, we have identified two dicistronic genes encoding precursors that are processed to mature snoRNA and miRNA molecules. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of this result in the context of a tight link between snoRNAs and miRNAs in eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS: We present an alternative computational approach for non-coding RNA detection. Instead of depending on sequence or structure similarity in the whole genome screenings, we have explored the properties of promoter regions of well-characterized ncRNAs. Interestingly, besides expected ncRNAs predictions we were also able to recover single precursor arrangement for snoRNA-miRNA. Accompanied by analyses performed on rice sequences, we conclude that such arrangement might have interesting functional and evolutionary consequences and discuss this result in the context of a tight link between snoRNAs and miRNAs in eukaryotes.
26635829	Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as versatile master regulator of biological functions in recent years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous ncRNAs of 18-24 nucleotides in length that originates from long self-complementary precursors. Besides their direct involvement in developmental processes, plant miRNAs play key roles in gene regulatory networks and varied biological processes. Alternatively, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are a large and diverse class of transcribed ncRNAs whose length exceed that of 200 nucleotides. Plant lncRNAs are transcribed by different RNA polymerases, showing diverse structural features. Plant lncRNAs also are important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological processes. There has been a breakthrough in the technology of genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology, in the last decade. CRISPR loci are transcribed into ncRNA and eventually form a functional complex with Cas9 and further guide the complex to cleave complementary invading DNA. The CRISPR-Cas technology has been successfully applied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and tobacco and important crops like wheat, maize, and rice. However, all these studies are focused on protein coding genes. Information about targeting non-coding genes is scarce. Hitherto, the CRISPR-Cas technology has been exclusively used in vertebrate systems to engineer miRNA/lncRNAs, but it is still relatively unexplored in plants. While briefing miRNAs, lncRNAs and applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology in human and animals, this review essentially elaborates several strategies to overcome the challenges of applying the CRISPR-Cas technology in editing ncRNAs in plants and the future perspective of this field.
26585422	Different pathogenicities of Rice stripe virus from the insect vector and from viruliferous plants.	2016	New Phytol	Persistent plant viruses usually depend on insects for their transmission; they cannot be transmitted between plants or through mechanical inoculation. However, the mechanism by which persistent viruses become pathogenic in insect vectors remains unknown. In this study, we used Rice stripe virus (RSV), its insect vector Laodelphax striatellus and host plant (Oryza sativa) to explore how persistent viruses acquire pathogenicity from insect vectors. RSV acquired phytopathogenicity in both the alimentary tract and the salivary gland of L. striatellus. We mechanically inoculated RSV into rice O. sativa leaves through midrib microinjection. Insect-derived RSV induced a typical stripe symptom, whereas plant-derived RSV only produced chlorosis in rice leaves. Insect-derived RSV had higher expression of genes rdrp, ns2, nsvc2, sp and nsvc4 than plant-derived RSV, and the latter had higher expression of genes cp and ns3 than the former in rice leaves. Different from plant-derived RSV, insect-derived RSV damaged grana stacks within the chloroplast and inhibited photosynthesis by suppressing the photosystem II subunit psbp. This study not only presented a convenient method to mechanically inoculate RSV into plants, but also provided insights into the different pathogenic mechanisms of RSV from the insect vector and from viruliferous plants.
26600014	Glutathione Peroxidase of Pennisetum glaucum (PgGPx) Is a Functional Cd2+ Dependent Peroxiredoxin that Enhances Tolerance against Salinity and Drought Stress.	2015	PLoS One	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise in the plant system due to inevitable influence of various environmental stimuli. Glutathione peroxidases are one of the important ROS scavengers inside the cell. A glutathione peroxidase (PgGPx) gene was previously found from Pennisetum glauccum abiotic stressed cDNA library. Enzyme kinetics data revealed that PgGPx possessed preference towards thioredoxin rather than glutathione as electron donor and thus belongs to the functional peroxiredoxin group. Moreover, its activity was found to be dependent on divalent cations, especially Cd2+ and homology model showed the presence of Cd2+ binding site in the protein. Site directed mutagenesis study of PgGPx protein revealed the vital role of two conserved Cysteine residues for its enzymatic activity and structural folding. Expression analysis suggested that PgGPx transcript is highly up-regulated in response to salinity and drought stresses. When expressed ectopically, PgGPx showed enhanced tolerance against multiple abiotic stresses in prokaryotic E. coli and model plant, rice. Transgenic rice plants showed lesser accumulation of MDA and H2O2; and higher accumulation of proline as compared to wild type (WT) plants in response to both salinity and drought stresses that clearly indicates suppression of lipid peroxidation and ROS generation in transgenic lines. Moreover, transgenic plants maintained better photosynthesis efficiency and higher level of antioxidant enzyme activity as compared to WT plants under stress conditions. These results clearly indicate the imperative role of PgGPx in cellular redox homeostasis under stress conditions, leading to the maintenance of membrane integrity and increased tolerance towards oxidative stress.
26545757	Evaluation of a recombinant insect-derived amylase performance in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process with industrial yeasts.	2016	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Starch is the dominant feedstock consumed for the bioethanol production, accounting for 60 % of its global production. Considering the significant contribution of bioethanol to the global fuel market, any improvement in its major operating technologies is economically very attractive. It was estimated that up to 40 % of the final ethanol unit price is derived from the energy input required for the substrate pre-treatment. Application of raw starch hydrolyzing enzymes (RSHE), combined with operation of the process according to a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) strategy, constitutes the most promising solutions to the current technologies limitations. In this study, we expressed the novel RSHE derived from an insect in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain dedicated for the protein overexpression. Afterwards, the enzyme performance was assessed in SSF process conducted by industrial ethanologenic or thermotolerant yeast species. Comparison of the insect-derived RSHE preparation with commercially available amylolytic RSH preparation was conducted. Our results demonstrate that the recombinant alpha-amylase from rice weevil can be efficiently expressed and secreted with its native signal peptide in S. cerevisiae INVSc-pYES2-Amy1 expression system (accounting for nearly 72 % of the strain's secretome). Application of the recombinant enzyme-based preparation in SSF process secured sufficient amylolytic activity for the yeast cell propagation and ethanol formation from raw starch. (Oligo)saccharide profiles generated by the compared preparations differed with respect to homogeneity of the sugar mixtures. Concomitantly, as demonstrated by a kinetic model developed in this study, the kinetic parameters describing activity of the compared preparations were different.
26528551	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.	2015	PLoS One	Arginase is the only enzyme capable of producing urea in plants. This enzyme also contributes to many important biological functions during plant growth and development, such as seed development, root development and plant nitrogen using. The unique rice arginase gene OsARG is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice. In this study, we transformed OsARG into upland cotton R18 by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation and analyzed the function of OsARG in transgenic cotton. Two independent OsARG expression transgenic cotton lines, ARG-26 and ARG-38, were obtained via transformation. Southern blot analysis indicated that two copies and one copy of the OsARG gene were integrated into the ARG-26 and ARG-38 genomes, respectively. Enzyme activity and RNA transcription analysis revealed that the OsARG gene is highly expressed in cotton. The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene. Field experiments indicated that the polyamine and nitrogen content increased by more than two-fold in the T3 generation plants of the transgenic cotton lines ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8, and ARG-38-11, as compared with the control plants. After harvesting cotton fibers grown in field conditions, we analyzed the quality of fiber and found that the fiber length was increased in the transgenic lines. The average cotton fiber length for all of the transgenic cotton lines was two millimeters longer than the fibers of the control plants; the average cotton fiber lengths were 31.94 mm, 32.00 mm, 32.68 mm and 32.84 mm in the ARG-26ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8 and ARG-38-11 lines, respectively, but the average fiber length of the control plants was 29.36mm. Our results indicate that the OsARG gene could potentially be used to improve cotton fiber length traits.
26606179	Response of two rice cultivars differing in their sensitivity towards arsenic, differs in their expression of glutaredoxin and glutathione S transferase genes and antioxidant usage.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Embodied study investigates the role of GRX and associated antioxidant enzymes in the detoxification mechanism between arsenic (As) sensitive (Usar-3) and tolerant cultivar (Pant Dhan 11) of Oryza sativa against As(III) and As(V), under GSH enriched, and GSH deprived conditions. The overall growth and physiological parameters in sensitive cultivar were lower than the tolerant cultivar, against various treatments of As(III) and As(V). The As accumulation in sensitive cv. against both As(III) and As(V) was lower than the corresponding treatments in tolerant cv. However, the As translocation against As(V) was lower (35% and 64%, resp.) than that of As(III), in both the cultivars. In sensitive cv. translocation of Zn and Cu was influenced by both As(V) and As(III) whereas, in tolerant cv. the translocation of Cu, Mn and Zn was influenced only by As(III). Translocation of Fe was negatively influenced by translocation of As in sensitive cv. and positively in tolerant cv. Strong correlation between H2O2, SOD, GRX, GR, GST and GSH/GSSG in sensitive cv. and between DHAR, APX, MDHAR and AsA in tolerant cv. demonstrates the underlying preference of GSH as electron donor for detoxification of H2O2 in sensitive cv. and AsA in tolerant cv. Higher expression of the four GRX and two GST genes in the sensitive cv. than tolerant cv, suggests that under As stress, GRX are synthesized more in the sensitive cv. than tolerant cv. Also, the expression of four GRX genes were higher against As(V) than As(III). The higher As accumulation in the tolerant cv. is due to lower GST expression, is attributed to the absence of thiolation and sequestration of As in roots, the translocation of As to shoots is higher.
26615033	OsSIZ1, a SUMO E3 Ligase Gene, is Involved in the Regulation of the Responses to Phosphate and Nitrogen in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	SIZ1-mediated SUMOylation regulates hormone signaling as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. Here, we investigated the expression profile of OsSIZ1 in rice using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and pOsSIZ1-GUS transgenic plants, and the function of OsSIZ1 in the responses to phosphate and nitrogen using a reverse genetics approach. OsSIZ1 is constitutively expressed throughout the vegetative and reproductive growth of rice, with stronger promoter activities in vascular bundles of culms. ossiz1 mutants had shorter primary roots and adventitious roots than wild-type plants, suggesting that OsSIZ1 is associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Total phosphorus (P) and phosphate (Pi) concentrations in both roots and shoots of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased irrespective of Pi supply conditions compared with the wild type. Pi concentration in the xylem sap of ossiz1 mutants was significantly higher than that of the wild type under a Pi-sufficient growth regime. Total nitrogen (N) concentrations in the most detected tissues of ossiz1 mutants were significantly increased compared with the wild type. Analysis of mineral contents in ossiz1 mutants indicated that OsSIZ1 functions specifically in Pi and N responses, not those of other nutrients examined, in rice. Further, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple genes involved in Pi starvation signaling and N transport and assimilation were altered in ossiz1 mutants. Together, these results suggested that OsSIZ1 may act as a regulator of the Pi (N)-dependent responses in rice.
26608643	FLOURY ENDOSPERM7 encodes a regulator of starch synthesis and amyloplast development essential for peripheral endosperm development in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	In cereal crops, starch synthesis and storage depend mainly on a specialized class of plastids, termed amyloplasts. Despite the importance of starch, the molecular machinery regulating starch synthesis and amyloplast development remains largely unknown. Here, we report the characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) floury endosperm7 (flo7) mutant, which develops a floury-white endosperm only in the periphery and not in the inner portion. Consistent with the phenotypic alternation in flo7 endosperm, the flo7 mutant had reduced amylose content and seriously disrupted amylopectin structure only in the peripheral endosperm. Notably, flo7 peripheral endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound starch grain development. Map-based cloning of FLO7 revealed that it encodes a protein of unknown function. FLO7 harbors an N-terminal transit peptide capable of targeting functional FLO7 fused to green fluorescent protein to amyloplast stroma in developing endosperm cells, and a domain of unknown function 1338 (DUF1338) that is highly conserved in green plants. Furthermore, our combined β-glucuronidase activity and RNA in situ hybridization assays showed that the FLO7 gene was expressed ubiquitously but exhibited a specific expression in the endosperm periphery. Moreover, a set of in vivo experiments demonstrated that the missing 32 aa in the flo7 mutant protein are essential for the stable accumulation of FLO7 in the endosperm. Together, our findings identify FLO7 as a unique plant regulator required for starch synthesis and amyloplast development within the peripheral endosperm and provide new insights into the spatial regulation of endosperm development in rice.
26646900	High-resolution mapping of H4K16 and H3K23 acetylation reveals conserved and unique distribution patterns in Arabidopsis and rice.	2015	Epigenetics	Histone acetylation and deacetylation are key epigenetic gene regulatory mechanisms that play critical roles in eukaryotes. Acetylation of histone 4 lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is implicated in many cellular processes. However, its biological function and relationship with transcription are largely unexplored in plants. We generated first genome-wide high-resolution maps of H4K16ac in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We showed that H4K16ac is preferentially enriched around the transcription start sites and positively correlates with gene expression levels. Co-existence of H4K16ac and H3K23ac is correlated with high gene expression levels, suggesting a potentially combinatorial effect of H4K16ac and H3K23ac histone 3 lysine 23 acetylation on gene expression. Our data further revealed that while genes enriched with both H4K16ac and H3K23ac are ubiquitously expressed, genes enriched with only H4K16ac or H3K23ac showed significantly distinct expression patterns in association with particular developmental stages. Unexpectedly, and unlike in Arabidopsis, there are significant levels of both H4K16ac and H3K23ac in the lowly expressed genes in rice. Furthermore, we found that H4K16ac-enriched genes are associated with different biological processes in Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting a potentially species-specific role of H4K16ac in plants. Together, our genome-wide profiling reveals the conserved and unique distribution patterns of H4K16ac and H3K23ac in Arabidopsis and rice and provides a foundation for further understanding their function in plants.
26615032	Differential Expression of Genes of the Calvin-Benson Cycle and its Related Genes During Leaf Development in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	To understand how the machinery for photosynthetic carbon assimilation is formed and maintained during leaf development, changes in the mRNA levels of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase and two key enzymes for sucrose synthesis were determined in rice (Oryza sativa L.). According to the patterns of changes in the mRNA levels, these genes were categorized into three groups. Group 1 included most of the genes involved in the carboxylation and reduction phases of the Calvin-Benson cycle, as well as three genes in the regeneration phase. The mRNA levels increased and reached maxima during leaf expansion and then rapidly declined, although there were some variations in the residual mRNA levels in senescent leaves. Group 2 included a number of genes involved in the regeneration phase, one gene in the reduction phase of the Calvin-Benson cycle and one gene in sucrose synthesis. The mRNA levels increased and almost reached maxima before full expansion and then gradually declined. Group 3 included Rubisco activase, one gene involved in the regeneration phase and one gene in sucrose synthesis. The overall pattern was similar to that in group 2 genes except that the mRNA levels reached maxima after the stage of full expansion. Thus, genes of the Calvin-Benson cycle and its related genes were differentially expressed during leaf development in rice, suggesting that such differential gene expression is necessary for formation and maintenance of the machinery of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.
26600547	Development of primer pairs from diverse chloroplast genomes for use in plant phylogenetic research.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Variation in the chloroplast DNA sequence is useful for plant phylogenetic studies. However, the number of variable sequences provided by chloroplast DNA for suggested genes or genomic regions in plant phylogenetic analyses is often inadequate. To identify conserved regions that can be used to design primers and amplify variable sequences for use in plant phylogenetic studies, the complete chloroplast genomic sequences of six plant species (including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and Phaseolus vulgaris), searched from the taxonomy database of NCBI were investigated. A total of 93 conserved regions, 32 in large single copy and 61 in inverted repeat regions, were identified. A set of five primer pairs were designed according to the conserved sequences located in the psbA~trnK, psbB~psbH, rpl23~trnI, trnR~trnN, and trnY~trnD regions to amplify variable DNA fragments. An additional 18 plant accessions from 14 species were used to validate their utility. Each of the tested species could be distinguished by length polymorphisms of fragments amplified with the five primer pairs. trnR~trnN and rpl23~trnI amplified fragments specific to monocot and legume species, respectively. Three primer pairs located in the psbA~trnK, psbB~psbH, and trnR~trnN regions were applied to amplify variable DNA sequences for phylogenetic analysis using the maximum parsimony method. The consistent result between taxonomy and phylogenetic analysis on the variable sequences amplified with these three primer pairs was revealed. The five newly developed primer pairs are recommended as tools for use in the identification of plant species and in phylogenetic studies.
26687010	PDH45 transgenic rice maintain cell viability through lower accumulation of Na(+), ROS and calcium homeostasis in roots under salinity stress.	2016	J Plant Physiol	Salinity severely affects the growth/productivity of rice, which is utilized as major staple food crop worldwide. PDH45 (pea DNA helicase 45), a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, actively provides salinity stress tolerance, but the mechanism behind this is not well known. Therefore, in order to understand the mechanism of stress tolerance, sodium ion (Na(+)), reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytosolic calcium [Ca(2+)]cyt and cell viability were analyzed in roots of PDH45 transgenic-IR64 rice lines along with wild-type (WT) IR64 rice under salinity stress (100mM and 200 mM NaCl). In addition, the roots of salinity-tolerant (FL478) and susceptible (Pusa-44) rice varieties were also analyzed under salinity stress for comparative analysis. The results reveal that, under salinity stress (100mM and 200 mM NaCl), roots of PDH45 transgenic lines accumulate lower levels of Na(+), ROS and maintain [Ca(2+)]cyt and exhibit higher cell viability as compared with roots of WT (IR64) plants. Similar results were also obtained in the salinity-tolerant FL478 rice. However, the roots of WT and salinity-susceptible Pusa-44 rice accumulated higher levels of Na(+), ROS and [Ca(2+)]cyt imbalance and lower cell viability during salinity stress, which is in contrast to the overexpressing PDH45 transgenic lines and salinity-tolerant FL478 rice. Further, to understand the mechanism of PDH45 at molecular level, comparative expression profiling of 12 cation transporters/genes was also conducted in roots of WT (IR64) and overexpressing PDH45 transgenic lines (L1 and L2) under salt stress (24h of 200 mM NaCl). The expression analysis results show altered and differential gene expression of cation transporters/genes in salt-stressed roots of WT (IR64) and overexpressing transgenic lines (L1 and L2). These observations collectively suggest that, under salinity stress conditions, PDH45 is involved in the regulation of Na(+) level, ROS production, [Ca(2+)]cyt homeostasis, cell viability and cation transporters in roots of PDH45 transgenic-IR64 rice and consequently provide salinity tolerance. Elucidating the detailed regulatory mechanism of PDH45 will provide a better understanding of salinity stress tolerance and further open new ways to manipulate genome to achieve higher agricultural production under stress.
26574735	Dissection of the genetic architecture of rice resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Resistance in rice cultivars to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is complex and is controlled by both major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) that was genotyped using a high-density (700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms) array and inoculated with five diverse M. oryzae isolates. We identified 97 loci associated with blast resistance (LABRs). Among them, 82 were new regions and 15 co-localized with known blast resistance loci. The top 72 LABRs explained up to 98% of the phenotypic variation. The candidate genes in the LABRs encode nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance proteins, receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors and defence-related proteins. Among them, LABR_64 was strongly associated with resistance to all five isolates. We analysed the function of candidate genes underlying LABR_64 using RNA interference (RNAi) technology and identified two new resistance alleles at the Pi5 locus. We demonstrate an efficient strategy for rapid allele discovery using the power of GWAS, coupled with RNAi technology, for the dissection of complex blast resistance in rice.
26578190	OsHKT2;2/1-mediated Na(+) influx over K(+) uptake in roots potentially increases toxic Na(+) accumulation in a salt-tolerant landrace of rice Nona Bokra upon salinity stress.	2016	J Plant Res	HKT transporters are Na(+)-permeable membrane proteins, which mediate Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis in K(+)-depleted and saline environments in plants. Class II HKT transporters, a distinct subgroup found predominantly in monocots, are known to mediate Na(+)-K(+) co-transport in principle. Here we report features of ion transport functions of No-OsHKT2;2/1, a class II transporter identified in a salt tolerant landrace of indica rice, Nona Bokra. We profiled No-OsHKT2;2/1 expression in organs of Nona Bokra plants with or without salinity stress. Dominant accumulation of the No-OsHKT2;2/1 transcript in K(+)-starved roots of Nona Bokra plants largely disappeared in response to 50 mM NaCl. We found that No-OsHKT2;2/1 expressed in the high-affinity K(+) uptake deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes shows robust K(+) selectivity even in the presence of a large amount of NaCl as reported previously. However, No-OsHKT2;2/1-expressing yeast cells exhibited Na(+) hypersensitive growth under various concentrations of K(+) and Na(+) as the cells expressing Po-OsHKT2;2, a similar class II transporter from another salt tolerant indica rice Pokkali, when compared with the growth of cells harboring empty vector or cells expressing OsHKT2;4. The OsHKT2;4 protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed strong K(+) selectivity in the presence of 50 mM NaCl in comparison with No-OsHKT2;2/1 and Po-OsHKT2;2. Together with apparent plasma membrane-localization of No-OsHKT2;2/1, these results point to possibilities that No-OsHKT2;2/1 could mediate destructive Na(+) influx over K(+) uptake in Nona Bokra plants upon salinity stress, and that a predominant physiological function of No-OsHKT2;2/1 might be the acquisition of Na(+) and K(+) in K(+)-limited environments.
26613898	Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of early seed development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed serves as a major food source for over half of the global population. Though it has been long recognized that phosphorylation plays an essential role in rice seed development, the phosphorylation events and dynamics in this process remain largely unknown so far. Here, we report the first large scale identification of rice seed phosphoproteins and phosphosites by using a quantitative phosphoproteomic approach. Thorough proteomic studies in pistils and seeds at 3, 7 days after pollination resulted in the successful identification of 3885, 4313 and 4135 phosphopeptides respectively. A total of 2487 proteins were differentially phosphorylated among the three stages, including Kip related protein 1, Rice basic leucine zipper factor 1, Rice prolamin box binding factor and numerous other master regulators of rice seed development. Moreover, differentially phosphorylated proteins may be extensively involved in the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of phytohormones such as auxin, gibberellin, abscisic acid and brassinosteroid. Our results strongly indicated that protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism regulating cell proliferation and enlargement, phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling, grain filling and grain quality during rice seed development. Overall, the current study enhanced our understanding of the rice phosphoproteome and shed novel insight into the regulatory mechanism of rice seed development.
26617267	Generation of artificial drooping leaf mutants by CRISPR-Cas9 technology in rice.	2016	Genes Genet Syst	CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which uses an RNA-guided nuclease, has been developed as an efficient and versatile genome-editing method to induce mutations in genes of interest. To examine the feasibility of this method in developmental studies of a model monocot, rice (Oryza sativa), we introduced the construct gDL-1, which produced a guide RNA targeting the DROOPING LEAF (DL) gene. DL regulates midrib formation in the leaf and carpel specification in the flower. Because loss of function of DL causes the drooping leaf phenotype in regenerated seedlings, the effect of gene disruption should be easily detected. In transgenic plants carrying gDL-1, the DL gene was disrupted at high efficiency: seven out of nine plants examined had bi-allelic mutations. All transgenic plants with the bi-allelic mutation showed the drooping leaf phenotype. Observation of cross sections of the leaf blade clearly indicated that these transgenic plants failed to make midrib structures, and were comparable to the severe dl mutant dl-sup1. Thus, CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be a useful and efficient tool in developmental studies in rice.
26531864	Analysis of the TCP genes expressed in the inflorescence of the orchid Orchis italica.	2015	Sci Rep	TCP proteins are plant-specific transcription factors involved in many different processes. Because of their involvement in a large number of developmental pathways, their roles have been investigated in various plant species. However, there are almost no studies of this transcription factor family in orchids. Based on the available transcriptome of the inflorescence of the orchid Orchis italica, in the present study we identified 12 transcripts encoding TCP proteins. The phylogenetic analysis showed that they belong to different TCP classes (I and II) and groups (PCF, CIN and CYC/TB1), and that they display a number of conserved motifs when compared with the TCPs of Arabidopsis and Oryza. The presence of a specific cleavage site for the microRNA miRNA319, an important post-transcriptional regulator of several TCP genes in other species, was demonstrated for one transcript of O. italica, and the analysis of the expression pattern of the TCP transcripts in different inflorescence organs and in leaf tissue suggests that some TCP transcripts of O. italica exert their role only in specific tissues, while others may play multiple roles in different tissues. In addition, the evolutionary analysis showed a general purifying selection acting on the coding region of these transcripts.
26612070	Functional testing of a PF02458 homologue of putative rice arabinoxylan feruloyl transferase genes in Brachypodium distachyon.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: We show that changing the expression of a putative feruloyl transferase gene belonging to the BAHD acyl-transferase family alters the levels of cell wall esterified ferulates and diferulates in Brachypodium distachyon cell walls. While the potential of grass cell walls for biofuel production has been realized, the technology for lignocellulosic biomass conversion for the production of ethanol is still inefficient because of structural mechanisms that plants have evolved to make the cell wall recalcitrant to enzymatic attack. One of these mechanisms in grasses involves the esterification of arabinoxylans in the cell wall with ferulic acid via an ester linkage to arabinose side chains on xylans. These ferulates undergo oxidative coupling reactions to form ferulate dimers, thus crosslinking polysaccharides. Arabinoxylan feruloylation is an important factor that determines cell wall recalcitrance because it directly cross-links xylans and because ferulates act as nucleating sites for the formation of lignin and for the linkage of lignin to the xylan/cellulose network. Here we report on the effects of changing the expression of Bradi2g43520 (BdAT1), a homologue of the rice feruloyl transferase gene Os01g42880 belonging to the Pfam PF02458 family, in Brachypodium distachyon. Down regulation in several independent RNAi::BdAT1 lines, resulted in up to a 35 % reduction of ferulate levels in both leaves and stems compared to control plants, over 2-3 generations of selfing. In contrast, overexpression of putative BdAT1 resulted in an increase of up to 58 and 47 % of ferulate levels in leaves and stems, respectively, compared to control plants and analyzed over 2-3 generations of selfing. These findings suggest that Bradi2g43520 may be a good candidate for feruloylation of AX in Brachypodium.
26337117	Differential activation of genes related to aluminium tolerance in two contrasting rice cultivars.	2015	J Inorg Biochem	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly Al-tolerant crop. Among other mechanisms, a higher expression of STAR1/STAR2 (sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1/2) genes and of Nrat1 (NRAMP Aluminium Transporter 1), and ALS1 (Aluminium sensitive 1) can at least in part be responsible for the inducible Al tolerance in this species. Here we analysed the responses to Al in two contrasting rice varieties. All analysed toxicity/tolerance markers (root elongation, Evans blue, morin and haematoxylin staining) indicated higher Al-tolerance in variety Nipponbare, than in variety Modan. Nipponbare accumulated much less Al in the roots than Modan. Aluminium supply caused stronger expression of STAR1 in Nipponbare than in Modan. A distinctively higher increase of Al-induced abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation was found in the roots of Nipponbare than in Modan. Highest ABA levels were observed in Nipponbare after 48 h exposure to Al. This ABA peak was coincident in time with the highest expression level of STAR1. It is proposed that ABA may be required for cell wall remodulation facilitated by the enhanced UDP-glucose transport to the walls through STAR1/STAR2. Contrastingly, in the roots of Modan the expression of both Nrat1 coding for a plasma membrane Al-transporter and of ALS1 coding for a tonoplast-localized Al transporter was considerably enhanced. Moreover, Modan had a higher Al-induced expression of ASR1 a gene that has been proposed to code for a reactive oxygen scavenging protein. In conclusion, the Al-exclusion strategy of Nipponbare, at least in part mediated by STAR1 and probably regulated by ABA, provided better protection against Al toxicity than the accumulation and internal detoxification strategy of Modan mediated by Nrat1, ALS1 and ARS1.
26600549	Verification and evaluation of grain QTLs using RILs from TD70 x Kasalath in rice.	2015	Genet Mol Res	Grain size is an important trait that directly influences the yield of rice. Validation and evaluation of grain genes is important in rice genetic studies and for breeding. In a population of 240 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between an extra-large grain japonica variety TD70 and a small grain indica variety Kasalath, we mapped 19 QTLs controlling grain traits. These QTLs included six cloned grain genes, namely, GW2, GS3, qSW5, qGL3, GS5, and GW8. All of the alleles with the optimal effects on grain size came from TD70, the variety with extra-large grains. To verify these gene loci, we cloned and sequenced GW2, GS3, GW5 (qSW5), qGL3, GS5, GW8, and TGW6 in TD70 and Kasalath, and found several functional polymorphisms in the sequences of the genes. New functional markers for the cloned genes were designed to identify parents and RILs. The contributions of these polymorphisms to the improvement in rice grain size traits were evaluated. Our results indicate that at least six functional polymorphisms have additive effects on grain shape and that one non-functional polymorphism in TGW6 affects grain shape in TD70. The newly designed markers will be useful in further studies to identify functional grain genes. Our findings provide insight into the control of grain size in rice, and they will be of value for improving rice grain yield.
26640473	Integrated Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Analysis Identifies Important Traits and Mechanisms Associated with Differential Response of Rice Genotypes to Elevated Temperature.	2015	Front Plant Sci	In changing climatic conditions, heat stress caused by high temperature poses a serious threat to rice cultivation. A multiple organizational analysis at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels is required to fully understand the impact of elevated temperature in rice. This study was aimed at deciphering the elevated temperature response in 11 popular and mega rice cultivars widely grown in India. Physiological and biochemical traits specifically membrane thermostability (MTS), antioxidants, and photosynthesis were studied at vegetative and reproductive phases, which were used to establish a correlation with grain yield under stress. Several useful traits in different genotypes were identified, which will be an important resource to develop high temperature-tolerant rice cultivars. Interestingly, Nagina22 emerged as the best performer in terms of yield as well as expression of physiological and biochemical traits at elevated temperature. It showed lesser relative injury, lesser reduction in chlorophyll content, increased super oxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase activities, lesser reduction in net photosynthetic rate (P N ), high transpiration rate (E), and other photosynthetic/fluorescence parameters contributing to least reduction in spikelet fertility and grain yield at elevated temperature. Furthermore, expression of 14 genes including heat shock transcription factors and heat shock proteins was analyzed in Nagina22 (tolerant) and Vandana (susceptible) at flowering phase, strengthening the fact that N22 performed better at molecular level also during elevated temperature. This study shows that elevated temperature response is complex and involves multiple biological processes that are needed to be characterized to address the challenges of extreme conditions of future climate.
26522477	The syntaxin protein (MoSyn8) mediates intracellular trafficking to regulate conidiogenesis and pathogenicity of rice blast fungus.	2016	New Phytol	Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) mediate cellular membrane fusion and intracellular vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells, and are critical in the growth and development of pathogenic fungi such as Magnaporthe oryzae which causes rice blast. Rice blast is thought to involve distinct SNARE-mediated transport and secretion of fungal effector proteins into the host to modulate rice immunity. We have previously characterized two SNARE proteins, secretory protein (MoSec22) and vesicle-associated membrane protein (MoVam7), as being important in cellular transport and pathogenicity. Here, we show that syntaxin 8 (MoSyn8), a Qc-SNARE protein homolog, also plays important roles in growth, conidiation, and pathogenicity. The MoSYN8 deletion mutant (∆Mosyn8) mutant exhibits defects in endocytosis and F-actin organization, appressorium turgor pressure generation, and host penetration. In addition, the ∆Mosyn8 mutant cannot elaborate biotrophic invasion of the susceptible rice host, or secrete avirulence factors Avr-Pia (corresponding to the rice resistance gene Pia) and Avrpiz-t (the cognate Avr gene for the resistance gene Piz-t) proteins. Our study of MoSyn8 advances our understanding of SNARE proteins in effector secretion which underlies the normal physiology and pathogenicity of M. oryzae, and it sheds new light on the mechanism of the blight disease caused by M. oryzae.
26610268	Dual RNA-seq reveals Meloidogyne graminicola transcriptome and candidate effectors during the interaction with rice plants.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Root-knot nematodes secrete proteinaceous effectors into plant tissues to facilitate infection by suppressing host defences and reprogramming the host metabolism to their benefit. Meloidogyne graminicola is a major pest of rice (Oryza sativa) in Asia and Latin America, causing important crop losses. The goal of this study was to identify M. graminicola pathogenicity genes expressed during the plant-nematode interaction. Using the dual RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) strategy, we generated transcriptomic data of M. graminicola samples covering the pre-parasitic J2 stage and five parasitic stages in rice plants, from the parasitic J2 to the adult female. In the absence of a reference genome, a de novo M. graminicola transcriptome of 66 396 contigs was obtained from those reads that were not mapped on the rice genome. Gene expression profiling across the M. graminicola life cycle revealed key genes involved in nematode development and provided insights into the genes putatively associated with parasitism. The development of a 'secreted protein prediction' pipeline revealed a typical set of proteins secreted by nematodes, as well as a large number of cysteine-rich proteins and putative nuclear proteins. Combined with expression data, this pipeline enabled the identification of 15 putative effector genes, including two homologues of well-characterized effectors from cyst nematodes (CLE-like and VAP1) and a metallothionein. The localization of gene expression was assessed by in situ hybridization for a subset of candidates. All of these data represent important molecular resources for the elucidation of M. graminicola biology and for the selection of potential targets for the development of novel control strategies for this nematode species.
26560141	NOD promoter-controlled AtIRT1 expression functions synergistically with NAS and FERRITIN genes to increase iron in rice grains.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population, but it contains only low amounts of bioavailable micronutrients for human nutrition. Consequently, micronutrient deficiency is a widespread health problem among people who depend primarily on rice as their staple food. Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most serious forms of malnutrition. Biofortification of rice grains for increased iron content is an effective strategy to reduce iron deficiency. Unlike other grass species, rice takes up iron as Fe(II) via the IRON REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT) in addition to Fe(III)-phytosiderophore chelates. We expressed Arabidopsis IRT1 (AtIRT1) under control of the Medicago sativa EARLY NODULIN 12B promoter in our previously developed high-iron NFP rice lines expressing NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE (AtNAS1) and FERRITIN. Transgenic rice lines expressing AtIRT1 alone had significant increases in iron and combined with NAS and FERRITIN increased iron to 9.6 µg/g DW in the polished grains that is 2.2-fold higher as compared to NFP lines. The grains of AtIRT1 lines also accumulated more copper and zinc but not manganese. Our results demonstrate that the concerted expression of AtIRT1, AtNAS1 and PvFERRITIN synergistically increases iron in both polished and unpolished rice grains. AtIRT1 is therefore a valuable transporter for iron biofortification programs when used in combination with other genes encoding iron transporters and/or storage proteins.
26466747	Genetic diversity for mycorrhizal symbiosis and phosphate transporters in rice.	2015	J Integr Plant Biol	Phosphorus (P) is a major plant nutrient and developing crops with higher P-use efficiency is an important breeding goal. In this context we have conducted a comparative study of irrigated and rainfed rice varieties to assess genotypic differences in colonization with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and expression of different P transporter genes. Plants were grown in three different soil samples from a rice farm in the Philippines. The data show that AM symbiosis in all varieties was established after 4 weeks of growth under aerobic conditions and that, in soil derived from a rice paddy, natural AM populations recovered within 6 weeks. The analysis of AM marker genes (AM1, AM3, AM14) and P transporter genes for the direct Pi uptake (PT2, PT6) and AM-mediated pathway (PT11, PT13) were largely in agreement with the observed root AM colonization providing a useful tool for diversity studies. Interestingly, delayed AM colonization was observed in the aus-type rice varieties which might be due to their different root structure and might confer an advantage for weed competition in the field. The data further showed that P-starvation induced root growth and expression of the high-affinity P transporter PT6 was highest in the irrigated variety IR66 which also maintained grain yield under P-deficient field conditions.
26530637	Cloning of novel rice blast resistance genes from two rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Most rice blast resistance genes (R-genes) encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Our previous study has shown that more rice blast R-genes can be cloned in rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families. In the present study, two rapidly evolving R-gene families in rice were selected for cloning a subset of genes from their paralogs in three resistant rice lines. A total of eight functional blast R-genes were identified among nine NBS-LRR genes, and some of these showed resistance to three or more blast strains. Evolutionary analysis indicated that high nucleotide diversity of coding regions served as important parameters in the determination of gene resistance. We also observed that amino-acid variants (nonsynonymous mutations, insertions, or deletions) in essential motifs of the NBS domain contribute to the blast resistance capacity of NBS-LRR genes. These results suggested that the NBS regions might also play an important role in resistance specificity determination. On the other hand, different splicing patterns of introns were commonly observed in R-genes. The results of the present study contribute to improving the effectiveness of R-gene identification by using evolutionary analysis method and acquisition of novel blast resistance genes.
26674380	Dynamic and Coordinated Expression Changes of Rice Small RNAs in Response to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2015	J Genet Genomics	Endogenous small RNAs are newly identified players in plant immune responses, yet their roles in rice (Oryza sativa) responding to pathogens are still less understood, especially for pathogens that can cause severe yield losses. We examined the small RNA expression profiles of rice leaves at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours post infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) virulent strain PXO99, the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Dynamic expression changes of some miRNAs and trans-acting siRNAs were identified, together with a few novel miRNA targets, including an RLK gene targeted by osa-miR159a.1. Coordinated expression changes were observed among some small RNAs in response to Xoo infection, with small RNAs exhibiting the same expression pattern tended to regulate genes in the same or related signaling pathways, including auxin and GA signaling pathways, nutrition and defense-related pathways. These findings reveal the dynamic and complex roles of small RNAs in rice-Xoo interactions, and identify new targets for regulating plant responses to Xoo.
26614751	Apoplasmic loading in the rice phloem supported by the presence of sucrose synthase and plasma membrane-localized proton pyrophosphatase.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although Oryza sativa (rice) is one of the most important cereal crops, the mechanism by which sucrose, the major photosynthate, is loaded into its phloem is still a matter of debate. Current opinion holds that the phloem loading pathway in rice could involve either a symplasmic or an apoplasmic route. It was hypothesized, on the basis of a complementary body of evidence from arabidopsis, which is an apoplasmic loader, that the membrane specificity of proton pyrophosphatases (H(+)-PPases; OVPs) in the sieve element-companion cell (SE-CC) complexes of rice source leaves would support the existence of either of the aforementioned phloem loading mechanisms. Additionally, it was contended that the presence of sucrose synthase in the SE-CC complexes would be consistent with an apoplasmic sucrose loading route in rice.

METHODS: Conventional chemical fixation methods were used for immunohistochemical localization of H(+)-PPases and sucrose synthase in rice and arabidopsis at the light microscopy level, while ultrastructural immunogold labelling of H(+)-PPases and sucrose synthase was performed on high-pressure frozen source leaves of rice.

KEY RESULTS: Using immunogold labelling, it was found that OVPs predominantly localize at the plasma membrane (PM) of the SE-CC complexes in rice source leaf minor veins, while in the root meristematic cells, OVPs preferentially localize at the vacuoles. The PM specificity of OPVs in the SE-CC complexes was deemed to support apoplasmic loading in the rice phloem. Further backing for this interpretation came from the sucrose synthase-specific immunogold labelling at the SE-CC complexes of rice source leaves.

CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the idea that, in the same way as in arabidopsis and a majority of grasses, sucrose is actively loaded into the SE-CC complexes of rice leaves using an apoplasmic step.
26590017	Suppression of OsKu80 results in defects in developmental growth and increased telomere length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability in humans and yeasts. In this report, we identified and characterized OsKu80 in rice, a model monocot crop. OsKu80 forms a heterodimer with OsKu70 in yeast and plant cells, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. RNAi-mediated knock-down T3 transgenic rice plants (Ubi:RNAi-OsKu80) displayed a retarded growth phenotype at the post-germination stage. In addition, the Ubi:RNAi-OsKu80 knock-down progeny exhibited noticeably increased telomere length as compared to wild-type rice. These results are discussed with the idea that OsKu80 plays a role in developmental growth and telomere length regulation in rice plants.
26556651	Finding the Subcellular Location of Barley, Wheat, Rice and Maize Proteins: The Compendium of Crop Proteins with Annotated Locations (cropPAL).	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Barley, wheat, rice and maize provide the bulk of human nutrition and have extensive industrial use as agricultural products. The genomes of these crops each contains >40,000 genes encoding proteins; however, the major genome databases for these species lack annotation information of protein subcellular location for >80% of these gene products. We address this gap, by constructing the compendium of crop protein subcellular locations called crop Proteins with Annotated Locations (cropPAL). Subcellular location is most commonly determined by fluorescent protein tagging of live cells or mass spectrometry detection in subcellular purifications, but can also be predicted from amino acid sequence or protein expression patterns. The cropPAL database collates 556 published studies, from >300 research institutes in >30 countries that have been previously published, as well as compiling eight pre-computed subcellular predictions for all Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa and Zea mays protein sequences. The data collection including metadata for proteins and published studies can be accessed through a search portal http://crop-PAL.org. The subcellular localization information housed in cropPAL helps to depict plant cells as compartmentalized protein networks that can be investigated for improving crop yield and quality, and developing new biotechnological solutions to agricultural challenges.
26615150	Leaf proteome analysis provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of bentazon detoxification in rice.	2015	Pestic Biochem Physiol	Bentazon is a widely used herbicide that selectively removes broad-leaf weeds by competing with plastoquinone for the binding site in the D1 protein and interrupting the PET (photosynthetic electron transfer) chain. However, monocotyledonous plants, such as rice, show strong resistance to bentazon due to CYP81A6 induction, which results in herbicide detoxification. Here, we confirmed that rice was sensitive to bentazon treatment during the initial exposure period, in which bentazon rapidly inhibited photosynthesis efficiency and electron transfer, based on results of chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. In order to gain a comprehensive, pathway-oriented, mechanistic understanding of the effects directly induced by bentazon, we employed 2D-DIGE (two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) to analyze the leaf proteome after 8h of bentazon treatment coupled with individual protein identification by MALDI-TOF (Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) MS/MS. Proteomic analyses revealed that bentazon induced the relative upregulation or downregulation of 30 and 71 proteins (by 1.5-fold or more, p<0.05), respectively. The pathways involved include photosynthesis processes, carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant systems, and DNA stabilization and protein folding. Protein analysis data revealed that bentazon primarily suppressed photosynthesis processes, and showed inhibitory effects on carbohydrate metabolism and ATP synthesis, whereas several stress response proteins were induced in response to bentazon. Importantly, we identified a 519kD protein containing two histidine kinase-like ATPase domains and a C3HC4 RING type zinc finger domain which may function as a transcript factor to drive expression of detoxification genes such as CYP81A6, leading to bentazon tolerance. This study identifies, for the first time, a candidate transcription factor that could up-regulate CYP81A6 expression, and provides a foundation for further research to advance our knowledge of mechanisms of bentazon resistance in rice.
26581951	Enhancement of naphthalene tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the ferredoxin-like protein (ADI1) from rice.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The ADI1 Arabidopsis plants enhanced tolerance and degradation efficiency to naphthalene and had great potential for phytoremediation of naphthalene in the plant material before composting or harvesting and removal. Naphthalene is a global environmental concern, because this substance is assumed to contribute considerably to human cancer risk. Cleaning up naphthalene contamination in the environment is crucial. Phytoremediation is an efficient technology to clean up contaminants. However, no gene that can efficiently degrade exogenous recalcitrant naphthalene in plants has yet been discovered. Ferredoxin (Fd) is a key player of biological electron transfer reaction in the PAH degradation process. The biochemical pathway for bacterial degradation of naphthalene has been well investigated. In this study, a rice gene, ADI1, which codes for a putative photosynthetic-type Fd, has been transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants enhanced tolerance and degradation efficiency of naphthalene. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants assimilated naphthalene from the culture media faster and removed more of this substance. When taken together, our findings suggest that breeding plants with overexpressed ADI1 gene is an effective strategy to degrade naphthalene in the environment.
26640468	Systems Genetic Validation of the SNP-Metabolite Association in Rice Via Metabolite-Pathway-Based Phenome-Wide Association Scans.	2015	Front Plant Sci	In the post-GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Scan) era, the interpretation of GWAS results is crucial to screen for highly relevant phenotype-genotype association pairs. Based on the single genotype-phenotype association test and a pathway enrichment analysis, we propose a Metabolite-pathway-based Phenome-Wide Association Scan (M-PheWAS) to analyze the key metabolite-SNP pairs in rice and determine the regulatory relationship by assessing similarities in the changes of enzymes and downstream products in a pathway. Two SNPs, sf0315305925 and sf0315308337, were selected using this approach, and their molecular function and regulatory relationship with Enzyme EC:5.5.1.6 and with flavonoids, a significant downstream regulatory metabolite product, were demonstrated. Moreover, a total of 105 crucial SNPs were screened using M-PheWAS, which may be important for metabolite associations.
26336841	Enlightenment on the aequorin-based platform for screening Arabidopsis stress sensory channels related to calcium signaling.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	Free calcium ions (Ca(2+)) are an important signal molecule in response to a large array of external stimuli encountered by plants. Using the aequorin-based Ca(2+) recording system, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the Ca(2+) responses to biotic or abiotic stresses in dicotyledonous Arabidopsis. However, due to the lack of a similar detection system, little information has been obtained from the monocotyledonous rice (Oryza sativa). Recombinant aequorin has been introduced into rice, and the Ca(2+) responses to NaCl and H2O2 in rice roots were characterized. Although rice calcium signal sensor research has just started, the transgenic rice expressing aequorin provides a good platform to study rice adapted to different environmental conditions.
26643956	Endotoxin-neutralizing activity and mechanism of action of a cationic α-helical antimicrobial octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase of rice.	2016	Peptides	We have previously reported that AmyI-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase (AmyI-1) of rice, is a novel cationic α-helical peptide that exhibited antimicrobial activity against human pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans. In this study, to further investigate the potential functions of AmyI-1-18, we examined its inhibitory ability against the endotoxic activities of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs, smooth and Rc types) and lipid A from Escherichia coli. AmyI-1-18 inhibited the production of endotoxin-induced nitric oxide (NO), an inflammatory mediator, in mouse macrophages (RAW264) in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of a chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay illustrated that the ability [50% effective concentration (EC50): 0.17 μM] of AmyI-1-18 to neutralize lipid A was similar to its ability (EC50: 0.26 μM) to neutralize LPS, suggesting that AmyI-1-18 specifically binds to the lipid A moiety of LPS. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the interaction between AmyI-1-18 and LPS or lipid A also suggested that AmyI-1-18 directly binds to the lipid A moiety of LPS because the dissociation constant (KD) of AmyI-1-18 with lipid A is 5.6×10(-10) M, which is similar to that (4.3×10(-10) M) of AmyI-1-18 with LPS. In addition, AmyI-1-18 could block the binding of LPS-binding protein to LPS, although its ability was less than that of polymyxin B. These results suggest that AmyI-1-18 expressing antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing activities is useful as a safe and potent host defense peptide against pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria in many fields of healthcare.
26547398	Toxicological effects of bisphenol A on growth and antioxidant defense system in Oryza sativa as revealed by ultrastructure analysis.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of bisphenol A (BPA) on rice seedlings grown in a hydroponic system. The obtained results demonstrated that at lower concentration (up to 10µM) BPA had some stimulatory effects on the growth of rice seedlings but at higher doses it significantly inhibited seedlings growth. The photosynthetic pigments were significantly decreased by high doses of BPA. Exposure to BPA caused increased membrane permeability in root cells and resulted in increased concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased lipid peroxidation as revealed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. In leaves, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity exhibited an increase at lower concentrations of BPA but was inhibited at the highest dose (200µM) of BPA. At 100µM of BPA, a significant increase in antioxidant activities in leaves was observed but at 200µM this activity was inhibited. In roots, a significant decrease in enzymes activity was recorded at the highest concentration of BPA (200µM); however, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly increased at the concentrations of 10 and 50µM in comparison to the control. Moreover, the present results revealed that BPA severely affected cell organelles in rice seedlings. It can be concluded that the observed adverse effects in rice seedlings by BPA in the present study could be attributed to the oxidative stress caused by BPA.
26582432	Integrated pathway-based and network-based analysis of GC-MS rice metabolomics data under diazinon stress to infer affected biological pathways.	2016	Anal Biochem	Diazinon insecticide is widely applied in rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields in Iran. However, concerns are now being raised about its potential adverse impacts on rice. In this study, a time-course metabolic change in rice plants was investigated after diazinon treatment using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequently three different methods, MetaboAnalyst, MetaboNetwork, and analysis of reporter reactions, as a potential multivariate method were used to find the underlying changes in metabolism with stronger evidence in order to link differentially expressed metabolites to biological pathways. Results clearly showed the similarity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of rice plants to that of animals in terms of its inhibitability by diazinon and emphasized that subsequent accumulation of AChE mainly affects the metabolism of osmolites and tricarboxylic acid intermediates subsequent accumulation of ACh mainly affects the metabolism of osmolites and TCA intermediates.
26466878	Phylogenetic diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff), detection of polyketide synthase gene and their antagonistic activity analysis.	2015	Fungal Biol	The biodiversity of plant endophytic fungi is enormous, numerous competent endophytic fungi are capable of providing different forms of fitness benefits to host plants and also could produce a wide array of bioactive natural products, which make them a largely unexplored source of novel compounds with potential bioactivity. In this study, we provided a first insights into revealing the diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) from China using rDNA-ITS phylogenetic analysis. Here, the potential of fungi in producing bioactive natural products was estimated based on the beta-ketosynthase detected in the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster and on the bioassay of antagonistic activity against two rice phytopathogens Thanatephorus cucumeris and Xanthomonas oryzae. A total of 229 endophytic fungal strains were validated in 19 genera. Among the 24 representative strains, 13 strains displayedantagonistic activity against the phytopathogens. Furthermore, PKS genes were detected in 9 strains, indicating their potential for synthesising PKS compounds. Our study confirms the phylogenetic diversity of endophytic fungi in O. rufipogon G. and highlights that endophytic fungi are not only promising resources of biocontrol agents against phytopathogens of rice plants, but also of bioactive natural products and defensive secondary metabolites.
26581349	Safety assessment of lepidopteran insect-protected transgenic rice with cry2A* gene.	2016	Transgenic Res	Numerous genetically modified (GM) crops expressing proteins for insect resistance have been commercialized following extensive testing demonstrating that the foods obtained from them are as safe as that obtained from their corresponding non-GM varieties. In this paper, we report the outcome of safety studies conducted on a newly developed insect-resistant GM rice expressing the cry2A* gene by a subchronic oral toxicity study on rats. GM rice and non-GM rice were incorporated into the diet at levels of 30, 50, and 70% (w/w), No treatment-related adverse or toxic effects were observed based on an examination of the daily clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, hematology, serum biochemistry, and organ weight or based on gross and histopathological examination. These results demonstrate that the GM rice with cry2A* gene is as safe for food as conventional non-GM rice.
26576634	RNA-seq reveals differentially expressed genes of rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet in response to temperature interacting with nitrogen at meiosis stage.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important cereal crops, providing food for more than half of the world's population. However, grain yields are challenged by various abiotic stresses such as drought, fertilizer, heat, and their interaction. Rice at reproductive stage is much more sensitive to environmental temperatures, and little is known about molecular mechanisms of rice spikelet in response to high temperature interacting with nitrogen (N).

RESULTS: Here we reported the transcriptional profiling analysis of rice spikelet at meiosis stage using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as an attempt to gain insights into molecular events associated with temperature and nitrogen. This study received four treatments: 1) NN: normal nitrogen level (165 kg ha(-1)) with natural temperature (30 °C); 2) HH: high nitrogen level (330 kg ha(-1)) with high temperature (37 °C); 3) NH: normal nitrogen level and high temperature; and 4) HN: high nitrogen level and natural temperature, respectively. The de novo assembly generated 52,553,536 clean reads aligned with 72,667 unigenes. About 10 M reads were identified from each treatment. In these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we found 151 and 323 temperature-responsive DEGs in NN-vs-NH and HN-vs-HH, and 114 DEGs were co-expressed. Meanwhile, 203 and 144 nitrogen-responsive DEGs were focused in NN-vs-HN and NH-vs-HH, and 111 DEGs were co-expressed. The temperature-responsive genes were principally associated with calcium-dependent protein, cytochrome, flavonoid, heat shock protein, peroxidase, ubiquitin, and transcription factor while the nitrogen-responsive genes were mainly involved in glutamine synthetase, transcription factor, anthocyanin, amino acid transporter, leucine zipper protein, and hormone. It is noted that, rice spikelet fertility was significantly decreased under high temperature, but it was more reduced under higher nitrogen. Accordingly, numerous spikelet genes involved in pollen development, pollen tube growth, pollen germination, especially sporopollenin biosynthetic process, and pollen exine formation were mainly down-regulated under high temperature. Moreover, the expression levels of co-expressed DEGs including 5 sporopollenin biosynthetic process and 7 pollen exine formation genes of NN-vs-NH were lower than that of HN-vs-HH. Therefore, these spikelet genes may play important roles in response to high temperature with high nitrogen and may be good candidates for crop improvement.

CONCLUSIONS: This RNA-seq study will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of rice spikelet defense response to high temperature interacting with high nitrogen level.
26609814	Multiple abiotic stimuli are integrated in the regulation of rice gene expression under field conditions.	2015	Elife	Plants rely on transcriptional dynamics to respond to multiple climatic fluctuations and contexts in nature. We analyzed the genome-wide gene expression patterns of rice (Oryza sativa) growing in rainfed and irrigated fields during two distinct tropical seasons and determined simple linear models that relate transcriptomic variation to climatic fluctuations. These models combine multiple environmental parameters to account for patterns of expression in the field of co-expressed gene clusters. We examined the similarities of our environmental models between tropical and temperate field conditions, using previously published data. We found that field type and macroclimate had broad impacts on transcriptional responses to environmental fluctuations, especially for genes involved in photosynthesis and development. Nevertheless, variation in solar radiation and temperature at the timescale of hours had reproducible effects across environmental contexts. These results provide a basis for broad-based predictive modeling of plant gene expression in the field.
26640476	The Role of Ethylene in Plants Under Salinity Stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Although the roles of ethylene in plant response to salinity and other stresses have been extensively studied, there are still some obscure points left to be clarified. Generally, in Arabidopsis and many other terrestrial plants, ethylene signaling is indispensable for plant rapid response and tolerance to salinity stress. However, a few studies showed that functional knock-out of some ACSs increased plant salinity-tolerance, while overexpression of them caused more sensitivity. This seems to be contradictory to the known opinion that ethylene plays positive roles in salinity response. Differently, ethylene in rice may play negative roles in regulating seedling tolerance to salinity. The main positive ethylene signaling components MHZ7/OsEIN2, MHZ6/OsEIL1, and OsEIL2 all negatively regulate the salinity-tolerance of rice seedlings. Recently, several different research groups all proposed a negative feedback mechanism of coordinating plant growth and ethylene response, in which several ethylene-inducible proteins (including NtTCTP, NEIP2 in tobacco, AtSAUR76/77/78, and AtARGOS) act as inhibitors of ethylene response but activators of plant growth. Therefore, in addition to a summary of the general roles of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in salinity response, this review mainly focused on discussing (i) the discrepancies between ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in salinity response, (ii) the divergence between rice and Arabidopsis in regulation of salinity response by ethylene, and (iii) the possible negative feedback mechanism of coordinating plant growth and salinity response by ethylene.
26578239	Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice is the most important staple food for more than half of the human population, and blast disease is the most serious disease affecting global rice production. In this work, the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection. It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration. The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression. OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield. Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways. Altogether, our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.
26587748	Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of β-Hydroxy Acids from Malonic Acid.	2015	Org Lett	A nickel(II) catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of β-hydroxy acids from malonic acid and ketones was developed, revealing for the first time the synthetic utility of malonic acid in the construction of chiral carboxyl acids; importantly, the synthetic potential of this strategy was further demonstrated by the rapid construction of cephalanthrin A, phaitanthrin B, cruciferane, and rice metabolites.
26635754	Root Associated Bacillus sp. Improves Growth, Yield and Zinc Translocation for Basmati Rice (Oryza sativa) Varieties.	2015	Front Microbiol	Plant associated rhizobacteria prevailing in different agro-ecosystems exhibit multiple traits which could be utilized in various aspect of sustainable agriculture. Two hundred thirty four isolates were obtained from the roots of basmati-385 and basmati super rice varieties growing in clay loam and saline soil at different locations of Punjab (Pakistan). Out of 234 isolates, 27 were able to solubilize zinc (Zn) from different Zn ores like zinc phosphate [Zn3 (PO4)2], zinc carbonate (ZnCO3) and zinc oxide (ZnO). The strain SH-10 with maximum Zn solubilization zone of 24 mm on Zn3 (PO4)2ore and strain SH-17 with maximum Zn solubilization zone of 14-15 mm on ZnO and ZnCO3ores were selected for further studies. These two strains solubilized phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) in vitro with a solubilization zone of 38-46 mm and 47-55 mm respectively. The strains also suppressed economically important rice pathogens Pyricularia oryzae and Fusarium moniliforme by 22-29% and produced various biocontrol determinants in vitro. The strains enhanced Zn translocation toward grains and increased yield of basmati-385 and super basmati rice varieties by 22-49% and 18-47% respectively. The Zn solubilizing strains were identified as Bacillus sp. and Bacillus cereus by 16S rRNA gene analysis.
26618163	Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics Analysis of Rice Anther Proteins after Exposure to High Temperature.	2015	Int J Genomics	In rice, the stage of development most sensitive to high temperature stress is flowering, and exposure at this stage can result in spikelet sterility, thereby leading to significant yield losses. In this study, protein expression patterns of rice anthers from Dianxi4, a high temperature tolerant Japonica rice variety, were compared between samples exposed to high temperature and those grown in natural field conditions in Korea. Shotgun proteomics analysis of three replicate control and high-temperature-treated samples identified 3,266 nonredundant rice anther proteins (false discovery rate < 0.01). We found that high levels of ATP synthase, cupin domain-containing proteins, and pollen allergen proteins were present in rice anthers. Comparative analyses of 1,944 reproducibly expressed proteins identified 139 differentially expressed proteins, with 95 increased and 44 decreased in response to high temperature conditions. Heat shock, DnaK family, and chaperone proteins showed highly increased expression, suggesting that the high temperature tolerance of Dianxi4 is achieved by stabilization of proteins in pollen cells. Trehalose synthase was also highly increased after heat treatment, suggesting a possible role for trehalose in preventing protein denaturation through desiccation.
26624932	The fate of fusion Cry1Ab/1Ac proteins from Bt-transgenic rice in soil and water.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Toxin proteins form transgenic crops entering into the environment are likely affect non-target organisms. To investigate the entry route and fate of fusion Cry1Ab/1Ac proteins from transgenic rice expressing insecticide toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in soil and water, we conducted greenhouse and field experiments in 2013 and 2014. Cry1Ab/1Ac proteins from Bt-transgenic rice in soil was found within a horizontal range of 25cm, where most of plant roots distributed. Concentration of Cry1Ab/1Ac proteins was lower in water than in soil in the greenhouse experiment, and no Cry1Ab/1Ac protein was detected in field water. Cry1Ab/1Ac concentration from rice straws was higher in ditch water than in distilled water due to the existence of aquatic organisms in ditch water. Bt proteins from transgenic crops enter into soil ecosystems mainly through root exudates and into aquatic ecosystems through plant residues, which determines Bt fate in the environment.
26546318	ATTED-II in 2016: A Plant Coexpression Database Towards Lineage-Specific Coexpression.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	ATTED-II (http://atted.jp) is a coexpression database for plant species with parallel views of multiple coexpression data sets and network analysis tools. The user can efficiently find functional gene relationships and design experiments to identify gene functions by reverse genetics and general molecular biology techniques. Here, we report updates to ATTED-II (version 8.0), including new and updated coexpression data and analysis tools. ATTED-II now includes eight microarray- and six RNA sequencing-based coexpression data sets for seven dicot species (Arabidopsis, field mustard, soybean, barrel medick, poplar, tomato and grape) and two monocot species (rice and maize). Stand-alone coexpression analyses tend to have low reliability. Therefore, examining evolutionarily conserved coexpression is a more effective approach from the viewpoints of reliability and evolutionary importance. In contrast, the reliability of species-specific coexpression data remains poor. Our assessment scores for individual coexpression data sets indicated that the quality of the new coexpression data sets in ATTED-II is higher than for any previous coexpression data set. In addition, five species (Arabidopsis, soybean, tomato, rice and maize) in ATTED-II are now supported by both microarray- and RNA sequencing-based coexpression data, which has increased the reliability. Consequently, ATTED-II can now provide lineage-specific coexpression information. As an example of the use of ATTED-II to explore lineage-specific coexpression, we demonstrate monocot- and dicot-specific coexpression of cell wall genes. With the expanded coexpression data for multilevel evaluation, ATTED-II provides new opportunities to investigate lineage-specific evolution in plants.
26537003	Biochar-amended potting medium reduces the susceptibility of rice to root-knot nematode infections.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Biochar is a solid coproduct of biomass pyrolysis, and soil amended with biochar has been shown to enhance the productivity of various crops and induce systemic plant resistance to fungal pathogens. The aim of this study was to explore the ability of wood biochar to induce resistance to the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne graminicola in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) and examine its histochemical and molecular impact on plant defense mechanisms.

RESULTS: A 1.2 % concentration of biochar added to the potting medium of rice was found to be the most effective at reducing nematode development in rice roots, whereas direct toxic effects of biochar exudates on nematode viability, infectivity or development were not observed. The increased plant resistance was associated with biochar-primed H2O2 accumulation as well as with the transcriptional enhancement of genes involved in the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway. The increased susceptibility of the Ein2b-RNAi line, which is deficient in ET signaling, further confirmed that biochar-induced priming acts at least partly through ET signaling.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that biochar amendments protect rice plants challenged by nematodes. This priming effect partially depends on the ET signaling pathway and enhanced H2O2 accumulation.
26578693	TENOR: Database for Comprehensive mRNA-Seq Experiments in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Here we present TENOR (Transcriptome ENcyclopedia Of Rice, http://tenor.dna.affrc.go.jp), a database that encompasses large-scale mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data obtained from rice under a wide variety of conditions. Since the elucidation of the ability of plants to adapt to various growing conditions is a key issue in plant sciences, it is of great interest to understand the regulatory networks of genes responsible for environmental changes. We used mRNA-Seq and performed a time-course transcriptome analysis of rice, Oryza sativa L. (cv. Nipponbare), under 10 abiotic stress conditions (high salinity; high and low phosphate; high, low and extremely low cadmium; drought; osmotic; cold; and flood) and two plant hormone treatment conditions (ABA and jasmonic acid). A large number of genes that were responsive to abiotic stresses and plant hormones were detected by differential expression analysis. Furthermore, several responsive genes were found to encode transcription factors that could control the transcriptional network of stress responses, but the timing of the induction of these genes was not uniform across conditions. A significant number of cis-regulatory elements were enriched in the promoter regions of the responsive genes and were shared among conditions. These data suggest that some key components of gene regulation networks are shared between different stress signaling pathways. All the resources (novel genes identified from mRNA-Seq data, expression profiles, co-expressed genes and cis-regulatory elements) can be searched for and are available in TENOR.
26573512	Differential expression profiling of the early response to Ustilaginoidea virens between false smut resistant and susceptible rice varieties.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens has recently become one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. Breeding and deployment of resistant varieties is considered as the most effective strategy to control this disease. However, little is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying rice resistance against U. virens.

RESULTS: To explore genetic basis of rice resistance to U. virens, differential expression profiles in resistant 'IR28' and susceptible 'LYP9' cultivars during early stages of U. virens infection were compared using RNA-Seq data. The analyses revealed that 748 genes were up-regulated only in the resistant variety and 438 genes showed opposite expression patterns between the two genotypes. The genes encoding receptor-like kinases and cytoplasmic kinases were highly enriched in this pool of oppositely expressed genes. Many pathogenesis-related (PR) and diterpene phytoalexin biosynthetic genes were specifically induced in the resistant variety. Interestingly, the RY repeat motif was significantly more abundant in the 5'-regulatory regions of these differentially regulated PR genes. Several WRKY transcription factors were also differentially regulated in the two genotypes, which is consistent with our finding that the cis-regulatory W-boxes were abundant in the promoter regions of up-regulated genes in IR28. Furthermore, U. virens genes that are relevant to fungal reproduction and pathogenicity were found to be suppressed in the resistant cultivar.

CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that rice resistance to false smut may be attributable to plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, activation of resistance signaling pathways, induced production of PR proteins and diterpene phytoalexins, and suppression of pathogenicity genes in U. virens as well.
26587012	A quantitative shotgun proteomics analysis of germinated rice embryos and coleoptiles under low-temperature conditions.	2015	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: At low temperatures, rice grains have a reduced germination rate and grow more slowly, which delays the emergence of rice seedlings from the paddy water surface and significantly increases seedling mortality. In this study, we conducted a shotgun proteomics analysis of geminated embryos and coleoptiles to compare the proteome expression pattern between the low-temperature resistant variety, Tong 88-7, and the low-temperature susceptible variety, Milyang 23.

RESULTS: In a shotgun proteomics analysis of low-temperature resistant and susceptible embryos and coleoptiles in both cold and control temperatures, we discovered a total of 2626 non-redundant proteins, with a 0.01 false discovery rate. A comparison of protein expression patterns between resistant and susceptible embryos and coleoptiles under low-temperature and normal conditions revealed that 85 proteins and 196 proteins were expressed by the resistant and susceptible strains, respectively, in response to low temperature. Among them, 12 proteins overlapped. Proteins involved in stress responses, metabolism, and gene expression were expressed in both strains.

CONCLUSIONS: Similar molecular functions of the response were detected, suggesting that the resistant and susceptible strain have a similar proteome response to cold temperatures. The resistance of Tong 88-7 to cold-water germination may result from the efficiency of these proteins, rather than activation of additional or different molecular processes. A comparison of protein expression between the resistant and susceptible strains' responses revealed that the more successful low-temperature germination of Tong 88-7 was associated with gibberellin signaling, protein trafficking, and the ABA-mediated stress response.
26525061	Cytokinin: a key driver of seed yield.	2016	J Exp Bot	The cytokinins have been implicated in many facets of plant growth and development including cell division and differentiation, shoot and root growth, apical dominance, senescence, fruit and seed development, and the response to biotic and abiotic stressors. Cytokinin levels are regulated by a balance between biosynthesis [isopentenyl transferase (IPT)], activation [Lonely Guy (LOG)], inactivation (O-glucosyl transferase), re-activation (β-glucosidase), and degradation [cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX)]. During senescence, the levels of active cytokinins decrease, with premature senescence leading to a decrease in yield. During the early stages of fruit and seed development, cytokinin levels are transiently elevated, and coincide with nuclear and cell divisions which are a determinant of final seed size. Exogenous application of cytokinin, ectopic expression of IPT, or down-regulation of CKX have, on occasions, led to increased seed yield, leading to the suggestion that cytokinin may be limiting yield. However, manipulation of cytokinins is complex, not only because of their pleiotropic nature but also because the genes coding for biosynthesis and metabolism belong to multigene families, the members of which are themselves spatially and temporally differentiated. Previous research on yield of rice showed that plant breeders could directly target the cytokinins. Modern genome editing tools could be employed to target and manipulate cytokinin levels to increase seed yield with the concurrent aim of maintaining quality. However, how the cytokinin level is modified and whether IPT or CKX is targeted may depend on whether the plant is considered to be in a source-limiting environment or to be sink limited.
26603141	Serotonin attenuates biotic stress and leads to lesion browning caused by a hypersensitive response to Magnaporthe oryzae penetration in rice.	2016	Plant J	The hypersensitive response (HR) of plants is one of the earliest responses to prevent pathogen invasion. A brown dot lesion on a leaf is visual evidence of the HR against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice, but tracking the browning process has been difficult. In this study, we induced the HR in rice cultivars harboring the blast resistance gene Pit by inoculation of an incompatible M. oryzae strain, which generated a unique resistance lesion with a brown ring (halo) around the brown fungal penetration site. Inoculation analysis using a plant harboring Pit but lacking an enzyme that catalyzes tryptamine to serotonin showed that high accumulation of the oxidized form of serotonin was the cause of the browning at the halo and penetration site. Our analysis of the halo browning process in the rice leaf revealed that abscisic acid enhanced biosynthesis of serotonin under light conditions, and serotonin changed to the oxidized form via hydrogen peroxide produced by light. The dramatic increase in serotonin, which has a high antioxidant activity, suppressed leaf damage outside the halo, blocked expansion of the browning area and attenuated inhibition of plant growth. These results suggest that serotonin helps to reduce biotic stress in the plant by acting as a scavenger of oxygen radicals to protect uninfected tissues from oxidative damage caused by the HR. The deposition of its oxide at the HR lesion is observed as lesion browning.
26452831	Stable isotope labeling assisted liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for quantitative analysis of endogenous gibberellins.	2015	Talanta	In the current study, we developed a stable isotope labeling strategy for the absolute quantification of gibberellins (GAs) by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). N,N-dimethyl ethylenediamine (DMED) and its deuterated counterpart d(4)-DMED were used to derivatize GAs extracted from plant tissue samples and GA standards respectively. The both derivatives of GAs were mixed and then subjected to HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The absolute quantification of GAs in plant tissues could be achieved by calculating the peak area ratios of DMED labeled GAs/d(4)-DMED labeled GAs. In the proposed strategy, the derivatization reaction of the labeling reagents with GAs could be completed rapidly (within 5 min) with high efficiency (>99%) under mild conditions. The resulting derivatives could produce specific fragments in collision induced dissociation (CID), leading to high selectivity in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, thus enhanced the reliability of the LC-MS/MS method. Furthermore, the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of GAs were considerably decreased (2-32 folds) due to incorporating easily ionized moieties into GAs, and the quantification of GAs in plant tissue could be achieved without isotopically labeled GA standards. Good linearity was obtained with correlation coefficients R(2) values of >0.99. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0.02 to 0.74 pg and 0.07 to 2.45 pg, respectively. Eleven GAs could be successfully determined in spiked sample with 72-128% recoveries and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were between 1.0% and 13.9%. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied for the detection of GAs in 50mg (fresh weight) Oryza sativa leaves.
26617618	JAZ Repressors: Potential Involvement in Nutrients Deficiency Response in Rice and Chickpea.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Jasmonates (JA) are well-known phytohormones which play important roles in plant development and defense against pathogens. Jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins are plant-specific proteins and act as transcriptional repressors of JA-responsive genes. JA regulates both biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants; however, its role in nutrient deficiency responses is very elusive. Although, JA is well-known for root growth inhibition, little is known about behavior of JAZ genes in response to nutrient deficiencies, under which root architectural alteration is an important adaptation. Using protein sequence homology and a conserved-domains approach, here we identify 10 novel JAZ genes from the recently sequenced Chickpea genome, which is one of the most nutrient efficient crops. Both rice and chickpea JAZ genes express in tissue- and stimuli-specific manners. Many of which are preferentially expressed in root. Our analysis further showed differential expression of JAZ genes under macro (NPK) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe) deficiency in rice and chickpea roots. While both rice and chickpea JAZ genes showed a certain level of specificity toward type of nutrient deficiency, generally majority of them showed induction under K deficiency. Generally, JAZ genes showed an induction at early stages of stress and expression declined at later stages of macro-nutrient deficiency. Our results suggest that JAZ genes might play a role in early nutrient deficiency response both in monocot and dicot roots, and information generated here can be further used for understanding the possible roles of JA in root architectural alterations for nutrient deficiency adaptations.
26546731	Exploration of rice pistil responses during early post-pollination through a combined proteomic and transcriptomic analysis.	2016	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Pollen-stigma interaction is a multi-step and complex physiological process which contains different signaling and biochemical pathways. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this process in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, the changes of gene expression were investigated through a combination study of transcriptome and proteome profiles in rice pistil during pollination. Totally, 1117 differentially expressed genes were identified, among which 962 and 167 were detected at transcriptional and protein level respectively. Functional categorization analysis showed that the genes involved in central metabolism were up-regulated, which can lead to the enhancement of these metabolisms. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) were over-accumulated in the stigma. In response to this, the proteins or transcripts involved in redox homeostasis regulation were differentially expressed. Furthermore, significant changes of protein ubiquitination and its related genes or proteins, especially some E3 ligases encoding genes, indicate that protein ubiquitination might play important roles in cell signal transduction during the pollination process. Our study sheds some lights on gene and protein expression profiles of rice pistil pollination process, and gives us a comprehensive understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms controlling pollination in rice.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Using RNA-seq, 2-DE and iTRAQ assays, we have generated the large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic data containing abundant information on genes involved in pollen and pistil interaction. Our results showed that ROS were significantly accumulated in stigma after pollination, and the abundance of genes involve in redox homeostasis system were changed variously. We also show that, changes of some E3 ligases encoding genes might indicate that protein ubiquitination play important roles in cell signal transduction during the pollination process. Data in this study might be helpful to deeply understand the pollination in rice.
26360816	Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveal extensive phosphorylation of regulatory proteins in developing rice anthers.	2015	Plant J	Anther development, particularly around the time of meiosis, is extremely crucial for plant sexual reproduction. Meanwhile, cell-to-cell communication between somatic (especial tapetum) cells and meiocytes are important for both somatic anther development and meiosis. To investigate possible molecular mechanisms modulating protein activities during anther development, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses for developing rice (Oryza sativa) anthers around the time of meiosis (RAM). In total, we identified 4984 proteins and 3203 phosphoproteins with 8973 unique phosphorylation sites (p-sites). Among those detected here, 1544 phosphoproteins are currently absent in the Plant Protein Phosphorylation DataBase (P3 DB), substantially enriching plant phosphorylation information. Mapman enrichment analysis showed that 'DNA repair','transcription regulation' and 'signaling' related proteins were overrepresented in the phosphorylated proteins. Ten genetically identified rice meiotic proteins were detected to be phosphorylated at a total of 25 p-sites; moreover more than 400 meiotically expressed proteins were revealed to be phosphorylated and their phosphorylation sites were precisely assigned. 163 putative secretory proteins, possibly functioning in cell-to-cell communication, are also phosphorylated. Furthermore, we showed that DNA synthesis, RNA splicing and RNA-directed DNA methylation pathways are extensively affected by phosphorylation. In addition, our data support 46 kinase-substrate pairs predicted by the rice Kinase-Protein Interaction Map, with SnRK1 substrates highly enriched. Taken together, our data revealed extensive protein phosphorylation during anther development, suggesting an important post-translational modification affecting protein activity.
26445326	Transmembrane START domain proteins: in silico identification, characterization and expression analysis under stress conditions in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.).	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Steroidogenic acute regulatory related transfer (StART) proteins that are involved in transport of lipid molecules, play a myriad of functions in insects, mammals and plants. These proteins consist of a modular START domain of approximately 200 amino acids which binds and transfers the lipids. In the present study we have performed a genome-wide search for all START domain proteins in chickpea. The search identified 36 chickpea genes belonging to the START domain family. Through a phylogenetic tree reconstructed with Arabidopsis, rice, chickpea, and soybean START proteins, we were able to identify four transmembrane START (TM-START) proteins in chickpea. These four proteins are homologous to the highly conserved mammalian phosphatidylcholine transfer proteins. Multiple sequence alignment of all the transmembrane containing START proteins from Arabidopsis, rice, chickpea, and soybean revealed that the amino acid residues to which phosphatidylcholine binds in mammals, is also conserved in all these plant species, implying an important functional role and a very similar mode of action of all these proteins across dicots and monocots. This study characterizes a few of the not so well studied transmembrane START superfamily genes that may be involved in stress signaling. Expression analysis in various tissues showed that these genes are predominantly expressed in flowers and roots of chickpea. Three of the chickpea TM-START genes showed induced expression in response to drought, salt, wound and heat stress, suggesting their role in stress response.
26472068	Live-cell imaging of rice cytological changes reveals the importance of host vacuole maintenance for biotrophic invasion by blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.	2015	Microbiologyopen	The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae grows inside living host cells. Cytological analyses by live-cell imaging have revealed characteristics of the biotrophic invasion, particularly the extrainvasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) originating from the host plasma membrane and a host membrane-rich structure, biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). Here, we observed rice subcellular changes associated with invasive hyphal growth using various transformants expressing specifically localized fluorescent proteins. The invasive hyphae did not penetrate across but were surrounded by the host vacuolar membrane together with EIHM even after branching. High-resolution imaging of BICs revealed that the host cytosol was accumulated at BIC with aggregated EIHM and a symplastic effector, Pwl2, in a punctate form. The vacuolar membrane did not aggregate in but closely surrounded the BIC. A good correlation was observed between the early collapse of vacuoles and damage of invasive hyphae in the first-invaded cell. Furthermore, a newly developed, long-term imaging method has revealed that the central vacuole gradually shrank until collapse, which was caused by the hyphal invasion occurring earlier in the neighboring cells than in the first-invaded cells. These data suggest that M. oryzae may suppress host vacuole collapse during early infection stages for successful infection.
26453434	The Rice Transcription Factor WRKY53 Suppresses Herbivore-Induced Defenses by Acting as a Negative Feedback Modulator of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Activity.	2015	Plant Physiol	The mechanisms by which herbivore-attacked plants activate their defenses are well studied. By contrast, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that allow them to control their defensive investment and avoid a defensive overshoot. We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY gene, OsWRKY53, whose expression is rapidly induced upon wounding and induced in a delayed fashion upon attack by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis. The transcript levels of OsWRKY53 are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases OsMPK3/OsMPK6. OsWRKY53 physically interacts with OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and suppresses their activity in vitro. By consequence, it modulates the expression of defensive, MPK-regulated WRKYs and thereby reduces jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-isoleucine, and ethylene induction. This phytohormonal reconfiguration is associated with a reduction in trypsin protease inhibitor activity and improved SSB performance. OsWRKY53 is also shown to be a negative regulator of plant growth. Taken together, these results show that OsWRKY53 functions as a negative feedback modulator of MPK3/MPK6 and thereby acts as an early suppressor of induced defenses. OsWRKY53 therefore enables rice plants to control the magnitude of their defensive investment during early signaling.
26541262	Robust method for the analysis of phytochelatins in rice by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry based on polymeric column materials.	2015	J Sep Sci	A sensitive and robust high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method for the identification and quantification of glutathione and phytochelatins from rice was developed. Homogenized samples were extracted with water containing 100 mM dithiothreitol, and solid-phase extraction using polymer anion exchange resin was employed for sample purification. Chromatography was performed on a polymeric column with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase at the flow rate of 300 μL/min. The limit of quantitation was 6-100 nM. This assay showed excellent linearity for both glutathione and phytochelatins over physiological normal ranges, with correlation coefficients (r) > 0.9976. Recoveries for four biothiols were within the range of 76-118%, within relative standard deviations less than 15%. The intraday precision (n = 7) was 2.1-13.3%, and the interday precision over 15 days was 4.3-15.2%. The optimized method was applied to analyze tissue samples from rice grown using nutrient solutions with three different cadmium concentrations (0, 50, and 100 μM). With increasing cadmium concentrations, the content of phytochelatin 2 and phytochelatin 3 in rice roots increased, in contrast to most phytochelatins, and the content of glutathione in rice stems and roots decreased significantly.
26484897	Cloning and functional characterization of the Arabidopsis N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase responsible for melatonin synthesis.	2016	J Pineal Res	The N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) gene encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin as the last step in melatonin biosynthesis. The first plant ASMT gene to be cloned was from rice. An orthologous gene encoding a protein with ASMT activity and only 39.7% amino acid sequence identity to the rice ASMT protein was recently isolated from apple (Malus zumi). The low homology of the apple ASMT sequence prompted us to screen the Arabidopsis genome for a homologous ASMT gene. The At4g35160 gene exhibited the highest sequence identity (31%) to the rice ASMT gene, followed by the At1g76790 gene with 29% sequence identity. We purified recombinant proteins expressed from the two Arabidopsis genes. The At4g35160 recombinant protein exhibited ASMT enzyme activity, but the At1g76790 recombinant protein did not; thus, we designated At4g35160 as an Arabidopsis thaliana ASMT (AtASMT) gene. The AtASMT protein catalyzed the conversion of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin and serotonin to 5-methoxytryptamine with Vmax values of 0.11 and 0.29 pkat/mg protein, respectively. However, AtASMT exhibited no caffeic acid O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that its function was highly specific to melatonin synthesis. AtASMT transcripts were induced by cadmium treatment in Arabidopsis followed by increased melatonin synthesis. Similar to other ASMT proteins, AtASMT was localized in the cytoplasm and its ectopic overexpression in rice resulted in increased ASMT enzyme activity and melatonin production, indicating the involvement of AtASMT in melatonin synthesis.
26465130	Generation of insect-resistant and glyphosate-tolerant rice by introduction of a T-DNA containing two Bt insecticidal genes and an EPSPS gene.	2015	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance have been two of the most important traits in the genetic improvement of various crops. In this study, two Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal genes, Cry1Ac and Cry1Ig, and a modified glyphosate-tolerant 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene (G10) were combined into a single transferred DNA (T-DNA) fragment and introduced into rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A transgenic line with single-copy T-DNA insertion named GAI-14 was found to be highly resistant to striped stem borer and rice leaf roller, and tolerant to glyphosate. Analysis of T-DNA border sequence suggested that the transgenes were inserted at the chromosome 3 and appeared to have not interrupted any known or putative genes. A field trial observed no significant difference in the basic agronomic traits between GAI-14 and the recipient rice.
26461930	Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce odd chain-length fatty alcohols.	2016	Biotechnol Bioeng	Fatty aldehydes and alcohols are valuable precursors used in the industrial manufacturing of a myriad of specialty products. Herein, we demonstrate the de novo production of odd chain-length fatty aldehydes and fatty alcohols in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing a novel biosynthetic pathway involving cytosolic thioesterase, rice α-dioxygenase and endogenous aldehyde reductases. We attained production titers of ∼20 mg/l fatty aldehydes and ∼20 mg/l fatty alcohols in shake flask cultures after 48 and 60 h respectively without extensive fine-tuning of metabolic fluxes. In contrast to prior studies which relied on bi-functional fatty acyl-CoA reductase to produce even chain-length fatty alcohols, our biosynthetic route exploits α-oxidation reaction to produce odd chain-length fatty aldehyde intermediates without using NAD(P)H cofactor, thereby conserving cellular resource during the overall synthesis of odd chain-length fatty alcohols. The biosynthetic pathway presented in this study has the potential to enable sustainable and efficient synthesis of fatty acid-derived chemicals from processed biomass.
26448265	Development of disease-resistant rice by pathogen-responsive expression of WRKY45.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	WRKY45 is an important transcription factor in the salicylic acid signalling pathway in rice that mediates chemical-induced resistance against multiple pathogens. Its constitutive overexpression confers extremely strong resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae to rice, but has adverse effects on agronomic traits. Here, a new strategy to confer rice with strong disease resistance without any negative effects on agronomic traits was established by expressing WRKY45 under the control of pathogen-responsive promoters in combination with a translational enhancer derived from a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of rice alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Rice promoters that responded to M. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae infections within 24 h were identified, and 2-kb upstream sequences from nine of them were isolated, fused to WRKY45 cDNA with or without the ADH 5'-UTR, and introduced into rice. Although pathogen-responsive promoters alone failed to confer effective disease resistance, the use of the ADH 5'-UTR in combination with them, in particular the PR1b and GST promoters, enhanced disease resistance. Field trials showed that overall, PR1b promoter-driven (with ADH 5'-UTR) lines performed the best and one had agronomic traits comparable to control untransformed rice. Thus, expressing WRKY45 under the control of the PR1b promoter with the ADH 5'-UTR is an excellent strategy to develop disease-resistant rice, and the line established could serve as a mother line for breeding disease-resistant rice.
26503135	The strigolactone biosynthesis gene DWARF27 is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Strigolactones are a class of plant hormones whose biosynthesis is activated in response to phosphate starvation. This involves several enzymes, including the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 7 (CCD7) and CCD8 and the carotenoid isomerase DWARF27 (D27). D27 expression is known to be responsive to phosphate starvation. In Medicago truncatula and rice (Oryza sativa) this transcriptional response requires the GRAS-type proteins NSP1 and NSP2; both proteins are essential for rhizobium induced root nodule formation in legumes. In line with this, we questioned whether MtNSP1-MtNSP2 dependent MtD27 regulation is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis.

RESULTS: We provide evidence that MtD27 is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis in M. truncatula roots upon phosphate stress. Spatiotemporal expression studies revealed that this gene is also highly expressed in nodule primordia and subsequently becomes restricted to the meristem and distal infection zone of a mature nodules. A similar expression pattern was found for MtCCD7 and MtCCD8. Rhizobium lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) application experiments revealed that of these genes MtD27 is most responsive in an MtNSP1 and MtNSP2 dependent manner. Symbiotic expression of MtD27 requires components of the symbiosis signaling pathway; including MtDMI1, MtDMI2, MtDMI3/MtCCaMK and in part MtERN1. This in contrast to MtD27 expression upon phosphate starvation, which only requires MtNSP1 and MtNSP2.

CONCLUSION: Our data show that the phosphate-starvation responsive strigolactone biosynthesis gene MtD27 is also rapidly induced by rhizobium LCO signals in an MtNSP1 and MtNSP2-dependent manner. Additionally, we show that MtD27 is co-expressed with MtCCD7 and MtCCD8 in nodule primordia and in the infection zone of mature nodules.
26519289	Influence of Multi-Gene Allele Combinations on Grain Size of Rice and Development of a Regression Equation Model to Predict Grain Parameters.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Grain size is one of the key factors determining yield and quality in rice. A large number of genes are involved in the regulation of grain size parameters such as grain length and grain width. Different alleles of these genes have different impacts on the grain size traits under their control. However, the combined influence of multiple alleles of different genes on grain size remains to be investigated. Six key genes known to influence grain size were investigated in this study: GS3, GS5, GS6, GW2, qSW5/GW5, and GW8/OsSPL16. Allele and grain measurement data were used to develop a regression equation model that can be used for molecular breeding of rice with desired grain characteristics.

RESULTS: A total of 215 diverse rice germplasms, which originated from or were developed in 28 rice-consuming countries, were used in this study. Genotyping analysis demonstrated that a relatively small number of allele combinations were preserved in the diverse population and that these allele combinations were significantly associated with differences in grain size. Furthermore, in several cases, variation at a single gene was sufficient to influence grain size, even when the alleles of other genes remained constant. The data were used to develop a regression equation model for prediction of rice grain size, and this was tested using data from a further 34 germplasms. The model was significantly correlated with three of the four grain size-related traits examined in this study.

CONCLUSION: Rice grain size is strongly influenced by specific combinations of alleles from six different genes. A regression equation model developed from allele and grain measurement data can be used in rice breeding programs for the development of new rice varieties with desired grain size and shape.
26398795	Production of dammarane-type sapogenins in rice by expressing the dammarenediol-II synthase gene from Panax ginseng C.A. Mey.	2015	Plant Sci	Ginsenosides are the main active ingredients in Chinese medicinal ginseng; 2,3-oxidosqualene is a precursor metabolite to ginsenosides that is present in rice. Because rice lacks a key rate-limiting enzyme (dammarenediol-II synthase, DS), rice cannot synthesize dammarane-type ginsenosides. In this study, the ginseng (Panax ginseng CA Mey.) DS gene (GenBank: AB265170.1) was transformed into rice using agrobacterium, and 64 rice transgenic plants were produced. The Transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertion sites in homozygous lines of the T2 generation were determined by using high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (hiTAIL-PCR) and differed in all tested lines. One to two copies of the T-DNA were present in each transformant, and real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that the transformed DS gene could be transcribed and highly expressed. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the dammarane-type sapogenin 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) content was 0.35-0.59 mg/g dw and the dammarane-type sapogenin 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) content was 0.23-0.43 mg/g dw in the transgenic rice. LC/MS analysis confirmed production of PPD and PPT. These results indicate that a new "ginseng rice" germplasm containing dammarane-type sapogenins has been successfully developed by transforming the ginseng DS gene into rice.
26697384	Early changes in shoot transcriptome of rice in response to Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1.	2015	Genom Data	Yeasts of Rhodotorula genus have been reported to show endophytic colonization in different plants. Some of the Rhodotorula species are found to exhibit plant growth promoting activities and also have been reported to protect plants against invading pathogens. A yeast strain closely related to Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was isolated from the endosphere of Typha angustifolia collected from a Uranium mine. A microarray analysis was performed to investigate the early changes in rice shoot transcripts in response to this yeast (R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1). Transcriptional changes were monitored in 6 h and 24 h treated rice plant shoots as compared to 0 h control. The microarray data has been submitted to the NCBI GEO repository under the accession number of GSE64321.
26459328	Core cell cycle regulatory genes in rice and their expression profiles across the growth zone of the leaf.	2015	J Plant Res	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) as a model and crop plant with a sequenced genome offers an outstanding experimental system for discovering and functionally analyzing the major cell cycle control elements in a cereal species. In this study, we identified the core cell cycle genes in the rice genome through a hidden Markov model search and multiple alignments supported with the use of short protein sequence probes. In total we present 55 rice putative cell cycle genes with locus identity, chromosomal location, approximate chromosome position and EST accession number. These cell cycle genes include nine cyclin dependent-kinase (CDK) genes, 27 cyclin genes, one CKS gene, two RBR genes, nine E2F/DP/DEL genes, six KRP genes, and one WEE gene. We also provide characteristic protein sequence signatures encoded by CDK and cyclin gene variants. Promoter analysis by the FootPrinter program discovered several motifs in the regulatory region of the core cell cycle genes. As a first step towards functional characterization we performed transcript analysis by RT-PCR to determine gene specific variation in transcript levels along the rice leaves. The meristematic zone of the leaves where cells are actively dividing was identified based on kinematic analysis and flow cytometry. As expected, expression of the majority of cell cycle genes was exclusively associated with the meristematic region. However genes such as different D-type cyclins, DEL1, KRP1/3, and RBR2 were also expressed in leaf segments representing the transition zone in which cells start differentiation.
26473328	Amelioration of arsenic toxicity in rice: Comparative effect of inoculation of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis sp. on growth, biochemical changes and arsenic uptake.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The present study was conducted to assess the responses of rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Triguna) by inoculating alga; Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochlropsis sp. supplemented with As(III) (50µM) under hydroponics condition. Results showed that reduced growth variables and protein content in rice plant caused by As toxicity were restored in the algae inoculated plants after 7d of treatment. The rice plant inoculated with Nannochloropsis sp. exhibited a better response in terms of increased root, shoot length and biomass than C. vulgaris under As(III) treatment. A significant reduction in cellular toxicity (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD, APX and GR) activities were observed in algae inoculated rice plant under As(III) treatment in comparison to uninoculated rice. In addition, rice treated with As(III), accumulated 35.05mgkg(-1)dw arsenic in the root and 29.96mgkg(-1)dw in the shoot. However, lower accumulation was observed in As(III) treated rice inoculated with C. vulgaris (24.09mg kg(-1)dw) and Nannochloropsis sp. (20.66mgkg(-1)dw) in the roots, while in shoot, it was 20.10mgkg(-1)dw and 11.67mgkg(-1)dw, respectively. Results demonstrated that application of these algal inoculum ameliorates toxicity and improved tolerance in rice through reduced As uptake and modulating antioxidant enzymes. Thus, application of algae could provide a low-cost and eco-friendly mitigation approach to reduce accumulation of arsenic in edible part of rice as well as higher yield in the As contaminated agricultural field.
26519466	Information Commons for Rice (IC4R).	2016	Nucleic Acids Res	Rice is the most important staple food for a large part of the world's human population and also a key model organism for plant research. Here, we present Information Commons for Rice (IC4R; http://ic4r.org), a rice knowledgebase featuring adoption of an extensible and sustainable architecture that integrates multiple omics data through community-contributed modules. Each module is developed and maintained by different committed groups, deals with data collection, processing and visualization, and delivers data on-demand via web services. In the current version, IC4R incorporates a variety of rice data through multiple committed modules, including genome-wide expression profiles derived entirely from RNA-Seq data, resequencing-based genomic variations obtained from re-sequencing data of thousands of rice varieties, plant homologous genes covering multiple diverse plant species, post-translational modifications, rice-related literatures and gene annotations contributed by the rice research community. Unlike extant related databases, IC4R is designed for scalability and sustainability and thus also features collaborative integration of rice data and low costs for database update and maintenance. Future directions of IC4R include incorporation of other omics data and association of multiple omics data with agronomically important traits, dedicating to build IC4R into a valuable knowledgebase for both basic and translational researches in rice.
26493518	Functional Characterization of PhapLEAFY, a FLORICAULA/LEAFY Ortholog in Phalaenopsis aphrodite.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The plant-specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is considered to be a master regulator of flower development in the model plant, Arabidopsis. This protein plays a dual role in plant growth, integrating signals from the floral inductive pathways and acting as a floral meristem identity gene by activating genes for floral organ development. Although LFY occupies an important position in flower development, the functional divergence of LFY homologs has been demonstrated in several plants including monocots and gymnosperms. In particular, the functional roles of LFY genes from orchid species such as Phalaenopsis that contain unique floral morphologies with distinct expression patterns of floral organ identity genes remain elusive. Here, PhapLFY, an ortholog of Arabidopsis LFY from Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana, a Taiwanese native monopodial orchid, was isolated and characterized through analyses of expression and protein activity. PhapLFY transcripts accumulated in the floral primordia of developing inflorescences, and the PhapLFY protein had transcriptional autoactivation activity forming as a homodimer. Furthermore, PhapLFY rescues the aberrant floral phenotypes of Arabidopsis lfy mutants. Overexpression of PhapLFY alone or together with PhapFT1, a P. aphrodite subsp. formosana homolog of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in rice, caused precocious heading. Consistently, a higher Chl content in the sepals and morphological changes in epidermal cells were observed in the floral organs of PhapLFY knock-down orchids generated by virus-induced gene silencing. Taken together, these results suggest that PhapLFY is functionally distinct from RICE FLORICAULA/LEAFY (RFL) but similar to Arabidopsis LFY based on phenotypes of our transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants.
26523085	A Century of Gibberellin Research.	2015	J Plant Growth Regul	Gibberellin research has its origins in Japan in the 19th century, when a disease of rice was shown to be due to a fungal infection. The symptoms of the disease including overgrowth of the seedling and sterility were later shown to be due to secretions of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi (now reclassified as Fusarium fujikuroi), from which the name gibberellin was derived for the active component. The profound effect of gibberellins on plant growth and development, particularly growth recovery in dwarf mutants and induction of bolting and flowering in some rosette species, prompted speculation that these fungal metabolites were endogenous plant growth regulators and this was confirmed by chemical characterisation in the late 1950s. Gibberellins are now known to be present in vascular plants, and some fungal and bacterial species. The biosynthesis of gibberellins in plants and the fungus has been largely resolved in terms of the pathways, enzymes, genes and their regulation. The proposal that gibberellins act in plants by removing growth limitation was confirmed by the demonstration that they induce the degradation of the growth-inhibiting DELLA proteins. The mechanism by which this is achieved was clarified by the identification of the gibberellin receptor from rice in 2005. Current research on gibberellin action is focussed particularly on the function of DELLA proteins as regulators of gene expression. This review traces the history of gibberellin research with emphasis on the early discoveries that enabled the more recent advances in this field.
26512055	An A20/AN1-type zinc finger protein modulates gibberellins and abscisic acid contents and increases sensitivity to abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Exp Bot	The plant hormones gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles in plant development and stress responses. Here we report a novel A20/AN1-type zinc finger protein ZFP185 involved in GA and ABA signaling in the regulation of growth and stress response. ZFP185 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues. Overexpression of ZFP185 in rice results in a semi-dwarfism phenotype, reduced cell size, and the decrease of endogenous GA3 content. By contrast, higher GA3 content was observed in RNAi plants. The application of exogenous GA3 can fully rescue the semi-dwarfism phenotype of ZFP185 overexpressing plants, suggesting the negative role of ZFP185 in GA biosynthesis. Besides GA, overexpression of ZFP185 decreased ABA content and expression of several ABA biosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, it was found that ZFP185, unlike previously known A20/AN1-type zinc finger genes, increases sensitivity to drought, cold, and salt stresses, implying the negative role of ZFP185 in stress tolerance. ZFP185 was localized in the cytoplasm and lacked transcriptional activation potential. Our study suggests that ZFP185 regulates plant growth and stress responses by affecting GA and ABA biosynthesis in rice.
26471894	Plastidial Disproportionating Enzyme Participates in Starch Synthesis in Rice Endosperm by Transferring Maltooligosyl Groups from Amylose and Amylopectin to Amylopectin.	2015	Plant Physiol	Plastidial disproportionating enzyme1 (DPE1), an α-1,4-d-glucanotransferase, has been thought to be involved in storage starch synthesis in cereal crops. However, the precise function of DPE1 remains to be established. We present here the functional identification of DPE1 in storage starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) by endosperm-specific gene overexpression and suppression. DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules. Chains with degree of polymerization (DP) of 6 to 10 and 23 to 38 were increased, while chains with DP of 11 to 22 were decreased in amylopectin from DPE1-overexpressing seeds. By contrast, chains with DP of 6 to 8 and 16 to 36 were decreased, while chains with DP of 9 to 15 were increased in amylopectin from DPE1-suppressed seeds. Changes in DPE1 gene expression also resulted in modifications in the thermal and pasting features of endosperm starch granules. In vitro analyses revealed that recombinant DPE1 can break down amylose into maltooligosaccharides in the presence of Glc, while it can transfer maltooligosyl groups from maltooligosaccharide to amylopectin or transfer maltooligosyl groups within and among amylopectin molecules in the absence of Glc. Moreover, a metabolic flow of maltooligosyl groups from amylose to amylopectin was clearly identifiable when comparing DPE1-overexpressing lines with DPE1-suppressed lines. These findings demonstrate that DPE1 participates substantially in starch synthesis in rice endosperm by transferring maltooligosyl groups from amylose and amylopectin to amylopectin.
26332571	A node-localized transporter OsZIP3 is responsible for the preferential distribution of Zn to developing tissues in rice.	2015	Plant J	Developing tissues such as meristem with low transpiration require high Zn levels for their active growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the preferential distribution to these tissues are poorly understood. We found that a member of the ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein), OsZIP3, showed high expression in the nodes of rice (Oryza sativa). Immunostaining revealed that OsZIP3 was localized at the xylem intervening parenchyma cells and xylem transfer cells of the enlarged vascular bundle in both basal and upper nodes. Neither OsZIP3 gene expression nor encoded protein was affected by either deficiency or toxic levels of Zn. Knockdown of OsZIP3 resulted in significantly reduced Zn levels in the shoot basal region containing the shoot meristem and elongating zone, but increased Zn levels in the transpiration flow. A short-term experiment with the (67) Zn stable isotope showed that more Zn was distributed to the lower leaves, but less to the shoot elongating zone and nodes in the knockdown lines compared with the wild-type rice at both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Taken together, OsZIP3 located in the node is responsible for unloading Zn from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, which is the first step for preferential distribution of Zn to the developing tissues in rice.
26443104	Revisiting the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway using genome scale metabolic model of Oryza sativa japonica.	2015	Sci Rep	Chlorophyll is one of the most important pigments present in green plants and rice is one of the major food crops consumed worldwide. We curated the existing genome scale metabolic model (GSM) of rice leaf by incorporating new compartment, reactions and transporters. We used this modified GSM to elucidate how the chlorophyll is synthesized in a leaf through a series of bio-chemical reactions spanned over different organelles using inorganic macronutrients and light energy. We predicted the essential reactions and the associated genes of chlorophyll synthesis and validated against the existing experimental evidences. Further, ammonia is known to be the preferred source of nitrogen in rice paddy fields. The ammonia entering into the plant is assimilated in the root and leaf. The focus of the present work is centered on rice leaf metabolism. We studied the relative importance of ammonia transporters through the chloroplast and the cytosol and their interlink with other intracellular transporters. Ammonia assimilation in the leaves takes place by the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) which is present in the cytosol (GS1) and chloroplast (GS2). Our results provided possible explanation why GS2 mutants show normal growth under minimum photorespiration and appear chlorotic when exposed to air.
25982420	Cytotoxic activity and induction of inflammatory mediators of the methanol:chloroform extract of Fusarium moniliforme.	None	Rev Iberoam Micol	BACKGROUND: Fusarium moniliforme is a phytopathogenic facultative fungus with a cosmopolitan distribution in all types of climates, and has a wide host range, including, among others, bean, rice, wheat and sorghum crops. There is a current lack of knowledge regarding the potential of these fungi, so it is considered to be of great importance to obtain information related to the biological activity of extracts and secondary metabolites.

AIMS: An evaluation of the role of methanol:chloroform extract of F. moniliforme in the production of inflammatory cytokines and their cytotoxic activity.

METHODS: The production of nitric oxide was analyzed by the Griess method, the production of cytokines using ELISA, and the effects of the extract on cell cycle and induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry.

RESULTS: The extract of F. moniliforme was seen to be able to stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production in J774A.1 cells, as well as to produce cytokines such as, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. It was also observed that the extract of F. moniliforme produces activity on cell cycle modulation and apoptosis when tested in carcinogenic cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this study open the possibility of obtaining and identifying metabolites of the extract of F. moniliforme that can be evaluated for possible use in cancer therapy.
26486996	The pleiotropic ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF1 affects plant height, floral development and grain yield in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Moderate plant height and successful establishment of reproductive organs play pivotal roles in rice grain production. The molecular mechanism that controls the two aspects remains unclear in rice. In the present study, we characterized a rice gene, ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF1 (AFD1) that determined plant height, floral development and grain yield. The afd1 mutant showed variable defects including the dwarfism, long panicle, low seed setting and reduced grain yield. In addition, abnormal floral organs were also observed in the afd1 mutant including slender and thick hulls, and hull-like lodicules. AFD1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein and was expressed in all tested tissues and organs. Subcellular localization showed AFD1-green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) was localized in the nucleus. Meantime, our results suggested that AFD1 regulated the expression of cell division and expansion related genes.
26511914	Engineering Monolignol p-Coumarate Conjugates into Poplar and Arabidopsis Lignins.	2015	Plant Physiol	Lignin acylation, the decoration of hydroxyls on lignin structural units with acyl groups, is common in many plant species. Monocot lignins are decorated with p-coumarates by the polymerization of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates. The acyltransferase involved in the formation of these conjugates has been identified in a number of model monocot species, but the effect of monolignol p-coumarate conjugates on lignification and plant growth and development has not yet been examined in plants that do not inherently possess p-coumarates on their lignins. The rice (Oryza sativa) p-COUMAROYL-Coenzyme A MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE gene was introduced into two eudicots, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus alba × grandidentata), and a series of analytical methods was used to show the incorporation of the ensuing monolignol p-coumarate conjugates into the lignin of these plants. In poplar, specifically, the addition of these conjugates did not occur at the expense of the naturally incorporated monolignol p-hydroxybenzoates. Plants expressing the p-COUMAROYL-Coenzyme A MONOLIGNOL TRANSFERASE transgene can therefore produce monolignol p-coumarate conjugates essentially without competing with the formation of other acylated monolignols and without drastically impacting normal monolignol production.
26520834	New insight into the catalytic properties of rice sucrose synthase.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Sucrose synthase (SuS), which catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose and uridine diphosphate (UDP) into fructose and UDP-glucose, is a key enzyme in sucrose metabolism in higher plants. SuS belongs to family 4 of the glycosyltransferases (GT4) and contains an E-X7-E motif that is conserved in members of GT4 and two other GT families. To gain insight into the roles of this motif in rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSuS3), the two conserved glutamate residues (E678 and E686) in this motif and a phenylalanine residue (F680) that resides between the two glutamate residues were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutant proteins maintained their tetrameric conformation. The mutants E686D and F680Y retained partial enzymatic activity and the mutants E678D, E678Q, F680S, and E686Q were inactive. Substrate binding assays indicated that UDP and fructose, respectively, were the leading substrates in the sucrose degradation and synthesis reactions of RSuS3. Mutations on E678, F680, and E686 affected the binding of fructose, but not of UDP. The results indicated that E678, F680, and E686 in the E-X7-E motif of RSuS3 are essential for the activity of the enzyme and the sequential binding of substrates. The sequential binding of the substrates implied that the reaction catalyzed by RSuS can be controlled by the availability of fructose and UDP, depending on the metabolic status of a tissue.
26518431	Brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic gene lhdd10 controls late heading and plant height in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A Brd2 allele suppresses heading date by altering the expression of heading date regulators such as OsMADS50 , and also negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis. Heading date and plant height are important determinants of yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we characterized a late heading, dwarf mutant known as lhdd10 selected following ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treatment of ssp. indica cultivar 93-11. lhdd10 showed late heading, dwarfness and slightly darker-green leaves than wild-type 93-11 under long-day and short-day conditions. We isolated lhdd10 by map-based cloning; it encoded a putative FAD-linked oxidoreductase protein (a brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene) that localized to the nucleus. LHDD10 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but more so in shoot apices and panicles. Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions. lhdd10 also negatively regulated expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content. Our data indicated that BRs play important roles in regulating heading date and chlorophyll biosynthesis. This work provides material that will allow study of how BRs regulate heading date in rice.
26490377	Computational Identification, Target Prediction, and Validation of Conserved miRNAs in Insulin Plant (Costus pictus D. Don).	2016	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Insulin plant (Costus pictus D. Don) is an economically important medicinal plant for the content of its high value secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds, and remarkable flowering features. MicroRNAs are a class of short (∼21 nucleotides), endogenous, noncoding RNA molecules that play a vital role in regulating gene expression. Here, we used a computer-based homology approach to identify conserved miRNAs in Transcribed Sequence Assemblies (TSA) of C. pictus. It led us to identify 42 miRNAs of 13 different families in C. pictus for the first time. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, we further confirmed the expression of 8 miRNAs (miR394, miR159b, miR166k, miR172, miR159f, miR166, miR144, and miR858) in young and mature leaf tissues. A total of 109 potential target genes of the identified miRNAs were subsequently predicted in rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. The target genes encode transcription factors, enzymes, and various functional proteins involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways. The findings in the present study lay the foundation for further research on miRNAs and miRNA-mediated gene regulation in this important medicinal plant.
26479191	DNA-free genome editing in plants with preassembled CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins.	2015	Nat Biotechnol	Editing plant genomes without introducing foreign DNA into cells may alleviate regulatory concerns related to genetically modified plants. We transfected preassembled complexes of purified Cas9 protein and guide RNA into plant protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana, tobacco, lettuce and rice and achieved targeted mutagenesis in regenerated plants at frequencies of up to 46%. The targeted sites contained germline-transmissible small insertions or deletions that are indistinguishable from naturally occurring genetic variation.
26477688	The key regulator of submergence tolerance, SUB1A, promotes photosynthetic and metabolic recovery from submergence damage in rice leaves.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	The submergence-tolerance regulator, SUBMERGENCE1A (SUB1A), of rice (Oryza sativa L.) modulates gene regulation, metabolism and elongation growth during submergence. Its benefits continue during desubmergence through protection from reactive oxygen species and dehydration, but there is limited understanding of SUB1A's role in physiological recovery from the stress. Here, we investigated the contribution of SUB1A to desubmergence recovery using the two near-isogenic lines, submergence-sensitive M202 and tolerant M202(Sub1). No visible damage was detected in the two genotypes after 3 d of submergence, but the sublethal stress differentially altered photosynthetic parameters and accumulation of energy reserves. Submergence inhibited photosystem II photochemistry and stimulated breakdown of protein and accumulation of several amino acids in both genotypes at similar levels. Upon desubmergence, however, more rapid return to homeostasis of these factors was observed in M202(Sub1). Submergence considerably restrained non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in M202, whereas the value was unaltered in M202(Sub1) during the stress. Upon reaeration, submerged plants encounter sudden exposure to higher light. A greater capability for NPQ-mediated photoprotection can benefit the rapid recovery of photosynthetic performance and energy reserve metabolism in M202(Sub1). Our findings illuminate the significant role of SUB1A in active physiological recovery upon desubmergence, a component of enhanced tolerance to submergence.
26512058	Complex molecular mechanisms underlying seedling salt tolerance in rice revealed by comparative transcriptome and metabolomic profiling.	2016	J Exp Bot	To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying seedling salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the phenotypic, metabolic, and transcriptome responses of two related rice genotypes, IR64 and PL177, with contrasting salt tolerance were characterized under salt stress and salt+abscisic acid (ABA) conditions. PL177 showed significantly less salt damage, lower Na(+)/K(+) ratios in shoots, and Na(+) translocation from roots to shoots, attributed largely to better salt exclusion from its roots and salt compartmentation of its shoots. Exogenous ABA was able to enhance the salt tolerance of IR64 by selectively decreasing accumulation of Na(+) in its roots and increasing K(+) in its shoots. Salt stress induced general and organ-specific increases of many primary metabolites in both rice genotypes, with strong accumulation of several sugars plus proline in shoots and allantoin in roots. This was due primarily to ABA-mediated repression of genes for degradation of these metabolites under salt. In PL177, salt specifically up-regulated genes involved in several pathways underlying salt tolerance, including ABA-mediated cellular lipid and fatty acid metabolic processes and cytoplasmic transport, sequestration by vacuoles, detoxification and cell-wall remodeling in shoots, and oxidation-reduction reactions in roots. Combined genetic and transcriptomic evidence shortlisted relatively few candidate genes for improved salt tolerance in PL177.
26333774	Two forward genetic screens for vein density mutants in sorghum converge on a cytochrome P450 gene in the brassinosteroid pathway.	2015	Plant J	The specification of vascular patterning in plants has interested plant biologists for many years. In the last decade a new context has emerged for this interest. Specifically, recent proposals to engineer C(4) traits into C(3) plants such as rice require an understanding of how the distinctive venation pattern in the leaves of C(4) plants is determined. High vein density with Kranz anatomy, whereby photosynthetic cells are arranged in encircling layers around vascular bundles, is one of the major traits that differentiate C(4) species from C(3) species. To identify genetic factors that specify C(4) leaf anatomy, we generated ethyl methanesulfonate- and γ-ray-mutagenized populations of the C(4) species sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and screened for lines with reduced vein density. Two mutations were identified that conferred low vein density. Both mutations segregated in backcrossed F(2) populations as homozygous recessive alleles. Bulk segregant analysis using next-generation sequencing revealed that, in both cases, the mutant phenotype was associated with mutations in the CYP90D2 gene, which encodes an enzyme in the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway. Lack of complementation in allelism tests confirmed this result. These data indicate that the brassinosteroid pathway promotes high vein density in the sorghum leaf, and suggest that differences between C(4) and C(3) leaf anatomy may arise in part through differential activity of this pathway in the two leaf types.
26511913	Polyploidy Enhances F1 Pollen Sterility Loci Interactions That Increase Meiosis Abnormalities and Pollen Sterility in Autotetraploid Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Intersubspecific autotetraploid rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica × japonica) hybrids have greater biological and yield potentials than diploid rice. However, the low fertility of intersubspecific autotetraploid hybrids, which is largely caused by high pollen abortion rates, limits their commercial utility. To decipher the cytological and molecular mechanisms underlying allelic interactions in autotetraploid rice, we developed an autotetraploid rice hybrid that was heterozygous (S(i)S(j)) at F1 pollen sterility loci (Sa, Sb, and Sc) using near-isogenic lines. Cytological studies showed that the autotetraploid had higher percentages (>30%) of abnormal chromosome behavior and aberrant meiocytes (>50%) during meiosis than did the diploid rice hybrid control. Analysis of gene expression profiles revealed 1,888 genes that were differentially expressed between the autotetraploid and diploid hybrid lines at the meiotic stage, among which 889 and 999 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Of the 999 down-regulated genes, 940 were associated with the combined effect of polyploidy and pollen sterility loci interactions (IPE). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis identified a prominent functional gene class consisting of seven genes related to photosystem I (Gene Ontology 0009522). Moreover, 55 meiosis-related or meiosis stage-specific genes were associated with IPE in autotetraploid rice, including Os02g0497500, which encodes a DNA repair-recombination protein, and Os02g0490000, which encodes a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These results suggest that polyploidy enhances epistatic interactions between alleles of pollen sterility loci, thereby altering the expression profiles of important meiosis-related or meiosis stage-specific genes and resulting in high pollen sterility.
26451896	2D-DIGE-based proteome expression changes in leaves of rice seedlings exposed to low-level gamma radiation at Iitate village, Fukushima.	2015	Plant Signal Behav	The present study continues our previous research on investigating the biological effects of low-level gamma radiation in rice at the heavily contaminated Iitate village in Fukushima, by extending the experiments to unraveling the leaf proteome. 14-days-old plants of Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were subjected to gamma radiation level of upto 4 µSv/h, for 72 h. Following exposure, leaf samples were taken from the around 190 µSv/3 d exposed seedling and total proteins were extracted. The gamma irradiated leaf and control leaf (harvested at the start of the experiment) protein lysates were used in a 2-D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) experiment using CyDye labeling in order to asses which spots were differentially represented, a novelty of the study. 2D-DIGE analysis revealed 91 spots with significantly different expression between samples (60 positive, 31 negative). MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analyses revealed those as comprising of 59 different proteins (50 up-accumulated, 9 down-accumulated). The identified proteins were subdivided into 10 categories, according to their biological function, which indicated that the majority of the differentially expressed proteins consisted of the general (non-energy) metabolism and stress response categories. Proteome-wide data point to some effects of low-level gamma radiation exposure on the metabolism of rice leaves.
26498172	Identification of novel alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54.	2015	Sci Rep	Rice blast is one of the most devastating rice diseases and continuous resistance breeding is required to control the disease. The rice blast resistance gene Pi54 initially identified in an Indian cultivar confers broad-spectrum resistance in India. We explored the allelic diversity of the Pi54 gene among 885 Indian rice genotypes that were found resistant in our screening against field mixture of naturally existing M. oryzae strains as well as against five unique strains. These genotypes are also annotated as rice blast resistant in the International Rice Genebank database. Sequence-based allele mining was used to amplify and clone the Pi54 allelic variants. Nine new alleles of Pi54 were identified based on the nucleotide sequence comparison to the Pi54 reference sequence as well as to already known Pi54 alleles. DNA sequence analysis of the newly identified Pi54 alleles revealed several single polymorphic sites, three double deletions and an eight base pair deletion. A SNP-rich region was found between a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site and the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain. Together, the newly identified Pi54 alleles expand the allelic series and are candidates for rice blast resistance breeding programs.
26473722	Efficient Secretion of Recombinant Proteins from Rice Suspension-Cultured Cells Modulated by the Choice of Signal Peptide.	2015	PLoS One	Plant-based expression systems have emerged as a competitive platform in the large-scale production of recombinant proteins. By adding a signal peptide, αAmy3sp, the desired recombinant proteins can be secreted outside transgenic rice cells, making them easy to harvest. In this work, to improve the secretion efficiency of recombinant proteins in rice expression systems, various signal peptides including αAmy3sp, CIN1sp, and 33KDsp have been fused to the N-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and introduced into rice cells to explore the efficiency of secretion of foreign proteins. 33KDsp had better efficiency than αAmy3sp and CIN1sp for the secretion of GFP from calli and suspension-cultured cells. 33KDsp was further applied for the secretion of mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) from transgenic rice suspension-cultured cells; approximately 76%-92% of total rice-derived mGM-CSF (rmGM-CSF) was detected in the culture medium. The rmGM-CSF was bioactive and could stimulate the proliferation of a murine myeloblastic leukemia cell line, NSF-60. The extracellular yield of rmGM-CSF reached 31.7 mg/L. Our study indicates that 33KDsp is better at promoting the secretion of recombinant proteins in rice suspension-cultured cell systems than the commonly used αAmy3sp.
26543735	Ensifer-mediated transformation: an efficient non-Agrobacterium protocol for the genetic modification of rice.	2015	Springerplus	While Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) remains the most widely used technique for gene transfer in plants, interest exists for the use of non-Agrobacterium gene delivery systems due to freedom-to-operate issues that remain with AMT across several jurisdictions. In addition, the plant pathogenic mode of action of Agrobacterium tumefaciens significantly increases the costs to passage engineered cultivars through the regulatory process. Ensifer adhaerens (OV14) is a soil-related bacterium with the proven ability to genetically modify the model plant A. thaliana and the staple crop S. tuberosum (Wendt et al., Trans Res 21:567-578, 2012). While previous work was relevant for dicotyledonous species, in this study, the efficacy of Ensifer adhaerens (OV14)-mediated transformation (EMT) was determined on two japonica rice varieties, Curinga and Nipponbare, and the recalcitrant indica variety, IR64. The results indicated that E. adhaerens (OV14) exhibits infection efficiencies ranging between 50-70 %, 90-100 % and 90-95 % for Curinga, Nipponbare and IR64 respectively. Curinga and Nipponbare plants transformed with E. adhaerens (OV14) and A. tumefaciens (LBA4404 and EHA105) were regenerated achieving transformation efficiencies of 16 % and 26-32 % for Curinga and 7 and 4 % for Nipponbare respectively. Separately, the transformation of IR64 was only recorded via EMT (transformation efficiency ~1 %). Integration analyses conducted on 24 transgenic rice lines illustrated that T-DNA insertion occurred randomly throughout the rice genome for EMT (and AMT), with similar integration patterns in the rice genomic DNA observed for both bacterial species.
26476396	Functional characterization of a transition metal ion transporter, OsZIP6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Micronutrients are important for the growth and development of plants, which deploy families of transporters for their uptake and distribution. We have functionally characterized a novel transition metal ion transporter from rice, OsZIP6 (Oryza sativa zinc regulated transporter, iron regulated transporter-like protein 6). The transporter was found to be transcriptionally activated in shoot and root tissues in response to deficiency in Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Mn(2+). OsZIP6 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, where currents were observed on addition of Co(2+), Fe(2+) and Cd(2+) but not Zn(2+), Mn(2+) and Ni(2+). This substrate range for OsZIP6, identified using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ion transport by OsZIP6 was found to be pH dependent and enhanced transport was observed at acidic pH. Radioisotope uptake suggested that Co(2+) competitively inhibits Fe(2+) uptake by OsZIP6. Identification and characterization of ZIP family members from crop plants will contribute to an understanding of nutrient mineral homeostasis in these plants.
26488581	Transgenic Rice Expressing Ictb and FBP/Sbpase Derived from Cyanobacteria Exhibits Enhanced Photosynthesis and Mesophyll Conductance to CO2.	2015	PLoS One	To find a way to promote the rate of carbon flux and further improve the photosynthetic rate in rice, two CO2-transporting and fixing relevant genes, Ictb and FBP/Sbpase, which were derived from cyanobacteria with the 35SCaMV promotor in the respective constructs, were transformed into rice. Three homologous transgenic groups with Ictb, FBP/Sbpase and the two genes combined were constructed in parallel, and the functional effects of these two genes were investigated by physiological, biochemical and leaf anatomy analyses. The results indicated that the mesophyll conductance and net photosynthetic rate were higher at approximately 10.5-36.8% and 13.5-34.6%, respectively, in the three groups but without any changes in leaf anatomy structure compared with wild type. Other physiological and biochemical parameters increased with the same trend in the three groups, which showed that the effect of FBP/SBPase on improving photosynthetic capacity was better than that of ICTB and that there was an additive effect in ICTB+FBP/SBPase. ICTB localized in the cytoplasm, whereas FBP/SBPase was successfully transported to the chloroplast. The two genes might show a synergistic interaction to promote carbon flow and the assimilation rate as a whole. The multigene transformation engineering and its potential utility for improving the photosynthetic capacity and yield in rice were discussed.
26497693	Terminalia arjuna bark extract alleviates nickel toxicity by suppressing its uptake and modulating antioxidative defence in rice seedlings.	2016	Protoplasma	Terminalia arjuna (Ta) bark contains various natural antioxidants and has been used to protect animal cells against oxidative stress. In the present study, we have examined alleviating effects of Ta bark aqueous extract against Ni toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). When rice seedlings were raised for 8 days in hydroponics in Yoshida nutrient medium containing 200 μM NiSO4, a decline in height, reduced biomass, increased Ni uptake, loss of root plasma membrane integrity, increase in the level of O2˙-, H2O2 and ˙OH, increased lipid peroxidation, decline in photosynthetic pigments, increase in the level of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and alterations in their isoenzyme profile patterns were observed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed damage to chloroplasts marked by disorganised enlarged starch granules and disrupted thylakoids under Ni toxicity. Exogenously adding Ta bark extract (3.2 mg ml-1) to the growth medium considerably alleviated Ni toxicity in the seedlings by reducing Ni uptake, suppressing generation of reactive oxygen species, reducing lipid peroxidation, restoring level of photosynthesis pigments and ultrastructure of chloroplasts, and restoring levels of antioxidative enzymes. Results suggest that Ta bark extract considerably alleviates Ni toxicity in rice seedlings by preventing Ni uptake and reducing oxidative stress in the seedlings.
26492850	Identification of a phosphinothricin-resistant mutant of rice glutamine synthetase using DNA shuffling.	2015	Sci Rep	To date, only bar/pat gene derived from Streptomyces has been used to generate the commercial PPT-resistant crops currently available in the market. The limited source of bar/pat gene is probably what has caused the decrease in PPT-tolerance, which has become the main concern of those involved in field management programs. Although glutamine synthetase (GS) is the target enzyme of PPT, little study has been reported about engineering PPT-resistant plants with GS gene. Then, the plant-optimized GS gene from Oryza sativa (OsGS1S) was chemically synthesized in the present study by PTDS to identify a GS gene for developing PPT-tolerant plants. However, OsGS1S cannot be directly used for developing PPT-tolerant plants because of its poor PPT-resistance. Thus, we performed DNA shuffling on OsGS1S, and one highly PPT-resistant mutant with mutations in four amino acids (A63E, V193A, T293A and R295K) was isolated after three rounds of DNA shuffling and screening. Among the four amino acids substitutions, only R295K was identified as essential in altering PPT resistance. The R295K mutation has also never been previously reported as an important residue for PPT resistance. Furthermore, the mutant gene has been transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis to confirm its potential in developing PPT-resistant crops.
26441054	Fine mapping of a palea defective 1 (pd1), a locus associated with palea and stamen development in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : pd1, a genetic factor in a 69 kb region between RM11239 and RM11245 on rice chromosome 1, controls stamen number and palea development. Spikelets are important organs that store photosynthetic products in rice. Spikelet development directly affects grain yield and rice quality. Here, we report a palea defective (pd1) mutant identified from selfing progenies of indica cv. 93-11 after (60)Co γ ray treatment. pd1 mutant flowers only had four stamens (wild-type has six), but pollen fertility was not affected. Compared with 93-11 palea, pd1 mutant palea showed smaller and flatter leaf, which caused the lemma to bend excessively inward. pd1 mutants had only 46% seed setting rate and 21.6 g 1000-grain weight, which led to two-thirds loss of grain yield. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that pd1 mutants had reduced epidermal cell size and reduced numbers of fibrous sclerenchyma cells in both palea and lemma. To analyze the genetic factors involved, we crossed pd1 mutants with three japonica cultivars and generated F1 and F2 populations. The F1 phenotype and F2 segregation ratio indicated that a recessive gene controlled the mutant traits. Using the F2 population, we found that pd1 mapped between the simple sequence repeat markers RM11236 and RM11280 on rice chromosome 1. From a segregating population of 2836 plants, 77 recombinants were screened by RM11236 and RM11280. High-resolution linkage analysis narrowed the pd1 locus to a 69 kb region between RM11239 and RM11245 that contained 10 open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence alignment and quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis of these ORFs between 93-11 and pd1 mutant plants found no unequivocal evidence to identify the pd1 gene.
26470846	Destabilization of strigolactone receptor DWARF14 by binding of ligand and E3-ligase signaling effector DWARF3.	2015	Cell Res	Strigolactones (SLs) are endogenous hormones and exuded signaling molecules in plant responses to low levels of mineral nutrients. Key mediators of the SL signaling pathway in rice include the α/β-fold hydrolase DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box component DWARF 3 (D3) of the ubiquitin ligase SCF(D3) that mediate ligand-dependent degradation of downstream signaling repressors. One perplexing feature is that D14 not only functions as the SL receptor but is also an active enzyme that slowly hydrolyzes diverse natural and synthetic SLs including GR24, preventing the crystallization of a binary complex of D14 with an intact SL as well as the ternary D14/SL/D3 complex. Here we overcome these barriers to derive a structural model of D14 bound to intact GR24 and identify the interface that is required for GR24-mediated D14-D3 interaction. The mode of GR24-mediated signaling, including ligand recognition, hydrolysis by D14, and ligand-mediated D14-D3 interaction, is conserved in structurally diverse SLs. More importantly, D14 is destabilized upon the binding of ligands and D3, thus revealing an unusual mechanism of SL recognition and signaling, in which the hormone, the receptor, and the downstream effectors are systematically destabilized during the signal transduction process.
26504138	Enhanced Sucrose Loading Improves Rice Yield by Increasing Grain Size.	2015	Plant Physiol	Yield in cereals is a function of grain number and size. Sucrose (Suc), the main carbohydrate product of photosynthesis in higher plants, is transported long distances from source leaves to sink organs such as seeds and roots. Here, we report that transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa) expressing the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) phloem-specific Suc transporter (AtSUC2), which loads Suc into the phloem under control of the phloem protein2 promoter (pPP2), showed an increase in grain yield of up to 16% relative to wild-type plants in field trials. Compared with wild-type plants, pPP2::AtSUC2 plants had larger spikelet hulls and larger and heavier grains. Grain filling was accelerated in the transgenic plants, and more photoassimilate was transported from the leaves to the grain. In addition, microarray analyses revealed that carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism was enhanced in the leaves and grain of pPP2::AtSUC2 plants. Thus, enhancing Suc loading represents a promising strategy to improve rice yield to feed the global population.
26517906	Plant ABC transporters: time for biochemistry?	2015	Biochem Soc Trans	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins form a large and ubiquitous family, most members of which are membrane-associated primary transporters. Plant genomes code for a particularly large number of these ABC proteins, with more than 120 genes present in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). Although plant ABC transporters were initially identified as detoxifiers, sequestering xenobitotics into the vacuole, they were later found to be involved in a wide range of essential physiological processes. Currently, the exact substrates transported by most of these transporters are still unknown and we therefore cannot exclude that a single substrate (e.g. a hormone) is responsible for the diversity of physiological roles. This gap in our knowledge is mainly due to the fact that only a few studies have used direct methods to identify the substrates of these membrane transporters. To address this issue, transport assays involving isolated cells, vesicular membranes or reconstituted liposomes are essential. In this review, we will highlight the importance of the direct biochemical characterization of plant ABC transporters and give some insights into the current status of the homologous and heterologous expression of such proteins.
26496194	DCA1 Acts as a Transcriptional Co-activator of DST and Contributes to Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2015	PLoS Genet	Natural disasters, including drought and salt stress, seriously threaten food security. In previous work we cloned a key zinc finger transcription factor gene, Drought and Salt Tolerance (DST), a negative regulator of drought and salt tolerance that controls stomatal aperture in rice. However, the exact mechanism by which DST regulates the expression of target genes remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that DST Co-activator 1 (DCA1), a previously unknown CHY zinc finger protein, acts as an interacting co-activator of DST. DST was found to physically interact with itself and to form a heterologous tetramer with DCA1. This transcriptional complex appears to regulate the expression of peroxidase 24 precursor (Prx 24), a gene encoding an H2O2 scavenger that is more highly expressed in guard cells. Downregulation of DCA1 significantly enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice, and overexpression of DCA1 increased sensitivity to stress treatment. These phenotypes were mainly influenced by DCA1 and negatively regulated stomatal closure through the direct modulation of genes associated with H2O2 homeostasis. Our findings establish a framework for plant drought and salt stress tolerance through the DCA1-DST-Prx24 pathway. Moreover, due to the evolutionary and functional conservation of DCA1 and DST in plants, engineering of this pathway has the potential to improve tolerance to abiotic stress in other important crop species.
26467431	Evolution and divergence of SBP-box genes in land plants.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP)-box family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors that control many important biological functions, including phase transition, inflorescence branching, fruit ripening, and copper homeostasis. Nevertheless, the evolutionary patterns of SBP-box genes and evolutionary forces driving them are still not well understood.

METHODS: 104 SBP-box gene candidates of five representative land plants were obtained from Phytozome database (v10.3). Phylogenetic combined with gene structure analyses were used to identify SBP-box gene lineages in land plants. Gene copy number and the sequence and structure features were then compared among these different SBP-box lineages. Selection analysis, relative rate tests and expression divergence were finally used to interpret the evolutionary relationships and divergence of SBP-box genes in land plants.

RESULTS: We investigated 104 SBP-box genes from moss, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice, and maize. These genes are divided into group I and II, and the latter is further divided into two subgroups (subgroup II-1 and II-2) based on phylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, subgroup II-1 genes have similar sequence and structural features to group I genes, whereas subgroup II-2 genes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high copy numbers and the presence of miR156/miR529 regulation. Further analyses indicate that subgroup II-1 genes are constrained by stronger purifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than II-2 genes, just as group I genes do when compared to II genes. Among subgroup II-2 genes, miR156 targets evolve more rapidly than miR529 targets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection. These results suggest that group I and subgroup II-1 genes under strong selective constraint are conserved. By contrast, subgroup II-2 genes evolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through gene copy duplications and changes in miR156/529 regulation, which might contribute to morphological diversifications of land plants.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that different evolutionary rates and selection strengths lead to differing evolutionary patterns in SBP-box genes in land plants, providing a guide for future functional diversity analyses of these genes.
26452472	Gene stacking in plant cell using recombinases for gene integration and nucleases for marker gene deletion.	2015	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Practical approaches for multigene transformation and gene stacking are extremely important for engineering complex traits and adding new traits in transgenic crops. Trait deployment by gene stacking would greatly simplify downstream plant breeding and trait introgression into cultivars. Gene stacking into pre-determined genomic sites depends on mechanisms of targeted DNA integration and recycling of selectable marker genes. Targeted integrations into chromosomal breaks, created by nucleases, require large transformation efforts. Recombinases such as Cre-lox, on the other hand, efficiently drive site-specific integrations in plants. However, the reversibility of Cre-lox recombination, due to the incorporation of two cis-positioned lox sites, presents a major bottleneck in its application in gene stacking. Here, we describe a strategy of resolving this bottleneck through excision of one of the cis-positioned lox, embedded in the marker gene, by nuclease activity.

METHODS: All transgenic lines were developed by particle bombardment of rice callus with plasmid constructs. Standard molecular approach was used for building the constructs. Transgene loci were analyzed by PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing.

RESULTS: We developed a highly efficient gene stacking method by utilizing powerful recombinases such as Cre-lox and FLP-FRT, for site-specific gene integrations, and nucleases for marker gene excisions. We generated Cre-mediated site-specific integration locus in rice and showed excision of marker gene by I-SceI at ~20 % efficiency, seamlessly connecting genes in the locus. Next, we showed ZFN could be used for marker excision, and the locus can be targeted again by recombinases. Hence, we extended the power of recombinases to gene stacking application in plants. Finally, we show that heat-inducible I-SceI is also suitable for marker excision, and therefore could serve as an important tool in streamlining this gene stacking platform.

CONCLUSIONS: A practical approach for gene stacking in plant cell was developed that allows targeted gene insertions through rounds of transformation, a method needed for introducing new traits into transgenic lines for their rapid deployment in the field. By using Cre-lox, a powerful site-specific recombination system, this method greatly improves gene stacking efficiency, and through the application of nucleases develops marker-free, seamless stack of genes at pre-determined chromosomal sites.
26455463	Two Tightly Linked Genes at the hsa1 Locus Cause Both F1 and F2 Hybrid Sterility in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	Molecular mechanisms of hybrid breakdown associated with sterility (F2 sterility) are poorly understood as compared with those of F1 hybrid sterility. Previously, we characterized three unlinked epistatic loci, hybrid sterility-a1 (hsa1), hsa2, and hsa3, responsible for the F2 sterility in a cross between Oryza sativa ssp. indica and japonica. In this study, we identified that the hsa1 locus contains two interacting genes, HSA1a and HSA1b, within a 30-kb region. HSA1a-j (japonica allele) encodes a highly conserved plant-specific domain of unknown function protein (DUF1618), whereas the indica allele (HSA1a-i(s)) has two deletion mutations that cause disruption of domain structure. The second gene, HSA1b-i(s), encodes an uncharacterized protein with some similarity to a nucleotide-binding protein. Homozygous introgression of indica HSA1a-i(s)-HSA1b-i(s) alleles into japonica showed female gamete abortion at an early mitotic stage. The fact that the recombinant haplotype HSA1a-j-HSA1b-i(s) caused semi-sterility in the heterozygous state with the HSA1a-i(s)-HSA1b-i(s) haplotype suggests that variation in the hsa1 locus is a possible cause of the wide-spectrum sterility barriers seen in F1 hybrids and successive generations in rice. We propose a simple genetic model to explain how a single causal mechanism can drive both F1 and F2 hybrid sterility.
26640678	Screening of candidate genes and fine mapping of drought tolerance quantitative trait loci on chromosome 4 in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under drought stress.	2015	Ecol Evol	Due to severe water resource shortage, genetics of and breeding for DT (drought tolerance) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have become one of the hot research topics. Identification of grain yield QTLs (quantitative trait loci) directly related to the DT trait of rice can provide useful information for breeding new drought-resistant and water-saving rice varieties via marker-assisted selection. A population of 105 advanced BILs (backcross introgression lines) derived from a cross between Zhenshan97B and IRAT109 in Zhenshan97B background were grown under drought stress in a field experiment and phenotypic traits were investigated. The results showed that in the target interval of RM273-RM255 on chromosome 4, three main-effect QTLs related to panicle length, panicle number, and spikelet number per panicle were identified (LOD [logarithm of the odds] > 2.0). The panicle length-related QTL had two loci located in the neighboring intervals of RM17308-RM17305 and RM17349-RM17190, which explained 18.80% and 20.42%, respectively, of the phenotypic variation, while the panicle number-related QTL was identified in the interval of RM1354-RM17308, explaining 11.47% of the phenotypic variation. As far as the spikelet number per panicle-related QTL was concerned, it was found to be located in the interval of RM17308-RM17305, which explained 28.08% of the phenotypic variation. Using the online Plant-GE query system, a total of 13 matched ESTs (expressed sequence tags) were found in the target region, and of the 13 ESTs, 12 had corresponding predicted genes. For instance, the two ESTs CB096766 and CA765747 were corresponded to the same predicted gene LOC_Os04g46370, while the other four ESTs, CA754286, CB000011, CX056247, and CX056240, were corresponded to the same predicted gene LOC_Os04g46390.
26471973	The wheat durable, multipathogen resistance gene Lr34 confers partial blast resistance in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	The wheat gene Lr34 confers durable and partial field resistance against the obligate biotrophic, pathogenic rust fungi and powdery mildew in adult wheat plants. The resistant Lr34 allele evolved after wheat domestication through two gain-of-function mutations in an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene. An Lr34-like fungal disease resistance with a similar broad-spectrum specificity and durability has not been described in other cereals. Here, we transformed the resistant Lr34 allele into the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Transgenic rice plants expressing Lr34 showed increased resistance against multiple isolates of the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Host cell invasion during the biotrophic growth phase of rice blast was delayed in Lr34-expressing rice plants, resulting in smaller necrotic lesions on leaves. Lines with Lr34 also developed a typical, senescence-based leaf tip necrosis (LTN) phenotype. Development of LTN during early seedling growth had a negative impact on formation of axillary shoots and spikelets in some transgenic lines. One transgenic line developed LTN only at adult plant stage which was correlated with lower Lr34 expression levels at seedling stage. This line showed normal tiller formation and more importantly, disease resistance in this particular line was not compromised. Interestingly, Lr34 in rice is effective against a hemibiotrophic pathogen with a lifestyle and infection strategy that is different from obligate biotrophic rusts and mildew fungi. Lr34 might therefore be used as a source in rice breeding to improve broad-spectrum disease resistance against the most devastating fungal disease of rice.
26498441	Identification of stable QTLs causing chalk in rice grains in nine environments.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A novel QTL cluster for chalkiness on Chr04 was identified using single environment analysis and joint mapping across 9 environments in Asia and South American. QTL NILs showed that each had a significant effect on chalk. Chalk in rice grains leads to a significant loss in the proportion of marketable grains in a harvested crop, leading to a significant financial loss to rice farmers and traders. To identify the genetic basis of chalkiness, two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from reciprocal crosses between Lemont and Teqing were used to find stable QTLs for chalkiness. The RILs were grown in seven locations in Asia and Latin American and in two controlled environments in phytotrons. A total of 32 (21) and 46 (22) QTLs for DEC and PGWC, most of them explaining more than 10% of phenotypic variation, were detected based on single environment analysis in T/L (L/T) population, respectively. Seven (2) and 7 (3) QTLs for DEC and PGWC were identified in the T/L (L/T) population using joined analysis across all environments, respectively. Six major QTLs clusters were found on five chromosomes: 1, 2, 4, 5 and 11. The biggest cluster at id4007289-RM252 on Chr04 was a novelty, including 16 and 4 QTLs detected by single environment analysis and joint mapping across all environments, respectively. The detected digenic epistatic QTLs explained up to 13% of phenotypic variation, suggesting that epistasis play an important role in the genetic control of chalkiness in rice. QTL NILs showed that each QTL cluster had a significant effect on chalk. These chromosomal regions could be targets for MAS, fine mapping and map-based cloning for low chalkiness breeding.
26432387	Genetics and physiology of cell wall polysaccharides in the model C4 grass, Setaria viridis spp.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Setaria viridis has emerged as a model species for the larger C4 grasses. Here the cellulose synthase (CesA) superfamily has been defined, with an emphasis on the amounts and distribution of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, a cell wall polysaccharide that is characteristic of the grasses and is of considerable value for human health.

METHODS: Orthologous relationship of the CesA and Poales-specific cellulose synthase-like (Csl) genes among Setaria italica (Si), Sorghum bicolor (Sb), Oryza sativa (Os), Brachypodium distachyon (Bradi) and Hordeum vulgare (Hv) were compared using bioinformatics analysis. Transcription profiling of Csl gene families, which are involved in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis, was performed using real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). The amount of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan was measured using a modified Megazyme assay. The fine structures of the (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, as denoted by the ratio of cellotriosyl to cellotetraosyl residues (DP3:DP4 ratio) was assessed by chromatography (HPLC and HPAEC-PAD). The distribution and deposition of the MLG was examined using the specific antibody BG-1 and captured using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

RESULTS: The cellulose synthase gene superfamily contains 13 CesA and 35 Csl genes in Setaria. Transcript profiling of CslF, CslH and CslJ gene families across a vegetative tissue series indicated that SvCslF6 transcripts were the most abundant relative to all other Csl transcripts. The amounts of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in Setaria vegetative tissues ranged from 0.2% to 2.9% w/w with much smaller amounts in developing grain (0.003% to 0.013% w/w). In general, the amount of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan was greater in younger than in older tissues. The DP3:DP4 ratios varied between tissue types and across developmental stages, and ranged from 2.4 to 3.0:1. The DP3:DP4 ratios in developing grain ranged from 2.5 to 2.8:1. Micrographs revealing the distribution of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in walls of different cell types and the data were consistent with the quantitative (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan assays.

CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the cellulose synthase gene superfamily and the accumulation and distribution of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans in Setaria are similar to those in other C4 grasses, including sorghum. This suggests that Setaria is a suitable model plant for cell wall polysaccharide biology in C4 grasses.
26479064	Rubisco Activase Is Also a Multiple Responder to Abiotic Stresses in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (RCA) is a nuclear gene that encodes a chloroplast protein that plays an important role in photosynthesis. Some reports have indicated that it may play a role in acclimation to different abiotic stresses. In this paper, we analyzed the stress-responsive elements in the 2.0 kb 5'-upstream regions of the RCA gene promoter and the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. We identified some cis-elements of multiple stress-related components in the RCA promoter. Amino acid and evolution analyses showed that the RCA protein had conserved regions between different species; however, the size and type varied. The secondary structures, binding sites and tertiary structures of the RCA proteins were also different. This might reflect the differences in the transcription and translation levels of the two RCA isoforms during adaptation to different abiotic stresses. Although both the transcription and translation levels of RCA isoforms in the rice leaves increased under various stresses, the large isoform was increased more significantly in the chloroplast stroma and thylakoid. It can be concluded that RCA, especially RCAL, is also a multiple responder to abiotic stresses in rice, which provides new insights into RCA functions.
26432636	The Phytosiderophore Efflux Transporter TOM2 Is Involved in Metal Transport in Rice.	2015	J Biol Chem	Iron is an essential metal element for all living organisms. Graminaceous plants produce and secrete mugineic acid family phytosiderophores from their roots to acquire iron in the soil. Phytosiderophores chelate and solubilize insoluble iron hydroxide in the soil. Subsequently, plants take up iron-phytosiderophore complexes through specific transporters on the root cell membrane. Phytosiderophores are also thought to be important for the internal transport of various transition metals, including iron. In this study, we analyzed TOM2 and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil. Transgenic rice analysis using promoter-β-glucuronidase revealed that TOM2 was expressed in tissues involved in metal translocation, whereas TOM3 was expressed only in restricted parts of the plant. Strong TOM2 expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, whereas TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation. Transgenic rice in which TOM2 expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared with non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM2 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid, the initial phytosiderophore compound in the biosynthetic pathway in rice. In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the TOM2-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the TOM2 protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior. Our results indicate that TOM2 is involved in the internal transport of deoxymugineic acid, which is required for normal plant growth.
26398793	Silica distinctively affects cell wall features and lignocellulosic saccharification with large enhancement on biomass production in rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Rice is a typical silicon-accumulating crop with enormous biomass residues for biofuels. Silica is a cell wall component, but its effect on the plant cell wall and biomass production remains largely unknown. In this study, a systems biology approach was performed using 42 distinct rice cell wall mutants. We found that silica levels are significantly positively correlated with three major wall polymers, indicating that silica is associated with the cell wall network. Silicon-supplied hydroculture analysis demonstrated that silica distinctively affects cell wall composition and major wall polymer features, including cellulose crystallinity (CrI), arabinose substitution degree (reverse Xyl/Ara) of xylans, and sinapyl alcohol (S) proportion in three typical rice mutants. Notably, the silicon supplement exhibited dual effects on biomass enzymatic digestibility in the mutant and wild type (NPB) after pre-treatments with 1% NaOH and 1% H2SO4. In addition, silicon supply largely enhanced plant height, mechanical strength and straw biomass production, suggesting that silica rescues mutant growth defects. Hence, this study provides potential approaches for silicon applications in biomass process and bioenergy rice breeding.
26516867	Purification and Characterization of Cathepsin B from the Muscle of Horse Mackerel Trachurus japonicus.	2015	Mar Drugs	An endogenous protease in fish muscle, cathepsin B, was partially purified and characterized from horse mackerel meat. On SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme under reducing conditions, main protein bands were detected at 28 and 6 kDa and their respective N-terminal sequences showed high homology to heavy and light chains of cathepsin B from other species. This suggested that horse mackerel cathepsin B formed two-chain forms, similar to mammalian cathepsin Bs. Optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were 5.0 and 50 °C, respectively. A partial cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of 215 residues for horse mackerel cathepsin B was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a part of light and heavy chains of cathepsin B. The active sites and an N-glycosylation site were conserved across species. We also confirmed that the modori phenomenon was avoided by CA-074, a specific inhibitor for cathepsin B. Therefore, our results suggest that natural cysteine protease inhibitor(s), such as oryzacystatin derived from rice, can apply to thermal-gel processing of horse mackerel to avoid the modori phenomenon. Meanwhile, this endogenous protease may be used for food processing, such as weaning meal and food for the elderly.
26454879	Mitochondrial ORFH79 is Essential for Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	The mitochondrion is deemed to be one of the most important organelles, and plays an essential role in various biological processes. Nonetheless, the role of mitochondria in response to abiotic stress remains unclear. Here, we report that accumulation of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) protein ORFH79 in the vegetative tissues resulted in the dysfunction of mitochondria with decreased enzymatic activities of respiratory chain complexes, reduced ATP content and even a morphological change of the mitochondria. However, the suppression of orfH79 by overexpressing a fertility restorer gene Rf5, which is targeted to mitochondria and induced an endonucleolytic cleavage on the atp6-orfH79 transcripts, could recover the function of mitochondria and further significantly improved the tolerance to drought and salt stress. The above evidence suggests that the mitochondrion plays a pivotal role in tolerance to drought and salt stress in rice.
26474307	Overexpression of the potassium channel TPKb in small vacuoles confers osmotic and drought tolerance to rice.	2016	New Phytol	Potassium (K(+) ) is the most important cationic nutrient for all living organisms. Vacuolar two-pore K(+) (TPK) channels are important players in the regulation of cellular levels of K(+) but have not been characterised in rice. In order to assess the role of OsTPKb, a K(+) selective ion channel predominantly expressed in the tonoplast of small vacuoles, we generated overexpressing (OX) lines using a constitutive promoter and compared their phenotypes with control plants. Relative to control plants, OX lines showed better growth when exposed to low-K(+) or water stress conditions. K(+) uptake was greater in OX lines which may be driven by increased AKT1 and HAK1 activity. The enhanced K(+) uptake led to tissue K(+) levels that were raised in roots and shoots. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses showed a higher cytoplasm: vacuole K(+) ratio which is likely to contribute to the increased stress tolerance. In all, the data suggest that TPKb can alter the K(+) status of small vacuoles, which is important for general cellular K(+) homeostasis which, in turn, affects stress tolerance.
26456797	Comparative chemical screening and genetic analysis reveal tentoxin as a new virulence factor in Cochliobolus miyabeanus, the causal agent of brown spot disease on rice.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Brown spot disease, caused by Cochliobolus miyabeanus, is currently considered to be one of the most important yield reducers of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Despite its agricultural importance, little is known about the virulence mechanisms deployed by the fungus. Therefore, we set out to identify novel virulence factors with a role in disease development. This article reports, for the first time, the production of tentoxin by C. miyabeanus as a virulence factor during brown spot disease and the identification of the non-ribosomal protein synthetase (NRPS) CmNps3, responsible for tentoxin biosynthesis. We compared the chemical compounds produced by C. miyabeanus strains differing in virulence ability using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HRMS). The production of tentoxin by a highly virulent strain was revealed by principal component analysis of the detected ions and confirmed by UHPLC coupled to tandem-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The corresponding NRPS was identified by in silico genome analysis and confirmed by gene deletion. Infection tests with wild-type and Cmnps3 mutants showed that tentoxin acts as a virulence factor and is correlated with chlorosis development during the second phase of infection. Although rice has previously been classified as a tentoxin-insensitive plant species, our data demonstrate that tentoxin production by C. miyabeanus affects symptom development.
26463180	Mining microsatellite markers from public expressed sequence tags databases for the study of threatened plants.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are widely used in population genetic studies but their classical development is costly and time-consuming. The ever-increasing available DNA datasets generated by high-throughput techniques offer an inexpensive alternative for SSRs discovery. Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have been widely used as SSR source for plants of economic relevance but their application to non-model species is still modest.

METHODS: Here, we explored the use of publicly available ESTs (GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information-NCBI) for SSRs development in non-model plants, focusing on genera listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We also search two model genera with fully annotated genomes for EST-SSRs, Arabidopsis and Oryza, and used them as controls for genome distribution analyses. Overall, we downloaded 16 031 555 sequences for 258 plant genera which were mined for SSRsand their primers with the help of QDD1. Genome distribution analyses in Oryza and Arabidopsis were done by blasting the sequences with SSR against the Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana reference genomes implemented in the Basal Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) of the NCBI website. Finally, we performed an empirical test to determine the performance of our EST-SSRs in a few individuals from four species of two eudicot genera, Trifolium and Centaurea.

RESULTS: We explored a total of 14 498 726 EST sequences from the dbEST database (NCBI) in 257 plant genera from the IUCN Red List. We identify a very large number (17 102) of ready-to-test EST-SSRs in most plant genera (193) at no cost. Overall, dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats were the prevalent types but the abundance of the various types of repeat differed between taxonomic groups. Control genomes revealed that trinucleotide repeats were mostly located in coding regions while dinucleotide repeats were largely associated with untranslated regions. Our results from the empirical test revealed considerable amplification success and transferability between congenerics.

CONCLUSIONS: The present work represents the first large-scale study developing SSRs by utilizing publicly accessible EST databases in threatened plants. Here we provide a very large number of ready-to-test EST-SSR (17 102) for 193 genera. The cross-species transferability suggests that the number of possible target species would be large. Since trinucleotide repeats are abundant and mainly linked to exons they might be useful in evolutionary and conservation studies. Altogether, our study highly supports the use of EST databases as an extremely affordable and fast alternative for SSR developing in threatened plants.
26481460	Global identification and analysis of long non-coding RNAs in diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca during flower and fruit development.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new class of regulatory molecules with roles in diverse biological processes. While much effort has been invested in the analysis of lncRNAs from established plant models Arabidopsis, maize, and rice, almost nothing is known about lncRNAs from fruit crops, including those in the Rosaceae family.

RESULTS: Here, we present a genome-scale identification and characterization of lncRNAs from a diploid strawberry, Fragaria vesca, based on rich RNA-seq datasets from 35 different flower and fruit tissues. 5,884 Fve-lncRNAs derived from 3,862 loci were identified. These lncRNAs were carefully cataloged based on expression level and whether or not they contain repetitive sequences or generate small RNAs. About one fourth of them are termed high-confidence lncRNAs (hc-lncRNAs) because they are expressed at a level of FPKM higher than 2 and produce neither small RNAs nor contain repetitive sequence. To identify regulatory interactions between lncRNAs and their potential protein-coding (PC) gene targets, pairs of lncRNAs and PC genes with positively or negatively correlated expression trends were identified based on their expression; these pairs may be candidates of cis- or trans-acting lncRNAs and their targets. Finally, blast searches within plant species indicate that lncRNAs are not well conserved.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a large number of tissue-specifically expressed lncRNAs in F. vesca, thereby highlighting their potential contributions to strawberry flower and fruit development and paving the way for future functional studies.
26481230	Comparative Characterization of Aroma Volatiles and Related Gene Expression Analysis at Vegetative and Mature Stages in Basmati and Non-Basmati Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Cultivars.	2016	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Aroma volatiles in Basmati-370, Ambemohar-157 (non-basmati scented), and IR-64 (non-scented) rice cultivars were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed at vegetative and maturity stages to study their differential accumulation using headspace solid-phase microextraction, followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GCMS) with selected ion monitoring (SIM) approach. In addition, expression analysis of major aroma volatile 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP)-related genes, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (badh2) and Δ(1)-pyrolline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS), were studied by real-time PCR. Maximum number of volatiles recorded at vegetative (72-58) than at mature stage (54-39). Twenty new compounds (12 in scented and 8 in both) were reported in rice. N-containing aromatic compounds were major distinguishing class separating scented from non-scented. Among quantified 26 volatiles, 14 odor-active compounds distinguished vegetative and mature stage. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for 2AP was 0.001 mg/kg of 2AP and 0.01 g of rice, respectively. 2AP accumulation in mature grains was found three times more than in leaves of scented rice. Positive correlation of 2AP with 2-pentylfuran, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (E)-2-nonenal suggests their major role as aroma contributors. The badh2 expression was inversely and P5CS expression was positively correlated with 2AP accumulation in scented over non-scented cultivar.
26583021	Exogenous spermidine alleviates oxidative damage and reduce yield loss in rice submerged at tillering stage.	2015	Front Plant Sci	To figure out whether spermidine (Spd) can alleviate oxidative damage on rice (Oryza sativa L.) caused by submergence stress, Ningjing 3 was used in this study. The results showed that, spraying Spd on rice leaves at a concentration of 0.5 mM promoted the growth recovery of rice after drainage, such as green leaves, tillers, and aboveground dry mass. According to physiological analysis, Spd accelerate restored chlorophylls damage by submergence, and decreased the rate of [Formula: see text] generation and H2O2 content, inhibited submergence-induced lipid peroxidation. Spd also helped to maintain antioxidant enzyme activities after drainage, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and GR, which ultimately improved the recovery ability of submerged rice. With the effect of Spd, the rice yields increased by 12.1, 17.9, 13.5, and 18.0%, of which submerged for 1, 3, 5, 7 days, respectively. It is supposed that exogenous Spd really has an alleviate effect on submergence damage and reduce yield loss of rice.
26505442	Breeding of a target genotype variety based on identified chalkiness marker-QTL associations in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Genet Mol Res	The aim of this study was to breed a target genotype variety based on the identified chalkiness marker-QTL (quantitative trait locus) associations in rice. First, a permanent mapping population of rice that consisted of 525 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which were derived from Zhenshan 97/Minghui 63, was used to identify QTLs with additive effects for rice quantitative traits and percentage of grain chalkiness (PGC). Subsequently, based on the identified QTLs in rice, the molecular marker 68923-PGC was selected to screen the low chalkiness rice line. Then, using the integration of molecular marker breeding and traditional breeding, we analyzed the genotype and phenotype of inbred lines from 525 RILs; we identified one rice variety with particularly high yields, good taste, and broad adaptability. The new variety was temporarily named RIL10, which was a high quality, high yield, and broadly adaptable variety, and it is predominantly a feature that has contributed to its geographical adaptability, which would be planted from 35°E to 18°E in Chinain China, where 2/3 of rice production occurs. RIL10 was a marker-assisted selection breeding achievement for producing a high quality, high yield, and broadly adaptable rice variety.
26458744	Drought susceptibility of modern rice varieties: an effect of linkage of drought tolerance with undesirable traits.	2015	Sci Rep	Green Revolution (GR) rice varieties are high yielding but typically drought sensitive. This is partly due to the tight linkage between the loci governing plant height and drought tolerance. This linkage is illustrated here through characterization of qDTY1.1, a QTL for grain yield under drought that co-segregates with the GR gene sd1 for semi-dwarf plant height. We report that the loss of the qDTY1.1 allele during the GR was due to its tight linkage in repulsion with the sd1 allele. Other drought-yield QTLs (qDTY) also showed tight linkage with traits rejected in GR varieties. Genetic diversity analysis for 11 different qDTY regions grouped GR varieties separately from traditional drought-tolerant varieties, and showed lower frequency of drought tolerance alleles. The increased understanding and breaking of the linkage between drought tolerance and undesirable traits has led to the development of high-yielding drought-tolerant dwarf lines with positive qDTY alleles and provides new hope for extending the benefits of the GR to drought-prone rice-growing regions.
26506081	Diterpenoid phytoalexin factor, a bHLH transcription factor, plays a central role in the biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice.	2015	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs), momilactones and phytocassanes as major phytoalexins. Accumulation of DPs is induced in rice by blast fungus infection, copper chloride or UV light. Here, we describe a rice transcription factor named diterpenoid phytoalexin factor (DPF), which is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. The gene encoding DPF is expressed mainly in roots and panicles, and is inducible in leaves by blast infection, copper chloride or UV. Expression of all DP biosynthetic genes and accumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes were remarkably increased and decreased in DPF over-expressing and DPF knockdown rice, respectively. These results clearly demonstrated that DPF positively regulates DP accumulation via transcriptional regulation of DP biosynthetic genes, and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of DPs in rice. Furthermore, DPF activated the promoters of COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 (CPS2) and CYTOCHROME P450 MONOOXYGENASE 99A2 (CYP99A2), whose products are implicated in the biosynthesis of phytocassanes and momilactones, respectively. Mutations in the N-boxes in the CPS2 upstream region, to which several animal bHLH transcription factors bind, decreased CPS2 transcription, indicating that DPF positively regulates CPS2 transcription through the N-boxes. In addition, DPF partly regulates CYP99A2 through the N-box. This study demonstrates that DPF acts as a master transcription factor in DP biosynthesis.
26476017	Rice ASR1 and ASR5 are complementary transcription factors regulating aluminium responsive genes.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Rice is the most tolerant staple crop to aluminium (Al) toxicity, which is a limiting stress for grain production worldwide. This Al tolerance is the result of combined mechanisms that are triggered in part by the transcription factor ASR5. ASRs are dual target proteins that participate as chaperones in the cytoplasm and as transcription factors in the nucleus. Moreover, these proteins respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, including salt, drought and Al. Rice plants with silenced ASR genes are highly sensitive to Al. ASR5, a well-characterized protein, binds to specific cis elements in Al responsive genes and regulates their expression. Because the Al sensitive phenotype found in silenced rice plants could be due to the mutual silencing of ASR1 and ASR5, we investigated the effect of the specific silencing of ASR5. Plants with artificial microRNA silencing of ASR5 present a non-transformed phenotype in response to Al because of the induction of ASR1. ASR1 has the same subcellular localization as ASR5, binds to ASR5 cis-regulatory elements, regulates ASR5 regulated genes in a non-preferential manner and might replace ASR5 under certain conditions. Our results indicate that ASR1 and ASR5 act in concert and complementarily to regulate gene expression in response to Al.
26451709	Callose synthesis during reproductive development in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Callose, a linear β-1,3-glucan molecule, plays important roles in a variety of processes in angiosperms, including development and the response to biotic and abiotic stress. Despite the importance of callose deposition, our understanding of the roles of callose in rice reproductive development and the regulation of callose biosynthesis is limited. GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE genes encode callose synthases (GSLs), which function in the production of callose at diverse sites in plants. Studies have shown that callose participated in plant reproductive development, and that the timely deposition and degradation of callose were essential for normal male gametophyte development. In this mini-review, we described conserved sequences found in GSL family proteins from monocotyledonous (Oryza sativa and Zea mays) and dicotyledonous (Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max) plants. We also describe the latest findings on callose biosynthesis and deposition during reproductive development and discuss future challenges in unraveling the mechanism of callose synthesis and deposition in higher plants.
26500670	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Front Plant Sci	Dof (DNA binding with one finger) proteins, a class of plant-specific transcription factors, are involved in plant growth and developmental processes and stress responses. However, their biological functions remain to be elucidated, especially in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Previously, we have reported that OsDof12 can promote rice flowering under long-day conditions. Here, we further investigated the other important agronomical traits of the transgenic plants overexpressing OsDof12 and found that overexpressing OsDof12 could lead to reduced plant height, erected leaf, shortened leaf blade, and smaller panicle resulted from decreased primary and secondary branches number. These results implied that OsDof12 is involved in rice plant architecture formation. Furthermore, we performed a series of Brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive tests and found that overexpression of OsDof12 could also result in BR hyposensitivity. Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice. Taken together, our results suggested that overexpression of OsDof12 could lead to altered plant architecture by suppressing BR signaling. Thus, OsDof12 might be used as a new potential genetic regulator for future rice molecular breeding.
26515106	The role of strigolactones in root development.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Strigolactones (SLs) and their derivatives were recently defined as novel phytohormones that orchestrate shoot and root growth. Levels of SLs, which are produced mainly by plant roots, increase under low nitrogen and phosphate levels to regulate plant responses. Here, we summarize recent work on SL biology by describing their role in the regulation of root development and hormonal crosstalk during root deve-lopment. SLs promote the elongation of seminal/primary roots and adventitious roots (ARs) and they repress lateral root formation. In addition, auxin signaling acts downstream of SLs. AR formation is positively or negatively regulated by SLs depending largely on the plant species and experimental conditions. The relationship between SLs and auxin during AR formation appears to be complex. Most notably, this hormonal response is a key adaption that radically alters rice root architecture in response to nitrogen- and phosphate-deficient conditions.
26474992	A comprehensive meta-analysis of plant morphology, yield, stay-green, and virus disease resistance QTL in maize (Zea mays L.).	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The meta-QTL and candidate genes will facilitate the elucidation of molecular bases underlying agriculturally important traits and open new avenues for functional markers development and elite alleles introgression in maize breeding program. A large number of QTLs attributed to grain productivity and other agriculturally important traits have been identified and deposited in public repositories. The integration of fruitful QTL becomes a major issue in current plant genomics. To this end, we first collected QTL for six agriculturally important traits in maize, including yield, plant height, ear height, leaf angle, stay-green, and maize rough dwarf disease resistance. The meta-analysis method was then employed to retrieve 113 meta-QTL. Additionally, we also isolated candidate genes for target traits by the bioinformatic technique. Several candidates, including some well-characterized genes, GA3ox2 for plant height, lg1 and lg4 for leaf angle, zfl1 and zfl2 for flowering time, were co-localized with established meta-QTL intervals. Intriguingly, in a relatively narrow meta-QTL region, the maize ortholog of rice yield-related gene GW8/OsSPL16 was believed to be a candidate for yield. Leveraging results presented in this study will provide further insights into the genetic architecture of maize agronomic traits. Moreover, the meta-QTL and candidate genes reported here could be harnessed for the enhancement of stress tolerance and yield performance in maize and translation to other crops.
26001286	A novel biological role for nsLTP2 from Oriza sativa: Potential incorporation with anticancer agents, nucleosides and their analogues.	2015	Comput Biol Chem	Development of a protein-based drug delivery system has major impact on the efficacy and bioavailability of unstable and water insoluble drugs. In the present study, the binding modes of a nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) from Oryza sativa with various nucleosides and analogous molecules were identified. The 3-D structure of the protein was designed and validated using modeler 9.13, Molegro virtual docker and procheck tool, respectively. The binding affinity and strength of interactions, key contributing residues and specificity toward the substrates were accomplished by computational docking and model prediction. The protein presented high affinity to acyclovir and vidarabine as purine-analogous drugs. Binding affinity is influenced by the core template and functional groups of the ligands which are structurally different cause the variation of interaction energies with nsLTP2. Nonetheless, all the evaluated analogous drugs occupy the proximity space at the nsLTP active site with high similarity in their binding modes. Our findings hold great promise for the future applications of nsLTPs in various aspects of pharmaceutical science and molecular biology.
26462921	Developing a matrix reference material for screening of transgenic rice.	2015	Anal Bioanal Chem	Certified reference materials (CRMs) that are compatible with detection methods are needed to detect genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Screening is the first detection step in determining the possible presence of GMO ingredients in food or feed; however, screening has been hindered by the lack of GMO CRMs. In this study, transgenic rice materials were developed via the transformation of a construct harboring 11 commonly used screening elements. Digital PCR was utilized to identify a homozygous single-copy line termed SDrice. The qualitative detections of 11 elements in 21 transgenic materials demonstrated that the genomic DNA of the SDrice was suitable for use as a positive control in the screening of GMO ingredients. The suitability of SDrice as reference material was further checked by testing the sensitivity of 11 known conventional PCR assays, ranging from 10 to 50 copies of the SDrice genome. The standard curves that were created using SDrice DNA series as calibrators all exhibited good linearities in the relationships of the Ct values with the template copy numbers in these 11 real-time PCR assays. The LODs of the real-time PCR assays were estimated to be two to five copies of the SDrice genome. Comparisons of the SDrice with other GM rice revealed that significant differences existed in both the intercepts of the standard curves and the ΔCt values of the exogenous and reference genes for the P-35S, T-nos, HPT, T-35S, and Bar assays; the SDrice was not fit for quantification of other GM rice events. This study provided a matrix reference material (RM) that was suitable for screening GM rice, determination of sensitivity and a LOD of PCR assays, and overcame some of the drawbacks of plasmid DNA as reference material.
26457741	Judicious use of kinetin to improve growth and yield of rice in nickel contaminated soil.	2016	Int J Phytoremediation	The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of kinetin on growth and yield of rice in the presence and absence of nickel contamination. Rice seedlings were dipped in kinetin solution (10(-3), 10(-4) and 10 M(-5)) for 2 hours and transplanted in pots having soil contaminated with nickel sulfate @ 130 mg kg(-1). Experiment was laid out according to completely randomized design with four replications. Results revealed that kinetin significantly improved growth and yield of rice grown in nickel contamination. Kinetin @ 10(-4) M showed maximum improvement in plant height, paddy yield, 1000 grain weight, number of tillers and panicles up to 9.76, 15.72, 11.77, 11.87, and 10.90%, respectively, as compared to plants grown in contaminated soil without kinetin. Kinetin also improved the uptake of nutrients (NPK) in straw and grain of plants grown in Ni contaminated soil. Plants treated with kinetin had more concentration of Ni in shoot but less in grain compared to plants grown in Ni contaminated soil without application of kinetin. The application of kinetin can reduce stress effect on plants through improvement in the biomass of plant. This strategy could be used to increase the phytoextraction of Ni from the contaminated soil.
26460975	From Early Domesticated Rice of the Middle Yangtze Basin to Millet, Rice and Wheat Agriculture: Archaeobotanical Macro-Remains from Baligang, Nanyang Basin, Central China (6700-500 BC).	2015	PLoS One	Baligang is a Neolithic site on a northern tributary of the middle Yangtze and provides a long archaeobotanical sequence from the Seventh Millennium BC upto the First Millennium BC. It provides evidence for developments in rice and millet agriculture influenced by shifting cultural affiliation with the north (Yangshao and Longshan) and south (Qujialing and Shijiahe) between 4300 and 1800 BC. This paper reports on plant macro-remains (seeds), from systematic flotation of 123 samples (1700 litres), producing more than 10,000 identifiable remains. The earliest Pre-Yangshao occupation of the sites provide evidence for cultivation of rice (Oryza sativa) between 6300-6700 BC. This rice appears already domesticated in on the basis of a dominance of non-shattering spikelet bases. However, in terms of grain size changes has not yet finished, as grains are still thinner than more recent domesaticated rice and are closer in grain shape to wild rices. This early rice was cultivated alongside collection of wild staple foods, especially acorns (Quercus/Lithicarpus sensu lato). In later periods the sites has evidence for mixed farming of both rice and millets (Setaria italica and Panicum miliaceum). Soybean appears on the site in the Shijiahe period (ca.2500 BC) and wheat (Triticum cf. aestivum) in the Late Longshan levels (2200-1800 BC). Weed flora suggests an intensification of rice agriculture over time with increasing evidence of wetland weeds. We interpret these data as indicating early opportunistic cultivation of alluvial floodplains and some rainfed rice, developing into more systematic and probably irrigated cultivation starting in the Yangshao period, which intensified in the Qujialing and Shijiahe period, before a shift back to an emphasis on millets with the Late Longshan cultural influence from the north.

26351308	Epigenetic Mutation of RAV6 Affects Leaf Angle and Seed Size in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Heritable epigenetic variants of genes, termed epialleles, can broaden genetic and phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes. Epialleles may also provide a new source of beneficial traits for crop breeding, but very few epialleles related to agricultural traits have been identified in crops. Here, we identified Epi-rav6, a gain-of-function epiallele of rice (Oryza sativa) RELATED TO ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3)/VIVIPAROUS1 (VP1) 6 (RAV6), which encodes a B3 DNA-binding domain-containing protein. The Epi-rav6 plants show larger lamina inclination and smaller grain size; these agronomically important phenotypes are inherited in a semidominant manner. We did not find nucleotide sequence variation of RAV6. Instead, we found hypomethylation in the promoter region of RAV6, which caused ectopic expression of RAV6 in Epi-rav6 plants. Bisulfite analysis revealed that cytosine methylation of four CG and two CNG loci within a continuous 96-bp region plays essential roles in regulating RAV6 expression; this region contains a conserved miniature inverted repeat transposable element transposon insertion in cultivated rice genomes. Overexpression of RAV6 in the wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype. The brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BR INSENSITIVE1 and BR biosynthetic genes EBISU DWARF, DWARF11, and BR-DEFICIENT DWARF1 were ectopically expressed in Epi-rav6 plants. Also, treatment with a BR biosynthesis inhibitor restored the leaf angle defects of Epi-rav6 plants. This indicates that RAV6 affects rice leaf angle by modulating BR homeostasis and demonstrates an essential regulatory role of epigenetic modification on a key gene controlling important agricultural traits. Thus, our work identifies a unique rice epiallele, which may represent a common phenomenon in complex crop genomes.
26391157	The Usefulness of Known Genes/Qtls for Grain Quality Traits in an Indica Population of Diverse Breeding Lines Tested using Association Analysis.	2015	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: A number of studies reported major genes/QTLs for rice grain shapes, chalkiness and starch physicochemical properties. For these finely mapped QTLs or cloned genes to make an impact in practical breeding, it is necessary to test their effects in different genetic backgrounds. In this study, two hundred nineteen markers for 20 starch synthesis genes, 41 fine mapped grain shape and related traits QTLs/genes, and 54 chalkiness QTLs/genes plus 15 additional markers and a large indica population of 375 advanced lines were used to identify marker-trait associations under 6 environments that can be used directly in breeding for grain quality traits.

RESULTS: The significant associations detected by the QK model were used to declare the usefulness of the targeted genes/QTLs. A total of 65 markers were detected associations with grain quality trait at least in one environment. More phenotypic variations could be explained by haplotype than single marker, as exemplified by the starch biosynthesising genes. GBSSI was the major gene for AC and explained up to 55 % of the phenotypic variation, which also affected GC and accounted up to 11.31 % of the phenotypic variation. SSIIa was the major gene for chalkiness and explained up to 17 and 21 % of variation of DEC and PGWC, respectively. In addition, RMw513 and RM18068 were associated with DEC in 6 environments as well. Four markers (RGS1, RM15206, RMw513 and Indel1) tightly linked to GS3, gw5, and qGL7-2 were the most important ones for grain shapes. Allelic combinations between SSIIa and RMw513 revealed more variations in DEC.

CONCLUSIONS: The validated markers for genes/QTLs with major effects could be directly used in breeding for grain quality via marker-assisted selection. Creating desirable allelic combinations by gene pyramiding might be an effective approach for the development of high quality breeding lines in rice.
26324258	The diversity and abundance of As(III) oxidizers on root iron plaque is critical for arsenic bioavailability to rice.	2015	Sci Rep	Iron plaque is a strong adsorbent on rice roots, acting as a barrier to prevent metal uptake by rice. However, the role of root iron plaque microbes in governing metal redox cycling and metal bioavailability is unknown. In this study, the microbial community structure on the iron plaque of rice roots from an arsenic-contaminated paddy soil was explored using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. The microbial composition and diversity of the root iron plaque were significantly different from those of the bulk and rhizosphere soils. Using the aoxB gene as an identifying marker, we determined that the arsenite-oxidizing microbiota on the iron plaque was dominated by Acidovorax and Hydrogenophaga-affiliated bacteria. More importantly, the abundance of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria (AsOB) on the root iron plaque was significantly negatively correlated with the arsenic concentration in the rice root, straw and grain, indicating that the microbes on the iron plaque, particularly the AsOB, were actively catalyzing arsenic transformation and greatly influencing metal uptake by rice. This exploratory research represents a preliminary examination of the microbial community structure of the root iron plaque formed under arsenic pollution and emphasizes the importance of the root iron plaque environment in arsenic biogeochemical cycling compared with the soil-rhizosphere biotope.
26340904	Deciphering the roles of acyl-CoA-binding proteins in plant cells.	2016	Protoplasma	Lipid trafficking is vital for metabolite exchange and signal communications between organelles and endomembranes. Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are involved in the intracellular transport, protection, and pool formation of acyl-CoA esters, which are important intermediates and regulators in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of plant ACBP families from a cellular and developmental perspective. Plant ACBPs have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot) and to a lesser extent in Oryza sativa (a monocot). Thus far, they have been detected in the plasma membrane, vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, apoplast, cytosol, nuclear periphery, and peroxisomes. In combination with biochemical and molecular genetic tools, the widespread subcellular distribution of respective ACBP members has been explicitly linked to their functions in lipid metabolism during development and in response to stresses. At the cellular level, strong expression of specific ACBP homologs in specialized cells, such as embryos, stem epidermis, guard cells, male gametophytes, and phloem sap, is of relevance to their corresponding distinct roles in organ development and stress responses. Other interesting patterns in their subcellular localization and spatial expression that prompt new directions in future investigations are discussed.
26566840	Identification of candidate network hubs involved in metabolic adjustments of rice under drought stress by integrating transcriptome data and genome-scale metabolic network.	2016	Plant Sci	In this study, we have integrated a rice genome-scale metabolic network and the transcriptome of a drought-tolerant rice line, DK151, to identify the major transcriptional regulators involved in metabolic adjustments necessary for adaptation to drought. This was achieved by examining the differential expressions of transcription factors and metabolic genes in leaf, root and young panicle of rice plants subjected to drought stress during tillering, booting and panicle elongation stages. Critical transcription factors such as AP2/ERF, bZIP, MYB and NAC that control the important nodes in the gene regulatory pathway were identified through correlative analysis of the patterns of spatio-temporal expression and cis-element enrichment. We showed that many of the candidate transcription factors involved in metabolic adjustments were previously linked to phenotypic variation for drought tolerance. This approach represents the first attempt to integrate models of transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways for the identification of candidate regulatory genes for targeted selection in rice breeding.
26358849	Photosystem I cyclic electron flow via chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex performs a physiological role for photosynthesis at low light.	2015	Sci Rep	Cyclic electron transport around photosystem I (PS I) was discovered more than a half-century ago and two pathways have been identified in angiosperms. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the structure of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex, which mediates one route of the cyclic electron transport pathways, its physiological function is not well understood. Most studies focused on the role of the NDH-dependent PS I cyclic electron transport in alleviation of oxidative damage in strong light. In contrast, here it is shown that impairment of NDH-dependent cyclic electron flow in rice specifically causes a reduction in the electron transport rate through PS I (ETR I) at low light intensity with a concomitant reduction in CO2 assimilation rate, plant biomass and importantly, grain production. There was no effect on PS II function at low or high light intensity. We propose a significant physiological function for the chloroplast NDH at low light intensities commonly experienced during the reproductive and ripening stages of rice cultivation that have adverse effects crop yield.
26329877	Stress Tolerance Profiling of a Collection of Extant Salt-Tolerant Rice Varieties and Transgenic Plants Overexpressing Abiotic Stress Tolerance Genes.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Environmental stress tolerance is an important trait for crop improvement. In recent decades, numerous genes that confer tolerance to abiotic stress such as salinity were reported. However, the levels of salt tolerance differ greatly depending on growth conditions, and mechanisms underlying the complicated nature of stress tolerance are far from being fully understood. In this study, we investigated the profiles of stress tolerance of nine salt-tolerant rice varieties and transgenic rice lines carrying constitutively expressed genes that are potentially involved in salt tolerance, by evaluating their growth and viability under salt, heat, ionic and hyperosmotic stress conditions. Profiling of the extant varieties and selected chromosome segment substitution lines showed that salt tolerance in a greenhouse condition was more tightly correlated with ionic stress tolerance than osmotic stresses. In Nona Bokra, one of the most salt-tolerant varieties, the contribution of the previously identified sodium transporter HKT1;5 to salt tolerance was fairly limited. In addition, Nona Bokra exhibited high tolerance to all the stresses imposed. More surprisingly, comparative evaluation of 74 stress tolerance genes revealed that the most striking effect to enhance salt tolerance was conferred by overexpressing CYP94C2b, which promotes deactivation of jasmonate. In contrast, genes encoding ABA signaling factors conferred multiple stress tolerance. Genes conferring tolerance to both heat and hyperosmotic stresses were preferentially linked to functional categories related to heat shock proteins, scavenging of reactive oxygen species and Ca(2+) signaling. These comparative profiling data provide a new basis for understanding the ability of plants to grow under harsh environmental conditions.
26361777	Identification of altered metabolic pathways of γ-irradiated rice mutant via network-based transcriptome analysis.	2015	Genetica	In order to develop rice mutants for crop improvement, we applied γ-irradiation mutagenesis and selected a rice seed color mutant (MT) in the M14 targeting-induced local lesions in genome lines. This mutant exhibited differences in germination rate, plant height, and root length in seedlings compared to the wild-type plants. We found 1645 different expressed probes of MT by microarray hybridization. To identify the modified metabolic pathways, we conducted integrated genomic analysis such as weighted correlation network analysis with a module detection method of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MT on the basis of large-scale microarray transcriptional profiling. These modules are largely divided into three subnetworks and mainly exhibit overrepresented gene ontology functions such as oxidation-related function, ion-binding, and kinase activity (phosphorylation), and the expressional coherences of module genes mainly exhibited in vegetative and maturation stages. Through a metabolic pathway analysis, we detected the significant DEGs involved in the major carbohydrate metabolism (starch degradation), protein degradation (aspartate protease), and signaling in sugars and nutrients. Furthermore, the accumulation of amino acids (asparagine and glutamic acid), sucrose, and starch in MT were affected by gamma rays. Our results provide an effective approach for identification of metabolic pathways associated with useful agronomic traits in mutation breeding.
26414482	Effects of a diet containing genetically modified rice expressing the Cry1Ab/1Ac protein (Bacillus thuringiensis toxin) on broiler chickens.	2015	Arch Anim Nutr	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice expressing the Cry1Ab/1Ac protein on broiler chicken. The genetically modified (GM) Bt rice was compared with the corresponding non-GM rice regarding performance of feeding groups, their health status, relative organ weights, biochemical serum parameters and occurrence of Cry1Ab/1Ac gene fragments. One hundred and eighty day-old Arbor Acres female broilers with the same health condition were randomly allocated to the two treatments (6 replicate cages with 15 broilers in each cage per treatment). They received diets containing GM rice (GM group) or its parental non-GM rice (non-GM group) at 52-57% of the air-dried diet for 42 days. The results show that the transgenic rice had a similar nutrient composition as the non-GM rice and had no adverse effects on chicken growth, biochemical serum parameters and necropsy during the 42-day feeding period. In birds fed the GM rice, no transgenic gene fragments were detected in the samples of blood, liver, kidneys, spleen, jejunum, ileum, duodenum and muscle tissue. In conclusion, the results suggest that Bt rice expressing Cry1Ab/1Ac protein has no adverse effects on broiler chicken. Therefore, it can be considered as safe and used as feed source for broiler chicken.
26373662	Map-Based Cloning of Seed Dormancy1-2 Identified a Gibberellin Synthesis Gene Regulating the Development of Endosperm-Imposed Dormancy in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Natural variation in seed dormancy is controlled by multiple genes mapped as quantitative trait loci in major crop or model plants. This research aimed to clone and characterize the Seed Dormancy1-2 (qSD1-2) locus associated with endosperm-imposed dormancy and plant height in rice (Oryza sativa). qSD1-2 was delimited to a 20-kb region, which contains OsGA20ox2 and had an additive effect on germination. Naturally occurring or induced loss-of-function mutations of the gibberellin (GA) synthesis gene enhanced seed dormancy and also reduced plant height. Expression of this gene in seeds (including endospermic cells) during early development increased GA accumulation to promote tissue morphogenesis and maturation programs. The mutant allele prevalent in semidwarf cultivars reduced the seed GA content by up to 2-fold at the early stage, which decelerated tissue morphogenesis including endosperm cell differentiation, delayed abscisic acid accumulation by a shift in the temporal distribution pattern, and postponed dehydration, physiological maturity, and germinability development. As the endosperm of developing seeds dominates the moisture equilibrium and desiccation status of the embryo in cereal crops, qSD1-2 is proposed to control primary dormancy by a GA-regulated dehydration mechanism. Allelic distribution of OsGA20ox2, the rice Green Revolution gene, was associated with the indica and japonica subspeciation. However, this research provided no evidence that the primitive indica- and common japonica-specific alleles at the presumably domestication-related locus functionally differentiate in plant height and seed dormancy. Thus, the evolutionary mechanism of this agriculturally important gene remains open for discussion.
26410574	Characterization and fine mapping of a light-dependent leaf lesion mimic mutant 1 in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol Biochem	Plants that spontaneously produce lesion mimics or spots, without any signs of obvious adversity, such as pesticide and mechanical damage, or pathogen infection, are so-called lesion mimic mutants (lmms). In rice, many lmms exhibit enhanced resistance to pathogens, which provides a unique opportunity to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying lmms. We isolated a rice light-dependent leaf lesion mimic mutant 1 (llm1). Lesion spots appeared in the leaves of the llm1 mutant at the tillering stage. Furthermore, the mutant llm1 had similar agronomic traits to wild type rice. Trypan blue and diamiobenzidine staining analyses revealed that the lesion spot formation on the llm1 mutant was due to programmed cell death and reactive oxygen species. The chloroplasts were severely damaged in the llm1 mutant, suggesting that chloroplast damage was associated with the formation of lesion spots in llm1. More importantly, llm1 exhibited enhanced resistance to bacterial blight pathogens within increased expression of pathogenesis related genes (PRs). Using a map-based cloning approach, we delimited the LLM1 locus to a 121-kb interval between two simple sequence repeat markers, RM17470 and RM17473, on chromosome 4. We sequenced the candidate genes on the interval and found that a base mutation had substituted adenine phosphate for thymine in the last exon of LOC_Os04g52130, which led to an amino acid change (Asp(388) to Val) in the llm1 mutant. Our investigation showed that the putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPOX) encoded by LOC_Os04g52130 was produced by LLM1 and that amino acid Asp(388) was essential for CPOX function. Our study provides the basis for further investigations into the mechanism underlying lesion mimic initiation associated with LLM1.
26232644	Receptor protein kinase FERONIA controls leaf starch accumulation by interacting with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.	2015	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Cell expansion is coordinated by several cues, but available energy is the major factor determining growth. Receptor protein kinase FERONIA (FER) is a master regulator of cell expansion, but the details of its control mechanisms are not clear. Here we show that FER interacts with cytosolic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, GAPC1 and GAPC2), that catalyzes a key reaction in glycolysis, which contributes to energy production. When there is an FER deficiency, there are corresponding decreases in the enzyme activity of GAPDH and increased amounts of starch. More importantly, gapc1/2 mutants mimic fer4 mutants. These data indicate that FER regulated starch content is an evolutionarily conserved function in plants that connects the cell expansion and energy metabolism pathways.
26366992	OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production.	2015	Plant J	Grain size is an important agronomic trait in determining grain yield. However, the molecular mechanisms that determine the final grain size are not well understood. Here, we report the functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, dwarf and small grain1 (dsg1), which displays pleiotropic phenotypes, including small grains, dwarfism and erect leaves. Cytological observations revealed that the small grain and dwarfism of dsg1 were mainly caused by the inhibition of cell proliferation. Map-based cloning revealed that DSG1 encoded a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), OsMAPK6. OsMAPK6 was mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and was ubiquitously distributed in various organs, predominately in spikelets and spikelet hulls, consistent with its role in grain size and biomass production. As a functional kinase, OsMAPK6 interacts strongly with OsMKK4, indicating that OsMKK4 is likely to be the upstream MAPK kinase of OsMAPK6 in rice. In addition, hormone sensitivity tests indicated that the dsg1 mutant was less sensitive to brassinosteroids (BRs). The endogenous BR levels were reduced in dsg1, and the expression of several BR signaling pathway genes and feedback-inhibited genes was altered in the dsg1 mutant, with or without exogenous BRs, indicating that OsMAPK6 may contribute to influence BR homeostasis and signaling. Thus, OsMAPK6, a MAPK, plays a pivotal role in grain size in rice, via cell proliferation, and BR signaling and homeostasis.
26369665	Identification of four functionally important microRNA families with contrasting differential expression profiles between drought-tolerant and susceptible rice leaf at vegetative stage.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Developing drought-tolerant rice varieties with higher yield under water stressed conditions provides a viable solution to serious yield-reduction impact of drought. Understanding the molecular regulation of this polygenic trait is crucial for the eventual success of rice molecular breeding programmes. microRNAs have received tremendous attention recently due to its importance in negative regulation. In plants, apart from regulating developmental and physiological processes, microRNAs have also been associated with different biotic and abiotic stresses. Hence here we chose to analyze the differential expression profiles of microRNAs in three drought treated rice varieties: Vandana (drought-tolerant), Aday Sel (drought-tolerant) and IR64 (drought-susceptible) in greenhouse conditions via high-throughput sequencing.

RESULTS: Twenty-six novel microRNA candidates involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes were identified based on the detection of miRNA*. Out of their 110 predicted targets, we confirmed 16 targets from 5 novel microRNA candidates. In the differential expression analysis, mature microRNA members from 49 families of known Oryza sativa microRNA were differentially expressed in leaf and stem respectively with over 28 families having at least a similar mature microRNA member commonly found to be differentially expressed between both tissues. Via the sequence profiling data of leaf samples, we identified osa-miR397a/b, osa-miR398b, osa-miR408-5p and osa-miR528-5p as being down-regulated in two drought-tolerant rice varieties and up-regulated in the drought-susceptible variety. These microRNAs are known to be involved in regulating starch metabolism, antioxidant defence, respiration and photosynthesis. A wide range of biological processes were found to be regulated by the target genes of all the identified differentially expressed microRNAs between both tissues, namely root development (5.3-5.7 %), cell transport (13.2-18.4 %), response to stress (10.5-11.3 %), lignin catabolic process (3.8-5.3 %), metabolic processes (32.1-39.5 %), oxidation-reduction process (9.4-13.2 %) and DNA replication (5.7-7.9 %). The predicted target genes of osa-miR166e-3p, osa-miR166h-5p*, osa-miR169r-3p* and osa-miR397a/b were found to be annotated to several of the aforementioned biological processes.

CONCLUSIONS: The experimental design of this study, which features rice varieties with different drought tolerance and tissue specificity (leaf and stem), has provided new microRNA profiling information. The potentially regulatory importance of the microRNA genes mentioned above and their target genes would require further functional analyses.
26597356	Improving key enzyme activities and quality of rice under various methods of zinc application.	2015	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Zinc (Zn) is an important micronutrient for the physiology of plants. It is poorly available to the plants in soil solution. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate effectiveness of various Zn application methods on key enzyme activities and protein content of two contrasting rice genotypes viz., PD16 (Zn efficient) and NDR359 (Zn inefficient). The treatments were, control (0 mg Zn kg(-1) soil), soil application (5 mg Zn kg(-1) soil), foliar application (0.5 % ZnSO4 + 0.25 % lime at 30, 60 and 90 days after transplanting), soil (5 mg Zn kg(-1) soil) + foliar application of 0.5 % ZnSO4 + 0.25 % lime at 30, 60 and 90 days after transplanting. Among all the methods tested soil+foliar application of Zn fertilizers was found most effective in increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities as well as chlorophyll and protein content in both the rice varieties. NDR359, showed higher enzyme activities and more chlorophyll content in leaves than PD16, when Zn was applied either through foliar spray alone or in soil along with foliar application. Regarding the protein content in grains, PD16 showed higher protein content than NDR359, thus showed better translocation of Zn from leaves to grains.
26366116	Development of photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive male sterility rice expressing transgene Bacillus thuringiensis.	2015	Breed Sci	Stem borers and leaffolders are the main pests that cause severe damage in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production worldwide. We developed the first photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive male sterility (PTSMS) rice 208S with the cry1Ab/1Ac Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) gene, through sexual crossing with Huahui 1 (elite line with the cry1Ab/1Ac gene). The novel 208S and its hybrids presented high and stable resistance to stem borers and leaffolders, and the content of Cry1Ab/1Ac protein in chlorophyllous tissues achieved the identical level as donor and showed little accumulation in non-chlorophyllous tissue. No dominant dosage effect in the Bt gene was observed in 208S and its derived hybrids. An analysis of fertility transition traits indicated that 208S was completely sterile under long day length/high temperature, but partially fertile under short day length/low temperature. With fine grain quality and favorable combining ability, 208S had no observed negative effects on fertility and agronomic traits from Bt (cry1Ab/1Ac). Additionally, 208S as a male sterile line showed no fertility decrease caused by Bt transgenic process, as it is the case in Huahui 1. Thus, 208S has great application value in two-line hybrid production for insect resistance, and can also be used as a bridge material in rice Bt transgenic breeding.
26400163	PlantDHS: a database for DNase I hypersensitive sites in plants.	2016	Nucleic Acids Res	Gene expression is regulated by orchestrated binding of regulatory proteins to promoters and other cis-regulatory DNA elements (CREs). Several plant databases have been developed for mapping promoters or DNA motifs associated with promoters. However, there is a lack of databases that allow investigation for all CREs. Here we present PlantDHS (http://plantdhs.org), a plant DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) database that integrates histone modification, RNA sequencing, nucleosome positioning/occupancy, transcription factor binding sites, and genomic sequence within an easily navigated user interface. DHSs are indicative of all CREs, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and transcription factor binding sites; all of which play immense roles in global gene expression regulation. PlantDHS provides a platform to predict all CREs associated with individual genes from three model plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon and rice (Oryza sativa). PlantDHS is especially valuable in the detection of distant CREs that are located away from promoters.
26213119	OsPIN5b modulates rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture and yield by changing auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution.	2015	Plant J	Plant architecture attributes such as tillering, plant height and panicle size are important agronomic traits that determine rice (Oryza sativa) productivity. Here, we report that altered auxin content, transport and distribution affect these traits, and hence rice yield. Overexpression of the auxin efflux carrier-like gene OsPIN5b causes pleiotropic effects, mainly reducing plant height, leaf and tiller number, shoot and root biomass, seed-setting rate, panicle length and yield parameters. Conversely, reduced expression of OsPIN5b results in higher tiller number, more vigorous root system, longer panicles and increased yield. We show that OsPIN5b is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -localized protein that participates in auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution in vivo. This work describes an example of an auxin-related gene where modulating its expression can simultaneously improve plant architecture and yield potential in rice, and reveals an important effect of hormonal signaling on these traits.
26385373	Toward a better understanding of the genomic region harboring Fusarium head blight resistance QTL Qfhs.ndsu-3AS in durum wheat.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: New molecular markers were developed and mapped to the FHB resistance QTL region in high resolution. Micro-collinearity of the QTL region with rice and Brachypodium was revealed for a better understanding of the genomic region. The wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides)-derived Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) Qfhs.ndsu-3AS previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3A (3AS) in a population of recombinant inbred chromosome lines (RICLs). This study aimed to attain a better understanding of the genomic region harboring Qfhs.ndsu-3AS and to improve the utility of the QTL in wheat breeding. Micro-collinearity of the QTL region with rice chromosome 1 and Brachypodium chromosome 2 was identified and used for marker development in saturation mapping. A total of 42 new EST-derived sequence tagged site (STS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed and mapped to the QTL and nearby regions on 3AS. Further comparative analysis revealed a complex collinearity of the 3AS genomic region with their collinear counterparts of rice and Brachypodium. Fine mapping of the QTL region resolved five co-segregating markers (Xwgc1186/Xwgc716/Xwgc1143/Xwgc501/Xwgc1204) into three distinct loci proximal to Xgwm2, a marker previously reported to be closely linked to the QTL. Four other markers (Xwgc1226, Xwgc510, Xwgc1296, and Xwgc1301) mapped farther proximal to the above markers in the QTL region with a higher resolution. Five homozygous recombinants with shortened T. dicoccoides chromosomal segments in the QTL region were recovered by molecular marker analysis and evaluated for FHB resistance. Qfhs.ndsu-3AS was positioned to a 5.2 cM interval flanked by the marker Xwgc501 and Xwgc510. The recombinants containing Qfhs.ndsu-3AS and new markers defining the QTL will facilitate utilization of this resistance source in wheat breeding.
26378793	Suppression of Hydroxycinnamate Network Formation in Cell Walls of Rice Shoots Grown under Microgravity Conditions in Space.	2015	PLoS One	Network structures created by hydroxycinnamate cross-links within the cell wall architecture of gramineous plants make the cell wall resistant to the gravitational force of the earth. In this study, the effects of microgravity on the formation of cell wall-bound hydroxycinnamates were examined using etiolated rice shoots simultaneously grown under artificial 1 g and microgravity conditions in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility on the International Space Station. Measurement of the mechanical properties of cell walls showed that shoot cell walls became stiff during the growth period and that microgravity suppressed this stiffening. Amounts of cell wall polysaccharides, cell wall-bound phenolic acids, and lignin in rice shoots increased as the shoot grew. Microgravity did not influence changes in the amounts of cell wall polysaccharides or phenolic acid monomers such as ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid, but it suppressed increases in diferulic acid (DFA) isomers and lignin. Activities of the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX) in shoots also increased as the shoot grew. PAL activity in microgravity-grown shoots was almost comparable to that in artificial 1 g-grown shoots, while CW-PRX activity increased less in microgravity-grown shoots than in artificial 1 g-grown shoots. Furthermore, the increases in expression levels of some class III peroxidase genes were reduced under microgravity conditions. These results suggest that a microgravity environment modifies the expression levels of certain class III peroxidase genes in rice shoots, that the resultant reduction of CW-PRX activity may be involved in suppressing DFA formation and lignin polymerization, and that this suppression may cause a decrease in cross-linkages within the cell wall architecture. The reduction in intra-network structures may contribute to keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions.
26416765	Comprehensive analysis of the flowering genes in Chinese cabbage and examination of evolutionary pattern of CO-like genes in plant kingdom.	2015	Sci Rep	In plants, flowering is the most important transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. The flowering patterns of monocots and eudicots are distinctly different, but few studies have described the evolutionary patterns of the flowering genes in them. In this study, we analysed the evolutionary pattern, duplication and expression level of these genes. The main results were as follows: (i) characterization of flowering genes in monocots and eudicots, including the identification of family-specific, orthologous and collinear genes; (ii) full characterization of CONSTANS-like genes in Brassica rapa (BraCOL genes), the key flowering genes; (iii) exploration of the evolution of COL genes in plant kingdom and construction of the evolutionary pattern of COL genes; (iv) comparative analysis of CO and FT genes between Brassicaceae and Grass, which identified several family-specific amino acids, and revealed that CO and FT protein structures were similar in B. rapa and Arabidopsis but different in rice; and (v) expression analysis of photoperiod pathway-related genes in B. rapa under different photoperiod treatments by RT-qPCR. This analysis will provide resources for understanding the flowering mechanisms and evolutionary pattern of COL genes. In addition, this genome-wide comparative study of COL genes may also provide clues for evolution of other flowering genes.
26372017	Enzymatic transglycosylation of ginsenoside Rg1 by rice seed α-glucosidase.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Six α-monoglucosyl derivatives of ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1) were synthesized by transglycosylation reaction of rice seed α-glucosidase in the reaction mixture containing maltose as a glucosyl donor and G-Rg1 as an acceptor. Their chemical structures were identified by spectroscopic analysis, and the effects of reaction time, pH, and glycosyl donors on transglycosylation reaction were investigated. The results showed that rice seed α-glucosidase transfers α-glucosyl group from maltose to G-Rg1 by forming either α-1,3 (α-nigerosyl)-, α-1,4 (α-maltosyl)-, or α-1,6 (α-isomaltosyl)-glucosidic linkages in β-glucose moieties linked at the C6- and C20-position of protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type aglycone. The optimum pH range for the transglycosylation reaction was between 5.0 and 6.0. Rice seed α-glucosidase acted on maltose, soluble starch, and PNP α-D-glucopyranoside as glycosyl donors, but not on glucose, sucrose, or trehalose. These α-monoglucosyl derivatives of G-Rg1 were easily hydrolyzed to G-Rg1 by rat small intestinal and liver α-glucosidase in vitro.
26424157	Rice SPX-Major Facility Superfamily3, a Vacuolar Phosphate Efflux Transporter, Is Involved in Maintaining Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	To maintain a stable cytosol phosphate (Pi) concentration, plant cells store Pi in their vacuoles. When the Pi concentration in the cytosol decreases, Pi is exported from the vacuole into the cytosol. This export is mediated by Pi transporters on the tonoplast. In this study, we demonstrate that SYG1, PHO81, and XPR1 (SPX)-Major Facility Superfamily (MFS) proteins have a similar structure with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) low-affinity Pi transporters Phosphatase87 (PHO87), PHO90, and PHO91. OsSPX-MFS1, OsSPX-MFS2, and OsSPX-MFS3 all localized on the tonoplast of rice (Oryza sativa) protoplasts, even in the absence of the SPX domain. At high external Pi concentration, OsSPX-MFS3 could partially complement the yeast mutant strain EY917 under pH 5.5, which lacks all five Pi transporters present in yeast. In oocytes, OsSPX-MFS3 was shown to facilitate Pi influx or efflux depending on the external pH and Pi concentrations. In contrast to tonoplast localization in plants cells, OsSPX-MFS3 was localized to the plasma membrane when expressed in both yeast and oocytes. Overexpression of OsSPX-MFS3 results in decreased Pi concentration in the vacuole of rice tissues. We conclude that OsSPX-MFS3 is a low-affinity Pi transporter that mediates Pi efflux from the vacuole into cytosol and is coupled to proton movement.
26350041	Comparative genomic analysis of the WRKY III gene family in populus, grape, arabidopsis and rice.	2015	Biol Direct	BACKGROUND: WRKY III genes have significant functions in regulating plant development and resistance. In plant, WRKY gene family has been studied in many species, however, there still lack a comprehensive analysis of WRKY III genes in the woody plant species poplar, three representative lineages of flowering plant species are incorporated in most analyses: Arabidopsis (a model plant for annual herbaceous dicots), grape (one model plant for perennial dicots) and Oryza sativa (a model plant for monocots).

RESULTS: In this study, we identified 10, 6, 13 and 28 WRKY III genes in the genomes of Populus trichocarpa, grape (Vitis vinifera), Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the WRKY III proteins could be divided into four clades. By microsynteny analysis, we found that the duplicated regions were more conserved between poplar and grape than Arabidopsis or rice. We dated their duplications by Ks analysis of Populus WRKY III genes and demonstrated that all the blocks were formed after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Strong purifying selection has played a key role in the maintenance of WRKY III genes in Populus. Tissue expression analysis of the WRKY III genes in Populus revealed that five were most highly expressed in the xylem. We also performed quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis of WRKY III genes in Populus treated with salicylic acid, abscisic acid and polyethylene glycol to explore their stress-related expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the duplication and diversification of the WRKY III gene family in Populus and provided a comprehensive analysis of this gene family in the Populus genome. Our results indicated that the majority of WRKY III genes of Populus was expanded by large-scale gene duplication. The expression pattern of PtrWRKYIII gene identified that these genes play important roles in the xylem during poplar growth and development, and may play crucial role in defense to drought stress. Our results presented here may aid in the selection of appropriate candidate genes for further characterization of their biological functions in poplar.
26384983	Ammonium-induced architectural and anatomical changes with altered suberin and lignin levels significantly change water and solute permeabilities of rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Non-optimal ammonium levels significantly alter root architecture, anatomy and root permeabilities for water and nutrient ions. Higher ammonium levels induced strong apoplastic barriers whereas it was opposite for lower levels. Application of nitrogen fertilizer increases crop productivity. However, non-optimal applications can have negative effects on plant growth and development. In this study, we investigated how different levels of ammonium (NH4 (+)) [low (30 or 100 μM) or optimum (300 μM) or high (1000 or 3000 μM)] affect physio-chemical properties of 1-month-old, hydroponically grown rice roots. Different NH4 (+) treatments markedly altered the root architecture and anatomy. Plants grown in low NH4 (+) had the longest roots with a weak deposition of suberised and lignified apoplastic barriers, and it was opposite for plants grown in high NH4 (+). The relative expression levels of selected suberin and lignin biosynthesis candidate genes, determined using qRT-PCR, were lowest in the roots from low NH4 (+), whereas, they were highest for those grown in high NH4 (+). This was reflected by the suberin and lignin contents, and was significantly lower in roots from low NH4 (+) resulting in greater hydraulic conductivity (Lp r) and solute permeability (P sr) than roots from optimum NH4 (+). In contrast, roots grown at high NH4 (+) had markedly greater suberin and lignin contents, which were reflected by strong barriers. These barriers significantly decreased the P sr of roots but failed to reduce the Lp r below those of roots grown in optimum NH4 (+), which can be explained in terms of the physical properties of the molecules used and the size of pores in the apoplast. It is concluded that, in rice, non-optimal NH4 (+) levels differentially affected root properties including Lp r and P sr to successfully adapt to the changing root environment.
26442070	Importance of Mediator complex in the regulation and integration of diverse signaling pathways in plants.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Basic transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes is assisted by a number of cofactors, which either increase or decrease the rate of transcription. Mediator complex is one such cofactor, and recently has drawn a lot of interest because of its integrative power to converge different signaling pathways before channeling the transcription instructions to the RNA polymerase II machinery. Like yeast and metazoans, plants do possess the Mediator complex across the kingdom, and its isolation and subunit analyses have been reported from the model plant, Arabidopsis. Genetic, and molecular analyses have unraveled important regulatory roles of Mediator subunits at every stage of plant life cycle starting from flowering to embryo and organ development, to even size determination. It also contributes immensely to the survival of plants against different environmental vagaries by the timely activation of its resistance mechanisms. Here, we have provided an overview of plant Mediator complex starting from its discovery to regulation of stoichiometry of its subunits. We have also reviewed involvement of different Mediator subunits in different processes and pathways including defense response pathways evoked by diverse biotic cues. Wherever possible, attempts have been made to provide mechanistic insight of Mediator's involvement in these processes.
26403301	A gain-of-function Bushy dwarf tiller 1 mutation in rice microRNA gene miR156d caused by insertion of the DNA transposon nDart1.	2015	Sci Rep	A non-autonomous DNA transposon in rice, nDart1, is actively transposed in the presence of an autonomous element, aDart1, under natural conditions. The nDart1-promoted gene tagging line was developed using the endogenous nDart1/aDart1 system to generate various rice mutants effectively. While the dominant mutants were occasionally isolated from the tagging line, it was unclear what causes dominant mutations. A semidominant mutant, Bushy dwarf tiller1 (Bdt1), which has the valuable agronomic traits of multiple tillering and dwarfism, was obtained from the tagging line. Bdt1 mutant carried a newly inserted nDart1 at 38-bp upstream of transcription initiation site of a non-protein-coding gene, miR156d. This insertion caused an upstream shift of the miR156d transcription initiation site and, consequently, increased the functional transcripts producing mature microRNAs. These results indicate that the total amount of miR156d is controlled not only by transcript quantity but also by transcript quality. Furthermore, transgenic lines introduced an miR156d fragment that flanked the nDart1 sequence at the 5' region, suggesting that insertion of nDart1 in the gene promoter region enhances gene expression as a cis-element. This study demonstrates the ability of nDart1 to produce gain-of-function mutants as well as further insights into the function of transposable elements in genome evolution.
25985900	Truncated Ubiquitin 5' Regulatory Region from Erianthus arundinaceus Drives Enhanced Transgene Expression in Heterologous Systems.	2015	Mol Biotechnol	Characterization of novel plant gene promoters underpins the development of transgenic crop plants. Here, we report a novel 5' regulatory sequence (Eriubi D7) of the ubiquitin gene from Erianthus arundinaceus, a wild relative of sugarcane resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses. A 3.2-kb regulatory sequence of ubiquitin gene was isolated through random amplification of genomic ends technique and characterized in rice, tobacco, and sugarcane. In silico analysis revealed that the regulatory sequence contained a promoter region of 1600 bp upstream to the transcription start site. Between the promoter and the coding region, two putative introns of 584 and 583 bp and two putative non-coding exons of 459 and 37 bp were spaced alternatively. To identify the active domains required for gene regulation, 12 truncations/recombinants were made in the regulatory sequence and characterized in heterologous systems. Transformation studies with the recombinant constructs revealed that Eriubi D7, a truncated fragment containing 830 bp promoter and the intron I, conferred enhanced GUS reporter gene expression in both monocots and dicots compared to other routinely used promoters such as maize ubi1 and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S. Further analysis confirms that this regulatory sequence is quite distinct from the other reported ubiquitin promoters and was also found to enhance expression of the reporter gene upon wounding. This is the first report on the isolation and characterization of a promoter from a wild sugarcane germplasm and is expected to be useful for development of transgenic crop plants.
26439659	Priming of pathogenesis related-proteins and enzymes related to oxidative stress by plant growth promoting rhizobacteria on rice plants upon abiotic and biotic stress challenge.	2015	J Plant Physiol	Two plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were tested to evaluate their capacity to prime rice seedlings against stress challenge (salt and Xanthomonas campestris infection). As is accepted that plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enzyme activities related to oxidative stress (ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7), glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1)) as well as the pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) ß-1,3-glucanase (PR2, EC 3.2.1.6) and chitinase (PR3, EC 3.2.1.14) were measured at 3 time points after stress challenge. In addition, photosynthetic parameters related with fluorescence emission of photosystem II (F0, Fv/Fm, ΦPSII and NPQ) were also measured although they were barely affected. Both strains were able to protect rice seedlings against salt stress. AMG272 reduced the salt symptoms over 47% with regard to control, and L81 over 90%. Upon pathogen challenge, 90% protection was achieved by both strains. All enzyme activities related to oxidative stress were modified by the two PGPR, especially APX and SOD upon salinity stress challenge, and APX and GR upon pathogen presence. Both bacteria induced chitinase activity 24 and 48 h after pathogen inoculation, and L81 induced ß-1,3-Glucanase activity 48 h after pathogen inoculation, evidencing the priming effect. These results indicate that these strains could be used as bio-fortifying agents in biotechnological inoculants in order to reduce the effects of different stresses, and indirectly reduce the use of agrochemicals.
26442025	Tissue specific and abiotic stress regulated transcription of histidine kinases in plants is also influenced by diurnal rhythm.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Two-component system (TCS) is one of the key signal sensing machinery which enables species to sense environmental stimuli. It essentially comprises of three major components, sensory histidine kinase proteins (HKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (Hpts), and response regulator proteins (RRs). The members of the TCS family have already been identified in Arabidopsis and rice but the knowledge about their functional indulgence during various abiotic stress conditions remains meager. Current study is an attempt to carry out comprehensive analysis of the expression of TCS members in response to various abiotic stress conditions and in various plant tissues in Arabidopsis and rice using MPSS and publicly available microarray data. The analysis suggests that despite having almost similar number of genes, rice expresses higher number of TCS members during various abiotic stress conditions than Arabidopsis. We found that the TCS machinery is regulated by not only various abiotic stresses, but also by the tissue specificity. Analysis of expression of some representative members of TCS gene family showed their regulation by the diurnal cycle in rice seedlings, thus bringing-in another level of their transcriptional control. Thus, we report a highly complex and tight regulatory network of TCS members, as influenced by the tissue, abiotic stress signal, and diurnal rhythm. The insights on the comparative expression analysis presented in this study may provide crucial leads toward dissection of diverse role(s) of the various TCS family members in Arabidopsis and rice.
26415870	Hygromycin B-induced cell death is partly mediated by reactive oxygen species in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Plant Mol Biol	The aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B (Hyg) inhibits prokaryotic, chloroplast and mitochondrial protein synthesis. Because of the toxic effect of Hyg on plant cells, the HPT gene, encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase, has become one of the most widely used selectable markers in plant transformation. Yet the mechanism behind Hyg-induced cell lethality in plants is not clearly understood. In this study, we aimed to decipher this mechanism. With Hyg treatment, rice calli exhibited cell death, and rice seedlings showed severe growth defects, leaf chlorosis and leaf shrinkage. Rice seedlings also exhibited severe lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, for oxidative stress damage at the cellular level. The production of reactive oxygen species such as O2(·-), H2O2 and OH(·) was greatly induced in rice seedlings under Hyg stress, and pre-treatment with ascorbate increased resistance to Hyg-induced toxicity indicating the existence of oxidative stress. Overexpression of mitochondrial Alternative oxidase1a gene without HPT selection marker in rice enhanced tolerance to Hyg and attenuated the degradation of protein content, whereas the rice plastidial glutathione reductase 3 mutant showed increased sensitivity to Hyg. These results demonstrate that Hyg-induced cell lethality in rice is not only due to the inhibition of protein synthesis but also mediated by oxidative stress.
26399533	Gene expression profiling of flag leaves at the booting stage in the japonica hybrid rice Huayou14 and its parental lines by microarray.	2015	Yi Chuan	Gene expression profiling using microarray has contributed significantly to heterosis studies. Using the Affymetrix rice genome array, we investigated gene expression profiles in the flag leaves of the japonica hybrid rice Huayou14 and its parental cultivars Shen9A and Fan14 at the booting stage. A total of 2057 genes differentially expressed (fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5) between Huayou14 and its parents were identified. Functional classification of the differentially expressed genes by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in photosynthesis-related cellular component categories (e.g. photosystem Ⅰ, chloroplast membrane and chloroplast envelope), and biological process categories (e.g. chlorophyll catabolic, chlorophyll biosynthetic and carotenoid biosynthetic processes). These results suggest that the changes in the photosynthetic ability of the japonica hybrid rice Huayou14 may be related to heterosis. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in photosynthesis-antenna proteins and starch and sucrose metabolic pathways, instead of photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways as reported previously. These results suggest that different genes or metabolic pathways might contribute to the heterosis of different hybrid combinations.
26383862	Silicon Promotes Exodermal Casparian Band Formation in Si-Accumulating and Si-Excluding Species by Forming Phenol Complexes.	2015	PLoS One	We studied the effect of Silicon (Si) on Casparian band (CB) development, chemical composition of the exodermal CB and Si deposition across the root in the Si accumulators rice and maize and the Si non-accumulator onion. Plants were cultivated in nutrient solution with and without Si supply. The CB development was determined in stained root cross-sections. The outer part of the roots containing the exodermis was isolated after enzymatic treatment. The exodermal suberin was transesterified with MeOH/BF3 and the chemical composition was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine the Si deposition across root cross sections. Si promoted CB formation in the roots of Si-accumulator and Si non-accumulator species. The exodermal suberin was decreased in rice and maize due to decreased amounts of aromatic suberin fractions. Si did not affect the concentration of lignin and lignin-like polymers in the outer part of rice, maize and onion roots. The highest Si depositions were found in the tissues containing CB. These data along with literature were used to suggest a mechanism how Si promotes the CB development by forming complexes with phenols.
26523132	Efficiency to Discovery Transgenic Loci in GM Rice Using Next Generation Sequencing Whole Genome Re-sequencing.	2015	Genomics Inform	Molecular characterization technology in genetically modified organisms, in addition to how transgenic biotechnologies are developed now require full transparency to assess the risk to living modified and non-modified organisms. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methodology is suggested as an effective means in genome characterization and detection of transgenic insertion locations. In the present study, we applied NGS to insert transgenic loci, specifically the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in genetically modified rice cells. A total of 29.3 Gb (~72× coverage) was sequenced with a 2 × 150 bp paired end method by Illumina HiSeq2500, which was consecutively mapped to the rice genome and T-vector sequence. The compatible pairs of reads were successfully mapped to 10 loci on the rice chromosome and vector sequences were validated to the insertion location by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The EGF transgenic site was confirmed only on chromosome 4 by PCR. Results of this study demonstrated the success of NGS data to characterize the rice genome. Bioinformatics analyses must be developed in association with NGS data to identify highly accurate transgenic sites.
26421293	How to Isolate a Plant's Hypomethylome in One Shot.	2015	Biomed Res Int	Genome assembly remains a challenge for large and/or complex plant genomes due to their abundant repetitive regions resulting in studies focusing on gene space instead of the whole genome. Thus, DNA enrichment strategies facilitate the assembly by increasing the coverage and simultaneously reducing the complexity of the whole genome. In this paper we provide an easy, fast, and cost-effective variant of MRE-seq to obtain a plant's hypomethylome by an optimized methyl filtration protocol followed by next generation sequencing. The method is demonstrated on three plant species with knowingly large and/or complex (polyploid) genomes: Oryza sativa, Picea abies, and Crocus sativus. The identified hypomethylomes show clear enrichment for genes and their flanking regions and clear reduction of transposable elements. Additionally, genomic sequences around genes are captured including regulatory elements in introns and up- and downstream flanks. High similarity of the results obtained by a de novo assembly approach with a reference based mapping in rice supports the applicability for studying and understanding the genomes of nonmodel organisms. Hence we show the high potential of MRE-seq in a wide range of scenarios for the direct analysis of methylation differences, for example, between ecotypes, individuals, within or across species harbouring large, and complex genomes.
26442055	The auxin response factor gene family in banana: genome-wide identification and expression analyses during development, ripening, and abiotic stress.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Auxin signaling regulates various auxin-responsive genes via two types of transcriptional regulators, Auxin Response Factors (ARF) and Aux/IAA. ARF transcription factors act as critical components of auxin signaling that play important roles in modulating various biological processes. However, limited information about this gene family in fruit crops is currently available. Herein, 47 ARF genes were identified in banana based on its genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of the ARFs from banana, rice, and Arabidopsis suggested that the ARFs could be divided into four subgroups, among which most ARFs from the banana showed a closer relationship with those from rice than those from Arabidopsis. Conserved motif analysis showed that all identified MaARFs had typical DNA-binding and ARF domains, but 12 members lacked the dimerization domain. Gene structure analysis showed that the number of exons in MaARF genes ranged from 5 to 21, suggesting large variation amongst banana ARF genes. The comprehensive expression profiles of MaARF genes yielded useful information about their involvement in diverse tissues, different stages of fruit development and ripening, and responses to abiotic stresses in different varieties. Interaction networks and co-expression assays indicated the strong transcriptional response of banana ARFs and ARF-mediated networks in early fruit development for different varieties. Our systematic analysis of MaARFs revealed robust tissue-specific, development-dependent, and abiotic stress-responsive candidate MaARF genes for further functional assays in planta. These findings could lead to potential applications in the genetic improvement of banana cultivars, and yield new insights into the complexity of the control of MaARF gene expression at the transcriptional level. Finally, they support the hypothesis that ARFs are a crucial component of the auxin signaling pathway, which regulates a wide range of physiological processes.
26362270	Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of mesocotyl elongation based on re-sequencing approach in rice.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Mechanized dry seeded rice can save both labour and water resources. Rice seedling establishment is sensitive to sowing depth while mesocotyl elongation facilitates the emergence of deeply sown seeds.

RESULTS: A set of 270 rice accessions, including 170 from the mini-core collection of Chinese rice germplasm (C Collection) and 100 varieties used in a breeding program for drought resistance (D Collection), was screened for mesocotyl lengths of seedlings grown in water (MLw) in darkness and in 5 cm sand culture (MLs). Twenty six accessions (10.53 %) have MLw longer than 1.0 cm. Eleven accessions had the highest mesocotyl lengths, i.e. 1.4 - 5.05 cm of MLw and 3.0 - 6.4 cm in 10 cm sand culture, including 7 upland landraces or varieties. The genotypic data of 1,019,883 SNPs were developed by re-sequencing of those accessions. A whole-genome SNP array (Rice SNP50) was used to genotype 24 accessions as a validation panel, giving 98.41 % of consistent SNPs with the re-sequencing data in average. GWAS based on compressed mixed linear model was conducted using GAPIT. Based on a threshold of -log(P) ≥8.0, 13 loci were associated to MLw on rice chromosome 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, respectively. Three associated loci, on chromosome 3, 6, and 10, were detected for MLs. A set of 99 associated SNPs for MLw, based on a compromised threshold (-log(P) ≥7.0), located in intergenic regions or different positions of 36 annotated genes, including one cullin and one growth regulating factor gene.

CONCLUSIONS: Higher proportion and extension of elongated mesocotyls were observed in the mini-core collection of rice germplasm and upland rice landraces or varieties, possibly causing the correlation between mesocotyl elongation and drought resistance. GWAS found 13 loci for mesocotyl length measured in dark germination that confirmed the previously reported co-location of two QTLs across populations and experiments. Associated SNPs hit 36 annotated genes including function-matching candidates like cullin and GRF. The germplasm with elongated mesocotyl, especially upland landraces or varieties, and the associated SNPs could be useful in further studies and breeding of mechanized dry seeded rice.
26398683	CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	CHD3 is one of the chromatin-remodeling factors that contribute to controlling the expression of genes associated with plant development. Loss-of-function mutants display morphological and growth defects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CHD3 regulation of plant development remain unclear. In this study, a rice CHD3 protein, CHR729, was identified. The corresponding mutant line (t483) exhibited late seed germination, low germination rate, dwarfism, low tiller number, root growth inhibition, adaxial albino leaves, and short and narrow leaves. CHR729 encoded a nuclear protein and was expressed in almost all organs. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that several plant hormone-related genes were up- or down-regulated in t483 compared to wild type. In particular, expression of the gibberellin synthetase gibberellin 20 oxidase 4 gene was elevated in the mutant. Endogenous gibberellin assays demonstrated that the content of bioactive GA3 was reduced in t483 compared to wild type. Moreover, the seedling dwarfism, late seed germination, and short root length phenotypes of t483 were partially rescued by treatment with exogenous GA3. These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway.
26338659	Convergent Loss of Awn in Two Cultivated Rice Species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima Is Caused by Mutations in Different Loci.	2015	G3 (Bethesda)	A long awn is one of the distinct morphological features of wild rice species. This organ is thought to aid in seed dispersal and prevent predation by animals. Most cultivated varieties of Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, however, have lost the ability to form long awns. The causal genetic factors responsible for the loss of awn in these two rice species remain largely unknown. Here, we evaluated three sets of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in a common O. sativa genetic background (cv. Koshihikari) that harbor genomic fragments from Oryza nivara, Oryza rufipogon, and Oryza glaberrima donors. Phenotypic analyses of these libraries revealed the existence of three genes, Regulator of Awn Elongation 1 (RAE1), RAE2, and RAE3, involved in the loss of long awns in cultivated rice. Donor segments at two of these genes, RAE1 and RAE2, induced long awn formation in the CSSLs whereas an O. sativa segment at RAE3 induced long awn formation in O. glaberrima. These results suggest that the two cultivated rice species, O. sativa and O. glaberrima, have taken independent paths to become awnless.
26392263	Two ATP Binding Cassette G Transporters, Rice ATP Binding Cassette G26 and ATP Binding Cassette G15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	2015	Plant Physiol	Male reproduction in higher plants requires the support of various metabolites, including lipid molecules produced in the innermost anther wall layer (the tapetum), but how the molecules are allocated among different anther tissues remains largely unknown. Previously, rice (Oryza sativa) ATP binding cassette G15 (ABCG15) and its Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ortholog were shown to be required for pollen exine formation. Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice. Cytological and chemical analyses indicate that osabcg26 shows reduced transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells for anther cuticle development. Supportively, the localization of OsABCG26 is on the plasma membrane of the anther wall layers. By contrast, OsABCG15 is polarly localized in tapetal plasma membrane facing anther locules. osabcg26 osabcg15 double mutant displays an almost complete absence of anther cuticle and pollen exine, similar to that of osabcg15 single mutant. Taken together, we propose that OsABCG26 and OsABCG15 collaboratively regulate rice male reproduction: OsABCG26 is mainly responsible for the transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells to anther wall layers, whereas OsABCG15 mainly is responsible for the export of lipidic molecules from the tapetal cells to anther locules for pollen exine development.
26363148	Effects of cadmium on bioaccumulation and biochemical stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	This study investigated the effects of various Cd concentrations on the bioaccumulation, antioxidative defense, and stress responses of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The distribution characteristics of Cd in rice were in the following order: roots>stems>grains. The bioconcentration factor values of Cd increased at concentrations lower than 3.00 mg Cd/kg and approximately decreased to a constant value at concentrations higher than 3.00 mg Cd/kg. Rice showed a higher Cd accumulation potential at low Cd concentrations than at high Cd concentrations. The Freundlich isotherm model described well the adsorption isotherms of Cd in rice roots. The biosorption mechanism of rice roots was determined to be cooperative adsorption. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased at a concentration range of 0.00-5.00 mg/L, indicating the enhancement of lipid peroxidation. By contrast, the MDA content slightly decreased at concentrations higher than 5.00 mg/L. Peroxidase (POD) activity exhibited active response to oxidative stress at concentrations lower than 5.00 mg/L but was inhibited at concentrations higher than 5.00 mg/L. The response to Cd stress of the N-H, O-H and C-O functional groups in rice shoots was observed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
26419216	Seed priming with polyethylene glycol regulating the physiological and molecular mechanism in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under nano-ZnO stress.	2015	Sci Rep	The present study was designed to highlight the impact of seed priming with polyethylene glycol on physiological and molecular mechanism of two cultivars of Oryza sativa L. under different levels of zinc oxide nanorods (0, 250, 500 and 750 mg L(-1)). Plant growth parameters were significantly increased in seed priming with 30% PEG under nano-ZnO stress in both cultivars. Whereas, this increase was more prominent in cultivar Qian You No. 1 as compared to cultivar Zhu Liang You 06. Significant increase in photosynthetic pigment with PEG priming under stress. Antioxidant enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly reduced with PEG priming under nano-ZnO stress. Gene expression analysis also suggested that expression of APXa, APXb, CATa, CATb, CATc, SOD1, SOD2 and SOD3 genes were down regulated with PEG priming as compared to non-primed seeds under stress. The ultrastructural analysis showed that leaf mesophyll and root cells were significantly damaged under nano-ZnO stress in both cultivars but the damage was prominent in Zhu Liang You 06. However, seed priming with PEG significantly alleviate the toxic effects of nano-ZnO stress and improved the cell structures of leaf and roots in both cultivars.

26341416	Tiling Assembly: a new tool for reference annotation-independent transcript assembly and novel gene identification by RNA-sequencing.	2015	DNA Res	Annotation of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome has evolved significantly since release of its draft sequence, but it is far from complete. Several published transcript assembly programmes were tested on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to determine their effectiveness in identifying novel genes to improve the rice genome annotation. Cufflinks, a popular assembly software, did not identify all transcripts suggested by the RNA-seq data. Other assembly software was CPU intensive, lacked documentation, or lacked software updates. To overcome these shortcomings, a heuristic ab initio transcript assembly algorithm, Tiling Assembly, was developed to identify genes based on short read and junction alignment. Tiling Assembly was compared with Cufflinks to evaluate its gene-finding capabilities. Additionally, a pipeline was developed to eliminate false-positive gene identification due to noise or repetitive regions in the genome. By combining Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks, 767 unannotated genes were identified in the rice genome, demonstrating that combining both programmes proved highly efficient for novel gene identification. We also demonstrated that Tiling Assembly can accurately determine transcription start sites by comparing the Tiling Assembly genes with their corresponding full-length cDNA. We applied our pipeline to additional organisms and identified numerous unannotated genes, demonstrating that Tiling Assembly is an organism-independent tool for genome annotation.
26363880	Diterpenes from the roots of Oryza sativa L. and their inhibition activity on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.	2015	Chem Biodivers	Two new pimarane diterpenoids, momilactone D (3) and momilactone E (5), along with three known diterpenoids, momilactone A (1), sandaracopimaradien-3-one (2), and oryzalexin A (4) were isolated from Oryza sativa roots. The chemical structures of the compounds were determined by spectroscopic data analysis. The isolated diterpenoids were evaluated for their ability to inhibit NO production and iNOS mRNA and protein expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Compound 4 showed strong inhibition activity on NO production, and compounds 1 and 4 decreased the expression of iNOS mRNA and protein levels.
26332833	Comparative Effectiveness of Potential Elicitors of Plant Resistance against Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Four Crop Plants.	2015	PLoS One	Feeding by insect herbivores activates plant signaling pathways, resulting in the enhanced production of secondary metabolites and other resistance-related traits by injured plants. These traits can reduce insect fitness, deter feeding, and attract beneficial insects. Organic and inorganic chemicals applied as a foliar spray, seed treatment, or soil drench can activate these plant responses. Azelaic acid (AA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), gibberellic acid (GA), harpin, and jasmonic acid (JA) are thought to directly mediate plant responses to pathogens and herbivores or to mimic compounds that do. The effects of these potential elicitors on the induction of plant defenses were determined by measuring the weight gains of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (FAW) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae on four crop plants, cotton, corn, rice, and soybean, treated with the compounds under greenhouse conditions. Treatment with JA consistently reduced growth of FAW reared on treated cotton and soybean. In contrast, FAW fed BTH- and harpin-treated cotton and soybean tissue gained more weight than those fed control leaf tissue, consistent with negative crosstalk between the salicylic acid and JA signaling pathways. No induction or inconsistent induction of resistance was observed in corn and rice. Follow-up experiments showed that the co-application of adjuvants with JA failed to increase the effectiveness of induction by JA and that soybean looper [Chrysodeixis includens (Walker)], a relative specialist on legumes, was less affected by JA-induced responses in soybean than was the polyphagous FAW. Overall, the results of these experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of elicitors as a management tactic will depend strongly on the identities of the crop, the pest, and the elicitor involved.
26353816	Small-scale gene duplications played a major role in the recent evolution of wheat chromosome 3B.	2015	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: Bread wheat is not only an important crop, but its large (17 Gb), highly repetitive, and hexaploid genome makes it a good model to study the organization and evolution of complex genomes. Recently, we produced a high quality reference sequence of wheat chromosome 3B (774 Mb), which provides an excellent opportunity to study the evolutionary dynamics of a large and polyploid genome, specifically the impact of single gene duplications.

RESULTS: We find that 27 % of the 3B predicted genes are non-syntenic with the orthologous chromosomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, and Sorghum bicolor, whereas, by applying the same criteria, non-syntenic genes represent on average only 10 % of the predicted genes in these three model grasses. These non-syntenic genes on 3B have high sequence similarity to at least one other gene in the wheat genome, indicating that hexaploid wheat has undergone massive small-scale interchromosomal gene duplications compared to other grasses. Insertions of non-syntenic genes occurred at a similar rate along the chromosome, but these genes tend to be retained at a higher frequency in the distal, recombinogenic regions. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates showed a more relaxed selection pressure for non-syntenic genes compared to syntenic genes, and gene ontology analysis indicated that non-syntenic genes may be enriched in functions involved in disease resistance.

CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the major impact of single gene duplications on the wheat gene complement and confirm the accelerated evolution of the Triticeae lineage among grasses.
26348400	The polyamine oxidase from lycophyte Selaginella lepidophylla (SelPAO5), unlike that of angiosperms, back-converts thermospermine to norspermidine.	2015	FEBS Lett	In the phylogeny of plant polyamine oxidases (PAOs), clade III members from angiosperms, such as Arabidopsis thaliana PAO5 and Oryza sativa PAO1, prefer spermine and thermospermine as substrates and back-convert both of these substrates to spermidine in vitro. A clade III representative of lycophytes, SelPAO5 from Selaginella lepidophylla, also prefers spermine and thermospermine but instead back-converts these substrates to spermidine and norspermidine, respectively. This finding indicates that the clade III PAOs of lycophytes and angiosperms oxidize thermospermine at different carbon positions. We discuss the physiological significance of this difference.
26483837	Rice transcriptome analysis to identify possible herbicide quinclorac detoxification genes.	2015	Front Genet	Quinclorac is a highly selective auxin-type herbicide and is widely used in the effective control of barnyard grass in paddy rice fields, improving the world's rice yield. The herbicide mode of action of quinclorac has been proposed, and hormone interactions affecting quinclorac signaling has been identified. Because of widespread use, quinclorac may be transported outside rice fields with the drainage waters, leading to soil and water pollution and other environmental health problems. In this study, we used 57K Affymetrix rice whole-genome array to identify quinclorac signaling response genes to study the molecular mechanisms of action and detoxification of quinclorac in rice plants. Overall, 637 probe sets were identified with differential expression levels under either 6 or 24 h of quinclorac treatment. Auxin-related genes such as GH3 and OsIAAs responded to quinclorac treatment. Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes of detoxification-related family genes were significantly enriched, including cytochrome P450, GST, UGT, and ABC and drug transporter genes. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that top candidate genes of P450 families such as CYP81, CYP709C, and CYP72A were universally induced by different herbicides. Some Arabidopsis genes of the same P450 family were up-regulated under quinclorac treatment. We conducted rice whole-genome GeneChip analysis and the first global identification of quinclorac response genes. This work may provide potential markers for detoxification of quinclorac and biomonitors of environmental chemical pollution.

26416238	Binding interaction between rice glutelin and amylose: Hydrophobic interaction and conformational changes.	2015	Int J Biol Macromol	The interaction of rice glutelin (RG) with amylose was characterized by spectroscopic and molecular docking studies. The intrinsic fluorescence of RG increased upon the addition of amylose. The binding sites, binding constant and thermodynamic features indicated that binding process was spontaneous and the main driving force of the interaction was hydrophobic interaction. The surface hydrophobicity of RG decreased with increasing amount of amylose. Furthermore, synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra provided data concerning conformational and micro-environmental changes of RG. With the concentration of amylose increasing, the polarity around the tyrosine residues increased while the hydrophobicity decreased. Alteration of protein conformation was observed with increasing of α-helix and reducing of β-sheet. Finally, a visual representation of two binding sites located in the amorphous area of RG was presented by molecular modeling studies.
26566849	Improvement of Basmati rice varieties for resistance to blast and bacterial blight diseases using marker assisted backcross breeding.	2016	Plant Sci	Marker assisted backcross breeding was employed to incorporate the blast resistance genes, Pi2 and Pi54 and bacterial blight (BB) resistance genes xa13 and Xa21 into the genetic background of Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB1121) and Pusa Basmati 6. Foreground selection for target gene(s) was followed by arduous phenotypic and background selection which fast-tracked the recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG) to an extent of 95.8% in one of the near-isogenic lines (NILs) namely, Pusa 1728-23-33-31-56, which also showed high degree of resemblance to recurrent parent, PB6 in phenotype. The phenotypic selection prior to background selection provided an additional opportunity for identifying the novel recombinants viz., Pusa 1884-9-12-14 and Pusa 1884-3-9-175, superior to parental lines in terms of early maturity, higher yield and improved quality parameters. There was no significant difference between the RPG recovery estimated based on SSR or SNP markers, however, the panel of SNPs markers was considered as the better choice for background selection as it provided better genome coverage and included SNPs in the genic regions. Multi-location evaluation of NILs depicted their stable and high mean performance in comparison to the respective recurrent parents. The Pi2+Pi54 carrying NILs were effective in combating a pan-India panel of Magnaporthe oryzae isolates with high level of field resistance in northern, eastern and southern parts of India. Alongside, the PB1121-NILs and PB6-NILs carrying BB resistance genes xa13+Xa21 were resistant against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae races of north-western, southern and eastern parts of the country. Three of NILs developed in this study, have been promoted to final stage of testing during the ​Kharif 2015 in the Indian National Basmati Trial.
26382720	Aquaporin plays an important role in mediating chloroplastic CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under high-N supply in rice (Oryza sativa) plants.	2015	Physiol Plant	Our previous studies demonstrated that chloroplastic CO2 concentration (Cc) is not sufficient under high-nitrogen (N) supply in rice plants. In this research, we studied how aquaporins- (AQPs) mediated Cc under different N-supply levels. A hydroponic experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with three different N levels (low N, 0.71 mM; intermediate N, 2.86 mM; and high N, 7.14 mM) in a rice cultivar (Oryza sativa cv. Shanyou 63) and with an ospip1;1 mutant (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) decreased with increasing leaf-N content. Under high-N supply, the estimated Cc was significantly lower than the theoretical Cc and the specific Rubisco activity (carboxylation efficiency/Rubisco content, CE/Rubisco) decreased, because of a decrease of relative CO2 diffusion conductance (total CO2 diffusion conductance/leaf-N content, gt /N) in mesophyll cells. Real Time Quantitative PCR (Q-RT-PCR) showed that most OsPIP1s and OsPIP2s expression were downregulated under the high-N supply. Furthermore, Cc and gm decreased in the ospip1;1 mutant line compared with that of the wild-type plant. It was concluded that under high-N supply, the decreased PNUE was associated with non-sufficient Cc, mediated by AQP in mesophyll conductance.
26350634	Sustained low abscisic acid levels increase seedling vigor under cold stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Sci Rep	Stress-induced abscisic acid (ABA) is mainly catabolized by ABA 8'-hydroxylase (ABA8ox), which also strictly regulates endogenous ABA levels. Although three members of the ABA8ox gene family are conserved in rice, it is not clear which stressors induce expression of these genes. Here, we found that OsABA8ox1 was induced by cold stress within 24 h and that OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3 were not. In contrast, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3 were ABA-inducible, but OsABA8ox1 was not. OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2, and OsABA8ox3 restored germination of a cyp707a1/a2/a3 triple mutant of Arabidopsis to rates comparable to those of the wild type, indicating that OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2, and OsABA8ox3 function as ABA-catabolic genes in vivo. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsABA8ox1 showed decreased levels of ABA and increased seedling vigor at 15 °C. These results indicate that sustained low levels of ABA lead to increased seedling vigor during cold stress. On the other hand, excessively low endogenous ABA levels caused reduced drought and cold tolerance, although some of the transgenic rice lines expressing OsABA8ox1 at moderate levels did not show these harmful effects. Adequate regulation of endogenous ABA levels is thought to be crucial for maintaining seedling vigor under cold stress and for cold and drought tolerance in rice.
26419335	Transcriptome analysis of hormone-induced gene expression in Brachypodium distachyon.	2015	Sci Rep	Brachypodium distachyon is a new model plant closely related to wheat and other cereals. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of hormone-regulated genes in Brachypodium distachyon using RNA sequencing technology. Brachypodium distachyon seedlings were treated with eight phytohormones (auxin, cytokinine, brassinosteroid, gibberelline, abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonate and salicylic acid) and two inhibitors, Brz220 (brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) and prohexadione (gibberelline biosynthesis inhibitor). The expressions of 1807 genes were regulated in a phytohormone-dependent manner. We compared the data with the phytohormone responses that have reported in rice. Transcriptional responses to hormones are conserved between Bracypodium and rice. Transcriptional regulation by brassinosteroid, gibberellin and ethylene was relatively weaker than those by other hormones. This is consistent with the data obtained from comprehensive analysis of hormone responses reported in Arabidopsis. Brachypodium and Arabidopsis also shared some common transcriptional responses to phytohormones. Alternatively, unique transcriptional responses to phytohormones were observed in Brachypodium. For example, the expressions of ACC synthase genes were up-regulated by auxin treatment in rice and Arabidopsis, but no orthologous ACC synthase gene was up-regulated in Brachypodium. Our results provide information useful to understand the diversity and similarity of hormone-regulated transcriptional responses between eudicots and monocots.
26340891	2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline augmentation in scented indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties through Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) gene transformation.	2015	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) has been identified as a principal aroma compound in scented rice varieties. Δ(1)-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) gene is reported to regulate the proline synthesis in plants and acts as the precursor of 2AP. Two scented indica rice varieties, namely Ambemohar 157 and Indrayani, were subjected to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation containing P5CS gene. Overexpression of P5CS led to a significant increase in proline, P5CS enzyme activity and 2AP levels in transgenic calli, vegetative plant parts, and seeds over control in both the varieties. 2AP level increased more than twofold in transgenic seeds in both varieties. This is the first report of enhancement in 2AP content through overexpression of using P5CS gene, indicating the role of proline as a precursor amino acid in the biosynthesis of 2AP in scented rice.
26351309	Distinct Regulatory Changes Underlying Differential Expression of TEOSINTE BRANCHED1-CYCLOIDEA-PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR Genes Associated with Petal Variations in Zygomorphic Flowers of Petrocosmea spp. of the Family Gesneriaceae.	2015	Plant Physiol	CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like genes, belonging to the plant-specific TCP transcription factor family that is named after TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (TB1) from maize (Zea mays), CYC from Antirrhinum majus, and the PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS (PCF) from rice (Oryza sativa), have conserved dorsal identity function in patterning floral zygomorphy mainly through specific expression in dorsal petals of a flower. Their expression changes are usually related to morphological diversity of zygomorphic flowers. However, it is still a challenge to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying their expression differentiation. It is also unknown whether CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TCP genes, locally controlling cell growth and proliferation, are involved in the evolution of floral zygomorphy. To address these questions, we selected two closely related species, i.e. Petrocosmea glabristoma and Petrocosmea sinensis, with distinct petal morphology to conduct expression, hybridization, mutant, and allele-specific expression analyses. The results show that the size change of the dorsal petals between the two species is mainly mediated by the expression differentiation of CYC1C and CYC1D, while the shape variation of all petals is related to the expression change of CIN1. In reciprocal F1 hybrids, the expression of CYC1C, CYC1D, and CIN1 conforms to an additive inheritance mode, consistent with the petal phenotypes of hybrids. Through allele-specific expression analyses, we find that the expression differentiation of these TCP genes is underlain by distinctly different types of regulatory changes. We suggest that highly redundant paralogs with identical expression patterns and interspecific expression differentiation may be controlled by remarkably different regulatory pathways because natural selection may favor different regulatory modifications rather than coding sequence changes of key developmental genes in generating morphological diversity.
26334612	Genetic analysis for rice grain quality traits in the YVB stable variant line using RAD-seq.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	The future of rice breeding will likely be built on the basis of the further utilization of heterosis between elite cultivars and genetic resources from distant subspecies of rice. Previous studies have proved that exogenous genomic DNA transformation methods can be used to transfer genetic information from distant relatives (donor) into cultivated rice (recipient). However, the mechanism underlying this form of genetic transfer is poorly characterized, and the genes that cause the phenotypic changes in these variants are typically difficult to identify. This study examined YVB, a stable variant line with greatly improved grain quality traits that was derived from an indica variety (V20B) by transferring genomic DNA of O.minuta through the "spike-stalk injection method (SIM)". We used restriction-site associated DNA sequencing technology (RAD-seq) to evaluate a population of BC1F5 backcross lines (YVB × V20B); the RAD-seq data were used to construct a genetic linkage map with high-density SNPs for use in association analysis exploring genotype-phenotype relationships at the whole-genome level. A total of 17 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rice quality traits were mapped to chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. 8 major QTLs controlling different phenotypic variations were mapped to the same region of chromosome 5. This region contained the GS5 gene for grain weight and the qSW5/GW5 gene for grain width. This study provides new resources and insights into the molecular mechanisms of grain trait phenotypic variation and the transmission of genetic information via the introduction of genomic DNA to a distantly related crop relative species.
26366118	Rice tungro spherical virus resistance into photoperiod-insensitive japonica rice by marker-assisted selection.	2015	Breed Sci	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is one of the destructive and prevalent diseases in the tropical region. RTD is caused by Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus. Cultivation of japonica rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica) in tropical Asia has often been restricted because most japonica cultivars are sensitive to short photoperiod, which is characteristic of tropical conditions. Japonica1, a rice variety bred for tropical conditions, is photoperiod-insensitive, has a high yield potential, but is susceptible to RTD and has poor grain quality. To transfer RTD resistance into Japonica1, we made two backcrosses (BC) and 8 three-way crosses (3-WC) among Japonica1 and RTSV-resistant cultivars. Among 8,876 BC1F2 and 3-WCF2 plants, 342 were selected for photoperiod-insensitivity and good grain quality. Photoperiod-insensitive progenies were evaluated for RTSV resistance by a bioassay and marker-assisted selection (MAS), and 22 BC1F7 and 3-WCF7 lines were selected based on the results of an observational yield trial. The results demonstrated that conventional selection for photoperiod-insensitivity and MAS for RTSV resistance can greatly facilitate the development of japonica rice that is suitable for cultivation in tropical Asia.
26386366	Systematic analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) metabolic responses to herbivory.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Plants defend against attack from herbivores by direct and indirect defence mechanisms mediated by the accumulation of phytoalexins and release of volatile signals, respectively. While the defensive arsenals of some plants, such as tobacco and Arabidopsis are well known, most of rice's (Oryza sativa) defence metabolites and their effectiveness against herbivores remain uncharacterized. Here, we used a non-biassed metabolomics approach to identify many novel herbivory-regulated metabolic signatures in rice. Most were up-regulated by herbivore attack while only a few were suppressed. Two of the most prominent up-regulated signatures were characterized as phenolamides (PAs), p-coumaroylputrescine and feruloylputrescine. PAs accumulated in response to attack by both chewing insects, i.e. feeding of the lawn armyworm (Spodoptera mauritia) and the rice skipper (Parnara guttata) larvae, and the attack of the sucking insect, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens, BPH). In bioassays, BPH insects feeding on 15% sugar solution containing p-coumaroylputrescine or feruloylputrescine, at concentrations similar to those elicited by heavy BPH attack in rice, had a higher mortality compared to those feeding on sugar diet alone. Our results highlight PAs as a rapidly expanding new group of plant defence metabolites that are elicited by herbivore attack, and deter herbivores in rice and other plants.
26345976	Effects of silicon on seed setting rate of rice intersubspecific hybrids.	2015	Genet Mol Res	The present study found semi-sterility in rice intersubspecific hybrids of 'Taichung 65' x 'Guangluai 4' and 'Ludao' x 'Qiuguang'. Embryo sac fertility was evaluated using the overall staining transparent method. The results showed that the embryo sac contained a normal egg cell, normal synergid cells, polar nuclei cells, and antipodal cells, indicating that semi-sterility was caused mainly by pollen semi-sterility. In the pot experiment, the effects of silicon on the seed-setting rate of the two intersubspecific hybrids were examined. The results showed that the rate of anther dehiscence, number of pollen per stigma of Fl plants, potential of pollen grain germination, and fertility of the spikelet were significantly improved by the utilization of silicon fertilizer.
26566831	Construction of a versatile SNP array for pyramiding useful genes of rice.	2016	Plant Sci	DNA marker-assisted selection (MAS) has become an indispensable component of breeding. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are the most frequent polymorphism in the rice genome. However, SNP markers are not readily employed in MAS because of limitations in genotyping platforms. Here the authors report a Golden Gate SNP array that targets specific genes controlling yield-related traits and biotic stress resistance in rice. As a first step, the SNP genotypes were surveyed in 31 parental varieties using the Affymetrix Rice 44K SNP microarray. The haplotype information for 16 target genes was then converted to the Golden Gate platform with 143-plex markers. Haplotypes for the 14 useful allele are unique and can discriminate among all other varieties. The genotyping consistency between the Affymetrix microarray and the Golden Gate array was 92.8%, and the accuracy of the Golden Gate array was confirmed in 3 F2 segregating populations. The concept of the haplotype-based selection by using the constructed SNP array was proofed.
26403240	Evaluation of changes induced in rice metabolome by Cd and Cu exposure using LC-MS with XCMS and MCR-ALS data analysis strategies.	2015	Anal Bioanal Chem	The comprehensive analysis of untargeted metabolomics data acquired using LC-MS is still a major challenge. Different data analysis tools have been developed in recent years such as XCMS (various forms (X) of chromatography mass spectrometry) and multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS)-based strategies. In this work, metabolites extracted from rice tissues cultivated in an environmental test chamber were subjected to untargeted full-scan LC-MS analysis, and the obtained data sets were analyzed using XCMS and MCR-ALS. These approaches were compared in the investigation of the effects of copper and cadmium exposure on rice tissue (roots and aerial parts) samples. Both methods give, as a result of their application, the whole set of resolved elution and spectra profiles of the extracted metabolites in control and metal-treated samples, as well as the values of their corresponding chromatographic peak areas. The effects caused by the two considered metals on rice samples were assessed by further chemometric analysis and statistical evaluation of these peak area values. Results showed that there was a statistically significant interaction between the considered factors (type of metal of treatment and tissue). Also, the discrimination of the samples according to both factors was possible. A tentative identification of the most discriminant metabolites (biomarkers) was assessed. It is finally concluded that both XCMS- and MCR-ALS-based strategies provided similar results in all the considered cases despite the completely different approaches used by these two methods in the chromatographic peak resolution and detection strategies. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of using these two methods are discussed. Graphical Abstract Summary of the workflow for untargeted metabolomics using the compared approaches.
26335702	Small RNAs and Gene Network in a Durable Disease Resistance Gene--Mediated Defense Responses in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Accumulating data have suggested that small RNAs (sRNAs) have important functions in plant responses to pathogen invasion. However, it is largely unknown whether and how sRNAs are involved in the regulation of rice responses to the invasion of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, the most devastating bacterial disease of rice worldwide. We performed simultaneous genome-wide analyses of the expression of sRNAs and genes during early defense responses of rice to Xoo mediated by a major disease resistance gene, Xa3/Xa26, which confers durable and race-specific qualitative resistance. A large number of sRNAs and genes showed differential expression in Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance. These differentially expressed sRNAs include known microRNAs (miRNAs), unreported miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs. The candidate genes, with expression that was negatively correlated with the expression of sRNAs, were identified, indicating that these genes may be regulated by sRNAs in disease resistance in rice. These results provide a new perspective regarding the putative roles of sRNA candidates and their putative target genes in durable disease resistance in rice.
26483798	Molecular marker assisted gene stacking for biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes in an elite rice cultivar.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Severe yield loss due to various biotic stresses like bacterial blight (BB), gall midge (insect) and Blast (disease) and abiotic stresses like submergence and salinity are a serious constraint to the rice productivity throughout the world. The most effective and reliable method of management of the stresses is the enhancement of host resistance, through an economical and environmentally friendly approach. Through the application of marker assisted selection (MAS) technique, the present study reports a successful pyramidization of genes/QTLs to confer resistance/tolerance to blast (Pi2, Pi9), gall Midge (Gm1, Gm4), submergence (Sub1), and salinity (Saltol) in a released rice variety CRMAS2621-7-1 as Improved Lalat which had already incorporated with three BB resistance genes xa5, xa13, and Xa21 to supplement the Xa4 gene present in Improved Lalat. The molecular analysis revealed clear polymorphism between the donor and recipient parents for all the markers that are tagged to the target traits. The conventional backcross breeding approach was followed till BC3F1 generation and starting from BC1F1 onwards, marker assisted selection was employed at each step to monitor the transfer of the target alleles with molecular markers. The different BC3F1s having the target genes/QTLs were inter crossed to generate hybrids with all 10 stress resistance/tolerance genes/QTLs into a single plant/line. Homozygous plants for resistance/tolerance genes in different combinations were recovered. The BC3F3 lines were characterized for their agronomic and quality traits and promising progeny lines were selected. The SSR based background selection was done. Most of the gene pyramid lines showed a high degree of similarity to the recurrent parent for both morphological, grain quality traits and in SSR based background selection. Out of all the gene pyramids tested, two lines had all the 10 resistance/tolerance genes and showed adequate levels of resistance/tolerance against the five target stresses. The study demonstrates the potential of MAS for stacking of several genes into a single line with a high degree of parental genome recovery.
26407850	Glutamine rapidly induces the expression of key transcription factor genes involved in nitrogen and stress responses in rice roots.	2015	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Glutamine is a major amino donor for the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and other nitrogen-containing compounds in all organisms. In addition to its role in nutrition and metabolism, glutamine can also function as a signaling molecule in bacteria, yeast, and humans. By contrast, the functions of glutamine in nutrition and as a signaling molecule remain unclear in plants.

RESULTS: We demonstrated that glutamine could effectively support the growth of rice seedlings. In glutamine-treated rice roots, the glutamine contents increased dramatically, whereas levels of glutamate remained relatively constant. Transcriptome analysis of rice roots revealed that glutamine induced the expression of at least 35 genes involved in metabolism, transport, signal transduction, and stress responses within 30 min. Interestingly, 10 of the 35 early glutamine responsive genes encode putative transcription factors, including two LBD37-like genes that are involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism. Glutamine also rapidly induced the expression of the DREB1A, IRO2, and NAC5 transcription factor genes, which are involved in the regulation of stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its role as a metabolic fuel, glutamine may also function as a signaling molecule to regulate gene expression in plants. The rapid induction of transcription factor genes suggests that glutamine may efficiently amplify its signal and interact with the other signal transduction pathways to regulate plant growth and stress responses. Thus, glutamine is a functional amino acid that plays important roles in plant nutrition and signal transduction.
26366117	Distorted genetic segregation of the transposon mPing at the long arm of chromosome 12 in rice.	2015	Breed Sci	A class II transposable element, mPing exists in the rice genome ubiquitously and can transpose even in ordinary cultivation conditions. A copy of mPing was identified at the long arm of chromosome 12. In reciprocal backcrossed F1s between a heterozygote and a homozygote without mPing, the male gametes with this mPing from heterozygotes were transmitted to the next generation at a lower frequency than those without mPing, resulting in distorted genetic segregation in self-fertilized progenies, as well as in F1s after backcrossing. Pollens with mPing tended to germinate on stigma less than those without mPing. These results, however, could not explain the lower transmission of male gametes with mPing. In addition, no excision of mPing was observed in a homozygote. Thus, it was suggested that male gametes with mPing were eliminated partly from pollination to fertilization by negative competition against male gametes without mPing. Less formation of microspores with mPing in meiosis could also be a cause for the distorted segregation, although this could not be examined. At least two ORFs, whose functions have not been identified, are located near this mPing. It is plausible that either of these ORFs or both are necessary for the normal functioning of male gametes.
26369652	The development and status of Bt rice in China.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Multiple lines of transgenic rice expressing insecticidal genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been developed in China, posing the prospect of increases in production with decreased application of pesticides. We explore the issues facing adoption of Bt rice for commercial production in China. A body of safety assessment work on Bt rice has shown that Bt rice poses a negligible risk to the environment and that Bt rice products are as safe as non-Bt control rice products as food. China has a relatively well-developed regulatory system for risk assessment and management of genetically modified (GM) plants; however, decision-making regarding approval of commercial production has become politicized, and two Bt rice lines that otherwise were ready have not been allowed to enter the Chinese agricultural system. We predict that Chinese farmers would value the prospect of increased yield with decreased use of pesticide and would readily adopt production of Bt rice. That Bt rice lines may not be commercialized in the near future we attribute to social pressures, largely due to the low level of understanding and acceptance of GM crops by Chinese consumers. Hence, enhancing communication of GM crop science-related issues to the public is an important, unmet need. While the dynamics of each issue are particular to China, they typify those in many countries where adoption of GM crops has been not been rapid; hence, the assessment of these dynamics might inform resolution of these issues in other countries.
26484259	Simple and efficient way to detect small polymorphic bands in plants.	2015	Genom Data	There are many ways to detect polymorphism. In this study we use the microsatellite markers to detect the polymorphism for the salt tolerance. This method has been successfully conducted in Oryza sativa and Brassica juncea. The results are reproducible. In contrast to previous methods, our method is simple and quite accurate for detecting the polymorphic bands. In this study instead of using agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining, we used non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and a low-cost improved method for silver staining when we compare it to 11 other methods for their ability to detect simple sequence repeat polymorphisms as small as 50 bp in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. All methods detected the same alleles and banding pattern. However, important differences in sensitivity, contrast, time consumption and background were observed.
26566836	Both Hd1 and Ehd1 are important for artificial selection of flowering time in cultivated rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Rice is a facultative short-day plant, and it requires a photoperiod shorter than the critical day length to get flowering. Sensitivity to photoperiod has been suggested as a major selection target in cultivated or weedy rice. The modern rice varieties in Taiwan may be cultivated twice a year. These varieties contain loss-of-function of two important flowering-time related genes, Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), and are mainly from a mega variety, Taichung 65. However, the parental lines of this variety were sensitive to photoperiod, thus, how Taichung 65 loss its sensitivity is a mystery. In this study, we used accession-specific single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to reveal the gene flow that occurred between different rice accessions decades ago and demonstrate that two landraces introgressed during the breeding process, which led to the loss of photoperiod sensitivity. Both Hd1 and Ehd1 may be important during artificial selection for flowering time, especially in a subtropical region such as Taiwan. This is a good example of introgression playing important roles during rice domestication.
26566846	Improving salt tolerance of lowland rice cultivar 'Rassi' through marker-aided backcross breeding in West Africa.	2016	Plant Sci	Salt stress affects about 25% of the 4.4 million ha of irrigated and lowland systems for rice cultivation in West Africa (WA). A major quantitative trait locus (QTLs) on chromosome 1 (Saltol) that enhances tolerance to salt stress at the vegetative stage has enabled the use of marker-assisted selection (MAS) to develop salt-tolerant rice cultivar(s) in WA. We used 3 cycles of backcrossing with selection based on DNA markers and field-testing using 'FL478' as tolerant donor and the widely grown 'Rassi' as recurrent parent. In the BC3F2 stage, salt-tolerant lines with over 80% Rassi alleles except in the region around Saltol segment were selected. 429 introgression lines (Saltol-ILs) were identified as tolerant at vegetative stage, of which 116 were field-tested for four seasons at the reproductive stage. Sixteen Saltol-ILs had less yield loss (3-26% relative to control trials), and 8 Saltol-ILs showed high yield potential under stress and non-stress conditions. The 16 Saltol-ILs had been included for further African-wide testing prior to release in 6 WA countries. MAS reduced the time for germplasm improvement from at least 7 to about 4 years. Our objective is to combine different genes/QTLs conferring tolerance to stresses under one genetic background using MAS.
26356220	Biallelic and Genome Wide Association Mapping of Germanium Tolerant Loci in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Rice plants accumulate high concentrations of silicon. Silicon has been shown to be involved in plant growth, high yield, and mitigating biotic and abiotic stresses. However, it has been demonstrated that inorganic arsenic is taken up by rice through silicon transporters under anaerobic conditions, thus the ability to efficiently take up silicon may be considered either a positive or a negative trait in rice. Germanium is an analogue of silicon that produces brown lesions in shoots and leaves, and germanium toxicity has been used to identify mutants in silicon and arsenic transport. In this study, two different genetic mapping methods were performed to determine the loci involved in germanium sensitivity in rice. Genetic mapping in the biparental cross of Bala × Azucena (an F6 population) and a genome wide association (GWA) study with 350 accessions from the Rice Diversity Panel 1 were conducted using 15 μM of germanic acid. This identified a number of germanium sensitive loci: some co-localised with previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tissue silicon or arsenic concentration, none co-localised with Lsi1 or Lsi6, while one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected within 200 kb of Lsi2 (these are genes known to transport silicon, whose identity was discovered using germanium toxicity). However, examining candidate genes that are within the genomic region of the loci detected above reveals genes homologous to both Lsi1 and Lsi2, as well as a number of other candidate genes, which are discussed.
26378525	Metabolite Profiling of Diverse Rice Germplasm and Identification of Conserved Metabolic Markers of Rice Roots in Response to Long-Term Mild Salinity Stress.	2015	Int J Mol Sci	The sensitivity of rice to salt stress greatly depends on growth stages, organ types and cultivars. Especially, the roots of young rice seedlings are highly salt-sensitive organs that limit plant growth, even under mild soil salinity conditions. In an attempt to identify metabolic markers of rice roots responding to salt stress, metabolite profiling was performed by ¹H-NMR spectroscopy in 38 rice genotypes that varied in biomass accumulation under long-term mild salinity condition. Multivariate statistical analysis showed separation of the control and salt-treated rice roots and rice genotypes with differential growth potential. By quantitative analyses of ¹H-NMR data, five conserved salt-responsive metabolic markers of rice roots were identified. Sucrose, allantoin and glutamate accumulated by salt stress, whereas the levels of glutamine and alanine decreased. A positive correlation of metabolite changes with growth potential and salt tolerance of rice genotypes was observed for allantoin and glutamine. Adjustment of nitrogen metabolism in rice roots is likely to be closely related to maintain the growth potential and increase the stress tolerance of rice.
26395408	Proteomic analysis of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in rice seeds.	2015	Sci Rep	The defects in storage proteins secretion in the endosperm of transgenic rice seeds often leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which produces floury and shrunken seeds, but the mechanism of this response remains unclear. We used an iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis of ER-stressed rice seeds due to the endosperm-specific suppression of OsSar1 to identify changes in the protein levels in response to ER stress. ER stress changed the expression of 405 proteins in rice seed by >2.0- fold compared with the wild-type control. Of these proteins, 140 were upregulated and 265 were downregulated. The upregulated proteins were mainly involved in protein modification, transport and degradation, and the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in metabolism and stress/defense responses. A KOBAS analysis revealed that protein-processing in the ER and degradation-related proteasome were the predominant upregulated pathways in the rice endosperm in response to ER stress. Trans-Golgi protein transport was also involved in the ER stress response. Combined with bioinformatic and molecular biology analyses, our proteomic data will facilitate our understanding of the systemic responses to ER stress in rice seeds.
17984200	Genome-wide annotation of remorins, a plant-specific protein family: evolutionary and functional perspectives.	2007	Plant Physiol	
20807878	Arabidopsis VILLIN1 and VILLIN3 have overlapping and distinct activities in actin bundle formation and turnover.	2010	Plant Cell	Actin filament bundles are higher-order cytoskeletal structures that are crucial for the maintenance of cellular architecture and cell expansion. They are generated from individual actin filaments by the actions of bundling proteins like fimbrins, LIMs, and villins. However, the molecular mechanisms of dynamic bundle formation and turnover are largely unknown. Villins belong to the villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily and comprise at least five isovariants in Arabidopsis thaliana. Different combinations of villin isovariants are coexpressed in various tissues and cells. It is not clear whether these isovariants function together and act redundantly or whether they have unique activities. VILLIN1 (VLN1) is a simple filament-bundling protein and is Ca(2+) insensitive. Based on phylogenetic analyses and conservation of Ca(2+) binding sites, we predict that VLN3 is a Ca(2+)-regulated villin capable of severing actin filaments and contributing to bundle turnover. The bundling activity of both isovariants was observed directly with time-lapse imaging and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in vitro, and the mechanism mimics the "catch and zipper" action observed in vivo. Using time-lapse TIRF microscopy, we observed and quantified the severing of individual actin filaments by VLN3 at physiological calcium concentrations. Moreover, VLN3 can sever actin filament bundles in the presence of VLN1 when calcium is elevated to micromolar levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that two villin isovariants have overlapping and distinct activities.
22431979	Membrane topology and predicted RNA-binding function of the 'early responsive to dehydration (ERD4)' plant protein.	2012	PLoS One	Functional annotation of uncharacterized genes is the main focus of computational methods in the post genomic era. These tools search for similarity between proteins on the premise that those sharing sequence or structural motifs usually perform related functions, and are thus particularly useful for membrane proteins. Early responsive to dehydration (ERD) genes are rapidly induced in response to dehydration stress in a variety of plant species. In the present work we characterized function of Brassica juncea ERD4 gene using computational approaches. The ERD4 protein of unknown function possesses ubiquitous DUF221 domain (residues 312-634) and is conserved in all plant species. We suggest that the protein is localized in chloroplast membrane with at least nine transmembrane helices. We detected a globular domain of 165 amino acid residues (183-347) in plant ERD4 proteins and expect this to be posited inside the chloroplast. The structural-functional annotation of the globular domain was arrived at using fold recognition methods, which suggested in its sequence presence of two tandem RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains each folded into βαββαβ topology. The structure based sequence alignment with the known RNA-binding proteins revealed conservation of two non-canonical ribonucleoprotein sub-motifs in both the putative RNA-recognition domains of the ERD4 protein. The function of highly conserved ERD4 protein may thus be associated with its RNA-binding ability during the stress response. This is the first functional annotation of ERD4 family of proteins that can be useful in designing experiments to unravel crucial aspects of stress tolerance mechanism.
15002667	Isolation and characterization of a novel rice gene encoding a putative insect-inducible protein homologous to wheat Wir1.	2004	J Plant Physiol	A full-length cDNA, designated BpHi008A, was cloned representing a rice (Oryza sativa) mRNA that accumulates after brown planthopper (BPH) Nilapar vata lugens Stål feeding. The cDNA encodes a putative 82 amino acid protein (BpHi008A) exhibiting about 37% amino acid sequence identity to Wir1 family of proteins that are encoded by pathogen-induced transcripts in wheat. Like Wir1 proteins, it consists of a hydrophobic N-terminal half and a hydrophilic C-terminal half relatively rich in glycine and proline. These proteins are predicted to be integrated into the membrane, with the C-terminus being extracytoplastic. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that the BpHi008A gene was present as a single-copy sequence in the rice genome. Temporal and spatial studies showed that BpHi008A were systemically induced in rice when 2nd and 3rd-instars were feeding. The BpHi008A transcripts level was also increased in seedlings damaged by mechanical wounding. These data indicated that BphHi008A was implicated in the response of rice plants to BPH feeding and wounding.
23826294	Abscisic Acid Promotes Susceptibility to the Rice Leaf Blight Pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae by Suppressing Salicylic Acid-Mediated Defenses.	2013	PLoS One	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in a wide variety of plant processes, including the initiation of stress-adaptive responses to various environmental cues. Recently, ABA also emerged as a central factor in the regulation and integration of plant immune responses, although little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Aiming to advance our understanding of ABA-modulated disease resistance, we have analyzed the impact, dynamics and interrelationship of ABA and the classic defense hormone salicylic acid (SA) during progression of rice infection by the leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Consistent with ABA negatively regulating resistance to Xoo, we found that exogenously administered ABA renders rice hypersusceptible to infection, whereas chemical and genetic disruption of ABA biosynthesis and signaling, respectively, led to enhanced Xoo resistance. In addition, we found successful Xoo infection to be associated with extensive reprogramming of ABA biosynthesis and response genes, suggesting that ABA functions as a virulence factor for Xoo. Interestingly, several lines of evidence indicate that this immune-suppressive effect of ABA is due at least in part to suppression of SA-mediated defenses that normally serve to limit pathogen growth. Resistance induced by the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone, however, appears to operate in a SA-independent manner and is likely due to induction of non-specific physiological stress. Collectively, our findings favor a scenario whereby virulent Xoo hijacks the rice ABA machinery to cause disease and highlight the importance of ABA and its crosstalk with SA in shaping the outcome of rice-Xoo interactions.
16942608	AtEXO70A1, a member of a family of putative exocyst subunits specifically expanded in land plants, is important for polar growth and plant development.	2006	Plant J	The exocyst is a hetero-oligomeric protein complex involved in exocytosis and has been extensively studied in yeast and animal cells. Evidence is now accumulating that the exocyst is also present in plants. Bioinformatic analysis of genes encoding plant homologs of the exocyst subunit, Exo70, revealed that three Exo70 subgroups are evolutionarily conserved among angiosperms, lycophytes and mosses. Arabidopsis and rice contain 22 and approximately 39 EXO70 genes, respectively, which can be classified into nine clusters considered to be ancient in angiosperms (one has been lost in Arabidopsis). We characterized two independent T-DNA insertional mutants of the AtEXO70A1 gene (exo70A1-1 and exo70A1-2). Heterozygous EXO70A1/exo70A1 plants appear to be normal and segregate in a 1:2:1 ratio, suggesting that neither male nor female gametophytes are affected by the EXO70A1 disruption. However, both exo70A1-1 and exo70A1-2 homozygotes exhibit an array of phenotypic defects. The polar growth of root hairs and stigmatic papillae is disturbed. Organs are generally smaller, plants show a loss of apical dominance and indeterminate growth where instead of floral meristems new lateral inflorescences are initiated in a reiterative manner. Both exo70A1 mutants have dramatically reduced fertility. These results suggest that the putative exocyst subunit EXO70A1 is involved in cell and organ morphogenesis.
22826714	Evolution of the land plant exocyst complexes.	2012	Front Plant Sci	Exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved vesicle tethering complex functioning especially in the last stage of exocytosis. Homologs of its eight canonical subunits - Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 - were found also in higher plants and confirmed to form complexes in vivo, and to participate in cell growth including polarized expansion of pollen tubes and root hairs. Here we present results of a phylogenetic study of land plant exocyst subunits encoded by a selection of completely sequenced genomes representing a variety of plant, mostly angiosperm, lineages. According to their evolution histories, plant exocyst subunits can be divided into several groups. The core subunits Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10, together with Sec3 and Sec5, underwent few, if any fixed duplications in the tracheophytes (though they did amplify in the moss Physcomitrella patens), while others form larger families, with the number of paralogs ranging typically from two to eight per genome (Sec15, Exo84) to several dozens per genome (Exo70). Most of the diversity, which can be in some cases traced down to the origins of land plants, can be attributed to the peripheral subunits Exo84 and, in particular, Exo70. As predicted previously, early land plants (including possibly also the Rhyniophytes) encoded three ancestral Exo70 paralogs which further diversified in the course of land plant evolution. Our results imply that plants do not have a single "Exocyst complex" - instead, they appear to possess a diversity of exocyst variants unparalleled among other organisms studied so far. This feature might perhaps be directly related to the demands of building and maintenance of the complicated and spatially diverse structures of the endomembranes and cell surfaces in multicellular land plants.
23275578	The promiscuous life of plant NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors.	2012	Plant Cell	The CCAAT box is one of the most common cis-elements present in eukaryotic promoters and is bound by the transcription factor NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y). NF-Y is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. Unlike animals and fungi, plants have significantly expanded the number of genes encoding NF-Y subunits. We provide a comprehensive classification of NF-Y genes, with a separation of closely related, but distinct, histone fold domain proteins. We additionally review recent experiments that have placed NF-Y at the center of many developmental stress-responsive processes in the plant lineage.
9744098	Low-oxygen stress and water deficit induce cytosolic pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) expression in roots of rice, a C3 plant.	1998	Plant J	Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is known for its role in C4 photosynthesis but has no established function in C3 plants. Abscisic acid, PEG and submergence were found to markedly induce a protein of about 97 kDa, identified by microsequencing as PPDK, in rice roots (C3). The rice genome was found to contain two ppdk loci, osppdka and osppdkb. We isolated osppdka cDNA, which encodes a cytosolic rice PPDK isoform of 96.6 kDa, that corresponded to the ABA-induced protein from roots. Western blot analysis showed a PPDK induction in roots of rice seedlings during gradual drying, cold, high salt and mannitol treatment, indicating a water deficit response. PPDK was also induced in the roots and sheath of submerged rice seedlings, and in etiolated rice seedlings exposed to an oxygen-free N2 atmosphere, which indicated a low-oxygen stress response. None of the stress treatments induced PPDK protein accumulation in the lamina of green rice seedlings. Ppdk transcripts were found to accumulate in roots of submerged seedlings, concomitant with the induction of alcohol dehydrogenase 1. Low-oxygen stress triggered an increase in PPDK activity in roots and etiolated rice seedlings, accompanied by increases in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase activities. The results indicate that cytosolic PPDK is involved in a metabolic response to water deficit and low-oxygen stress in rice, an anoxia-tolerant species.
23220941	Genetic and physiological analysis of a novel type of interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	Hybrid weakness is an important reproductive barrier that hinders genetic exchange between different species at the post-zygotic stage. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid weakness is limited. In this study, we report discovery of a novel interspecific hybrid weakness in a rice chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) library derived from a cross between the indica variety Teqing (Oryza sativa) and common wild rice (O. rufipogon). The dominant Hybrid weakness i1 (Hwi1) gene from wild rice is genetically incompatible with Teqing and induced a set of weakness symptoms, including growth suppression, yield decrease, impaired nutrient absorption, and the retardation of crown root initiation. Phytohormone treatment showed that salicylic acid (SA) could restore the height of plants expressing hybrid weakness, while other phytohormones appear to have little effect. Fine mapping indicated that Hwi1 is located in a tandem leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) gene cluster. Within the 13.2-kb candidate region on the short arm of chromosome 11, there are two annotated LRR-RLK genes, LOC_Os11g07230 and LOC_Os11g07240. The Teqing allele of LOC_Os11g07230 and the wild rice allele of LOC_Os11g07240 encode predicted functional proteins. Based on the genetic inheritance of hybrid weakness, LOC_Os11g07240 is implicated as the candidate gene for Hwi1. Functional analysis of Hwi1 will expand our knowledge of the regulation of hybrid weakness in rice.
18507773	Sex-independent transmission ratio distortion system responsible for reproductive barriers between Asian and African rice species.	2008	New Phytol	* A sex-independent transmission ratio distortion (siTRD) system detected in the interspecific cross in rice was analyzed in order to understand its significance in reproductive barriers. The S(1) gene, derived from African rice Oryza glaberrima, induced preferential abortion of both male and female gametes possessing its allelic alternative (), from Asian rice O. sativa, only in the heterozygote. * The siTRD was characterized by resolving it into mTRD and fTRD occurring through male and female gametes, respectively, cytological analysis of gametophyte development, and mapping of the S(1) locus using near-isogenic lines. The allelic distribution of the S(1) locus in Asian and African rice species complexes was also analyzed. * The siTRD system involved at least two components affecting male and female gametogeneses, respectively, including a modifier(s) that enhances fTRD. The chromosomal location of the major component causing the mTRD was delimited within an approx. 40 kb region. The S(1) locus induced hybrid sterility in any pairwise combination between Asian and African rice species complexes. * The allelic state of the S(1) locus has diverged between Asian and African rice species complexes, suggesting that the TRD system has a significant role in the reproductive barriers in rice.
15084732	The GATA family of transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice.	2004	Plant Physiol	GATA transcription factors are a group of DNA binding proteins broadly distributed in eukaryotes. The GATA factors DNA binding domain is a class IV zinc finger motif in the form CX(2)CX(17-20)CX(2)C followed by a basic region. In plants, GATA DNA motifs have been implicated in light-dependent and nitrate-dependent control of transcription. Herein, we show that the Arabidopsis and the rice (Oryza sativa) genomes present 29 and 28 loci, respectively, that encode for putative GATA factors. A phylogenetic analysis of the 57 GATA factors encoding genes, as well as the study of their intron-exon structure, indicates the existence of seven subfamilies of GATA genes. Some of these subfamilies are represented in both species but others are exclusive for one of them. In addition to the GATA zinc finger motif, polypeptides of the different subfamilies are characterized by the presence of additional domains such as an acidic domain, a CCT (CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1) domain, or a transposase-like domain also found in FAR1 and FHY3. Subfamily VI comprises genes that encode putative bi-zinc finger polypeptides, also found in metazoan and fungi, and a tri-zinc finger protein which has not been previously reported in eukaryotes. The phylogeny of the GATA zinc finger motif, excluding flanking regions, evidenced the existence of four classes of GATA zinc fingers, three of them containing 18 residues in the zinc finger loop and one containing a 20-residue loop. Our results support multiple models of evolution of the GATA gene family in plants including gene duplication and exon shuffling.
18676621	Gene expression and sensitivity in response to copper stress in rice leaves.	2008	J Exp Bot	Gene expression in response to Cu stress in rice leaves was quantified using DNA microarray (Agilent 22K Rice Oligo Microarray) and real-time PCR technology. Rice plants were grown in hydroponic solutions containing 0.3 (control), 10, 45, or 130 microM of CuCl(2), and Cu accumulation and photosynthesis inhibition were observed in leaves within 1 d of the start of treatment. Microarray analysis flagged 305 Cu-responsive genes, and their expression profile showed that a large proportion of general and defence stress response genes are up-regulated under excess Cu conditions, whereas photosynthesis and transport-related genes are down-regulated. The Cu sensitivity of each Cu-responsive gene was estimated by the median effective concentration value (EC50) and the range of fold-changes (F) under the highest (130 microM) Cu conditions (|log(2)F|(130)). Our results indicate that defence-related genes involved in phytoalexin and lignin biosynthesis were the most sensitive to Cu, and that plant management of abiotic and pathogen stresses has overlapping components, possibly including signal transduction.
15605239	Identification and fine mapping of a mutant gene for palealess spikelet in rice.	2005	Planta	In grass, the evolutionary relationship between lemma and palea, and their relationship to the flower organs in dicots have been variously interpreted and wildely debated. In the present study, we carried out morphological and genetic analysis of a palealess mutant (pal) from rice (Oryza sativa L.), and fine mapping the gene responsible for the mutated trait. Together, our findings indicate that the palea is replaced by two leaf-like structures in the pal flowers, and this trait is controlled by one recessive gene, termed palealess1 (pal1). With a large F2 segregating population, the pal1 gene was finally mapped into a physical region of 35 kb. Our results also suggest that the lemma and palea of rice are not homologous organs, palea is likely evolutionarily equivalent to the eudicot sepal, and the pal1 should be an A function gene for rice floral organ identity.
23603966	Characterization of a nitrate-inducible transcriptional repressor NIGT1 provides new insights into DNA recognition by the GARP family proteins.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The GARP domain is a single Myb-related DNA-binding domain found in plant transcription factors. Proteins containing the GARP domain (GARP family proteins) are suggested to be involved in the regulation of various physiological processes through their interactions with ostensibly different DNA sequences. Our recent study on a nitrate-inducible gene encoding a GARP family protein, referred to as NIGT1 (Nitrate-Inducible, GARP-type Transcriptional Repressor 1), not only suggests a previously unidentified role for the GARP family proteins in higher plants but also provides a hypothesis for why NIGT1 can show dual specificity on DNA binding and why respective GARP family proteins can recognize very different DNA sequences.
17284836	Expression of rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare) alpha-galactosidase genes in Escherichia coli and characterization.	2007	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Two putative alpha-galactosidase genes from rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 27 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. These enzymes showed alpha-galactosidase activity and were purified by Ni Sepharose column chromatography. Two purified recombinant alpha-galactosidases (alpha-galactosidase II and III; alpha-Gal II and III) showed a single protein band on SDS-PAGE with molecular mass of 42 kDa. These two enzymes cleaved not only alpha-D-galactosyl residues from the non-reducing end of substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose, but also liberated the galactosyl residues attached to the O-6 position of the mannosyl residue at the reducing-ends of mannobiose and mannotriose. In addition, these enzymes clipped the galactosyl residues attached to the inner-mannosyl residues of mannopentaose. Thus, alpha-Gal II catalyzes efficient degalactosylation of galactomannans, such as guar gum and locust bean gum.
16041362	Architecture of floral branch systems in maize and related grasses.	2005	Nature	The external appearance of flowering plants is determined to a large extent by the forms of flower-bearing branch systems, known as inflorescences, and their position in the overall structure of the plant. Branches and branching patterns are produced by tissues called shoot apical meristems. Thus, inflorescence architecture reflects meristem number, arrangement and activity, and the duration of meristem activity correlates with branch length. The inflorescences of maize, unlike those of related grasses such as rice and sorghum, predominantly lack long branches, giving rise to the tassel and familiar corncob. Here we report the isolation of the maize ramosa1 gene and show that it controls inflorescence architecture. Through its expression in a boundary domain near the nascent meristem base, ramosa1 imposes short branch identity as branch meristems are initiated. A second gene, ramosa2, acts through ramosa1 by regulating ramosa1 gene expression levels. ramosa1 encodes a transcription factor that appears to be absent in rice, is heterochronically expressed in sorghum, and may have played an important role in maize domestication and grass evolution.
16132843	Differential expression of three 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose-5-phosphate synthase genes in rice.	2005	Biotechnol Lett	1-Deoxy-D-: xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) encoded by a multigene family in plants, catalyzes the first step in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Three rice DXS-related sequences (OsDXS) were identified from available rice databases. The open reading frame of three OsDXS genes (dxs1, dxs2, and dxs3) were amplified against cDNA template. Ratio of their transcript levels in etiolated rice leaf was 9:181:1. While the expression levels were not changed along the growth stages of etiolated culture, UV-irradiation of the etiolated rice induced the expression of dxs3 up to nine-fold compared with that of unirradiated control. In the case of light-illumination, the relative expression of dxs1 based on unilluminated control increased two-fold. The differential expression of three OsDXS genes suggested their distinct and complementary roles in the control of the first step of the MEP pathway in response to environmental stimuli.
10945348	Specific accumulation of polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters in the cell walls of irregularly shaped and collapsed internode parenchyma cells of the dwarf rice mutant Fukei 71.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	We examined a novel rice mutant, Fukei 71 (Oryza sativa L.), for alterations in the levels of hydroxycinnamoyl esters that are linked to cell wall polysaccharides and lignin units. In this mutant, a recessive mutation at a single locus caused the collapse of parenchyma cells in the internodes. Light microscopy revealed that the abnormal walls of internode parenchyma cells of Fukei 71 were stained by the Mäule reaction, which is specific for syringyl units in phenolic compounds. These walls were not stained by Wiesner's reagent (phloroglucinol-HCl), which reacts cinnamaldehyde in lignin. Levels of p-coumaric acid (PCA) and ferulic acid (FA) were apparently elevated in the abnormal tissue of the mutant. Western blotting analysis with antibodies specific for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) revealed higher levels of PAL in the abnormal parenchyma tissue of Fukei 71 than in the parenchyma tissue of the parent cultivar Fujiminori. These results and the observation that PAL was produced at a greatly elevated level indicated that the phenylpropanoid pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of polysaccharide-linked FA and PCA was abnormally activated in the irregularly shaped and collapsed internode parenchyma cells, in which the biosynthesis of lignin is normally repressed.
11577193	The Purple leaf (Pl) locus of rice: the Pl(w) allele has a complex organization and includes two genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix proteins involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.	2001	Plant Cell Physiol	The Purple leaf (Pl) locus of rice (Oryza sativa L.) affects regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in various plant tissues. The tissue-specific patterns of anthocyanin pigmentation, together with the syntenic relationship, indicate that the rice Pl locus may play a role in the anthocyanin pathway similar to the maize R/B loci. We isolated two cDNAs showing significant identity to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins found in the maize R gene family. OSB1 appeared to be allelic to the previously isolated R homologue, Ra1, but showed a striking difference at the C-terminus because of a 2-bp deletion. Characterization of the corresponding genomic region revealed that the sequence identical to a 5'-portion of OSB2 existed approximately 10-kb downstream of the OSB1 coding region. OSB2 lacks a conserved C-terminal domain. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses using an F(2) population indicate that both genes co-segregate with the purple leaf phenotype. A transient complementation assay showed that the anthocyanin pathway is inducible by OSB1 or OSB2. These results suggest that the Pl(w) allele may be complex and composed of at least two genes encoding bHLH proteins.
18945025	A major quantitative trait locus for rice yellow mottle virus resistance maps to a cluster of blast resistance genes on chromosome 12.	1997	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Two doubled-haploid rice populations, IR64/Azucena and IRAT177/ Apura, were used to identify markers linked to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) resistance using core restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) maps. Resistance was measured by mechanical inoculation of 19-day-old seedlings followed by assessment of virus content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests 15 days after inoculation. IR64/Azucena and IRAT177/Apura populations, 72 and 43 lines, respectively, were evaluated, and resistance was found to be polygenic. Resistance was expressed as a slower virus multiplication, low symptom expression, and limited yield loss when assessed at the field level. Bulked segregant analysis using the IR64/Azucena population identified a single random amplified polymorphic DNA marker that mapped on chromosome 12 and corresponded to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) evidenced by interval mapping. When pooling RFLP data, integrated mapping of this chromosome revealed that the QTL was common to the two populations and corresponded to a small chromosomal segment known to contain a cluster of major blast resistance genes. This region of the genome also reflected the differentiation observed at the RFLP level between the subspecies indica and japonica of Oryza sativa. This is consistent with the observation that most sources of RYMV resistance used in rice breeding are found in upland rice varieties that typically belong to the japonica subspecies.
11874462	Identification of the 19S regulatory particle subunits from the rice 26S proteasome.	2002	Eur J Biochem	The 26S proteasome, a protein complex consisting of a 20S proteasome and a pair of 19S regulatory particles (RP), is involved in ATP-dependent proteolysis in eukaryotes. In yeast, the RP contains six different ATPase subunits and, at least, 11 non-ATPase subunits. In this study, we identified the rice homologs of yeast RP subunit genes from the rice expressed sequence tag (EST) library. The complete nucleotide sequences of the homologs for five ATPase subunits, OsRpt1, OsRpt2, OsRpt4, OsRpt5 and OsRpt6, and five non-ATPase subunits, OsRpn7, OsRpn8, OsRpn10, OsRpn11 and OsRpn12, and the partial sequences of one ATPase subunit, OsRpt3, and six non-ATPase subunits, OsRpn1, OsRpn2, OsRpn3, OsRpn5, OsRpn6 and OsRpn9, were determined. Gene homologs of four ATPase subunits, OsRpt1, OsRpt2, OsRpt4 and OsRpt5, and three non- ATPase subunits, OsRpn1, OsRpn2 and OsRpn9, were found to be encoded by duplicated genes. The rice RP was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with a Protein A column immobilized antibody against rice 20S proteasome, and the subunit composition was determined. The homologs obtained from the rice EST library were identified as genes encoding subunits of RP purified from rice, including the both products of duplicated genes by using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Post-translational modifications and processing in rice RP subunits were also identified. Various types of RP complex with different subunit compositions are present in rice cells, suggesting the multiple functions of rice proteasome.
12582914	Substitution mapping of Pup1: a major QTL increasing phosphorus uptake of rice from a phosphorus-deficient soil.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	A major QTL for P uptake had previously been mapped to a 13-cM marker interval on the long arm of chromosome 12. To map that major QTL with higher precision and certainty, a secondary mapping population was developed by backcrossing a near-isogenic line containing the QTL from the donor parent to the recurrent parent of low P uptake. Two different mapping strategies have been followed in this study. A conventional QTL mapping approach was based on individual F(2) RFLP data and the phenotypic evaluation of family means in the F(3). The second strategy employed a substitution-mapping approach. Phenotypic and marker data were obtained for 160 F(3) individuals of six highly informative families that differed in the size of donor chromosomal segments in the region of the putative QTL. QTL mapping showed that close to 80% of the variation between families was due to a single QTL, hereafter referred to as Pup1 (Phosphorus uptake 1). Pup1 was placed in a 3-cM interval flanked by markers S14025 and S13126, which is within 1 cM of the position identified in the original QTL mapping experiment. Other chromosomal regions and epistatic effects were not significant. Substitution mapping revealed that Pup1 co-segregated with marker S13126 and that the flanking markers, S14025 and S13752, were outside the interval containing Pup1. The two mapping strategies therefore yielded almost identical results and, in combining the advantages of both, Pup1 could be mapped with high certainty. The QTL mapping appoach showed that the phenotypic variation between families was due to only one QTL without any additional epistacic interactions, whereas the advantage of substitution mapping was to place clearly defined borders around the QTL.
16077027	Identification and characterization of endogenous small interfering RNAs from rice.	2005	Nucleic Acids Res	RNA silencing-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have diverse natural roles, ranging from regulation of gene expression and heterochromatin formation to genome defense against transposons and viruses. Unlike miRNAs, endogenous siRNAs are generally not conserved between species; consequently, their identification requires experimental approaches. Thus far, endogenous siRNAs have not been reported from rice, which is a model species for monocotyledonous plants. We identified a large set of putative endogenous siRNAs from root, shoot and inflorescence small RNA cDNA libraries of rice. Most of these siRNAs are from intergenic regions, although a substantial proportion (22%) originates from the introns and exons of protein-coding genes. Northern and RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of some of the siRNAs is tissue specific or developmental stage specific. A total of 25 transposons and 21 protein-coding genes were predicted to be cis-targets of some of the siRNAs. Based on sequence homology, we also predicted 111 putative trans-targets for 44 of the siRNAs. Interestingly, approximately 46% of the predicted trans-targets are transposable elements, which suggests that endogenous siRNAs may play an important role in the suppression of transposon proliferation. Using RNA ligase-mediated-5' rapid amplification of cDNA end assays, we validated three of the predicted targets and provided evidence for both cis- and trans-silencing of target genes by siRNAs-guided mRNA cleavage.
14678782	Mass spectrometric analysis of expression of ATPase subunits encoded by duplicated genes in the 19S regulatory particle of rice 26S proteasome.	2004	Arch Biochem Biophys	The 26S proteasome consisting of a 20S proteasome and a pair of 19S regulatory particles (RP) plays important roles in degradation of the ubiquitinated protein in eukaryotic cells. The RP consists of six different ATPase subunits and, at least, 11 non-ATPase subunits. In rice, we previously identified duplicated genes encoding four ATPase subunits, OsRpt1, OsRpt2, OsRpt4, and OsRpt5. In this study, the genomic sequences of all rice ATPase subunits were identified from the rice genome database and the genomic structure of ATPase subunit genes was determined. The rice RP was purified, and the ATPase subunit isoforms encoded by three pairs of duplicated genes, OsRpt2a/OsRpt2b, OsRpt4a/OsRpt4b, and OsRpt5a/OsRpt5b, were identified in RP by using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The relative amounts and the expression patterns of these ATPase subunit isoforms in the bran were found to be different from those of the callus, suggesting the presence of multiform 19S regulatory particles engaged in the tissue-specific protein metabolism.
24203021	Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant deficient in the heme domain of nitrate reductase.	1992	Theor Appl Genet	Biochemical and genetical characterization of a rice nitrate reductase (NR)-deficient mutant, M819, which had been isolated as a chlorate-resistant mutant, was carried out. In M819, leaf NADH-NR activity was found to be about 10% of that of the wild-type cv 'Norin 8', while NADPH-NR activity was higher than that in the wild-type; FMNH2-NR and MV-NR activities were also 10% of those of the wild type; BPB-NR activity was higher than that of the wild type; and xanthine dehydrogenase activity was revealed to be present in both. These results suggest that the mutant line M819 lacks the functional heme domain of the NADH-NR polypeptide due to a point mutation or a small deletion within the coding region of the structural gene. Chlorate resistance in M819 was transmitted by a single recessive nuclear gene.
24241451	Isozymes and classification of Asian rice varieties.	1987	Theor Appl Genet	Enzyme variation detected by starch gel electrophoresis was used to investigate the genetic structure of Oryza sativa L. species. Fifteen polymorphic loci coding for 8 enzymes were surveyed among 1688 traditional rices from Asia. Multivariate analysis of the data resulted in identification of six varietal groups, with two major ones, groups I and VI, two minor ones, groups II and V, and two satellite ones, groups III and IV. Group I is found throughout tropical Asia; it encompasses most Aman rices in Bangladesh, the Tjereh rices in Indonesia and the Hsien rices in China. Group VI is found mostly in temperate regions and in high elevation areas in the tropics; it encompasses most upland rices from Southeast Asia, the Bulu rices from Indonesia and the Keng rices from China. Groups II, III, IV and V share common differences from groups I and VI which suggest an alternative evolutionary history. Groups II and V are found in the Indian subcontinent from Iran to Burma. Well-known components of these are Aus rices from Bangladesh for group II and Basmati rices from Pakistan and India for group V. Groups III and IV are restricted to some deepwater rices in Bangladesh and Northeast India. Based on analogy with other classifications, Group I might be considered as the "Indica" type and Group VI as the "Japonica" type. Such terms, however, have a depreciated meaning due to discrepancies among various classifications.
12481095	A rice mutant defective in Si uptake.	2002	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates silicon (Si) in the tops to levels up to 10.0% of shoot dry weight, but the mechanism responsible for high Si uptake by rice roots is not understood. We isolated a rice mutant (GR1) that is defective in active Si uptake by screening M(2) seeds (64,000) of rice cv Oochikara that were treated with 10(-3) M sodium azide for 6 h at 25 degrees C. There were no phenotypic differences between wild type (WT) and GR1 except that the leaf blade of GR1 remained droopy when Si was supplied. Uptake experiments showed that Si uptake by GR1 was significantly lower than that by WT at both low and high Si concentrations. However, there was no difference in the uptake of other nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Si concentration in the xylem sap of WT was 33-fold that of the external solution, but that of GR1 was 3-fold higher than the external solution at 0.15 mM Si. Si uptake by WT was inhibited by metabolic inhibitors including NaCN and 2,4-dinitrophenol and by low temperature, whereas Si uptake by GR1 was not inhibited by these agents. These results suggest that an active transport system for Si uptake is disrupted in GR1. Analysis of F(2) populations between GR1 and WT showed that roots with high Si uptake and roots with low Si uptake segregated at a 3:1 ratio, suggesting that GR1 is a recessive mutant of Si uptake.
10517831	The starch-debranching enzymes isoamylase and pullulanase are both involved in amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm	1999	Plant Physiol	The activities of the two types of starch debranching enzymes, isoamylase and pullulanase, were greatly reduced in endosperms of allelic sugary-1 mutants of rice (Oryza sativa), with the decrease more pronounced for isoamylase than for pullulanase. However, the decrease in isoamylase activity was not related to the magnitude of the sugary phenotype (the proportion of the phytoglycogen region of the endosperm), as observed with pullulanase. In the moderately mutated line EM-5, the pullulanase activity was markedly lower in the phytoglycogen region than in the starch region, and isoamylase activity was extremely low or completely lost in the whole endosperm tissue. These results suggest that both debranching enzymes are involved in amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm. We presume that isoamylase plays a predominant role in amylopectin synthesis, but pullulanase is also essential or can compensate for the role of isoamylase in the construction of the amylopectin multiple-cluster structure. It is highly possible that isoamylase was modified in some sugary-1 mutants such as EM-273 and EM-5, since it was present in significant and trace amounts, respectively, in these mutants but was apparently inactive. The results show that the Sugary-1 gene encodes the isoamylase gene of the rice genome.
10634784	Engineering the provitamin A (beta-carotene) biosynthetic pathway into (carotenoid-free) rice endosperm.	2000	Science	Rice (Oryza sativa), a major staple food, is usually milled to remove the oil-rich aleurone layer that turns rancid upon storage, especially in tropical areas. The remaining edible part of rice grains, the endosperm, lacks several essential nutrients, such as provitamin A. Thus, predominant rice consumption promotes vitamin A deficiency, a serious public health problem in at least 26 countries, including highly populated areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Recombinant DNA technology was used to improve its nutritional value in this respect. A combination of transgenes enabled biosynthesis of provitamin A in the endosperm.
11206853	Genetic erosion in northern marginal population of the common wild rice Oryza rufipogon Griff. and its conservation, revealed by the change of population genetic structure.	2000	Hereditas	In order to monitor genetic erosion within the northern marginal population of common wild rice Oryza rufipogon Griff. from Dongxiang, Jiangxi Province, China, allozyme diversity encoded by 22 loci was analyzed electrophoretically from all the existing subpopulations in 1980, 1985 and 1994. The sample collected from the nine large subpopulations in 1980 showed the highest levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.27, P = 18.20%, Ho = 0.042 and He = 0.049) and a slight deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 0.143), the sample from five moderate ones in 1985 displayed medium levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.14, P = 13.60%, Ho = 0.008 and He = 0.049) and a great deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 0.837), and the sample from two small ones in 1994 demonstrated the lowest levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.09, P = 9.10%, Ho = 0.000 and He = 0.043) and the largest deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 1.000). The results not only documented the genetic erosion stemmed from the extinction of the subpopulations, but also revealed the drastic change of the population genetic structure due to the reduction of the population. Finally, some conservation strategies for the population are proposed.
10887680	[Molecular tagging of a new recessive gene for late heading in a rice cultivar 8987].	2000	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	8987 is a late flowering (lf) indica cultivar. In this study, genetic analysis for lf was carried out in the crosses between 8987 and four varieties with different heading time. Inheritance of lf in F1 plants and F2 populations clearly revealed that the lf of 8987 is controlled by one recessive gene. Bulked-segregant method and cosegregation analysis in F2 population were used to screen molecular markers, which were linked with lf gene. The results showed that the lf gene was mapped between the two RFLP marker C213 and RG404 on chromosome 7. The tagged gene will be utilized in molecular marker assisted selection in the future rice breeding program for new varieties.
27172610	Pollen Killer Gene S35 Function Requires Interaction with an Activator That Maps Close to S24, Another Pollen Killer Gene in Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Pollen killer genes disable noncarrier pollens, and are responsible for male sterility and segregation distortion in hybrid populations of distantly related plant species. The genetic networks and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pollen killer system remain largely unknown. Two pollen killer genes, S24 and S35, have been found in an intersubspecific cross of Oryza sativa ssp. indica and japonica The effect of S24 is counteracted by an unlinked locus EFS Additionally, S35 has been proposed to interact with S24 to induce pollen sterility. These genetic interactions are suggestive of a single S24-centric genetic pathway (EFS-S24-S35) for the pollen killer system. To examine this hypothetical genetic pathway, the S35 and the S24 regions were further characterized and genetically dissected in this study. Our results indicated that S35 causes pollen sterility independently of both the EFS and S24 genes, but is dependent on a novel gene close to the S24 locus, named incentive for killing pollen (INK). We confirmed the phenotypic effect of the INK gene separately from the S24 gene, and identified the INK locus within an interval of less than 0.6 Mb on rice chromosome 5. This study characterized the genetic effect of the two independent genetic pathways of INK-S35 and EFS-S24 in indica-japonica hybrid progeny. Our results provide clear evidence that hybrid male sterility in rice is caused by several pollen killer networks with multiple factors positively and negatively regulating pollen killer genes.
19282622	A novel epistatic interaction at two loci causing hybrid male sterility in an inter-subspecific cross of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2008	Genes Genet Syst	Postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) often arises in inter-subspecific crosses as well as inter-specific crosses of rice (Oryza sativa L.). To further understand the genetic architecture of the postzygotic RI, we analyzed genes causing hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown in a rice inter-subspecific cross. Here we report hybrid male sterility caused by epistatic interaction between two novel genes, S24 and S35, which were identified on rice chromosomes 5 and 1, respectively. Genetic analysis using near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying IR24 (ssp. indica) segments with Asominori (ssp. japonica) genetic background revealed a complicated aspect of the epistasis. Allelic interaction at the S24 locus in the heterozygous plants caused abortion of male gametes carrying the Asominori allele (S24-as) independent of the S35 genotype. On the other hand, male gametes carrying the Asominori allele at the S35 locus (S35-as) showed abortion only when the IR24 allele at the S24 locus (S24-ir) was concurrently introgressed into the S35 heterozygous plants, indicating that the sterility phenotype due to S35 was dependent on the S24 genotype through negative epistasis between S24-ir and S35-as alleles. Due to the interaction between S24 and S35, self-pollination of the double heterozygous plants produced pollen-sterile progeny carrying the S24-ir/S24-ir S35-as/S35-ir genotype in addition to the S24 heterozygous plants. This result suggests that the S35 gene might function as a modifier of S24. This study presents strong evidence for the importance of epistatic interaction as a part of the genetic architecture of hybrid sterility in rice. In addition, it suggests that diverse systems have been developed as postzygotic RI mechanisms within the rice.
11480174	[Genetic analysis of dominant earliness of rice genic male sterile line 6442S-7].	2001	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	F1 progenies of a genic male sterile and early maturing indica line 6442S-7 crossed with sixteen medium or late maturing varieties, such as Minghui 63, shared the same heading date as 6442S-7 under long day and short day, suggesting that 6442S-7 has completely dominant earliness. Segregation of heading dates of the F2 and B1F1 populations indicated that the earliness of 6442S-7 is mainly controlled by two dominant major genes. Whereas, heading dates of F1 progenies of 6442S-7 crossed with other four late maturing varieties, i.e. IR68, Xianguo, 9311, and BG1639, closed to the mid-parent value under long day. In F2 populations of 6442S-7 crossed with each of the four late maturing varieties, F1 from three-way crosses between 6442S-7 and each F1 of Minghui 63 crossed with each of the four late maturing varieties, and F1 from three-way crosses between 6442S-7 and each F1 of crosses between each two of the four late maturing varieties, segregation of heading dates showed that an incompletely diminant allelic suppressor for the dominant earliness of 6442S-7 existed in the late maturing varieties, IR68, Xianguo, 9311, and BG1639. It is considered that dominant earliness genes harbored in 6442S-7 have splendid future in rice improvement.
17031545	Plant methionine sulfoxide reductase A and B multigenic families.	2006	Photosynth Res	Methionine oxidation to methionine sulfoxide (MetSo), which results in modification of activity and conformation for many proteins, is reversed by an enzyme present in most organisms and termed as methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR). On the basis of substrate stereospecificity, two types of MSR, A and B, that do not share any sequence similarity, have been identified. In the present review, we first compare the multigenic MSR families in the three plant species for which the genome is fully sequenced: Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Populus trichocarpa. The MSR gene content is larger in A. thaliana (five MSRAs and nine MSRBs) compared to P. trichocarpa (five MSRAs and four MSRBs) and O. sativa (four MSRAs and three MSRBs). A complete classification based on gene structure, sequence identity, position of conserved reactive cysteines and predicted subcellular localization is proposed. On the basis of in silico and experimental data originating mainly from Arabidopsis, we report that some MSR genes display organ-specific expression patterns and that those encoding plastidic MSRs are highly expressed in photosynthetic organs. We also show that the expression of numerous MSR genes is enhanced by environmental conditions known to generate oxidative stress. Thioredoxins (TRXs) constitute very likely physiological electron donors to plant MSR proteins for the catalysis of MetSO reduction, but the specificity between the numerous TRXs and methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) present in plants remains to be investigated. The essential role of plant MSRs in protection against oxidative damage has been recently demonstrated on transgenic Arabidopsis plants modified in the content of cytosolic or plastidic MSRA.
27071131	Nucleotide excision repair by dual incisions in plants.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plants use light for photosynthesis and for various signaling purposes. The UV wavelengths in sunlight also introduce DNA damage in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] that must be repaired for the survival of the plant. Genome sequencing has revealed the presence of genes for both CPD and (6-4)PP photolyases, as well as genes for nucleotide excision repair in plants, such as Arabidopsis and rice. Plant photolyases have been purified, characterized, and have been shown to play an important role in plant survival. In contrast, even though nucleotide excision repair gene homologs have been found in plants, the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair has not been investigated. Here we used the in vivo excision repair assay developed in our laboratory to demonstrate that Arabidopsis removes CPDs and (6-4)PPs by a dual-incision mechanism that is essentially identical to the mechanism of dual incisions in humans and other eukaryotes, in which oligonucleotides with a mean length of 26-27 nucleotides are removed by incising ∼20 phosphodiester bonds 5' and 5 phosphodiester bonds 3' to the photoproduct.
27081183	A Positive Feedback Loop Governed by SUB1A1 Interaction with MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE3 Imparts Submergence Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction networks have been extensively explored in plants; however, the connection between MAPK signaling cascades and submergence tolerance is currently unknown. The ethylene response factor-like protein SUB1A orchestrates a plethora of responses during submergence stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, we report that MPK3 is activated by submergence in a SUB1A-dependent manner. MPK3 physically interacts with and phosphorylates SUB1A in a tolerant-allele-specific manner. Furthermore, the tolerant allele SUB1A1 binds to the MPK3 promoter and regulates its expression in a positive regulatory loop during submergence stress signaling. We present molecular and physiological evidence for the key role of the MPK3-SUB1A1 module in acclimation of rice seedlings to the adverse effects of submergence. Overall, the results provide a mechanistic understanding of submergence tolerance in rice.

27081181	Crystal Structure of the GRAS Domain of SCARECROW-LIKE7 in Oryza sativa.	2016	Plant Cell	GRAS proteins belong to a plant-specific protein family with many members and play essential roles in plant growth and development, functioning primarily in transcriptional regulation. Proteins in the family are minimally defined as containing the conserved GRAS domain. Here, we determined the structure of the GRAS domain of Os-SCL7 from rice (Oryza sativa) to 1.82 Å. The structure includes cap and core subdomains and elucidates the features of the conserved GRAS LRI, VHIID, LRII, PFYRE, and SAW motifs. The structure is a dimer, with a clear groove to accommodate double-stranded DNA. Docking a DNA segment into the groove to generate an Os-SCL7/DNA complex provides insight into the DNA binding mechanism of GRAS proteins. Furthermore, the in vitro DNA binding property of Os-SCL7 and model-defined recognition residues are assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and mutagenesis assays. These studies reveal the structure and preliminary DNA interaction mechanisms of GRAS proteins and open the door to in-depth investigation and understanding of the individual pathways in which they play important roles.
27071313	Two highly similar DEAD box proteins, OsRH2 and OsRH34, homologous to eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIII, play roles of the exon junction complex in regulating growth and development in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The exon junction complex (EJC), which contains four core components, eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIII (eIF4AIII), MAGO/NASHI (MAGO), Y14/Tsunagi/RNA-binding protein 8A, and Barentsz/Metastatic lymph node 51, is formed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and plays important roles in gene expression. Genes encoding core EJC components have been found in plants, including rice. Currently, the functional characterizations of MAGO and Y14 homologs have been demonstrated in rice. However, it is still unknown whether eIF4AIII is essential for the functional EJC in rice.

RESULTS: This study investigated two DEAD box RNA helicases, OsRH2 and OsRH34, which are homologous to eIF4AIII, in rice. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that OsRH2 and OsRH34 had 99 % identity and 100 % similarity, and their gene expression patterns were similar in various rice tissues, but the level of OsRH2 mRNA was about 58-fold higher than that of OsRH34 mRNA in seedlings. From bimolecular fluorescence complementation results, OsRH2 and OsRH34 interacted physically with OsMAGO1 and OsY14b, respectively, which indicated that both of OsRH2 and OsRH34 were core components of the EJC in rice. To study the biological roles of OsRH2 and OsRH34 in rice, transgenic rice plants were generated by RNA interference. The phenotypes of three independent OsRH2 and OsRH34 double-knockdown transgenic lines included dwarfism, a short internode distance, reproductive delay, defective embryonic development, and a low seed setting rate. These phenotypes resembled those of mutants with gibberellin-related developmental defects. In addition, the OsRH2 and OsRH34 double-knockdown transgenic lines exhibited the accumulation of unspliced rice UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM 1 mRNA.

CONCLUSIONS: Rice contains two eIF4AIII paralogous genes, OsRH2 and OsRH34. The abundance of OsRH2 mRNA was about 58-fold higher than that of OsRH34 mRNA in seedlings, suggesting that the OsRH2 is major eIF4AIII in rice. Both OsRH2 and OsRH34 are core components of the EJC, and participate in regulating of plant height, pollen, and seed development in rice.
27208230	Down-Regulation of a Nicotinate Phosphoribosyltransferase Gene, OsNaPRT1, Leads to Withered Leaf Tips.	2016	Plant Physiol	Premature leaf senescence affects plant growth and yield in rice. NAD plays critical roles in cellular redox reactions and remains at a sufficient level in the cell to prevent cell death. Although numerous factors affecting leaf senescence have been identified, few involving NAD biosynthetic pathways have been described for plants. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Leaf Tip Senescence 1 (LTS1) in rice (Oryza sativa), a recessive mutation in the gene encoding O. sativa nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (OsNaPRT1) in the NAD salvage pathway. A point mutation in OsNaPRT1 leads to dwarfism and the withered leaf tip phenotype, and the lts1 mutant displays early leaf senescence compared to the wild type. Leaf nicotinate and nicotinamide contents are elevated in lts1, while NAD levels are reduced. Leaf tissue of lts1 exhibited significant DNA fragmentation and H2O2 accumulation, along with up-regulation of genes associated with senescence. The lts1 mutant also showed reduced expression of SIR2-like genes (OsSRT1 and OsSRT2) and increased acetylation of histone H3K9. Down-regulation of OsSRTs induced histone H3K9 acetylation of senescence-related genes. These results suggest that deficiency in the NAD salvage pathway can trigger premature leaf senescence due to transcriptional activation of senescence-related genes.
27208309	Members of BTB Gene Family of Scaffold Proteins Suppress Nitrate Uptake and Nitrogen Use Efficiency.	2016	Plant Physiol	Development of crops with improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is essential for sustainable agriculture. However, achieving this goal has proven difficult since NUE is a complex trait encompassing physiological and developmental processes. We thought to tackle this problem by taking a systems biology approach to identify candidate target genes. First, we used a supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict a NUE gene network in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Second, we identified BT2, a member of the Bric-a-Brac/Tramtrack/Broad gene family, as the most central and connected gene in the NUE network. Third, we experimentally tested BT2 for a role in NUE. We found NUE decreased in plants overexpressing BT2 gene compared to wild-type plants under limiting nitrate conditions. In addition, NUE increased compared to wild-type plants under low nitrate conditions in double mutant plants in bt2 and its closely related homolog bt1, indicating a functional redundancy of BT1 and BT2 for NUE. Expression of the nitrate transporter genes NRT2.1 and NRT2.4 increased in the bt1/bt2 double mutant compared to wild-type plants, with a concomitant 65% increase in nitrate uptake under low nitrate conditions. Similar to Arabidopsis, we found that mutation of the BT1/BT2 ortholog gene in rice (Oryza sativa) OsBT increased NUE by 20% compared to wild-type rice plants under low nitrogen conditions. These results indicate BT gene family members act as conserved negative regulators of nitrate uptake genes and NUE in plants and highlight them as prime targets for future strategies to improve NUE in crops.
27181944	OsSRT1 is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression.	2016	Plant Sci	OsSRT1 is a NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, closely related to the human SIRT6 that plays key roles in genome stability and metabolic homeostasis. In this work, we investigated the role of OsSRT1 in rice seed development. Down-regulation of OsSRT1 induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development. ChIP assay showed that OsSRT1 was required to reduce histone H3K9 acetylation on starch metabolism genes and transposons in developing seeds. In addition, OsSRT1 was detected to directly bind to starch metabolism genes such as OsAmy3B, OsAmy3E, OsBmy4, and OsBmy9. Our results suggested that OsSRT1-mediated histone deacetylation is involved in starch accumulation and transposon repression to regulate normal seed development.
27121038	Cloning and characterization of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (SNAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Pineal Res	The penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis is serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), which exists as a single copy in mammals and plants. Our recent studies of the Arabidopsis snat-knockout mutant and SNAT RNAi rice (Oryza sativa) plants predicted the presence of at least one other SNAT isogene in plants; that is, the snat-knockout mutant of Arabidopsis and the SNAT RNAi rice plants still produced melatonin, even in the absence or the suppression of SNAT expression. Here, we report a molecular cloning of an SNAT isogene (OsSNAT2) from rice. The mature amino acid sequences of SNAT proteins indicated that OsSNAT2 and OsSNAT1 proteins had 39% identity values and 60% similarity. The Km and Vmax values of the purified recombinant OsSNAT2 were 371 μm and 4700 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively; the enzyme's optimal activity temperature was 45°C. Confocal microscopy showed that the OsSNAT2 protein was localized to both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts. The in vitro enzyme activity of OsSNAT2 was severely inhibited by melatonin, but the activities of sheep SNAT (OaSNAT) and rice OsSNAT1 proteins were not. The enzyme activity of OsSNAT2 was threefold higher than that of OsSNAT1, but 232-fold lower than that of OaSNAT. The OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 transcripts were similarly suppressed in rice leaves during the melatonin induction after cadmium treatment. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that OsSNAT1 and OsSNAT2 are distantly related, suggesting that they evolved independently from Cyanobacteria prior to the endosymbiosis event.
27061371	Biochemical and molecular responses underlying differential arsenic tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	The arsenic (As) is a toxic element causing major health concern worldwide. Arsenate stress caused no significant reduction in growth parameters and shoot electrolyte leakage but showed increased root arsenate reductase activity along with relatively lower root As content and shoot translocation rate in As-tolerant BRRI 33 than in As-sensitive BRRI 51. It indicates that As inhibition and tolerance mechanisms are driven by root responses. Interestingly, As stress showed consistent decrease in phosphate content and expression of phosphate transporters (OsPT8, OsPT4, OsPHO1;2) under both high and low phosphate conditions in roots of BRRI 33, suggesting that limiting phosphate transport mainly mediated by OsPHO1;2 directs less As accumulation in BRRI 33. Further, BRRI 33 showed simultaneous increase in OsPCS1 (phytochelatin synthase) expression and phytochelatins (PCs) content in roots under As exposure supporting the hypothesis that root As sequestration acts as 'firewall system' in limiting As translocation in shoots. Furthermore, increased CAT, POD, SOD, GR, along with elevated glutathione, methionine, cysteine and proline suggests that strong antioxidant defense plays integral part to As tolerance in BRRI 33. Again, BRRI 33 self-grafts and plants having BRRI 33 rootstock combined with BRRI 51 scion had no adverse effect on morphological parameters but showed reduced As translocation rate, increased root arsenate reductase activity, shoot PC synthesis and root OsPHO1;2 expression due to As stress. It confirms that signal driving As tolerance mechanisms is generated in the roots. These findings can be implemented for As detoxification and As-free transgenic rice production for health safety.
27107174	The OsmiR396c-OsGRF4-OsGIF1 regulatory module determines grain size and yield in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Grain weight is the most important component of rice yield and is mainly determined by grain size, which is generally controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Although numerous QTLs that regulate grain weight have been identified, the genetic network that controls grain size remains unclear. Herein, we report the cloning and functional analysis of a dominant QTL, grain length and width 2 (GLW2), which positively regulates grain weight by simultaneously increasing grain length and width. The GLW2 locus encodes OsGRF4 (growth-regulating factor 4) and is regulated by the microRNA miR396c in vivo. The mutation in OsGRF4 perturbs the OsmiR396 target regulation of OsGRF4, generating a larger grain size and enhanced grain yield. We also demonstrate that OsGIF1 (GRF-interacting factors 1) directly interacts with OsGRF4, and increasing its expression improves grain size. Our results suggest that the miR396c-OsGRF4-OsGIF1 regulatory module plays an important role in grain size determination and holds implications for rice yield improvement.
27118216	Molecular dissection of Oryza sativa salt-induced RING Finger Protein 1 (OsSIRP1): possible involvement in the sensitivity response to salinity stress.	2016	Physiol Plant	Ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation via Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3 ligase plays an important role in plant responses to abiotic stress conditions. Many plant studies have found that RING proteins regulate the perception of various abiotic stresses and signal transduction. In this study, Oryza sativa salt-induced RING Finger Protein 1 (OsSIRP1) gene was selected randomly from 44 Oryza sativa RING Finger Proteins (OsRFPs) genes highly expressed in rice roots exposed to salinity stress. Transcript levels of OsSIRP1 in rice leaves after various stress treatments, including salt, heat, drought and hormone abscisic acid (ABA), were observed. Poly-ubiquitinated products of OsSIRP1 were investigated via an in vitro ubiquitination assay.35S:OsSIRP1-EYFP was distributed in the cytosol of untreated and salt-treated rice protoplasts. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsSIRP1 in Arabidopsis reduced tolerance for salinity stress during seed germination and root growth. Our findings indicate that OsSIRP1 acts as a negative regulator of salinity stress tolerance mediated by the ubiquitin 26S proteasome system.
27208272	Alternative Splicing of Rice WRKY62 and WRKY76 Transcription Factor Genes in Pathogen Defense.	2016	Plant Physiol	The WRKY family of transcription factors (TFs) functions as transcriptional activators or repressors in various signaling pathways. In this study, we discovered that OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76, two genes of the WRKY IIa subfamily, undergo constitutive and inducible alternative splicing. The full-length OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 proteins formed homocomplexes and heterocomplexes, and the heterocomplex dominates in the nuclei when analyzed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Transgenic overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY76.1 in rice (Oryza sativa) enhanced plant susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and the leaf blight bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, whereas RNA interference and loss-of-function knockout plants exhibited elevated resistance. The dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 also showed greatly increased expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexins. The ratio of full-length versus truncated transcripts changed in dsOW62/76 plants as well as in response to pathogen infection. The short alternative OsWRKY62.2 and OsWRKY76.2 isoforms could interact with each other and with full-length proteins. OsWRKY62.2 showed a reduced repressor activity in planta, and two sequence determinants required for the repressor activity were identified in the amino terminus of OsWRKY62.1. The amino termini of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 splice variants also showed reduced binding to the canonical W box motif. These results not only enhance our understanding of the DNA-binding property, the repressor sequence motifs, and the negative feedback regulation of the IIa subfamily of WRKYs but also provide evidence for alternative splicing of WRKY TFs during the plant defense response.
27097755	Structure, organization and evolution of ADP-ribosylation factors in rice and foxtail millet, and their expression in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) have been reported to function in diverse physiological and molecular activities. Recent evidences also demonstrate the involvement of ARFs in conferring tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in plant species. In the present study, 23 and 25 ARF proteins were identified in C3 model- rice and C4 model- foxtail millet, respectively. These proteins are classified into four classes (I-IV) based on phylogenetic analysis, with ARFs in classes I-III and ARF-like proteins (ARLs) in class IV. Sequence alignment and domain analysis revealed the presence of conserved and additional motifs, which may contribute to neo- and sub-functionalization of these proteins. Promoter analysis showed the presence of several cis-regulatory elements related to stress and hormone response, indicating their role in stress regulatory network. Expression analysis of rice ARFs and ARLs in different tissues, stresses and abscisic acid treatment highlighted temporal and spatial diversification of gene expression. Five rice cultivars screened for allelic variations in OsARF genes showed the presence of allelic polymorphisms in few gene loci. Altogether, the study provides insights on characteristics of ARF/ARL genes in rice and foxtail millet, which could be deployed for further functional analysis to extrapolate their precise roles in abiotic stress responses.
27119209	Rice OVERLY TOLERANT TO SALT 1 (OTS1) SUMO protease is a positive regulator of seed germination and root development.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Salinity is one of the major environmental stresses affecting rice production worldwide. Improving rice salt tolerance is a critical step for sustainable food production. Posttranslational modifications of proteins greatly expand proteome diversity, increase functionality and allow quick responses to environmental stresses, all at low cost to the cell. SUMO mediated modification of substrate proteins is a highly dynamic process governed by the balance of activities of SUMO E3 ligases and deconjugating SUMO proteases. In recent years, SUMO (Small Ubiquitin like Modifier) conjugation of proteins has emerged as an influential regulator of stress signaling in the model plant Arabidopsis. However SUMOylation remain largely under studied in crop plants. We recently identified the SUMO protease gene family in rice and demonstrated a role for OsOTS1 SUMO proteases in salt stress. Interestingly, rice plants silencing OsOTS1 also show significantly reduced germination rate. Knockdown of OsOTS1 gene expression affects root growth by primarily reducing cell size rather than cell division.
27052628	Both overexpression and suppression of an Oryza sativa NB-LRR-like gene OsLSR result in autoactivation of immune response and thiamine accumulation.	2016	Sci Rep	Tight and accurate regulation of immunity and thiamine biosynthesis is critical for proper defence mechanisms and several primary metabolic cycles in plants. Although thiamine is known to enhance plant defence by priming, the mechanism by which thiamine biosynthesis responds to immune signals remains poorly understood. Here we identified a novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) NB-LRR gene via an insertion mutation, this mutant confesses a low seed setting phenotype and the corresponding genetic locus was named OsLSR (Low seed setting related). Comparing with wildtype plant, both overexpression and suppression of OsLSR lead to the autoactivation of the rice immune system and accumulation of thiamine, which result in a great fitness cost and yield penalty. Moreover, when fused with eGFP at their C terminus, two fragments, OsLSR1-178 and OsLSR464-546, localized to chloroplasts where thiamine is produced. Our result suggests that OsLSR differs from traditional NB-LRR genes. Its expression is closely related to the immune status and thiamine level in plant cells and should be maintained within a narrow range for rice growth.
27121976	Cuticular Defects in Oryza sativa ATP-binding Cassette Transporter G31 Mutant Plants Cause Dwarfism, Elevated Defense Responses and Pathogen Resistance.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The cuticle covers the surface of the polysaccharide cell wall of leaf epidermal cells and forms an essential diffusion barrier between plant and environment. Homologs of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter AtABCG32/HvABCG31 clade are necessary for the formation of a functional cuticle in both monocots and dicots. Here we characterize the osabcg31 knockout mutant and hairpin RNA interference (RNAi)-down-regulated OsABCG31 plant lines having reduced plant growth and a permeable cuticle. The reduced content of cutin in leaves and structural alterations in the cuticle and at the cuticle-cell wall interface in plants compromised in OsABCG31 expression explain the cuticle permeability. Effects of modifications of the cuticle on plant-microbe interactions were evaluated. The cuticular alterations in OsABCG31-compromised plants did not cause deficiencies in germination of the spores or the formation of appressoria of Magnaporthe oryzae on the leaf surface, but a strong reduction of infection structures inside the plant. Genes involved in pathogen resistance were constitutively up-regulated in OsABCG31-compromised plants, thus being a possible cause of the resistance to M. oryzae and the dwarf growth phenotype. The findings show that in rice an abnormal cuticle formation may affect the signaling of plant growth and defense.
27095382	SNP-based analysis of genetic diversity reveals important alleles associated with seed size in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the genetic markers of choice in various genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a next-generation-sequencing based method that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high-throughput genotyping using a large number of SNP markers.

RESULTS: In the present study, the distribution of non-redundant SNPs in the parents of 12 rice recombination line populations was evaluated through GBS. A total of 45 Gigabites of nucleotide sequences conservatively provided satisfactory genotyping of rice SNPs. By assembling to the genomes of reference genomes of japonica Nipponbare, we detected 22,682 polymorphic SNPs that may be utilized for QTL/gene mapping with the Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL) populations derived from these parental lines. Meanwhile, we identified polymorphic SNPs with large effects on protein-coding and miRNA genes. To validate the effect of the polymorphic SNPs, we further investigated a SNP (chr4:28,894,757) at the miRNA binding site in the 3'-UTR region of the locus Os4g48460, which is associated with rice seed size. Os4g48460 encodes a putative cytochrome P450, CYP704A3. Direct degradation of the 3'-UTR of the CYP704A3 gene by a miRNA (osa-miRf10422-akr) was validated by in planta mRNA degradation assay. We also showed that rice seeds of longer lengths may be produced by downregulating CYP704A3 via RNAi.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified the genome-wide SNPs by GBS of the parental varieties of RIL populations and identified CYP704A3, a miRNA-regulated gene that is responsible for rice seed length.
27079330	Functional characterization of a type 2 metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-2b) from rice.	2016	Int J Biol Macromol	Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of Cys-rich, low molecular weight, cytoplasmic metal binding proteins. MTs are present in all eukaryotes as well as some prokaryotes. Plant MTs are divided into four types based on Cys distribution pattern in their amino acid sequences. In the present work, the gene encoding OsMTI-2b, a type 2 MT found in rice, was cloned into pET41a vector. The resulting construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3). Following the induction with Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside the OsMTI-2b was expressed as carboxyl-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-tag), a 6His-tag, and an S-tag. The expressed recombinant fusion protein was named GST-OsMTI-2b. As compared with control, transgenic E. coli cells expressing GST-OsMTI-2b accumulated more Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) from culture medium and showed increased tolerance against these metals. Furthermore the E. coli cells expressing OsMTI-2b accumulated significantly higher Pb(2+) than previously made strains which expressing other rice OsMT isoforms. The recombinant GST-OsMTI-2b was purified using affinity chromatography. According to in vitro assays the protein GST-OsMTI-2b was able to form complexes with Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cd(2+) and Zn(2+). However, the binding ability for the different metals differed in the order: Pb(2+)>Cd(2+)>Zn(2+)>Ni(2+).
27174139	Overexpression of rice glutaredoxins (OsGrxs) significantly reduces arsenite accumulation by maintaining glutathione pool and modulating aquaporins in yeast.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Arsenic (As) is an acute poison and class I carcinogen, can cause a serious health risk. Staple crops like rice are the primary source of As contamination in human food. Rice grown on As contaminated areas accumulates higher As in their edible parts. Based on our previous transcriptome data, two rice glutaredoxins (OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1) were identified that showed up-regulated expression during As stress. Here, we report OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 from rice involved in the regulation of intracellular arsenite (AsIII). To elucidate the mechanism of OsGrx mediated As tolerance, both OsGrxs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Δars) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains (Δycf1, Δacr3). The expression of OsGrxs increased As tolerance in E. coli (Δars) mutant strain (up to 4 mM AsV and up to 0.6 mM AsIII). During AsIII exposure, S. cerevisiae (Δacr3) harboring OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 have lower intracellular AsIII accumulation (up to 30.43% and 24.90%, respectively), compared to vector control. Arsenic accumulation in As-sensitive S. cerevisiae mutant (Δycf1) also reduced significantly on exposure to inorganic As. The expression of OsGrxs in yeast maintained intracellular GSH pool and increased extracellular GSH concentration. Purified OsGrxs displays in vitro GSH-disulfide oxidoreductase, glutathione reductase and arsenate reductase activities. Also, both OsGrxs are involved in AsIII extrusion by altering the Fps1 transcripts in yeast and protect the cell by maintaining cellular GSH pool. Thus, our results strongly suggest that OsGrxs play a crucial role in the maintenance of the intracellular GSH pool and redox status of the cell during both AsV and AsIII stress and might be involved in regulating intracellular AsIII levels by modulation of aquaporin expression and functions.
27108205	CRL6, a member of the CHD protein family, is required for crown root development in rice.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	The root system in monocotyledonous plants is largely composed of postembryonic shoot-borne roots named crown roots, which are important for nutrients and water uptake. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of crown root development is not fully explored. In this study, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in crown root formation, designated as crown rootless6 (crl6). Histological analysis showed that CRL6 influences crown root formation by regulating primordial initiation and development. Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests verified that the CRL6 gene encodes a member of the large chromodomain, helicase/ATPase, and DNA-binding domain (CHD) family protein. Realtime RT-PCR analysis showed that CRL6 was most highly expressed in the stem base region where crown roots initiated. In addition, auxin-action inhibited phenotype was observed during crl6 development. The expressions of OsIAA genes were down-regulated in crl6. Our results provide evidence that CRL6 plays an important role in crown root development in rice via auxin-related signaling pathway.
27091552	The role of silicon in enhancing resistance to bacterial blight of hydroponic- and soil-cultured rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Here we report for the first time that bacterial blight of rice can be alleviated by silicon (Si) added. In both inoculated and uninoculated plants, shoot dry weight was significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. A soil-cultured trial showed that disease severity was 24.3% lower in the Si-amended plants than in the non-Si-amended plants. Plants that were switched from -Si to +Si nutrient solution and simultaneously inoculated with Xoo also exhibited the same high resistance to bacterial blight as the plants that were treated continuously with Si, with control efficiencies of 52.8 and 62.9%, respectively. Moreover, total concentrations of soluble phenolics and lignin in rice leaves were significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities in rice leaves were observed to be higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. The expression levels of Os03g0109600, Prla, Rcht2 and Lox2osPil, were also higher in +Si plants than in -Si plants post-inoculation during the experimental time. Addition of Si resulted in increased Pal transcription, and inhibited CatA and Os03g0126000 expression in the earlier and later stages of bacterial inoculation, respectively.
27156135	Biochemical characterization of plant Rad52 protein from rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	DNA damage in living cells is repaired by two main pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Of all the genes promoting HR, Rad52 (Radiation sensitive 52) is an important gene which is found to be highly conserved across different species. It was believed that RAD52 is absent in plant systems until lately. However, recent genetic studies have shown the presence of RAD52 homologues in plants. Rad52 homologues in plant systems have not yet been characterized biochemically. In the current study, we bring out the biochemical properties of rice Rad52-2a protein. OsRad52-2a was over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and the protein was purified. The identity of purified OsRad52-2a protein was confirmed via peptide mass fingerprinting. Gel filtration and native PAGE analysis indicated that the OsRad52-2a protein in its native state probably formed an undecameric structure. Purified OsRad52-2a protein showed binding to single stranded DNA, double stranded DNA. Protein also mediated the renaturation of complementary single strands into duplex DNA in both agarose gel and FRET based assays. Put together, OsRad52-2a forms oligomeric structures and binds to ssDNA/dsDNA for mediating an important function like renaturation during homologous recombination. This study represents the first report on biochemical properties of OsRad52-2a protein from important crop like rice. This information will help in dissecting the recombination and repair machinery in plant systems.
26977084	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	2016	Plant Cell	Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are key endogenous regulators of plant growth. Previous work identified ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (EUI1) as a GA-deactivating enzyme that plays an important role in panicle exsertion from the flag leaf sheath in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the mechanism that regulates EUI1 activity during development is still largely unexplored. In this study, we identified the dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), whose phenotype is caused by the activation of the homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12. Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhanced panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype. HOX12 knockdown plants contain higher levels of the major biologically active GAs (such as GA1 and GA4) than the wild type. The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but reduced in HOX12 knockdown plants. Interestingly, both HOX12 and EUI1 are predominantly expressed in panicles, where GA4 is highly accumulated. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HOX12 physically interacts with the EUI1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, plants overexpressing HOX12 in the eui1 mutant background retained the elongated uppermost internode phenotype. These results indicate that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice.

26941088	LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1 Regulates Light-Dependent Attachment of LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP+ OXIDOREDUCTASE to the Thylakoid Membrane in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	Plant Cell	LIR1 (LIGHT-INDUCED RICE1) encodes a 13-kD, chloroplast-targeted protein containing two nearly identical motifs of unknown function. LIR1 is present in the genomes of vascular plants, mosses, liverworts, and algae, but not in cyanobacteria. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, pull-down assays, and yeast two-hybrid analyses, we showed that LIR1 interacts with LEAF-TYPE FERREDOXIN-NADP(+) OXIDOREDUCTASE (LFNR), an essential chloroplast enzyme functioning in the last step of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. LIR1 and LFNR formed high molecular weight thylakoid protein complexes with the TIC62 and TROL proteins, previously shown to anchor LFNR to the membrane. We further showed that LIR1 increases the affinity of LFNRs for TIC62 and that the rapid light-triggered degradation of the LIR1 coincides with the release of the LFNR from the thylakoid membrane. Loss of LIR1 resulted in a marked decrease in the accumulation of LFNR-containing thylakoid protein complexes without a concomitant decrease in total LFNR content. In rice (Oryza sativa), photosynthetic capacity of lir1 plants was slightly impaired, whereas no such effect was observed in Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutants. The consequences of LIR1 deficiency in different species are discussed.
26950093	OsSPL13 controls grain size in cultivated rice.	2016	Nat Genet	Although genetic diversity has a cardinal role in domestication, abundant natural allelic variations across the rice genome that cause agronomically important differences between diverse varieties have not been fully explored. Here we implement an approach integrating genome-wide association testing with functional analysis on grain size in a diverse rice population. We report that a major quantitative trait locus, GLW7, encoding the plant-specific transcription factor OsSPL13, positively regulates cell size in the grain hull, resulting in enhanced rice grain length and yield. We determine that a tandem-repeat sequence in the 5' UTR of OsSPL13 alters its expression by affecting transcription and translation and that high expression of OsSPL13 is associated with large grains in tropical japonica rice. Further analysis indicates that the large-grain allele of GLW7 in tropical japonica rice was introgressed from indica varieties under artificial selection. Our study demonstrates that new genes can be effectively identified on the basis of genome-wide association data.

26940322	Exogenous proteinogenic amino acids induce systemic resistance in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Plant immune responses can be induced by endogenous and exogenous signaling molecules. Recently, amino acids and their metabolites have been reported to affect the plant immune system. However, how amino acids act in plant defense responses has yet to be clarified. Here, we report that treatment of rice roots with amino acids such as glutamate (Glu) induced systemic disease resistance against rice blast in leaves.

RESULTS: Treatment of roots with Glu activated the transcription of a large variety of defense-related genes both in roots and leaves. In leaves, salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes, rather than jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene (ET)-responsive genes, were induced by this treatment. The Glu-induced blast resistance was partially impaired in rice plants deficient in SA signaling such as NahG plants expressing an SA hydroxylase, WRKY45-knockdown, and OsNPR1-knockdown plants. The JA-deficient mutant cpm2 exhibited full Glu-induced blast resistance.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the amino acid-induced blast resistance partly depends on the SA pathway but an unknown SA-independent signaling pathway is also involved.
26936408	OsGRF4 controls grain shape, panicle length and seed shattering in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Traits such as grain shape, panicle length and seed shattering, play important roles in grain yield and harvest. In this study, the cloning and functional analysis of PANICLE TRAITS 2 (PT2), a novel gene from the Indica rice Chuandali (CDL), is reported. PT2 is synonymous with Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), which encodes a growth-regulating factor that positively regulates grain shape and panicle length and negatively regulates seed shattering. Higher expression of OsGRF4 is correlated with larger grain, longer panicle and lower seed shattering. A unique OsGRF4 mutation, which occurs at the OsmiRNA396 target site of OsGRF4, seems to be associated with high levels of OsGRF4 expression, and results in phenotypic difference. Further research showed that OsGRF4 regulated two cytokinin dehydrogenase precursor genes (CKX5 and CKX1) resulting in increased cytokinin levels, which might affect the panicle traits. High storage capacity and moderate seed shattering of OsGRF4 may be useful in high-yield breeding and mechanized harvesting of rice. Our findings provide additional insight into the molecular basis of panicle growth.
26960731	OsDMC1 Is Not Required for Homologous Pairing in Rice Meiosis.	2016	Plant Physiol	Meiotic homologous recombination is pivotal to sexual reproduction. DMC1, a conserved recombinase, is involved in directing single-end invasion between interhomologs during meiotic recombination. In this study, we identified OsDMC1A and OsDMC1B, two closely related proteins in rice (Oryza sativa) with high sequence similarity to DMC1 proteins from other species. Analysis of Osdmc1a and Osdmc1b Tos17 insertion mutants indicated that these genes are functionally redundant. Immunolocalization analysis revealed OsDMC1 foci occurred at leptotene, which disappeared from late pachytene chromosomes in wild-type meiocytes. According to cytological analyses, homologous pairing is accomplished in the Osdmc1a Osdmc1b double mutant, but synapsis is seriously disrupted. The reduced number of bivalents and abnormal OsHEI10 foci in Osdmc1a Osdmc1b establishes an essential role for OsDMC1 in crossover formation. In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of γH2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1, and OsRAD51C. Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1, and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4, and Oshei10 Taken together, these results suggest that during meiosis, OsDMC1 is dispensable for homologous pairing in rice, which is quite different from the DMC1 homologs identified so far in other organisms.
26987457	Rice PROTEIN l-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE isoforms differentially accumulate during seed maturation to restrict deleterious isoAsp and reactive oxygen species accumulation and are implicated in seed vigor and longevity.	2016	New Phytol	PROTEIN l-ISOASPARTYL O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT) is a protein-repairing enzyme involved in seed vigor and longevity. However, the regulation of PIMT isoforms during seed development and the mechanism of PIMT-mediated improvement of seed vigor and longevity are largely unknown. In this study in rice (Oryza sativa), we demonstrate the dynamics and correlation of isoaspartyl (isoAsp)-repairing demands and PIMT activity, and their implications, during seed development, germination and aging, through biochemical, molecular and genetic studies. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that rice possesses various biochemically active and inactive PIMT isoforms. Transcript and western blot analyses clearly showed the seed development stage and tissue-specific accumulation of active isoforms. Immunolocalization studies revealed distinct isoform expression in embryo and aleurone layers. Further analyses of transgenic lines for each OsPIMT isoform revealed a clear role in the restriction of deleterious isoAsp and age-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to improve seed vigor and longevity. Collectively, our data suggest that a PIMT-mediated, protein repair mechanism is initiated during seed development in rice, with each isoform playing a distinct, yet coordinated, role. Our results also raise the intriguing possibility that PIMT repairs antioxidative enzymes and proteins which restrict ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation, etc. in seed, particularly during aging, thus contributing to seed vigor and longevity.
26986930	Salt-responsive mechanisms in chromosome segment substitution lines of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. KDML105).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Two chromosome segment substitution lines of Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) rice that carry quantitative trait loci for drought tolerance located on chromosome 8 (DT-QTL8) designated CSSL8-94 and CSSL8-116 were investigated for co-expression network and physiological responses to salinity compared to their parents (KDML105; drought and salt sensitive recurrent parent, and DH103; drought tolerant QTL donor). These CSSL lines show different salt-response traits under salt stress (CSSL8-94 shows higher tolerance than CSSL8-116) and possess different segments of DT-QTL8. To identify specific biological process(es) associated with salt-stress response, co-expression network analysis was constructed from each DT-QTL segment. To evaluate differential physiological mechanisms responding to salt stress, all rice lines/cultivar were grown for 21 d in soils submerged in nutrient solutions, then subjected to 150 mM NaCl for 7 d. Physiological parameters related to co-expression network analysis (photosynthetic parameters) and salt responsive parameters (Na(+)/K(+) ratio, proline content, malondialdehyde and ascorbate peroxidase activity; EC1.11.1.1) were investigated along with the expression analysis of related genes. Physiological responses under salt stress particularly photosynthesis-related parameters of CSSL8-94 were similar to DH103, whereas those of CSSL8-116 were similar to KDML105. Moreover, expression levels of photosynthesis-related genes selected from the co-expression networks (Os08g41460, Os08g44680, Os06g01850, Os03g07300 and Os02g42570) were slightly decreased or stable in CSSL8-94 and DH103 but were dramatically down-regulated in CSSL8-116 and KDML105. These differential responses may contribute to the photosynthesis systems of CSSL8-94 being less damaged under salt stress in comparison to those of CSSL8-116. It can be concluded that the presence of the specific DT-QTL8 segment in CSSL8-94 not only confers drought tolerant traits but also enhances its salt tolerant ability.
27000976	An Integrated Genomic Strategy Delineates Candidate Mediator Genes Regulating Grain Size and Weight in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	The present study deployed a Mediator (MED) genes-mediated integrated genomic strategy for understanding the complex genetic architecture of grain size/weight quantitative trait in rice. The targeted multiplex amplicon resequencing of 55 MED genes annotated from whole rice genome in 384 accessions discovered 3971 SNPs, which were structurally and functionally annotated in diverse coding and non-coding sequence-components of genes. Association analysis, using the genotyping information of 3971 SNPs in a structured population of 384 accessions (with 50-100 kb linkage disequilibrium decay), detected 10 MED gene-derived SNPs significantly associated (46% combined phenotypic variation explained) with grain length, width and weight in rice. Of these, one strong grain weight-associated non-synonymous SNP (G/A)-carrying OsMED4_2 gene was validated successfully in low- and high-grain weight parental accessions and homozygous individuals of a rice mapping population. The seed-specific expression, including differential up/down-regulation of three grain size/weight-associated MED genes (including OsMED4_2) in six low and high-grain weight rice accessions was evident. Altogether, combinatorial genomic approach involving haplotype-based association analysis delineated diverse functionally relevant natural SNP-allelic variants in 10 MED genes, including three potential novel SNP haplotypes in an OsMED4_2 gene governing grain size/weight differentiation in rice. These molecular tags have potential to accelerate genomics-assisted crop improvement in rice.
26983995	A Cation-Chloride Cotransporter Gene Is Required for Cell Elongation and Osmoregulation in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is characterized by having fibrous root systems; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the root development are not fully understood. Here, we isolated a rice mutant with short roots and found that the mutant had a decreased cell size of the roots and shoots compared with wild-type rice. Map-based cloning combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed that a single nucleotide mutation occurred in a gene, which encodes a putative cation-chloride cotransporter (OsCCC1). Introduction of OsCCC1 cDNA into the mutant rescued the mutant growth, indicating that growth defects of both the roots and shoots are caused by loss of function of OsCCC1. Physiological analysis showed that the mutant had a lower concentration of Cl(-) and K(+) and lower osmolality in the root cell sap than the wild type at all KCl supply conditions tested; however, the mutant only showed a lower Na(+) concentration at high external Na(+) Expression of OsCCC1 in yeast increased accumulation of K(+), Na(+), and Cl(-) The expression of OsCCC1 was found in both the roots and shoots, although higher expression was found in the root tips. Furthermore, the expression in the roots did not respond to different Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) supply. OsCCC1 was expressed in all cells of the roots, leaf, and basal node. Immunoblot analysis revealed that OsCCC1 was mainly localized to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that OsCCC1 is involved in the cell elongation by regulating ion (Cl(-), K(+), and Na(+)) homeostasis to maintain cellular osmotic potential.
27095404	OsCCD1, a novel small calcium-binding protein with one EF-hand motif, positively regulates osmotic and salt tolerance in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Calcium-binding proteins play key roles in the signal transduction in the growth and stress response in eukaryotes. However, a subfamily of proteins with one EF-hand motif has not been fully studied in higher plants. Here, a novel small calcium-binding protein with a C-terminal centrin-like domain (CCD1) in rice, OsCCD1, was characterized to show high similarity with a TaCCD1 in wheat. As a result, OsCCD1 can bind Ca(2+) in the in vitro EMSA and the fluorescence staining calcium-binding assays. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged OsCCD1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCCD1 was localized in the nucleus and cytosol of rice cells. OsCCD1 transcript levels were transiently induced by osmotic stress and salt stress through the calcium-mediated ABA signal. The rice seedlings of T-DNA mutant lines showed significantly less tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses than wild type plants (p<0.01). Conversely, its overexpressors can significantly enhance the tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses than wild type plants (p<0.05). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that, OsDREB2B, OsAPX1 and OsP5CS genes are involved in the rice tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses. In sum, OsCCD1 gene probably affects the DREB2B and its downstream genes to positively regulate osmotic and salt tolerance in rice seedlings.
27007717	Effective screen of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants in rice by single-strand conformation polymorphism.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A method based on DNA single-strand conformation polymorphism is demonstrated for effective genotyping of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants in rice. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) has been widely adopted for genome editing in many organisms. A large proportion of mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 are very small insertions and deletions (indels), presumably because Cas9 generates blunt-ended double-strand breaks which are subsequently repaired without extensive end-processing. CRISPR/Cas9 is highly effective for targeted mutagenesis in the important crop, rice. For example, homozygous mutant seedlings are commonly recovered from CRISPR/Cas9-treated calli. However, many current mutation detection methods are not very suitable for screening homozygous mutants that typically carry small indels. In this study, we tested a mutation detection method based on single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP). We found it can effectively detect small indels in pilot experiments. By applying the SSCP method for CRISRP-Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in rice, we successfully identified multiple mutants of OsROC5 and OsDEP1. In conclusion, the SSCP analysis will be a useful genotyping method for rapid identification of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants, including the most desirable homozygous mutants. The method also has high potential for similar applications in other plant species.
26945857	On the substrate specificity of the rice strigolactone biosynthesis enzyme DWARF27.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The β-carotene isomerase OsDWARF27 is stereo- and double bond-specific. It converts bicyclic carotenoids with at least one unsubstituted β-ionone ring. OsDWARF27 may contribute to the formation of α-carotene-based strigolactone-like compounds. Strigolactones (SLs) are synthesized from all-trans-β-carotene via a pathway involving the β-carotene isomerase DWARF27, the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 7 and 8 (CCD7, CCD8), and cytochrome P450 enzymes from the 711 clade (MAX1 in Arabidopsis). The rice enzyme DWARF27 was shown to catalyze the reversible isomerization of all-trans- into 9-cis-β-carotene in vitro. β-carotene occurs in different cis-isomeric forms, and plants accumulate other carotenoids, which may be substrates of DWARF27. Here, we investigated the stereo and substrate specificity of the rice enzyme DWARF27 in carotenoid-accumulating E. coli strains and in in vitro assays performed with heterologously expressed and purified enzyme. Our results suggest that OsDWARF27 is strictly double bond-specific, solely targeting the C9-C10 double bond. OsDWARF27 did not introduce a 9-cis-double bond in 13-cis- or 15-cis-β-carotene. Substrates isomerized by OsDWARF27 are bicyclic carotenoids, including β-, α-carotene and β,β-cryptoxanthin, that contain at least one unsubstituted β-ionone ring. Accordingly, OsDWARF27 did not produce the abscisic acid precursors 9-cis-violaxanthin or -neoxanthin from the corresponding all-trans-isomers, excluding a direct role in the formation of this carotenoid derived hormone. The conversion of all-trans-α-carotene yielded two different isomers, including 9'-cis-α-carotene that might be the precursor of strigolactones with an ε-ionone ring, such as the recently identified heliolactone.
26956369	Heterologous Expression and Functional Analysis of Rice GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE Family Indicates its Role in Glutamate Triggered Calcium Flux in Rice Roots.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the functions of the GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family in Arabidopsis. Still, the functions of OsGLRs in rice, especially the ion channel activities, are largely unknown.

RESULTS: Using the aequorin-based luminescence imaging system, we screened the specificity of amino acids involved in the induction of Ca(2+) flux in rice roots. Of all the amino acids tested, glutamate (Glu) was the only one to trigger Ca(2+) flux significantly in rice roots. Detailed analysis showed a dose response of Ca(2+) increase to different concentrations of Glu. In addition, the Ca(2+) spike response to Glu was rapid, within 20 s after the application. A desensitization assay and pharmacological tests showed that the Glu-triggered Ca(2+) flux is mediated by OsGLRs. Whole genome analysis identified 13 OsGLR genes in rice, and these genes have various expression patterns in different tissues. Subcellular localization studies showed that all the OsGLRs examined are likely localized to the plasma membrane. Bacteria growth assays showed that at least OsGLR2.1 and OsGLR3.2 have the potential to mediate ion uptake in bacteria. Further analysis using Fura-2-based Ca(2+) imaging revealed a Glu-triggered Ca(2+) increase in OsGLR2.1-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells.

CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a molecular basis for investigating mechanisms of Glu-triggered Ca(2+) flux in rice.
26994476	A single cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A1 leads to premature leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Leaf senescence is a programmed developmental process orchestrated by many factors, but its molecular regulation is not yet fully understood. In this study, a novel Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence mutant (ospls1) was examined. Despite normal development in early seedlings, the ospls1 mutant leaves displayed lesion-mimics and early senescence, and a high transpiration rate after tillering. The mutant also showed seed dormancy attributable to physical (defect of micropyle structure) and physiological (abscisic acid sensitivity) factors. Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that a cytosine deletion in the OsPLS1 gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A1 (VHA-A1) underlies the phenotypic abnormalities in the ospls1 mutant. The OsPSL1/VHA-A1 transcript levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in both the ospls1 mutant and its wild type. The significant decrease in both OsPSL1/VHA-A1 gene expression and VHA enzyme activity in the ospls1 mutant strongly suggests a negative regulatory role for the normal OsPLS1/VHA-A1 gene in the onset of rice leaf senescence. The ospls1 mutant featured higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activation of signal transduction by up-regulation of WRKY genes in leaves. Consistent with this, the ospls1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous SA and/or H2O2 Collectively, these results indicated that the OsPSL1/VAH-A1 mutation played a causal role in premature leaf senescence through a combination of ROS and SA signals. To conclude, OsPLS1 is implicated in leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
26831097	ABA receptor PYL9 promotes drought resistance and leaf senescence.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Drought stress is an important environmental factor limiting plant productivity. In this study, we screened drought-resistant transgenic plants from 65 promoter-pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYL) abscisic acid (ABA) receptor gene combinations and discovered that pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines showed dramatically increased drought resistance and drought-induced leaf senescence in both Arabidopsis and rice. Previous studies suggested that ABA promotes senescence by causing ethylene production. However, we found that ABA promotes leaf senescence in an ethylene-independent manner by activating sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s), which subsequently phosphorylate ABA-responsive element-binding factors (ABFs) and Related to ABA-Insensitive 3/VP1 (RAV1) transcription factors. The phosphorylated ABFs and RAV1 up-regulate the expression of senescence-associated genes, partly by up-regulating the expression of Oresara 1. The pyl9 and ABA-insensitive 1-1 single mutants, pyl8-1pyl9 double mutant, and snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant showed reduced ABA-induced leaf senescence relative to the WT, whereas pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants showed enhanced ABA-induced leaf senescence. We found that leaf senescence may benefit drought resistance by helping to generate an osmotic potential gradient, which is increased in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants and causes water to preferentially flow to developing tissues. Our results uncover the molecular mechanism of ABA-induced leaf senescence and suggest an important role of PYL9 and leaf senescence in promoting resistance to extreme drought stress.
26923852	Biosynthesis of natural and novel C-glycosylflavones utilising recombinant Oryza sativa C-glycosyltransferase (OsCGT) and Desmodium incanum root proteins.	2016	Phytochemistry	The rice C-glycosyltransferase (OsCGT) is one of only a small number of characterised plant C-glycosyltransferases (CGT) known. The enzyme C-glucosylates a 2-hydroxyflavanone substrate with UDP-glucose as the sugar donor to produce C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones. We tested substrate specificity of the enzyme, using synthetic 2-hydroxyflavanones, and showed it has the potential to generate known natural CGFs that have been isolated from rice and also other plants. In addition, we synthesised novel, unnatural 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates to test the B-ring chemical space of substrate accepted by the OsCGT and demonstrated the OsCGT capacity as a synthetic reagent to generate significant quantities of known and novel CGFs. Many B-ring analogues are tolerated within a confined steric limit. Finally the OsCGT was used to generate novel mono-C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones as putative biosynthetic intermediates to examine the potential of Desmodium incanum biosynthetic CGTs to produce novel di-C-glycosylflavones, compounds implicated in the allelopathic biological activity of Desmodium against parasitic weeds from the Striga genus.
26912459	ATP binding by the P-loop NTPase OsYchF1 (an unconventional G protein) contributes to biotic but not abiotic stress responses.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	G proteins are involved in almost all aspects of the cellular regulatory pathways through their ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. The YchF subfamily, interestingly, possesses the unique ability to bind both ATP and GTP, and is possibly an ancestral form of G proteins based on phylogenetic studies and is present in all kingdoms of life. However, the biological significance of such a relaxed ligand specificity has long eluded researchers. Here, we have elucidated the different conformational changes caused by the binding of a YchF homolog in rice (OsYchF1) to ATP versus GTP by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, by comparing the 3D relationships of the ligand position and the various amino acid residues at the binding sites in the crystal structures of the apo-bound and ligand-bound versions, a mechanism for the protein's ability to bind both ligands is revealed. Mutation of the noncanonical G4 motif of the OsYchF1 to the canonical sequence for GTP specificity precludes the binding/hydrolysis of ATP and prevents OsYchF1 from functioning as a negative regulator of plant-defense responses, while retaining its ability to bind/hydrolyze GTP and its function as a negative regulator of abiotic stress responses, demonstrating the specific role of ATP-binding/hydrolysis in disease resistance. This discovery will have a significant impact on our understanding of the structure-function relationships of the YchF subfamily of G proteins in all kingdoms of life.
26872973	Ajuga Δ24-Sterol Reductase Catalyzes the Direct Reductive Conversion of 24-Methylenecholesterol to Campesterol.	2016	J Biol Chem	Dimunito/Dwarf1 (DWF1) is an oxidoreductase enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of C28- and C29-Δ(24(28))-olefinic sterols to 24-methyl- and 24-ethylcholesterols. Generally, the reaction proceeds in two steps via the Δ(24(25))intermediate. In this study, we characterized theArDWF1gene from an expression sequence tag library ofAjuga reptansvar.atropurpureahairy roots. The gene was functionally expressed in the yeast T21 strain. Thein vivoandin vitrostudy of the transformed yeast indicated that ArDWF1 catalyzes the conversion of 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol. A labeling study followed by GC-MS analysis suggested that the reaction proceeded with retention of the C-25 hydrogen. The 25-H retention was established by the incubation of the enzyme with (23,23,25-(2)H3,28-(13)C)-24-methylenecholesterol, followed by(13)C NMR analysis of the resulting campesterol. Thus, it has been concluded that ArDWF1 directly reduces 24-methylenecholesterol to produce campesterol without passing through a Δ(24(25))intermediate. This is the first characterization of such a unique DWF1 enzyme. For comparison purposes,Oryza sativa DWF1(OsDWF1) was similarly expressed in yeast. Anin vivoassay of OsDWF1 supported the generally accepted two-step mechanism because the C-25 hydrogen of 24-methylenecholesterol was eliminated during its conversion to 24-methylcholesterol. As expected, the 24-methylcholesterol produced by OsDWF1 was a mixture of campesterol and dihydrobrassicasterol. Furthermore, the 24-methylcholesterol contained in theAjugahairy roots was determined to be solely campesterol through its analysis using chiral GC-MS. Therefore, ArDWF1 has another unique property in that only campesterol is formed by the direct reduction catalyzed by the enzyme.
26864016	Homodimerization of Ehd1 Is Required to Induce Flowering in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	In plants, flowering time is elaborately controlled by various environment factors. Ultimately, florigens such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) or FT-like molecules induce flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) is a major inducer of florigen gene expression. Although Ehd1 is highly homologous to the type-B response regulator (RR) family in the cytokinin signaling pathway, its precise molecular mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we showed that the C-terminal portion of the protein containing the GARP DNA-binding (G) domain can promote flowering when overexpressed. We also observed that the N-terminal portion of Ehd1, carrying the receiver (R) domain, delays flowering by inhibiting endogenous Ehd1 activity. Ehd1 protein forms a homomer via a 16-amino acid region in the inter domain between R and G. From the site-directed mutagenesis analyses, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the Asp-63 residue within the R domain induces the homomerization of Ehd1, which is crucial for Ehd1 activity. A type-A RR, OsRR1, physically interacts with Ehd1 to form a heterodimer. In addition, OsRR1-overexpressing plants show a late-flowering phenotype. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsRR1 inhibits Ehd1 activity by binding to form an inactive complex.
26834011	Tissue-specific expression, developmentally and spatially regulated alternative splicing, and protein subcellular localization of OsLpa rice.	2016	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	The OsLpa1 gene (LOC_Os57400) was identified to be involved in phytic acid (PA) metabolism because its knockout and missense mutants reduce PA content in rice grain. However, little is known about the molecular characteristics of OsLpa rice and of its homologues in other plants. In the present study, the spatial pattern of OsLpa1 expression was revealed using OsLpa1 promoter::GUS transgenic plants (GUS: β-glucuronidase); GUS histochemical assay showed that OsLpa1 was strongly expressed in stem, leaf, and root tissues, but in floral organ it is expressed mainly and strongly in filaments. In seeds, GUS staining was concentrated in the aleurone layers; a few blue spots were observed in the outer layers of embryo, but no staining was observed in the endosperm. Three OsLpa1 transcripts (OsLpa1.1, OsLpa1.2, OsLpa1.3) are produced due to alternative splicing; quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the abundance of OsLpa1.3 was negligible compared with OsLpa1.1 and OsLpa all tissues. OsLpa1.2 is predominant in germinating seeds (about 5 times that of OsLpa1.1), but its abundance decreases quickly with the development of seedlings and plants, whereas the abundance of OsLpa1.1 rises and falls, reaching its highest level in 45-d-old plants, with abundance greater than that of OsLpa both leaves and roots. In seeds, the abundance of OsLpa1 continuously increases with seed growth, being 27.5 and 15 times greater in 28-DAF (day after flowering) seeds than in 7-DAF seeds for OsLpa1.1 and OsLpa1.2, respectively. Transient expression of chimeric genes with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in rice protoplasts demonstrated that all proteins encoded by the three OsLpa1 transcripts are localized to the chloroplast.
26872834	OsCOL10, a CONSTANS-Like Gene, Functions as a Flowering Time Repressor Downstream of Ghd7 in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Flowering time, or heading date, is a critical agronomic trait that determines the cropping season and regional adaptability, and ultimately grain yield in rice. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Here, we report a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10, which encodes a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCOL10 (driven by a strong promoter or by fusing it to the activation domain of VP64) showed delayed flowering time under both short and long days.OsCOL10 is affected by the circadian clock and is preferentially expressed in leaf mesophyll cells; it is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity. Further studies show that OsCOL10 represses the expression of theFT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Transcripts of OsCOL10 are more abundant in plants carrying a functional Ghd7 allele or overexpressing Ghd7 than in Ghd7-deficient plants, thus placing OsCOL10 downstream of Ghd7.Taking these findings together, we conclude that OsCOL10 functions as a flowering time repressor that links Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.
26841113	The Arabidopsis transcriptional regulator DPB3-1 enhances heat stress tolerance without growth retardation in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	The enhancement of heat stress tolerance in crops is an important challenge for food security to facilitate adaptation to global warming. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the transcriptional regulator DNA polymerase II subunit B3-1 (DPB3-1)/nuclear factor Y subunit C10 (NF-YC10) has been reported as a positive regulator of Dehydration-responsive element binding protein 2A (DREB2A), and the overexpression of DPB3-1 enhances heat stress tolerance without growth retardation. Here, we show that DPB3-1 interacts with DREB2A homologues in rice and soya bean. Transactivation analyses with Arabidopsis and rice mesophyll protoplasts indicate that DPB3-1 and its rice homologue OsDPB3-2 function as positive regulators of DREB2A homologues. Overexpression of DPB3-1 did not affect plant growth or yield in rice under nonstress conditions. Moreover, DPB3-1-overexpressing rice showed enhanced heat stress tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed that many heat stress-inducible genes were up-regulated in DPB3-1-overexpressing rice under heat stress conditions. However, the overexpression of DPB3-1 using a constitutive promoter had almost no effect on the expression of these genes under nonstress conditions. This may be because DPB3-1 is a coactivator and thus lacks inherent transcriptional activity. We conclude that DPB3-1, a coactivator that functions specifically under abiotic stress conditions, could be utilized to increase heat stress tolerance in crops without negative effects on vegetative and reproductive growth.
26879413	Rice OsVAMP714, a membrane-trafficking protein localized to the chloroplast and vacuolar membrane, is involved in resistance to rice blast disease.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Membrane trafficking plays pivotal roles in many cellular processes including plant immunity. Here, we report the characterization of OsVAMP714, an intracellular SNARE protein, focusing on its role in resistance to rice blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Disease resistance tests using OsVAMP714 knockdown and overexpressing rice plants demonstrated the involvement of OsVAMP714 in blast resistance. The overexpression of OsVAMP7111, whose product is highly homologous to OsVAMP714, did not enhance blast resistance to rice, implying a potential specificity of OsVAMP714 to blast resistance. OsVAMP714 was localized to the chloroplast in mesophyll cells and to the cellular periphery in epidermal cells of transgenic rice plant leaves. We showed that chloroplast localization is critical for the normal OsVAMP714 functioning in blast resistance by analyzing the rice plants overexpressing OsVAMP714 mutants whose products did not localize in the chloroplast. We also found that OsVAMP714 was located in the vacuolar membrane surrounding the invasive hyphae of M. oryzae. Furthermore, we showed that OsVAMP714 overexpression promotes leaf sheath elongation and that the first 19 amino acids, which are highly conserved between animal and plant VAMP7 proteins, are crucial for normal rice plant growths. Our studies imply that the OsVAMP714-mediated trafficking pathway plays an important role in rice blast resistance as well as in the vegetative growth of rice.
26938582	Characterization of a small acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) from Helianthus annuus L. and its binding affinities.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) bind to acyl-CoA esters and promote their interaction with other proteins, lipids and cell structures. Small class I ACBPs have been identified in different plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana (AtACBP6), Brassica napus (BnACBP) and Oryza sativa (OsACBP1, OsACBP2, OsACBP3), and they are capable of binding to different acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids. Here we characterize HaACBP6, a class I ACBP expressed in sunflower (Helianthus annuus) tissues, studying the specificity of its corresponding recombinant HaACBP6 protein towards various acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids in vitro, particularly using isothermal titration calorimetry and protein phospholipid binding assays. This protein binds with high affinity to de novo synthetized derivatives palmitoly-CoA, stearoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA (Kd 0.29, 0.14 and 0.15 μM respectively). On the contrary, it showed lower affinity towards linoleoyl-CoA (Kd 5.6 μM). Moreover, rHaACBP6 binds to different phosphatidylcholine species (dipalmitoyl-PC, dioleoyl-PC and dilinoleoyl-PC), yet it displays no affinity towards other phospholipids like lyso-PC, phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid derivatives. In the light of these results, the possible involvement of this protein in sunflower oil synthesis is considered.
26869604	Screening Rice Cultivars for Resistance to Bacterial Leaf Blight.	2016	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most serious threats to rice production. In this study, screening of rice for resistance to BLB was carried out at two different times and locations; that is, in a greenhouse during winter and in an open field during summer. The pathogenicity of Xoo race K1 was tested on 32 Korean rice cultivars. Inoculation was conducted at the maximum tillering stage, and the lesion length was measured after 14 days of inoculation. Five cultivars, Hanareum, Namcheon, Samgdeok, Samgang, and Yangjo, were found to be resistant in both the greenhouse and open-field screenings. Expression of the plant defense-related genes JAmyb, OsNPR1, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45, and OsPR10b was observed in resistant and susceptible cultivars by qRT-PCR. Among the five genes tested, only OsPR10b showed coherent expression with the phenotypes. Screening of resistance to Xoo in rice was more accurate when conducted in open fields in the summer cultivation period than in greenhouses in winter. The expression of plant defenserelated genes after bacterial inoculation could give another perspective in elucidating defense mechanisms by using both resistant and susceptible individuals.
26732823	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of phytochrome B.	2016	Biochim Biophys Acta	DREB1/CBF genes, known as major regulators of plant stress responses, are rapidly and transiently induced by low temperatures. Using a yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified a putative Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH Factor (OsPIF14), as binding to the OsDREB1B promoter. bHLH proteins are able to bind to hexameric E-box (CANNTG) or N-box (CACG(A/C)G) motifs, depending on transcriptional activity. We have shown that OsPIF14 binds to the OsDREB1B promoter through two N-boxes and that the flanking regions of the hexameric core are essential for protein-DNA interaction and stability. We also showed that OsPIF14 down-regulates OsDREB1B gene expression in rice protoplasts, corroborating the OsPIF14 repressor activity observed in the transactivation assays using Arabidopsis protoplasts. In addition, we showed that OsPIF14 is indeed a phytochrome interacting factor, which preferentially binds to the active form (Pfr) of rice phytochrome B. This raises the possibility that OsPIF14 activity might be modulated by light. However, we did not observe any regulation of the OsDREB1B gene expression by light under control conditions. Moreover, OsPIF14 gene expression was shown to be modulated by different treatments, such as drought, salt, cold and ABA. Interestingly, OsPIF14 showed also a specific cold-induced alternative splicing. All together, these results suggest the possibility that OsPIF14 is involved in cross-talk between light and stress signaling through interaction with the OsDREB1B promoter. Although in the absence of stress, OsDREB1B gene expression was not regulated by light, given previous reports, it remains possible that OsPIF14 has a role in light modulation of stress responses.
26771167	Rice terpene synthase 24 (OsTPS24) encodes a jasmonate-responsive monoterpene synthase that produces an antibacterial γ-terpinene against rice pathogen.	2016	J Plant Physiol	Rice is one of the most important crops worldwide and is widely used as a model plant for molecular studies of monocotyledonous species. The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in rice-pathogen interactions. In addition, volatile compounds, including terpenes, whose production is induced by JA, are known to be involved in the rice defense system. In this study, we analyzed the JA-induced terpene synthase OsTPS24 in rice. We found that OsTPS24 was localized in chloroplasts and produced a monoterpene, γ-terpinene. The amount of γ-terpinene increased after JA treatment. γ-Terpinene had significant antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo); however, it did not show significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. The antibacterial activity of the γ-terpinene against Xoo was caused by damage to bacterial cell membranes. These results suggest that γ-terpinene plays an important role in JA-induced resistance against Xoo, and that it functions as an antibacterial compound in rice.
27095397	OsBBX14 delays heading date by repressing florigen gene expression under long and short-day conditions in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	B-box (BBX) proteins are zinc finger proteins containing B-box domains, which have roles in Arabidopsis growth and development. However, little is known concerning rice BBXs. Herein, we identified a rice BBX protein, Oryza sativa BBX14 (OsBBX14). OsBBX14 is highly expressed in flag leaf blades. OsBBX14 expression shows a diurnal rhythm under photoperiodic conditions and subsequent continuous white light. OsBBX14 is located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation potential. OsBBX14-overexpression (OsBBX14-OX) lines exhibited delayed heading date under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions, whereas RNAi lines of OsBBX14 lines had similar heading dates to the WT. The florigen genes, Hd3a and RFT1, were downregulated in the OsBBX14-OX lines under LD and SD conditions. Under LD conditions, Hd1 was expressed higher in the OsBBX14-OX lines than in the wild type (WT), and the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes, OsLHY and OsPRR1, was changed in OsBBX14-OX lines. Thus, OsBBX14 acts as a floral repressor by promoting Hd1 expression under LD conditions, probably because of crosstalk with the circadian clock. Under SD conditions, Ehd1 expression was reduced in OsBBX14-OX lines, but Hd1 and circadian clock gene expressions were unaffected, indicating that OsBBX14 acts as a repressor of Ehd1. Our findings suggested that OsBBX14 regulates heading date differently under LD and SD conditions.
26833031	Phylogenetic analysis and protein structure modelling identifies distinct Ca(2+)/Cation antiporters and conservation of gene family structure within Arabidopsis and rice species.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The Ca(2+)/Cation Antiporter (CaCA) superfamily is an ancient and widespread family of ion-coupled cation transporters found in nearly all kingdoms of life. In animals, K(+)-dependent and K(+)-indendent Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCKX and NCX) are important CaCA members. Recently it was proposed that all rice and Arabidopsis CaCA proteins should be classified as NCX proteins. Here we performed phylogenetic analysis of CaCA genes and protein structure homology modelling to further characterise members of this transporter superfamily.

FINDINGS: Phylogenetic analysis of rice and Arabidopsis CaCAs in comparison with selected CaCA members from non-plant species demonstrated that these genes form clearly distinct families, with the H(+)/Cation exchanger (CAX) and cation/Ca(2+) exchanger (CCX) families dominant in higher plants but the NCKX and NCX families absent. NCX-related Mg(2+)/H(+) exchanger (MHX) and CAX-related Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger-like (NCL) proteins are instead present. Analysis of genomes of ten closely-related rice species and four Arabidopsis-related species found that CaCA gene family structures are highly conserved within related plants, apart from minor variation. Protein structures were modelled for OsCAX1a and OsMHX1. Despite exhibiting broad structural conservation, there are clear structural differences observed between the different CaCA types.

CONCLUSIONS: Members of the CaCA superfamily form clearly distinct families with different phylogenetic, structural and functional characteristics, and therefore should not be simply classified as NCX proteins, which should remain as a separate gene family.
26869703	SUMO Is a Critical Regulator of Salt Stress Responses in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) conjugation onto target proteins has emerged as a very influential class of protein modification systems. SUMO1/2 double mutant plants are nonviable, underlining the importance of SUMO conjugation to plant survival. Once covalently bound, SUMO can alter a conjugated protein's stability and/or function. SUMO conjugation is a highly dynamic process that can be rapidly reversed by the action of SUMO proteases. The balance between the conjugated/deconjugated forms is a major determinant in the modulation of SUMO-target function. Despite the important mechanistic role of SUMO proteases in model plants, until now the identity or the function of these regulatory enzymes has not been defined in any crop plant. In this report, we reveal the ubiquitin-like protease class of SUMO protease gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) and demonstrate a critical role for OsOTS1 SUMO protease in salt stress. OsOTS-RNAi rice plants accumulate high levels of SUMO-conjugated proteins during salt stress and are highly salt sensitive; however, in non-salt conditions, they are developmentally indistinguishable from wild-type plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsOTS1 have increased salt tolerance and a concomitant reduction in the levels of SUMOylated proteins. We demonstrate that OsOTS1 confers salt tolerance in rice by increasing root biomass. High salinity triggers OsOTS1 degradation, indicating that increased SUMO conjugation in rice plants during salt stress is in part achieved by down-regulation of OTS1/2 activity. OsOTS1 is nuclear localized indicating a direct requirement of OsOTS1-dependent deSUMOylation activity in rice nuclei for salt tolerance.
26918637	OsCLT1, a CRT-like transporter 1, is required for glutathione homeostasis and arsenic tolerance in rice.	2016	New Phytol	Arsenic (As) contamination in a paddy environment can cause phytotoxicity and elevated As accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa). The mechanism of As detoxification in rice is still poorly understood. We isolated an arsenate (As(V))-sensitive mutant of rice. Genomic resequencing and complementation identified OsCLT1, encoding a CRT-like transporter, as the causal gene for the mutant phenotype. OsCLT1 is localized to the envelope membrane of plastids. The glutathione and γ-glutamylcysteine contents in roots of Osclt1 and RNA interference lines were decreased markedly compared with the wild-type (WT). The concentrations of phytochelatin PC2 in Osclt1 roots were only 32% and 12% of that in WT after As(V) and As(III) treatments, respectively. OsCLT1 mutation resulted in lower As accumulation in roots but higher As accumulation in shoots when exposed to As(V). Under As(III) treatment, Osclt1 accumulated a lower As concentration in roots but similar As concentration in shoots to WT. Further analysis showed that the reduction of As(V) to As(III) was decreased in Osclt1. Osclt1 was also hypersensitive to cadmium (Cd). These results indicate that OsCLT1 plays an important role in glutathione homeostasis, probably by mediating the export of γ-glutamylcysteine and glutathione from plastids to the cytoplasm, which in turn affects As and Cd detoxification in rice.
26920613	A rice LSD1-like-type ZFP gene OsLOL5 enhances saline-alkaline tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast and rice.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) play an important role in regulating plant responses to abiotic stress. However, little is known about the function of LSD1-like-type ZFP in saline-alkaline (SA) stress resistance of rice. In this study, OsLOL5 (GenBank No. AJ620677), containing two LSD1-like-type C2C2 domains, was isolated and analyzed its protection roles in transgenic plants and yeast. OsLOL5 was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells.

RESULTS: OsLOL5 expression significantly increased in rice leaves and roots under 150 mmol L-1 NaCl, 30 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mmol L-1 H2O2 treatment, respectively. Overexpression of OsLOL5 in yeast resulted in SA tolerance at significant level. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsLOL5 grew well in the presence of both NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death. SA stress caused significant changes in the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in non-transgenic plants compared with those in transgenic lines. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsLOL5 exhibited stronger resistance than NT under NaHCO3 treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight. The genes associated with oxidative stress, such as OsAPX2, OsCAT, OsCu/Zn-SOD, and OsRGRC2, were significantly upregulated in OsLOL5-overexpressing rice. The results suggested that OsLOL5 improved SA tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway.

CONCLUSIONS: The yeast INVScI bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under NaCl, NaHCO3, and H2O2 treatments. These findings illustrated that OsLOL5 overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for SA stress through active oxygen species. The present study showed that the OsLOL5 genes involved in the ROS signaling pathways may combine with the model plant Arabidopsis and rice in LDS1-type ZFP by ROS signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis. We speculated that the OsLOL5 active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles. The present study further revealed that OsLOL5 ZFP could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
26839129	WHITE PANICLE1, a Val-tRNA Synthetase Regulating Chloroplast Ribosome Biogenesis in Rice, Is Essential for Early Chloroplast Development.	2016	Plant Physiol	Chloroplasts and mitochondria contain their own genomes and transcriptional and translational systems. Establishing these genetic systems is essential for plant growth and development. Here we characterized a mutant form of a Val-tRNA synthetase (OsValRS2) from Oryza sativa that is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria. A single base change in OsValRS2 caused virescent to albino phenotypes in seedlings and white panicles at heading. We therefore named this mutant white panicle 1 (wp1). Chlorophyll autofluorescence observations and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that wp1 mutants are defective in early chloroplast development. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes is significantly repressed, while expression of many chloroplast-encoded genes also changed significantly in wp1 mutants. Western-blot analyses of chloroplast-encoded proteins showed that chloroplast protein levels were reduced in wp1 mutants, although mRNA levels of some genes were higher in wp1 than in wild type. We found that wp1 was impaired in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis. Taken together, our results show that OsValRS2 plays an essential role in chloroplast development and regulating chloroplast ribosome biogenesis.
26874295	Molecular and biochemical characterization of rice pectin methylesterase inhibitors (OsPMEIs).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Cell wall modifications such as partial degradation and depolymerization by cell wall hydrolases are normal cellular processes and are required for the functionalities of different cell types. Pectin, one of the major cell wall polysaccharides, is predominantly found in primary cell walls and middle lamellae and is subjected to in muro modification, primarily by cell wall-localized pectin methylesterases (PMEs). Molecular biochemical studies have demonstrated that enzymatic activities of PMEs are governed by multiple pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs), which consequently control the pectin methylesterification status. Although a few studies in Arabidopsis have shown the importance of this PMEI-mediated regulation in the biophysical properties of cell walls, little is known about the molecular physiological functions of rice PMEIs. We found 49 members of the PMEI family in the rice genome. Analysis of their transcript levels by quantitative real-time PCR and meta expression analysis showed that they are regulated spatially and temporally, as well as in response to diverse stresses. Quantification of cell wall-bound methylesters indicated that the degree of pectin methylesterification is developmentally regulated; in particular, higher PMEI activities were detected in cell wall proteins prepared from young leaves. Furthermore, an activity assay demonstrated that two recombinant OsPMEI proteins (OsPMEI8 and 12) were able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of a commercial PME protein. Subcellular localization indicated that OsPMEI8 is targeted to the middle lamella and OsPMEI12 is localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus. Taken together, our findings provide the first molecular and biochemical evidence for functional characterization of PMEIs in rice growth and development.
26902738	Enhanced Boron Tolerance in Plants Mediated by Bidirectional Transport Through Plasma Membrane Intrinsic Proteins.	2016	Sci Rep	High boron (B) concentration is toxic to plants that limit plant productivity. Recent studies have shown the involvement of the members of major intrinsic protein (MIP) family in controlling B transport. Here, we have provided experimental evidences showing the bidirectional transport activity of rice OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6. Boron transport ability of OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6 were displayed in yeast HD9 mutant strain (∆fps1∆acr3∆ycf1) as a result of increased B sensitivity, influx and accumulation by OsPIP1;3, and rapid efflux activity by OsPIP2;6. RT-PCR analysis showed strong upregulation of OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6 transcripts in roots by B toxicity. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6 exhibited enhanced tolerance to B toxicity. Furthermore, B concentration was significantly increased after 2 and 3 hours of tracer boron ((10)B) treatment. Interestingly, a rapid efflux of (10)B from the roots of the transgenic plants was observed within 1 h of (10)B treatment. Boron tolerance in OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6 lines was inhibited by aquaporin inhibitors, silver nitrate and sodium azide. Our data proved that OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;6 are indeed involved in both influx and efflux of boron transport. Manipulation of these PIPs could be highly useful in improving B tolerance in crops grown in high B containing soils.
27200061	Comprehensive Analysis and Expression Profiling of the OsLAX and OsABCB Auxin Transporter Gene Families in Rice (Oryza sativa) under Phytohormone Stimuli and Abiotic Stresses.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The plant hormone auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and developmental processes. Auxin gradient is formed in plant as a result of polar auxin transportation by three types of auxin transporters such as OsLAX, OsPIN, and OsABCB. We report here the analysis of two rice auxin transporter gene families, OsLAX and OsABCB, using bioinformatics tools, publicly accessible microarray data, and quantitative RT-PCR. There are 5 putative OsLAXs and 22 putative OsABCBs in rice genome, which were mapped on 8 chromosomes. The exon-intron structure of OsLAX genes and properties of deduced proteins were relatively conserved within grass family, while that of OsABCB genes varied greatly. Both constitutive and organ/tissue specific expression patterns were observed in OsLAXs and OsABCBs. Analysis of evolutionarily closely related "gene pairs" together with organ/tissue specific expression revealed possible "function gaining" and "function losing" events during rice evolution. Most OsLAX and OsABCB genes were regulated by drought and salt stress, as well as hormonal stimuli [auxin and Abscisic Acid (ABA)], which suggests extensive crosstalk between abiotic stresses and hormone signaling pathways. The existence of large number of auxin and stress related cis-regulatory elements in promoter regions might account for their massive responsiveness of these genes to these environmental stimuli, indicating complexity of regulatory networks involved in various developmental and physiological processes. The comprehensive analysis of OsLAX and OsABCB auxin transporter genes in this study would be helpful for understanding the biological significance of these gene families in hormone signaling and adaptation of rice plants to unfavorable environments.
26754793	Functional conservation of rice OsNF-YB/YC and Arabidopsis AtNF-YB/YC proteins in the regulation of flowering time.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Rice Os NF - YB and Os NF - YC complement the late flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis nf - yb double and nf - yc triple mutants, respectively. In addition, OsNF-YB and OsNF-YC interact with AtNF-YC and AtNF-YB, respectively. Plant NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factors play important roles in plant development and abiotic stress. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two NF-YB (AtNF-YB2 and AtNF-YB3) and five NF-YC (AtNF-YC1, AtNF-YC2, AtNF-YC3, AtNF-YC4, and AtNF-YC9) genes regulate photoperiodic flowering by interacting with other AtNF-Y subunit proteins. Three rice NF-YB (OsNF-YB8, OsNF-YB10, and OsNF-YB11) and five rice OsNF-YC (OsNF-YC1, OsNF-YC2, OsNF-YC4, OsNF-YC6, and OsNF-YC7) genes are clustered with two AtNF-YB and five AtNF-YC genes, respectively. To investigate the functional conservation of these NF-YB and NF-YC genes in rice and Arabidopsis, we analyzed the flowering phenotypes of transgenic plants overexpressing the respective OsNF-YB and OsNF-YC genes in Arabidopsis mutants. Overexpression of OsNF-YB8/10/11 and OsNF-YC2 complemented the late flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis nf-yb2 nf-yb3 and nf-yc3 nf-yc4 nf-yc9 mutants, respectively. The rescued phenotype of 35S::OsNF-YC2 nf-yc3 nf-yc4 nf-yc9 plants was attributed to the upregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). In vitro and in planta protein-protein analyses revealed that OsNF-YB8/10/11 and OsNF-YC1/2/4/6/7 interact with AtNF-YC3/4/9 and AtNF-YB2/3, respectively. Our data indicate that some OsNF-YB and OsNF-YC genes are functional equivalents of AtNF-YB2/3 and AtNF-YC3/4/9 genes, respectively, and suggest functional conservation of Arabidopsis and rice NF-Y genes in the control of flowering time.
26810875	Physiological Responses and Expression Profile of NADPH Oxidase in Rice (Oryza Sativa) Seedlings under Different Levels of Submergence.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Flooding due to global climate change is a serious problem that frequently decreases crop yields. Rice fields in flood-prone areas often experience full or partial submergence. Submergence has an adverse effect on internal oxygen availability, sugar status and survival. Complete submergence imposes severe pressure on plants, principally because the excess water in their surroundings deprives them of certain basic resources such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and light for photosynthesis. To better understand the mechanisms involved under different levels of flooding, it is necessary to further observe physiological responses and to identify the Rboh genes involved and determine how they are regulated during submergence.

RESULTS: In this study, significant physiological changes were observed in plant height, leaf sheath elongation and chlorophyll a, b and total content under partial and full submergence treatments. Senescence-regulating genes were severely affected under full submergence. Additionally, intracellular oxidative homeostasis was disrupted by overproduction of H2O2 and O2 (-), which affected cell viability and antioxidant enzyme activity, under different levels of submergence. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that complex regulation of Rboh genes is involved under different levels of submergence.

CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the effect of physiological and the transcript levels of OsRboh genes were presented different responses to different levels of submergence in rice seedlings. There have different mechanism in intracellular to response different levels of submergence. Finally we discuss effects of the regulation of OsRboh expression and ROS production which was important to maintain homeostasis to help rice seedlings face different levels of submergence.
26775680	Structural understanding of the recycling of oxidized ascorbate by dehydroascorbate reductase (OsDHAR) from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2016	Sci Rep	Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) is a key enzyme involved in the recycling of ascorbate, which catalyses the glutathione (GSH)-dependent reduction of oxidized ascorbate (dehydroascorbate, DHA). As a result, DHAR regenerates a pool of reduced ascorbate and detoxifies reactive oxygen species (ROS). In previous experiments involving transgenic rice, we observed that overexpression of DHAR enhanced grain yield and biomass. Since the structure of DHAR is not available, the enzymatic mechanism is not well-understood and remains poorly characterized. To elucidate the molecular basis of DHAR catalysis, we determined the crystal structures of DHAR from Oryza sativa L. japonica (OsDHAR) in the native, ascorbate-bound, and GSH-bound forms and refined their resolutions to 1.9, 1.7, and 1.7 Å, respectively. These complex structures provide the first information regarding the location of the ascorbate and GSH binding sites and their interacting residues. The location of the ascorbate-binding site overlaps with the GSH-binding site, suggesting a ping-pong kinetic mechanism for electron transfer at the common Cys20 active site. Our structural information and mutagenesis data provide useful insights into the reaction mechanism of OsDHAR against ROS-induced oxidative stress in rice.
27064905	Cupincin: A Unique Protease Purified from Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bran Is a New Member of the Cupin Superfamily.	2016	PLoS One	Cupin superfamily is one of the most diverse super families. This study reports the purification and characterization of a novel cupin domain containing protease from rice bran for the first time. Hypothetical protein OsI_13867 was identified and named as cupincin. Cupincin was purified to 4.4 folds with a recovery of 4.9%. Cupincin had an optimum pH and temperature of pH 4.0 and 60 °C respectively. Cupincin was found to be a homotrimer, consisting of three distinct subunits with apparent molecular masses of 33.45 kDa, 22.35 kDa and 16.67 kDa as determined by MALDI-TOF, whereas it eluted as a single unit with an apparent molecular mass of 135.33 ± 3.52 kDa in analytical gel filtration and migrated as a single band in native page, suggesting its homogeneity. Sequence identity of cupincin was deduced by determining the amino-terminal sequence of the polypeptide chains and by and de novo sequencing. For understanding the hydrolysing mechanism of cupincin, its three-dimensional model was developed. Structural analysis indicated that cupincin contains His313, His326 and Glu318 with zinc ion as the putative active site residues, inhibition of enzyme activity by 1,10-phenanthroline and atomic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the presence of zinc ion. The cleavage specificity of cupincin towards oxidized B-chain of insulin was highly specific; cleaving at the Leu15-Tyr16 position, the specificity was also determined using neurotensin as a substrate, where it cleaved only at the Glu1-Tyr2 position. Limited proteolysis of the protease suggests a specific function for cupincin. These results demonstrated cupincin as a completely new protease.
26959651	Enhanced Gene Expression Rather than Natural Polymorphism in Coding Sequence of the OsbZIP23 Determines Drought Tolerance and Yield Improvement in Rice Genotypes.	2016	PLoS One	Drought is one of the major limiting factors for productivity of crops including rice (Oryza sativa L.). Understanding the role of allelic variations of key regulatory genes involved in stress-tolerance is essential for developing an effective strategy to combat drought. The bZIP transcription factors play a crucial role in abiotic-stress adaptation in plants via abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. The present study aimed to search for allelic polymorphism in the OsbZIP23 gene across selected drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice genotypes, and to characterize the new allele through overexpression (OE) and gene-silencing (RNAi). Analyses of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the cloned OsbZIP23 gene revealed single nucleotide polymorphism at four places and a 15-nucleotide deletion at one place. The single-copy OsbZIP23 gene is expressed at relatively higher level in leaf tissues of drought-tolerant genotypes, and its abundance is more in reproductive stage. Cloning and sequence analyses of the OsbZIP23-promoter from drought-tolerant O. rufipogon and drought-sensitive IR20 cultivar showed variation in the number of stress-responsive cis-elements and a 35-nucleotide deletion at 5'-UTR in IR20. Analysis of the GFP reporter gene function revealed that the promoter activity of O. rufipogon is comparatively higher than that of IR20. The overexpression of any of the two polymorphic forms (1083 bp and 1068 bp CDS) of OsbZIP23 improved drought tolerance and yield-related traits significantly by retaining higher content of cellular water, soluble sugar and proline; and exhibited decrease in membrane lipid peroxidation in comparison to RNAi lines and non-transgenic plants. The OE lines showed higher expression of target genes-OsRab16B, OsRab21 and OsLEA3-1 and increased ABA sensitivity; indicating that OsbZIP23 is a positive transcriptional-regulator of the ABA-signaling pathway. Taken together, the present study concludes that the enhanced gene expression rather than natural polymorphism in coding sequence of OsbZIP23 is accountable for improved drought tolerance and yield performance in rice genotypes.
26744119	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	FRIZZLE PANICLE (FZP) and RFL/ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) play important roles in regulating the ABCDE floral organ identity genes. However, the relationships among FZP and these floral identity genes in the regulation of panicle formation remain unclear. Here, we used the novel mutant fzp-11, wild-type and FZP-overexpressing plants to compare the expression of these genes during panicle development by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. The results indicate that FZP is a major negative regulator of RFL/APO2 and determines the transition from panicle branching to spikelet formation. Moreover, overexpression of FZP severely represses axillary meristem formation in both the vegetative and reproductive phases and the outgrowth of secondary branches in panicle. FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM). Thus, it suggested that FZP could specify floral organ identity by regulating the related OsMADS-box genes.
26826052	Agronomic nitrogen-use efficiency of rice can be increased by driving OsNRT2.1 expression with the OsNAR2.1 promoter.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	The importance of the nitrate (NO3-) transporter for yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) in rice was previously demonstrated using map-based cloning. In this study, we enhanced the expression of the OsNRT2.1 gene, which encodes a high-affinity NO3- transporter, using a ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter and the NO3--inducible promoter of the OsNAR2.1 gene to drive OsNRT2.1 expression in transgenic rice plants. Transgenic lines expressing pUbi:OsNRT2.1 or pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 constructs exhibited the increased total biomass including yields of approximately 21% and 38% compared with wild-type (WT) plants. The agricultural NUE (ANUE) of the pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines decreased to 83% of that of the WT plants, while the ANUE of the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines increased to 128% of that of the WT plants. The dry matter transfer into grain decreased by 68% in the pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines and increased by 46% in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines relative to the WT. The expression of OsNRT2.1 in shoot and grain showed that Ubi enhanced OsNRT2.1 expression by 7.5-fold averagely and OsNAR2.1 promoters increased by about 80% higher than the WT. Interestingly, we found that the OsNAR2.1 was expressed higher in all the organs of pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines; however, for pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines, OsNAR2.1 expression was only increased in root, leaf sheaths and internodes. We show that increased expression of OsNRT2.1, especially driven by OsNAR2.1 promoter, can improve the yield and NUE in rice.
26795142	OsVIL1 controls flowering time in rice by suppressing OsLF under short days and by inducing Ghd7 under long days.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsVIL1 is associated with a PRC2-like complex through its fibronectin type III domain to activate flowering by suppressing OsLF under SD and delay flowering by inducing Ghd7 under LD. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) inhibits the expression of target genes by modifying histone proteins. Although several genes that epigenetically regulate flowering time have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), the molecular mechanism by which PRC2 affects flowering time has not been well understood in rice. We investigated the role of Oryza sativa VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (OsVIL1), which is homologous to the flowering promoter OsVIL2. The reduction in OsVIL1 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) caused a late flowering phenotype under short days (SD). In the RNAi lines, OsLF expression was increased, but transcripts of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) were reduced. By contrast, OsVIL1-overexpressing (OX) transgenic lines displayed an early flowering phenotype under SD. Levels of OsLF transcript were reduced while those of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were enhanced in the OX lines. Under long days (LD), the OsVIL1-OX lines flowered late and Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) expression was higher. We also demonstrated that the plant homeodomain region of OsVIL1 binds to native histone H3 in vitro. Our co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsVIL1 interacts with OsVIL2 and that the fibronectin type III domain of OsVIL1 is associated with O. sativa EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2b (OsEMF2b). We propose that OsVIL1 forms a PRC2-like complex to induce flowering by suppressing OsLF under SD but delay flowering by elevating Ghd7 expression under LD.
26758286	Ectopic expression of R3 MYB transcription factor gene OsTCL1 in Arabidopsis, but not rice, affects trichome and root hair formation.	2016	Sci Rep	In Arabidopsis, a MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) transcriptional activator complex activates the homeodomain protein gene GLABRA2 (GL2), leading to the promotion of trichome formation and inhibition of root hair formation. The same MBW complex also activates single-repeat R3 MYB genes. R3 MYBs in turn, play a negative feedback role by competing with R2R3 MYB proteins for binding bHLH proteins, thus blocking the formation of the MBW complex. By BLASTing the rice (Oryza sativa) protein database using the entire amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis R3 MYB transcription factor TRICHOMELESS1 (TCL1), we found that there are two genes in rice genome encoding R3 MYB transcription factors, namely Oryza sativa TRICHOMELESS1 (OsTCL1) and OsTCL2. Expressing OsTCL1 in Arabidopsis inhibited trichome formation and promoted root hair formation, and OsTCL1 interacted with GL3 when tested in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Consistent with these observations, expression levels of GL2, R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene GLABRA1 (GL1) and several R3 MYB genes were greatly reduced, indicating that OsTCL1 is functional R3 MYB. However, trichome and root hair formation in transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTCL1 remained largely unchanged, and elevated expression of OsGL2 was observed in the transgenic rice plants, indicating that rice may use different mechanisms to regulate trichome formation.
27055010	Phosphatidylserine Synthase Controls Cell Elongation Especially in the Uppermost Internode in Rice by Regulation of Exocytosis.	2016	PLoS One	The uppermost internode is one of the fastest elongating organs in rice, and is expected to require an adequate supply of cell-wall materials and enzymes to the cell surface to enhance mechanical strength. Although it has been reported that the phenotype of shortened uppermost internode 1 (sui1) is caused by mutations in PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE SYNTHASE (OsPSS), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that the OsPSS-1, as a gene expressed predominantly in elongating cells, regulates post-Golgi vesicle secretion to intercellular spaces. Mutation of OsPSS-1 leads to compromised delivery of CESA4 and secGFP towards the cell surface, resulting in weakened intercellular adhesion and disorganized cell arrangement in parenchyma. The phenotype of sui1-4 is caused largely by the reduction in cellulose contents in the whole plant and detrimental delivery of pectins in the uppermost internode. We found that OsPSS-1 and its potential product PS (phosphatidylserine) localized to organelles associated with exocytosis. These results together suggest that OsPSS-1 plays a potential role in mediating cell expansion by regulating secretion of cell wall components.
26973672	Overexpression of Peptide-Encoding OsCEP6.1 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Growth in Rice (O. sativa).	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plant peptide hormones play an important role in regulating plant developmental programs via cell-to-cell communication in a non-cell autonomous manner. To characterize the biological relevance of C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) genes in rice, we performed a genome-wide search against public databases using a bioinformatics approach and identified six additional CEP members. Expression analysis revealed a spatial-temporal pattern of OsCEP6.1 gene in different tissues and at different developmental stages of panicle. Interestingly, the expression level of the OsCEP6.1 was also significantly up-regulated by exogenous cytokinin. Application of a chemically synthesized 15-amino acid OsCEP6.1 peptide showed that OsCEP6.1 had a negative role in regulating root and seedling growth, which was further confirmed by transgenic lines. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of OsCEP6.1 was sufficient to lead to panicle architecture and grain size variations. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the phenotypic variation of OsCEP6.1 overexpression lines resulted from decreased cell size but not reduced cell number. Moreover, starch accumulation was not significantly affected. Taken together, these data suggest that the OsCEP6.1 peptide might be involved in regulating the development of panicles and grains in rice.
27148296	Mutation of OsGIGANTEA Leads to Enhanced Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Generated Osmotic Stress in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Water deficit is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant growth and crop yield. While the identification of many key factors involved in the plant water deficit response has greatly increased our knowledge about the regulation system, the mechanisms underlying dehydration tolerance in plants are still not well understood. In our current study, we investigated the roles of the key flowering time regulator, OsGIGANTEA (OsGI), in the osmotic stress tolerance in rice. Results showed that mutation of OsGI conferred tolerance to osmotic stress generated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), increased proline and sucrose contents, and accelerated stomata movement. In addition, qRT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the transcript abundance of some osmotic stress response genes, such as OsDREB1E, OsAP37, OsAP59, OsLIP9, OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, and OsSalT, was significantly higher in osgi than in WT plants, suggesting that OsGI might be a negative regulator in the osmotic stress response in rice.
27200067	OsGatB, the Subunit of tRNA-Dependent Amidotransferase, Is Required for Primary Root Development in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	A short-root rice mutant was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate-mutagenized library. From map-based cloning strategy, a point mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from proline to leucine, was identified in the fourth exon of a glutamyl-tRNA (Gln) amidotransferase B subunit family protein (OsGatB, LOC_Os11g34210). This gene is an ortholog of Arabidopsis GatB and yeast PET112. GatB is a subunit of tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), an essential enzyme involved in Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis in mitochondria. Although previous studies have described that cessation in mitochondrial translation is lethal at very early developmental stages in plants, this point mutation resulted in a non-lethal phenotype of smaller root meristem and shorter root cell length. In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there. OsGatB was localized in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial structure and function were all affected in Osgatb root tip cells.
26870074	OsSRO1a Interacts with RNA Binding Domain-Containing Protein (OsRBD1) and Functions in Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Yeast.	2016	Front Plant Sci	SRO1 is an important regulator of stress and hormonal response in plants and functions by interacting with transcription factors and several other proteins involved in abiotic stress response. In the present study, we report OsRBD1, an RNA binding domain 1- containing protein as a novel interacting partner of OsSRO1a from rice. The interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 was shown in yeast as well as in planta. Domain-domain interaction study revealed that C-terminal RST domain of OsSRO1a interacts with the N-terminal RRM1 domain of OsRBD1 protein. Both the proteins were found to co-localize in nucleus. Transcript profiling under different stress conditions revealed co-regulation of OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 expression under some abiotic stress conditions. Further, co-transformation of both OsSRO1a and OsRBD1 in yeast conferred enhanced tolerance toward salinity, osmotic, and methylglyoxal treatments. Our study suggests that the interaction of OsSRO1a with OsRBD1 confers enhanced stress tolerance in yeast and may play an important role under abiotic stress responses in plants.
27200010	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit f (OseIF3f) Is Involved in Microgametogenesis.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Microgametogenesis is the post-meiotic pollen developmental phase when unicellular microspores develop into mature tricellular pollen. In rice, microgametogenesis can influence grain yields to a great degree because pollen abortion occurs more easily during microgametogenesis than during other stages of pollen development. However, our knowledge of the genes involved in microgametogenesis in rice remains limited. Due to the dependence of pollen development on the regulatory mechanisms of protein expression, we identified the encoding gene of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit f in Oryza sativa (OseIF3f). Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry confirmed that OseIF3f was a subunit of rice eIF3, which consisted of at least 12 subunits including eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3f, eIF3g, eIF3h, eIF3i, eIF3k, eIF3l, and eIF3m. OseIF3f showed high mRNA levels in immature florets and is highly abundant in developing anthers. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OseIF3f was localized to the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum in rice root cells. We further analyzed the biological function of OseIF3f using the double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) approach. The OseIF3f-RNAi lines grew normally at the vegetative stage but displayed a large reduction in seed production and pollen viability, which is associated with the down-regulation of OseIF3f. Further cytological observations of pollen development revealed that the OseIF3f-RNAi lines showed no obvious abnormalities at the male meiotic stage and the unicellular microspore stage. However, compared to the wild-type, OseIF3f-RNAi lines contained a higher percentage of arrested unicellular pollen at the bicellular stage and a higher percentage of arrested unicellular and bicellular pollen, and aborted pollen at the tricellular stage. These results indicate that OseIF3f plays a role in microgametogenesis.
26834774	Overexpression of a Stress-Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Gene ONAC022 Improves Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The NAC transcription factors play critical roles in regulating stress responses in plants. However, the functions for many of the NAC family members in rice are yet to be identified. In the present study, a novel stress-responsive rice NAC gene, ONAC022, was identified. Expression of ONAC022 was induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA). The ONAC022 protein was found to bind specifically to a canonical NAC recognition cis-element sequence and showed transactivation activity at its C-terminus in yeast. The ONAC022 protein was localized to nucleus when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Three independent transgenic rice lines with overexpression of ONAC022 were generated and used to explore the function of ONAC022 in drought and salt stress tolerance. Under drought stress condition in greenhouse, soil-grown ONAC022-overexpressing (N22oe) transgenic rice plants showed an increased drought tolerance, leading to higher survival ratios and better growth than wild-type (WT) plants. When grown hydroponically in Hogland solution supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, the N22oe plants displayed an enhanced salt tolerance and accumulated less Na(+) in roots and shoots as compared to WT plants. Under drought stress condition, the N22oe plants exhibited decreased rates of water loss and transpiration, reduced percentage of open stomata and increased contents of proline and soluble sugars. However, the N22oe lines showed increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA at seed germination and seedling growth stages but contained higher level of endogenous ABA. Expression of some ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCEDs and OsPSY), signaling and regulatory genes (OsPP2C02, OsPP2C49, OsPP2C68, OsbZIP23, OsAP37, OsDREB2a, and OsMYB2), and late stress-responsive genes (OsRAB21, OsLEA3, and OsP5CS1) was upregulated in N22oe plants. Our data demonstrate that ONAC022 functions as a stress-responsive NAC with transcriptional activator activity and plays a positive role in drought and salt stress tolerance through modulating an ABA-mediated pathway.
26748915	The plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm: catalytic properties at low temperature.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Consistent with its essential role in starch biosynthesis at low temperatures, the plastidial starch phosphorylase from rice endosperm is highly active at low temperature. Moreover, contrary to results on other higher plant phosphorylases, the L80 peptide, a domain unique to plant phosphorylases and not present in orthologous phosphorylases from other organisms, is not involved in enzyme catalysis. Starch phosphorylase (Pho) is an essential enzyme in starch synthesis in developing rice endosperm as the enzyme plays a critical role in both the early and maturation phases of starch granule formation especially at low temperature. In this study, we demonstrated that the rice Pho1 maintains substantial enzyme activity at low temperature (<20 °C) and its substrate affinities for branched α-glucans and glucose-1-phosphate were significantly increased at the lower reaction temperatures. Under sub-saturating substrate conditions, OsPho1 displayed higher catalytic activities at 18 °C than at optimal 36 °C, supporting the prominent role of the enzyme in starch synthesis at low temperature. Removal of the highly charged 80-amino acid sequence L80 peptide, a region found exclusively in the plastidial Pho1 of higher plants, did not significantly alter the catalytic and regulatory properties of OsPho1 but did affect heat stability. Our kinetic results support the low temperature biosynthetic role of OsPho1 in rice endosperm and indicate that its L80 region is unlikely to have a direct enzymatic role but provides stability of the enzyme under heat stress.
26747563	Comparative Study of Early Cold-Regulated Proteins by Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis Reveals a Key Role for Phospholipase Dα1 in Mediating Cold Acclimation Signaling Pathway in Rice.	2016	Mol Cell Proteomics	To understand the early signaling steps that regulate cold responses in rice, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE)(1)was used to study early cold-regulated proteins in rice seedlings. Using mass spectrometry, 32 spots, which represent 26 unique proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min of cold treatment were identified. Among these proteins, Western blot analyses confirmed that the cellular phospholipase D α1 (OsPLDα1) protein level was increased as early as 1 min after cold treatment. Genetic studies showed that reducing the expression ofOsPLDα1makes rice plants more sensitive to chilling stress as well as cold acclimation increased freezing tolerance. Correspondingly, cold-regulated proteomic changes and the expression of the cold-responsive C repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding 1 (OsDREB1) family of transcription factors were inhibited in thepldα1mutant. We also found that the expression ofOsPLDα1is directly regulated by OsDREB1A. This transcriptional regulation ofOsPLDα1could provide positive feedback regulation of the cold signal transduction pathway in rice. OsPLDα1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce the signal molecule phosphatidic acid (PA). By lipid-overlay assay, we demonstrated that the rice cold signaling proteins, MAP kinase 6 (OsMPK6) and OsSIZ1, bind directly to PA. Taken together, our results suggest that OsPLDα1 plays a key role in transducing cold signaling in rice by producing PA and regulatingOsDREB1s' expression by OsMPK6, OsSIZ1, and possibly other PA-binding proteins.
26812961	Wood reinforcement of poplar by rice NAC transcription factor.	2016	Sci Rep	Lignocellulose, composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, in the secondary cell wall constitutes wood and is the most abundant form of biomass on Earth. Enhancement of wood accumulation may be an effective strategy to increase biomass as well as wood strength, but currently only limited research has been undertaken. Here, we demonstrated that OsSWN1, the orthologue of the rice NAC Secondary-wall Thickening factor (NST) transcription factor, effectively enhanced secondary cell wall formation in the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem and poplar (Populus tremula×Populus tremuloides) stem when expressed by the Arabidopsis NST3 promoter. Interestingly, in transgenic Arabidopsis and poplar, ectopic secondary cell wall deposition in the pith area was observed in addition to densification of the secondary cell wall in fiber cells. The cell wall content or density of the stem increased on average by up to 38% and 39% in Arabidopsis and poplar, respectively, without causing growth inhibition. As a result, physical strength of the stem increased by up to 57% in poplar. Collectively, these data suggest that the reinforcement of wood by NST3pro:OsSWN1 is a promising strategy to enhance wood-biomass production in dicotyledonous plant species.
26798026	Duplication of OsHAP family genes and their association with heading date in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Heterotrimeric Heme Activator Protein (HAP) family genes are involved in the regulation of flowering in plants. It is not clear how many HAP genes regulate heading date in rice. In this study, we identified 35 HAP genes, including seven newly identified genes, and performed gene duplication and candidate gene-based association analyses. Analyses showed that segmental duplication and tandem duplication are the main mechanisms of HAP gene duplication. Expression profiling and functional identification indicated that duplication probably diversifies the functions of HAP genes. A nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that 13 HAP genes underwent selection. A candidate gene-based association analysis detected four HAP genes related to heading date. An investigation of transgenic plants or mutants of 23 HAP genes confirmed that overexpression of at least four genes delayed heading date under long-day conditions, including the previously cloned Ghd8/OsHAP3H. Our results indicate that the large number of HAP genes in rice was mainly produced by gene duplication, and a few HAP genes function to regulate heading date. Selection of HAP genes is probably caused by their diverse functions rather than regulation of heading.
27066017	Regulation of Galactolipid Biosynthesis by Overexpression of the Rice MGD Gene Contributes to Enhanced Aluminum Tolerance in Tobacco.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Membrane lipid alterations affect Al tolerance in plants, but little is known about the regulation of membrane lipid metabolism in response to Al stress. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) overexpressing rice monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) synthase (OsMGD) gene and wild-type tobacco plants were exposed to AlCl3, and the impact of Al toxicity on root growth, Al accumulation, plasma membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation and membrane lipid composition were investigated. Compared with the wild type, the transgenic plants exhibited rapid regrowth of roots after removal of Al and less damage to membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation under Al stress, meanwhile, the Al accumulation showed no difference between wild-type and transgenic plants. Lipid analysis showed that Al treatment dramatically decreased the content of MGDG and the ratio of MGDG to digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) in wild-type plants, while it was unchanged in transgenic plants. The stable of MGDG level and the ratio of MGDG/DGDG contribute to maintain the membrane stability and permeability. Moreover, Al caused a significant increase in phospholipids in wild-type plants, resulting in a high proportion of phospholipids and low proportion of galactolipids, but these proportions were unaffected in transgenic plants. The high proportion of phospholipids could contribute to a higher rate of Al(3+) binding in the membrane and thereby leads to more membrane perturbation and damage. These results show that the regulation of galactolipid biosynthesis could play an important role in maintaining membrane structure and function under Al stress.
26732528	Presence of unique glyoxalase III proteins in plants indicates the existence of shorter route for methylglyoxal detoxification.	2016	Sci Rep	Glyoxalase pathway, comprising glyoxalase I (GLY I) and glyoxalase II (GLY II) enzymes, is the major pathway for detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG) into D-lactate involving reduced glutathione (GSH). However, in bacteria, glyoxalase III (GLY III) with DJ-1/PfpI domain(s) can do the same conversion in a single step without GSH. Our investigations for the presence of DJ-1/PfpI domain containing proteins in plants have indicated the existence of GLY III-like proteins in monocots, dicots, lycopods, gymnosperm and bryophytes. A deeper in silico analysis of rice genome identified twelve DJ-1 proteins encoded by six genes. Detailed analysis has been carried out including their chromosomal distribution, genomic architecture and localization. Transcript profiling under multiple stress conditions indicated strong induction of OsDJ-1 in response to exogenous MG. A member of OsDJ-1 family, OsDJ-1C, showed high constitutive expression at all developmental stages and tissues of rice. MG depletion study complemented by simultaneous formation of D-lactate proved OsDJ-1C to be a GLY III enzyme that converts MG directly into D-lactate in a GSH-independent manner. Site directed mutagenesis of Cys-119 to Alanine significantly reduces its GLY III activity indicating towards the existence of functional GLY III enzyme in rice-a shorter route for MG detoxification.
26901100	Knock-down of a RING finger gene confers cold tolerance.	2016	Bioengineered	The plant-specific RING-domain finger proteins play important roles in plant development and stress responses. We recently identified and functionally characterized a stress-induced gene OsSRFP1 (Oryza sativa Stress-related RING Finger Protein 1) from rice. We showed evidences of the biotechnological potential of the suppression of OsSRFP1 expression in conferring cold tolerance. The increased cold tolerance of OsSRFP1 knock-down plants was associated with higher amounts of free proline and activities of antioxidant enzymes. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that OsSRFP1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Some predicted interacting partners of OsSRFP1 might be the substrates for OsSRFP1-mediated protein degradation. Interestingly, OsSRFP1 had trans-activation activity, suggesting the dual roles of OsSRFP1 in post-translational and transcriptional regulations in stress responses.
26795719	Overexpression of Rice Wall-Associated Kinase 25 (OsWAK25) Alters Resistance to Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens.	2016	PLoS One	Wall-associated kinases comprise a sub-family of receptor-like kinases that function in plant growth and stress responses. Previous studies have shown that the rice wall-associated kinase, OsWAK25, interacts with a diverse set of proteins associated with both biotic and abiotic stress responses. Here, we show that wounding and BTH treatments induce OsWAK25 transcript expression in rice. We generated OsWAK25 overexpression lines and show that these lines exhibit a lesion mimic phenotype and enhanced expression of rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1), OsPAL2, PBZ1 and PR10. Furthermore, these lines show resistance to the hemibiotrophic pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Magnaporthe oryzae, yet display increased susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens, Rhizoctonia solani and Cochliobolus miyabeanus.
27092147	The Involvement of OsPHO1;1 in the Regulation of Iron Transport Through Integration of Phosphate and Zinc Deficiency Signaling.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plants survival depends on their ability to cope with multiple nutrient stresses that often occur simultaneously, such as the limited availability of essential elements inorganic phosphate (Pi), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe). Previous research has provided information on the genes involved in efforts by plants to maintain homeostasis when a single nutrient (Pi, Zn, or Fe) is depleted. Recent findings on nutritional stress suggest that plant growth capacity is influenced by a complex tripartite interaction between Pi, Zn, and Fe homeostasis. However, despite its importance, how plants integrate multiple nutritional stimuli into complex developmental programs, and which genes are involved in this tripartite (Pi ZnFe) interaction is still not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the physiological and molecular responses of rice (Oriza sativa L.) to a combination of Pi, Zn, and/or Fe deficiency stress conditions. Results showed that Fe deficiency had the most drastic single-nutrient effect on biomass, while the Zn deficiency-effect depended on the presence of Pi in the medium. Interestingly, the observed negative effect of Fe starvation was alleviated by concomitant Pi or PiZn depletion. Members of the OsPHO1 family showed a differential transcriptional regulation in response PiZnFe combinatory stress conditions. Particularly, the transcripts of the OsPHO1;1 sense and its natural antisense cis-NatPHO1;1 showed the highest accumulation under PiZn deficiency. In this condition, the Ospho1;1 mutants showed over-accumulation of Fe in roots compared to wild type plants. These data reveal coordination between pathways involved in Fe transport and PiZn signaling in rice which involves the OsPHO1; 1, and support the hypothesis of a genetic basis for Pi, Zn, and Fe signaling interactions in plants.
26788958	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa arsenic-induced RING E3 ligase 1 (OsAIR1): Expression patterns, localization, functional interaction, and heterogeneous overexpression.	2016	J Plant Physiol	High levels of arsenic (As) in plants are a serious threat to human health, and arsenic accumulation affects plant metabolism and ultimately photosynthesis, growth, and development. We attempted to isolate As-responsive Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase genes from rice, and we have designated one such gene Oryza sativa arsenic-induced RING E3 ligase 1 (OsAIR1). OsAIR1 expression was induced under abiotic stress conditions, including drought, salt, heat, and As exposure. Results from an in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that OsAIR1 possesses E3 ligase activity. Within the cell, the expression of this gene was found to be localized to the vacuole. In a network-based analysis, we found significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) functions, which included ribonucleoprotein complexes such as ribosomes, suggesting that the function of OsAIR1 are related to translation. Differences in the proportion of seedlings with expanded cotyledons and root lengths, and the lack of differences in germination rates between OsAIR1-overexpressing lines and control plants under AsV stress, suggest that OsAIR1 may positively regulate post-germination plant growth under stress conditions.
26804776	Biochemical and molecular changes in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) to cope with chromium stress.	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Chromium (Cr) is very toxic to both humans and plants. This investigation aimed to understand the physiological and molecular responses of rice seedlings to Cr stress. Cr toxicity did not significantly affect morphological features and Cr accumulation in roots and shoots in Pokkali but not in BRRI 51, although there was a reduction in chlorophyll concentration in leaves of both genotypes. These results imply that Pokkali has mechanisms to cope with Cr supplementation. We therefore performed quantitative real-time PCR on the expression pattern of two chelator genes, OsPCS1 and OsMT1, but there were no significant changes in expression in roots and shoots of Pokkali and BRRI 51 following Cr stress. This suggests that there was no metal sequestration following heavy metal stress in roots of these genotypes. Moreover, no expression of two heavy metal transporter genes, OsHMA3 and OsNRAMP1, was induced after Cr stress in roots and shoots, suggesting that these transporter genes are not induced by Cr stress or might not be involved in Cr uptake in rice. We also performed a targeted study on the effect of Cr on Fe uptake mechanisms. Our studies showed a consistent reduction in Fe uptake, Fe reductase activity and expression of Fe-related genes (OsFRO1 and OsIRT1) under Cr stress in both roots and leaves of Pokkali. In contrast, these parameters and genes were significantly increased in Cr-sensitive BRRI 51 under Cr stress. The results confirm that limiting Fe uptake through the down-regulation of Fe reductase and Fe transporter genes is the main strategy of Cr-tolerant Pokkali to cope with Cr stress. Finally, increased CAT, POD and GR activity and elevated glutathione and proline synthesis might provide strong antioxidant defence against Cr stress in Pokkali. Taken together, our findings reveal that Cr stress tolerance in rice (Pokkali) is not related to metal sequestration but is associated with reduced Fe transport and increased antioxidant defence.
26754668	Analysis of the Rice ADP-Glucose Transporter (OsBT1) Indicates the Presence of Regulatory Processes in the Amyloplast Stroma That Control ADP-Glucose Flux into Starch.	2016	Plant Physiol	Previous studies showed that efforts to further elevate starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) seeds overproducing ADP-glucose (ADPglc) were prevented by processes downstream of ADPglc synthesis. Here, we identified the major ADPglc transporter by studying the shrunken3 locus of the EM1093 rice line, which harbors a mutation in the BRITTLE1 (BT1) adenylate transporter (OsBt1) gene. Despite containing elevated ADPglc levels (approximately 10-fold) compared with the wild-type, EM1093 grains are small and shriveled due to the reduction in the amounts and size of starch granules. Increases in ADPglc levels in EM1093 were due to their poor uptake of ADP-[(14)C]glc by amyloplasts. To assess the potential role of BT1 as a rate-determining step in starch biosynthesis, the maize ZmBt1 gene was overexpressed in the wild-type and the GlgC (CS8) transgenic line expressing a bacterial glgC-TM gene. ADPglc transport assays indicated that transgenic lines expressing ZmBT1 alone or combined with GlgC exhibited higher rates of transport (approximately 2-fold), with the GlgC (CS8) and GlgC/ZmBT1 (CS8/AT5) lines showing elevated ADPglc levels in amyloplasts. These increases, however, did not lead to further enhancement in seed weights even when these plant lines were grown under elevated CO2. Overall, our results indicate that rice lines with enhanced ADPglc synthesis and import into amyloplasts reveal additional barriers within the stroma that restrict maximum carbon flow into starch.
26767749	OsWOX3A is involved in negative feedback regulation of the gibberellic acid biosynthetic pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Exp Bot	The plant-specific WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) nuclear proteins have important roles in the transcriptional regulation of many developmental processes. Among the rice (Oryza sativa) WOX proteins, a loss of OsWOX3A function in narrow leaf2 (nal2) nal3 double mutants (termed nal2/3) causes pleiotropic effects, such as narrow and curly leaves, opened spikelets, narrow grains, more tillers, and fewer lateral roots, but almost normal plant height. To examine OsWOX3A function in more detail, transgenic rice overexpressing OsWOX3A (OsWOX3A-OX) were generated; unexpectedly, all of them consistently exhibited severe dwarfism with very short and wide leaves, a phenotype that resembles that of gibberellic acid (GA)-deficient or GA-insensitive mutants. Exogenous GA3 treatment fully rescued the developmental defects of OsWOX3A-OX plants, suggesting that constitutive overexpression of OsWOX3A downregulates GA biosynthesis. Quantitative analysis of GA intermediates revealed significantly reduced levels of GA20 and bioactive GA1 in OsWOX3A-OX, possibly due to downregulation of the expression of KAO, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, a GA biosynthetic enzyme. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that OsWOX3A directly interacts with the KAO promoter. OsWOX3A expression is drastically and temporarily upregulated by GA3 and downregulated by paclobutrazol, a blocker of GA biosynthesis. These data indicate that OsWOX3A is a GA-responsive gene and functions in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthetic pathway for GA homeostasis to maintain the threshold levels of endogenous GA intermediates throughout development.
26786707	OsHKT1;4-mediated Na(+) transport in stems contributes to Na(+) exclusion from leaf blades of rice at the reproductive growth stage upon salt stress.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Na(+) exclusion from leaf blades is one of the key mechanisms for glycophytes to cope with salinity stress. Certain class I transporters of the high-affinity K(+) transporter (HKT) family have been demonstrated to mediate leaf blade-Na(+) exclusion upon salinity stress via Na(+)-selective transport. Multiple HKT1 transporters are known to function in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the ion transport function of OsHKT1;4 and its contribution to the Na(+) exclusion mechanism in rice remain to be elucidated.

RESULTS: Here, we report results of the functional characterization of the OsHKT1;4 transporter in rice. OsHKT1;4 mediated robust Na(+) transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that OsHKT1;4 shows strong Na(+) selectivity among cations tested, including Li(+), Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), Cs(+), and NH4 (+), in oocytes. A chimeric protein, EGFP-OsHKT1;4, was found to be functional in oocytes and targeted to the plasma membrane of rice protoplasts. The level of OsHKT1;4 transcripts was prominent in leaf sheaths throughout the growth stages. Unexpectedly however, we demonstrate here accumulation of OsHKT1;4 transcripts in the stem including internode II and peduncle in the reproductive growth stage. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of OsHKT1;4 RNAi plants in the vegetative growth stage revealed no profound influence on the growth and ion accumulation in comparison with WT plants upon salinity stress. However, imposition of salinity stress on the RNAi plants in the reproductive growth stage caused significant Na(+) overaccumulation in aerial organs, in particular, leaf blades and sheaths. In addition, (22)Na(+) tracer experiments using peduncles of RNAi and WT plants suggested xylem Na(+) unloading by OsHKT1;4.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate a newly recognized function of OsHKT1;4 in Na(+) exclusion in stems together with leaf sheaths, thus excluding Na(+) from leaf blades of a japonica rice cultivar in the reproductive growth stage, but the contribution is low when the plants are in the vegetative growth stage.
26973678	MicroRNA390 Is Involved in Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential heavy metal that is toxic to plants. microRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-nucleotide RNAs that are ubiquitous regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Several plant miRNAs, such as miR390, have vital roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses including heavy metal stress. In this study, the expression of mature miR390 was significantly down-regulated under Cd stress in rice. Consequently, the target gene of miR390, OsSRK was dramatically induced by Cd treatment. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR390 displayed reduced Cd tolerance and higher Cd accumulation compared with wild-type plants. Simultaneously, expression of OsSRK was less pronounced in 35S:MIR390 plants than in wild-type. These results indicate that miR390 was a negative regulator involved in Cd stress tolerance in rice.
27096703	Proteomic and Physiological Studies Provide Insight into Photosynthetic Response of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Seedlings to Microgravity.	2016	Photochem Photobiol	The mechanisms whereby how photosynthesis is regulated and maintained under conditions of microgravity remain incompletely understood. Herein, we took a combination of proteomic and physiological approaches to examine the response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings to spaceflight conditions. Our results show that both PSI fluorescence emission peak and P700 absorbance amplitude are severely decreased in spaceflight seedlings under microgravity. This is consistent with an observed significant reduction in PSI efficiency (ϕI ). To further analyze global changes of protein profiles under microgravity, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantization (iTRAQ) labeling technology were deployed. Four hundred fifty-four differentially expressed proteins were identified by comparison of spaceflight and ground control. Of proteins relevant to photosynthesis, 34 were downregulated and 4 were upregulated. The significantly downregulated ones are essential components of PSI, NDH and the Cytb6 f complex. This downregulation of PSI proteins and/or protein structure changes may cause the overall reduction in PSI activity. Intriguingly, although abundance of some PSII proteins was altered under microgravity, no significant changes in PSII activity were detected. Taken together, our results suggest that PSI, rather than PSII being usually much more sensitive to environmental stresses, is more susceptible to spaceflight conditions in rice seedlings.
27053722	Nitrogen recycling from the xylem in rice leaves: dependence upon metabolism and associated changes in xylem hydraulics.	2016	J Exp Bot	Measurements of amino acids in the guttation fluid and in the xylem exudates of cut leaves from intact plants provide evidence of the remarkable efficiency with which these nitrogenous compounds are reabsorbed from the xylem sap. This could be achieved by mechanisms involving intercellular transport and/or metabolism. Developmental changes in transcripts and protein showed that transcripts for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) increased from the base to the leaf tip, and were markedly increased by supplying asparagine. Supplying amino acids also increased the amounts of protein of PEPCK and, to a lesser extent, of pyruvate, Pi dikinase. PEPCK is present in the hydathodes, stomata and vascular parenchyma of rice leaves. Evidence for the role of PEPCK was obtained by using 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of PEPCK, and by using an activation-tagged rice line that had an increase in PEPCK activity, to show that activation of PEPCK resulted in a decrease in N in the guttation fluid and that treatment by MPA resulted in an increase in amino acids in the guttation fluid and xylem sap towards the leaf tip. Furthermore, increasing PEPCK activity decreased the amount of guttation fluid, whereas decreasing PEPCK activity increased the amount of xylem sap or guttation fluid towards the leaf tip. The findings suggest the following hypotheses: (i) both metabolism and transport are involved in xylem recycling and (ii) excess N is the signal involved in modulating xylem hydraulics, perhaps via nutrient regulation of water-transporting aquaporins. Water relations and vascular metabolism and transport are thus intimately linked.
27043481	Crop responses to elevated CO2 and interactions with H2O, N, and temperature.	2016	Curr Opin Plant Biol	About twenty-seven years ago, free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology was developed that enabled the air above open-field plots to be enriched with CO2 for entire growing seasons. Since then, FACE experiments have been conducted on cotton, wheat, ryegrass, clover, potato, grape, rice, barley, sugar beet, soybean, cassava, rape, mustard, coffee (C3 crops), and sorghum and maize (C4 crops). Elevated CO2 (550ppm from an ambient concentration of about 353ppm in 1990) decreased evapotranspiration about 10% on average and increased canopy temperatures about 0.7°C. Biomass and yield were increased by FACE in all C3 species, but not in C4 species except when water was limiting. Yields of C3 grain crops were increased on average about 19%.
27076183	Functional classification of rice flanking sequence tagged genes using MapMan terms and global understanding on metabolic and regulatory pathways affected by dxr mutant having defects in light response.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most important food crops for humans. To improve the agronomical traits of rice, the functions of more than 1,000 rice genes have been recently characterized and summarized. The completed, map-based sequence of the rice genome has significantly accelerated the functional characterization of rice genes, but progress remains limited in assigning functions to all predicted non-transposable element (non-TE) genes, estimated to number 37,000-41,000.

RESULTS: The International Rice Functional Genomics Consortium (IRFGC) has generated a huge number of gene-indexed mutants by using mutagens such as T-DNA, Tos17 and Ds/dSpm. These mutants have been identified by 246,566 flanking sequence tags (FSTs) and cover 65 % (25,275 of 38,869) of the non-TE genes in rice, while the mutation ratio of TE genes is 25.7 %. In addition, almost 80 % of highly expressed non-TE genes have insertion mutations, indicating that highly expressed genes in rice chromosomes are more likely to have mutations by mutagens such as T-DNA, Ds, dSpm and Tos17. The functions of around 2.5 % of rice genes have been characterized, and studies have mainly focused on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Slow progress in characterizing the function of rice genes is mainly due to a lack of clues to guide functional studies or functional redundancy. These limitations can be partially solved by a well-categorized functional classification of FST genes. To create this classification, we used the diverse overviews installed in the MapMan toolkit. Gene Ontology (GO) assignment to FST genes supplemented the limitation of MapMan overviews.

CONCLUSION: The functions of 863 of 1,022 known genes can be evaluated by current FST lines, indicating that FST genes are useful resources for functional genomic studies. We assigned 16,169 out of 29,624 FST genes to 34 MapMan classes, including major three categories such as DNA, RNA and protein. To demonstrate the MapMan application on FST genes, transcriptome analysis was done from a rice mutant of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) gene with FST. Mapping of 756 down-regulated genes in dxr mutants and their annotation in terms of various MapMan overviews revealed candidate genes downstream of DXR-mediating light signaling pathway in diverse functional classes such as the methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphatepathway (MEP) pathway overview, photosynthesis, secondary metabolism and regulatory overview. This report provides a useful guide for systematic phenomics and further applications to enhance the key agronomic traits of rice.
27026054	Expansion Mechanisms and Evolutionary History on Genes Encoding DNA Glycosylases and Their Involvement in Stress and Hormone Signaling.	2016	Genome Biol Evol	DNA glycosylases catalyze the release of methylated bases. They play vital roles in the base excision repair pathway and might also function in DNA demethylation. At least three families of DNA glycosylases have been identified, which included 3'-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MDG) I, MDG II, and HhH-GPD (Helix-hairpin-Helix and Glycine/Proline/aspartate (D)). However, little is known on their genome-wide identification, expansion, and evolutionary history as well as their expression profiling and biological functions. In this study, we have genome-widely identified and evolutionarily characterized these family members. Generally, a genome encodes only one MDG II gene in most of organisms. No MDG I or MDG II gene was detected in green algae. However, HhH-GPD genes were detectable in all available organisms. The ancestor species contain small size of MDG I and HhH-GPD families. These two families were mainly expanded through the whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication. They were evolutionarily conserved and were generally under purifying selection. However, we have detected recent positive selection among the Oryza genus, which might play roles in species divergence. Further investigation showed that expression divergence played important roles in gene survival after expansion. All of these family genes were expressed in most of developmental stages and tissues in rice plants. High ratios of family genes were downregulated by drought and fungus pathogen as well as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) treatments, suggesting a negative regulation in response to drought stress and pathogen infection through ABA- and/or JA-dependent hormone signaling pathway.
25641865	Transgenic plants expressing the AaIT/GNA fusion protein show increased resistance and toxicity to both chewing and sucking pests.	2016	Insect Sci	The adoption of pest-resistant transgenic plants to reduce yield losses and decrease pesticide use has been successful. To achieve the goal of controlling both chewing and sucking pests in a given transgenic plant, we generated transgenic tobacco, Arabidopsis, and rice plants expressing the fusion protein, AaIT/GNA, in which an insecticidal scorpion venom neurotoxin (Androctonus australis toxin, AaIT) is fused to snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA). Compared with transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants expressing AaIT or GNA, transgenic plants expressing AaIT/GNA exhibited increased resistance and toxicity to one chewing pest, the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Transgenic tobacco and rice plants expressing AaIT/GNA showed increased resistance and toxicity to two sucking pests, the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, and the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, respectively. Moreover, in the field, transgenic rice plants expressing AaIT/GNA exhibited a significant improvement in grain yield when infested with N. lugens. This study shows that expressing the AaIT/GNA fusion protein in transgenic plants can be a useful approach for controlling pests, particularly sucking pests which are not susceptible to the toxin in Bt crops.
27111722	Rapid cloning of disease-resistance genes in plants using mutagenesis and sequence capture.	2016	Nat Biotechnol	Wild relatives of domesticated crop species harbor multiple, diverse, disease resistance (R) genes that could be used to engineer sustainable disease control. However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5-15 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (linkage drag). Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq)-that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr22 and Sr45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other commercially relevant crops and their relatives, including, for example, pea, bean, barley, oat, rye, rice and maize.
27110682	Disruption of OsSULTR3;3 reduces phytate and phosphorus concentrations and alters the metabolite profile in rice grains.	2016	New Phytol	Two low phytic acid (lpa) mutants have been developed previously with the aim to improve the nutritional value of rice (Oryza sativa) grains. In the present study, the impacts of lpa mutations on grain composition and underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Comparative compositional analyses and metabolite profiling demonstrated that concentrations of both phytic acid (PA) and total phosphorus (P) were significantly reduced in lpa brown rice, accompanied by changes in other metabolites and increased concentrations of nutritionally relevant compounds. The lpa mutations modified the expression of a number of genes involved in PA metabolism, as well as in sulfate and phosphate homeostasis and metabolism. Map-based cloning and complementation identified the underlying lpa gene to be OsSULTR3;3. The promoter of OsSULTR3;3 is highly active in the vascular bundles of leaves, stems and seeds, and its protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. No activity of OsSULTR3;3 was revealed for the transport of phosphate, sulfate, inositol or inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate by heterologous expression in either yeast or Xenopus oocytes. The findings reveal that OsSULTR3;3 plays an important role in grain metabolism, pointing to a new route to generate value-added grains in rice and other cereal crops.
27110776	The AaDREB1 Transcription Factor from the Cold-Tolerant Plant Adonis amurensis Enhances Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Plant.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in the regulation of plant resistance to environmental stresses and can specifically bind to dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat element (DRE/CRT) proteins (G/ACCGAC) and activate expression of many stress-inducible genes. Here, we cloned and characterized a novel gene (AaDREB1) encoding the DREB1 transcription factor from the cold-tolerant plant Adonis amurensis. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR results indicated that AaDREB1 expression was induced by salt, drought, cold stress, and abscisic acid application. A yeast one-hybrid assay demonstrated that AaDREB1 encodes a transcription activator and specifically binds to DRE/CRT. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis and rice harboring AaDREB1 showed enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and low temperature. These results indicated that AaDREB1 might be useful in genetic engineering to improve plant stress tolerance.
27122572	Silicon-induced reversibility of cadmium toxicity in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Silicon (Si) modulates tolerance to abiotic stresses, but little is known about the reversibility of stress effects by supplementing previously stressed plants with Si. This is surprising since recovery experiments might allow mechanisms of Si-mediated amelioration to be addressed. Rice was exposed to 10 µM CdCl2 for 4 d in hydroponics, followed by 0.6mM Si(OH)4 supplementation for 4 d. Si reversed the effects of Cd, as reflected in plant growth, photosynthesis, elemental composition, and some biochemical parameters. Cd-dependent deregulation of nutrient homeostasis was partially reversed by Si supply. Photosynthetic recovery within 48h following Si supply, coupled with strong stimulation of the ascorbate-glutathione system, indicates efficient activation of defense. The response was further verified by transcript analyses with emphasis on genes encoding members of the stress-associated protein (SAP) family. The transcriptional response to Cd was mostly reversed following Si supply. Reprogramming of the Cd response was obvious for Phytochelatin synthase 1, SAP1 , SAP14, and the transcription factor genes AP2/Erf020, Hsf31, and NAC6 whose transcript levels were strongly activated in roots of Cd-stressed rice, but down-regulated in the presence of Si. These findings, together with changes in biochemical parameters, highlight the significance of Si in growth recovery of Cd-stressed rice and indicate a decisive role for readjusting cell redox homeostasis.
27084974	Identification of phenolic compounds that suppress the virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae on rice via the type III secretion system.	2017	Mol Plant Pathol	The targeting of bacterial type III secretion systems (T3SSs), which are critical virulence factors in most Gram-negative pathogens, is regarded as an alternative strategy for the development of novel anti-microbial drugs. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) are two of the most important bacterial pathogens on rice, which cause leaf blight and leaf streak diseases, respectively. To identify potential anti-virulence drugs against these two pathogens, we screened a library of plant phenolic compounds and derivatives for their effects on the Xoo T3SS. Ten of 56 compounds significantly inhibited the promoter activity of a harpin gene, hpa1. These inhibitors were further tested for their impact on the hypersensitive response (HR) caused by Xoo on non-host tobacco plants. The results showed that pretreatment of Xoo with TS006 (o-coumaric acid, OCA), TS010, TS015 and TS018 resulted in significantly attenuated HR without affecting bacterial growth or survival. In addition, Cya translocation assays demonstrated that the translocation of two T3 effectors was suppressed by the four inhibitors. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that mRNA levels of representative genes in the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) cluster, as well as the regulatory genes hrpG and hrpX, were reduced by treatment with the four inhibitors, suggesting that expression of the Xoo T3SS was suppressed. The expression of other virulence factors was not suppressed, which indicated possible T3SS-specific inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated that these inhibitors reduced the disease symptoms of Xoo and Xoc on the rice cultivar (Oryza sativa) IR24 to varying extents.
27208287	Albino Leaf1 That Encodes the Sole Octotricopeptide Repeat Protein Is Responsible for Chloroplast Development.	2016	Plant Physiol	Chloroplast, the photosynthetic organelle in plants, plays a crucial role in plant development and growth through manipulating the capacity of photosynthesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development still remains elusive. Here, we characterized a mutant with defective chloroplasts in rice (Oryza sativa), termed albino leaf1 (al1), which exhibits a distinct albino phenotype in leaves, eventually leading to al1 seedling lethality. Electronic microscopy observation demonstrated that the number of thylakoids was reduced and the structure of thylakoids was disrupted in the al1 mutant during rice development, which eventually led to the breakdown of chloroplast. Molecular cloning revealed that AL1 encodes the sole octotricopeptide repeat protein (RAP) in rice. Genetic complementation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rap mutants indicated that the AL1 protein is a functional RAP. Further analysis illustrated that three transcript variants were present in the AL1 gene, and the altered splices occurred at the 3' untranslated region of the AL1 transcript. In addition, our results also indicate that disruption of the AL1 gene results in an altered expression of chloroplast-associated genes. Consistently, proteomic analysis demonstrated that the abundance of photosynthesis-associated proteins is altered significantly, as is that of a group of metabolism-associated proteins. More specifically, we found that the loss of AL1 resulted in altered abundances of ribosomal proteins, suggesting that RAP likely also regulates the homeostasis of ribosomal proteins in rice in addition to the ribosomal RNA. Taken together, we propose that AL1, particularly the AL1a and AL1c isoforms, plays an essential role in chloroplast development in rice.
27109389	The development of a phosphite-mediated fertilization and weed control system for rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Fertilizers and herbicides are two vital components of modern agriculture. The imminent danger of phosphate reserve depletion and multiple herbicide tolerance casts doubt on agricultural sustainability in the future. Phosphite, a reduced form of phosphorus, has been proposed as an alternative fertilizer and herbicide that would address the above problems to a considerable extent. To assess the suitability of a phosphite-based fertilization and weed control system for rice, we engineered rice plants with a codon-optimized ptxD gene from Pseudomonas stutzeri. Ectopic expression of this gene led to improved root growth, physiology and overall phenotype in addition to normal yield in transgenic plants in the presence of phosphite. Phosphite functioned as a translocative, non-selective, pre- and post-emergent herbicide. Phosphite use as a dual fertilizer and herbicide may mitigate the overuse of phosphorus fertilizers and reduce eutrophication and the development of herbicide resistance, which in turn will improve the sustainability of agriculture.
27094318	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the IQD gene family in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis).	2016	Sci Rep	Members of the plant-specific IQ67-domain (IQD) protein family are involved in various aspects of normal plant growth and developmental processes as well as basal defence response. Although hundreds of IQD proteins have been identified, only a small number of IQDs have been functionally characterized. Moreover, no systematic study has been performed on moso bamboo. In this study, we performed for the first time a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the IQD gene family in moso bamboo. We identified 29 non-redundant PeIQD encoding genes. Analysis of the evolutionary patterns and divergence revealed that the IQD genes underwent a large-scale event around 12 million years ago and the division times of IQD family genes between moso bamboo and rice, and, between moso bamboo and Brachypodium, were found to be 20-35 MYA and 25-40 MYA, respectively. We surveyed the putative promoter regions of the PeIQD genes, which showed that largely stress-related cis-elements existed in these genes. The expression profiles of the IQD genes shed light on their functional divergence. Additionally, a yeast two-hybrid assay proved that PeIQD8 can interact with PeCaM2 and that IQ or I in the IQ motif is required for PeIQD8 to combine with CaM2.
26991395	The broadly effective recessive resistance gene xa5 of rice is a virulence effector-dependent quantitative trait for bacterial blight.	2016	Plant J	Mutations in disease susceptibility (S) genes, here referred to as recessive resistance genes, have promise for providing broad durable resistance in crop species. However, few recessive disease resistance genes have been characterized. Here, we show that the broadly effective resistance gene xa5,for resistance to bacterial blight of rice (Oryza sativa), is dependent on the effector genes present in the pathogen. Specifically, the effectiveness of xa5 in preventing disease by strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is dependent on major transcription activation-like (TAL) effector genes, and correlates with reduced expression of the cognate S genes. xa5 is ineffective in preventing disease by strains containing the TAL effector gene pthXo1, which directs robust expression of the S gene OsSWEET11, a member of sucrose transporter gene family. Incompatibility is associated with major TAL effectors that target the known alternative S genes OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET13. Incompatibility is defeated by transfer of pthXo1 to otherwise xa5-incompatible strains or by engineering a synthetic designer TAL effector to boost SWEET gene expression. In either case, compatible or incompatible, target gene expression and lesion formation are reduced in the presence of xa5. The results indicate that xa5 functions as a quantitative trait locus, dampening effector function, and, regardless of compatibility, target gene expression. Resistance is hypothesized to occur when S gene expression, and, by inference, sucrose leakage, falls below a threshold level.
27039184	OsPhyA modulates rice flowering time mainly through OsGI under short days and Ghd7 under long days in the absence of phytochrome B.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Phytochromes recognize light signals and control diverse developmental processes. In rice, all three phytochrome genes-OsphyA, OsphyB, and OsphyC-are involved in regulating flowering time. We investigated the role of OsPhyA by comparing the osphyA osphyB double mutant to an osphyB single mutant. Plants of the double mutant flowered later than the single under short days (SD) but bolted earlier under long days (LD). Under SD, this delayed-flowering phenotype was primarily due to the decreased expression of Oryza sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI), which controls three flowering activators: Heading date 1 (Hd1), OsMADS51, and Oryza sativa Indeterminate 1 (OsId1). Under LD, although the expression of several repressors, e.g., Hd1, Oryza sativa CONSTANS-like 4 (OsCOL4), and AP2 genes, was affected in the double mutant, that of Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) was the most significantly reduced. These results indicated that OsPhyA influences flowering time mainly by affecting the expression of OsGI under SD and Ghd7 under LD when phytochrome B is absent. We also demonstrated that far-red light delays flowering time via both OsPhyA and OsPhyB.
27077850	Comparative Small RNA Analysis of Pollen Development in Autotetraploid and Diploid Rice.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in plant reproduction. However, knowledge on microRNAome analysis in autotetraploid rice is rather limited. Here, high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze miRNAomes during pollen development in diploid and polyploid rice. A total of 172 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEM) were detected in autotetraploid rice compared to its diploid counterpart, and 57 miRNAs were specifically expressed in autotetraploid rice. Of the 172 DEM, 115 and 61 miRNAs exhibited up- and down-regulation, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis on the targets of up-regulated DEM showed that they were enriched in transport and membrane in pre-meiotic interphase, reproduction in meiosis, and nucleotide binding in single microspore stage. osa-miR5788 and osa-miR1432-5p_R+1 were up-regulated in meiosis and their targets revealed interaction with the meiosis-related genes, suggesting that they may involve in the genes regulation associated with the chromosome behavior. Abundant 24 nt siRNAs associated with transposable elements were found in autotetraploid rice during pollen development; however, they significantly declined in diploid rice, suggesting that 24 nt siRNAs may play a role in pollen development. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the effect of polyploidy on small RNA expression patterns during pollen development that cause pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice.
27106031	Wax crystal-sparse leaf 3 encoding a β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: WSL3 encodes β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR) in rice, in a similar way to YBR159w in yeast, and is essential for VLCFA biosynthesis and leaf wax accumulation. Cuticular waxes on plant surfaces limit non-stomatal water loss, protect plants against deposits of dust and impose a physical barrier to pathogen infection. We identified a wax-deficient mutant of rice, wax crystal-sparse leaf 3 (wsl3), which exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype that includes reduced epicuticular wax crystals on the leaf surface and altered wax composition. Map-based cloning demonstrated that defects in the mutant were caused by two adjacent single-nucleotide changes in a gene encoding β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR) that catalyzes the second step of the fatty acid elongation reaction. The identity of WSL3 was further confirmed by genetic complementation. Transient assays of fluorescent protein-tagged WSL3 in tobacco protoplasts showed that WSL3 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the compartment of fatty acid elongation in cells. Quantitative PCR and histochemical staining indicated that WSL3 is universally expressed in tissues. RNA interference of WSL3 caused a phenotype that mimicked the wsl3 mutant. Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) 20:0 and 22:0, or 20:1Δ(11) and 22:1Δ(13), were detected when WSL3 and Arabidopsis fatty acid elongation 1 (FAE1) were co-expressed in a yeast ybr159wΔ mutant strain. Our results indicated that WSL3 affects rice cuticular wax production by participating in VLCFA elongation.
27061745	A fungal endophyte helps plants to tolerate root herbivory through changes in gibberellin and jasmonate signaling.	2016	New Phytol	Plant-microbe mutualisms can improve plant defense, but the impact of root endophytes on below-ground herbivore interactions remains unknown. We investigated the effects of the root endophyte Piriformospora indica on interactions between rice (Oryza sativa) plants and its root herbivore rice water weevil (RWW; Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus), and how plant jasmonic acid (JA) and GA regulate this tripartite interaction. Glasshouse experiments with wild-type rice and coi1-18 and Eui1-OX mutants combined with nutrient, jasmonate and gene expression analyses were used to test: whether RWW adult herbivory above ground influences subsequent damage caused by larval herbivory below ground; whether P. indica protects plants against RWW; and whether GA and JA signaling mediate these interactions. The endophyte induced plant tolerance to root herbivory. RWW adults and larvae acted synergistically via JA signaling to reduce root growth, while endophyte-elicited GA biosynthesis suppressed the herbivore-induced JA in roots and recovered plant growth. Our study shows for the first time the impact of a root endophyte on plant defense against below-ground herbivores, adds to growing evidence that induced tolerance may be an important root defense, and implicates GA as a signal component of inducible plant tolerance against biotic stress.
26956504	Flower development: the evolutionary history and functions of the AGL6 subfamily MADS-box genes.	2016	J Exp Bot	AGL6 is an ancient subfamily of MADS-box genes found in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Its functions remained elusive despite the fact that the MADS-box genes and the ABC model have been studied for >20 years. Nevertheless, recent discoveries in petunia, rice, and maize support its involvement in the 'E' function of floral development, very similar to the closely related AGL2 (SEPALLATA) subfamily which has been well characterized. The known functions of AGL6 span from ancient conserved roles to new functions acquired in specific plant families. The AGL6 genes are involved in floral meristem regulation, in floral organs, and ovule (integument) and seed development, and have possible roles in both male and female germline and gametophyte development. In grasses, they are also important for the development of the first whorl of the flower, whereas in Arabidopsis they may play additional roles before floral meristem formation. This review covers these recent insights and some other aspects that are not yet fully elucidated, which deserve more studies in the future.
27126603	Probing molecular events associated with early development of thylakoid membranes by comparative proteomics and low temperature fluorescence.	2016	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: A comparison of protein profiles between prolamellar bodies from dark-grown etioplasts and thylakoid membranes from de-etioplasts illuminated respectively for 1, 5 and 9h revealed 155 differentially expressed CBB-stained spots. Clear results showed that the nonphototransformable Pchlide627-632 was the dominant pigment form in the PLBs of rice etioplasts during plant development in dark and transformed slowly to chlorophyllide in rice etioplasts when exposed to light. The light-induced accumulation of ACC oxidase, which catalyzes the final step of ethylene synthesis using ACC as substrate, would facilitate chlorophyll synthesis by inducing PORa/b expression via ethylene signaling. It could be also suggested that cyclic electron transport might play an important role in generation of ATP for carbon fixation and photoprotection of photosystems from excessive light in prothylakoid. Furthermore, the overproduction of ClpC1, which targets proteins to the ClpPR core complex for degradation, was observed only in Stage 1, during which period PLBs disrupted and converted into prothylakoids, suggesting that ClpC1 was of particular importance for disassembly of PLBs of etioplasts when exposed to light. This study revealed the possible biochemical and physiological processes lead to the formation of functional thylakoid membranes.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we monitored the light-induced transformation of prolamellar bodies into thylakoid membranes, which is correlated to the biogenesis of photosynthetic apparatus involving a complex cascade of biochemical and structural events. Three stages of thylakoid development classified according to the thylakoid development status (Adam et al., 2011) were studied for biogenesis of photosynthetic apparatus: Stage 1, prothylakoids emerge from the disrupted PLBs; Stage 2, prothylakoids converted into primary thylakoids which were dispersed in the stroma; Stage 3, the continuous grana and stroma thylakoids are formed. The development stage-dependent changes in the proteomic profile of the thylakoids were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). This information was complemented with the steady-state 77K chlorophyll fluorescence of thylakoids at the corresponding development stage. Together, these analyses allowed us to further understand the molecular processes connected to the formation of functional thylakoid membranes.
27118394	Genome-wide analysis of Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) to investigate lost/acquired genes during rice domestication.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) was domesticated from common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.). Compared to other studies which concentrate on rice origin, this study is to genetically elucidate the substantially phenotypic and physiological changes from wild rice to cultivated rice at the whole genome level.

RESULTS: Instead of comparing two assembled genomes, this study directly compared the Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR) Illumina sequencing reads with the Nipponbare (O. sativa) complete genome without assembly of the DXWR genome. Based on the results from the comparative genomics analysis, structural variations (SVs) between DXWR and Nipponbare were determined to locate deleted genes which could have been acquired by Nipponbare during rice domestication. To overcome the limit of the SV detection, the DXWR transcriptome was also sequenced and compared with the Nipponbare transcriptome to discover the genes which could have been lost in DXWR during domestication. Both 1591 Nipponbare-acquired genes and 206 DXWR-lost transcripts were further analyzed using annotations from multiple sources. The NGS data are available in the NCBI SRA database with ID SRP070627.

CONCLUSIONS: These results help better understanding the domestication from wild rice to cultivated rice at the whole genome level and provide a genomic data resource for rice genetic research or breeding. One finding confirmed transposable elements contribute greatly to the genome evolution from wild rice to cultivated rice. Another finding suggested the photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation system in cultivated rice could have adapted to environmental changes simultaneously during domestication.
26882848	The Genetic Structure, Virulence, and Fungicide Sensitivity of Fusarium fujikuroi in Taiwan.	2016	Phytopathology	The rice disease bakanae, caused by Fusarium fujikuroi Nirenberg, has been present in Taiwan for over a century. To better understand the genetic diversity and structure of F. fujikuroi, a set of 16 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were newly developed and used to analyze 637 F. fujikuroi isolates collected in 14 cities or counties around Taiwan from 1996 to 2013. On the basis of Bayesian clustering, the isolates were classified into four highly differentiated clusters: cluster B likely derived from the more widespread and genetically diversified clusters A or C, and cluster D was restricted to four cities or counties and may have been introduced from unknown sources genetically distinct from clusters A, B, and C. The coexistence of both mating types (MAT1-1:MAT1-2 = 1:1.88) and the highly diversified vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) (16 VCG among the 21 assessed isolates) suggest the likelihood of sexual reproduction in the field. However, the biased mating type ratios and linkage disequilibrium in the population suggest nonrandom mating between individuals. A significant pattern of isolation by distance was also detected, which implies a geographical restricted gene flow and low dissemination ability of F. fujikuroi. Evaluation of 24 representative isolates on eight rice varieties revealed differential levels of virulence, however no clear pattern of specific variety x isolate interaction was observed. Investigations of the differences in virulence and fungicide sensitivity between 8 early isolates (1998 and 2002) and 52 recent isolates (2012) indicate the evolution of increased resistance to the fungicide prochloraz in F. fujikuroi in Taiwan.
27172200	Sdt97: A Point Mutation in the 5' Untranslated Region Confers Semidwarfism in Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Semidwarfism is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding programs. The semidwarf mutant gene Sdt97 was previously described. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the mutant is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we identified the mutant gene by a map-based cloning method. Using a residual heterozygous line (RHL) population, Sdt97 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 in the interval of nearly 60 kb between STS marker N6 and SNP marker N16 within the PAC clone P0453H04. Sequencing of the candidate genes in the target region revealed that a base transversion from G to C occurred in the 5' untranslated region of Sdt97 qRT-PCR results confirmed that the transversion induced an obvious change in the expression pattern of Sdt97 at different growth and developmental stages. Plants transgenic for Sdt97 resulted in the restoration of semidwarfism of the mutant phenotype, or displayed a greater dwarf phenotype than the mutant. Our results indicate that a point mutation in the 5' untranslated region of Sdt97 confers semidwarfism in rice. Functional analysis of Sdt97 will open a new field of study for rice semidwarfism, and also expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of semidwarfism in rice.
27111837	Hd3a, RFT1 and Ehd1 integrate photoperiodic and drought stress signals to delay the floral transition in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Plants show a high degree of developmental plasticity in response to external cues, including day length and environmental stress. Water scarcity in particular can interfere with photoperiodic flowering, resulting in the acceleration of the switch to reproductive growth in several species, a process called drought escape. However, other strategies are possible and drought stress can also delay flowering, albeit the underlying mechanisms have never been addressed at the molecular level. We investigated these interactions in rice, a short day species in which drought stress delays flowering. A protocol that allows the synchronization of drought with the floral transition was set up to profile the transcriptome of leaves subjected to stress under distinct photoperiods. We identified clusters of genes that responded to drought differently depending on day length. Exposure to drought stress under floral-inductive photoperiods strongly reduced transcription of EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), primary integrators of day length signals, providing a molecular connection between stress and the photoperiodic pathway. However, phenotypic and transcriptional analyses suggested that OsGIGANTEA (OsGI) does not integrate drought and photoperiodic signals as in Arabidopsis, highlighting molecular differences between long and short day model species.
27040682	The ethylene response factor OsERF109 negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice.	2017	Protoplasma	Drought is an important factor limiting plant development and crop production. Dissecting the factors involved in this process is the key for enhancement of plant tolerance to drought stress by genetic approach. Here, we evaluated the regulatory function of a novel rice ethylene response factor (ERF) OsERF109 in drought stress. Expression of OsERF109 was rapidly induced by stress and phytohormones. Subcellular localization and transactivation assay demonstrated that OsERF109 was localized in nucleus and possessed transactivation activity. Transgenic plants overexpressing (OE) and knockdown with RNA interfering (RI) OsERF109 exhibited significantly reduced and improved drought resistance, respectively, indicating that OsERF109 negatively regulates drought resistance in rice. Furthermore, measurement by gas chromatography showed that ethylene contents were less in OE while more in RI lines than these in wild types, supporting the data of drought tolerance and water loss in transgenic lines. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis also proved the regulation of OsERF109 in the expression of OSACS6, OSACO2, and OsERF3, which have been identified to play important roles in ethylene biosynthesis. Based on these results, our data evidence that OsERF109 regulates drought resistance by affecting the ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Overall, our study reveals the negative role of OsERF109 in ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance in rice.
27050503	Production and characterization of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase in transgenic rice cell suspension culture.	2016	J Biotechnol	Pompe disease is a fatal genetic muscle disorder caused by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), a glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme. In this study, the human GAA cDNA gene was synthesized from human placenta cells and cloned into a plant expression vector under the control of the rice α-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter. The plant expression vector was introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Genomic DNA PCR and Northern blot analysis were used to determine the integration and mRNA expression of the hGAA gene in the putative transgenic rice cells. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed that the glycosylated precursor recombinant hGAA had a molecular mass of 110kDa due to the presence of seven N-glycosylation sites. The accumulation of hGAA protein in the culture medium was approximately 37mg/L after 11 days of culturing in a sugar depletion medium. The His tagged-hGAA protein was purified using an Ni-NTA column and confirmed as the precursor form of hGAA without the signal peptide encoded by the cDNA on the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The acid alpha-glucosidase activity of hGAA produced in transgenic rice cells gave results similar to those of the enzyme produced by CHO cells.
27048369	Oryza sativa H+-ATPase (OSA) is Involved in the Regulation of Dumbbell-Shaped Guard Cells of Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The stomatal apparatus consists of a pair of guard cells and regulates gas exchange between the leaf and atmosphere. In guard cells, blue light (BL) activates H(+)-ATPase in the plasma membrane through the phosphorylation of its penultimate threonine, mediating stomatal opening. Although this regulation is thought to be widely adopted among kidney-shaped guard cells in dicots, the molecular basis underlying that of dumbbell-shaped guard cells in monocots remains unclear. Here, we show that H(+)-ATPases are involved in the regulation of dumbbell-shaped guard cells. Stomatal opening of rice was promoted by the H(+)-ATPase activator fusicoccin and by BL, and the latter was suppressed by the H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate. Using H(+)-ATPase antibodies, we showed the presence of phosphoregulation of the penultimate threonine in Oryza sativa H(+)-ATPases (OSAs) and localization of OSAs in the plasma membrane of guard cells. Interestingly, we identified one H(+)-ATPase isoform, OSA7, that is preferentially expressed among the OSA genes in guard cells, and found that loss of function of OSA7 resulted in partial insensitivity to BL. We conclude that H(+)-ATPase is involved in BL-induced stomatal opening of dumbbell-shaped guard cells in monocotyledon species.
26979939	Altered expression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement or suppression of shoot gravitropism.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme, exists widely in plants, although its role in plant signal transduction is still unclear. We have hypothesized that the plant AChE regulates asymmetric distribution of hormones and substrates due to gravity stimulus, based on indirect pharmacological experiments using an AChE inhibitor. As a direct evidence for this hypothesis, our recent study has shown that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response in rice seedlings and suggested that the function of the rice AChE relates to the promotion of shoot gravitropism in the seedlings. Here, we report that AChE suppression inhibited shoot gravitropism in rice seedlings, as supportive evidence demonstrating the role of AChE as a positive regulator of shoot gravitropic response in plants.
27040147	Identification of reference genes for quantitative expression analysis using large-scale RNA-seq data of Arabidopsis thaliana and model crop plants.	2016	Genes Genet Syst	In quantitative gene expression analysis, normalization using a reference gene as an internal control is frequently performed for appropriate interpretation of the results. Efforts have been devoted to exploring superior novel reference genes using microarray transcriptomic data and to evaluating commonly used reference genes by targeting analysis. However, because the number of specifically detectable genes is totally dependent on probe design in the microarray analysis, exploration using microarray data may miss some of the best choices for the reference genes. Recently emerging RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an ideal resource for comprehensive exploration of reference genes since this method is capable of detecting all expressed genes, in principle including even unknown genes. We report the results of a comprehensive exploration of reference genes using public RNA-seq data from plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Glycine max (soybean), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Oryza sativa (rice). To select reference genes suitable for the broadest experimental conditions possible, candidates were surveyed by the following four steps: (1) evaluation of the basal expression level of each gene in each experiment; (2) evaluation of the expression stability of each gene in each experiment; (3) evaluation of the expression stability of each gene across the experiments; and (4) selection of top-ranked genes, after ranking according to the number of experiments in which the gene was expressed stably. Employing this procedure, 13, 10, 12 and 21 top candidates for reference genes were proposed in Arabidopsis, soybean, tomato and rice, respectively. Microarray expression data confirmed that the expression of the proposed reference genes under broad experimental conditions was more stable than that of commonly used reference genes. These novel reference genes will be useful for analyzing gene expression profiles across experiments carried out under various experimental conditions.
27108120	Rice and chickpea GDPDs are preferentially influenced by low phosphate and CaGDPD1 encodes an active glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Rice and chickpea GDPD s are transcriptionally influenced by mineral deficiencies; especially, by phosphate starvation and CaGDP1 encodes an active glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDPDs) are enzymes involved in the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters into sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and corresponding alcohols. These phospholipid remodeling genes have been suggested to play important roles in phosphate homeostasis. However, comprehensive information about the role of GDPDs under low phosphate (P) and other nutrient deficiencies (N, K, Fe, Zn) in rice and chickpea is missing. Here, we identified 13 OsGDPDs and 6 CaGDPDs in rice and chickpea, respectively, and partly characterized their roles in multiple nutrient stresses. Expression profiling after 7 and 15 days of deficiency treatments revealed unique and overlapping differential expression patterns of OsGDPDs and CaGDPDs under different nutrient stresses. Principal component analysis on the expression patterns of OsGDPDs and CaGDPDs revealed their preferential role in P starvation. Some of the GDPDs were also induced by N, K, Fe and Zn deficiency in temporal manner in both crops suggesting their roles in multiple nutrient stresses. Biochemical characterization of highly responsive chickpea GDPD, CaGDPD1, confirmed its in vitro GDPD activity and revealed its optimal temperature, pH and cofactor requirements. Further, CaGDPD1 showed its accumulation in ER and endomembranes. We hereby propose CaGDPD1 and various OsGDPDs as low P responsive marker genes in chickpea and rice, respectively. Our data uphold role of GDPDs in multinutrient responses and suggest them as candidates for rice and chickpea improvement for tolerance to various nutrient deficiencies.
27055266	Finding the genes to build C4 rice.	2016	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Rice, a C3 crop, is a staple food for more than half of the world's population, with most consumers living in developing countries. Engineering C4 photosynthetic traits into rice is increasingly suggested as a way to meet the 50% yield increase that is predicted to be needed by 2050. Advances in genome-wide deep-sequencing, gene discovery and genome editing platforms have brought the possibility of engineering a C3 to C4 conversion closer than ever before. Because C4 plants have evolved independently multiple times from C3 origins, it is probably that key genes and gene regulatory networks that regulate C4 were recruited from C3 ancestors. In the past five years there have been over 20 comparative transcriptomic studies published that aimed to identify these recruited C4 genes and regulatory mechanisms. Here we present an overview of what we have learned so far and preview the efforts still needed to provide a practical blueprint for building C4 rice.
27102613	Ribosomal protein S6 kinase1 coordinates with TOR-Raptor2 to regulate thylakoid membrane biosynthesis in rice.	2016	Biochim Biophys Acta	Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) functions as a key component in the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway involved in multiple processes in eukaryotes. The role and regulation of TOR-S6K in lipid metabolism remained unknown in plants. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that TOR-Raptor2-S6K1 is important for thylakoid galactolipid biosynthesis and thylakoid grana modeling in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genetic suppression of S6K1 caused pale yellow-green leaves, defective thylakoid grana architecture. S6K1 directly interacts with Raptor2, a core component in TOR signaling, and S6K1 activity is regulated by Raptor2 and TOR. Plants with suppressed Raptor2 expression or reduced TOR activity by inhibitors mimicked the S6K1-deficient phenotype. A significant reduction in galactolipid content was found in the s6k1, raptor2 mutant or TOR-inhibited plants, which was accompanied by decreased transcript levels of the set of genes such as lipid phosphate phosphatase α5 (LPPα5), MGDG synthase 1 (MGD1), and DGDG synthase 1 (DGD1) involved in galactolipid synthesis, compared to the control plants. Moreover, loss of LPPα5 exhibited a similar phenotype with pale yellow-green leaves. These results suggest that TOR-Raptor2-S6K1 is important for modulating thylakoid membrane lipid biosynthesis, homeostasis, thus enhancing thylakoid grana architecture and normal photosynthesis ability in rice.
27111707	Analysis of cis-acting regulatory elements of Respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) gene families in Arabidopsis and rice provides clues for their diverse functions.	2016	Comput Biol Chem	NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a critical enzyme in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It catalyzes the production of apoplastic superoxide (O2(-)), that regulates a wide array of biological functions in different organisms. Plant Noxes are homologs of catalytic subunit of mammalian NADPH oxidase and are well-known as Respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rbohs). In recent years, there has been growing interest to study plant Noxes due to their versatile roles in plant systems. In the present work, comprehensive analysis on upstream regions from 10 Rbohs from Arabidopsis thaliana and 9 from Oryza sativa japonica was conducted. The distribution of various cis-elements, CpG islands and tandem repeats were analyzed to uncover the 5' regulatory region in wide array of functions from Rbohs. Information retrieved from cis-elements analysis was also correlated with the microarray data. Present study which involves uncovering transcription regulatory elements provided vital clues for diverse functions of plant Rbohs.
27031005	OsWRKY53, a versatile switch in regulating herbivore-induced defense responses in rice.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	WRKY proteins, which belong to a large family of plant-specific transcription factors, play important roles in plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores by regulating defense-related signaling pathways. Recently, a rice WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY53 has been reported to function as a negative feedback modulator of OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and thereby to control the size of the investment a rice plant makes to defend against a chewing herbivore, the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis. We investigated the performance of a piecing-sucking herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, on transgenic plants that silence or overexpress OsWRKY53, and found that OsWRKY53 activates rice defenses against BPH by activating an H2O2 burst and suppressing ethylene biosynthesis. These findings suggest that OsWRKY53 functions not only as a regulator of plants' investment in specific defenses, but also as a switch to initiate new defenses against other stresses, highlighting the versatility and importance of OsWRKY53 in herbivore-induced plant defenses.
27105887	Stereospecificity in strigolactone biosynthesis and perception.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Plants produce strigolactones with different structures and different stereospecificities which provides the potential for diversity and flexibility of function. Strigolactones (SLs) typically comprise a tricyclic ABC ring system linked through an enol-ether bridge to a butenolide D-ring. The stereochemistry of the butenolide ring is conserved but two alternative configurations of the B-C ring junction leads to two families of SLs, exemplified by strigol and orobanchol. Further modifications lead to production of many different strigolactones within each family. The D-ring structure is established by a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase producing a single stereoisomer of carlactone, the likely precursor of all SLs. Subsequent oxidation involves cytochrome P450 enzymes of the MAX1 family. In rice, MAX1 enzymes act stereospecifically to produce 4-deoxyorobanchol and orobanchol. Strigol- and orobanchol-type SLs have different activities in the control of seed germination and shoot branching, depending on plant species. This can partly be explained by different stereospecificity of SL receptors which includes the KAI2/HTL protein family in parasitic plants and the D14 protein functioning in shoot development. Many studies use chemically synthesised SL analogues such as GR24 which is prepared as a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, one with the same stereo-configuration as strigol, and the other its enantiomer, which does not correspond to any known SL. In Arabidopsis, these two stereoisomers are preferentially perceived by AtD14 and KAI2, respectively, which activate different developmental pathways. Thus caution should be exercised in the use of SL racemic mixtures, while conversely the use of specific stereoisomers can provide powerful tools and yield critical information about receptors and signalling pathways in operation.
27090184	Effects of CaMSRB2-Expressing Transgenic Rice Cultivation on Soil Microbial Communities.	2016	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Although many studies on the effects of genetically modified (GM) crops on soil microorganisms have been carried out over the past decades, they have provided contradictory information, even for the same GM crop, owing to the diversity of the soil environments in which they were conducted. This inconsistency in results suggests that the effects of GM crops on soil microorganisms should be considered from many aspects. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GM drought-tolerant rice MSRB2-Bar-8, which expresses the CaMSRB2 gene, on soil microorganisms based on the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. To this end, rhizosphere soils of GM and non-GM (IM) rice were analyzed for soil chemistry, population densities of soil microorganisms, and microbial community structure (using pyrosequencing technology) at three growth stages (seedling, tillering, and maturity). There was no significant difference in the soil chemistry between GM and non-GM rice. The microbial densities of the GM soils were found to be within the range of those of the non-GM rice. In the pyrosequencing analyses, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant at the seedling stage, while Chloroflexi showed dominance over Proteobacteria at the maturity stage in both the GM and non-GM soils. An UPGMA dendrogram showed that the soil microbial communities were clustered by growth stage. Taken together, the results from this study suggest that the effects of MSRB2-Bar-8 cultivation on soil microorganisms are not significant.
26818077	Increasing Genome Sampling and Improving SNP Genotyping for Genotyping-by-Sequencing with New Combinations of Restriction Enzymes.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has emerged as a useful genomic approach for exploring genome-wide genetic variation. However, GBS commonly samples a genome unevenly and can generate a substantial amount of missing data. These technical features would limit the power of various GBS-based genetic and genomic analyses. Here we present software called IgCoverage for in silico evaluation of genomic coverage through GBS with an individual or pair of restriction enzymes on one sequenced genome, and report a new set of 21 restriction enzyme combinations that can be applied to enhance GBS applications. These enzyme combinations were developed through an application of IgCoverage on 22 plant, animal, and fungus species with sequenced genomes, and some of them were empirically evaluated with different runs of Illumina MiSeq sequencing in 12 plant species. The in silico analysis of 22 organisms revealed up to eight times more genome coverage for the new combinations consisted of pairing four- or five-cutter restriction enzymes than the commonly used enzyme combination PstI + MspI. The empirical evaluation of the new enzyme combination (HinfI + HpyCH4IV) in 12 plant species showed 1.7-6 times more genome coverage than PstI + MspI, and 2.3 times more genome coverage in dicots than monocots. Also, the SNP genotyping in 12 Arabidopsis and 12 rice plants revealed that HinfI + HpyCH4IV generated 7 and 1.3 times more SNPs (with 0-16.7% missing observations) than PstI + MspI, respectively. These findings demonstrate that these novel enzyme combinations can be utilized to increase genome sampling and improve SNP genotyping in various GBS applications.
27208223	Differential Effects of Nitrogen Forms on Cell Wall Phosphorus Remobilization Are Mediated by Nitric Oxide, Pectin Content, and Phosphate Transporter Expression.	2016	Plant Physiol	NH4 (+) is a major source of inorganic nitrogen for rice (Oryza sativa), and NH4 (+) is known to stimulate the uptake of phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear whether NH4 (+) can also stimulate P remobilization when rice is grown under P-deficient conditions. In this study, we use the two rice cultivars 'Nipponbare' and 'Kasalath' that differ in their cell wall P reutilization, to demonstrate that NH4 (+) positively regulates the pectin content and activity of pectin methylesterase in root cell walls under -P conditions, thereby remobilizing more P from the cell wall and increasing soluble P in roots and shoots. Interestingly, our results show that more NO (nitric oxide) was produced in the rice root when NH4 (+) was applied as the sole nitrogen source compared with the NO3 (-) The effect of NO on the reutilization of P from the cell walls was further demonstrated through the application of the NO donor SNP (sodium nitroprusside) and c-PTIO (NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide). What's more, the P-transporter gene OsPT2 is up-regulated under NH4 (+) supplementation and is therefore involved in the stimulated P remobilization. In conclusion, our data provide novel (to our knowledge) insight into the regulatory mechanism by which NH4 (+) stimulates Pi reutilization in cell walls of rice.
27063367	Exploring novel genetic sources of salinity tolerance in rice through molecular and physiological characterization.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Agricultural productivity is increasingly being affected by the build-up of salinity in soils and water worldwide. The genetic base of salt-tolerant rice donors being used in breeding is relatively narrow and needs broadening to breed varieties with wider adaptation to salt-affected areas. This study evaluated a large set of rice accessions of diverse origins to identify and characterize novel sources of salt tolerance.

METHODS: Diversity analysis was performed on 107 germplasm accessions using a genome-wide set of 376 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, along with characterization of allelic diversity at the major quantitative trait locus Saltol Sixty-nine accessions were further evaluated for physiological traits likely associated with responses to salt stress during the seedling stage.

KEY RESULTS: Three major clusters corresponding to the indica, aus and aromatic subgroups were identified. The largest group was indica, with the salt-tolerant Pokkali accessions in one sub-cluster, while a set of Bangladeshi landraces, including Akundi, Ashfal, Capsule, Chikirampatnai and Kutipatnai, were in a different sub-cluster. A distinct aus group close to indica contained the salt-tolerant landrace Kalarata, while a separate aromatic group closer to japonica rice contained a number of traditional, but salt-sensitive Bangladeshi landraces. These accessions have different alleles at the Saltol locus. Seven landraces - Akundi, Ashfal, Capsule, Chikirampatnai, Jatai Balam, Kalarata and Kutipatnai - accumulated less Na and relatively more K, maintaining a lower Na/K ratio in leaves. They effectively limit sodium transport to the shoot.

CONCLUSIONS: New salt-tolerant landraces were identified that are genetically and physiologically distinct from known donors. These landraces can be used to develop better salt-tolerant varieties and could provide new sources of quantitative trait loci/alleles for salt tolerance for use in molecular breeding. The diversity observed within this set and in other donors suggests multiple mechanisms that can be combined for higher salt tolerance.
27101874	Long-term balancing selection at the Phosphorus Starvation Tolerance 1 (PSTOL1) locus in wild, domesticated and weedy rice (Oryza).	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The ability to grow in phosphorus-depleted soils is an important trait for rice cultivation in many world regions, especially in the tropics. The Phosphorus Starvation Tolerance 1 (PSTOL1) gene has been identified as underlying the ability of some cultivated rice varieties to grow under low-phosphorus conditions; however, the gene is absent from other varieties. We assessed PSTOL1 presence/absence in a geographically diverse sample of wild, domesticated and weedy rice and sequenced the gene in samples where it is present.

RESULTS: We find that the presence/absence polymorphism spans cultivated, weedy and wild Asian rice groups. For the subset of samples that carry PSTOL1, haplotype sequences suggest long-term selective maintenance of functional alleles, but with repeated evolution of loss-of-function alleles through premature stops and frameshift mutations. The loss-of-function alleles have evolved convergently in multiple rice species and cultivated rice varieties. Greenhouse assessments of plant growth under low- and high-phosphorus conditions did not reveal significant associations with PSTOL1 genotype variation; however, the striking signature of balancing selection at this locus suggests that further phenotypic characterizations of PSTOL1 allelic variants is warranted and may be useful for crop improvement.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest balancing selection for both functional and non-functional PSTOL1 alleles that predates and transcends Asian rice domestication, a pattern that may reflect fitness tradeoffs associated with geographical variation in soil phosphorus content.
27129984	Expanding the Regulatory Network for Meristem Size in Plants.	2016	Trends Genet	The remarkable plasticity of post-embryonic plant development is due to groups of stem-cell-containing structures called meristems. In the shoot, meristems continuously produce organs such as leaves, flowers, and stems. Nearly two decades ago the WUSCHEL/CLAVATA (WUS/CLV) negative feedback loop was established as being essential for regulating the size of shoot meristems by maintaining a delicate balance between stem cell proliferation and cell recruitment for the differentiation of lateral primordia. Recent research in various model species (Arabidopsis, tomato, maize, and rice) has led to discoveries of additional components that further refine and improve the current model of meristem regulation, adding new complexity to a vital network for plant growth and productivity.
27038090	A loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 associated with high cadmium accumulation in shoots and grain of Japonica rice cultivars.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Excessive cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice poses a risk to food safety. OsHMA3 plays an important role in restricting Cd translocation from roots to shoots. A non-functional allele of OsHMA3 has been reported in some Indica rice cultivars with high Cd accumulation, but it is not known if OsHMA3 allelic variation is associated with Cd accumulation in Japonica cultivars. In this study, we identified a Japonica cultivar with consistently high Cd accumulation in shoots and grain in both field and greenhouse experiments. The cultivar possesses an OsHMA3 allele with a predicted amino acid mutation at the 380(th) position from Ser to Arg. The haplotype had no Cd transport activity when the gene was expressed in yeast, and the allele did not complement a known nonfunctional allele of OsHMA3 in F1 test. The allele is present only in temperate Japonica cultivars among diversity panels of 1483 rice cultivars. Different cultivars possessing this allele showed greatly increased root-to-shoot Cd translocation and a shift in root Cd speciation from Cd-S to Cd-O bonding determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our study has identified a new loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 in Japonica rice cultivars leading to high Cd accumulation in shoots and grain.
27173278	Analysis of QTLs for panicle exsertion and its relationship with yield and yield-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Genet Mol Res	Panicle exsertion (PE) is an important morphological trait that is closely associated with spikelet fertility and grain yield. To understand the genetic basis of PE and its relationships with yield and yield-related traits, a recombinant inbred population consisting of 240 lines derived from a cross between an Indica cultivar 'Kasalath' and a Japonica germplasm 'TD70', was studied over two years. PE was significantly correlated with plant height, heading date (HD), panicle length (PL), and panicle characteristics such as primary branch number, spikelet number per panicle, and spikelet density, but showed poor correlation with yield components. Based on linkage mapping of 141 SSR markers, a total of 38 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were located for 12 investigated traits, with the contribution varying from 6.51 to 8.61%. Among these, four QTL clusters were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, and 6, suggesting the existence of pleiotropic alleles. In some intervals, two loci for PE were collocated with several traits, which is consistent with the correlations observed with phenotypic variations. The PE QTLs with 'Kasalath' alleles and without pleiotropic effects would be valuable for the improvement of PE in 'TD70' and in other rice varieties.

26853099	Three wall-associated kinases required for rice basal immunity form protein complexes in the plasma membrane.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play key roles in disease resistance, in particular basal immunity. They recognize patterns produced by the pathogen invasion and often work as complexes in the plasma membrane. Among these RLKs, there is increasing evidence in several plant species of the key role of Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) in disease resistance. We recently showed using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of three transcriptionally co-regulated OsWAK genes that individual OsWAKs are positively required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. This finding was unexpected since WAK genes belong to large gene families where functional redundancy is expected. Here we provide evidence that this may be due to complex physical interaction between OsWAK proteins.
27072282	Characterization of functional trait diversity among Indian cultivated and weedy rice populations.	2016	Sci Rep	Weedy rice, a menace in rice growing areas globally, is biosimilar having attributes similar to cultivated and wild rice, and therefore is difficult to manage. A study was initiated to characterize the functional traits of 76 weedy rice populations and commonly grown rice cultivars from different agro-climatic zones for nine morphological, five physiological, and three phenological parameters in a field experiment under an augmented block design. Comparison between weedy and cultivated rice revealed a difference in duration (days) from panicle emergence to heading as the most variable trait and awn length as the least variable one, as evidenced from their coefficients of variation. The results of principal component analysis revealed the first three principal components to represent 47.3% of the total variation, which indicates an important role of transpiration, conductance, leaf-air temperature difference, days to panicle emergence, days to heading, flag leaf length, SPAD (soil-plant analysis development), grain weight, plant height, and panicle length to the diversity in weedy rice populations. The variations existing in weedy rice population are a major reason for its wider adaptability to varied environmental conditions and also a problem while trying to manage it.
27068924	Kinetic Analysis of Zinc/Cadmium Reciprocal Competitions Suggests a Possible Zn-Insensitive Pathway for Root-to-Shoot Cadmium Translocation in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Among cereals, rice has a genetic propensity to accumulate high levels of cadmium (Cd) in grains. Xylem-mediated root-to-shoot translocation rather than root uptake has been suggested as the main physiological factor accounting for the genotypic variation observed in Cd accumulation in shoots and grains. Several evidence indicate OsHMA2 - a putative zinc (Zn) transporter - as the main candidate protein that could be involved in mediating Cd- and Zn-xylem loading in rice. However, the specific interactions between Zn and Cd in rice often appear anomalous if compared to those observed in other staple crops, suggesting that root-to-shoot Cd translocation process could be more complex than previously thought. In this study we performed a complete set of competition experiments with Zn and Cd in order to analyze their possible interactions and reciprocal effects at the root-to-shoot translocation level.

RESULTS: The competition analysis revealed the lack of a full reciprocity when considering the effect of Cd on Zn accumulation, and vice versa, since the accumulation of Zn in the shoots was progressively inhibited by Cd increases, whereas that of Cd was only partially impaired by Zn. Such behaviors were probably dependent on Cd-xylem loading mechanisms, as suggested by: i) the analysis of Zn and Cd content in the xylem sap performed in relation to the concentration of the two metals in the mobile fractions of the roots; ii) the analysis of the systemic movement of (107)Cd in short term experiments performed using a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that at least two pathways may mediate root-to-shoot Cd translocation in rice. The former could involve OsHMA2 as Zn(2+)/Cd(2+) xylem loader, whereas the latter appears to involve a Zn-insensitive system that still needs to be identified.
26969743	Overexpression of the rice AKT1 potassium channel affects potassium nutrition and rice drought tolerance.	2016	J Exp Bot	Potassium (K(+)) is the most important cationic nutrient for all living organisms and has roles in most aspects of plant physiology. To assess the impact of one of the main K(+) uptake components, the K(+) inward rectifying channel AKT1, we characterized both loss of function and overexpression of OsAKT1 in rice. In many conditions, AKT1 expression correlated with K(+) uptake and tissue K(+) levels. No salinity-related growth phenotype was observed for either loss or gain of function mutants. However, a correlation between AKT1 expression and root Na(+) when the external Na/K ratio was high suggests that there may be a role for AKT1 in Na(+) uptake in such conditions. In contrast to findings with Arabidopsis thaliana, we did not detect any change in growth of AKT1 loss of function mutants in the presence of NH4 (+) Nevertheless, NH4 (+)-dependent inhibition was detected during K(+) uptake assays in loss of function and wild type plants, depending on pre-growth conditions. The most prominent result of OsAKT1 overexpression was a reduction in sensitivity to osmotic/drought stress in transgenic plants: the data suggest that AKT1 overexpression improved rice osmotic and drought stress tolerance by increasing tissue levels of K(+), especially in the root.
26935448	Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the PP2C gene family with their expression profiling in response to multiple stresses in Brachypodium distachyon.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The type-2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), negatively regulating ABA responses and MAPK cascade pathways, play important roles in stress signal transduction in plants. Brachypodium distachyon is a new model plant for exploring the functional genomics of temperate grasses, cereals and biofuel crops. To date, genome-wide identification and analysis of the PP2C gene family in B. distachyon have not been investigated.

RESULTS: In this study, 86 PP2C genes in B. distachyon were identified. Domain-based analyses of PP2C proteins showed that they all contained the phosphatase domains featured as 11 conserved signature motifs. Although not all phosphatase domains of BdPP2C members included all 11 motifs, tertiary structure analysis showed that four residues contributing to magnesium/manganese ions (Mg(2+)/Mn(2+)) coordination were conserved, except for two noncanonical members. The analysis of their chromosomal localizations showed that most of the BdPP2C genes were located within the low CpG density region. Phylogenetic tree and synteny blocks analyses among B. distachyon, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa revealed that all PP2C members from the three species can be phylogenetically categorized into 13 subgroups (A-M) and BdPP2Cs were evolutionarily more closely related to OsPP2Cs than to AtPP2Cs. Segmental duplications contributed particularly to the expansion of the BdPP2C gene family and all duplicated BdPP2Cs evolved mainly from purifying selection. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that BdPP2Cs were broadly expressed in disparate tissues. We also found that almost all members displayed up-regulation in response to abiotic stresses such as cold, heat, PEG and NaCl treatments, but down-regulation to biotic stresses such as Ph14, Guy11 and F0968 infection.

CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide identification and characterization of protein domains, phylogenetic relationship, gene and protein structure, chromosome location and expression pattern of the PP2C gene family was carried out for the first time in a new model monocot, i.e., B. distachyon. Our results provide a reference for genome-wide identification of the PP2C gene family of other species and also provide a foundation for future functional research on PP2C genes in B. distachyon.
27029856	Identification of plant vacuolar transporters mediating phosphate storage.	2016	Nat Commun	Plant vacuoles serve as the primary intracellular compartments for inorganic phosphate (Pi) storage. Passage of Pi across vacuolar membranes plays a critical role in buffering the cytoplasmic Pi level against fluctuations of external Pi and metabolic activities. Here we demonstrate that the SPX-MFS proteins, designated as PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 5 family (PHT5), also named Vacuolar Phosphate Transporter (VPT), function as vacuolar Pi transporters. Based on (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis, Arabidopsis pht5;1 loss-of-function mutants accumulate less Pi and exhibit a lower vacuolar-to-cytoplasmic Pi ratio than controls. Conversely, overexpression of PHT5 leads to massive Pi sequestration into vacuoles and altered regulation of Pi starvation-responsive genes. Furthermore, we show that heterologous expression of the rice homologue OsSPX-MFS1 mediates Pi influx to yeast vacuoles. Our findings show that a group of Pi transporters in vacuolar membranes regulate cytoplasmic Pi homeostasis and are required for fitness and plant growth.
26987543	Development and validation of allele-specific SNP/indel markers for eight yield-enhancing genes using whole-genome sequencing strategy to increase yield potential of rice, Oryza sativa L.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the major staple foods in the world, especially in the developing countries of Asia. Its consumption as a dietary source is also increasing in Africa. To meet the demand for rice to feed the increasing human population, increasing rice yield is essential. Improving the genetic yield potential of rice is one ideal solution. It is imperative to introduce the identified yield-enhancing gene(s) into modern rice cultivars for the rapid improvement of yield potential through marker-assisted breeding.

RESULTS: We report the development of PCR-gel-based markers for eight yield-related functional genes (Gn1a, OsSPL14, SCM2, Ghd7, DEP1, SPIKE, GS5, and TGW6) to introduce yield-positive alleles from the donor lines. Six rice cultivars, including three each of donor and recipient lines, respectively, were sequenced by next-generation whole-genome sequencing to detect DNA polymorphisms between the genotypes. Additionally, PCR products containing functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) or putative FNPs for yield-related genes were sequenced. DNA polymorphisms discriminating yield-positive alleles and non-target alleles for each gene were selected through sequence analysis and the allele-specific PCR-gel-based markers were developed. The markers were validated with our intermediate breeding lines produced from crosses between the donors and 12 elite indica rice cultivars as recipients. Automated capillary electrophoresis was tested and fluorescence-labeled SNP genotyping markers (Fluidigm SNP genotyping platform) for Gn1a, OsSPL14, Ghd7, GS5, and GS3 genes were developed for high-throughput genotyping.

CONCLUSIONS: The SNP/indel markers linked to yield related genes functioned properly in our marker-assisted breeding program with identified high yield potential lines. These markers can be utilized in local favorite rice cultivars for yield enhancement. The marker designing strategy using both next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing methods can be used for suitable marker development of other genes associated with useful agronomic traits.
26979310	Molecular evolution and gene expression differences within the HD-Zip transcription factor family of Zea mays L.	2016	Genetica	Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factors regulate developmental processes and stress responses in plants, and they vary widely in gene number and family structure. In this study, 55 predicted maize HD-Zip genes were systematically analyzed with respect to their phylogenetic relationships, molecular evolution, and gene expression in order to understand the functional diversification within the family. Phylogenetic analysis of HD-Zip proteins from Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, and Physcomitrella patens showed that they group into four classes. We inferred that the copy numbers of classes I and III genes were relatively conserved in all five species. The 55 maize HD-Zip genes are distributed randomly on the ten chromosomes, with 15 segmental duplication and 4 tandem duplication events, suggesting that segmental duplications were the major contributors in the expansion of the maize HD-Zip gene family. Expression analysis of the 55 maize HD-Zip genes in different tissues and drought conditions revealed differences in the expression levels and patterns between the four classes. Promoter analysis revealed that a number of stress response-, hormone response-, light response-, and development-related cis-acting elements were present in their promoters. Our results provide novel insights into the molecular evolution and gene expression within the HD-Zip gene family in maize, and provide a solid foundation for future functional study of the HD-Zip genes in maize.
26979747	Genetic and biochemical mechanisms of rice resistance to planthopper.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: This article presents a comprehensive review on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms governing rice-planthopper interactions, aiming to contribute substantial planthopper control and facilitate breeding for resistance to planthoppers in rice. The rice planthopper is the most destructive pest of rice and a substantial threat to rice production. The brown planthopper (BPH), white-backed planthopper (WBPH) and small brown planthopper (SBPH) are three species of delphacid planthoppers and important piercing-sucking pests of rice. Host-plant resistance has been recognized as the most practical, economical and environmentally friendly strategy to control planthoppers. Until now, at least 30, 14 and 34 major genes/quantitative trait loci for resistance to BPH, WBPH and SBPH have been identified, respectively. Recent inheritance and molecular mapping of gene analysis showed that some planthopper-resistance genes in rice derived from different donors aggregate in clusters, while resistance to these three species of planthoppers in a single donor is governed not by any one dominant gene but by multiple genes. Notably, Bph14, Bph26, Bph3 and Bph29 were successfully identified as BPH-resistance genes in rice. Biological and chemical studies on the feeding of planthoppers indicate that rice plants have acquired various forms of defence against planthoppers. Between the rice-planthopper interactions, rice plants defend against planthoppers through activation the salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance but not jasmonate-dependent hormone response pathways. Transgenic rice for the planthopper-resistance mechanism shows that jasmonate and its metabolites function diversely in rice's resistance to planthopper. Understanding the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying resistance in rice will contribute to the substantial control of such pests and facilitate breeding for rice's resistance to planthopper more efficiently.
27153728	IsomiR Bank: a research resource for tracking IsomiRs.	2016	Bioinformatics	UNLABELLED: : Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are capable of exhibiting frequent differences from their corresponding mature reference sequences, generating multiple variants: the isoforms of miRNAs (isomiRs). These isomiRs mainly originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage during the pre-miRNA processing and post-transcriptional modifications that influence miRNA stability, their sub-cellular localization and target selection. Although several tools for the identification of isomiR have been reported, no bioinformatics resource dedicated to gather isomiRs from public NGS data and to provide functional analysis of these isomiRs is available to date. Thus, a free online database, IsomiR Bank has been created to integrate isomiRs detected by our previously published algorithm CPSS. In total, 2727 samples (Small RNA NGS data downloaded from ArrayExpress) from eight species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays) are analyzed. At present, 308 919 isomiRs from 4706 mature miRNAs are collected into IsomiR Bank. In addition, IsomiR Bank provides target prediction and enrichment analysis to evaluate the effects of isomiRs on target selection.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: IsomiR Bank is implemented in PHP/PERL + MySQL + R format and can be freely accessed at http://mcg.ustc.edu.cn/bsc/isomir/

27031246	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	2016	PLoS Pathog	Although nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are the major immune receptors in plants, the mechanism that controls their activation and immune signaling remains elusive. Here, we report that the avirulence effector AvrPiz-t from Magnaporthe oryzae targets the rice E3 ligase APIP10 for degradation, but that APIP10, in return, ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t and thereby causes its degradation. Silencing of APIP10 in the non-Piz-t background compromises the basal defense against M. oryzae. Conversely, silencing of APIP10 in the Piz-t background causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, suggesting that APIP10 is a negative regulator of Piz-t. We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AvrPiz-t stabilizes Piz-t during M. oryzae infection. Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that functionally connects the fungal effector AvrPiz-t to its NLR receptor Piz-t in rice.
26951048	Genome-wide identification of WRKY family genes in peach and analysis of WRKY expression during bud dormancy.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Bud dormancy in deciduous fruit trees is an important adaptive mechanism for their survival in cold climates. The WRKY genes participate in several developmental and physiological processes, including dormancy. However, the dormancy mechanisms of WRKY genes have not been studied in detail. We conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 58 WRKY genes in peach. These putative genes were located on all eight chromosomes. In bioinformatics analyses, we compared the sequences of WRKY genes from peach, rice, and Arabidopsis. In a cluster analysis, the gene sequences formed three groups, of which group II was further divided into five subgroups. Gene structure was highly conserved within each group, especially in groups IId and III. Gene expression analyses by qRT-PCR showed that WRKY genes showed different expression patterns in peach buds during dormancy. The mean expression levels of six WRKY genes (Prupe.6G286000, Prupe.1G393000, Prupe.1G114800, Prupe.1G071400, Prupe.2G185100, and Prupe.2G307400) increased during endodormancy and decreased during ecodormancy, indicating that these six WRKY genes may play a role in dormancy in a perennial fruit tree. This information will be useful for selecting fruit trees with desirable dormancy characteristics or for manipulating dormancy in genetic engineering programs.
26850149	Mitochondrial ORF79 levels determine pollen abortion in cytoplasmic male sterile rice.	2016	Plant J	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an important agricultural trait characterized by lack of functional pollen, and caused by ectopic and defective mitochondrial gene expression. The pollen function in CMS plants is restored by the presence of nuclear-encoded restorer of fertility (Rf) genes. Previously, we cloned Rf2, which restores the fertility of Lead Rice (LD)-type CMS rice. However, neither the function of Rf2 nor the identity of the mitochondrial gene causing CMS has been determined in LD-CMS rice. Here, we show that the mitochondrial gene orf79 acts as a CMS-associated gene in LD-CMS rice, similar to its role in BT-CMS rice originating from Chinsurah Boro II, and Rf2 weakly restores fertility in BT-CMS rice. We also show that RF2 promotes degradation of atp6-orf79 RNA in a different manner from that of RF1, which is the Rf gene product in BT-CMS rice. The amount of ORF79 protein in LD-CMS rice was one-twentieth of the amount in BT-CMS rice. The difference in ORF79 protein levels probably accounts for the mild and severe pollen defects in LD-CMS and BT-CMS rice, respectively. In the presence of Rf2, accumulation of ORF79 was reduced to almost zero and 25% in LD-CMS and BT-CMS rice, respectively, which probably accounts for the complete and weak fertility restoration abilities of Rf2 in LD-CMS and BT-CMS rice, respectively. These observations indicate that the amount of ORF79 influences the pollen fertility in two strains of rice in which CMS is induced by orf79.
27017433	iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis reveals the mechanisms of silicon-mediated cadmium tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) cells.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Silicon (Si) can alleviate cadmium (Cd) stress in rice (Oryza sativa) plants, however, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the single-cell level remains limited. To address these questions, we investigated suspension cells of rice cultured in the dark environment in the absence and presence of Si with either short- (12 h) or long-term (5 d) Cd treatments using a combination of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), fluorescent staining, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). We identified 100 proteins differentially regulated by Si under the short- or long-term Cd stress. 70% of these proteins were down-regulated, suggesting that Si may improve protein use efficiency by maintaining cells in the normal physiological status. Furthermore, we showed two different mechanisms for Si-mediated Cd tolerance. Under the short-term Cd stress, the Si-modified cell walls inhibited the uptake of Cd ions into cells and consequently reduced the expressions of glycosidase, cell surface non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs), and several stress-related proteins. Under the long-term Cd stress, the amount of Cd in the cytoplasm in Si-accumulating (+Si) cells was decreased by compartmentation of Cd into vacuoles, thus leading to a lower expression of glutathione S-transferases (GST). These results provide protein-level insights into the Si-mediated Cd detoxification in rice single cells.
26809460	Rearrangement of nitrogen metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under salt stress.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Salt stress is an important environmental condition limiting the agricultural production. The reprogram of protein expression is one of the strategies of plants to cope with salt stress. We have previously analyzed the photosynthesis, antioxidant and oxidative phosphorylation involved in the carbon metabolism and the redox metabolism in rice seedlings under salt stress. Here, we focused on the proteins involved in nitrogen metabolic response. As it was reported that the nitrite uptake was enhanced in Arabidopsis PII knock-out mutants, the down-regulation of P-II nitrogen sensing protein in rice probably contributes to the accumulation of amino acids under stress. In addition, the protein synthesis is limited by the decrease of related proteins, and more amino acids could be used as the compatible solute. Hence, our study indicates that the rearrangement of nitrogen metabolism under salt stress could accumulate more amino acids as the compatible solute rather than the components of proteins. This study provides information for an improved understanding of nitrogen metabolic response to salt stress in rice.
26926666	Genome-wide DNA polymorphism in the indica rice varieties RGD-7S and Taifeng B as revealed by whole genome re-sequencing.	2016	Genome	Next-generation sequencing technologies provide opportunities to further understand genetic variation, even within closely related cultivars. We performed whole genome resequencing of two elite indica rice varieties, RGD-7S and Taifeng B, whose F1 progeny showed hybrid weakness and hybrid vigor when grown in the early- and late-cropping seasons, respectively. Approximately 150 million 100-bp pair-end reads were generated, which covered ∼86% of the rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica 'Nipponbare') reference genome. A total of 2,758,740 polymorphic sites including 2,408,845 SNPs and 349,895 InDels were detected in RGD-7S and Taifeng B, respectively. Applying stringent parameters, we identified 961,791 SNPs and 46,640 InDels between RGD-7S and Taifeng B (RGD-7S/Taifeng B). The density of DNA polymorphisms was 256.8 SNPs and 12.5 InDels per 100 kb for RGD-7S/Taifeng B. Copy number variations (CNVs) were also investigated. In RGD-7S, 1989 of 2727 CNVs were overlapped in 218 genes, and 1231 of 2010 CNVs were annotated in 175 genes in Taifeng B. In addition, we verified a subset of InDels in the interval of hybrid weakness genes, Hw3 and Hw4, and obtained some polymorphic InDel markers, which will provide a sound foundation for cloning hybrid weakness genes. Analysis of genomic variations will also contribute to understanding the genetic basis of hybrid weakness and heterosis.
26969003	miR2118-triggered phased siRNAs are differentially expressed during the panicle development of wild and domesticated African rice species.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice exhibits a wide range of panicle structures. To explain these variations, much emphasis has been placed on changes in transcriptional regulation, but no large-scale study has yet reported on changes in small RNA regulation in the various rice species. To evaluate this aspect, we performed deep sequencing and expression profiling of small RNAs from two closely related species with contrasting panicle development: the cultivated African rice Oryza glaberrima and its wild relative Oryza barthii.

RESULTS: Our RNA-seq analysis revealed a dramatic difference between the two species in the 21 nucleotide small RNA population, corresponding mainly to miR2118-triggered phased siRNAs. A detailed expression profiling during the panicle development of O. glaberrima and O. barthii using qRT-PCRs and in situ hybridization, confirmed a delayed expression of the phased siRNAs as well as their lncRNA precursors and regulators (miR2118 and MEL1 gene) in O. glaberrima compared to O. barthii. We provide evidence that the 21-nt phasiRNA pathway in rice is associated with male-gametogenesis but is initiated in spikelet meristems.

CONCLUSION: Differential expression of the miR2118-triggered 21-nt phasiRNA pathway between the two African rice species reflects differential rates of determinate fate acquisition of panicle meristems between the two species.

27029818	Transcriptome analysis in different rice cultivars provides novel insights into desiccation and salinity stress responses.	2016	Sci Rep	Drought and salinity are the major environmental factors that affect rice productivity. Comparative transcriptome analysis between tolerant and sensitive rice cultivars can provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in these stress responses. In this study, the comparison of transcriptomes of a drought-tolerant [Nagina 22 (N22)] and a salinity-tolerant (Pokkali) rice cultivar with IR64 (susceptible cultivar) revealed variable transcriptional responses under control and stress conditions. A total of 801 and 507 transcripts were exclusively differentially expressed in N22 and Pokkali rice cultivars, respectively, under stress conditions. Gene ontology analysis suggested the enrichment of transcripts involved in response to abiotic stress and regulation of gene expression in stress-tolerant rice cultivars. A larger number of transcripts encoding for members of NAC and DBP transcription factor (TF) families in N22 and members of bHLH and C2H2 TF families in Pokkali exhibited differential regulation under desiccation and salinity stresses, respectively. Transcripts encoding for thioredoxin and involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism were up-regulated in N22, whereas transcripts involved in wax and terpenoid metabolism were up-regulated in Pokkali. Overall, common and cultivar-specific stress-responsive transcripts identified in this study can serve as a helpful resource to explore novel candidate genes for abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
26979330	Phosphate Treatment Strongly Inhibits New Arbuscule Development But Not the Maintenance of Arbuscule in Mycorrhizal Rice Roots.	2016	Plant Physiol	Phosphorus (P) is a crucial nutrient for plant growth, but its availability to roots is limited in soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a promising strategy for improving plant P acquisition. However, P fertilizer reduces fungal colonization (P inhibition) and compromises mycorrhizal P uptake, warranting studies on the mechanistic basis of P inhibition. In this study, early morphological changes in P inhibition were identified in rice (Oryza sativa) using fungal cell wall staining and live-cell imaging of plant membranes that were associated with arbuscule life cycles. Arbuscule density decreased, and aberrant hyphal branching was observed in roots at 5 h after P treatment. Although new arbuscule development was severely inhibited, preformed arbuscules remained intact and longevity remained constant. P inhibition was accelerated in the rice pt11-1 mutant, which lacks P uptake from arbuscule branches, suggesting that mature arbuscules are stabilized by the symbiotic P transporter under high P condition. Moreover, P treatment led to increases in the number of vesicles, in which lipid droplets accumulated and then decreased within a few days. The development of new arbuscules resumed within by 2 d. Our data established that P strongly and temporarily inhibits new arbuscule development, but not intraradical accommodation of AM fungi.
27155375	Comprehensive analysis of plant rapid alkalization factor (RALF) genes.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Receptor mediated signal carriers play a critical role in the regulation of plant defense and development. Rapid alkalization factor (RALF) proteins potentially comprise important signaling components which may have a key role in plant biology. The RALF gene family contains large number of genes in several plant species, however, only a few RALF genes have been characterized to date. In this study, an extensive database search identified 39, 43, 34 and 18 RALF genes in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and soybean, respectively. These RALF genes were found to be highly conserved across the 4 plant species. A comprehensive analysis including the chromosomal location, gene structure, subcellular location, conserved motifs, protein structure, protein-ligand interaction and promoter analysis was performed. RALF genes from four plant species were divided into 7 groups based on phylogenetic analysis. In silico expression analysis of these genes, using microarray and EST data, revealed that these genes exhibit a variety of expression patterns. Furthermore, RALF genes showed distinct expression patterns of transcript accumulation in vivo following nitrosative and oxidative stresses in Arabidopsis. Predicted interaction between RALF and heme ligand also showed that RALF proteins may contribute towards transporting or scavenging oxygen moieties. This suggests a possible role for RALF genes during changes in cellular redox status. Collectively, our data provides a valuable resource to prime future research in the role of RALF genes in plant growth and development.
26991872	Hd1,a CONSTANS ortholog in rice, functions as an Ehd1 repressor through interaction with monocot-specific CCT-domain protein Ghd7.	2016	Plant J	Flowering time is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yields. In cereals, several CCT-domain proteins unique to monocots, such as Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) gene, have been identified as key floral repressors, although the corresponding molecular mechanisms have been unknown until now. In rice, a short-day plant, Heading date 1 (Hd1) gene, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis floral activator CONSTANS (CO), represses flowering under non-inductive long-day (LD) conditions and induces it under inductive short-day (SD) conditions. Here, we report biological interactions between Ghd7 and Hd1, which together repress Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), a key floral inducer under non-inductive LD conditions. In addition to this genetic interaction between them, Co-IP experiments further demonstrated that a Ghd7-Hd1 protein formed a complex in vivo and ChIP and luciferase reporter analyses suggested that this complex specifically binds to a cis-regulatory region in Ehd1 and represses its expression. These findings imply that Hd1, an evolutionally conserved transcriptional activator, can function as a strong transcriptional repressor within a monocot-specific flowering-time pathway through with Ghd7.
26929041	Chemical modification of a phenoxyfuranone-type strigolactone mimic for selective effects on rice tillering or Striga hermonthica seed germination.	2016	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a series of phenoxyfuranone compounds, designated 'debranones', mimic strigolactone (SL) activity. 4-Bromodebranone (4BD) is a functionally selective SL mimic that reduces the number of shoot branches on rice more potently than GR24, a typical synthetic SL analogue, but does not induce seed germination in the root-parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. To enhance the selective activity of debranones in stimulating the seed germination of root-parasitic plants, we prepared several analogues of 4BD in which the chlorine atom was substituted with an H atom at the o-, m- or p-position on the phenyl ring (designated 2-, 3-, or 4-chlorodebranone, respectively) or had a bicyclic group instead of the phenyl ring. We evaluated the biological activities of the compounds with rice tillering assays and S. hermonthica seed germination assays.

RESULTS: Both assays showed that the substituent position affected debranone efficiency, and among the monochlorodebranones, 2-chlorodebranone was more effective than the other two isomers in both assays. When the activities of the bicyclic debranones were compared in the same two assays, one was more active than GR24 in the rice tillering assay. This debranone also stimulated the germination of S. hermonthica seeds. Thus, some debranone derivatives induced the germination of S. hermonthica seeds, although their activities were still ∼1/20 that of GR24.

CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that further and rigorous structure-activity relationship studies of the debranones will identify derivatives that more potently stimulate the suicidal germination of S. hermonthica seeds. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.
27012284	SUMO proteases: uncovering the roles of deSUMOylation in plants.	2016	J Exp Bot	Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. These post-translational modifiers (PMs) can alter stability, protein-protein interactions, and the overall fate of the protein. Both of these systems have remarkable similarities in terms of the process leading to attachment of the PM to its substrate : having to undertake activation, conjugation, and finally ligation to the target. In the ubiquitin system, there are a vast number of ubiquitin ligase enzymes (E3s) that provide specificity for the attachment of ubiquitin. With the SUMO system, only a small number of SUMO E3 ligases have so far been identified in the fully sequenced plant genomes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are only two SUMO E3s, compared to over 1400 ubiquitin E3s, a trend also observed in crop species such as Oryza sativa and Zea mays Recent research indicates that removing SUMO from its substrate by the enzymatically active SUMO proteases is a vital part of this system. A class of SUMO proteases called ubiquitin-like proteases (ULPs) are widespread in all eukaryotes; within plants, both monocot and dicot kingdoms have conserved and divergent ULPs and ULP-like proteases. This paper examines the roles ULPs have in stress responses and highlights the 'fine-tuning' of SUMO attachment/removal in balancing growth versus stress.
27019432	Evolution of the defensin-like gene family in grass genomes.	2016	J Genet	Plant defensins are small, diverse, cysteine-rich peptides, belonging to a group of pathogenesis-related defense mechanism proteins, which can provide a barrier against a broad range of pathogens. In this study, 51 defensin-like (DEFL) genes in Gramineae, including brachypodium, rice, maize and sorghum were identified based on bioinformatics methods. Using the synteny analysis method, we found that 21 DEFL genes formed 30 pairs of duplicated blocks that have undergone large-scale duplication events, mostly occurring between species. In particular, some chromosomal regions are highly conserved in the four grasses. Using mean Ks values, we estimated the approximate time of divergence for each pair of duplicated regions and found that these regions generally diverged more than 40 million years ago (Mya). Selection pressure analysis showed that the DEFL gene family is subjected to purifying selection. However, sliding window analysis detected partial reg ions of duplicated genes under positive selection. The evolutionary patterns within DEFL gene families among grasses can be used to explore the subsequent functional divergence of duplicated genes and to further analyse the antimicrobial effects of defensins during plant development.
26984283	Indica rice genome assembly, annotation and mining of blast disease resistance genes.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice is a major staple food crop in the world. Over 80% of rice cultivation area is under indica rice. Currently, genomic resources are lacking for indica as compared to japonica rice. In this study, we generated deep-sequencing data (Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing) for one of the indica rice cultivars, HR-12 from India.

RESULTS: We assembled over 86% (389 Mb) of rice genome and annotated 56,284 protein-coding genes from HR-12 genome using Illumina and PacBio sequencing. Comprehensive comparative analyses between indica and japonica subspecies genomes revealed a large number of indica specific variants including SSRs, SNPs and InDels. To mine disease resistance genes, we sequenced few indica rice cultivars that are reported to be highly resistant (Tetep and Tadukan) and susceptible (HR-12 and Co-39) against blast fungal isolates in many countries including India. Whole genome sequencing of rice genotypes revealed high rate of mutations in defense related genes (NB-ARC, LRR and PK domains) in resistant cultivars as compared to susceptible. This study has identified R-genes Pi-ta and Pi54 from durable indica resistant cultivars; Tetep and Tadukan, which can be used in marker assisted selection in rice breeding program.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of whole genome sequencing approach to characterize Indian rice germplasm. The genomic resources from our work will have a greater impact in understanding global rice diversity, genetics and molecular breeding.
26929151	Cell wall targeted in planta iron accumulation enhances biomass conversion and seed iron concentration in Arabidopsis and rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Conversion of nongrain biomass into liquid fuel is a sustainable approach to energy demands as global population increases. Previously, we showed that iron can act as a catalyst to enhance the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. However, direct addition of iron catalysts to biomass pretreatment is diffusion-limited, would increase the cost and complexity of biorefinery unit operations and may have deleterious environmental impacts. Here, we show a new strategy for in planta accumulation of iron throughout the volume of the cell wall where iron acts as a catalyst in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. We engineered CBM-IBP fusion polypeptides composed of a carbohydrate-binding module family 11 (CBM11) and an iron-binding peptide (IBP) for secretion into Arabidopsis and rice cell walls. CBM-IBP transformed Arabidopsis and rice plants show significant increases in iron accumulation and biomass conversion compared to respective controls. Further, CBM-IBP rice shows a 35% increase in seed iron concentration and a 40% increase in seed yield in greenhouse experiments. CBM-IBP rice potentially could be used to address iron deficiency, the most common and widespread nutritional disorder according to the World Health Organization.
27015846	Molecular evidence for biochemical diversification of phenolamide biosynthesis in rice plants.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Two phenolamides (PAs), p-coumaroylputrescine and feruloylputrescine strongly accumulate in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) leaves subjected to attack of chewing and sucking herbivores. Here we identified and characterized in vitro three novel rice genes that mediated coumaroyl-CoA/feruloyl-CoA conjugation to polyamines, putrescine and agmatine. Interestingly, two genes were highly specific for their polyamine substrates, encoding putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase and agmatine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, while the third enzyme could use both polyamines and it was therefore annotated as putrescine/agmatine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase. All genes were preferentially expressed in rice roots and developing flowers, and in addition, the putrescine/agmatine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase transcripts were strongly induced by wounding in the young rice leaves. Because the wound response of this gene was only partially suppressed in the jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine deficient plants (Osjar1), it suggests that its upregulation (as well as inducible PAs in rice) may be largely independent of jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine signaling pathway. The finding of three closely related genes with a similar and/or overlapping activity in PA biosynthesis provides another striking example of rapid diversification of plant metabolism in response to environmental stresses in nature.
27003905	Transferring an optimized TAP-toolbox for the isolation of protein complexes to a portfolio of rice tissues.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Proteins are the cell's functional entities. Rather than operating independently, they interact with other proteins. Capturing in vivo protein complexes is therefore crucial to gain understanding of the function of a protein in a cellular context. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry has proven to yield a wealth of information about protein complex constitutions for a broad range of organisms. For Oryza sativa, the technique has been initiated in callus and shoots, but has not been optimized ever since. We translated an optimized tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach from Arabidopsis thaliana toward Oryza sativa, and demonstrate its applicability in a variety of rice tissues. A list of non-specific and false positive interactors is presented, based on re-occurrence over more than 170 independent experiments, to filter bona fide interactors. We demonstrate the sensitivity of our approach by isolating the complexes for the rice ANAPHASE PROMOTING COMPLEX SUBUNIT 10 (APC10) and CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE D (CDKD) proteins from the proliferation zone of the emerging fourth leaf. Next to APC10 and CDKD, we tested several additional baits in the different rice tissues and reproducibly retrieved at least one interactor for 81.4 % of the baits screened for in callus tissue and T1 seedlings. By transferring an optimized TAP tag combined with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, our TAP protocol enables the discovery of interactors for low abundance proteins in rice and opens the possibility to capture complex dynamics by comparing tissues at different stages of a developing rice organ.
26991510	Shoot tolerance mechanisms to iron toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Iron toxicity frequently affects lowland rice and leads to oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction. Tolerance mechanisms were investigated in contrasting genotypes: the intolerant IR29 and the tolerant recombinant inbred line FL483. Seedlings were exposed to 1000 mg L-1 ferrous iron, and the regulation of genes involved in three hypothetical tolerance mechanisms was investigated (I) Iron uptake, partitioning and storage. The iron concentration and speciation in different plant tissues did not differ significantly between genotypes. Sub-cellular iron partitioning genes such as vacuolar iron transporters or ferritin showed no genotypic differences. (II) Antioxidant biosynthesis. Only one gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis showed genotypic differences, but carotenoids are unlikely to scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in Fe toxicity, i.e. H2 O2 and hydroxyl radicals. (III) Enzymatic activities for ROS scavenging and antioxidants turnover. In shoots, glutathione-S-transferase and ascorbate oxidase genes showed genotypic differences, and consistently, the tolerant FL483 had lower dehydroascorbate reductase and higher ascorbate oxidase activity, suggesting that high rates ascorbate reduction confer sensitivity. This hypothesis was confirmed by application of exogenous reduced ascorbate or L-galactono-1,4-lactone, which increased lipid peroxidation under iron toxic conditions. Our results demonstrate in planta pro-oxidant activity of reduced ascorbate in the presence of iron.
26954091	The Oryza sativa Regulator HDR1 Associates with the Kinase OsK4 to Control Photoperiodic Flowering.	2016	PLoS Genet	Rice is a facultative short-day plant (SDP), and the regulatory pathways for flowering time are conserved, but functionally modified, in Arabidopsis and rice. Heading date 1 (Hd1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO), is a key regulator that suppresses flowering under long-day conditions (LDs), but promotes flowering under short-day conditions (SDs) by influencing the expression of the florigen gene Heading date 3a (Hd3a). Another key regulator, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), is an evolutionarily unique gene with no orthologs in Arabidopsis, which acts as a flowering activator under both SD and LD by promoting the rice florigen genes Hd3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUST 1 (RFT1). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the flowering regulator Heading Date Repressor1 (HDR1) in rice. The hdr1 mutant exhibits an early flowering phenotype under natural LD in a paddy field in Beijing, China (39°54'N, 116°23'E), as well as under LD but not SD in a growth chamber, indicating that HDR1 may functionally regulate flowering time via the photoperiod-dependent pathway. HDR1 encodes a nuclear protein that is most active in leaves and floral organs and exhibits a typical diurnal expression pattern. We determined that HDR1 is a novel suppressor of flowering that upregulates Hd1 and downregulates Ehd1, leading to the downregulation of Hd3a and RFT1 under LDs. We have further identified an HDR1-interacting kinase, OsK4, another suppressor of rice flowering under LDs. OsK4 acts similarly to HDR1, suppressing flowering by upregulating Hd1 and downregulating Ehd1 under LDs, and OsK4 can phosphorylate HD1 with HDR1 presents. These results collectively reveal the transcriptional regulators of Hd1 for the day-length-dependent control of flowering time in rice.
27009386	Genome-Wide Identification of R2R3-MYB Genes and Expression Analyses During Abiotic Stress in Gossypium raimondii.	2016	Sci Rep	The R2R3-MYB is one of the largest families of transcription factors, which have been implicated in multiple biological processes. There is great diversity in the number of R2R3-MYB genes in different plants. However, there is no report on genome-wide characterization of this gene family in cotton. In the present study, a total of 205 putative R2R3-MYB genes were identified in cotton D genome (Gossypium raimondii), that are much larger than that found in other cash crops with fully sequenced genomes. These GrMYBs were classified into 13 groups with the R2R3-MYB genes from Arabidopsis and rice. The amino acid motifs and phylogenetic tree were predicted and analyzed. The sequences of GrMYBs were distributed across 13 chromosomes at various densities. The results showed that the expansion of the G. Raimondii R2R3-MYB family was mainly attributable to whole genome duplication and segmental duplication. Moreover, the expression pattern of 52 selected GrMYBs and 46 GaMYBs were tested in roots and leaves under different abiotic stress conditions. The results revealed that the MYB genes in cotton were differentially expressed under salt and drought stress treatment. Our results will be useful for determining the precise role of the MYB genes during stress responses with crop improvement.
26945049	A Drought-Inducible Transcription Factor Delays Reproductive Timing in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	The molecular mechanisms underlying photoperiod or temperature control of flowering time have been recently elucidated, but how plants regulate flowering time in response to other external factors, such as water availability, remains poorly understood. Using a large-scale Hybrid Transcription Factor approach, we identified a bZIP transcriptional factor, O. sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1 (OsABF1), which acts as a suppressor of floral transition in a photoperiod-independent manner. Simultaneous knockdown of both OsABF1 and its closest homologous gene, OsbZIP40, in rice (Oryza sativa) by RNA interference results in a significantly earlier flowering phenotype. Molecular and genetic analyses demonstrate that a drought regime enhances expression of the OsABF1 gene, which indirectly suppresses expression of the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene that encodes a key activator of rice flowering. Furthermore, we identified a drought-inducible gene named OsWRKY104 that is under the direct regulation of OsABF1 Overexpression of OsWRKY104 can suppress Ehd1 expression and confers a later flowering phenotype in rice. Together, these findings reveal a novel pathway by which rice modulates heading date in response to the change of ambient water availability.
26993328	Elucidation of salt-tolerance metabolic pathways in contrasting rice genotypes and their segregating progenies.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Differentially expressed antioxidant enzymes, amino acids and proteins in contrasting rice genotypes, and co-location of their genes in the QTLs mapped using bi-parental population, indicated their role in salt tolerance. Soil salinity is a major environmental constraint limiting rice productivity. Salt-tolerant 'CSR27', salt-sensitive 'MI48'and their extreme tolerant and sensitive recombinant inbred line (RIL) progenies were used for the elucidation of salt stress tolerance metabolic pathways. Salt stress-mediated biochemical and molecular changes were analyzed in the two parents along with bulked-tolerant (BT) and bulked-sensitive (BS) extreme RILs. The tolerant parent and BT RILs suffered much lower reduction in the chlorophyll as compared to their sensitive counterparts. Activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) and non-enzymatic antioxidant ascorbic acid were much higher in salt-stressed CSR27 and BT RILs than MI48 and BS RILs. Further, the tolerant lines showed significant enhancement in the levels of amino acids methionine and proline in response to salt stress in comparison to the sensitive lines. Similarly, the tolerant genotypes showed minimal reduction in cysteine content whereas sensitive genotypes showed a sharp reduction. Real time PCR analysis confirmed the induction of methionine biosynthetic pathway (MBP) enzymes cystathionine-β synthase (CbS), S-adenosyl methionine synthase (SAMS), S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) and serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) genes in tolerant lines, suggesting potential role of the MBP in conferring salt tolerance in rice variety CSR27. Proteome profiling also confirmed higher expression of SOD, POD and plastidic CbS and other proteins in the tolerant lines, whose genes were co-located in the QTL intervals for salt tolerance mapped in the RIL population. The study signifies integrated biochemical-molecular approach for identifying salt tolerance genes for genetic improvement for stress tolerant rice varieties.
26959033	Deriving the Characteristic Scale for Effectively Monitoring Heavy Metal Stress in Rice by Assimilation of GF-1 Data with the WOFOST Model.	2016	Sensors (Basel)	Accurate monitoring of heavy metal stress in crops is of great importance to assure agricultural productivity and food security, and remote sensing is an effective tool to address this problem. However, given that Earth observation instruments provide data at multiple scales, the choice of scale for use in such monitoring is challenging. This study focused on identifying the characteristic scale for effectively monitoring heavy metal stress in rice using the dry weight of roots (WRT) as the representative characteristic, which was obtained by assimilation of GF-1 data with the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model. We explored and quantified the effect of the important state variable LAI (leaf area index) at various spatial scales on the simulated rice WRT to find the critical scale for heavy metal stress monitoring using the statistical characteristics. Furthermore, a ratio analysis based on the varied heavy metal stress levels was conducted to identify the characteristic scale. Results indicated that the critical threshold for investigating the rice WRT in monitoring studies of heavy metal stress was larger than 64 m but smaller than 256 m. This finding represents a useful guideline for choosing the most appropriate imagery.
27000876	The Rice TCM5 Gene Encoding a Novel Deg Protease Protein is Essential for Chloroplast Development under High Temperatures.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: High temperature affects a broad spectrum of cellular components and metabolism in plants. The Deg/HtrA family of ATP-independent serine endopeptidases is present in nearly all organisms. Deg proteases are required for the survival of Escherichia coli at high temperatures. However, it is still unclear whether rice Deg proteases are required for chloroplast development under high temperatures.

RESULTS: In this study, we reported the first rice deg mutant tcm5 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 5) that has an albino phenotype, defective chloroplasts and could not survive after the 4-5 leaf seedling stage when grown at high temperature (32 °C). However, when grown at low temperatures (20 °C), tcm5 has a normal phenotype. Map-based cloning showed that TCM5 encoding a chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein. The TCM5 transcripts were highly expressed in all green tissues and undetectable in other tissues, showing the tissue-specific expression. In tcm5 mutants grown at high temperatures, the transcript levels of certain genes associated with chloroplast development especially PSII-associated genes were severely affected, but recovered to normal levels at low temperatures. These results showed important role of TCM5 for chloroplast development under high temperatures.

CONCLUSIONS: The TCM5 encodes chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein which is important for chloroplast development and the maintenance of PSII function and its disruption would lead to a defective chloroplast and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early rice seedling stage under high temperatures.
26991499	Non-specific phospholipase C1 affects silicon distribution and mechanical strength in stem nodes of rice.	2016	Plant J	Silicon, the second abundant element in the crust, is beneficial for plant growth, mechanical strength, and stress responses. Here we show that manipulation of the non-specific phospholipase C1, NPC1, alters silicon content in nodes and husks of rice (Oryza sativa). Silicon content in NPC1-overexpressing (OE) plants was decreased in nodes but increased in husks compared to wild-type, whereas RNAi suppression of NPC1 resulted in the opposite changes to those of NPC1-OE plants. NPC1 from rice hydrolyzed phospholipids and galactolipids to generate diacylglycerol that can be phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid interacts with Lsi6, a silicon transporter that is expressed at the highest level in nodes. In addition, the node cells of NPC1-OE plants have lower contents of cellulose and hemicellulose, and thinner sclerenchyma and vascular bundle fibre cells than wild-type plants; whereas NPC1-RNAi plants displayed the opposite changes. These data indicate that NPC1 modulates silicon distribution and secondary cell wall deposition in nodes and grains, affecting mechanical strength and seed shattering.
27180265	TALEN-Mediated Homologous Recombination Produces Site-Directed DNA Base Change and Herbicide-Resistant Rice.	2016	J Genet Genomics	Over the last decades, much endeavor has been made to advance genome editing technology due to its promising role in both basic and synthetic biology. The breakthrough has been made in recent years with the advent of sequence-specific endonucleases, especially zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) guided nucleases (e.g., Cas9). In higher eukaryotic organisms, site-directed mutagenesis usually can be achieved through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair to the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by the exogenously applied nucleases. However, site-specific gene replacement or genuine genome editing through homologous recombination (HR) repair to DSBs remains a challenge. As a proof of concept gene replacement through TALEN-based HR in rice (Oryza sativa), we successfully produced double point mutations in rice acetolactate synthase gene (OsALS) and generated herbicide resistant rice lines by using TALENs and donor DNA carrying the desired mutations. After ballistic delivery into rice calli of TALEN construct and donor DNA, nine HR events with different genotypes of OsALS were obtained in T0 generation at the efficiency of 1.4%-6.3% from three experiments. The HR-mediated gene edits were heritable to the progeny of T1 generation. The edited T1 plants were as morphologically normal as the control plants while displayed strong herbicide resistance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of TALEN-mediated genome editing in rice and provide useful information for further genome editing by other nuclease-based genome editing platforms.
26780420	Magnaporthe oryzae-Secreted Protein MSP1 Induces Cell Death and Elicits Defense Responses in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The Magnaporthe oryzae snodprot1 homolog (MSP1), secreted by M. oryzae, is a cerato-platanin family protein. msp1-knockout mutants have reduced virulence on barley leaves, indicating that MSP1 is required for the pathogenicity of rice blast fungus. To investigate the functional roles of MSP1 and its downstream signaling in rice, recombinant MSP1 was produced in Escherichia coli and was assayed for its functionality. Application of MSP1 triggered cell death and elicited defense responses in rice. MSP1 also induced H2O2 production and autophagic cell death in both suspension-cultured cells and rice leaves. One or more protein kinases triggered cell death, jasmonic acid and abscisic acid enhanced cell death, while salicylic acid suppressed it. We demonstrated that the secretion of MSP1 into the apoplast is a prerequisite for triggering cell death and activating defense-related gene expression. Furthermore, pretreatment of rice with a sublethal MSP1 concentration potentiated resistance to the pathogen. Taken together, our results showed that MSP1 induces a high degree of cell death in plants, which might be essential for its virulence. Moreover, rice can recognize MSP1, resulting in the induction of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity.
26801057	Analysis of dynamic protein carbonylation in rice embryo during germination through AP-SWATH.	2016	Proteomics	Seed germination is an important aspect of the plant life cycle, during which, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate. The accumulation of ROS results in an increase in protein oxidation of which carbonylation is the most canonical one. However, there is insufficient information concerning protein oxidation, especially carbonylation and its contribution to seed germination. In this study, biotin hydrazide labeled chromatography combined with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) method was used to analyze the dynamic pattern of protein carbonylation in rice embryos during germination. A total of 1872 unique proteins were quantified, among which 288 carbonylated peptides corresponding to 144 proteins were determined based on the filtering through mass shifts of modified amino acids. In addition, 66 carbonylated proteins were further analyzed based on their carbonylation intensity in four stages of germination. These identified carbonylated proteins were mainly involved in maintaining the levels of ROS, abscisic acid and seed reserves. Remarkably, a peroxiredoxin was found with 23 unique carbonylated peptides, and the expression of which was consistent with its increased activity. This study describes the dynamic pattern of carbonylated proteins during seed germination, and may help to further understand the biochemical mechanisms on this process.
26932667	Monitoring the efficacy of mutated Allium sativum leaf lectin in transgenic rice against Rhizoctonia solani.	2016	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. It is associated with significant reduction in rice productivity worldwide. A mutant variant of mannose binding Allium sativum leaf agglutinin (mASAL) was previously reported to exhibit strong antifungal activity against R. solani. In this study, the mASAL gene has been evaluated for its in planta antifungal activity in rice plants.

RESULTS: mASAL was cloned into pCAMBIA1301 binary vector under the control of CaMV35S promoter. It was expressed in an elite indica rice cv. IR64 by employing Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Molecular analyses of transgenic plants confirmed the presence and stable integration of mASAL gene. Immunohistofluorescence analysis of various tissue sections of plant parts clearly indicated the constitutive expression of mASAL. The segregation pattern of mASAL transgene was observed in T1 progenies in a 3:1 Mendelian ratio. The expression of mASAL was confirmed in T0 and T1 plants through western blot analysis followed by ELISA. In planta bioassay of transgenic lines against R. solani exhibited an average of 55 % reduction in sheath blight percentage disease index (PDI).

CONCLUSIONS: The present study opens up the possibility of engineering rice plants with the antifungal gene mASAL, conferring resistance to sheath blight.
26959982	Evidence for divergence of response in Indica, Japonica, and wild rice to high CO2 × temperature interaction.	2016	Glob Chang Biol	High CO2 and high temperature have an antagonistic interaction effect on rice yield potential and present a unique challenge to adapting rice to projected future climates. Understanding how the differences in response to these two abiotic variables are partitioned across rice germplasm accessions may be key to identifying potentially useful sources of resilient alleles for adapting rice to climate change. In this study, we evaluated eleven globally diverse rice accessions under controlled conditions at two carbon dioxide concentrations (400 and 600 ppm) and four temperature environments (29 °C day/21 °C night; 29 °C day/21 °C night with additional heat stress at anthesis; 34 °C day/26 °C night; and 34 °C day/26 °C night with additional heat stress at anthesis) for a suite of traits including five yield components, five growth characteristics, one phenological trait, and four photosynthesis-related measurements. Multivariate analyses of mean trait data from these eight treatments divide our rice panel into two primary groups consistent with the genetic classification of INDICA/INDICA-like and JAPONICA populations. Overall, we find that the productivity of plants grown under elevated [CO2 ] was more sensitive (negative response) to high temperature stress compared with that of plants grown under ambient [CO2 ] across this diversity panel. We report differential response to CO2 × temperature interaction for INDICA/INDICA-like and JAPONICA rice accessions and find preliminary evidence for the beneficial introduction of exotic alleles into cultivated rice genomic background. Overall, these results support the idea of using wild or currently unadapted gene pools in rice to enhance breeding efforts to secure future climate change adaptation.
26919041	Low melatonin production by suppression of either serotonin N-acetyltransferase or N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase in rice causes seedling growth retardation with yield penalty, abiotic stress susceptibility, and enhanced coleoptile growth under anoxic conditions.	2016	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) are the last two key enzymes for melatonin biosynthesis in living organisms. In this study, we demonstrated that transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants, in which expression of either endogenous SNAT or ASMT was suppressed, had reduced melatonin synthesis, confirming that both SNAT and ASMT are functionally involved in melatonin synthesis. The melatonin-deficient SNAT rice had retarded seedling growth, which was partially restored by exogenous melatonin application, suggesting melatonin's role in seedling growth. In addition, the plants were more sensitive to various abiotic stresses, including salt and cold, compared with the wild type. Melatonin-deficient SNAT rice had increased coleoptile growth under anoxic conditions, indicating that melatonin also inversely regulates plant growth under anaerobic conditions with the concomitant high expression of alcohol dehydrogenase genes. Similarly, the melatonin-deficient ASMT rice exhibited accelerated senescence in detached flag leaves, as well as significantly reduced yield. These loss-of-function studies on the melatonin biosynthetic genes confirmed most previous pharmacological reports that melatonin not only promotes plant growth but also mitigates various abiotic stresses.
27025363	Computational identification and systematic classification of novel GRAS genes in Isatis indigotica.	2016	Chin J Nat Med	Isatis indigotica Fort., belonging to Cruciferae, is one of the most commonly used plants in traditional Chinese medicine. The accumulation of the effective components of I. indigotica is related with its growth conditions. The GRAS genes are members of a multigene family of transcriptional regulators that play a crucial role in plant growth. Although the activities of many GRAS genes have long been recognized, only in recent years were some of them identified and functionally characterized in detail. In the present study, 41 GRAS genes were identified from I. indigotica through bioinformatics methods for the first time. They were classified into ten groups according to the classification of Arabidopsis and rice. The characterization, gene structure, conserved motifs, disordered N-terminal domains, and phylogenetic reconstruction of these GRASs were analyzed. Forty-three orthologous gene pairs were shared by I. indigotica and Arabidopsis, and interaction networks of these orthologous genes were constructed. Furthermore, gene expression patterns were investigated by analysis in methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treated I. indigotica hairy roots based on RNA-seq data. In conclusion, this comprehensive analysis would provide rich resources for further studies of GRAS protein functions in this plant.
26936896	Heat stress yields a unique MADS box transcription factor in determining seed size and thermal sensitivity.	2016	Plant Physiol	Early seed development events are highly sensitive to increased temperature. This high sensitivity to a short-duration temperature spike reduces seed viability and seed size at maturity. The molecular basis of heat stress sensitivity during early seed development is not known. We selected rice (Oryza sativa), a highly heat-sensitive species, to explore this phenomenon. Here, we elucidate the molecular pathways that contribute to the heat sensitivity of a critical developmental window during which the endosperm transitions from syncytium to the cellularization stage in young seeds. A transcriptomic comparison of seeds exposed to moderate (35°C) and severe (39°C) heat stress with control (28°C) seeds identified a set of putative imprinted genes, which were down-regulated under severe heat stress. Several type I MADS box genes specifically expressed during the syncytial stage were differentially regulated under moderate and severe heat stress. The suppression and overaccumulation of these genes are associated with precocious and delayed cellularization under moderate and severe stress, respectively. We show that modulating the expression of OsMADS87, one of the heat-sensitive, imprinted genes associated with syncytial stage endosperm, regulates rice seed size. Transgenic seeds deficient in OsMADS87 exhibit accelerated endosperm cellularization. These seeds also have lower sensitivity to a moderate heat stress in terms of seed size reduction compared with seeds from wild-type plants and plants overexpressing OsMADS87 Our findings suggest that OsMADS87 and several other genes identified in this study could be potential targets for improving the thermal resilience of rice during reproductive development.
26961568	Comparing the defence-related gene expression changes upon root-knot nematode attack in susceptible versus resistant cultivars of rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice is one of the major staple food crops in the world and an excellent model system for studying monocotyledonous plants. Diseases caused by nematodes in rice are well documented and among them, root-knot nematode (RKN), Meloidogyne graminicola, causes extensive yield decline. It is therefore necessary to identify novel sources of natural resistance to RKN in rice and to investigate the rice-RKN interaction in detail to understand the basal plant defence mechanisms and nematode manipulation of the host physiology. To this end, six different cultivars of rice were initially screened for RKN infection and development; Pusa 1121 and Vandana were found to be most susceptible and resistant to RKN infection, respectively. In order to investigate the role of major hormone-regulated plant defence pathways in compatible/incompatible rice-RKN interaction, some well-identified marker genes involved in salicylate/jasmonate/ethylene pathway were evaluated for their differential expression through qRT-PCR. In general, our study shows a remarkable discrepancy in the expression pattern of those genes between compatible and incompatible rice-RKN interaction. As most information on the molecular interplay between plants and nematodes were generated on dicotyledonous plants, the current study will strengthen our basic understanding of plant-nematode interaction in the monocot crops, which will aid in defining future strategies for best plant health measures.
26995311	Manganese-induced regulations in growth, yield formation, quality characters, rice aroma and enzyme involved in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline biosynthesis in fragrant rice.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Micro-nutrient application is essential for normal plant growth while a little is known about manganese (Mn)-induced regulations in morpho-physiological attributes, aroma formation and enzyme involved in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) biosynthesis in aromatic rice. Present study aimed to examine the influence of four levels of Mn i.e., Mn1 (100 mg MnSO4 pot(-1)), Mn2 (150 mg MnSO4 pot(-1)), Mn3 (200 mg MnSO4 pot(-1)), and Mn4 (250 mg MnSO4 pot(-1)) on the growth, yield formation, quality characters, rice aroma and enzyme involved in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline biosynthesis in two fragrant rice cultivars i.e., Meixiangzhan and Nongxiang 18. Pots without Mn application were served as control (Ck). Each pot contained 15 kg of soil. Effects on agronomic characters, quality attributes, 2-AP contents and enzymes involved in 2-AP biosynthesis have been studied in early and late season rice. Results depicted that Mn improved rice growth, yield and related characters, and some quality attributes significantly. It further up-regulated proline, pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) (precursors of 2-AP), soluble proteins and activities of proline dehydrogenase (ProDH), Δ(1) pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS) ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) that led to enhanced 2-AP production in rice grains. Moreover, higher Mn levels resulted in increased grain Mn contents in both rice cultivars. Along with growth and yield improvement, Mn application significantly improved rice aromatic contents. Overall, Nongxiang 18 accumulated more 2-AP contents than Meixiangzhan in both seasons under Mn application. This study further explored the importance of Mn in rice aroma formation and signifies that micro-nutrients can play significant roles in rice aroma synthesis; however, intensive studies at molecular levels are still needed to understand the exact mechanisms of Mn to improve rice aroma formation.
27017220	Transgenic rice expressing the cry2AX1 gene confers resistance to multiple lepidopteran pests.	2016	Transgenic Res	A chimeric Bacillus thuringiensis toxin (Bt) gene, cry2AX1was cloned in a bi-selectable marker free binary vector construct. The cry2AX1 gene, driven by the Chrysanthemum rbcS1 promoter, was introduced into JK1044R, the restorer line (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica) of a notified commercially grown rice hybrid in India, by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Its effect against two major lepidopteran insect pests viz., yellow stem borer (YSB) Scirpophaga incertulas, rice leaf folder (RLF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and one minor insect pest, oriental army worm (OAW) Mythimna separata was demonstrated through bioassays of transgenic rice plants under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. The rbcS1 promoter with chloroplast signal peptide was used to avoid Cry2AX1 protein expression in rice seed endosperm tissue. A total of 37 independent transformants were generated, of which after preliminary molecular characterization and YSB bioassay screening, five events were selected for their protein expression and bioefficacy against all three rice insect. One elite transgenic rice line, BtE15, was identified with Cry2AX1 expression ranging from 0.68 to 1.34 µg g(-1) leaf fresh weight and with 80-92 % levels of resistance against rice pests at the vegetative and reproductive stages. Increase in Cry2AX1 protein concentration was also observed with crop maturity. The Cry2AX1protein concentration in the de-husked seeds was negligible (as low as 2.7-3.6 ng g(-1)). These results indicate the potential application of cry2AX1 gene in rice for protection against YSB, RLF and OAW.
27038670	AmyI-1-18, a cationic α-helical antimicrobial octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase in rice, inhibits the translation and folding processes in a protein synthesis system.	2016	J Biosci Bioeng	In our previous study, we used a cell-free rapid translation system (RTS), which is an in vitro protein synthesis system based on Escherichia coli lysate, for evaluating the inhibition of green fluorescent protein (GFP) synthesis by pyrrhocoricin. In this study, using an RTS, we evaluated the inhibition of GFP synthesis by AmyI-1-18, an antimicrobial octadecapeptide. We found that, similarly to pyrrhocoricin, AmyI-1-18 inhibited GFP synthesis in the RTS in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the blockage of transcription and translation steps in the RTS was individually estimated using RT-PCR after gene expression to determine the mRNA products and using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the amounts of GFP expressed from purified mRNA, respectively. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of GFP synthesis by AmyI-1-18 did not occur at the transcription step but rather at the translation step. Furthermore, we assessed the inhibition of DnaK-mediated refolding of chemically denatured luciferase by AmyI-1-18; AmyI-1-18 inhibited the protein folding activity of the ATP-dependent DnaK/DnaJ molecular chaperone system in a concentration-dependent manner. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that AmyI-1-18 strongly bound to RNA with a KD value of 1.4 × 10(-8) M but not to DNA and that AmyI-1-18 specifically bound to DnaK with a KD value of 4.4 × 10(-6) M. These SPR analysis results supported the results obtained in both the RTS and the molecular chaperone system. These results demonstrated that both RNA and DnaK are most likely the target of AmyI-1-18 in the protein synthesis system.
26945855	The polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 4 (OsPGIP4), a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus, confers resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: OsPGIP4 overexpression enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice. Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins are thought to play important roles in the innate immunity of rice against fungi. Here, we show that the chromosomal location of OsPGIP4 coincides with the major bacterial leaf streak resistance quantitative trait locus qBlsr5a on the short arm of chromosome 5. OsPGIP4 expression was up-regulated upon inoculation with the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain RS105. OsPGIP4 overexpression enhanced the resistance of the susceptible rice variety Zhonghua 11 to RS105. In contrast, repressing OsPGIP4 expression resulted in an increase in disease lesions caused by RS105 in Zhonghua 11 and in Acc8558, a qBlsr5a resistance donor. More interestingly, upon inoculation, the activated expression of pathogenesis-related genes was attenuated for those genes involved in the salicylic acid pathway, while the activated expression of jasmonic acid pathway markers was increased in the overexpression lines. Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice.
26810451	Specific roles of tocopherols and tocotrienols in seed longevity and germination tolerance to abiotic stress in transgenic rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Tocopherols and tocotrienols are lipophilic antioxidants that are abundant in plant seeds. Although their roles have been extensively studied, our understanding of their functions in rice seeds is still limited. In this study, on the basis of available RNAi rice plants constitutively silenced for homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT) and tocopherol cyclase (TC), we developed transgenic plants that silenced homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT). All the RNAi plants showed significantly reduced germination percentages and a higher proportion of abnormal seedlings than the control plants, with HGGT transgenics showing the most severe phenotype. The accelerated aging phenotype corresponded well with the amount of H2O2 accumulated in the embryo, glucose level, and ion leakage, but not with the amount of O(2-) accumulated in the embryo and lipid hydroperoxides levels in these genotypes. Under abiotic stress conditions, HPT and TC transgenics showed lower germination percentage and seedling growth than HGGT transgenics, while HGGT transgenics showed almost the same status as the wild type. Therefore, we proposed that tocopherols in the germ may protect the embryo from reactive oxygen species under both accelerated aging and stress conditions, whereas tocotrienols in the pericarp may exclusively help in reducing the metabolic activity of the seed during accelerated aging.
26994840	Comparison of susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis and Bombyx mori to five Bacillus thuringiensis proteins.	2016	J Invertebr Pathol	Transformation of rice with genes encoding insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) should confer high resistance to target lepidopteran pests, such as Chilo suppressalis, and low toxicity to non-target organisms, such as silkworm Bombyx mori. Five purified Cry proteins that have been used for plant transformation were tested using dietary exposure assays. The susceptibility of C. suppressalis larvae to the five insecticidal proteins in the decreasing order was: Cry1Ca>Cry1Ab>Cry1Ac>Cry2Aa>Cry1Fa. However, the toxicities of the Cry proteins to B. mori were in the order: Cry1Fa>Cry1Ca>Cry2Aa>Cry1Ab>Cry1Ac. The Cry1Ca, Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac proteins exhibited relatively high toxicity to C. suppressalis larvae, with EC50 values of 16.4, 45.8 and 89.6ng/g, respectively. The toxicities of the three Cry proteins to B. mori larvae were 8, 14, and 22times lower, with EC50 values of 138.3, 628.4 and 1939.2ng/g, respectively. The Cry1Fa and Cry2Aa proteins showed high toxicity to B. mori larvae, with EC50 values of 135.7 and 373.9ng/g, respectively, but low toxicity to C. suppressalis larvae, with EC50 values of 6092.1 and 1208.5ng/g, respectively. We thus conclude that Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca are appropriate for transforming rice to control lepidopteran rice pests. In contrast, Cry1Fa and Cry2Aa are not appropriate due to their high toxicity to silkworm larvae and low activity against the target pest.
26940571	Reliable Selection and Holistic Stability Evaluation of Reference Genes for Rice Under 22 Different Experimental Conditions.	2016	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Stable and uniform expression of reference genes across samples plays a key role in accurate normalization of gene expression by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For rice study, there is still a lack of validation and recommendation of appropriate reference genes with high stability depending on experimental conditions. Eleven candidate reference genes potentially owning high stability were evaluated by geNorm and NormFinder for their expression stability in 22 various experimental conditions. Best combinations of multiple reference genes were recommended depending on experimental conditions, and the holistic stability of reference genes was also evaluated. Reference genes would become more variable and thus needed to be critically selected in experimental groups of tissues, heat, 6-benzylamino purine, and drought, but they were comparatively stable under cold, wound, and ultraviolet-B stresses. Triosephosphate isomerase (TI), profilin-2 (Profilin-2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC), endothelial differentiation factor (Edf), and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) were stable in most of our experimental conditions. No universal reference gene showed good stability in all experimental conditions. To get accurate expression result, suitable combination of multiple reference genes for a specific experimental condition would be a better choice. This study provided an application guideline to select stable reference genes for rice gene expression study.
26970512	Ectopic expression of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene PtCYP714A3 from Populus trichocarpa reduces shoot growth and improves tolerance to salt stress in transgenic rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	In Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 714 protein family represents a unique group of CYP monooxygenase, which functions as a shoot-specific regulator in plant development through gibberellin deactivation. Here, we report the functional characterizations of PtCYP714A3, an OsCYP714D1/Eui homologue from Populus trichocarpa. PtCYP714A3 was ubiquitously expressed with the highest transcript level in cambium-phloem tissues, and was greatly induced by salt and osmotic stress in poplar. Subcellular localization analyses indicated that PtCYP714A3-YFP fusion protein was targeted to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of PtCYP714A3 in the rice eui mutant could rescue its excessive-shoot-growth phenotype. Ectopic expression of PtCYP714A3 in rice led to semi-dwarfed phenotype with promoted tillering and reduced seed size. Transgenic lines which showed significant expression of PtCYP714A3 also accumulated lower GA level than did the wild-type (WT) plants. The expression of some GA biosynthesis genes was significantly suppressed in these transgenic plants. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt and maintained more Na(+) in both shoot and root tissues under salinity stress. All these results not only suggest a crucial role of PtCYP714A3 in shoot responses to salt toxicity in rice, but also provide a molecular basis for genetic engineering of salt-tolerant crops.
26833589	Somaclonal variation does not preclude the use of rice transformants for genetic screening.	2016	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the world's most important crops. Rice researchers make extensive use of insertional mutants for the study of gene function. Approximately half a million flanking sequence tags from rice insertional mutant libraries are publicly available. However, the relationship between genotype and phenotype is very weak. Transgenic plant assays have been used frequently for complementation, overexpression or antisense analysis, but sequence changes caused by callus growth, Agrobacterium incubation medium, virulence genes, transformation and selection conditions are unknown. We used high-throughput sequencing of DNA from rice lines derived from Tainung 67 to analyze non-transformed and transgenic rice plants for mutations caused by these parameters. For comparison, we also analyzed sequence changes for two additional rice varieties and four T-DNA tagged transformants from the Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutant resource. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms, small indels, large deletions, chromosome doubling and chromosome translocations in these lines. Using standard rice regeneration/transformation procedures, the mutation rates of regenerants and transformants were relatively low, with no significant differences among eight tested treatments in the Tainung 67 background and in the cultivars Taikeng 9 and IR64. Thus, we could not conclusively detect sequence changes resulting from Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in addition to those caused by tissue culture-induced somaclonal variation. However, the mutation frequencies within the two publically available tagged mutant populations, including TRIM transformants or Tos17 lines, were about 10-fold higher than the frequency of standard transformants, probably because mass production of embryogenic calli and longer callus growth periods were required to generate these large libraries.
26993329	Pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP) regulates carbon metabolism during grain filling in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Decreased PFPase activity in rice perturbs the equilibration of carbon metabolism during grain filling but has no visible phenotypic effects during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Starch is a primary energy reserve for various metabolic processes in plant. Despite much advance has been achieved in pathways involved in starch biosynthesis, information was still lacked for precise regulation related to carbon metabolism during seed filling in rice (Oryza sativa). The objective of this study was to identify and characterize new gene associated with carbon metabolism during grain filling. By screening our chemical mutant pool, two allelic mutants exhibiting floury endosperm were isolated. No visible phenotypic defects were observed during both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages, except for the floury-like endosperm of grains with significantly reduced kernel thickness, 1000-grain weight and total starch content. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were controlled by a gene encoding pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP, EC 2.7.1.90) β subunit (PFPβ), which catalyzes reversible interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate. The identity of PFP β was further confirmed by a genetic complementation test. Subcellular analysis demonstrated that PFPβ was localized in cytoplasm. Quantitative PCR and histochemical staining indicated PFP β was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Furthermore, we found PFP β could express in both the early and late phases of starch accumulation during grain filling and decreased activity of PFP β in pfp mutants resulted in compromised carbon metabolism with increased soluble sugar contents and unfavorable starch biosynthesis. Our results highlight PFPβ functions in modulating carbon metabolism during grain filling stage.
27162494	BrUGE1 transgenic rice showed improved growth performance with enhanced drought tolerance.	2016	Breed Sci	UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (UGE) catalyzes the reversible conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. To understand the biological function of UGE from Brassica rapa, the gene BrUGE1 was cloned and introduced into the genome of wild type rice 'Gopum' using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. Four lines which carried a single copy gene were selected and forwarded to T3 generation. Agronomic traits evaluation of the transgenic T3 lines (CB01, CB03, and CB06) under optimal field conditions revealed enriched biomass production particularly in panicle length, number of productive tillers, number of spikelets per panicle, and filled spikelets. These remarkably improved agronomic traits were ascribed to a higher photosynthetic rate complemented with higher CO2 assimilation. Transcripts of BrUGE1 in transgenic lines continuously accumulated at higher levels after the 20% PEG6000 treatment, implying its probable role in drought stress regulation. This was paralleled by rapid accumulation of soluble sugars which act as osmoprotectants, leading to delayed leaf rolling and drying. Our findings suggest the potential of BrUGE1 in improving rice growth performance under optimal and water deficit conditions.
27005412	Melatonin production in Escherichia coli by dual expression of serotonin N-acetyltransferase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase.	2016	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Melatonin is a well-known bioactive molecule produced in animals and plants and a well-studied natural compound. Two enzymatic steps are required for the biosynthesis of melatonin from serotonin. First, serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) catalyzes serotonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS) followed by the action of N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), resulting in the synthesis of O-methylated NAS, also known as melatonin. Attempts to document melatonin production in Escherichia coli have been unsuccessful to date due to either low enzyme activity or inactive ASMT expression. Here, we employed caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) instead of ASMT, as COMT is a multifunctional enzyme that has ASMT activity as well. Among several combinations of dual expression cassettes, recombinant E. coli that expressed sheep SNAT with rice COMT produced a high quantity of melatonin, which was measured in a culture medium (1.46 mg/L in response to 1 mM serotonin). This level was several orders of magnitude higher than that produced in transgenic rice and tomato overexpressing sheep SNAT and ASMT, respectively. This heterologous expression system can be widely employed to screen various putative SNAT or ASMT genes from animals and plants as well as to overproduce melatonin in various useful microorganisms.
26970777	Prediction and identification of the effectors of heterotrimeric G proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Brief Bioinform	Heterotrimeric G protein signaling cascades are one of the primary metazoan sensing mechanisms linking a cell to environment. However, the number of experimentally identified effectors of G protein in plant is limited. We have therefore studied which tools are best suited for predicting G protein effectors in rice. Here, we compared the predicting performance of four classifiers with eight different encoding schemes on the effectors of G proteins by using 10-fold cross-validation. Four methods were evaluated: random forest, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors and support vector machine. We applied these methods to experimentally identified effectors of G proteins and randomly selected non-effector proteins, and tested their sensitivity and speciﬁcity. The result showed that random forest classifier with composition of K-spaced amino acid pairs and composition of motif or domain (CKSAAP_PROSITE_200) combination method yielded the best performance, with accuracy and the Mathew's correlation coefficient reaching 74.62% and 0.49, respectively. We have developed G-Effector, an online predictor, which outperforms BLAST, PSI-BLAST and HMMER on predicting the effectors of G proteins. This provided valuable guidance for the researchers to select classifiers combined with different feature selection encoding schemes. We used G-Effector to screen the effectors of G protein in rice, and confirmed the candidate effectors by gene co-expression data. Interestingly, one of the top 15 candidates, which did not appear in the training data set, was validated in a previous research work. Therefore, the candidate effectors list in this article provides both a clue for researchers as to their function and a framework of validation for future experimental work. It is accessible at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/geffector.
26862573	Data set from a comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis of rice variety IRBB5 in response to bacterial blight.	2016	Data Brief	Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) has become one of the most devastating diseases for rice, a major food source for over half of the world populations. To investigate the roles of protein phosphorylation in rice bacterial blight resistance, a quantitative phosphoproteomic study was conducted in rice variety IRBB5 at 0 h and 24 h after Xoo infection. 2367 and 2223 phosphosites on 1334 and 1297 representative proteins were identified in 0 h and 24 h after Xoo infection, respectively, out of which 762 proteins were found to be differentially phosphorylated. In associated with the published article "A comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of rice in response to bacterial blight" in BMC Plant Biology (Hou et al., 2015) [1], this dataset article provided the detailed information of experimental designing, methods, features as well as the raw data of mass spectrometry (MS) identification. The MS proteomics data could be fully accessed from the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD002222.
27035683	Proteomics analysis reveals distinct involvement of embryo and endosperm proteins during seed germination in dormant and non-dormant rice seeds.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Seed germination is a complex trait which is influenced by many genetic, endogenous and environmental factors, but the key event(s) associated with seed germination are still poorly understood. In present study, the non-dormant cultivated rice Yannong S and the dormant Dongxiang wild rice seeds were used as experimental materials, we comparatively investigated the water uptake, germination time course, and the differential proteome of the effect of embryo and endosperm on germination of these two types of seeds. A total of 231 and 180 protein spots in embryo and endosperm, respectively, showed a significant change in abundance during germination. We observed that the important proteins associated with seed germination included those involved in metabolism, energy production, protein synthesis and destination, storage protein, cell growth and division, signal transduction, cell defense and rescue. The contribution of embryo and endosperm to seed germination is different. In embryo, the proteins involved in amino acid activation, sucrose cleavage, glycolysis, fermentation and protein synthesis increased; in endosperm, the proteins involved in sucrose cleavage and glycolysis decreased, and those with ATP and CoQ synthesis and proteolysis increased. Our results provide some new knowledge to understand further the mechanism of seed germination.
27025496	The impact and origin of copy number variations in the Oryza species.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV), a complex genomic rearrangement, has been extensively studied in humans and other organisms. In plants, CNVs of several genes were found to be responsible for various important traits; however, the cause and consequence of CNVs remains largely unknown. Recently released next-generation sequencing (NGS) data provide an opportunity for a genome-wide study of CNVs in rice.

RESULTS: Here, by an NGS-based approach, we generated a CNV map comprising 9,196 deletions compared to the reference genome 'Nipponbare'. Using Oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80% of the CNV events turned out to be insertions in Nipponbare. There were 2,806 annotated genes affected by these CNV events. We experimentally validated 28 functional CNV genes including OsMADS56, BPH14, OsDCL2b and OsMADS30, implying that CNVs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice. Most CNV genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to O. glaberrima. One of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair. Comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of CNVs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.

CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.
27093133	Genome-wide DNA polymorphisms in Kavuni, a traditional rice cultivar with nutritional and therapeutic properties.	2016	Genome	Although rice genome was sequenced in the year 2002, efforts in resequencing the large number of available accessions, landraces, traditional cultivars, and improved varieties of this important food crop are limited. We have initiated resequencing of the traditional cultivars from India. Kavuni is an important traditional rice cultivar from South India that attracts premium price for its nutritional and therapeutic properties. Whole-genome sequencing of Kavuni using Illumina platform and SNPs analysis using Nipponbare reference genome identified 1 150 711 SNPs of which 377 381 SNPs were located in the genic regions. Non-synonymous SNPs (62 708) were distributed in 19 251 genes, and their number varied between 1 and 115 per gene. Large-effect DNA polymorphisms (7769) were present in 3475 genes. Pathway mapping of these polymorphisms revealed the involvement of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, translation, protein-folding, and cell death. Analysis of the starch biosynthesis related genes revealed that the granule-bound starch synthase I gene had T/G SNPs at the first intron/exon junction and a two-nucleotide combination, which were reported to favour high amylose content and low glycemic index. The present study provided a valuable genomics resource to study the rice varieties with nutritional and medicinal properties.
27000868	Glycerolipidome responses to freezing- and chilling-induced injuries: examples in Arabidopsis and rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Glycerolipids are the principal constituent of cellular membranes; remodelling of glycerolipids plays important roles in temperature adaptation in plants. Temperate plants can endure freezing stress, but even chilling at above-zero temperatures can induce death in tropical species. However, little is known about the differences in glycerolipid response to low temperatures between chilling-sensitive and freezing-tolerant plants. Using ESI-MS/MS-based lipidomic analysis, we compared the glycerolipidome of chilling (4 and 10 °C)-treated rice with that of freezing (-6 and -12 °C)-treated Arabidopsis, both immediately after these low-temperature treatments and after a subsequent recovery culture period.

RESULTS: Arabidopsis is a 16:3 plant that harbours both eukaryotic and prokaryotic-type lipid synthesis pathways, while rice is an 18:3 plant that harbours only the eukaryotic lipid synthesis pathway. Arabidopsis contains higher levels of galactolipids than rice and has a higher double bond index (DBI). Arabidopsis contains lower levels of high melting point phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecules and has a lower average acyl chain length (ACL). Marked phospholipid degradation occurred during the recovery culture period of non-lethal chilling treated rice, but did not occur in non-lethal freezing treated Arabidopsis. Glycerolipids with larger head groups were synthesized more in Arabidopsis than in rice at sub-lethal low-temperatures. Levels of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) rose in both plants after low-temperature treatment. The DBI and ACL of total lipids did not change during low-temperature treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: A higher DBI and a lower ACL could make the membranes of Arabidopsis more fluid at low temperatures. The ability to synthesize glycerolipids containing a larger head group may correlate with low-temperature tolerance. The low-temperature-induced increase of PA may play a dual role in plant responses to low temperatures: as a lipid signal that initiates tolerance responses, and as a structural molecule that, on extensive in large accumulation, could damage the integrity of membranes. Changes in ACL and DBI are responses of plants to long-term low temperature.
26906115	ATP binding cassette G transporters and plant male reproduction.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	The function of ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) transporters in the regulation of plant vegetative organs development has been well characterized in various plant species. In contrast, their function in reproductive development particularly male reproductive development received considerably less attention till some ABCG transporters was reported to be associated with anther and pollen wall development in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) during the past decade. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of ABCG transporters regarding to their roles in male reproduction and underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms, which makes it evident that ABCG transporters represent one of those conserved and divergent components closely related to male reproduction in plants. This mini-review also discusses the current challenges and future perspectives in this particular field.
26946285	Interaction between sulfur and lead in toxicity, iron plaque formation and lead accumulation in rice plant.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Human activities have resulted in lead and sulfur accumulation in paddy soils in parts of southern China. A combined soil-sand pot experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of S supply on iron plaque formation and Pb accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under two Pb levels (0 and 600 mg kg(-1)), combined with four S concentrations (0, 30, 60, and 120 mg kg(-1)). Results showed that S supply significantly decreased Pb accumulation in straw and grains of rice. This result may be attributed to the enhancement of Fe plaque formation, decrease of Pb availability in soil, and increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) in rice leaves. Moderate S supply (30 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased Fe plaque formation on the root surface and in the rhizosphere, whereas excessive S supply (60 and 120 mg kg(-1)) significantly decreased the amounts of iron plaque on the root surface. Sulfur supply significantly enhanced the GSH contents in leaves of rice plants under Pb treatment. With excessive S application, the rice root acted as a more effective barrier to Pb accumulation compared with iron plaque. Excessive S supply may result in a higher monosulfide toxicity and decreased iron plaque formation on the root surface during flooded conditions. However, excessive S supply could effectively decrease Pb availability in soils and reduce Pb accumulation in rice plants.
27162502	Variation in cooking and eating quality traits in Japanese rice germplasm accessions.	2016	Breed Sci	The eating quality of cooked rice is important and determines its market price and consumer acceptance. To comprehensively describe the variation of eating quality in 183 rice germplasm accessions, we evaluated 33 eating-quality traits including amylose and protein contents, pasting properties of rice flour, and texture of cooked rice grains. All eating-quality traits varied widely in the germplasm accessions. Principal-components analysis (PCA) revealed that allelic differences in the Wx gene explained the largest proportion of phenotypic variation of the eating-quality traits. In 146 accessions of non-glutinous temperate japonica rice, PCA revealed that protein content and surface texture of the cooked rice grains significantly explained phenotypic variations of the eating-quality traits. An allelic difference based on simple sequence repeats, which was located near a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 3, was associated with differences in the eating quality of non-glutinous temperate japonica rice. These results suggest that eating quality is controlled by genetic factors, including the Wx gene and the QTL on chromosome 3, in Japanese rice accessions. These genetic factors have been consciously selected for eating quality during rice breeding programs in Japan.
26973288	Decoding regulatory landscape of somatic embryogenesis reveals differential regulatory networks between japonica and indica rice subspecies.	2016	Sci Rep	Somatic embryogenesis is a unique process in plants and has considerable interest for biotechnological application. Compare to japonica, indica rice has been less responsive to in vitro culture. We used Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing platform for comparative transcriptome analysis between two rice subspecies at six different developmental stages combined with a tag-based digital gene expression profiling. Global gene expression among different samples showed greater complexity in japonica rice compared to indica which may be due to polyphyletic origin of two rice subspecies. Expression pattern in initial stage indicate major differences in proembryogenic callus induction phase that may serve as key regulator to observe differences between both subspecies. Our data suggests that phytohormone signaling pathways consist of elaborate networks with frequent crosstalk, thereby allowing plants to regulate somatic embryogenesis pathway. However, this crosstalk varies between the two rice subspecies. Down regulation of positive regulators of meristem development (i.e. KNOX, OsARF5) and up regulation of its counterparts (OsRRs, MYB, GA20ox1/GA3ox2) in japonica may be responsible for its better regeneration and differentiation of somatic embryos. Comprehensive gene expression information in the present experiment may also facilitate to understand the monocot specific meristem regulation for dedifferentiation of somatic cell to embryogenic cells.
27025598	Association of SNP Haplotypes of HKT Family Genes with Salt Tolerance in Indian Wild Rice Germplasm.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the most important crops for global food security but its productivity is adversely affected by salt stress prevalent in about 30 % of the cultivated land. For developing salt-tolerant rice varieties through conventional breeding or biotechnological interventions, there is an urgent need to identify natural allelic variants that may confer salt tolerance. Here, 299 wild rice accessions collected from different agro-climatic regions of India were evaluated during growth under salt stress. Of these 95 representative accessions were sequenced for members of HKT ion transporter family genes by employing Ion Torrent PGM sequencing platform.

RESULTS: Haplotype analysis revealed haplotypes H5 and H1 of HKT1;5 and HKT2;3, respectively associated with high salinity tolerance. This is the first study of allele mining of eight members of HKT gene family from Indian wild rice reporting a salt tolerant allele of HKT2;3. HKT1;5 also showed a salt tolerant allele from wild rice. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences showed different grouping of the HKT family genes as compared to the prevailing protein sequence based classification.

CONCLUSIONS: The salt tolerant alleles of the HKT genes from wild rice may be introgressed into modern high yielding cultivars to widen the existing gene pool and enhance rice production in the salt affected areas.
26995314	A combined application of biochar and phosphorus alleviates heat-induced adversities on physiological, agronomical and quality attributes of rice.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Present study examined the influence of high-temperature stress and different biochar and phosphorus (P) fertilization treatments on the growth, grain yield and quality of two rice cultivars (IR-64 and Huanghuazhan). Plants were subjected to high day temperature-HDT (35 °C ± 2), high night temperature-HNT (32 °C ± 2), and control temperature-CT (28 °C ± 2) in controlled growth chambers. The different fertilization treatments were control, biochar alone, phosphorous (P) alone and biochar + P. High-temperature stress severely reduced the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and increased the leaf water potential of both rice cultivars. Grain yield and its related attributes except for number of panicles, were reduced under high temperature. The HDT posed more negative effects on rice physiological attributes, while HNT was more destructive for grain yield. High temperature stress also hampered the grain appearance and milling quality traits in both rice cultivars. The Huanghuazhan performed better than IR-64 under high-temperature stress with better growth and higher grain yield. Different soil fertilization treatments were helpful in ameliorating the detrimental effects of high temperature. Addition of biochar alone improved some growth and yield parameters but such positive effects were lower when compared with the combined application of biochar and P. The biochar+P application recorded 7% higher grain yield (plant(-1)) of rice compared with control averaged across different temperature treatments and cultivars. The highest grain production and better grain quality in biochar+P treatments might be due to enhanced photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and grain size, which compensated the adversities of high temperature stress.
26836501	A comprehensive catalog of the lysine-acetylation targets in rice (Oryza sativa) based on proteomic analyses.	2016	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Lysine acetylation is a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification that plays an important role in the gene transcription regulation. Here, we report high quality proteome-scale data for lysine-acetylation (Kac) sites and Kac proteins in rice (Oryza sativa). A total of 1337 Kac sites in 716 Kac proteins with diverse biological functions and subcellular localizations were identified in rice seedlings. About 42% of the sites were predicted to be localized in the chloroplast. Seven putative acetylation motifs were detected. Phenylalanine, located in both the upstream and downstream of the Kac sites, is the most conserved amino acid surrounding the regions. In addition, protein interaction network analysis revealed that a variety of signaling pathways are modulated by protein acetylation. KEGG pathway category enrichment analysis indicated that glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, carbon metabolism, and photosynthesis pathways are significantly enriched. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the acetylome in rice seedlings, and the method described here will facilitate the systematic study of how Kac functions in growth, development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses in rice and other plants.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rice is one of the most important crops consumption and is a model monocot for research. In this study, we combined a highly sensitive immune-affinity purification method (used pan anti-acetyl-lysine antibody conjugated agarose for immunoaffinity acetylated peptide enrichment) with high-resolution LC-MS/MS. In total, we identified 1337 Kac sites on 716 Kac proteins in rice cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the acetylome revealed that the acetylated proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions and have diverse subcellular localizations. We also identified seven putative acetylation motifs in the acetylated proteins of rice. In addition, protein interaction network analysis revealed that a variety of signaling pathways were modulated by protein acetylation. KEGG pathway category enrichment analysis indicated that glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, carbon metabolism, and photosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched. To our knowledge, the number of Kac sites we identified was 23-times greater and the number of Kac proteins was 16-times greater than in a previous report. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the acetylome in rice seedlings, and the method described here will facilitate the systematic study of how Kac functions in growth, development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in rice or other plants.
26900141	Association-Dissociation of Glycolate Oxidase with Catalase in Rice: A Potential Switch to Modulate Intracellular H2O2 Levels.	2016	Mol Plant	Rapid and dynamic change in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels can serve as an important signal to regulate various biological processes in plants. The change is realized by tilting the balance between its production and scavenging rates, in which membrane-associated NADPH oxidases are known to play a crucial role. Functioning independently from NADPH oxidases, glycolate oxidase (GLO) was recently demonstrated as an alternative source for H2O2 production during both gene-for-gene and non-host resistance in plants. In this study, we show that GLO physically interacts with catalase (CAT) in rice leaves, and that the interaction can be deregulated by salicylic acid (SA). Furthermore, the GLO-mediated H2O2 accumulation is synergistically enhanced by SA. Based on the well-known mechanism of substrate channeling in enzyme complexes, SA-induced H2O2 accumulation likely results from SA-induced GLO-CAT dissociation. In the GLO-CAT complex, GLO-mediated H2O2 production during photorespiration is very high, whereas the affinity of CAT for H2O2 (measured Km ≈ 43 mM) is extraordinarily low. This unique combination can further potentiate the increase in H2O2 when GLO is dissociated from CAT. Taken together, we propose that the physical association-dissociation of GLO and CAT, in response to environmental stress or stimuli, seems to serve as a specific mechanism to modulate H2O2 levels in rice.
26879398	Application of a novel phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase (RePAT) gene in developing glufosinate-resistant rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Currently, only few glufosinate-resistant genes are available for commercial application. Thus, developing novel glufosinate-resistant genes with commercial feasibility is extremely important and urgent for agricultural production. In this study, we transferred a newly isolated RePAT gene into a japonica rice variety Zhonghua11, resulting in a large number of independent T0 transgenic plants, most of which grew normally under high-concentration glufosinate treatment. Four transgenic plants with one intact RePAT expression cassette integrated into the intergenic region were selected. Agronomic performances of their T2 progenies were investigated, and the results suggested that the expression of RePAT had no adverse effect on the agronomic performance. Definite glufosinate resistance of the selected transgenic plants was further confirmed to be related to the expression of RePAT by assay on the medium and qRT-PCR. The inheritance and expression of RePAT in two transgenic plants were confirmed to be stable. Finally, the two-year field assay of glufosinate resistance suggested that the agronomic performance of the transgenic plant (PAT11) was not affected by high dosage of glufosinate (5000 g/ha). Collectively, our study proves the high resistance of a novel gene RePAT to glufosinate and provides a glufosiante-resistant rice variety with agricultural application potential.
26922174	Association mapping and genetic dissection of nitrogen use efficiency-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	The increases in the usage of nitrogen fertilizer result in deleterious impacts on the environment; thus, there is an urgent need to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in crops including rice (Oryza sativa L.). Attentions have focused on quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of NUE-related traits using single experimental population, but to date, very few studies have taken advantage of association mapping to examine hundreds of lines for identifying potentially novel QTLs in rice. Here, we conducted association analysis on NUE-related traits using a population containing 184 varieties, which were genotyped with 157 genome-wide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. We detected eight statistically significant marker loci associating with NUE-related traits, of which two QTLs at RM5639 and RM3628 harbored known NUE-related genes GS1;2 and AspAt3, respectively. At a novel NUE-related locus RM5748, we developed Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and searched for putative NUE-related genes which are close to the associated SNP marker. Based on a transcriptional map of N stress responses constructed by our lab, we evaluated expressions of the NUE-related genes in this region and validated their effect on NUE. Meanwhile, we analyzed NUE-related alleles of the eight loci that could be utilized in marker-assisted selection. Moreover, we estimated breeding values of all the varieties through genomic prediction approach that could be beneficial for rice NUE enhancement.
26869021	Expansion and stress responses of AP2/EREBP superfamily in Brachypodium distachyon.	2016	Sci Rep	APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AP2/EREBP) transcription factors constitute one of the largest and most conserved gene families in plant, and play essential roles in growth, development and stress response. Except a few members, the AP2/EREBP family has not been characterized in Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant of Poaceae. We performed a genome-wide study of this family in B. distachyon by phylogenetic analyses, transactivation assays and transcript profiling. A total of 149 AP2/EREBP genes were identified and divided into four subfamilies, i.e., ERF (ethylene responsive factor), DREB (dehydration responsive element binding gene), RAV (related to ABI3/VP) and AP2. Tandem duplication was a major force in expanding B. distachyon AP2/EREBP (BdAP2/EREBP) family. Despite a significant expansion, genomic organizations of BdAP2/EREBPs were monotonous as the majority of them, except those of AP2 subfamily, had no intron. An analysis of transcription activities of several closely related and duplicated BdDREB genes showed their functional divergence and redundancy in evolution. The expression of BdAP2/EREBPs in different tissues and the expression of DREB/ERF subfamilies in B. distachyon, wheat and rice under abiotic stresses were investigated by next-generation sequencing and microarray profiling. Our results are valuable for further function analysis of stress tolerant AP2/EREBP genes in B. distachyon.
26907259	Transcriptome-Based Identification of Differently Expressed Genes from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Strains Exhibiting Different Virulence in Rice Varieties.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight (BB) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we investigated the genome-wide transcription patterns of two Xoo strains (KACC10331 and HB1009), which showed different virulence patterns against eight rice cultivars, including IRBB21 (carrying Xa21). In total, 743 genes showed a significant change (p-value < 0.001 in t-tests) in their mRNA expression levels in the HB1009 (K3a race) strain compared with the Xoo KACC10331 strain (K1 race). Among them, four remarkably enriched GO terms, DNA binding, transposition, cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, and cellular macromolecule metabolic process, were identified in the upregulated genes. In addition, the expression of 44 genes was considerably higher (log2 fold changes > 2) in the HB1009 (K3a race) strain than in the Xoo KACC10331 (K1 race) strain. Furthermore, 13 and 12 genes involved in hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) and two-component regulatory systems (TCSs), respectively, were upregulated in the HB1009 (K3a race) strain compared with the Xoo KACC10331 (K1 race) strain, which we determined using either quantitative real-time PCR analysis or next-generation RNA sequencing. These results will be helpful to improve our understanding of Xoo and to gain a better insight into the Xoo-rice interactions.
26892000	Metabolic and transcriptomic changes induced in host during hypersensitive response mediated resistance in rice against the Asian rice gall midge.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: An incompatible interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and the Asian rice gall midge (AGM, Orseolia oryzae Wood-Mason), that is usually manifested through a hypersensitive response (HR), represents an intricate relationship between the resistant host and its avirulent pest. We investigated changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of the host (indica rice variety: RP2068-18-3-5, RP), showing HR when attacked by an avirulent gall midge biotype (GMB1), to deduce molecular and biochemical bases of such a complex interaction. Till now, such an integrated analysis of host transcriptome and metabolome has not been reported for any rice-insect interaction.

RESULTS: Transcript and metabolic profiling data revealed more than 7000 differentially expressed genes and 80 differentially accumulated metabolites, respectively, in the resistant host. Microarray data revealed deregulation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism causing a C/N shift; up-regulation of tetrapyrrole synthesis and down-regulation of chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis. Integrated results revealed that genes involved in lipid peroxidation (LPO) were up-regulated and a marker metabolite for LPO (azelaic acid) accumulated during HR. This coincided with a greater accumulation of GABA (neurotransmitter and an insect antifeedant) at the feeding site. Validation of microarray results by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed temporal variation in gene expression profiles.

CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome and metabolome of RP upon GMB1 infestation leading to an HR that was induced by the generation and release of reactive oxygen species i.e. singlet oxygen and resulted in LPO-mediated cell death. RP thus used HR as a means to limit nutrient supply to the feeding maggots and simultaneously accumulated GABA, strategies that could have led to maggot mortality. The integrated results of transcript and metabolic profiling, for the first time, provided insights into an HR+ type of resistance in rice against gall midge.
26842983	An apomixis-linked ORC3-like pseudogene is associated with silencing of its functional homolog in apomictic Paspalum simplex.	2016	J Exp Bot	Apomixis in plants consists of asexual reproduction by seeds. Here we characterized at structural and functional levels an apomixis-linked sequence of Paspalum simplex homologous to subunit 3 of the ORIGIN RECOGNITION COMPLEX (ORC3). ORC is a multiprotein complex which controls DNA replication and cell differentiation in eukaryotes. Three PsORC3 copies were identified, each one characterized by a specific expression profile. Of these, PsORC3a, specific for apomictic genotypes, is a pseudogene that was poorly and constitutively expressed in all developmental stages of apomictic flowers, whereas PsORC3b, the putative functional gene in sexual flowers, showed a precise time-related regulation. Sense transcripts of PsORC3 were expressed in the female cell lineage of both apomictic and sexual reproductive phenotypes, and in aposporous initials. Although strong expression was detected in sexual early endosperm, no expression was present in the apomictic endosperm. Antisense PsORC3 transcripts were revealed exclusively in apomictic germ cell lineages. Defective orc3 mutants of rice and Arabidopsis showed normal female gametophytes although the embryo and endosperm were arrested at early phases of development. We hypothesize that PsORC3a is associated with the down-regulation of its functional homolog and with the development of apomictic endosperm which deviates from the canonical 2(maternal):1(paternal) genome ratio.
26879887	Niclosamide inhibits leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice leaf blight, which is caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), results in huge losses in grain yield. Here, we show that Xoo-induced rice leaf blight is effectively controlled by niclosamide, an oral antihelminthic drug and molluscicide, which also functions as an anti-tumor agent. Niclosamide directly inhibited the growth of the three Xoo strains PXO99, 10208 and K3a. Niclosamide moved long distances from the site of local application to distant rice tissues. Niclosamide also increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes such as OsPR1 and OsWRKY45, which suppressed Xoo-induced leaf wilting. Niclosamide had no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth and yield. These combined results indicate that niclosamide can be used to block bacterial leaf blight in rice with no negative side effects.
26850838	Effect of alanine, leucine, and arginine substitution on antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and action mechanism of a cationic octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase of rice.	2016	Biopolymers	AmyI-1-18, an antimicrobial peptide, is a cationic α-helical octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase of rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) that contains four cationic amino acid residues (two arginines and two lysines). To enhance the antifungal activity of AmyI-1-18 against Candida albicans, 11 analogs bearing substitutions with alanine, leucine, and/or arginine, which were designed on the basis of the helical wheel projection of AmyI-1-18, were synthesized, and their antifungal activity was investigated. The antifungal activities of four analogs obtained by replacing arginine or lysine with alanine were significantly reduced. The results suggested that the cationic arginine and lysine residues in AmyI-1-18 are important for its antifungal activity. The antifungal activities of two single leucine-substituted analogs were not improved, but among three single arginine-substituted analogs, AmyI-1-18(D15R) had approximately a two-fold higher antifungal activity [50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50 ): 31 μM] than AmyI-1-18 (IC50 : 64 μM) and exhibited low hemolytic activity (4% at 100 μM). Flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide revealed that the antifungal activity of AmyI-1-18(D15R) was dependent on its membrane-disrupting activity in a manner different from that of AmyI-1-18. Further enhancement of the cationicity and hydrophobicity of AmyI-1-18(D15R) resulted in no improvement in antifungal activity and a significant increase in hemolytic activity. In this study, the results demonstrated that the antifungal activity of AmyI-1-18 against C. albicans was enhanced through increasing its membrane-disrupting activity by replacing aspartic acid at position 15 with arginine without a significant increase in hemolytic activity.

26729506	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	2016	Plant J	Fertilizers are often potential environmental pollutants, therefore increasing productivity and the efficiency of nutrient uptake to boost crop yields without the risk of environmental pollution is a desirable goal. Here, we show that the transcription factor encoding gene RDD1 plays a role in improving the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions in rice. RDD1 was found to be targeted by the microRNA miR166. An RDD1 transgene driven by a strong constitutive promoter exhibited a diurnally oscillating expression similar to that of the endogenous RDD1, and nucleotide substitution within the miR166 recognition site to prevent miR166-RDD1 mRNA pairing resulted in constitutive RDD1 expression. The RDD1 protein was localized to vascular tissue because miR166 repressed RDD1 expression in the mesophyll. The overexpression of RDD1 induced the expression of genes associated with the transport of several nutrients such as NH4(+), Na(+), SO4(2-), Cl(-), PO4(3-) and sucrose, and the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions under low-nutrient conditions. Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity. Our results suggest that RDD1 can contribute to the increased grain productivity of rice via inducing the efficient uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions.
26885647	Prediction of Phenotypic Effects of Variants Observed in LOC_Os04g36720 of FRO1 Gene in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Interdiscip Sci	In rice, ferric-chelate reductase-1 (FRO1) (LOC_Os04g36720) gene was present on chromosome number 4 and its beginning and ending coordinates where coding sequence lies are 22182599 and 22186943, respectively. It plays a vital role in metal homeostasis and iron transportation in plants. Based on the alignment results, location of single-nucleotide variants is located in open reading frame and their effects of variants were predicted using SIFT sequence tool. The non-synonymous variants at position 342 and 436 lies in helical and coil parts of the protein, respectively, as predicted by Psi-pred server. PSI-Blast which resulted in significant hits and the most similar protein sequence (Accession ID: NP_001052896) with available sequence features displayed 100 % identity with query cover of 99 %. Results suggest the non-synonymous variant at position 436 (Accession ID: TBGI204002) lies in FAD-binding domain and nsSNV at position 342 (Accession ID: TBGI203998) lies in periphery of NADP. The SNPs were also analyzed for the deleterious effect by PANTHER subPSEC scores and I-mutant score, and it was postulated that SNPs would be hampering on biological as well as molecular function of FRO 1 gene of rice. A cutoff of -3 corresponds to a 50 % probability that a score is deleterious. From this, the probability that a given variant will cause a deleterious effect on protein function is estimated by P deleterious, such that a subPSEC score of -4 corresponds to a P deleterious of 0.79. Hence, to study the phenotypic consequences of variant TBGI204002, we performed comparative molecular docking studies of native modeled protein and protein with induced mutation as receptors and FAD as ligand to be utilized for binding. The docking process was performed by AutoDock 4.2 software with Lamarckian Genetic algorithm as computational algorithm. Results suggest binding energies are higher in case of mutation-induced protein which suggests presence of variant TBGI204002 enhances binding of FAD ligand at FAD-binding domain site. In case of TBGI203998, similar comparative docking procedure was performed with FAD as binding ligand, which suggests presence of variant does not impact FAD binding at the domain site. We revealed impact of SNPs on the protein structure and its function using sequence-based tools.
26883045	A splice acceptor site mutation in TaGW2-A1 increases thousand grain weight in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat through wider and longer grains.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Across 13 experiments the gw2 - A1 mutant allele shifts grain size distribution consistently across all grains significantly increasing grain weight (6.6 %), width (2.8 %) and length (2.1 %) in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. There is an urgent need to identify, understand and incorporate alleles that benefit yield in polyploid wheat. The rice OsGW2 gene functions as a negative regulator of grain weight and width and is homologous to the wheat TaGW2 gene. Previously it was shown that transcript levels of the A-genome homoeologue, TaGW2-A1, are negatively associated with grain width in hexaploid wheat. In this study we screened the tetraploid Kronos TILLING population to identify mutants in TaGW2-A1. We identified a G to A transition in the splice acceptor site of exon 5 which leads to mis-splicing in TaGW2-A1. We backcrossed the mutant allele into tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and generated a series of backcross derived isogenic lines which were evaluated in glasshouse and field conditions. Across 13 experiments the GW2-A1 mutant allele significantly increased thousand grain weight (6.6 %), grain width (2.8 %) and grain length (2.1 %) in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat compared to the wild type allele. In hexaploid wheat, this led to an increase in spike yield since no differences were detected for spikelet or grain number between isogenic lines. The increase in grain width and length was consistent across grains of different sizes, suggesting that the effect of the mutation is stable across the ear and within spikelets. Differences in carpel size and weight between alleles were identified as early as 5 days before anthesis, suggesting that TaGW2-A1 acts on maternal tissue before anthesis to restrict seed size. A single nucleotide polymorphism marker was developed to aid the deployment of the mutant allele into breeding programmes.
26878189	Product Rearrangement from Altering a Single Residue in the Rice syn-Copalyl Diphosphate Synthase.	2016	Org Lett	Through site-directed mutagenesis targeted at identification of the catalytic base in the rice (Oryza sativa) syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase OsCPS4, changes to a single residue (H501) were found to induce rearrangement rather than immediate deprotonation of the initially formed bicycle, leading to production of the novel compound syn-halimadienyl diphosphate. These mutational results are combined with quantum chemical calculations to provide insight into the underlying reaction mechanism.
26912801	OsMPK6 plays a critical role in cell differentiation during early embryogenesis in Oryza sativa.	2016	J Exp Bot	The formation of body axes is the basis of morphogenesis during plant embryogenesis. We identified embryo-lethal mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) in which T-DNAs were inserted in OsMPK6 Embryonic organs were absent because their development was arrested at the globular stage. Similar to observations made with gle4, shootless, and organless, the osmpk6 mutations affected the initial step of cell differentiation. Expression of an apical-basal axis marker gene, OSH1, was reduced in the mutant embryos while that of the radial axes marker genes OsSCR and OsPNH1 was not detected. The signal for ROC1, a protodermal cell marker, was weak at the globular stage and gradually disappeared. Transcript levels of auxin and gibberellin biosynthesis genes were diminished in osmpk6 embryos. In addition, phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were down-regulated in osmpk6 and a major diterpene phytoalexin, momilactone A, did not accumulate in the mutant embryos. These results indicate that OsMPK6 begins to play a critical role during early embryogenesis, especially when the L1 radial axis is being formed.
26910783	Elevated Ozone Deteriorates Grain Quality of Japonica Rice cv. Koshihikari, Even if it Does Not Cause Yield Reduction.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: It is becoming clear that ozone affects not only grain yield but also grain quality in rice. However, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for ozone-induced changes in appearance quality or components are poorly understood. We analyzed appearance quality and starch composition in the rice cultivars "Koshihikari" (japonica) and "Kasalath" (indica) grown under elevated ozone conditions.

RESULTS: Elevated ozone significantly increased the proportion of immature (mainly chalky) kernels in "Koshihikari" but not in "Kasalath". Scanning electron microscopy of transverse sections of kernels showed that endosperm starch granules of "Koshihikari" ripened under elevated ozone were loosely packed with large spaces and contained irregular rounded granules. Amylose content was increased in "Koshihikari" kernels with ozone exposure, but was unchanged in "Kasalath" kernels. Distribution analysis of amylopectin chain length showed that ozone induces a decrease of long-side chains and alterations of short side-chains in "Koshihikari" kernels. Furthermore, Starch Synthase (SS) IIIa transcript levels in "Koshihikari" caryopses were decreased by elevated ozone.

CONCLUSIONS: The japonica cultivar "Koshihikari" showed significant deterioration in appearance quality of kernels caused by abnormal starch accumulation due to exposure to ozone. The alteration patterns of amylose and amylopectin in ozone-exposed rice kernels are similar to those in rice kernels harvested from SSIIIa-deficient mutants. These findings suggest that the increase of chalky kernels in ozone-treated "Koshihikari" is partly attributable to the repressed expression of SSIIIa involved in amylopectin side-chain elongation with ozone exposure. Elevated ozone reduced appearance quality in "Koshihikari" although it did not impair starch properties contributing to the eating quality of cooked rice.
26847792	Fine Mapping Identifies a New QTL for Brown Rice Rate in Rice (Oryza Sativa L.).	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: High yield and quality determine the commercial potential of rice variety. Brown rice rate (BRR) is a key factor ensuring grain yield and quality in rice. So far, there were few reports about the genes that directly controlled the BRR in rice. Therefore, dissecting the genetic mechanism of the BRR genes can facilitate improving effective rice supply or edible grain yield.

RESULTS: A double haploid population derived from the cross between Taichung Native 1 (TN1) (an indica variety) and Chunjiang 06 (CJ06) (a japonica variety) was used to investigate the genetic basis of grain milling and appearance traits affecting the BRR. By using a constructed molecular linkage map, four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the BRR were detected on chromosomes 1, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. In addition, three QTLs for appearance traits, including grain weight and grain length/width ratio, were detected on chromosomes 6, 9 and 10, respectively. Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) were established at the qBRR-10 locus. Finally, the qBRR-10 was narrowed to a 39.5 kb region on chromosome 10. In this region, two candidate genes, LOC_Os10g32124 and LOC_Os10g32190, showed significantly differential expression in TN1 and CSSL1-2 compared with CJ06. Histocytological analysis suggested that cell size and hull thickness may be important factors for the BRR.

CONCLUSION: In the study, the qBRR-10 affected the BRR and was finally located to a region between two markers, P13 and P14. Two candidate genes were selected based on the expression difference between two parents, which facilitated the further cloning of the qBRR-10 gene and largely contributed to improve the grain yield and quality in rice.
26884603	Cell wall-associated ROOT HAIR SPECIFIC 10, a proline-rich receptor-like kinase, is a negative modulator of Arabidopsis root hair growth.	2016	J Exp Bot	Plant cell growth is restricted by the cell wall, and cell wall dynamics act as signals for the cytoplasmic and nuclear events of cell growth. Among various receptor kinases, ROOT HAIR SPECIFIC 10 (RHS10) belongs to a poorly known receptor kinase subfamily with a proline-rich extracellular domain. Here, we report that RHS10 defines the root hair length of Arabidopsis thaliana by negatively regulating hair growth. RHS10 modulates the duration of root hair growth rather than the growth rate. As poplar and rice RHS10 orthologs also showed a root hair-inhibitory function, this receptor kinase-mediated function appears to be conserved in angiosperms. RHS10 showed a strong association with the cell wall, most probably through its extracellular proline-rich domain (ECD). Deletion analysis of the ECD demonstrated that a minimal extracellular part, which includes a few proline residues, is required for RHS10-mediated root hair inhibition. RHS10 suppressed the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the root, which are necessary for root hair growth. A yeast two-hybrid screening identified an RNase (RNS2) as a putative downstream target of RHS10. Accordingly, RHS10 overexpression decreased and RHS10 loss increased RNA levels in the hair-growing root region. Our results suggest that RHS10 mediates cell wall-associated signals to maintain proper root hair length, at least in part by regulating RNA catabolism and ROS accumulation.
26829979	The DELLA Protein SLR1 Integrates and Amplifies Salicylic Acid- and Jasmonic Acid-Dependent Innate Immunity in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Gibberellins are a class of tetracyclic plant hormones that are well known to promote plant growth by inducing the degradation of a class of nuclear growth-repressing proteins, called DELLAs. In recent years, GA and DELLAs are also increasingly implicated in plant responses to pathogen attack, although our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still limited, especially in monocotyledonous crop plants. Aiming to further decipher the molecular underpinnings of GA- and DELLA-modulated plant immunity, we studied the dynamics and impact of GA and DELLA during infection of the model crop rice (Oryza sativa) with four different pathogens exhibiting distinct lifestyles and infection strategies. Opposite to previous findings in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), our findings reveal a prominent role of the DELLA protein Slender Rice1 (SLR1) in the resistance toward (hemi)biotrophic but not necrotrophic rice pathogens. Moreover, contrary to the differential effect of DELLA on the archetypal defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that the resistance-promoting effect of SLR1 is due at least in part to its ability to boost both SA- and JA-mediated rice defenses. In a reciprocal manner, we found JA and SA treatment to interfere with GA metabolism and stabilize SLR1. Together, these findings favor a model whereby SLR1 acts as a positive regulator of hemibiotroph resistance in rice by integrating and amplifying SA- and JA-dependent defense signaling. Our results highlight the differences in hormone defense networking between rice and Arabidopsis and underscore the importance of GA and DELLA in molding disease outcomes.
26909982	Population structure of rice varieties used in Turkish rice breeding programs determined using simple-sequence repeat and inter-primer binding site-retrotransposon data.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Effective breeding programs based on genetic diversity are needed to broaden the genetic basis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Turkey. In this study, 81 commercial varieties from seven countries were studied in order to estimate the genomic relationships among them using nine inter-primer binding site (iPBS)-retrotransposon and 17 simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 59 alleles for the SSR markers and 96 bands for the iPBS-retrotransposon markers were detected, with an average of 3.47 and 10.6 per locus, respectively. Each of the varieties could be unequivocally identified by the SSR and iPBS-retrotransposon profiles. The iPBS-retrotransposon- and SSR-based clustering were identical and closely mirrored each other, with a significantly high correlation (r = 0.73). A neighbor-joining cluster based on the combined SSR and iPBS-retrotransposon data divided the rice varieties into three clusters. The population structure was determined using the STRUCTURE software, and three populations (K = 3) were identified among the varieties studied, showing that the diversity harbored by Turkish rice varieties is low. The results indicate that iPBS-retrotransposon markers are a very powerful technique to determine the genetic diversity of rice varieties.
26860200	Genome-wide prediction models that incorporate de novo GWAS are a powerful new tool for tropical rice improvement.	2016	Heredity (Edinb)	To address the multiple challenges to food security posed by global climate change, population growth and rising incomes, plant breeders are developing new crop varieties that can enhance both agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. Current breeding practices, however, are unable to keep pace with demand. Genomic selection (GS) is a new technique that helps accelerate the rate of genetic gain in breeding by using whole-genome data to predict the breeding value of offspring. Here, we describe a new GS model that combines RR-BLUP with markers fit as fixed effects selected from the results of a genome-wide-association study (GWAS) on the RR-BLUP training data. We term this model GS + de novo GWAS. In a breeding population of tropical rice, GS + de novo GWAS outperformed six other models for a variety of traits and in multiple environments. On the basis of these results, we propose an extended, two-part breeding design that can be used to efficiently integrate novel variation into elite breeding populations, thus expanding genetic diversity and enhancing the potential for sustainable productivity gains.
26850278	A Co-Opted Hormonal Cascade Activates Dormant Adventitious Root Primordia upon Flooding in Solanum dulcamara.	2016	Plant Physiol	Soil flooding is a common stress factor affecting plants. To sustain root function in the hypoxic environment, flooding-tolerant plants may form new, aerenchymatous adventitious roots (ARs), originating from preformed, dormant primordia on the stem. We investigated the signaling pathway behind AR primordium reactivation in the dicot species Solanum dulcamara Transcriptome analysis indicated that flooding imposes a state of quiescence on the stem tissue, while increasing cellular activity in the AR primordia. Flooding led to ethylene accumulation in the lower stem region and subsequently to a drop in abscisic acid (ABA) level in both stem and AR primordia tissue. Whereas ABA treatment prevented activation of AR primordia by flooding, inhibition of ABA synthesis was sufficient to activate them in absence of flooding. Together, this reveals that there is a highly tissue-specific response to reduced ABA levels. The central role for ABA in the response differentiates the pathway identified here from the AR emergence pathway known from rice (Oryza sativa). Flooding and ethylene treatment also induced expression of the polar auxin transporter PIN2, and silencing of this gene or chemical inhibition of auxin transport inhibited primordium activation, even though ABA levels were reduced. Auxin treatment, however, was not sufficient for AR emergence, indicating that the auxin pathway acts in parallel with the requirement for ABA reduction. In conclusion, adaptation of S. dulcamara to wet habitats involved co-option of a hormonal signaling cascade well known to regulate shoot growth responses, to direct a root developmental program upon soil flooding.
26848586	Nucleolar DEAD-Box RNA Helicase TOGR1 Regulates Thermotolerant Growth as a Pre-rRNA Chaperone in Rice.	2016	PLoS Genet	Plants have evolved a considerable number of intrinsic tolerance strategies to acclimate to ambient temperature increase. However, their molecular mechanisms remain largely obscure. Here we report a DEAD-box RNA helicase, TOGR1 (Thermotolerant Growth Required1), prerequisite for rice growth themotolerance. Regulated by both temperature and the circadian clock, its expression is tightly coupled to daily temperature fluctuations and its helicase activities directly promoted by temperature increase. Located in the nucleolus and associated with the small subunit (SSU) pre-rRNA processome, TOGR1 maintains a normal rRNA homeostasis at high temperature. Natural variation in its transcript level is positively correlated with plant height and its overexpression significantly improves rice growth under hot conditions. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism of RNA helicase as a key chaperone for rRNA homeostasis required for rice thermotolerant growth and provide a potential strategy to breed heat-tolerant crops by modulating the expression of TOGR1 and its orthologs.
26888633	Shade-induced stem elongation in rice seedlings: Implication of tissue-specific phytohormone regulation.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	A better understanding of shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) is an urgent need because of its effect on energy reallocation. Leverage-related mechanism in crops is of potential economic interest for agricultural applications. Here we report the SAS phenotype at tissue level rice seedlings. Tissue-specific RNA-sequencing indicates auxin plays different roles between coleoptile and the first leaf. Phenotypes of wild type treated by gibberellin and brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitors and of related mutants suggest these two hormones positively regulate SAS. Our work reveals the diversity of hormone responses in different organs and different species in shade conditions.
26831622	Characterization of IRE1 ribonuclease-mediated mRNA decay in plants using transient expression analyses in rice protoplasts.	2016	New Phytol	In some eukaryotes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces regulated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-dependent decay (RIDD) of mRNAs. Recently, the expression levels of the mRNAs encoding some secretory proteins were reported to be downregulated by RIDD in the vegetative tissues of plants. However, the characteristics of plant RIDD have been insufficiently investigated due to difficulty of in planta analyses. Here, the RIDD susceptibilities of various mRNAs that are difficult to analyze in planta were examined using transient expression analyses of rice protoplasts. In this system, the mRNAs encoding three rice seed storage proteins (SSPs) - namely α-globulin, 16-kDa prolamin and 10-kDa prolamin - were downregulated in response to ER stress. The rapid ER stress-induced degradation of these mRNAs was repressed in cells in which the ribonuclease activity of IRE1 was specifically abolished by genome editing, suggesting that the mRNAs encoding certain SSPs are strong targets of RIDD. Furthermore, we investigated whether these RIDD targets are substrates of the IRE1 ribonuclease using a recombinant IRE1 protein, and identified candidate IRE1-mediated cleavage sites. Overall, the results demonstrate the existence of a post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation of SSPs, and illustrate the basic and multifaceted characteristics of RIDD in higher plants.
26891616	Selection of highly efficient sgRNAs for CRISPR/Cas9-based plant genome editing.	2016	Sci Rep	The CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA system has been developed to mediate genome editing and become a powerful tool for biological research. Employing the CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA system for genome editing and manipulation has accelerated research and expanded researchers' ability to generate genetic models. However, the method evaluating the efficiency of sgRNAs is lacking in plants. Based on the nucleotide compositions and secondary structures of sgRNAs which have been experimentally validated in plants, we instituted criteria to design efficient sgRNAs. To facilitate the assembly of multiple sgRNA cassettes, we also developed a new strategy to rapidly construct CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA system for multiplex editing in plants. In theory, up to ten single guide RNA (sgRNA) cassettes can be simultaneously assembled into the final binary vectors. As a proof of concept, 21 sgRNAs complying with the criteria were designed and the corresponding Cas9/sgRNAs expression vectors were constructed. Sequencing analysis of transgenic rice plants suggested that 82% of the desired target sites were edited with deletion, insertion, substitution, and inversion, displaying high editing efficiency. This work provides a convenient approach to select efficient sgRNAs for target editing.
26848096	Evolution of VRN2/Ghd7-Like Genes in Vernalization-Mediated Repression of Grass Flowering.	2016	Plant Physiol	Flowering of many plant species is coordinated with seasonal environmental cues such as temperature and photoperiod. Vernalization provides competence to flower after prolonged cold exposure, and a vernalization requirement prevents flowering from occurring prior to winter. In winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), three genes VRN1, VRN2, and FT form a regulatory loop that regulates the initiation of flowering. Prior to cold exposure, VRN2 represses FT. During cold, VRN1 expression increases, resulting in the repression of VRN2, which in turn allows activation of FT during long days to induce flowering. Here, we test whether the circuitry of this regulatory loop is conserved across Pooideae, consistent with their niche transition from the tropics to the temperate zone. Our phylogenetic analyses of VRN2-like genes reveal a duplication event occurred before the diversification of the grasses that gave rise to a CO9 and VRN2/Ghd7 clade and support orthology between wheat/barley VRN2 and rice (Oryza sativa) Ghd7 Our Brachypodium distachyon VRN1 and VRN2 knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrate functional conservation of grass VRN1 and VRN2 in the promotion and repression of flowering, respectively. However, expression analyses in a range of pooids demonstrate that the cold repression of VRN2 is unique to core Pooideae such as wheat and barley. Furthermore, VRN1 knockdown in B. distachyon demonstrates that the VRN1-mediated suppression of VRN2 is not conserved. Thus, the VRN1-VRN2 feature of the regulatory loop appears to have evolved late in the diversification of temperate grasses.
26898554	Dose-dependent response of Trichoderma harzianum in improving drought tolerance in rice genotypes.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a dose-dependent response of Trichoderma harzianum Th-56 in improving drought tolerance in rice by modulating proline, SOD, lipid peroxidation product and DHN / AQU transcript level, and the growth attributes. In the present study, the effect of colonization of different doses of T. harzianum Th-56 strain in rice genotypes were evaluated under drought stress. The rice genotypes treated with increasing dose of T. harzianum strain Th-56 showed better drought tolerance as compared with untreated control plant. There was significant change in malondialdehyde, proline, higher superoxide dismutase level, plant height, total dry matter, relative chlorophyll content, leaf rolling, leaf tip burn, and the number of scorched/senesced leaves in T. harzianum Th-56 treated rice genotypes under drought stress. This was corroborated with altered expression of aquaporin and dehydrin genes in T. harzianum Th-56 treated rice genotypes. The present findings suggest that a dose of 30 g/L was the most effective in improving drought tolerance in rice, and its potential exploitation will contribute to the advancement of rice genotypes to sustain crop productivity under drought stress. Interaction studies of T. harzianum with three aromatic rice genotypes suggested that PSD-17 was highly benefitted from T. harzianum colonization under drought stress.
26829414	Light-mediated modulation of helix angle and rate of seminal root tip movement determines root morphology of young rice seedlings.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Seminal root growth is one of the factors to determine rice seedling establishment. Our previous reports showed light can induce Z-type wavy root and coiling root morphology in several rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties, and the regulated Z-type and unregulated coil seminal roots were resulted by different circumnutational trajectories. Moreover, the light-induced seminal root waving was conducted by an NO-dependent signaling pathway. In order to further reveal the difference of root tip movement between straight and wavy seminal roots; here, the root tip movement trajectories of Tainung 67 variety (TNG67; presented straight root in light conditions) and Taichung Native 1 (TCN1; presented Z-type wavy root in light) were recorded and analyzed in both white light and dark (dim far-red light was applied in dark for taking time-lapse photography) conditions. The results showed the root tip movement of both rice varieties in low intensity of dim far-red light conditions were followed the circumnutation path. However, the stimuli of high intensity of white light would increase the root helix angle in TCN1 seedlings but not in TNG67. In addition, slowing down the rate of root helix was induced by white light treatment in TCN1 but not in TNG67 seedlings. In conclusion, changes of TCN1 rice seminal root morphology from straight to wavy type stimulated by light was resulted by both helix angle increasing and circumnutation rate slowing of root tip movement.
26907500	Comprehensive Genomic Analysis and Expression Profiling of the NOX Gene Families under Abiotic Stresses and Hormones in Plants.	2016	Genome Biol Evol	Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are key producers of reactive oxygen species under both normal and stress conditions in plants and they form functional subfamilies. Studies of these subfamilies indicated that they show considerable evolutionary selection. We performed a comparative genomic analysis that identified 50 ferric reduction oxidases (FRO) and 77 NOX gene homologs from 20 species representing the eight major plant lineages within the supergroup Plantae: glaucophytes, rhodophytes, chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, monocots, and eudicots. Phylogenetic and structural analysis classified these FRO and NOX genes into four well-conserved groups represented as NOX, FRO I, FRO II, and FRO III. Further analysis of NOXs of phylogenetic and exon/intron structures showed that single intron loss and gain had occurred, yielding the diversified gene structures during the evolution of NOXs family genes and which were classified into four conserved subfamilies which are represented as Sub.I, Sub.II, Sub.III, and Sub.IV. Additionally, both available global microarray data analysis and quantitative real-time PCR experiments revealed that the NOX genes in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) have different expression patterns in different developmental stages, various abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Finally, coexpression network analysis of NOX genes in Arabidopsis and rice revealed that NOXs have significantly correlated expression profiles with genes which are involved in plants metabolic and resistance progresses. All these results suggest that NOX family underscores the functional diversity and divergence in plants. This finding will facilitate further studies of the NOX family and provide valuable information for functional validation of this family in plants.
26927068	The Indeterminate Domain Protein ROC1 Regulates Chilling Tolerance via Activation of DREB1B/CBF1 in Rice.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Abiotic stress, including salinity, drought and cold, severely affect diverse aspects of plant development and production. Rice is an important crop that does not acclimate to cold; therefore, it is relatively sensitive to low temperature stress. Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1s (DREB1s)/C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) are well known for their function in cold tolerance, but the transcriptional regulation of CBFs remains elusive, especially in rice. Here, we performed a yeast one-hybrid assay using the promoter of CBF1, a cold-induced gene, to isolate transcriptional regulators of CBF1. Among the seven candidates identified, an indeterminate domain (IDD) protein named ROC1 (a regulator of CBF1) was further analyzed. The ROC1 transcript was induced by exogenously-treated auxin, while it was not altered by cold or ABA stimuli. ROC1-GFP was localized at the nucleus, and ROC1 showed trans-activation activity in yeast. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP analyses revealed that ROC1 directly bound to the promoter of CBF1. Furthermore, ROC1 mutants exhibited chilling-sensitive symptoms and inhibited cold-mediated induction of CBF1 and CBF3, indicating that ROC1 is a positive regulator of cold stress responses. Taken together, this study identified the CBF1 regulator, and the results are important for rice plant adaptation to chilling stress.
26867598	Development of leaffolder resistant transgenic rice expressing cry2AX1 gene driven by green tissue-specific rbcS promoter.	2016	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	The insecticidal cry genes of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been successfully used for development of insect resistant transgenic rice plants. In this study, a novel cry2AX1 gene consisting a sequence of cry2Aa and cry2Ac gene driven by rice rbcS promoter was introduced into a rice cultivar, ASD16. Among 27 putative rice transformants, 20 plants were found to be positive for cry2AX1 gene. The expression of Cry2AX1 protein in transgenic rice plants ranged from 5.95 to 122.40 ng/g of fresh leaf tissue. Stable integration of the transgene was confirmed in putative transformants of rice by Southern blot hybridization analysis. Insect bioassay on T0 transgenic rice plants against rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrosis medinalis) recorded larval mortality up to 83.33%. Stable inheritance and expression of cry2AX1 gene in T1 progenies was demonstrated using Southern and ELISA. The detached leaf bit bioassay with selected T1 plants showed 83.33-90.00% mortality against C. medinalis. The whole plant bioassay for T1 plants with rice leaffolder showed significant level of resistance even at a lower level of Cry2AX1 expression varying from 131 to 158 ng/g fresh leaf tissue during tillering stage.
26883225	Physiological controls of chrysanthemum DgD27 gene expression in regulation of shoot branching.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: DgD27 was cloned from D. grandiflorum for the first time and played an important role in shoot branching of chrysanthemum. Shoot branching plays an important role in determining plant architecture. D27 was previously proven to be involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway in rice, Arabidopsis, and Medicago. To investigate the role of D27 in shoot branching of chrysanthemum, we isolated the D27 homolog DgD27. Functional analysis showed that DgD27 was a plastid-localized protein that restored the phenotype of Arabidopsis d27-1. Gene expression analysis revealed that DgD27 was expressed at the highest levels in stem, and was up-regulated by exogenous auxin. Decapitation could down-regulate DgD27 expression, but this effect could be restored by exogenous auxin. DgD27 expression was significantly down-regulated by dark treatment in axillary buds. In addition, DgD27 transcripts produced rapid responses in shoots and roots under conditions of phosphate absence, but only mild variation in responses in buds, stems, and roots with low nitrogen treatment. DgBRC1 transcripts also showed the same response in buds under low nitrogen conditions. Under phosphate deficiency, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels increased, zeatin riboside levels decreased, and abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased in the shoot, while both IAA and ABA levels increased in the shoot under low nitrogen treatments. Gibberellin acid levels were unaffected by phosphate deficiency and low nitrogen treatments. Taken together, these results demonstrated the diverse roles of DgD27 in response to physiological controls in chrysanthemum shoot branching.
26893418	Draft Genome Sequence of Pantoea ananatis Strain AMG521, a Rice Plant Growth-Promoting Bacterial Endophyte Isolated from the Guadalquivir Marshes in Southern Spain.	2016	Genome Announc	The rice endophyte Pantoea ananatis AMG521 shows several plant growth-promoting properties and promotes rice yield increases. Its draft genome was estimated at 4,891,568 bp with 4,704 coding sequences (CDS). The genome encodes genes for N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) synthases, AHL hydrolases, hyperadherence (yidQ, yidP, and yidR), fusaric acid resistance, and oxidation of lignin, highlighting its biotechnological potential.
26858364	A Signaling Cascade from miR444 to RDR1 in Rice Antiviral RNA Silencing Pathway.	2016	Plant Physiol	Plant RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE1 (RDR1) is a key component of the antiviral RNA-silencing pathway, contributing to the biogenesis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs. This enzyme also is responsible for producing virus-activated endogenous small interfering RNAs to stimulate the broad-spectrum antiviral activity through silencing host genes. The expression of RDR1 orthologs in various plants is usually induced by virus infection. However, the molecular mechanisms of activation of RDR1 expression in response to virus infection remain unknown. Here, we show that a monocot-specific microRNA, miR444, is a key factor in relaying the antiviral signaling from virus infection to OsRDR1 expression. The expression of miR444 is enhanced by infection with Rice stripe virus (RSV), and overexpression of miR444 improves rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against RSV infection accompanied by the up-regulation of OsRDR1 expression. We further show that three miR444 targets, the MIKC(C)-type MADS box proteins OsMADS23, OsMADS27a, and OsMADS57, form homodimers and heterodimers between them to repress the expression of OsRDR1 by directly binding to the CArG motifs of its promoter. Consequently, an increased level of miR444 diminishes the repressive roles of OsMADS23, OsMADS27a, and OsMADS57 on OsRDR1 transcription, thus activating the OsRDR1-dependent antiviral RNA-silencing pathway. We also show that overexpression of miR444-resistant OsMADS57 reduced OsRDR1 expression and rice resistance against RSV infection, and knockout of OsRDR1 reduced rice resistance against RSV infection. In conclusion, our results reveal a molecular cascade in the rice antiviral pathway in which miR444 and its MADS box targets directly control OsRDR1 transcription.
26848538	Integration of decoy domains derived from protein targets of pathogen effectors into plant immune receptors is widespread.	2016	New Phytol	Plant immune receptors of the class of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain (NLR) proteins can contain additional domains besides canonical NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC)) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Recent research suggests that these additional domains act as integrated decoys recognizing effectors from pathogens. Proteins homologous to integrated decoys are suspected to be effector targets and involved in disease or resistance. Here, we scrutinized 31 entire plant genomes to identify putative integrated decoy domains in NLR proteins using the Interpro search. The involvement of the Zinc Finger-BED type (ZBED) protein containing a putative decoy domain, called BED, in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance was investigated by evaluating susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice over-expression and knock-out mutants. This analysis showed that all plants tested had integrated various atypical protein domains into their NLR proteins (on average 3.5% of all NLR proteins). We also demonstrated that modifying the expression of the ZBED gene modified disease susceptibility. This study suggests that integration of decoy domains in NLR immune receptors is widespread and frequent in plants. The integrated decoy model is therefore a powerful concept to identify new proteins involved in disease resistance. Further in-depth examination of additional domains in NLR proteins promises to unravel many new proteins of the plant immune system.
26909954	Transgenic rice expressing a cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) plasma membrane gene MePMP3-2 exhibits enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Plasma membrane proteolipid 3 (PMP3) is a class of small hydrophobic proteins found in many organisms including higher plants. Some plant PMP3 genes have been shown to respond to abiotic stresses and to participate in the processes of plant stress tolerance. In this study, we isolated the cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) MePMP3-2 gene and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by expressing it in rice (Oryza sativa L.). MePMP3-2 encodes a 77-amino acid protein belonging to a subgroup of plant PMP3s that have long hydrophylic C-terminal tails of unknown function. In silico analysis and co-localization studies indicated that MePMP3-2 is a plasma membrane protein with two transmembrane domains, similar to other PMP3s. In cassava leaves, MePMP3-2 expression was up-regulated by salt and drought stresses. Heterologous constitutive expression of MePMP3-2 in rice did not alter plant growth and development but increased tolerance to salt and drought stresses. In addition, under stress conditions MePMP3-2 transgenic plants accumulated less malondialdehyde, had increased levels of proline, and exhibited greater up-regulation of the stress-related genes OsProT and OsP5CS, but led to only minor changes in OsDREB2A and OsLEA3 expression. These findings indicate that MePMP3-2 may play an important role in salt and drought stress tolerance in transgenic rice.
26860054	Interactions between wheat Tubby-like and SKP1-like proteins.	2015	Genes Genet Syst	Tubby proteins are highly conserved in a wide range of multicellular organisms. The Tubby gene family was first verified in obese mice. In plants, 11 Tubby genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, 14 in rice, and 11 in poplar. However, there is very little information about Tubby-like proteins in wheat. In this study, we identified four Tubby-like protein genes (TaTULP1-TaTULP4) in wheat. A comparison of the gene structure showed a conserved exon number pattern in TaTULPs, although the length of the introns differed. With the exception of TaTULP2, TaTULPs had four exons. To identify the chromosome localization of TaTULPs, BLASTn analyses were performed using the URGI database to predict the chromosomal location of TaTULP genes. TaTULP1, 2, 3 and 4 genes were localized on chromosomes 4, 5, 7 and 2. All TaTULPs harbor a Tubby domain in their C-terminal region and an F-box domain in the N terminus. We investigated protein-protein interactions between the F-box domain of TaTULPs and various wheat SKP1-like proteins (TaSKPs) using the yeast two-hybrid system. TaTULP1, TaTULP3 and TaTULP4 were found to interact with TaSKP1, TaSKP3 and TaSKP6, whereas TaTULP2 showed no interaction with TaSKP proteins. TaTULP proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein were targeted to the Golgi apparatus in plant cells. Our analysis of TaTULPs will aid in understanding the functions of TaTULPs in plants.
26993232	1-MCP treatment enhanced expression of genes controlling endosperm cell division and starch biosynthesis for improvement of grain filling in a dense-panicle rice cultivar.	2016	Plant Sci	High ethylene production in dense-panicle rice cultivars impacts grain filling. 1-MCP (ethylene action inhibitor) treatment increased assimilates partitioning, cell number and size and expression of starch synthesizing enzyme genes of developing caryopses mostly in the basal spikelets of panicle at early post-anthesis stage. The gain in cell number was less compared to the increase of size. High ethylene production in spikelets matched with greater expression of ethylene receptor and signal transducer genes. Genes encoding cell cycle regulators CDK, CYC and CKI expressed poorly on 9 DAA. 1-MCP treatment enhanced their expression; the increase of expression was higher for CDKs and lower for CKIs in basal compared to apical spikelets. Greater expression of CDKB2:1 might have lifted cytokinesis of nascent peripheral cells of endosperm, while promotion of CDKAs, CYCD2:2 and inhibition of CYCB2:2 expression contributed to endoreduplication of central cells increasing cell size and DNA ploidy level. It is concluded that the process of endoreduplication, which begins at mid-grain filling stage, is crucially linked with the final caryopsis size of rice grain. The enhanced endosperm growth brought about by repressed ethylene action during the first few days after anthesis seems to be associated with the overall increased cell cycle activity and sink strength.
26935445	In silico exploration for agonists/antagonists of brassinolide.	2016	Bioorg Med Chem Lett	Brassinolide (BL) is a plant steroid hormone that is necessary for stem elongation and cell division. To date more than 70 steroidal BL-like compounds, which are collectively named as brassinosteroids, have been identified. However, non-steroidal compounds that mimic BL have not been reported yet, which can be used as plant growth regulators. Twenty-two non-steroidal compounds were screened from the database containing about 5 million compound structures using a pharmacophore-based in silico screening method. The crystal structure (PDB: 4LSX) of the BL receptor was used to generate a pharmacophore model required for in silico screening. Among 22 hit compounds, 15 compounds that are thought to be physicochemically acceptable were submitted to the in vivo rice lamina inclination assay. Although no compound showed BL like activity, three compounds were detected as BL antagonist. The most potent compound was an ester derivative of 1,4-diphenlenedimethanol and isoxazole-4-carboxylic acid, and the other two compounds contain 2-phenylfuran and pyrimidin-2(1H)-one moieties bridged by an ethenyl substructure. The 50% effective doses (ED50) for the antagonistic activity were in a range of 0.6-5nmol per plant. The inhibition of the lamina inclination by the most potent agonist was recovered by the co-application of BL in a dose-dependent manner.
26907775	[CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing systems and the analysis of targeted genome mutations in plants].	2016	Yi Chuan	Targeted genomic editing technologies use programmable DNA nucleases to cleave genomic target sites, thus inducing targeted mutations in the genomes. The newly prevailed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system that consists of the Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNA (sgRNA) has the advantages of simplicity and high efficiency as compared to other programmable DNA nuclease systems such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs). Currently, a number of cases have been reported on the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technology in plants. In this review, we summarize the strategies for preparing the Cas9 and sgRNA expression constructs, the transformation method for obtaining targeted mutations, the efficiency and features of the resulting mutations and the methods for detecting or genotyping of the mutation sites. We also discuss the existing problems and perspectives of CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic editing in plants.
26842979	The role of root size versus root efficiency in phosphorus acquisition in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	In rice, genotypic differences in phosphorus (P) uptake from P-deficient soils are generally proportional to differences in root biomass or surface area (RSA). It is not known to what extent genotypic variation for root efficiency (RE) exists or contributes to P uptake. We evaluated 196 rice accessions under P deficiency and detected wide variation for root biomass which was significantly associated with plant performance. However, at a given root size, up to 3-fold variation in total biomass existed, indicating that genotypes differed in how efficiently their root system acquired P to support overall plant growth. This was subsequently confirmed, identifying a traditional genotype, DJ123, with 2.5-fold higher RE (32.5 µg P cm(-2) RSA) compared with the popular modern cultivar IR64. A P depletion experiment indicated that RE could not be explained by P uptake kinetics since even IR64 depleted P to <20nM. A genome-wide association study identified loci associated with RE, and in most cases the more common marker type improved RE. This may indicate that modern rice cultivars lost the ability for efficient P uptake, possibly because they were selected under highly fertile conditions. One association detected on chromosome 11 that was present in a small group of seven accessions (including DJ123) improved RE above the level already present in many traditional rice accessions. This subspecies is known to harbor genes enhancing stress tolerance, and DJ123 may thus serve as a donor of RE traits and genes that modern cultivars seem to have lost.
26936532	Instant rice made from white and pigmented giant embryonic rice reduces lipid levels and body weight in high fat diet-fed mice.	None	Obes Res Clin Pract	PROBLEM: With the growing health problem on obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, functional foods with hypolipidemic and body fat-lowering effects are greatly needed. The effects of instant rice made from a combination of pigmented giant embryonic rice (Keunnunjami) and white rice, in comparison with those of instant non-pigmented giant embryonic brown rice and instant ordinary brown rice, on the lipid metabolism and body weight in mice under high fat diet condition were investigated.

METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice (n=48) were given experimental diets for seven weeks: normal control (NC), high fat (HF), and HF supplemented with instant normal brown rice (HF-NB), non-pigmented giant embryonic brown rice (HF-GB), and white rice with 8% Keununnjami (HF-KJ8) or 18% Keunnunjami (HF-KJ18). Their body weight gain, plasma lipid profile, adipokine level, lipid-regulating enzymes activities, and mRNA expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were determined.

RESULTS: At the end of the experimental period, the HF mice exhibited significantly higher body weight and fat, plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, and atherogenic index and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration than the NC group. However, diet supplementation of instant rice counteracted this high fat-induced body weight gain and hyperlipidemia through inhibition of lipogenesis and adipokine production and alteration of PPARs expressions.

CONCLUSION: The instant KJ8 and KJ18 rice showed generally similar hypolipidemic and body weight-lowering effects to instant NB and GB rice. These findings demonstrate that instant white rice with added 8% Keunnunjami may be beneficial as functional food with strong hypolipidemic and anti-obesity properties.
26832990	A physiological role of cyclic electron transport around photosystem I in sustaining photosynthesis under fluctuating light in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Plants experience a highly variable light environment over the course of the day. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of their photosynthetic response to fluctuating light, we examined the role of two cyclic electron flows around photosystem I (CEF-PSI)--one depending on PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5) and one on NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)--in photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The impairment of PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI suppressed the photosynthetic response immediately after sudden irradiation, whereas the impairment of NDH-dependent CEF-PSI did not. However, the impairment of either PGR5-dependent or NDH-dependent CEF-PSl reduced the photosynthetic rate under fluctuating light, leading to photoinhibition at PSI and consequently a reduction in plant biomass. The results highlight that (1) PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI is a key regulator of rapid photosynthetic responses to high light intensity under fluctuating light conditions after constant high light; and (2) both PGR5-dependent and NDH-dependent CEF-PSI have physiological roles in sustaining photosynthesis and plant growth in rice under repeated light fluctuations. The highly responsive regulatory system managed by CEF-PSI appears able to optimize photosynthesis and plant growth under naturally fluctuating light conditions.
26873698	A residue substitution in the plastid ribosomal protein L12/AL1 produces defective plastid ribosome and causes early seedling lethality in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	The plastid ribosome is essential for chloroplast biogenesis as well as seedling formation. As the plastid ribosome closely resembles the prokaryotic 70S ribosome, many plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) have been identified in higher plants. However, their assembly in the chloroplast ribosome in rice remains unclear. In the present study, we identified a novel rice mutant, albino lethal 1 (al1), from a chromosome segment substitution line population. The al1 mutant displayed an albino phenotype at the seedling stage and did not survive past the three-leaf stage. No other apparent differences in plant morphology were observed in the al1 mutant. The albino phenotype of the al1 mutant was associated with decreased chlorophyll content and abnormal chloroplast morphology. Using fine mapping, AL1 was shown to encode the PRPL12, a protein localized in the chloroplasts of rice, and a spontaneous single-nucleotide mutation (C/T), resulting in a residue substitution from leucine in AL1 to phenylalanine in al1, was found to be responsible for the early seedling lethality. This point mutation is located at the L10 interface feature of the L12/AL1 protein. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that there was no physical interaction between al1 and PRPL10. In addition, the mutation had little effect on the transcript abundance of al1, but had a remarkable effect on the protein abundance of al1 and transcript abundance of chloroplast biogenesis-related and photosynthesis-related genes. These results provide a first glimpse into the molecular details of L12's function in rice.
26833720	Identification of genes involved in rice seed priming in the early imbibition stage.	2017	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Phase II of seed imbibition is a critical process during seed priming. To identify genes involved in rice seed priming, the altered proteins between the dry and imbibed (24 h) seeds were compared using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system in this study. Ten significantly changed proteins (fold change ≥ twofold; P < 0.01) were successfully identified, which could be categorised as carbohydrate and protein biosynthesis and metabolism-related, signalling-related, storage and stress-related proteins. A meta-analysis indicated that the highest expression of the identified genes was at the milk and dough stages and in the endosperm tissue. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that there was significant variation in gene expression (except FAD-dependent oxidoreductase) in embryos during seed priming (0-48 h). The expression of genes associated with stress appeared at the early imbibition stage, while those associated with carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and signalling increased at the late imbibition stage. Three identified proteins (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunit, aminotransferase and prolamin precursor) had similar transcript and protein expression patterns in embryos. Based on phenotype and gene expression, the optimal stop time for seed priming is 24 h, when these three genes have relatively low expression, followed by significant induction during imbibition in embryos. These three genes are ideal candidate biomarkers for rice seed priming.
26903527	Targeted Knockdown of GDCH in Rice Leads to a Photorespiratory-Deficient Phenotype Useful as a Building Block for C4 Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) plays a critical role in the photorespiratory C2 cycle of C3 species by recovering carbon following the oxygenation reaction of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Loss of GDC from mesophyll cells (MCs) is considered a key early step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. To assess the impact of preferentially reducing GDC in rice MCs, we decreased the abundance of OsGDCH (Os10g37180) using an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) driven by a promoter that preferentially drives expression in MCs. GDC H- and P-proteins were undetectable in leaves of gdch lines. Plants exhibited a photorespiratory-deficient phenotype with stunted growth, accelerated leaf senescence, reduced chlorophyll, soluble protein and sugars, and increased glycine accumulation in leaves. Gas exchange measurements indicated an impaired ability to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in photorespiratory conditions. In addition, MCs of gdch lines exhibited a significant reduction in chloroplast area and coverage of the cell wall when grown in air, traits that occur during the later stages of C4 evolution. The presence of these two traits important for C4 photosynthesis and the non-lethal, down-regulation of the photorespiratory C2 cycle positively contribute to efforts to produce a C4 rice prototype.
26842621	GIPS: A Software Guide to Sequencing-Based Direct Gene Cloning in Forward Genetics Studies.	2016	Plant Physiol	The Gene Identification via Phenotype Sequencing (GIPS) software considers a range of experimental and analysis choices in sequencing-based forward genetics studies within an integrated probabilistic framework, which enables direct gene cloning from the sequencing of several unrelated mutants of the same phenotype without the need to create segregation populations. GIPS estimates four measurements to help optimize an analysis procedure as follows: (1) the chance of reporting the true phenotype-associated gene; (2) the expected number of random genes that may be reported; (3) the significance of each candidate gene's association with the phenotype; and (4) the significance of violating the Mendelian assumption if no gene is reported or if all candidate genes have failed validation. The usage of GIPS is illustrated with the identification of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene that epistatically suppresses the phenotype of the phosphate2 mutant from sequencing three unrelated ethyl methanesulfonate mutants. GIPS is available at https://github.com/synergy-zju/gips/wiki with the user manual and an analysis example.
25639923	Constitutive expression of McCHIT1-PAT enhances resistance to rice blast and herbicide, but does not affect grain yield in transgenic glutinous rice.	None	Biotechnol Appl Biochem	To produce new rice blast- and herbicide-resistant transgenic rice lines, the McCHIT1 gene encoding the class I chitinase from Momordica charantia and the herbicide resistance gene PAT were introduced into Lailong (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica), a glutinous local rice variety from Guizhou Province, People's Republic of China. Transgenic lines were identified by ß-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining, PCR, and Southern blot analyses. Agronomic traits, resistance to rice blast and herbicide, chitinase activities, and transcript levels of McCHIT1 were assessed in the T2 progeny of three transgenic lines (L1, L8, and L10). The results showed that the introduction of McCHIT1-PAT into Lailong significantly enhanced herbicide and blast resistance. After infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, all of the T2 progeny exhibited less severe lesion symptoms than those of wild type. The disease indices were 100% for wild type, 65.66% for T2 transgenic line L1, 59.69% for T2 transgenic line L8, and 79.80% for T2 transgenic line L10. Transgenic lines expressing McCHIT1-PAT did not show a significant difference from wild type in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) content, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the leaves. However, after inoculation with M. oryzae, transgenic plants showed significantly higher SOD and PPO activities and lower MDA contents in leaves, compared with those in wild-type leaves. The transgenic and the wild-type plants did not show significant differences in grain yield parameters including plant height, panicles per plant, seeds per panicle, and 1000-grain weight. Therefore, the transgenic plants showed increased herbicide and blast resistance, with no yield penalty.
26950923	Comparative proteomic analysis of seed embryo proteins associated with seed storability in rice (Oryza sativa L) during natural aging.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Seed storability is considered an important trait in rice breeding; however, the underlying regulating mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we carried out a physiological and proteomic study to identify proteins possibly related to seed storability under natural conditions. Two hybrid cultivars, IIYou998 (IIY998) and BoYou998 (BY998), were analyzed in parallel because they share the same restorer line but have significant differences in seed storability. After a 2-year storage period, the germination percentage of IIY998 was significantly lower than that of BY998, whereas the level of malondialdehyde was reversed, indicating that IIY998 seeds may suffer from more severe damage than BY998 during storage. However, we did not find correlation between activities of antioxidant enzymes of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase and seed storability. We identified 78 embryo proteins in embryo whose abundance varied more than 3-fold different during storage or between IIY998 and BY998. More proteins changed in abundance in IIY998 embryo (67 proteins) during storage than in BY998 (10 proteins). Several redox regulation proteins, mainly glutathione-related proteins, exhibited different degree of change during storage between BY998 and IIY998 and might play an important role protecting embryo proteins from oxidation. In addition, some disease/defense proteins, including DNA-damage-repair/toleration proteins, and a putative late embryogenesis abundant protein were significantly downregulated in IIY998, whereas their levels did not change in BY998, indicating that they might be correlated with seed storability. Further studies on these candidate seed storage proteins might help improve our understanding of seed aging.
26864209	A chloroplast-localized protein LESION AND LAMINA BENDING affects defence and growth responses in rice.	2016	New Phytol	Understanding how plants allocate their resources to growth or defence is of long-term importance to the development of new and improved varieties of different crops. Using molecular genetics, plant physiology, hormone analysis and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based transcript profiling, we have isolated and characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) LESION AND LAMINA BENDING (LLB) gene that encodes a chloroplast-targeted putative leucine carboxyl methyltransferase. Loss of LLB function results in reduced growth and yield, hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions, accumulation of the antimicrobial compounds momilactones and phytocassanes, and constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Consistent with these defence-associated responses, llb shows enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). The lesion and resistance phenotypes are likely to be caused by the over-accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) in the llb mutant including the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. Additionally, llb shows an increased lamina inclination and enhanced early seedling growth due to elevated brassinosteroid (BR) synthesis and/or signalling. These findings show that LLB functions in the chloroplast to either directly or indirectly repress both JA- and BR-mediated responses, revealing a possible mechanism for controlling how plants allocate resources for defence and growth.
26883042	Genetic mapping and molecular marker development for Pi65(t), a novel broad-spectrum resistance gene to rice blast using next-generation sequencing.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A novel R gene was mapped to a locus on chromosome 11 from 30.42 to 30.85 Mb, which was proven to be efficient in the improvement of rice blast resistance. Rice blast is a devastating fungal disease worldwide. The use of blast resistance (R) genes is the most important approach to control the disease in rice breeding. In the present study, we finely mapped a novel resistance gene Pi65(t), conferring a broad-spectrum resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, using bulked segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing technology. Segregation in a doubled haploid (DH) population and a BC1F2 population suggested that resistance to blast in Gangyu129 was likely conferred by a single dominant gene, designated Pi65(t); it was located on chromosome 11 from 30.20 to 31.20 Mb using next-generation sequencing. After screening recombinants with newly developed molecular markers, the region was narrowed down to 0.43 Mb, flanked by SNP-2 and SNP-8 at the physical location from 30.42 to 30.85 Mb based on the Nipponbare reference database in build 5. Using the software QTL IciMapping, Pi65(t) was further mapped to a locus between InDel-1 and SNP-4 with genetic distances of 0.11 and 0.98 cM, respectively. Within this region, 4 predicted R genes were found with nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains. We developed molecular markers to genotype 305 DH lines and found that InDel-1 was closely linked with Pi65(t). Using InDel-1, a new rice variety Chuangxin1 containing Pi65(t) was developed, and it is highly resistant to rice blast and produces a high yield in Liaoning province of China. This indicated that Pi65(t) could play a key role in the improvement of rice blast resistance.
26842722	Molecular cloning of a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich repeat gene from pearl millet and its expression pattern in response to the downy mildew pathogen.	2016	Mol Biol Rep	Downy mildew caused by Sclerospora graminicola is a devastating disease of pearl millet. Based on candidate gene approach, a set of 22 resistance gene analogues were identified. The clone RGPM 301 (AY117410) containing a partial sequence shared 83% similarity to rice R-proteins. A full-length R-gene RGA RGPM 301 of 3552 bp with 2979 bp open reading frame encoding 992 amino acids was isolated by the degenerate primers and rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) approach. It had a molecular mass of 113.96 kDa and isoelectric point (pI) of 8.71. The sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis grouped it to a non-TIR NBS LRR group. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed higher accumulation of the transcripts following inoculation with S. graminicola in the resistant cultivar (IP18296) compared to susceptible cultivar (7042S). Further, significant induction in the transcript levels were observed when treated with abiotic elicitor β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and biotic elicitor Pseudomonas fluorescens. Exogenous application of phytohormones jasmonic acid or salicylic acid also up-regulated the expression levels of RGA RGPM 301. The treatment of cultivar IP18296 with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) suppressed the levels of RGA RGPM 301. A 3.5 kb RGA RGPM 301 which is a non-TIR NBS-LRR protein was isolated from pearl millet and its up-regulation during downy mildew interaction was demonstrated by qRT-PCR. These studies indicate a role for this RGA in pearl millet downy mildew interaction.
26872836	Functional Analysis of a MATE Gene OsFRDL2 Revealed its Involvement in Al-Induced Secretion of Citrate, but a Lower Contribution to Al Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters represent a large transporter family in plants, but the role of most genes in this family has not been examined. We functionally characterized a MATE family member, OsFRDL2, in rice (Oryza sativa). OsFRDL2 showed an efflux transport activity for citrate when it was expressed in both Xenopus oocytes and cultured tobacco cells. OsFRDL2 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not induced by iron (Fe) deficiency, but it was rapidly up-regulated by aluminum (Al). Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance. OsFRDL2 protein was localized at unidentified vesicles in the cytosol, but not co-localized with either mitochondria or peroxisomes when expressed in both onion epidermal cells and cultured tobacco cells. Knockout of OsFRDL2 decreased Al-induced secretion of citrate from the roots, but did not affect the internal citrate concentration. The Al-induced inhibition of root elongation was similar between the OsFRDL2 knockout line and its wild-type rice. Knockout of OsFRDL2 did not affect the translocation of Fe from the roots to the shoots. A double mutant between osfrdl2 and osfrdl4 or osfrdl1 did not further decrease the Al-induced citrate secretion and Fe translocation compared with the single mutant. Collectively, our results indicate that although OsFRDL2 is involved in the Al-induced secretion of citrate, its contribution to high Al tolerance is relatively small in rice.
26977447	Data for global lysine-acetylation analysis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	Data Brief	Rice is one of the most important crops for human consumption and is a staple food for over half of the world׳s population (Yu et al., 2002) [1]. A systematic identification of the lysine acetylome was performed by our research (Xiong et al., 2016) [2]. Rice plant samples were collected from 5 weeks old seedlings (Oryza sativa, Nipponbare). After the trypsin digestion and immunoaffinity precipitation, LC-MS/MS approach was used to identify acetylated peptides. After the collected MS/MS data procession and GO annotation, the InterProScan was used to annotate protein domain. Subcellular localization of the identified acetylated proteins was predicted by WoLF PSORT. The KEGG pathway database was used to annotate identified acetylated protein interactions, reactions, and relations. The data, supplied in this article, are related to "A comprehensive catalog of the lysine-acetylation targets in rice (O. sativa) based on proteomic analyses" by Xiong et al. (2016) [2].
26922355	Genetic and Evolutionary Analysis of Purple Leaf Sheath in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Anthocyanin accumulates in many plant tissues or organs, in rice for example leading to red, purple red and purple phenotypes for protection from damage by biotic and abiotic stresses and for reproduction. Purple leaf, leaf sheath, stigma, pericarp, and apiculus are common in wild rice and landraces and occasionally found in modern cultivars. No gene directly conferring anthocyanin deposited in a purple leaf sheath has yet been isolated by using natural variants. An F2 population derived from ssp. japonica cv. Tainung 72 (TNG72) with purple leaf sheath (PSH) crossed with ssp. indica cv. Taichung Sen 17 (TCS17) with green leaf sheath (GSH) was utilized to isolate a gene conferring leaf sheath color.

RESULTS: By positional cloning, 10-and 3-bp deletions in the R2R3 Myb domain of OsC1 were uncovered in GSH varieties TCS17 and Nipponbare, respectively. Allelic diversity, rather than gene expression levels of OsC1, might be responsible for anthocyanin accumulation. Parsimony-based analysis of genetic diversity in 50 accessions, including cultivars, landraces, and A-genome wild rice, suggests that independent mutation occurred in Asian, African, South American, and Australian species, while O. meridionalis had a divergent sequence. OsC1 was thought of as a domestication related gene, with up to 90 % reduction of genetic diversity in GSH; however, no values from three tests showed significant differences from neutral expectations, implying that OsC1 had not been subjected to recent selection. Haplotype network analysis revealed that species from different continents formed unique haplotypes with no gene flow. Two major groups of haplotypes corresponding to 10-bp deletion and other sequences were formed in Asian rice, including O. rufipogon, O. nivara and O. sativa. Introgressions of OsC1 between subspecies through natural and artificial hybridization were not rare. Because artificial and natural selection imposed admixture on rice germplasm in Taiwan, the genealogy of OsC1 might not be congruent with the current distribution of alleles through lineage diversification.

CONCLUSION: OsC1 is responsible for purple leaf sheath, and much new information about OsC1 is provided e.g., new alleles, non-domestication syndrome, and incongruence of genealogy with geographic distribution.
26864250	W-box and G-box elements play important roles in early senescence of rice flag leaf.	2016	Sci Rep	Plant cis-elements play important roles in global regulation of gene expression. Based on microarray data from rice flag leaves during early senescence, we identified W-box and G-box cis-elements as positive regulators of senescence in the important rice variety Minghui 63. Both cis-elements were bound by leaf senescence-specific proteins in vitro and influenced senescence in vivo. Furthermore, combination of the two elements drove enhanced expression during leaf senescence, and copy numbers of the cis-elements significantly affected the levels of expression. The W-box is the cognate cis-element for WRKY proteins, while the G-box is the cognate cis-element for bZIP, bHLH and NAC proteins. Consistent with this, WRKY, bZIP, bHLH and NAC family members were overrepresented among transcription factor genes up-regulated according during senescence. Crosstalk between ABA, CTK, BR, auxin, GA and JA during senescence was uncovered by comparing expression patterns of senescence up-regulated transcription factors. Together, our results indicate that hormone-mediated signaling could converge on leaf senescence at the transcriptional level through W-box and G-box elements. Considering that there are very few documented early senescence-related cis-elements, our results significantly contribute to understanding the regulation of flag leaf senescence and provide prioritized targets for stay-green trait improvement.
26830331	Loop replacements with gut-binding peptides in Cry1Ab domain II enhanced toxicity against the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).	2016	Sci Rep	Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins have been used widely in pest managements. However, Cry toxins are not effective against sap-sucking insects (Hemiptera), which limits the application of Bt for pest management. In order to extend the insecticidal spectrum of Bt toxins to the rice brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, we modified Cry1Ab putative receptor binding domains with selected BPH gut-binding peptides (GBPs). Three surface exposed loops in the domain II of Cry1Ab were replaced with two GBPs (P2S and P1Z) respectively. Bioassay results showed that toxicity of modified toxin L2-P2S increased significantly (~9 folds) against BPH nymphs. In addition, damage of midgut cells was observed from the nymphs fed with L2-P2S. Our results indicate that modifying Cry toxins based on the toxin-gut interactions can broaden the insecticidal spectrum of Bt toxin. This method provides another approach for the development of transgenic crops with novel insecticidal activity against hemipteran insects and insect populations resistant to current Bt transgenic crops.
26873975	Semi-Rolled Leaf2 modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating abaxial side cell differentiation.	2016	J Exp Bot	Moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes the shadowing between leaves which is helpful to establish ideal plant architecture. Here, we describe asrl2(semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height. Map-based cloning revealed that SRL2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function.SRL2 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells. The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the srl2 mutant. Double mutant analysis suggested that SRL2 and SHALLOT-LIKE1(SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9(RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development. Hence, SRL2 plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.
26907211	Metabolic prediction of important agronomic traits in hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Sci Rep	Hybrid crops have contributed greatly to improvements in global food and fodder production over the past several decades. Nevertheless, the growing population and changing climate have produced food crises and energy shortages. Breeding new elite hybrid varieties is currently an urgent task, but present breeding procedures are time-consuming and labour-intensive. In this study, parental metabolic information was utilized to predict three polygenic traits in hybrid rice. A complete diallel cross population consisting of eighteen rice inbred lines was constructed, and the hybrids' plant height, heading date and grain yield per plant were predicted using 525 metabolites. Metabolic prediction models were built using the partial least square regression method, with predictive abilities ranging from 0.858 to 0.977 for the hybrid phenotypes, relative heterosis, and specific combining ability. Only slight changes in predictive ability were observed between hybrid populations, and nearly no changes were detected between reciprocal hybrids. The outcomes of prediction of the three highly polygenic traits demonstrated that metabolic prediction was an accurate (high predictive abilities) and efficient (unaffected by population genetic structures) strategy for screening promising superior hybrid rice. Exploitation of this pre-hybridization strategy may contribute to rice production improvement and accelerate breeding programs.
26851365	OsGF14e positively regulates panicle blast resistance in rice.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Though GF14e has been reported to negatively regulate bacterial blight and sheath blight resistance in rice, its effect on panicle blast, the most destructive disease in rice is still unknown. In the present study, we identified that GF14e was highly expressed in panicles and was induced in panicles infected by blast pathogen. Overexpression of GF14e enhances resistance to panicle blast whereas silencing GF14e results in increased susceptibility to panicle blast, suggesting that GF14e plays a positive role in quantitative panicle blast resistance in rice. Our results also demonstrate that GF14e is regulated by WRKY71 and GF14e-mediated panicle blast resistance is related to activation of SA-dependent pathway and suppression of JA-dependent pathway. The functional confirmation of GF14e in panicle blast resistance makes it to be a promising target in molecular rice breeding.
26855133	Comparative analysis of gene expression in response to cold stress in diverse rice genotypes.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Cold stress is a major factor affecting rice (Oryza sativa) growth and productivity, limiting its distribution worldwide. Rice production is affected primarily due to its vulnerability to cold stress at seedling stage, as well as reproductive stage leading to spikelet sterility. We report here the analysis of 21 diverse rice genotypes from the USDA mini-core collection for cold tolerance and categorized their tolerance levels on the basis of reduction in growth measured by root and shoot length. The screening identified 12 cold tolerant genotypes from which six tolerant genotypes were characterized at the vegetative stage for cold tolerance and gas-exchange parameters. Two tolerant and two sensitive genotypes were used further for gene expression analysis. Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP) genes showed a clear difference in expression between cold tolerant and sensitive genotypes suggesting that they are good candidates for engineering cold tolerance in rice. Nipponbare was identified as a cold tolerant genotype with stress tolerance mechanism potentially operating via both ABA dependent and independent pathways.
26890603	Ocimum sanctum leaf extract induces drought stress tolerance in rice.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Ocimum leaves are highly enriched in antioxidant components. Thus, its leaf extract, if applied in plants, is believed to efficiently scavenge ROS, thereby preventing oxidative damage under drought stress. Thus, the present study was performed in kharif 2013 and rabi 2014 season to evaluate the effect of aqueous leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum against drought stress in 2 rice genotype under glass house conditions. Here we show that various morpho- physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf rolling score, leaf tip burn, number of senesced leaves and total dry matter) and biochemical parameters (proline, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase content) were amended by Ocimum treatment in both the seasons. Application of Ocimum extract increased expression of dehydrin genes, while reducing expression of aquaporin genes in drought stressed rice plant. Thus, application of Ocimum leaf extract under drought stress can be suggested as a promising strategy to mitigate drought stress in economical, accessible and ecofriendly manner.
26741538	Reduced arsenic accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) shoot involves sulfur mediated improved thiol metabolism, antioxidant system and altered arsenic transporters.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Arsenic (As) contamination in rice is at alarming level as majority of rice growing regions are As contaminated such as South East Asia. Restricting the As in aerial parts of rice plant may be an effective strategy to reduce As contamination in food chain. Sulfur (S), an essential element for plant growth and development, plays a crucial role in diminishing heavy metal toxicity. Current study is designed to investigate the role of S to mitigate As toxicity in rice under different S regimes. High S (5 mM) treatment resulted in enhanced root As accumulation as well as prevented its entry in to shoot. Results of thiol metabolism indicate that As was complexed in plant roots through enhanced synthesis of phytochelatins. High S treatment also reduced the expression of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, the potent transporters of As in rice. High S treatment enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and mitigated the As induced oxidative stress. Thus from present study it is evident that proper supply of S nutrition may be helpful in prevention of As accumulation in aerial parts of plant as well as As induced toxicity.
26841834	Genome-wide association and high-resolution phenotyping link Oryza sativa panicle traits to numerous trait-specific QTL clusters.	2016	Nat Commun	Rice panicle architecture is a key target of selection when breeding for yield and grain quality. However, panicle phenotypes are difficult to measure and susceptible to confounding during genetic mapping due to correlation with flowering and subpopulation structure. Here we quantify 49 panicle phenotypes in 242 tropical rice accessions with the imaging platform PANorama. Using flowering as a covariate, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS), detect numerous subpopulation-specific associations, and dissect multi-trait peaks using panicle phenotype covariates. Ten candidate genes in pathways known to regulate plant architecture fall under GWAS peaks, half of which overlap with quantitative trait loci identified in an experimental population. This is the first study to assess inflorescence phenotypes of field-grown material using a high-resolution phenotyping platform. Herein, we establish a panicle morphocline for domesticated rice, propose a genetic model underlying complex panicle traits, and demonstrate subtle links between panicle size and yield performance.
26758024	Association mapping of germinability and seedling vigor in sorghum under controlled low-temperature conditions.	2016	Genome	Sorghum is one of the world's most important food, feed, and fiber crops as well as a potential feedstock for lignocellulosic bioenergy. Early-season planting extends sorghum's growing season and increases yield in temperate regions. However, sorghum's sensitivity to low soil temperatures adversely impacts seed germination. In this study, we evaluated the 242 accessions of the ICRISAT sorghum mini core collection for seed germination and seedling vigor at 12 °C as a measure of cold tolerance. Genome-wide association analysis was performed with approximately 162,177 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Only one marker locus (Locus 7-2) was significantly associated with low-temperature germination and none with vigor. The linkage of Locus 7-2 to low-temperature germination was supported by four lines of evidence: strong association in three independent experiments, co-localization with previously mapped cold tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTL) in sorghum, a candidate gene that increases cold tolerance and germination rate when its wheat homolog is overexpressed in tobacco, and its syntenic region in rice co-localized with two cold tolerance QTL in rice. This locus may be useful in developing tools for molecular breeding of sorghums with improved low-temperature germinability.
26910860	Control of foreign polypeptide localization in specific layers of protein body type I in rice seed.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Prolamin-GFP fusion proteins, expressed under the control of native prolamin promoters, were localized in specific layers of PB-Is. Prolamin-GFP fusion proteins were gradually digested from outside by pepsin digestion. In rice seed endosperm, protein body type I (PB-I) has a layered structure consisting of prolamin species and is the resistant to digestive juices in the intestinal tract. We propose the utilization of PB-Is as an oral vaccine carrier to induce mucosal immune response effectively. If vaccine antigens are localized in a specific layer within PB-Is, they could be protected from gastric juice and be delivered intact to the small intestine. We observed the localization of GFP fluorescence in transgenic rice endosperm expressing prolamin-GFP fusion proteins with native prolamin promoters, and we confirmed that the foreign proteins were located in specific layers of PB-Is artificially. Each prolamin-GFP fusion protein was localized in specific layers of PB-Is, such as the outer-most layer, middle layer, and core region. Furthermore, to investigate the resistance of prolamin-GFP fusion proteins against pepsin digestion, we performed in vitro pepsin treatment. Prolamin-GFP fusion proteins were gradually digested from the peripheral region and the contours of PB-Is were made rough by in vitro pepsin treatment. These findings suggested that prolamin-GFP fusion proteins accumulating specific layers of PB-Is were gradually digested and exposed from the outside by pepsin digestion.
26942914	Combination of Eight Alleles at Four Quantitative Trait Loci Determines Grain Length in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Grain length is an important quantitative trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.) that influences both grain yield and exterior quality. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain length have been identified, it is still unclear how different alleles from different QTLs regulate grain length coordinately. To explore the mechanisms of QTL combination in the determination of grain length, five mapping populations, including two F2 populations, an F3 population, an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and an F8 RIL population, were developed from the cross between the U.S. tropical japonica variety 'Lemont' and the Chinese indica variety 'Yangdao 4' and grown under different environmental conditions. Four QTLs (qGL-3-1, qGL-3-2, qGL-4, and qGL-7) for grain length were detected using both composite interval mapping and multiple interval mapping methods in the mapping populations. In each locus, there was an allele from one parent that increased grain length and another allele from another parent that decreased it. The eight alleles in the four QTLs were analyzed to determine whether these alleles act additively across loci, and lead to a linear relationship between the predicted breeding value of QTLs and phenotype. Linear regression analysis suggested that the combination of eight alleles determined grain length. Plants carrying more grain length-increasing alleles had longer grain length than those carrying more grain length-decreasing alleles. This trend was consistent in all five mapping populations and demonstrated the regulation of grain length by the four QTLs. Thus, these QTLs are ideal resources for modifying grain length in rice.
27092937	A Missense Mutation in the Zinc Finger Domain of OsCESA7 Deleteriously Affects Cellulose Biosynthesis and Plant Growth in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Rice is a model plant species for the study of cellulose biosynthesis. We isolated a mutant, S1-24, from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated plants of the japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. The mutant exhibited brittle culms and other pleiotropic phenotypes such as dwarfism and partial sterility. The brittle culms resulted from reduced mechanical strength due to a defect in thickening of the sclerenchyma cell wall and reduced cellulose content in the culms of the S1-24 mutant. Map-based gene cloning and a complementation assay showed that phenotypes of the S1-24 mutant were caused by a recessive point mutation in the OsCESA7 gene, which encodes cellulose synthase A subunit 7. The missense mutation changed the highly conserved C40 to Y in the zinc finger domain. The OsCESA7 gene is expressed predominantly in the culm at the mature stage, particularly in mechanical tissues such as vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm. These results indicate that OsCESA7 plays an important role in cellulose biosynthesis and plant growth.
26834769	Heme Oxygenase-1 Delays Gibberellin-Induced Programmed Cell Death of Rice Aleurone Layers Subjected to Drought Stress by Interacting with Nitric Oxide.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Cereal aleurone layers undergo a gibberellin (GA)-regulated process of programmed cell death (PCD) following germination. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is known as a rate-liming enzyme in the degradation of heme to biliverdin IXα, carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron ions (Fe(2+)). It is a critical component in plant development and adaptation to environment stresses. Our previous studies confirmed that HO-1 inducer hematin (Ht) promotes the germination of rice seeds in drought (20% polyethylene glycol-6000, PEG) conditions, but the corresponding effects of HO-1 on the alleviation of germination-triggered PCD in GA-treated rice aleurone layers remain unknown. The present study has determined that GA co-treated with PEG results in lower HO-1 transcript levels and HO activity, which in turn results in the development of vacuoles in aleurone cells, followed by PCD. The pharmacology approach illustrated that up- or down-regulated HO-1 gene expression and HO activity delayed or accelerated GA-induced PCD. Furthermore, the application of the HO-1 inducer Ht and nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) not only activated HO-1 gene expression, HO activity, and endogenous NO content, but also blocked GA-induced rapid vacuolation and accelerated aleurone layers PCD under drought stress. However, both HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) and NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl0-4, 4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-l-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO) reserved the effects of Ht and SNP on rice aleurone layer PCD under drought stress by down-regulating endogenous HO-1 and NO, respectively. The inducible effects of Ht and SNP on HO-1 gene expression, HO activity, and NO content were blocked by cPTIO. Together, these results clearly suggest that HO-1 is involved in the alleviation of GA-induced PCD of drought-triggered rice aleurone layers by associating with NO.
26792122	Amyloplast Membrane Protein SUBSTANDARD STARCH GRAIN6 Controls Starch Grain Size in Rice Endosperm.	2016	Plant Physiol	Starch is a biologically and commercially important polymer of glucose. Starch is organized into starch grains (SGs) inside amyloplasts. The SG size differs depending on the plant species and is one of the most important factors for industrial applications of starch. There is limited information on genetic factors regulating SG sizes. In this study, we report the rice (Oryza sativa) mutant substandard starch grain6 (ssg6), which develops enlarged SGs in endosperm. Enlarged SGs are observed starting at 3 d after flowering. During endosperm development, a number of smaller SGs appear and coexist with enlarged SGs in the same cells. The ssg6 mutation also affects SG morphologies in pollen. The SSG6 gene was identified by map-based cloning and microarray analysis. SSG6 encodes a protein homologous to aminotransferase. SSG6 differs from other rice homologs in that it has a transmembrane domain. SSG6-green fluorescent protein is localized in the amyloplast membrane surrounding SGs in rice endosperm, pollen, and pericarp. The results of this study suggest that SSG6 is a novel protein that controls SG size. SSG6 will be a useful molecular tool for future starch breeding and applications.
27186018	Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of commercially elite rice restorer line using nptII gene as a plant selection marker.	2016	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Transformation of commercially important indica cultivars remains challenging for the scientific community even though Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocols for a few indica rice lines have been well established. We report successful transformation of a commercially important restorer line JK1044R of indica rice hybrid JKRH 401. While following existing protocol, we optimized several parameters for callusing, regeneration and genetic transformation of JK1044R. Calli generated from the rice scutellum tissue were used for transformation by Agrobacterium harboring pCAMBIA2201. A novel two tire selection scheme comprising of Geneticin (G418) and Paramomycin were deployed for selection of transgenic calli as well as regenerated plantlets that expressed neomycin phosphotransferase-II gene encoded by the vector. One specific combination of G418 (30 mg l(-1)) and Paramomycin (70 mg l(-1)) was very effective for calli selection. Transformed and selected calli were detected by monitoring the expression of the reporter gene uidA (GUS). Regenerated plantlets were confirmed through PCR analysis of nptII and gus genes specific primers as well as dot blot using gus gene specific as probe.
26810156	Genome-wide association mapping revealed a diverse genetic basis of seed dormancy across subpopulations in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait employed by flowering plants to avoid harsh environmental conditions for the continuity of their next generations. In cereal crops, moderate seed dormancy could help prevent pre-harvest sprouting and improve grain yield and quality. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) for dormancy, based on seed germination percentage (GP) in freshly harvested seeds (FHS) and after-ripened seeds (ARS) in 350 worldwide accessions that were characterized with strong population structure of indica, japonica and Aus subpopulations.

RESULTS: The germination tests revealed that Aus and indica rice had stronger seed dormancy than japonica rice in FHS. Association analysis revealed 16 loci significantly associated with GP in FHS and 38 in ARS. Three out of the 38 loci detected in ARS were also detected in FHS and 13 of the ARS loci were detected near previously mapped dormancy QTL. In FHS, three of the association loci were located within 100 kb around previously cloned GA/IAA inactivation genes such as GA2ox3, EUI1 and GH3-2 and one near dormancy gene, Sdr4. In ARS, an association signal was detected near ABA signaling gene ABI5. No association peaks were commonly detected among the sub-populations in FHS and only one association peak was detected in both indica and japonica populations in ARS. Sdr4 and GA2OX3 haplotype analysis showed that Aus and indica II (IndII) varieties had stronger dormancy alleles whereas indica I (IndI) and japonica had weak or non-dormancy alleles.

CONCLUSION: The association study and haplotype analysis together, indicate an involvement of independent genes and alleles contributing towards regulation and natural variation of seed dormancy among the rice sub-populations.
26760761	Production of Biologically Active Cecropin A Peptide in Rice Seed Oil Bodies.	2016	PLoS One	Cecropin A is a natural antimicrobial peptide that exhibits fast and potent activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens and neoplastic cells, and that has important biotechnological applications. However, cecropin A exploitation, as for other antimicrobial peptides, is limited by their production and purification costs. Here, we report the efficient production of this bioactive peptide in rice bran using the rice oleosin 18 as a carrier protein. High cecropin A levels were reached in rice seeds driving the expression of the chimeric gene by the strong embryo-specific oleosin 18 own promoter, and targeting the peptide to the oil body organelle as an oleosin 18-cecropin A fusion protein. The accumulation of cecropin A in oil bodies had no deleterious effects on seed viability and seedling growth, as well as on seed yield. We also show that biologically active cecropin A can be easily purified from the transgenic rice seeds by homogenization and simple flotation centrifugation methods. Our results demonstrate that the oleosin fusion technology is suitable for the production of cecropin A in rice seeds, which can potentially be extended to other antimicrobial peptides to assist their exploitation.
26934377	Flowering-Related RING Protein 1 (FRRP1) Regulates Flowering Time and Yield Potential by Affecting Histone H2B Monoubiquitination in Rice (Oryza Sativa).	2016	PLoS One	Flowering time is a critical trait for crops cultivated under various temperature/photoperiod conditions around the world. To understand better the flowering time of rice, we used the vector pTCK303 to produce several lines of RNAi knockdown transgenic rice and investigated their flowering times and other agronomic traits. Among them, the heading date of FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice was 23-26 days earlier than that of wild-type plants. FRRP1 is a novel rice gene that encodes a C3HC4-type Really Interesting Novel Gene (RING) finger domain protein. In addition to the early flowering time, FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice caused changes on an array of agronomic traits, including plant height, panicle length and grain length. We analyzed the expression of some key genes associated with the flowering time and other agronomic traits in the FRRP1-RNAi knockdown lines and compared with that in wild-type lines. The expression of Hd3a increased significantly, which was the key factor in the early flowering time. Further experiments showed that the level of histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) was noticeably reduced in the FRRP1-RNAi knockdown transgenic rice lines compared with wild-type plants and MBP-FRRP1-F1 was capable of self-ubiquitination. The results indicate that Flowering Related RING Protein 1 (FRRP1) is involved in histone H2B monoubiquitination and suggest that FRRP1 functions as an E3 ligase in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, FRRP1 probably regulates flowering time and yield potential in rice by affecting histone H2B monoubiquitination, which leads to changes in gene expression in multiple processes.
26943337	Genome-Wide Analysis of the AP2/ERF Gene Family in Physic Nut and Overexpression of the JcERF011 Gene in Rice Increased Its Sensitivity to Salinity Stress.	2016	PLoS One	The AP2/ERF transcription factors play crucial roles in plant growth, development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. A total of 119 AP2/ERF genes (JcAP2/ERFs) have been identified in the physic nut genome; they include 16 AP2, 4 RAV, 1 Soloist, and 98 ERF genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that physic nut AP2 genes could be divided into 3 subgroups, while ERF genes could be classed into 11 groups or 43 subgroups. The AP2/ERF genes are non-randomly distributed across the 11 linkage groups of the physic nut genome and retain many duplicates which arose from ancient duplication events. The expression patterns of several JcAP2/ERF duplicates in the physic nut showed differences among four tissues (root, stem, leaf, and seed), and 38 JcAP2/ERF genes responded to at least one abiotic stressor (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation, and nitrogen starvation) in leaves and/or roots according to analysis of digital gene expression tag data. The expression of JcERF011 was downregulated by salinity stress in physic nut roots. Overexpression of the JcERF011 gene in rice plants increased its sensitivity to salinity stress. The increased expression levels of several salt tolerance-related genes were impaired in the JcERF011-overexpressing plants under salinity stress.
26818269	Marker assisted pyramiding of drought yield QTLs into a popular Malaysian rice cultivar, MR219.	2016	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Three drought yield QTLs, qDTY 2.2, qDTY 3.1, and qDTY 12.1 with consistent effect on grain yield under reproductive stage drought stress were pyramided through marker assisted breeding with the objective of improving the grain yield of the elite Malaysian rice cultivar MR219 under reproductive stage drought stress. Foreground selection using QTL specific markers, recombinant selection using flanking markers, and background selection were performed. BC1F3-derived lines with different combinations of qDTY 2.2 , qDTY 3.1, and qDTY 12.1 were evaluated under both reproductive stage drought stress and non-stress during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014 at IRRI.

RESULTS: The grain yield reductions in the stress trials compared to non-stress trials ranged from 79 to 93%. In the stress trials, delay in days to flowering and reduction in plant height were observed. In both seasons, MR219 did not produce any yield under stress, however it produced a yield of 5917 kg ha(-1) during the 2013 dry season and 8319 kg ha(-1) during the 2014 dry season under non-stress. Selected introgressed lines gave a yield advantage of 903 to 2500 kg ha(-1) over MR219 under reproductive stage drought stress and a yield of more than 6900 kg ha(-1) under non-stress during the 2014 dry season. Among lines with single qDTY, lines carrying qDTY 2.2 provided a higher yield advantage under reproductive stage drought stress in the MR219 background. Two-qDTY combinations (qDTY 3.1+ qDTY 2.2 and qDTY 3.1+ qDTY 12.1) performed better than lines with three qDTY combinations, indicating the absence of positive interactions between the three qDTYs.

CONCLUSION: We successfully developed drought-tolerant MR219 pyramided lines with a yield advantage of more than 1500 kg ha(-1). Differential yield advantages of different combinations of the qDTYs indicate a differential synergistic relationship among qDTYs. This is the first report on the successful effect of qDTYs in increasing the yield under drought in genetic backgrounds other than those in which the qDTYs were earlier identified.
27186017	Genome- wide characterization of Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) gene family of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]: a bioinformatics approach.	2016	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor (TF) complex with preferential binding to CCAAT elements of promoters, regulating gene expression in most of the higher eukaryotes. The availability of plant genome sequences have revealed multiple number of genes coding for the three subunits, namely NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC in contrast to single NF-Y gene for each subunit reported in yeast and animals. A total of 33 NF-YTF comprising of 8 NF-YA, 11 NF-YB and 14 NF-YC subunits were accessed from the sorghum genome. The bioinformatic characterization of NF-Y gene family of sorghum for gene structure, chromosome location, protein motif, phylogeny, gene duplication and in-silico expression under abiotic stresses have been attempted in the present study. The identified SbNF-Y genes are distributed on all the 10 chromosomes of sorghum with variability in the frequency and 18 out of 33 SbNF-Ys were found to be intronless. Segmental duplication event was found to be predominant feature based on gene duplication pattern study. Several orthologs and paralogs groups were disclosed through the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SbNF-Y proteins along with 36 Arabidopsis and 28 rice NF-Y proteins. In-silico expression analysis under abiotic stresses using rice transcriptome data revealed several of the sorghum NF-Y genes to be associated with salt, drought, cold and heat stresses.
26803502	Constitutive expression of CaPLA1 conferred enhanced growth and grain yield in transgenic rice plants.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Phospholipids are not only important components of cell membranes, but participate in diverse processes in higher plants. In this study, we generated Capsicum annuum phospholipiase A1 (CaPLA1) overexpressing transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. The T4 CaPLA1-overexpressing rice plants (Ubi:CaPLA1) had a higher root:shoot mass ratio than the wild-type plants in the vegetative stage. Leaf epidermal cells from transgenic plants had more cells than wild-type plants. Genes that code for cyclin and lipid metabolic enzymes were up-regulated in the transgenic lines. When grown under typical paddy field conditions, the transgenic plants produced more tillers, longer panicles and more branches per panicle than the wild-type plants, all of which resulted in greater grain yield. Microarray analysis suggests that gene expressions that are related with cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, and redox state were widely altered in CaPLA1-overexpressing transgenic rice plants. Ubi:CaPLA1 plants had a reduced membrane peroxidation state, as determined by malondialdehyde and conjugated diene levels and higher peroxidase activity than wild-type rice plants. Furthermore, three isoprenoid synthetic genes encoding terpenoid synthase, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase were up-regulated in CaPLA1-overexpressing plants. We suggest that constitutive expression of CaPLA1 conferred increased grain yield with enhanced growth in transgenic rice plants by alteration of gene activities related with cell proliferation, lipid metabolism, membrane peroxidation state and isoprenoid biosynthesis.
26781660	Landscape and evolutionary dynamics of terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature in plant genomes.	2016	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: Terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIMs) are a unique group of small long terminal repeat retrotransposons that are difficult to identify. Thus far, only a few TRIMs have been characterized in the euphyllophytes, and their evolutionary and biological significance as well as their transposition mechanisms are poorly understood.

RESULTS: Using a combination of de novo and homology-based methods, we annotate TRIMs in 48 plant genome sequences, spanning land plants to algae. The TRIMs are grouped into 156 families including 145 that were previously undefined. Notably, we identify the first TRIMs in a lycophyte and non-vascular plants. The majority of the TRIM families are highly conserved and shared within and between plant families. Unlike other long terminal repeat retrotransposons, TRIMs are enriched in or near genes; they are also targeted by sRNAs between 21 and 24 nucleotides in length, and are frequently found in CG body-methylated genes. Importantly, we also identify putative autonomous retrotransposons and very recent transpositions of a TRIM element in Oryza sativa.

CONCLUSIONS: We perform the most comprehensive analysis of TRIM transposons thus far and report that TRIMs are ubiquitous across plant genomes. Our results show that TRIMs are more frequently associated with large and CG body-methylated genes that have undergone strong purifying selection. Our findings also indicate that TRIMs are likely derived from internal deletions of large long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Finally, our data and methodology are important resources for the characterization and evolutionary and genomic studies of long terminal repeat retrotransposons in other genomes.
26834778	Enhanced Salt Tolerance Conferred by the Complete 2.3 kb cDNA of the Rice Vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) Antiporter Gene Compared to 1.9 kb Coding Region with 5' UTR in Transgenic Lines of Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Soil salinity is one of the most challenging problems that restricts the normal growth and production of rice worldwide. It has therefore become very important to produce more saline tolerant rice varieties. This study shows constitutive over-expression of the vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (OsNHX1) from the rice landrace (Pokkali) and attainment of enhanced level of salinity tolerance in transgenic rice plants. It also shows that inclusion of the complete un-translated regions (UTRs) of the alternatively spliced OsNHX1 gene provides a higher level of tolerance to the transgenic rice. Two separate transformation events of the OsNHX1 gene, one with 1.9 kb region containing the 5' UTR with CDS and the other of 2.3 kb, including 5' UTR, CDS, and the 3' UTR regions were performed. The transgenic plants with these two different constructs were advanced to the T3 generation and physiological and molecular screening of homozygous plants was conducted at seedling and reproductive stages under salinity (NaCl) stress. Both transgenic lines were observed to be tolerant compared to WT plants at both physiological stages. However, the transgenic lines containing the CDS with both the 5' and 3' UTR were significantly more tolerant compared to the transgenic lines containing OsNHX1 gene without the 3' UTR. At the seedling stage at 12 dS/m stress, the chlorophyll content was significantly higher (P < 0.05) and the electrolyte leakage significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the order 2.3 kb > 1.9 kb > and WT lines. Yield in g/plant in the best line from the 2.3 kb plants was significantly more (P < 0.01) compared, respectively, to the best 1.9 kb line and WT plants at stress of 6 dS/m. Transformation with the complete transcripts rather than the CDS may therefore provide more durable level of tolerance.
26747130	Over-expression of Arabidopsis thaliana SFD1/GLY1, the gene encoding plastid localized glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, increases plastidic lipid content in transgenic rice plants.	2016	J Plant Res	Lipids are the major constituents of all membranous structures in plants. Plants possess two pathways for lipid biosynthesis: the prokaryotic pathway (i.e., plastidic pathway) and the eukaryotic pathway (i.e., endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) pathway). Whereas some plants synthesize galactolipids from diacylglycerol assembled in the plastid, others, including rice, derive their galactolipids from diacylglycerols assembled by the eukaryotic pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pDH), coded by SUPPRESSOR OF FATTY ACID DESATURASE 1 (SFD1; alias GLY1) gene, catalyzes the formation of glycerol 3-phosphate (G3p), the backbone of many membrane lipids. Here SFD1 was introduced to rice as a transgene. Arabidopsis SFD1 localizes in rice plastids and its over-expression increases plastidic membrane lipid content in transgenic rice plants without any major impact on ER lipids. The results suggest that over-expression of plastidic G3pDH enhances biosynthesis of plastid-localized lipids in rice. Lipid composition in the transgenic plants is consistent with increased phosphatidylglycerol synthesis in the plastid and increased galactolipid synthesis from diacylglycerol produced via the ER pathway. The transgenic plants show a higher photosynthetic assimilation rate, suggesting a possible application of this finding in crop improvement.
26803790	Higher concentrations of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) in soil induced rice chlorosis due to inhibited active iron transportation.	2016	Environ Pollut	In this study, the effects of concentrations 0, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg kg(-1) of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) on germination, seedlings growth, physiology and toxicity mechanisms were investigated. The results showed that nZVI had no effect on germination, but inhibited the rice seedlings growth in higher concentrations (>500 mg kg(-1) nZVI). The highest suppression rate of the length of roots and shoots reached 46.9% and 57.5%, respectively. The 1000mg kg(-1) nZVI caused the highest suppression rates for chlorophyll and carotenoids, at 91.6% and 85.2%, respectively. In addition, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was altered by the translocation of nanoparticles and changes in active iron content. Visible symptoms of iron deficiency were observed at higher concentrations, at which the active iron content decreased 61.02% in the shoots, but the active iron content not decreased in roots. Interestingly, the total and available amounts of iron in the soil were not less than those in the control. Therefore, the plants iron deficiency was not caused by (i) deficiency of available iron in the soil and (ii) restraint of the absorption that plant takes in the available iron, while induced by (ⅲ) the transport of active iron from the root to the shoot was blocked. The cortex tissues were seriously damaged by nZVI which was transported from soil to the root, these were proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). This current study shows that the mechanism of iron deficiency in rice seedling was due to transport of active iron from the root to the shoot blocked, which was caused by the uptake of nZVI.
27186024	Assessment of genetic diversity of Saltol QTL among the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes.	2016	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Eight Saltol quantitative trait locus (QTL) linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were used to study the polymorphism of this QTL in 142 diverse rice genotypes that comprised salt tolerant as well as sensitive genotypes. The SSR profiles of the eight markers generated 99 alleles including 20rare alleles and 16 null alleles. RM8094 showed the highest number (13) of alleles followed by RM3412 (12), RM562 (11), RM493 (9) and RM1287 (8) while as, RM10764 and RM10745 showed the lowest number (6) of alleles. Based on the highest number of alleles and PIC value (0.991), we identified RM8094 as suitable marker for discerning salt tolerant genotypes from the sensitive ones. Based upon the haplotype analysis using FL478 as a reference (salt tolerant genotypes containing Saltol QTL), we short listed 68 rice genotypes that may have at least one allele of FL478 haplotype. Further study may confirm that some of these genotypes might have Saltol QTL and can be used as alternative donors in salt tolerant rice breeding programmes.
26973685	Functional Characterization of Novel Chitinase Genes Present in the Sheath Blight Resistance QTL: qSBR11-1 in Rice Line Tetep.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice sheath blight disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastating diseases in rice leading to heavy yield losses. Due to the polygenic nature of resistance, no major resistance gene with complete host resistance against R. solani has been reported. In this study, we have performed molecular and functional analysis of the genes associated with the major R. solani-resistance QTL qSBR11-1 in the indica rice line Tetep. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a set of 11 tandem repeats containing genes with a high degree of homology to class III chitinase defense response genes. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that all the genes are strongly induced 36 h after R. solani infection. Comparison between the resistant Tetep and the susceptible HP2216 lines shows that the induction of the chitinase genes is much higher in the Tetep line. Recombinant protein produced in vitro for six of the eleven genes showed chitinolytic activity in gel assays but we did not detect any xylanase inhibitory activity. All the six in vitro expressed proteins show antifungal activity with a clear inhibitory effect on the growth of the R. solani mycelium. The characterized chitinase genes can provide an important resource for the genetic improvement of R. solani susceptible rice lines for sheath blight resistance breeding.
27200064	Identification of a Candidate Gene for Panicle Length in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Via Association and Linkage Analysis.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Panicle length (PL) is an important trait for improving panicle architecture and grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Three populations were used to identify QTLs and candidate genes associated with PL. Four QTLs for PL were detected on chromosomes 4, 6, and 9 through linkage mapping in the recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the cultivars Xiushui79 (short panicle) and C-bao (long panicle). Ten SSR markers associated with PL were detected on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 in the natural population consisting of 540 accessions collected from East and Southeast Asia. A major locus on chromosome 9 with the largest effect was identified via both linkage and association mapping. LONG PANICLE 1 (LP1) locus was delimited to a 90-kb region of the long arm of chromosome 9 through fine mapping using a single segment segregating F2 population. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to amino acid changes were detected in the third and fifth exons of LP1. LP1 encodes a Remorin_C-containing protein of unknown function with homologs in a variety of species. Sequencing analysis of LP1 in two parents and 103 rice accessions indicated that SNP1 is associated with panicle length. The LP1 allele of Xiushui79 leads to reduced panicle length, whereas the allele of C-bao relieves the suppression of panicle length. LP1 and the elite alleles can be used to improve panicle length in rice.
27116122	Enhanced Rice Blast Resistance by CRISPR/Cas9-Targeted Mutagenesis of the ERF Transcription Factor Gene OsERF922.	2016	PLoS One	Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases affecting rice worldwide. The adoption of host resistance has proven to be the most economical and effective approach to control rice blast. In recent years, sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for the improvement of crops via gene-specific genome editing, and CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most effective SSN. Here, we report the improvement of rice blast resistance by engineering a CRISPR/Cas9 SSN (C-ERF922) targeting the OsERF922 gene in rice. Twenty-one C-ERF922-induced mutant plants (42.0%) were identified from 50 T0 transgenic plants. Sanger sequencing revealed that these plants harbored various insertion or deletion (InDel) mutations at the target site. We showed that all of the C-ERF922-induced allele mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations. Mutant plants harboring the desired gene modification but not containing the transferred DNA were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. Six T2 homozygous mutant lines were further examined for a blast resistance phenotype and agronomic traits, such as plant height, flag leaf length and width, number of productive panicles, panicle length, number of grains per panicle, seed setting percentage and thousand seed weight. The results revealed that the number of blast lesions formed following pathogen infection was significantly decreased in all 6 mutant lines compared with wild-type plants at both the seedling and tillering stages. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between any of the 6 T2 mutant lines and the wild-type plants with regard to the agronomic traits tested. We also simultaneously targeted multiple sites within OsERF922 by using Cas9/Multi-target-sgRNAs (C-ERF922S1S2 and C-ERF922S1S2S3) to obtain plants harboring mutations at two or three sites. Our results indicate that gene modification via CRISPR/Cas9 is a useful approach for enhancing blast resistance in rice.
26772883	Involvement of rice histone deacetylase HDA705 in seed germination and in response to ABA and abiotic stresses.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Histone acetylation and deacetylation play crucial roles in the modification of chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) assist to maintain the balance of chromatin acetylation status. Previous studies showed that plant HDACs are key regulators involved in response to development and stresses. In this study, we examined the expression pattern and function of HDA705, a member of the RPD3/HDA1-type HDAC in rice. Overexpression of HDA705 in rice decreased ABA and salt stress resistance during seed germination. Delayed seed germination of HDA705 overexpression lines was associated with down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes and up-regulation of ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, overexpression of HDA705 in rice enhanced osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage. Our findings demonstrate that HDA705 may play a role in regulating seed germination and the response to abiotic stresses in rice.
26819544	Structural Diversity of a Novel LTR Retrotransposon, RTPOSON, in the Genus Oryza.	2016	Evol Bioinform Online	Retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTRs) are the most abundant transposable elements in plant genomes. A novel LTR retrotransposon named RTPOSON primarily occurs in the genus Oryza and in several species of the Poaceae family. RTPOSON has been identified in the Ty1-copia group of retrotransposons because two of its open reading frames encode an uncharacterized protein and UBN2_2 and zinc knuckle, respectively. More than 700 RTPOSONs were identified in Oryza genomes; 127 RTPOSONs with LTRs and gag-pol elements were classified into three subgroups. The subgroup RTPOSON_sub3 had the smallest DNA size and 97% (32/33) of RTPOSON elements from Oryza punctata are classified in this group. The insertion time of these RTPOSONs varied and their proliferation occurred within the last 8 Mya, with two bursting periods within the last 1.5-5.0 Mya. A total of 37 different orthologous insertions of RTPOSONs, with different nested transposable elements and gene fragments, were identified by comparing the genomes of ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare and ssp. indica cv. 93-11. A part of intact RTPOSON elements was evolved independently after the divergence of indica and japonica. In addition, intact RTPOSONs and homologous fragments were preferentially retained or integrated in genic regions. This novel LTR retrotransposon, RTPOSON, might have an impact on genome evolution, genic innovation, and genetic variation.
27124767	Comprehensive Mitochondrial Metabolic Shift during the Critical Node of Seed Ageing in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	The critical node (CN) in seed aging in rice (Oryza sativa) is the transformation from Phase I (P-I) to Phase II (P-II) of the reverse S-shaped curve (RS-SC). Although mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in seed ageing, the metabolic shift in the CN remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms during the CN of rice seed ageing. We showed that during the CN of seed ageing, the mitochondrial ultrastructure was impaired, causing oxygen consumption to decrease, along with cytochrome c (cyt c) oxidase and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. In addition, the transcript levels for the alternative pathway of the electron transport chain (ETC) were significantly induced, whereas the transcripts of the cytochrome oxidase (COX) pathway were inhibited. These changes were concomitant with the down-regulation of mitochondrial protein levels related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism, ATP synthase (ATPase) complex, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, mitochondrial oxidative enzymes, and a variety of other proteins. Therefore, while these responses inhibit the production of ATP and its intermediates, signals from mitochondria (such as the decrease of cyt c and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)) may also induce oxidative damage. These events provide considerable information about the mitochondrial metabolic shifts involved in the progression of seed ageing in the CN.
26799713	Development of a RAD-Seq Based DNA Polymorphism Identification Software, AgroMarker Finder, and Its Application in Rice Marker-Assisted Breeding.	2016	PLoS One	Rapid and accurate genome-wide marker detection is essential to the marker-assisted breeding and functional genomics studies. In this work, we developed an integrated software, AgroMarker Finder (AMF: http://erp.novelbio.com/AMF), for providing graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the recently developed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing data analysis in rice. By application of AMF, a total of 90,743 high-quality markers (82,878 SNPs and 7,865 InDels) were detected between rice varieties JP69 and Jiaoyuan5A. The density of the identified markers is 0.2 per Kb for SNP markers, and 0.02 per Kb for InDel markers. Sequencing validation revealed that the accuracy of genome-wide marker detection by AMF is 93%. In addition, a validated subset of 82 SNPs and 31 InDels were found to be closely linked to 117 important agronomic trait genes, providing a basis for subsequent marker-assisted selection (MAS) and variety identification. Furthermore, we selected 12 markers from 31 validated InDel markers to identify seed authenticity of variety Jiaoyuanyou69, and we also identified 10 markers closely linked to the fragrant gene BADH2 to minimize linkage drag for Wuxiang075 (BADH2 donor)/Jiachang1 recombinants selection. Therefore, this software provides an efficient approach for marker identification from RAD-seq data, and it would be a valuable tool for plant MAS and variety protection.
26955374	The Dynamic Changes of the Plasma Membrane Proteins and the Protective Roles of Nitric Oxide in Rice Subjected to Heavy Metal Cadmium Stress.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The heavy metal cadmium is a common environmental contaminant in soils and has adverse effects on crop growth and development. The signaling processes in plants that initiate cellular responses to environmental stress have been shown to be located in the plasma membrane (PM). A better understanding of the PM proteome in response to environmental stress might provide new insights for improving stress-tolerant crops. Nitric oxide (NO) is reported to be involved in the plant response to cadmium (Cd) stress. To further investigate how NO modulates protein changes in the plasma membrane during Cd stress, a quantitative proteomics approach based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to identify differentially regulated proteins from the rice plasma membrane after Cd or Cd and NO treatment. Sixty-six differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which, many function as transporters, ATPases, kinases, metabolic enzymes, phosphatases, and phospholipases. Among these, the abundance of phospholipase D (PLD) was altered substantially after the treatment of Cd or Cd and NO. Transient expression of the PLD fused with green fluorescent peptide (GFP) in rice protoplasts showed that the Cd and NO treatment promoted the accumulation of PLD in the plasma membrane. Addition of NO also enhanced Cd-induced PLD activity and the accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) produced through PLD activity. Meanwhile, NO elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and caused the accumulation of glutathione, both which function to reduce Cd-induced H2O2 accumulation. Taken together, we suggest that NO signaling is associated with the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione and PA which increases cadmium tolerance in rice via the antioxidant defense system.
26709785	Cry1ab/c in different stages of growth in transgenic rice Bt-shanyou63.	2016	Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	The relationship between the mRNA level and the corresponding protein level of the cry1Ab/c gene is not well characterized in transgenic rice (Bt-ShanYou63). In this study, we compared cry1Ab/c mRNA and its protein expression in leaves at different growth stages in Bt-ShanYou63 rice. The results demonstrated that both cry1Ab/c mRNA and its protein levels changed at all of the growth stages. The cry1Ab/c transcript levels in the leaves were highest during the grain filling stage (3.29, cry/actin) and lowest during the seeding stage (1.06, cry/actin), and the protein levels of Cry1Ab/c was also highest at the grain filling stage (5.71 microgram x g-1 fresh weight, fw) and lowest during the seeding stage (2.08 microgram x g(-1) fw). There was a significant correlation between cry1Ab/c mRNA levels and the protein concentrations (r=0.742, p < 0.01). However, a linear relationship was not observed between cry1Ab/c mRNA levels and the protein levels, and the trend for mRNA expression levels was not consistent with the Cry1Ab/c protein levels in the same growth period in Bt-ShanYou63 rice.
26772971	Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Receptor-like kinases are well-known to play key roles in disease resistance. Among them, the Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) have been shown to be positive regulators of fungal disease resistance in several plant species. WAK genes are often transcriptionally regulated during infection but the pathways involved in this regulation are not known. In rice, the OsWAK gene family is significantly amplified compared to Arabidopsis. The possibility that several WAKs participate in different ways to basal defense has not been addressed. Moreover, the direct requirement of rice OSWAK genes in regulating defense has not been explored.

RESULTS: Here we show using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of four selected OsWAK genes, that individual OsWAKs are required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance. In addition, we show that the very early transcriptional regulation of the rice OsWAK genes is triggered by chitin and is partially under the control of the chitin receptor CEBiP. Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the rice OsWAK genes studied are part of basal defense response, potentially mediated by chitin from fungal cell walls. This work also shows that some OsWAKs, like OsWAK112d, may act as negative regulators of disease resistance.
26781807	The rice DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein is required for the assembly of the restoration of fertility complex.	2016	New Phytol	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and restoration of fertility (Rf) are widely distributed in plant species utilized by humans. RF5 and GRP162 are subunits of the restoration of fertility complex (RFC) in Hong-Lian rice. Despite the fact that the RFC is 400-500 kDa in size, the other proteins or factors in the complex still remain unknown. Here, we identified RFC subunit 3, which encodes a DUF1620-containing and WD40-like repeat protein (RFC3) that is present in all tissues but highly expressed in leaves. We established that RFC3 interacts with both RF5 and GRP162 in vitro and in vivo, and is transported into the mitochondria as a membrane protein. Furthermore, CMS RNA (atp6-orfH79) and CMS cytotoxic protein (ORFH79) accumulate when RFC3 is silenced in restorer lines. We presented the analysis with blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that RFC is disrupted in the RNAi line. We concluded that RCF3 is indispensable as a scaffold protein for the assembly of the RFC complex. We unveil a new molecular player of the RFC in the Rf pathway in rice and propose the model of RFC based on these data.
26809609	Frequent chloroplast RNA editing in early-branching flowering plants: pilot studies on angiosperm-wide coexistence of editing sites and their nuclear specificity factors.	2016	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: RNA editing by cytidine-to-uridine conversions is an essential step of RNA maturation in plant organelles. Some 30-50 sites of C-to-U RNA editing exist in chloroplasts of flowering plant models like Arabidopsis, rice or tobacco. We now predicted significantly more RNA editing in chloroplasts of early-branching angiosperm genera like Amborella, Calycanthus, Ceratophyllum, Chloranthus, Illicium, Liriodendron, Magnolia, Nuphar and Zingiber. Nuclear-encoded RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are key editing factors expected to coevolve with their cognate RNA editing sites in the organelles.

RESULTS: With an extensive chloroplast transcriptome study we identified 138 sites of RNA editing in Amborella trichopoda, approximately the 3- to 4-fold of cp editing in Arabidopsis thaliana or Oryza sativa. Selected cDNA studies in the other early-branching flowering plant taxa furthermore reveal a high diversity of early angiosperm RNA editomes. Many of the now identified editing sites in Amborella have orthologues in ferns, lycophytes or hornworts. We investigated the evolution of CRR28 and RARE1, two known Arabidopsis RNA editing factors responsible for cp editing events ndhBeU467PL, ndhDeU878SL and accDeU794SL, respectively, all of which we now found conserved in Amborella. In a phylogenetically wide sampling of 65 angiosperm genomes we find evidence for only one single loss of CRR28 in chickpea but several independent losses of RARE1, perfectly congruent with the presence of their cognate editing sites in the respective cpDNAs.

CONCLUSION: Chloroplast RNA editing is much more abundant in early-branching than in widely investigated model flowering plants. RNA editing specificity factors can be traced back for more than 120 million years of angiosperm evolution and show highly divergent patterns of evolutionary losses, matching the presence of their target editing events.
27066033	Response of Chloroplast NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase-Mediated Cyclic Electron Flow to a Shortage or Lack in Ferredoxin-Quinone Oxidoreductase-Dependent Pathway in Rice Following Short-Term Heat Stress.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I (PSI) can protect photosynthetic electron carriers under conditions of stromal over-reduction. The goal of the research reported in this paper was to investigate the responses of both PSI and photosystem II (PSII) to a short-term heat stress in two rice lines with different capacities of cyclic electron transfer, i.e., Q4149 with a high capacity (hcef) and C4023 with a low capacity (lcef). The absorbance change at 820 nm (ΔA820) was used here to assess the charge separation in the PSI reaction center (P700). The results obtained show that short-term heat stress abolishes the ferredoxin-quinone oxidoreductase (FQR)-dependent CEF in rice and accelerates the initial rate of P700 (+) re-reduction. The P700 (+) amplitude was slightly increased at a moderate heat-stress (35°C) because of a partial restriction of FQR but it was decreased following high heat-stress (42°C). Assessment of PSI and PSII activities shows that PSI is more susceptible to heat stress than PSII. Under high temperature, FQR-dependent CEF was completely removed and NDH-dependent CEF was up-regulated and strengthened to a higher extent in C4023 than in Q4149. Specifically, under normal growth temperature, hcef (Q4149) was characterized by higher FQR- and chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)-dependent CEF rates than lcef (C4023). Following thermal stress, the activation of NDH-pathway was 130 and 10% for C4023 and Q4149, respectively. Thus, the NDH-dependent CEF may constitute the second layer of plant protection and defense against heat stress after the main route, i.e., FQR-dependent CEF, reaches its capacity. We discuss the possibility that under high heat stress, the NDH pathway serves as a safety valve to dissipate excess energy by cyclic photophosphorylation and overcome the stroma over-reduction following inhibition of CO2 assimilation and any shortage or lack in the FQR pathway. The potential role of the NDH-dependent pathway during the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is briefly discussed.
26826218	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Lamina inclination is a key agronomical character that determines plant architecture and is sensitive to auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs). Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) in rice (Oryza sativa) and its Arabidopsis homologues (SGR5/AtIDD15) have been reported to control plant architecture and auxin homeostasis. This study explores the role of LPA1 in determining lamina inclination in rice. LPA1 acts as a positive regulator to suppress lamina bending. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that LPA1 suppresses the auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs, which regulates lamina inclination independently of OsBRI1. Mutant lpa1 plants are hypersensitive to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the lamina inclination response, which is suppressed by the brassinazole (Brz) inhibitor of C-22 hydroxylase involved in BR synthesis. A strong synergic effect is detected between lpa1 and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination. No significant interaction between LPA1 and OsBRI1 was identified. The lpa1 mutant is sensitive to C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs in the d61-1 (rice BRI1 mutant) background. We present evidence verifying that two independent pathways function via either BRs or BRI1 to determine IAA-mediated lamina inclination in rice. RNA sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR indicate that LPA1 influences the expression of three OsPIN genes (OsPIN1a, OsPIN1c and OsPIN3a), which suggests that auxin flux might be an important factor in LPA1-mediated lamina inclination in rice.
26787525	[Genetic analysis of dense and erect panicle 2 allele DEP2-1388 and its application in hybrid rice breeding].	2016	Yi Chuan	Using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis, we isolated an erect panicle mutant, R1338, from indica heavy-panicle restorer Shuhui498. Compared with wild type control, the mutant displayed dwarfism, erect and short panicle, short primary panicle branch, increased grain density, short grain length and increased grain thickness. In addition, the erect panicle architecture of R1388 resulted in significant decreased bending moment and increased resistance to panicle bending. Histocytological analysis indicated that the diameter of uppermost internode, cellulose content and lignin content play important roles in resistance to panicle bending. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a semi-dominant nuclear gene. With resequencing and MutMap analysis strategy, we found that one SNP from A to G at the seventh exon of DEP2 resulted in the 928(th) amino acid substitution from arginine (AGG) to glycine (GGG) in R1338 mutant. Considering the phenotype of other dep2 mutants, the phenotype of R1338 was likely to be caused by the SNP in DEP2. The mutant R1338 and wild type were crossed with several sterile lines which respectively had different panicle types, the combinations generated from R1338 and curve panicle sterile lines showed semi-erect panicle, higher seed setting percentage and heterosis, and the combinations generated from R1388 and erect panicle sterile line with DEP1 showed erect panicle by gene additive effect. Moreover, the combinations with semi-erect panicle had superior light transmittance and stronger light intensity, which improved efficiency of light utilization to intermediate and subjacent leaves compared to the combinations with curved panicle. This study provides a good strategy to solve the problem of population density in three-line hybrid rice.
27116220	Tracking Se Assimilation and Speciation through the Rice Plant - Nutrient Competition, Toxicity and Distribution.	2016	PLoS One	Up to 1 billion people are affected by low intakes of the essential nutrient selenium (Se) due to low concentrations in crops. Biofortification of this micronutrient in plants is an attractive way of increasing dietary Se levels. We investigated a promising method of Se biofortification of rice seedlings, as rice is the primary staple for 3 billion people, but naturally contains low Se concentrations. We studied hydroponic Se uptake for 0-2500 ppb Se, potential phyto-toxicological effects of Se and the speciation of Se along the shoots and roots as a function of added Se species, concentrations and other nutrients supplied. We found that rice germinating directly in a Se environment increased plant-Se by factor 2-16, but that nutrient supplementation is required to prevent phyto-toxicity. XANES data showed that selenite uptake mainly resulted in the accumulation of organic Se in roots, but that selenate uptake resulted in accumulation of selenate in the higher part of the shoot, which is an essential requirement for Se to be transported to the grain. The amount of organic Se in the plant was positively correlated with applied Se concentration. Our results indicate that biofortification of seedlings with selenate is a successful method to increase Se levels in rice.
26733690	Silicon decreases both uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of manganese in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Silicon (Si) is known to alleviate manganese (Mn) toxicity in a number of plant species; however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the interaction between Si and Mn in rice (Oryza sativa) by using a mutant defective in Si uptake. Silicon alleviated Mn toxicity in the wild-type (WT) rice, but not in the mutant exposed to high Mn. The Mn concentration in the shoots was decreased, but that in the roots was increased by Si in the WT. In contrast, the Mn concentration in the roots and shoots was unaffected by Si in the mutant. Furthermore, Si supply resulted in an increased Mn in the root cell sap, decreased Mn in the xylem sap in the WT, but these effects of Si were not observed in the mutant. A short-term labelling experiment with (54)Mn showed that the uptake of Mn was similar between plants with and without Si and between WT and the mutant. However, Si decreased root-to-shoot translocation of Mn in the WT, but not in the mutant. The expression of a Mn transporter gene for uptake, OsNramp5, was unaffected by a short exposure (<1 d) to Si, but down-regulated by relatively long-term exposure to Si in WT. In contrast, the expression of OsNramp5 was unaffected by Si in the mutant. These results indicated that Si-decreased Mn accumulation results from both Si-decreased root-to-shoot translocation of Mn, probably by the formation of Mn-Si complex in root cells, and uptake by down-regulating Mn transporter gene.
26766411	IREN, a novel EF-hand motif-containing nuclease, functions in the degradation of nuclear DNA during the hypersensitive response cell death in rice.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The hypersensitive response (HR), a type of programmed cell death that is accompanied by DNA degradation and loss of plasma membrane integrity, is a common feature of plant immune responses. We previously reported that transcription of IREN which encodes a novel EF-hand containing plant nuclease is controlled by OsNAC4, a key positive regulator of HR cell death. Transient overexpression of IREN in rice protoplasts also led to rapid DNA fragmentation, while suppression of IREN using RNA interference showed remarkable decrease of DNA fragmentation during HR cell death. Maximum DNA degradation associated with the recombinant IREN was observed in the presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) and Mn(2+). Interestingly, DNA degradation mediated by the recombinant IREN was completely abolished by Zn(2+), even when Ca(2+), Mg(2+), or Mn(2+) were present in the reaction buffer. These data indicate that IREN functions in the degradation of nuclear DNA during HR cell death.
26839515	Secretome analysis of rice suspension-cultured cells infected by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryza (Xoo).	2016	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: Rice bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most devastating bacterial diseases in rice-growing regions worldwide. The rice-Xoo interaction is a classical model for studying the interaction between plants and pathogens. Secreted proteins play important roles in plant-bacterial interactions, but are poorly studied in the rice-Xoo system. Rice cv. Nipponbare is highly susceptible to Xoo. Here, we used two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS), to investigate secreted proteins in Nipponbare embryo cell suspension culture infected by Xoo.

RESULTS: A total of 32 protein spots changed significantly (p < 0.05) by more than 1.5 fold in gel intensity after Xoo inoculation, and were identified by MS. They represent protein products of 11 unique genes, seven from rice and four from Xoo. Of the rice proteins, six up-regulated proteins are involved in cell wall modification, the TCA cycle, glycolysis and redox, while a down-regulated protein, CHIT16, is involved in plant defense. Quantitative Real-Time PCR showed that transcript levels were not correlated with secreted protein levels. Of the Xoo proteins, three of them were possibly located in the extracellular space as shown by transient expression assays in rice protoplasts. Two of the Xoo proteins were previously reported to be likely involved in pathogenicity, and the third gene, Xoo3654, is likely a negative regulator of Xoo virulence as its overexpression reduced Xoo pathogenicity in our study.

CONCLUSION: Among the secreted proteins that responded to Xoo inoculation, we identified rice proteins involved in cell defense and Xoo proteins involved in pathogenicity. Our study also showed that Xoo3654 (X2) protein is likely a novel negative regulator of Xoo virulence. These results not only help us better understand the interaction between susceptible rice and Xoo, but also serve as a reference for studying the interaction between other plants and their pathogens.
26779230	The qTSN Positive Effect on Panicle and Flag Leaf Size of Rice is Associated with an Early Down-Regulation of Tillering.	2015	Front Plant Sci	The qTSN4 was identified as rice QTL (Quantitative Traits Locus) increasing total spikelet number per panicle and flag leaf area but potentially reducing panicle number depending on the environment. So far, this trade-off was mainly observed at grain maturity and not specifically studied in details, limiting the apprehension of the agronomic interest of qTSN4. This study aimed to understand the effect of qTSN4 and of the environment on panicle sizing, its trade-off with panicle number, and finally plant grain production. It compared two high yielding genotypes to their Near Isogenic Lines (NIL) carrying either QTL qTSN4 or qTSN12, two distinct QTLs contributing to the enlarged panicle size, thereafter designated as qTSN. Traits describing C sink (organ appearance rate, size, biomass) and source (leaf area, photosynthesis, sugar availability) were dynamically characterized along plant and/or panicle development within two trials (greenhouse, field), each comparing two treatments contrasting for plant access to light (with or without shading, high or low planting densities). The positive effect of qTSN on panicle size and flag leaf area of the main tiller was confirmed. More precisely, it could be shown that qTSN increased leaf area and internode cross-section, and in some cases of the photosynthetic rate and starch reserves, of the top 3-4 phytomers of the main tiller. This was accompanied by an earlier tillering cessation, that coincided with the initiation of these phytomers, and an enhanced panicle size on the main tiller. Plant leaf area at flowering was not affected by qTSN but fertile tiller number was reduced to an extent that depended on the environment. Accordingly, plant grain production was enhanced by qTSN only under shading in the greenhouse experiment, where panicle number was not affected and photosynthesis and starch storage in internodes was enhanced. The effect of qTSN on rice phenotype was thus expressed before panicle initiation (PI). Whether early tillering reduction or organ oversizing at meristem level is affected first cannot be entirely unraveled. Further studies are needed to better understand any signal involved in this early regulation and the qTSN × Environment interactions underlying its agronomic interest.
26834756	Pigeonpea Hybrid-Proline-Rich Protein (CcHyPRP) Confers Biotic and Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Rice.	2015	Front Plant Sci	In this study, we report the overexpression of Cajanus cajan hybrid-proline-rich protein encoding gene (CcHyPRP) in rice which resulted in increased tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses. Compared to the control plants, the transgenic rice lines, expressing CcHyPRP, exhibited high-level tolerance against major abiotic stresses, viz., drought, salinity, and heat, as evidenced by increased biomass, chlorophyll content, survival rate, root, and shoot growth. Further, transgenic rice lines showed increased panicle size and grain number compared to the control plants under different stress conditions. The CcHyPRP transgenics, as compared to the control, revealed enhanced activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Expression pattern of CcHyPRP::GFP fusion-protein confirmed its predominant localization in cell walls. Moreover, the CcHyPRP transgenics, as compared to the control, exhibited increased resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea which causes blast disease in rice. Higher levels of bZIP and endochitinase transcripts as well as endochitinase activity were observed in transgenic rice compared to the control plants. The overall results demonstrate the intrinsic role of CcHyPRP in conferring multiple stress tolerance at the whole-plant level. The multipotent CcHyPRP seems promising as a prime candidate gene to fortify crop plants for enhanced tolerance/resistance to different stress factors.
26909941	Haplotypes of qGL3 and their roles in grain size regulation with GS3 alleles in rice.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Grain size is an important trait that directly influences rice yield. The qGL3 and GS3 genes are two putative regulators that play a role in grain size determination. A single rare nucleotide substitution (C→A) at position 1092 in exon 10 of qGL3 might be responsible for variations in grain size. However, little is known about the haplotype variations of qGL3 and their interactions with GS3 during the regulation of grain length and grain weight. In this study, qGL3 haplotype variations were examined in 61 Indica varieties, and the effects of qGL3 and GS3 on grain trait variation in 110 lines were evaluated. Six qGL3 haplotypes were identified, and qGL3-2 was a major haplotype in Indica varieties. Moreover, qGL3-6, a reported key single nucleotide polymorphism, was validated. Our results showed that the mutants qgl3 and gs3 (loss-of-function mutation types of qGL3 and GS3, respectively) had significant effects on grain length and grain weight. However, no significant effects associated with differences in the regulation of grain thickness were observed. The genetic effects of qgl3 on grain phenotypes were stronger than those of gs3. In addition to increased grain length, qgl3 had an evident role in grain width increases. In contrast, gs3 played an opposite role in grain width regulation. These results provided novel insights into grain size control and the functions of qgl3 and gs3 in rice yield improvement.
26841062	Soil Nitrogen Status Modifies Rice Root Response to Nematode-Bacteria Interactions in the Rhizosphere.	2016	PLoS One	It has been hypothesized that faunal activity in the rhizosphere influences root growth via an auxin-dependent pathway. In this study, two methods were used to adjust nematode and bacterial populations within experimental soils. One is "exclusion", where soil mixed with pig manure was placed in two bags with different mesh sizes (1mm and 5μm diameter), and then surrounded by an outer layer of unamended soil resulting in soil with a greater populations of bacterial-feeding nematodes (1mm) and a control treatment (5μm). The second method is "inoculation", whereby autoclaved soil was inoculated with bacteria (E. coli and Pseudomonas) and Nematodes (Cephalobus and C. elegans). In order to detect the changes in the rice's perception of auxin under different nutrient and auxin conditions in the presence of soil bacterial-feeding nematodes, responses of soil chemistry (NH4+, NO3- and indole acetic acid (IAA)), rice root growth and the expression of an auxin responsive gene GH3-2 were measured. Results showed that, under low soil nutrient conditions (exclusion), low NO3- correlated with increased root branching and IAA correlated with increased root elongation and GH3-2 expression. However, under high soil nutrient conditions (inoculation), a high NH4+ to NO3- ratio promoted an increase in root surface area and there was an additional influence of NH4+ and NO3- on GH3-2 expression. Thus it was concluded that soil bacterial-feeding nematodes influenced soil nutritional status and soil IAA content, promoting root growth via an auxin dependent pathway that was offset by soil nitrogen status.
26751680	Engineering Yarrowia lipolytica for Campesterol Overproduction.	2016	PLoS One	Campesterol is an important precursor for many sterol drugs, e.g. progesterone and hydrocortisone. In order to produce campesterol in Yarrowia lipolytica, C-22 desaturase encoding gene ERG5 was disrupted and the heterologous 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) encoding gene was constitutively expressed. The codon-optimized DHCR7 from Rallus norvegicus, Oryza saliva and Xenapus laevis were explored and the strain with the gene DHCR7 from X. laevis achieved the highest titer of campesterol due to D409 in substrate binding sites. In presence of glucose as the carbon source, higher biomass conversion yield and product yield were achieved in shake flask compared to that using glycerol and sunflower seed oil. Nevertheless, better cell growth rate was observed in medium with sunflower seed oil as the sole carbon source. Through high cell density fed-batch fermentation under carbon source restriction strategy, a titer of 453±24.7 mg/L campesterol was achieved with sunflower seed oil as the carbon source, which is the highest reported microbial titer known. Our study has greatly enhanced campesterol accumulation in Y. lipolytica, providing new insight into producing complex and desired molecules in microbes.
27124300	Defense Responses in Rice Induced by Silicon Amendment against Infestation by the Leaf Folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis.	2016	PLoS One	Silicon (Si) amendment to plants can confer enhanced resistance to herbivores. In the present study, the physiological and cytological mechanisms underlying the enhanced resistance of plants with Si addition were investigated for one of the most destructive rice pests in Asian countries, the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée). Activities of defense-related enzymes, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase, and concentrations of malondialdehyde and soluble protein in leaves were measured in rice plants with or without leaf folder infestation and with or without Si amendment at 0.32 g Si/kg soil. Silicon amendment significantly reduced leaf folder larval survival. Silicon addition alone did not change activities of defense-related enzymes and malondialdehyde concentration in rice leaves. With leaf folder infestation, activities of the defense-related enzymes increased and malondialdehyde concentration decreased in plants amended with Si. Soluble protein content increased with Si addition when the plants were not infested, but was reduced more in the infested plants with Si amendment than in those without Si addition. Regardless of leaf folder infestation, Si amendment significantly increased leaf Si content through increases in the number and width of silica cells. Our results show that Si addition enhances rice resistance to the leaf folder through priming the feeding stress defense system, reduction in soluble protein content and cell silicification of rice leaves.
26764380	H3K36ac Is an Evolutionary Conserved Plant Histone Modification That Marks Active Genes.	2016	Plant Physiol	In eukaryotic cells, histones are subject to a large number of posttranslational modifications whose sequential or combinatorial action affects chromatin structure and genome function. We identified acetylation at Lys-36 in histone H3 (H3K36ac) as a new chromatin modification in plants. The H3K36ac modification is evolutionary conserved in seed plants, including the gymnosperm Norway spruce (Picea abies) and the angiosperms rice (Oryza sativa), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In Arabidopsis, H3K36ac is highly enriched in euchromatin but not in heterochromatin. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments revealed that H3K36ac peaks at the 5' end of genes, mainly on the two nucleosomes immediately distal to the transcription start site, independently of gene length. H3K36ac overlaps with H3K4me3 and the H2A.Z histone variant. The histone acetyl transferase GCN5 and the histone deacetylase HDA19 are required for H3K36ac homeostasis. H3K36ac and H3K36me3 show negative crosstalk, which is mediated by GCN5 and the histone methyl transferase SDG8. Although H3K36ac is associated with gene activity, we did not find a linear relationship between H3K36ac and transcript levels, suggesting that H3K36ac is a binary indicator of transcription.
26910246	Supplementation of 2-Ap, Zn and La Improves 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline Concentrations in Detached Aromatic Rice Panicles In Vitro.	2016	PLoS One	Aromatic rice is highly prized by consumers worldwide due to its special aromatic character. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is considered to be the single most important volatile compound responsible for aroma in aromatic rice. The present study demonstrated the effects of 2-AP, zinc (Zn) and lanthanum (La) on the 2-AP concentration of detached aromatic rice panicles in vitro. Detached panicles from three well-known aromatic cultivars, Guixiangzhan, Pin14, and Pin 15, were cultured separately in basic culture medium supplemented with 2-AP, Zn and La, and 2-AP concentrations were assessed at 7 and 14 days after culture (DAC). The results show that supplementation of 2-AP, Zn and La in the basic culture medium significantly increases the accumulation of proline. 2-AP concentration and the activity of proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) were also increased in rice grains. Zn concentrations were also found to be higher when Zn was added to the basic culture medium, and La concentrations in grains were too low to be measured. Additionally, grain 2-AP concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with proline concentrations, ProDH activities in grains and 2-AP in culture medium. In summary, higher grain 2-AP concentrations might be due to Zn- and La-induced increases in proline concentrations and ProDH activities, as well as the direct uptake and transportation of 2-AP from the culture medium. Furthermore, application of both Zn and La might be helpful for improving aroma formation in rice. However, interactions of both these elements with the complex process of 2-AP formation remain to be explored.
26755691	Plant Morphology of Heterotrimeric G Protein Mutants.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The heterotrimeric G protein complex, comprising Gα, Gγ and Gγ subunits, is an evolutionarily conserved signaling molecular machine that transmits signals from transmembrane receptors to downstream target proteins. Plants conserved the core G protein elements, while developing their own regulatory systems differently from animals. Genetic evidence supports the conclusion that the heterotrimeric G proteins regulate shoot, root and epidermis development, as well as sugar sensing, hormone responsiveness and abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. This review is a compendium of the known morphological changes conferred by loss- and gain-of-function mutations of the G protein subunit genes across three higher land plant models, namely Arabidopsis, rice and maize.
26806528	Biofortified indica rice attains iron and zinc nutrition dietary targets in the field.	2016	Sci Rep	More than two billion people are micronutrient deficient. Polished grains of popular rice varieties have concentration of approximately 2 μg g(-1) iron (Fe) and 16 μg g(-1) zinc (Zn). The HarvestPlus breeding programs for biofortified rice target 13 μg g(-1) Fe and 28 μg g(-1) Zn to reach approximately 30% of the estimated average requirement (EAR). Reports on engineering Fe content in rice have shown an increase up to 18 μg g(-1) in glasshouse settings; in contrast, under field conditions, 4 μg g(-1) was the highest reported concentration. Here, we report on selected transgenic events, field evaluated in two countries, showing 15 μg g(-1) Fe and 45.7 μg g(-1) Zn in polished grain. Rigorous selection was applied to 1,689 IR64 transgenic events for insert cleanliness and, trait and agronomic performances. Event NASFer-274 containing rice nicotianamine synthase (OsNAS2) and soybean ferritin (SferH-1) genes showed a single locus insertion without a yield penalty or altered grain quality. Endosperm Fe and Zn enrichment was visualized by X-ray fluorescence imaging. The Caco-2 cell assay indicated that Fe is bioavailable. No harmful heavy metals were detected in the grain. The trait remained stable in different genotype backgrounds.
26802561	Insight into mechanism of lanthanum (III) induced damage to plant photosynthesis.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	A great deal of literature is available regarding the environmental and ecological effects of rare earth element pollution on plants. These studies have shown that excess lanthanum (La) (III) in the environment can inhibit plant growth and even cause plant death. Moreover, inhibition of plant photosynthesis is known to be one of the physiological bases of these damages. However, the mechanism responsible for these effects is still unclear. In this study, the mechanism of La(III)-induced damage to plant photosynthesis was clarified from the viewpoint of the chloroplast ultrastructure, the contents of chloroplast mineral elements and chlorophyll, the transcription of chloroplast ATPase subunits and chloroplast Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, in which rice was selected as a study object. Following treatment with low level of La(III), the chloroplast ultrastructure of rice was not changed, and the contents of chloroplast mineral elements (Mg, P, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) increased, but the chlorophyll content did not change significantly. Moreover, the transcription of chloroplast ATPase subunits, chloroplast Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, the net photosynthetic rate and growth indices increased. Following treatment with high levels of La(III), the chloroplast ultrastructure was damaged, chloroplast mineral elements (except Cu and Zn) and chlorophyll contents decreased, and the transcription of chloroplast ATPase subunits, chloroplast Mg(2+)-ATPase activity, the net photosynthetic rate and growth indices decreased. Based on these results, a possible mechanism of La(III)-induced damage to plant photosynthesis was proposed to provide a reference for scientific evaluation of the potential ecological risk of rare earth elements in the environment.
26792976	Genome-Wide Analysis of NBS-LRR Genes in Sorghum Genome Revealed Several Events Contributing to NBS-LRR Gene Evolution in Grass Species.	2016	Evol Bioinform Online	The nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) gene family is crucially important for offering resistance to pathogens. To explore evolutionary conservation and variability of NBS-LRR genes across grass species, we identified 88, 107, 24, and 44 full-length NBS-LRR genes in sorghum, rice, maize, and Brachypodium, respectively. A comprehensive analysis was performed on classification, genome organization, evolution, expression, and regulation of these NBS-LRR genes using sorghum as a representative of grass species. In general, the full-length NBS-LRR genes are highly clustered and duplicated in sorghum genome mainly due to local duplications. NBS-LRR genes have basal expression levels and are highly potentially targeted by miRNA. The number of NBS-LRR genes in the four grass species is positively correlated with the gene clustering rate. The results provided a valuable genomic resource and insights for functional and evolutionary studies of NBS-LRR genes in grass species.
26904091	Heterologous Expression of AtWRKY57 Confers Drought Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Drought stress is a severe environmental factor that greatly restricts plant distribution and crop production. Recently, we have found that overexpressing AtWRKY57 enhanced drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we further reported that the Arabidopsis WRKY57 transcription factor was able to confer drought tolerance to transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The enhanced drought tolerance of transgenic rice was resulted from the lower water loss rates, cell death, malondialdehyde contents and relative electrolyte leakage while a higher proline content and reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme activities was observed during stress conditions. Moreover, further investigation revealed that the expression levels of several stress-responsive genes were up-regulated in drought-tolerant transgenic rice plants, compared with those in wild-type plants. In addition to the drought tolerance, the AtWRKY57 over-expressing plants also had enhanced salt and PEG stress tolerances. Taken together, our study indicates that over-expressing AtWRKY57 in rice improved not only drought tolerance but also salt and PEG tolerance, demonstrating its potential role in crop improvement.
26826216	Cytokinin delays dark-induced senescence in rice by maintaining the chlorophyll cycle and photosynthetic complexes.	2016	J Exp Bot	The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) is known to delay senescence in plants. We studied the effect of a CK analog, 6-benzyl adenine (BA), on rice leaves to understand the possible mechanism by which CK delays senescence in a drought- and heat-tolerant rice cultivar Nagina22 (N22) using dark-induced senescence (DIS) as a surrogate for natural senescence of leaves. Leaves of N22-H-dgl162, a stay-green mutant of N22, and BA-treated N22 showed retention of chlorophyll (Chl) pigments, maintenance of the Chl a/b ratio, and delay in reduction of both photochemical efficiency and rate of oxygen evolution during DIS. HPLC analysis showed accumulation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll (HmChl) during DIS, and the kinetics of its accumulation correlated with progression of senescence. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several plastid-localized genes, specifically those associated with photosystem II (PSII), showed higher transcript levels in BA-treated N22 and the stay-green mutant leaves compared with naturally senescing N22 leaves. Real-time PCR analyses showed that genes coding for enzymes associated with Chl a/b interconversion and proteins associated with light-harvesting complexes maintained higher transcript levels up to 72h of DIS following BA treatment. The pigment-protein complexes analyzed by green gel remained intact in both N22-H-dgl162 and BA-treated N22 leaves even after 96h of DIS. Thus, CK delays senescence by accumulation of HmChl and up-regulating genes in the Chl cycle, thereby maintaining the Chl a/b ratio. Also, CK treatment retains higher transcript levels of PSII-related genes, resulting in the stability of photosynthetic pigment complexes and functional stay-greenness in rice.
27010823	Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci Associated with Toot Traits Using Sequencing-Based Genotyping Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines Derived from 9311 and Nipponbare in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with rice root morphology provides useful information for avoiding drought stress and maintaining yield production under the irrigation condition. In this study, a set of chromosome segment substitution lines derived from 9311 as the recipient and Nipponbare as donor, were used to analysis root morphology. By combining the resequencing-based bin-map with a multiple linear regression analysis, QTL identification was conducted on root number (RN), total root length (TRL), root dry weight (RDW), maximum root length (MRL), root thickness (RTH), total absorption area (TAA) and root vitality (RV), using the CSSL population grown under hydroponic conditions. A total of thirty-eight QTLs were identified: six for TRL, six for RDW, eight for the MRL, four for RTH, seven for RN, two for TAA, and five for RV. Phenotypic effect variance explained by these QTLs ranged from 2.23% to 37.08%, and four single QTLs had more than 10% phenotypic explanations on three root traits. We also detected the correlations between grain yield (GY) and root traits, and found that TRL, RTH and MRL had significantly positive correlations with GY. However, TRL, RDW and MRL had significantly positive correlations with biomass yield (BY). Several QTLs identified in our population were co-localized with some loci for grain yield or biomass. This information may be immediately exploited for improving rice water and fertilizer use efficiency for molecular breeding of root system architectures.
27065353	Overview of OVATE FAMILY PROTEINS, A Novel Class of Plant-Specific Growth Regulators.	2016	Front Plant Sci	OVATE FAMILY PROTEINS (OFPs) are a class of proteins with a conserved OVATE domain. OVATE protein was first identified in tomato as a key regulator of fruit shape. OFPs are plant-specific proteins that are widely distributed in the plant kingdom including mosses and lycophytes. Transcriptional activity analysis of Arabidopsis OFPs (AtOFPs) in protoplasts suggests that they act as transcription repressors. Functional characterization of OFPs from different plant species including Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, pepper, and banana suggests that OFPs regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development, which is likely achieved by interacting with different types of transcription factors including the KNOX and BELL classes, and/or directly regulating the expression of target genes such as Gibberellin 20 oxidase (GA20ox). Here, we examine how OVATE was originally identified, summarize recent progress in elucidation of the roles of OFPs in regulating plant growth and development, and describe possible mechanisms underpinning this regulation. Finally, we review potential new research directions that could shed additional light on the functional biology of OFPs in plants.
27092157	Seed Priming Alters the Production and Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Intermediates in Rice Seedlings Grown under Sub-optimal Temperature and Nutrient Supply.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The production and detoxification of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play an important role in the plant response to nutrient and environmental stresses. The present study demonstrated the behavior of growth, ROIs-production and their detoxification in primed and non-primed rice seedlings under chilling stress (18°C) and nitrogen-(N), phosphorus-(P), or potassium-(K) deprivation. The results revealed that chilling stress as well as deprivation of any mineral nutrient severely hampered the seedling growth of rice, however, seed priming treatments (particularly selenium- or salicylic acid-priming), were effective in enhancing the rice growth under stress conditions. The N-deprivation caused the maximum reduction in shoot growth, while the root growth was only decreased by P- or K-deprivation. Although, N-deprivation enhanced the root length of rice, the root fresh weight was unaffected. Rate of lipid peroxidation as well as the production of ROIs, was generally increased under stress conditions; the K-deprived seedlings recorded significantly lower production of ROIs than N- or P-deprived seedlings. The responses of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in rice seedlings to chilling stress were variable with nutrient management regime. All the seed priming were found to trigger or at least maintain the antioxidant defense system of rice seedlings. Notably, the levels of ROIs were significantly reduced by seed priming treatments, which were concomitant with the activities of ROIs-producing enzymes (monoamine oxidase and xanthine oxidase), under all studied conditions. Based on these findings, we put forward the hypothesis that along with role of ROIs-scavenging enzymes, the greater tolerance of primed rice seedlings can also be due to the reduced activity of ROIs-producing enzymes.
26791837	Comparative mapping of powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 and functional characterization of resistance-related genes in wheat.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 was physically and comparatively mapped by newly developed markers. Seven candidate genes were verified to be required for Pm21 -mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew. Pm21, a gene derived from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, has been transferred into common wheat and widely utilized in wheat resistance breeding for powdery mildew. Previously, Pm21 has been located to the bin FL0.45-0.58 of 6VS by using deletion stocks. However, its fine mapping is still a hard work. In the present study, 30 gene-derived 6VS-specific markers were obtained based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza and Triticeae, and then physically and comparatively mapped in the bin FL0.45-0.58 and its nearby chromosome region. According to the maps, the bin FL0.45-0.58 carrying Pm21 was closely flanked by the markers 6VS-03 and 6VS-23, which further narrowed the orthologous regions to 1.06 Mb in Brachypodium and 1.38 Mb in rice, respectively. Among the conserved genes shared by Brachypodium and rice, four serine/threonine protein kinase genes (DvMPK1, DvMLPK, DvUPK and DvPSYR1), one protein phosphatase gene (DvPP2C) and two transcription factor genes (DvGATA and DvWHY) were confirmed to be required for Pm21-mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) and transcriptional pattern analyses. In summary, this study gives new insights into the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus and the disease resistance pathways mediated by Pm21.
26727453	Analysis of population structure and genetic diversity of Egyptian and exotic rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes.	2016	C R Biol	Understanding the population structure and genetic diversity is a very important goal to improve the economic value of crops. In rice, a loss of genetic diversity in the last few centuries is observed. To address this challenge, a set of 22 lines from three different regions - India (two), and Philippines (six), and Egypt (14) - were used to assess the genetic diversity and the features of population structure. These genotypes were analyzed using 106 SSR alleles that showed a clear polymorphism among the lines. Genetic diversity was estimated based on the number of different alleles, polymorphism information content (PIC), and gene diversity. A total of 106 SSR alleles was identified from the 23 SSR loci and used to study the population structure and carry out a cluster analysis. All SSR loci showed a wide range of the number of different alleles extended from two (one loci) to seven alleles (three loci). Five and eight loci showed high PIC and gene diversity (≥0.70), respectively. The results of population structure are in agreement with cluster analysis results. Both analyses revealed two different subpopulations (G1 and G2) with different genetic properties in number of private alleles, number of different alleles (Na), number of effective alleles (Ne), expected heterozygosity (He), and Shannon's Information Index (SII). Our findings indicate that five SSR loci (RM 111, RM 307, RM 22, RM 19, and RM 271) could be used in breeding programs to enhance the marker-assisted selection through QTL mapping and association studies. A high genetic diversity found between genotypes which can be exploited to improve and produce rice cultivars for important traits (e.g. high agronomic features and tolerance to biotic or/and abiotic stresses).
27066031	Reassessment of the Four Yield-related Genes Gn1a, DEP1, GS3, and IPA1 in Rice Using a CRISPR/Cas9 System.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems have been successfully used as efficient tools for genome editing in a variety of species. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate the Gn1a (Os01g0197700), DEP1 (Os09g0441900), GS3 (Os03g0407400), and IPA1 (Os08g0509600) genes of rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, genes which have been reported to function as regulators of grain number, panicle architecture, grain size and plant architecture, respectively. Analysis of the phenotypes and frequencies of edited genes in the first generation of transformed plants (T0) showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was highly efficient in inducing targeted gene editing, with the desired genes being edited in 42.5% (Gn1a), 67.5% (DEP1), 57.5% (GS3), and 27.5% (IPA1) of the transformed plants. The T2 generation of the gn1a, dep1, and gs3 mutants featured enhanced grain number, dense erect panicles, and larger grain size, respectively. Furthermore, semi-dwarf, and grain with long awn, phenotypes were observed in dep1 and gs3 mutants, respectively. The ipa1 mutants showed two contrasting phenotypes, having either fewer tillers or more tillers, depending on the changes induced in the OsmiR156 target region. In addition, we found that mutants with deletions occurred more frequently than previous reports had indicated and that off-targeting had taken place in highly similar target sequences. These results proved that multiple regulators of important traits can be modified in a single cultivar by CRISPR/Cas9, and thus facilitate the dissection of complex gene regulatory networks in the same genomic background and the stacking of important traits in cultivated varieties.
26786911	A comparative gene analysis with rice identified orthologous group II HKT genes and their association with Na(+) concentration in bread wheat.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Although the HKT transporter genes ascertain some of the key determinants of crop salt tolerance mechanisms, the diversity and functional role of group II HKT genes are not clearly understood in bread wheat. The advanced knowledge on rice HKT and whole genome sequence was, therefore, used in comparative gene analysis to identify orthologous wheat group II HKT genes and their role in trait variation under different saline environments.

RESULTS: The four group II HKTs in rice identified two orthologous gene families from bread wheat, including the known TaHKT2;1 gene family and a new distinctly different gene family designated as TaHKT2;2. A single copy of TaHKT2;2 was found on each homeologous chromosome arm 7AL, 7BL and 7DL and each gene was expressed in leaf blade, sheath and root tissues under non-stressed and at 200 mM salt stressed conditions. The proteins encoded by genes of the TaHKT2;2 family revealed more than 93% amino acid sequence identity but ≤52% amino acid identity compared to the proteins encoded by TaHKT2;1 family. Specifically, variations in known critical domains predicted functional differences between the two protein families. Similar to orthologous rice genes on chromosome 6L, TaHKT2;1 and TaHKT2;2 genes were located approximately 3 kb apart on wheat chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL, forming a static syntenic block in the two species. The chromosomal region on 7AL containing TaHKT2;1 7AL-1 co-located with QTL for shoot Na(+) concentration and yield in some saline environments.

CONCLUSION: The differences in copy number, genes sequences and encoded proteins between TaHKT2;2 homeologous genes and other group II HKT gene families within and across species likely reflect functional diversity for ion selectivity and transport in plants. Evidence indicated that neither TaHKT2;2 nor TaHKT2;1 were associated with primary root Na(+) uptake but TaHKT2;1 may be associated with trait variation for Na(+) exclusion and yield in some but not all saline environments.
27020034	Involvement of a Putative Bipartite Transit Peptide in Targeting Rice Pheophorbide a Oxygenase into Chloroplasts for Chlorophyll Degradation during Leaf Senescence.	2016	J Genet Genomics	Leaf senescence is one of the major factors contributing to the productivity and the grain quality in crops. The regulatory mechanism of leaf senescence remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a rice early senescence 1 (eas1) mutant, which displayed an early leaf senescence phenotype, accompanying by dwarfism and reduced tiller number, eventually leading to the reduction of grain yield. Map-based cloning revealed that the nuclear gene EAS1 encodes a pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), a key enzyme for chlorophyll breakdown. A highly conserved Thr residue of PaO was mutated into Ile in the eas1 mutant. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PaO is an evolutionarily conserved protein, and EAS1 is 68% identical to the Arabidopsis ACCERLERATED CELL DEATH (ACD1) protein. Unlike ACD1 that contains a single transit peptide, EAS1 contains two putative transit peptides at its N-terminus, which are essential for its functionality, suggesting that targeting of EAS1 to the chloroplast is likely mediated by a putative bipartite transit peptide. Consistently, only a short version of EAS1 lacking the first putative transit peptide, but not the full-length EAS1, was capable of rescuing the Arabidopsis acd1 mutant phenotype. These results suggest that rice EAS1 represents a functional PaO, which is involved in chlorophyll degradation and may utilize a unique mechanism for its import into the chloroplast.
26824347	One Step Forward, Two Steps Back; Xeno-MicroRNAs Reported in Breast Milk Are Artifacts.	2016	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA sequences that guide post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via complementarity to their target mRNAs. Discovered only recently, miRNAs have drawn a lot of attention. Multiple protein complexes interact to first cleave a hairpin from nascent RNA, export it into the cytosol, trim its loop, and incorporate it into the RISC complex which is important for binding its target mRNA. This process works within one cell, but circulating miRNAs have been described suggesting a role in cell-cell communication.

MOTIVATION: Viruses and intracellular parasites like Toxoplasma gondii use miRNAs to manipulate host gene expression from within the cellular environment. However, recent research has claimed that a rice miRNA may regulate human gene expression. Despite ongoing debates about these findings and general reluctance to accept them, a recent report claimed that foodborne plant miRNAs pass through the digestive tract, travel through blood to be incorporated by alveolar cells excreting milk. The miRNAs are then said to have some immune-related function in the newborn.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We acquired the data that supports their claim and performed further analyses. In addition to the reported miRNAs, we were able to detect almost complete mRNAs and found that the foreign RNA expression profiles among samples are exceedingly similar. Inspecting the source of the data helped understand how RNAs could contaminate the samples.

CONCLUSION: Viewing these findings in context with the difficulties foreign RNAs face on their route into breast milk and the fact that many identified foodborne miRNAs are not from actual food sources, we can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the original claims and evidence presented may be due to artifacts. We report that the study claiming their existence is more likely to have detected RNA contamination than miRNAs.
26799776	New insights into reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling under low oxygen in plants.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Plants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to low oxygen (O2 ). Much experimental evidence has demonstrated the existence of an oxidative burst when there is an O2 shortage. This originates at various subcellular sites. The activation of NADPH oxidase(s), in complex with other proteins, is responsible for ROS production at the plasma membrane. Another source of low O2 -dependent ROS is the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which misfunctions when low O2 limits its activity. Arabidopsis mutants impaired in proteins playing a role in ROS production display an intolerant phenotype to anoxia and submergence, suggesting a role in acclimation to stress. In rice, the presence of the submergence 1A (SUB1A) gene for submergence tolerance is associated with a higher capacity to scavenge ROS. Additionally, the destabilization of group VII ethylene responsive factors, which are involved in the direct O2 sensing mechanism, requires nitric oxide (NO). All this evidence suggests the existence of a ROS and NO - low O2 mechanism interplay which likely includes sensing, anaerobic metabolism and acclimation to stress. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings on this topic, formulating hypotheses on the basis of the latest advances.
26859143	Uncovering a Nuisance Influence of a Phenological Trait of Plants Using a Nonlinear Structural Equation: Application to Days to Heading and Culm Length in Asian Cultivated Rice (Oryza Sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	Phenological traits of plants, such as flowering time, are linked to growth phase transition. Thus, phenological traits often influence other traits through the modification of the duration of growth period. This influence is a nuisance in plant breeding because it hampers genetic evaluation of the influenced traits. Genetic effects on the influenced traits have two components, one that directly affects the traits and one that indirectly affects the traits via the phenological trait. These cannot be distinguished by phenotypic evaluation and ordinary linear regression models. Consequently, if a phenological trait is modified by introgression or editing of the responsible genes, the phenotypes of the influenced traits can change unexpectedly. To uncover the influence of the phenological trait and evaluate the direct genetic effects on the influenced traits, we developed a nonlinear structural equation (NSE) incorporating a nonlinear influence of the phenological trait. We applied the NSE to real data for cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.): days to heading (DH) as a phenological trait and culm length (CL) as the influenced trait. This showed that CL of the cultivars that showed extremely early heading was shortened by the strong influence of DH. In a simulation study, it was shown that the NSE was able to infer the nonlinear influence and direct genetic effects with reasonable accuracy. However, the NSE failed to infer the linear influence in this study. When no influence was simulated, an ordinary bi-trait linear model (OLM) tended to infer the genetic effects more accurately. In such cases, however, by comparing the NSE and OLM using an information criterion, we could assess whether the nonlinear assumption of the NSE was appropriate for the data analyzed. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the NSE in revealing the phenotypic influence of phenological traits.
26807986	Physiological and genotype-specific factors associated with grain quality changes in rice exposed to high ozone.	2016	Environ Pollut	Rising tropospheric ozone concentrations in Asia affect the yield and quality of rice. This study investigated ozone-induced changes in rice grain quality in contrasting rice genotypes, and explored the associated physiological processes during the reproductive growth phase. The ozone sensitive variety Nipponbare and a breeding line (L81) containing two tolerance QTLs in Nipponbare background were exposed to 100 ppb ozone (8 h per day) or control conditions throughout their growth. Ozone affected grain chalkiness and protein concentration and composition. The percentage of chalky grains was significantly increased in Nipponbare but not in L81. Physiological measurements suggested that grain chalkiness was associated with a drop in foliar carbohydrate and nitrogen levels during grain filling, which was less pronounced in the tolerant L81. Grain total protein concentration was significantly increased in the ozone treatment, although the albumin fraction (water soluble protein) decreased. The increase in protein was more pronounced in L81, due to increases in the glutelin fraction in this genotype. Amino acids responded differently to the ozone treatment. Three essential amino acids (leucine, methionine and threonine) showed significant increases, while seven showed significant treatment by genotype interactions, mostly due to more positive responses in L81. The trend of increased grain protein was in contrast to foliar nitrogen levels, which were negatively affected by ozone. A negative correlation between grain protein and foliar nitrogen in ozone stress indicated that higher grain protein cannot be explained by a concentration effect in all tissues due to lower biomass production. Rather, ozone exposure affected the nitrogen distribution, as indicated by altered foliar activity of the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, such as glutamine synthetase and glutamine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Our results demonstrate differential responses of grain quality to ozone due to the presence of tolerance QTL, and partly explain the underlying physiological processes.
26747287	Deficiency of Starch Synthase IIIa and IVb Alters Starch Granule Morphology from Polyhedral to Spherical in Rice Endosperm.	2016	Plant Physiol	Starch granule morphology differs markedly among plant species. However, the mechanisms controlling starch granule morphology have not been elucidated. Rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm produces characteristic compound-type granules containing dozens of polyhedral starch granules within an amyloplast. Some other cereal species produce simple-type granules, in which only one starch granule is present per amyloplast. A double mutant rice deficient in the starch synthase (SS) genes SSIIIa and SSIVb (ss3a ss4b) produced spherical starch granules, whereas the parental single mutants produced polyhedral starch granules similar to the wild type. The ss3a ss4b amyloplasts contained compound-type starch granules during early developmental stages, and spherical granules were separated from each other during subsequent amyloplast development and seed dehydration. Analysis of glucan chain length distribution identified overlapping roles for SSIIIa and SSIVb in amylopectin chain synthesis, with a degree of polymerization of 42 or greater. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy of wild-type developing rice seeds revealed that the majority of SSIVb was localized between starch granules. Therefore, we propose that SSIIIa and SSIVb have crucial roles in determining starch granule morphology and in maintaining the amyloplast envelope structure. We present a model of spherical starch granule production.
26930200	Transposon Tagging of a Male-Sterility, Female-Sterility Gene, St8, Revealed that the Meiotic MER3 DNA Helicase Activity Is Essential for Fertility in Soybean.	2016	PLoS One	The W4 locus in soybean encodes a dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR2) that regulates pigmentation patterns in flowers and hypocotyl. The mutable w4-m allele that governs variegated flowers has arisen through insertion of a CACTA-type transposable element, Tgm9, in DFR2. In the w4-m line, reversion from variegated to purple flower indicates excision of Tgm9, and its insertion at a new locus. Previously, we have identified a male-sterile, female-sterile mutant among the selfed progenies of a revertant plant carrying only purple flowers. Co-segregation between Tgm9 and the sterility phenotype suggested that the mutant was generated by insertion of Tgm9 at the St8 locus. The transposon was localized to exon 10 of Glyma.16G072300 that shows high identity to the MER3 DNA helicase involved in crossing over. Molecular analysis of fertile branches from two independent revertant plants confirmed precise excision of Tgm9 from the st8 allele, which restored fertility. In soybean, the gene is expressed in flower-buds, trifoliate leaves and stem. Phylogenetic analysis placed St8 in a clade with the Arabidopsis and rice MER3 suggesting that St8 is most likely the orthologous MER3 soybean gene. This study established the utility of Tgm9 in gene identification as well as in forward and reverse genetics studies.
26806409	Down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused semi-male sterility, resulting in reduction of grain yield in rice.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	OsSPX1, a rice SPX domain gene, involved in the phosphate (Pi)-sensing mechanism plays an essential role in the Pi-signalling network through interaction with OsPHR2. In this study, we focused on the potential function of OsSPX1 during rice reproductive phase. Based on investigation of OsSPX1 antisense and sense transgenic rice lines in the paddy fields, we discovered that the down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused reduction of seed-setting rate and filled grain number. Through examination of anthers and pollens of the transgenic and wild-type plants by microscopy, we found that the antisense of OsSPX1 gene led to semi-male sterility, with lacking of mature pollen grains and phenotypes with a disordered surface of anthers and pollens. We further conducted rice whole-genome GeneChip analysis to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism underlying why the down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused deficiencies in anthers and pollens and lower seed-setting rate in rice. The down-regulation of OsSPX1 significantly affected expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transport, anther development, cell cycle, etc. These genes may be related to pollen fertility and male gametophyte development. Our study demonstrated that down-regulation of OsSPX1 disrupted rice normal anther and pollen development by affecting carbohydrate metabolism and sugar transport, leading to semi-male sterility, and ultimately resulted in low seed-setting rate and grain yield.
27092162	Expression of Zinc Transporter Genes in Rice as Influenced by Zinc-Solubilizing Enterobacter cloacae Strain ZSB14.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Zinc (Zn) deficiency in major food crops has been considered as an important factor affecting the crop production and subsequently the human health. Rice (Oryza sativa) is sensitive to Zn deficiency and thereby causes malnutrition to most of the rice-eating Asian populations. Application of zinc solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) could be a sustainable agronomic approach to increase the soil available Zn which can mitigate the yield loss and consequently the nutritional quality of rice. Understanding the molecular interactions between rice and unexplored ZSB is useful for overcoming Zn deficiency problems. In the present study, the role of zinc solubilizing bacterial strain Enterobacter cloacae strain ZSB14 on regulation of Zn-regulated transporters and iron (Fe)-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP) genes in rice under iron sufficient and deficient conditions was assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The expression patterns of OsZIP1, OsZIP4, and OsZIP5 in root and shoot of rice were altered due to the Zn availability as dictated by Zn sources and ZSB inoculation. Fe sufficiency significantly reduced the root and shoot OsZIP1 expression, but not the OsZIP4 and OsZIP5 levels. Zinc oxide in the growth medium up-regulated all the assessed ZIP genes in root and shoot of rice seedlings. When ZSB was inoculated to rice seedlings grown with insoluble zinc oxide in the growth medium, the expression of root and shoot OsZIP1, OsZIP4, and OsZIP5 was reduced. In the absence of zinc oxide, ZSB inoculation up-regulated OsZIP1 and OsZIP5 expressions. Zinc nutrition provided to the rice seedling through ZSB-bound zinc oxide solubilization was comparable to the soluble zinc sulfate application which was evident through the ZIP genes' expression and the Zn accumulation in root and shoot of rice seedlings. These results demonstrate that ZSB could play a crucial role in zinc fertilization and fortification of rice.
26754485	High level of microsynteny and purifying selection affect the evolution of WRKY family in Gramineae.	2016	Dev Genes Evol	The WRKY gene family, which encodes proteins in the regulation processes of diverse developmental stages, is one of the largest families of transcription factors in higher plants. In this study, by searching for interspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) and dating the age distributions of duplicated genes, we found 35 chromosomal segments of subgroup I genes of WRKY family (WRKY I) in four Gramineae species (Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, and maize) formed eight orthologous groups. After a stepwise gene-by-gene reciprocal comparison of all the protein sequences in the WRKY I gene flanking areas, highly conserved regions of microsynteny were found in the four Gramineae species. Most gene pairs showed conserved orientation within syntenic genome regions. Furthermore, tandem duplication events played the leading role in gene expansion. Eventually, environmental selection pressure analysis indicated strong purifying selection for the WRKY I genes in Gramineae, which may have been followed by gene loss and rearrangement. The results presented in this study provide basic information of Gramineae WRKY I genes and form the foundation for future functional studies of these genes. High level of microsynteny in the four grass species provides further evidence that a large-scale genome duplication event predated speciation.
27023243	Acyl-CoA-Binding Proteins (ACBPs) in Plant Development.	2016	Subcell Biochem	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) play a pivotal role in fatty acid metabolism because they can transport medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA esters. In eukaryotic cells, ACBPs are involved in intracellular trafficking of acyl-CoA esters and formation of a cytosolic acyl-CoA pool. In addition to these ubiquitous functions, more specific non-redundant roles of plant ACBP subclasses are implicated by the existence of multigene families with variable molecular masses, ligand specificities, functional domains (e.g. protein-protein interaction domains), subcellular locations and gene expression patterns. In this chapter, recent progress in the characterization of ACBPs from the model dicot plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, and the model monocot, Oryza sativa, and their emerging roles in plant growth and development are discussed. The functional significance of respective members of the plant ACBP families in various developmental and physiological processes such as seed development and germination, stem cuticle formation, pollen development, leaf senescence, peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation and phloem-mediated lipid transport is highlighted.
26858735	Microarray Analysis of Rice d1 (RGA1) Mutant Reveals the Potential Role of G-Protein Alpha Subunit in Regulating Multiple Abiotic Stresses Such as Drought, Salinity, Heat, and Cold.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The genome-wide role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in abiotic stress response in rice has not been examined from a functional genomics perspective, despite the availability of mutants and evidences involving individual genes/processes/stresses. Our rice whole transcriptome microarray analysis (GSE 20925 at NCBI GEO) using the G-alpha subunit (RGA1) null mutant (Daikoku 1 or d1) and its corresponding wild type (Oryza sativa Japonica Nipponbare) identified 2270 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Out of them, we mined for all the potentially abiotic stress-responsive genes using Gene Ontology terms, STIFDB2.0 and Rice DB. The first two approaches produced smaller subsets of the 1886 genes found at Rice DB. The GO approach revealed similar regulation of several families of stress-responsive genes in RGA1 mutant. The Genevestigator analysis of the stress-responsive subset of the RGA1-regulated genes from STIFDB revealed cold and drought-responsive clusters. Meta data analysis at Rice DB revealed large stress-response categories such as cold (878 up/810 down), drought (882 up/837 down), heat (913 up/777 down), and salt stress (889 up/841 down). One thousand four hundred ninety-eight of them are common to all the four abiotic stresses, followed by fewer genes common to smaller groups of stresses. The RGA1-regulated genes that uniquely respond to individual stresses include 111 in heat stress, eight each in cold only and drought only stresses, and two genes in salt stress only. The common DEGs (1498) belong to pathways such as the synthesis of polyamine, glycine-betaine, proline, and trehalose. Some of the common DEGs belong to abiotic stress signaling pathways such as calcium-dependent pathway, ABA independent and dependent pathway, and MAP kinase pathway in the RGA1 mutant. Gene ontology of the common stress responsive DEGs revealed 62 unique molecular functions such as transporters, enzyme regulators, transferases, hydrolases, carbon and protein metabolism, binding to nucleotides, carbohydrates, receptors and lipids, morphogenesis, flower development, and cell homeostasis. We also mined 63 miRNAs that bind to the stress responsive transcripts identified in this study, indicating their post-transcriptional regulation. Overall, these results indicate the potentially extensive role of RGA1 in the regulation of multiple abiotic stresses in rice for further validation.
26566841	The phenome analysis of mutant alleles in Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase genes in rice reveals new potential targets for stress tolerant cereals.	2016	Plant Sci	Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses that reduce their fitness and performance. At the molecular level, the perception of extracellular stimuli and the subsequent activation of defense responses require a complex interplay of signaling cascades, in which protein phosphorylation plays a central role. Several studies have shown that some members of the Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) family are involved in stress and developmental pathways. We report here a systematic analysis of the role of the members of this gene family by mutant phenotyping in the monocotyledon model plant rice, Oryza sativa. We have then targeted 176 of the ∼320 LRR-RLK genes (55.7%) and genotyped 288 mutant lines. Position of the insertion was confirmed in 128 lines corresponding to 100 LRR-RLK genes (31.6% of the entire family). All mutant lines harboring homozygous insertions have been screened for phenotypes under normal conditions and under various abiotic stresses. Mutant plants have been observed at several stages of growth, from seedlings in Petri dishes to flowering and grain filling under greenhouse conditions. Our results show that 37 of the LRR-RLK rice genes are potential targets for improvement especially in the generation of abiotic stress tolerant cereals.
26739616	Genome-wide identification of DNA methylation provides insights into the association of gene expression in rice exposed to pesticide atrazine.	2016	Sci Rep	Atrazine (ATR) is a pesticide widely used for controlling weeds for crop production. Crop contamination with ATR negatively affects crop growth and development. This study presents the first genome-wide single-base-resolution maps of DNA methylation in ATR-exposed rice. Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG methylation marks between the ATR-exposed and ATR-free (control) rice. Most of DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases and DNA demethylase were differentially regulated by ATR. We found more genes hypermethylated than those hypomethylated in the regions of upstream, genebody and downstream under ATR exposure. A stringent group of 674 genes (p < 0.05, two-fold change) with a strong preference of differential expression in ATR-exposed rice was identified. Some of the genes were identified in a subset of loss of function mutants defective in DNA methylation/demethylation. Provision of 5-azacytidine (AZA, inhibitor of DNA methylation) promoted the rice growth and reduced ATR content. By UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, 8 degraded products and 9 conjugates of ATR in AZA-treated rice were characterized. Two of them has been newly identified in this study. Our data show that ATR-induced changes in DNA methylation marks are possibly involved in an epigenetic mechanism associated with activation of specific genes responsible for ATR degradation and detoxification.
27045847	Mitochondrial Genome Analysis of Wild Rice (Oryza minuta) and Its Comparison with Other Related Species.	2016	PLoS One	Oryza minuta (Poaceae family) is a tetraploid wild relative of cultivated rice with a BBCC genome. O. minuta has the potential to resist against various pathogenic diseases such as bacterial blight (BB), white backed planthopper (WBPH) and brown plant hopper (BPH). Here, we sequenced and annotated the complete mitochondrial genome of O. minuta. The mtDNA genome is 515,022 bp, containing 60 protein coding genes, 31 tRNA genes and two rRNA genes. The mitochondrial genome organization and the gene content at the nucleotide level are highly similar (89%) to that of O. rufipogon. Comparison with other related species revealed that most of the genes with known function are conserved among the Poaceae members. Similarly, O. minuta mt genome shared 24 protein-coding genes, 15 tRNA genes and 1 ribosomal RNA gene with other rice species (indica and japonica). The evolutionary relationship and phylogenetic analysis revealed that O. minuta is more closely related to O. rufipogon than to any other related species. Such studies are essential to understand the evolutionary divergence among species and analyze common gene pools to combat risks in the current scenario of a changing environment.
26801786	Analysis of SSH library of rice variety Aganni reveals candidate gall midge resistance genes.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	The Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae, is a serious insect pest causing extensive yield loss. Interaction between the gall midge and rice genotypes is known to be on a gene-for-gene basis. Here, we report molecular basis of HR- (hypersensitive reaction-negative) type of resistance in Aganni (an indica rice variety possessing gall midge resistance gene Gm8) through the construction and analysis of a suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA library. In all, 2,800 positive clones were sequenced and analyzed. The high-quality ESTs were assembled into 448 non-redundant gene sequences. Homology search with the NCBI databases, using BlastX and BlastN, revealed that 73% of the clones showed homology to genes with known function and majority of ESTs belonged to the gene ontology category 'biological process'. Validation of 27 putative candidate gall midge resistance genes through real-time PCR, following gall midge infestation, in contrasting parents and their derived pre-NILs (near isogenic lines) revealed induction of specific genes related to defense and metabolism. Interestingly, four genes, belonging to families of leucine-rich repeat (LRR), heat shock protein (HSP), pathogenesis related protein (PR), and NAC domain-containing protein, implicated in conferring HR+ type of resistance, were found to be up-regulated in Aganni. Two of the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)-scavenging-enzyme-coding genes Cytosolic Ascorbate Peroxidase1, 2 (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2) were found up-regulated in Aganni in incompatible interaction possibly suppressing HR. We suggest that Aganni has a deviant form of inducible, salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance but without HR.
26891550	Cloning and characterization of a water deficit stress responsive transcription factor gene from Oryza sativa L.	2016	Indian J Exp Biol	Understanding the biochemical and molecular basis of drought mechanism in rice is important as drought is one of the major causes affecting rice crop adversely. A 1017 bp gene sequence encoding AP2/ERF family TF was isolated from Oryza sativa sp. Indica cv N22 encoding a protein of 338 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 36.58 kDa, and no intron in the ORF. The gene was named as AP2/ERF-N22(2) different from the drought responsive gene AP2/ERF-N22 that we reported earlier. AP2/ERF-N22(2) has entirely different characteristics from that of AP2/ERF-N22. It has a single AP2 domain of 55 amino acid residues and a cluster of acidic amino acid residues at the C-terminal region, which could function as a trans-activation domain. Presence of NLS indicates that it is a nuclear localized transcription factor encoding gene. It falls in group VI L, sharing characteristic similarities. Arabidopsis members of group VI L have been shown to be involved in response to cytokinin under drought stress.
26566845	From QTL to variety-harnessing the benefits of QTLs for drought, flood and salt tolerance in mega rice varieties of India through a multi-institutional network.	2016	Plant Sci	Rice is a staple cereal of India cultivated in about 43.5Mha area but with relatively low average productivity. Abiotic factors like drought, flood and salinity affect rice production adversely in more than 50% of this area. Breeding rice varieties with inbuilt tolerance to these stresses offers an economically viable and sustainable option to improve rice productivity. Availability of high quality reference genome sequence of rice, knowledge of exact position of genes/QTLs governing tolerance to abiotic stresses and availability of DNA markers linked to these traits has opened up opportunities for breeders to transfer the favorable alleles into widely grown rice varieties through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). A large multi-institutional project, "From QTL to variety: marker-assisted breeding of abiotic stress tolerant rice varieties with major QTLs for drought, submergence and salt tolerance" was initiated in 2010 with funding support from Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, in collaboration with International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. The main focus of this project is to improve rice productivity in the fragile ecosystems of eastern, northeastern and southern part of the country, which bear the brunt of one or the other abiotic stresses frequently. Seven consistent QTLs for grain yield under drought, namely, qDTY1.1, qDTY2.1, qDTY2.2, qDTY3.1, qDTY3.2, qDTY9.1 and qDTY12.1 are being transferred into submergence tolerant versions of three high yielding mega rice varieties, Swarna-Sub1, Samba Mahsuri-Sub1 and IR 64-Sub1. To address the problem of complete submergence due to flash floods in the major river basins, the Sub1 gene is being transferred into ten highly popular locally adapted rice varieties namely, ADT 39, ADT 46, Bahadur, HUR 105, MTU 1075, Pooja, Pratikshya, Rajendra Mahsuri, Ranjit, and Sarjoo 52. Further, to address the problem of soil salinity, Saltol, a major QTL for salt tolerance is being transferred into seven popular locally adapted rice varieties, namely, ADT 45, CR 1009, Gayatri, MTU 1010, PR 114, Pusa 44 and Sarjoo 52. Genotypic background selection is being done after BC2F2 stage using an in-house designed 50K SNP chip on a set of twenty lines for each combination, identified with phenotypic similarity in the field to the recipient parent. Near-isogenic lines with more than 90% similarity to the recipient parent are now in advanced generation field trials. These climate smart varieties are expected to improve rice productivity in the adverse ecologies and contribute to the farmer's livelihood.
26754957	A Novel Naturally Occurring Class I 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase from Janibacter sp. Confers High Glyphosate Tolerance to Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	As glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide extensively used in agriculture worldwide, identification of new aroA genes with high level of glyphosate tolerance is essential for the development and breeding of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant crops. In this study, an aroA gene was cloned from a Janibacter sp. strain isolated from marine sediment (designated as aroAJ. sp). The purified aroAJ. sp enzyme has a Km value of 30 μM for PEP and 83 μM for S3P, and a significantly higher Ki value for glyphosate (373 μM) than aroAE. coli. AroAJ. sp is characterized as a novel and naturally occurring class I aroA enzyme with glyphosate tolerance. Furthermore, we show that aroAJ. sp can be used as an effective selectable marker in both japonica and indica rice cultivar. Transgenic rice lines were tested by herbicide bioassay and it was confirmed that they could tolerate up to 3360 g/ha glyphosate, a dosage four-fold that of the recommended agricultural application level. To our knowledge, it is the first report of a naturally occurring novel class I aroA gene which can be efficiently utilized to study and develop transgenic glyphosate-tolerant crops, and can facilitate a more economical and simplified weed control system.
26799169	Mitochondrial GPX1 silencing triggers differential photosynthesis impairment in response to salinity in rice plants.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	The physiological role of plant mitochondrial glutathione peroxidases is scarcely known. This study attempted to elucidate the role of a rice mitochondrial isoform (GPX1) in photosynthesis under normal growth and salinity conditions. GPX1 knockdown rice lines (GPX1s) were tested in absence and presence of 100 mM NaCl for 6 d. Growth reduction of GPX1s line under non-stressful conditions, compared with non-transformed (NT) plants occurred in parallel to increased H2 O2 and decreased GSH contents. These changes occurred concurrently with photosynthesis impairment, particularly in Calvin cycle's reactions, since photochemical efficiency did not change. Thus, GPX1 silencing and downstream molecular/metabolic changes modulated photosynthesis differentially. In contrast, salinity induced reduction in both phases of photosynthesis, which were more impaired in silenced plants. These changes were associated with root morphology alterations but not shoot growth. Both studied lines displayed increased GPX activity but H2 O2 content did not change in response to salinity. Transformed plants exhibited lower photorespiration, water use efficiency and root growth, indicating that GPX1 could be important to salt tolerance. Growth reduction of GPX1s line might be related to photosynthesis impairment, which in turn could have involved a cross talk mechanism between mitochondria and chloroplast originated from redox changes due to GPX1 deficiency.
26914608	A Comprehensive Assessment of the Effects of Transgenic Cry1Ac/Cry1Ab Rice Huahui 1 on Adult Micraspis discolor (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).	2016	PLoS One	Micraspis discolor (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a widely distributed coleoptera predator in southern Asia in rice ecosystem, and adult M. discolor feed on both rice pollen and soft-bodied arthropods. Bitrophic bioassay and tritrophic bioassay were conducted to evaluate the potential impact of Cry1Ac/Cry1Ab-expressing rice Huahui 1 and its non-transgenic counterpart Minghui 63 on fitness parameters of adult M. discolor. The results showed that the survival, and fecundity of this beetle' adults were not different when they fed on Bt rice or non-Bt rice pollen or Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) reared on Bt rice or non-Bt rice. Toxicity assessment to ensure M. discolor adults were not sensitive to Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac protein independent from the pollen background, M. discolor adults were fed with an artificial diet containing Cry1Ac, Cry1Ab or both protein approximately 10 times higher concentration than in Huahui 1 rice pollen. No difference was detected for any of the life-table parameters tested between Cry protein-containing and pure diet. Artificial diet containing E-64 (N-(trans-Epoxysuccinyl)-L-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide) was included as a positive control. In contrast, the pre-oviposition and fecundity of M. discolor were significantly adversely affected by feeding on E-64-containing diet. In both bioassays, the uptakes of Cry protein by adult M. discolor were tested by ELISA measurements. These results indicated that adults of M. discolor are not affected by Cry1Ab- or Cry1Ac-expressing rice pollen and are not sensitive to Cry protein at concentrations exceeding the levels in rice pollen in Huahui1. This suggests that M. discolor adults would not be harmed by Cry1Ac/Cry1Ab rice if Bt rice Huahui 1 were commercialized.
26765864	Suppression of bacterial infection in rice by treatment with a sulfated peptide.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	The rice XA21 receptor kinase confers robust resistance to bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). A tyrosine-sulfated peptide from Xoo, called RaxX, triggers XA21-mediated immune responses, including the production of ethylene and reactive oxygen species and the induction of defence gene expression. It has not been tested previously whether these responses confer effective resistance to Xoo. Here, we describe a newly established post-inoculation treatment assay that facilitates investigations into the effect of the sulfated RaxX peptide in planta. In this assay, rice plants were inoculated with a virulent strain of Xoo and then treated with the RaxX peptide 2 days after inoculation. We found that post-inoculation treatment of XA21 plants with the sulfated RaxX peptide suppresses the development of Xoo infection in XA21 rice plants. The treated plants display restricted lesion development and reduced bacterial growth. Our findings demonstrate that exogenous application of sulfated RaxX activates XA21-mediated immunity in planta, and provides a potential strategy for the control of bacterial disease in the field.
26851887	Vermicompost humic acids modulate the accumulation and metabolism of ROS in rice plants.	2016	J Plant Physiol	This work aims to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, gene expression, anti-oxidant enzyme activity, and derived effects on membrane lipid peroxidation and certain stress markers (proline and malondialdehyde-MDA) in the roots of unstressed and PEG-stressed rice plants associated with vermicompost humic acid (VCHA) application. The results show that the application of VCHA to the roots of unstressed rice plants caused a slight but significant increase in root ROS accumulation and the gene expression and activity of the major anti-oxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and peroxidase). This action did not have negative effects on root development, and an increase in both root growth and root proliferation occurred. However, the root proline and MDA concentrations and the root permeability results indicate the development of a type of mild stress associated with VCHA application. When VCHA was applied to PEG-stressed plants, a clear alleviation of the inhibition in root development linked to PEG-mediated osmotic stress was observed. This was associated with a reduction in root ROS production and anti-oxidant enzymatic activity caused by osmotic stress. This alleviation of stress caused by VCHA was also reflected as a reduction in the PEG-mediated concentration of MDA in the root as well as root permeability. In summary, the beneficial action of VCHA on the root development of unstressed or PEG-stressed rice plants clearly involves the modulation of ROS accumulation in roots.
27200025	Deciphering Phosphate Deficiency-Mediated Temporal Effects on Different Root Traits in Rice Grown in a Modified Hydroponic System.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Phosphate (Pi), an essential macronutrient for growth and development of plant, is often limiting in soils. Plants have evolved an array of adaptive strategies including modulation of root system architecture (RSA) for optimal acquisition of Pi. In rice, a major staple food, RSA is complex and comprises embryonically developed primary and seminal roots and post-embryonically developed adventitious and lateral roots. Earlier studies have used variant hydroponic systems for documenting the effects of Pi deficiency largely on primary root growth. Here, we report the temporal effects of Pi deficiency in rice genotype MI48 on 15 ontogenetically distinct root traits by using easy-to-assemble and economically viable modified hydroponic system. Effects of Pi deprivation became evident after 4 days- and 7 days-treatments on two and eight different root traits, respectively. The effects of Pi deprivation for 7 days were also evident on different root traits of rice genotype Nagina 22 (N22). There were genotypic differences in the responses of primary root growth along with lateral roots on it and the number and length of seminal and adventitious roots. Notably though, there were attenuating effects of Pi deficiency on the lateral roots on seminal and adventitious roots and total root length in both these genotypes. The study thus revealed both differential and comparable effects of Pi deficiency on different root traits in these genotypes. Pi deficiency also triggered reduction in Pi content and induction of several Pi starvation-responsive (PSR) genes in roots of MI48. Together, the analyses validated the fidelity of this modified hydroponic system for documenting Pi deficiency-mediated effects not only on different traits of RSA but also on physiological and molecular responses.

26830287	Topological characteristics of target genes regulated by abiotic-stress-responsible miRNAs in a rice interactome network.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	A great number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in responding and acting in gene regulatory networks associated with plant tolerance to abiotic stress conditions, such as drought, salinity, and high temperature. The topological exploration of target genes regulated by abiotic-stress-responsible miRNAs (ASRmiRs) in a network facilitates to discover the molecular basis of plant abiotic stress response. This study was based on the staple food rice (Oryza sativa) in which ASRmiRs were manually curated. After having compared the topological properties of target genes (stress-miR-targets) with those (non-stress-miR-targets) not regulated by ASRmiRs in a rice interactome network, we found that stress-miR-targets exhibited distinguishable topological properties. The interaction probability analysis and k-core decomposition showed that stress-miR-targets preferentially interacted with non-stress-miR-targets and located at the peripheral positions in the network. Our results indicated an obvious topological distinction between the two types of genes, reflecting the specific mechanisms of action of stress-miR-targets in rice abiotic stress response. Also, the results may provide valuable clues to elucidate molecular mechanisms of crop response to abiotic stress.
26858569	Improvement of efficient in vitro regeneration potential of mature callus induced from Malaysian upland rice seed (Oryza sativa cv. Panderas).	2016	Saudi J Biol Sci	A new and rapid protocol for optimum callus production and complete plant regeneration has been assessed in Malaysian upland rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Panderas. The effect of plant growth regulator (PGR) on the regeneration frequency of Malaysian upland rice (cv. Panderas) was investigated. Mature seeds were used as a starting material for callus induction experiment using various concentrations of 2,4-D and NAA. Optimal callus induction frequency at 90% was obtained on MS media containing 2,4-D (3 mg L(-1)) and NAA (2 mg L(-1)) after 6 weeks while no significant difference was seen on tryptophan and glutamine parameters. Embryogenic callus was recorded as compact, globular and light yellowish in color. The embryogenic callus morphology was further confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. For regeneration, induced calli were treated with various concentrations of Kin (0.5-1.5 mg L(-1)), BAP, NAA and 0.5 mg L(-1) of TDZ. The result showed that the maximum regeneration frequency (100%) was achieved on MS medium containing BAP (0.5 mg L(-1)), Kin (1.5 mg L(-1)), NAA (0.5 mg L(-1)) and TDZ (0.5 mg L(-1)) within four weeks. Developed shoots were successfully rooted on half strength MS free hormone medium and later transferred into a pot containing soil for acclimatization. This cutting-edge finding is unique over the other existing publishable data due to the good regeneration response by producing a large number of shoots.
26747044	Detection of QTLs for cold tolerance of rice cultivar 'Kuchum' and effect of QTL pyramiding.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A QTL for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice cultivar 'Kuchum' was detected and delimited into a 1.36 Mb region, and a cold-tolerant line was developed by QTL pyramiding. Low temperature in summer causes pollen sterility in rice, resulting in a serious loss of yield. The second most widely grown rice cultivar in Japan, 'Hitomebore', has been developed as a cultivar highly tolerant to low temperature at the booting stage. However, even 'Hitomebore' exhibits sterility at a temperature lower than 18.5 °C. Further improvement of cold tolerance of rice is required. In the present study, QTLs for cold tolerance in a Bhutanese rice variety, 'Kuchum', were analyzed using backcrossed progenies and a major QTL, named qCT-4, was detected on chromosome 4. Evaluating cold tolerance of seven types of near isogenic lines having 'Kuchum' alleles around qCT-4 with a 'Hitomebore' genetic background, qCT-4 was delimited to a region of ca. 1.36 Mb between DNA markers 9_1 and 10_13. Homozygous 'Kuchum' alleles at qCT-4 showed an effect of increasing seed fertility by ca. 10 % under cold-water treatment. Near isogenic lines of 'Hitomebore' having 'Silewah' alleles of Ctb1 and Ctb2 and a 'Hokkai PL9' allele of qCTB8 did not exhibit higher cold tolerance than that of 'Hitomebore'. On the other hand, a qLTB3 allele derived from a Chinese cultivar 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' increased cold tolerance of 'Hitomebore', and pyramiding of the qCT-4 allele and the qLTB3 allele further increased seed fertility under cold-water treatment. Since NILs of 'Hitomebore' with the 'Kuchum' allele of qCT-4 were highly similar to 'Hitomebore' in other agronomic traits, the qCT-4 allele is considered to be useful for developing a cold-tolerant cultivar.
26745604	Evaluation of allergenic potential for rice seed protein components utilizing a rice proteome database and an allergen database in combination with IgE-binding of recombinant proteins.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Among 131 rice endosperm proteins previously identified by MS-based proteomics, most of the proteins showed low or almost no sequence similarity to known allergens in databases, whereas nine proteins did it significantly. The sequence of two proteins showed high overall identity with Hsp70-like hazel tree pollen allergen (Cor a 10) and barley α-amylase (Hor v 16), respectively, whereas the others showed low identity (28-58%) with lemon germin-like protein (Cit l 1), corn zein (Zea m 50 K), wheat chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor (Tri a XI), and kinase-like pollen allergen of Russian thistle (Sal k 1). Immuno-dot blot analysis showed that recombinant proteins for these rice seed homologs were positive in the IgE-binding, but not necessarily similarity dependent, from some allergic patients. These results suggest that utilization of proteome and sequence databases in combination with IgE-binding analysis was effective to screen and evaluate allergenic potential of rice seed protein components.
26782108	Pre-sowing Seed Treatments in Direct-seeded Early Rice: Consequences for Emergence, Seedling Growth and Associated Metabolic Events under Chilling Stress.	2016	Sci Rep	Double direct-seeding for double rice cropping is a simplified, labor saving, and efficient cropping system to improve multiple-crop index and total rice production in central China. However, poor crop establishment of direct-seeded early rice due to chilling stress is the main obstacle to wide spread of this system. A series of experiments were conducted to unravel the effects of pre-sowing seed treatments on emergence, seedling growth and associated metabolic events of direct-seeded early rice under chilling stress. Two seed priming treatments and two seed coating treatments were used in all the experiments. A non-treated control treatment was also maintained for comparison. In both the field and growth chamber studies, seed priming with selenium or salicylic acid significantly enhanced the emergence and seedling growth of rice compared with non-treated control. Nevertheless, such positive effects were not apparent for seed coating treatments. Better emergence and vigorous seedling growth of rice after seed priming was associated with enhanced α-amylase activity, higher soluble sugars contents, and greater respiration rate in primed rice seedlings under chilling stress. Taking together, these findings may provide new avenues for understanding and advancing priming-induced chilling tolerance in direct-seeded early rice in double rice cropping system.
27077373	Mapping QTLs for Salt Tolerance in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Bulked Segregant Analysis of Recombinant Inbred Lines Using 50K SNP Chip.	2016	PLoS One	Soil salinity is a major constraint to rice production in large inland and coastal areas around the world. Modern high yielding rice varieties are particularly sensitive to high salt stress. There are salt tolerant landraces and traditional varieties of rice but with limited information on genomic regions (QTLs) and genes responsible for their tolerance. Here we describe a method for rapid identification of QTLs for reproductive stage salt tolerance in rice using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of bi-parental recombinant inbred lines (RIL). The number of RILs required for the creation of two bulks with extreme phenotypes was optimized to be thirty each. The parents and bulks were genotyped using a 50K SNP chip to identify genomic regions showing homogeneity for contrasting alleles of polymorphic SNPs in the two bulks. The method was applied to 'CSR11/MI48' RILs segregating for reproductive stage salt tolerance. Genotyping of the parents and RIL bulks, made on the basis of salt sensitivity index for grain yield, revealed 6,068 polymorphic SNPs and 21 QTL regions showing homogeneity of contrasting alleles in the two bulks. The method was validated further with 'CSR27/MI48' RILs used earlier for mapping salt tolerance QTLs using low-density SSR markers. BSA with 50K SNP chip revealed 5,021 polymorphic loci and 34 QTL regions. This not only confirmed the location of previously mapped QTLs but also identified several new QTLs, and provided a rapid way to scan the whole genome for mapping QTLs for complex agronomic traits in rice.
26752408	Transcriptome Analysis of Salt Stress Responsiveness in the Seedlings of Dongxiang Wild Rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2016	PLoS One	Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is the progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), and is well known for its superior level of tolerance against cold, drought and diseases. To date, however, little is known about the salt-tolerant character of Dongxiang wild rice. To elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of salt-stress tolerance in Dongxiang wild rice, the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used to analyze the transcriptome profiles of the leaves and roots at the seedling stage under salt stress compared with those under normal conditions. The analysis results for the sequencing data showed that 6,867 transcripts were differentially expressed in the leaves (2,216 up-regulated and 4,651 down-regulated) and 4,988 transcripts in the roots (3,105 up-regulated and 1,883 down-regulated). Among these differentially expressed genes, the detection of many transcription factor genes demonstrated that multiple regulatory pathways were involved in salt stress tolerance. In addition, the differentially expressed genes were compared with the previous RNA-Seq analysis of salt-stress responses in cultivated rice Nipponbare, indicating the possible specific molecular mechanisms of salt-stress responses for Dongxiang wild rice. A large number of the salt-inducible genes identified in this study were co-localized onto fine-mapped salt-tolerance-related quantitative trait loci, providing candidates for gene cloning and elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for salt-stress tolerance in rice.
27194103	Strigolactones are required for nitric oxide to induce root elongation in response to nitrogen and phosphate deficiencies in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	The response of the root system architecture to nutrient deficiencies is critical for sustainable agriculture. Nitric oxide (NO) is considered a key regulator of root growth, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Phenotypic, cellular and genetic analyses were undertaken in rice to explore the role of NO in regulating root growth and strigolactone (SL) signalling under nitrogen-deficient and phosphate-deficient conditions (LN and LP). LN-induced and LP-induced seminal root elongation paralleled NO production in root tips. NO played an important role in a shared pathway of LN-induced and LP-induced root elongation via increased meristem activity. Interestingly, no responses of root elongation were observed in SL d mutants compared with wild-type plants, although similar NO accumulation was induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) application. Application of abamine (the SL inhibitor) reduced seminal root length and pCYCB1;1::GUS expression induced by SNP application in wild type; furthermore, comparison with wild type showed lower SL-signalling genes in nia2 mutants under control and LN treatments and similar under SNP application. Western blot analysis revealed that NO, similar to SL, triggered proteasome-mediated degradation of D53 protein levels. Therefore, we presented a novel signalling pathway in which NO-activated seminal root elongation under LN and LP conditions, with the involvement of SLs.
27200040	Trait Specific Expression Profiling of Salt Stress Responsive Genes in Diverse Rice Genotypes as Determined by Modified Significance Analysis of Microarrays.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Stress responsive gene expression is commonly profiled in a comparative manner involving different stress conditions or genotypes with contrasting reputation of tolerance/resistance. In contrast, this research exploited a wide natural variation in terms of taxonomy, origin and salt sensitivity in eight genotypes of rice to identify the trait specific patterns of gene expression under salt stress. Genome wide transcptomic responses were interrogated by the weighted continuous morpho-physiological trait responses using modified Significance Analysis of Microarrays. More number of genes was found to be differentially expressed under salt stressed compared to that of under unstressed conditions. Higher numbers of genes were observed to be differentially expressed for the traits shoot Na(+)/K(+), shoot Na(+), root K(+), biomass and shoot Cl(-), respectively. The results identified around 60 genes to be involved in Na(+), K(+), and anion homeostasis, transport, and transmembrane activity under stressed conditions. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified 1.36% (578 genes) of the entire transcriptome to be involved in the major molecular functions such as signal transduction (>150 genes), transcription factor (81 genes), and translation factor activity (62 genes) etc., under salt stress. Chromosomal mapping of the genes suggests that majority of the genes are located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. The gene network analysis showed that the transcription factors and translation initiation factors formed the major gene networks and are mostly active in nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria whereas the membrane and vesicle bound proteins formed a secondary network active in plasma membrane and vacuoles. The novel genes and the genes with unknown functions thus identified provide picture of a synergistic salinity response representing the potentially fundamental mechanisms that are active in the wide natural genetic background of rice and will be of greater use once their roles are functionally verified.
26767346	Global Proteome Analyses of Lysine Acetylation and Succinylation Reveal the Widespread Involvement of both Modification in Metabolism in the Embryo of Germinating Rice Seed.	2016	J Proteome Res	Regulation of rice seed germination has been shown to mainly occur at post-transcriptional levels, of which the changes on proteome status is a major one. Lysine acetylation and succinylation are two prevalent protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) involved in multiple biological processes, especially for metabolism regulation. To investigate the potential mechanism controlling metabolism regulation in rice seed germination, we performed the lysine acetylation and succinylation analyses simultaneously. Using high-accuracy nano-LC-MS/MS in combination with the enrichment of lysine acetylated or succinylated peptides from digested embryonic proteins of 24 h after imbibition (HAI) rice seed, a total of 699 acetylated sites from 389 proteins and 665 succinylated sites from 261 proteins were identified. Among these modified lysine sites, 133 sites on 78 proteins were commonly modified by two PTMs. The overlapped PTM sites were more likely to be in polar acidic/basic amino acid regions and exposed on the protein surface. Both of the acetylated and succinylated proteins cover nearly all aspects of cellular functions. Ribosome complex and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-related proteins were significantly enriched in both acetylated and succinylated protein profiles through KEGG enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses. The acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA metabolism-related enzymes were found to be extensively modified by both modifications, implying the functional interaction between the two PTMs. This study provides a rich resource to examine the modulation of the two PTMs on the metabolism pathway and other biological processes in germinating rice seed.
26779218	Comparative Morphophysiological Analyses and Molecular Profiling Reveal Pi-Efficient Strategies of a Traditional Rice Genotype.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Phosphate (Pi) deficiency severely affects crop yield. Modern high yielding rice genotypes are sensitive to Pi deficiency whereas traditional rice genotypes are naturally compatible with low Pi ecosystems. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for low Pi tolerance in traditional genotypes remain largely elusive. To delineate the molecular mechanisms for low Pi tolerance, two contrasting rice genotypes, Dular (low Pi tolerant), and PB1 (low Pi sensitive), have been selected. Comparative morphophysiological, global transcriptome and lipidome analyses of root and shoot tissues of both genotypes grown under Pi deficient and sufficient conditions revealed potential low Pi tolerance mechanisms of the traditional genotype. Most of the genes associated with enhanced internal Pi utilization (phospholipid remobilization) and modulation of root system architecture (RSA) were highly induced in the traditional rice genotype, Dular. Higher reserves of phospholipids and greater accumulation of galactolipids under low Pi in Dular indicated it has more efficient Pi utilization. Furthermore, Dular also maintained greater root growth than PB1 under low Pi, resulting in larger root surface area due to increased lateral root density and root hair length. Genes involved in enhanced low Pi tolerance of the traditional genotype can be exploited to improve the low Pi tolerance of modern high yielding rice cultivars.
26904078	Physiological and Biochemical Mechanisms of Seed Priming-Induced Chilling Tolerance in Rice Cultivars.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice belongs to tropical and subtropical environments and is extremely sensitive to chilling stress particularly during emergence and early stages of seedling development. Seed priming can be a good approach to enhance rice germination and stand establishment under chilling stress. The present study examined the role of different seed priming techniques viz., hydropriming, osmopriming, redox priming, chemical priming, and hormonal priming, in enhancing the chilling tolerance in rice. The most effective reagents and their pre-optimized concentrations based on preliminary experiments were used in this study. Two different rice cultivars were sown under chilling stress (18°C) and normal temperatures (28°C) in separate growth chambers. A non-primed control treatment was also maintained for comparison. Chilling stress caused erratic and delayed germination, poor seedling growth, reduced starch metabolism, and lower respiration rate, while higher lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in rice seedlings of both cultivars. Nevertheless, all the seed priming treatments effectively alleviated the negative effects of chilling stress. In addition, seed priming treatments triggered the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase, and enhanced the accumulations of glutathione and free proline in rice seedlings, which suggests that these measures help prevent the rice seedlings from chilling induced oxidative stress. Chemical priming with selenium and hormonal priming with salicylic acid remained more effective treatments for both rice cultivars under chilling stress than all other priming treatments. The better performance and greater tolerance of primed rice seedlings was associated with enhanced starch metabolism, high respiration rate, lower lipid peroxidation, and strong antioxidative defense system under chilling stress.

27186981	Lack of Genotype and Phenotype Correlation in a Rice T-DNA Tagged Line Is Likely Caused by Introgression in the Seed Source.	2016	PLoS One	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important crops in the world. Several rice insertional mutant libraries are publicly available for systematic analysis of gene functions. However, the tagging efficiency of these mutant resources-the relationship between genotype and phenotype-is very low. We used whole-genome sequencing to analyze a T-DNA-tagged transformant from the Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutants (TRIM) resource. The phenomics records for M0028590, one of the TRIM lines, revealed three phenotypes-wild type, large grains, and tillering dwarf-in the 12 T1 plants. Using the sequencing data for 7 plants from three generations of this specific line, we demonstrate that introgression from an indica rice variety might occur in one generation before the seed was used for callus generation and transformation of this line. In addition, the large-grain trait came from the GS3 gene of the introgressed region and the tillering dwarf phenotype came from a single nucleotide change in the D17 gene that occurred during the callus induction to regeneration of the transformant. As well, another regenerant showed completely heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the whole genome. In addition to the known sequence changes such as T-DNA integration, single nucleotide polymorphism, insertion, deletion, chromosome rearrangement and doubling, spontaneous outcrossing occurred in the rice field may also explain some mutated traits in a tagged mutant population. Thus, the co-segregation of an integration event and the phenotype should be checked when using these mutant populations.
26742102	Rice Seed Priming with Picomolar Rutin Enhances Rhizospheric Bacillus subtilis CIM Colonization and Plant Growth.	2016	PLoS One	The effect of rutin, a bioflavonoid on the growth and biofilm formation of Bacillus subtilis strain CIM was investigated. In addition to swimming, swarming, and twitching potentials of B. subtilis CIM (BS), one picomolar (1 pM) of rutin was also observed to boost the biofilm forming ability of the bacterium. Bio-priming of rice seeds with BS and rutin not only augmented root and shoot lengths but also the photosynthetic pigments like chlorophyll and carotenoid. Similarly, high accumulation of phenolic and flavonoid contents was observed in the leaves. Fluorescent microscopic images revealed that BS plus rutin enhanced callose deposition in the leaves. It was also established that the least formation of reactive oxygen species in BS plus rutin treated rice plants was due to higher free radicals scavenging activity and total antioxidant potential. The results highlight chemo attractant nature of BS towards rutin, which by enhancing biofilm formation and root colonization indirectly strengthened the plants' defensive state.
27148335	Small RNA Profiles of the Rice PTGMS Line Wuxiang S Reveal miRNAs Involved in Fertility Transition.	2016	Front Plant Sci	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in the regulation of plant growth and developmental processes. In this study, RNA-seq was used to examine the expression profiles of miRNAs in a novel, photo-thermosensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) rice line, Wuxiang S (WXS), during fertility transition. A total of 497 known miRNAs and 273 novel miRNAs were identified. In a differential expression analysis, 26 miRNAs exhibited significant differential expression between WXS (Sterile, S) and WXS (Fertile, F). Some of these miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, 11 showed decreased expression levels, and 15 showed increased expression levels in WXS (S) compared to WXS (F). Some of these miRNAs, such as osa-miR156a-j, osa-miR164d, and osa-miR528, were shown to be negatively correlated with their targets. These targets have previously been reported to be related to pollen development and male sterility, suggesting that these miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of pollen development in the rice PTGMS line WXS. Furthermore, miRNA-mediated editing events were also observed. In this study, a possible model for the control of signaling pathways during the process of fertility transition in the rice PTGMS line WXS by miRNAs was developed. These findings contribute to our understanding of the roles of miRNAs during anther development in PTGMS lines in rice.
26791836	Toward integration of genomic selection with crop modelling: the development of an integrated approach to predicting rice heading dates.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: It is suggested that accuracy in predicting plant phenotypes can be improved by integrating genomic prediction with crop modelling in a single hierarchical model. Accurate prediction of phenotypes is important for plant breeding and management. Although genomic prediction/selection aims to predict phenotypes on the basis of whole-genome marker information, it is often difficult to predict phenotypes of complex traits in diverse environments, because plant phenotypes are often influenced by genotype-environment interaction. A possible remedy is to integrate genomic prediction with crop/ecophysiological modelling, which enables us to predict plant phenotypes using environmental and management information. To this end, in the present study, we developed a novel method for integrating genomic prediction with phenological modelling of Asian rice (Oryza sativa, L.), allowing the heading date of untested genotypes in untested environments to be predicted. The method simultaneously infers the phenological model parameters and whole-genome marker effects on the parameters in a Bayesian framework. By cultivating backcross inbred lines of Koshihikari × Kasalath in nine environments, we evaluated the potential of the proposed method in comparison with conventional genomic prediction, phenological modelling, and two-step methods that applied genomic prediction to phenological model parameters inferred from Nelder-Mead or Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. In predicting heading dates of untested lines in untested environments, the proposed and two-step methods tended to provide more accurate predictions than the conventional genomic prediction methods, particularly in environments where phenotypes from environments similar to the target environment were unavailable for training genomic prediction. The proposed method showed greater accuracy in prediction than the two-step methods in all cross-validation schemes tested, suggesting the potential of the integrated approach in the prediction of phenotypes of plants.
26799317	Integrative Analysis of the microRNAome and Transcriptome Illuminates the Response of Susceptible Rice Plants to Rice Stripe Virus.	2016	PLoS One	Rice stripe virus (RSV) is one of the most serious rice viruses in East Asia. To investigate how rice responds to RSV infection, we integrated miRNA expression with parallel mRNA transcription profiling by deep sequencing. A total of 570 miRNAs were identified of which 69 miRNAs (56 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated) were significantly modified by RSV infection. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis showed that 1274 mRNAs (431 up-regulated and 843 down-regulated genes) were differentially expressed as a result of RSV infection. The differential expression of selected miRNAs and mRNAs was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis showed that a complex set of miRNA and mRNA networks were selectively regulated by RSV infection. In particular, 63 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be significantly and negatively correlated with 160 target mRNAs. Interestingly, 22 up-regulated miRNAs were negatively correlated with 24 down-regulated mRNAs encoding disease resistance-related proteins, indicating that the host defense responses were selectively suppressed by RSV infection. The suppression of both osa-miR1423-5p- and osa-miR1870-5p-mediated resistance pathways was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Chloroplast functions were also targeted by RSV, especially the zeaxanthin cycle, which would affect the stability of thylakoid membranes and the biosynthesis of ABA. All these modifications may contribute to viral symptom development and provide new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of RSV.
26793232	Nitric Oxide Alleviated Arsenic Toxicity by Modulation of Antioxidants and Thiol Metabolism in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	Front Plant Sci	Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule and has a profound impact on plant growth and development. It is reported to serve as pro oxidant as well as antioxidant in plant system. In the present study, we evaluated the protective role of NO against arsenate (As(V)) toxicity in rice plants. As(V) exposure has hampered the plant growth, reduced the chlorophyll content, and enhanced the oxidative stress, while the exogenous NO supplementation has reverted these symptoms. NO supplementation has reduced the arsenic (As) accumulation in root as well as shoot. NO supplementation to As(V) exposed plants has reduced the gene expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2. As(V) stress significantly impacted thiol metabolism, it reduced GSH content and GSH/GSSG ratio, and enhanced the level of PCs. NO supplementation maintained the GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced the level of PCs. NO supplementation reverted As(V) induced iron deficiency in shoot and had significant impact of gene expression level of various iron transporters (OsYSL2, OsFRDL1, OsIRT1, and OsIRO2). Conclusively, exogenous application of NO could be advantageous against As(V) toxicity and could confer the tolerance to As(V) stress in rice.
27018583	Linkages and Interactions Analysis of Major Effect Drought Grain Yield QTLs in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Quantitative trait loci conferring high grain yield under drought in rice are important genomic resources for climate resilient breeding. Major and consistent drought grain yield QTLs usually co-locate with flowering and/or plant height QTLs, which could be due to either linkage or pleiotropy. Five mapping populations used for the identification of major and consistent drought grain yield QTLs underwent multiple-trait, multiple-interval mapping test (MT-MIM) to estimate the significance of pleiotropy effects. Results indicated towards possible linkages between the drought grain yield QTLs with co-locating flowering and/or plant height QTLs. Linkages of days to flowering and plant height were eliminated through a marker-assisted breeding approach. Drought grain yield QTLs also showed interaction effects with flowering QTLs. Drought responsiveness of the flowering locus on chromosome 3 (qDTY3.2) has been revealed through allelic analysis. Considering linkage and interaction effects associated with drought QTLs, a comprehensive marker-assisted breeding strategy was followed to develop rice genotypes with improved grain yield under drought stress.
25825876	Genomic prediction of biological shape: elliptic Fourier analysis and kernel partial least squares (PLS) regression applied to grain shape prediction in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2015	PLoS One	Shape is an important morphological characteristic both in animals and plants. In the present study, we examined a method for predicting biological contour shapes based on genome-wide marker polymorphisms. The method is expected to contribute to the acceleration of genetic improvement of biological shape via genomic selection. Grain shape variation observed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasms was delineated using elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs), and was predicted based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. We applied four methods including kernel PLS (KPLS) regression for building a prediction model of grain shape, and compared the accuracy of the methods via cross-validation. We analyzed multiple datasets that differed in marker density and sample size. Datasets with larger sample size and higher marker density showed higher accuracy. Among the four methods, KPLS showed the highest accuracy. Although KPLS and ridge regression (RR) had equivalent accuracy in a single dataset, the result suggested the potential of KPLS for the prediction of high-dimensional EFDs. Ordinary PLS, however, was less accurate than RR in all datasets, suggesting that the use of a non-linear kernel was necessary for accurate prediction using the PLS method. Rice grain shape can be predicted accurately based on genome-wide SNP genotypes. The proposed method is expected to be useful for genomic selection in biological shape.
15807780	Roles of isoamylase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in starch granule synthesis in rice endosperm.	2005	Plant J	Amyloplast-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to monitor amyloplast division and starch granule synthesis in the developing endosperm of transgenic rice. Two classical starch mutants, sugary and shrunken, contain reduced activities of isoamylase1 (ISA1) and cytosolic ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, respectively. Dividing amyloplasts in the wild-type and shrunken endosperms contained starch granules, whereas those in sugary endosperm did not contain detectable granules, suggesting that ISA1 plays a role in granule synthesis at the initiation step. The transition from phytoglycogen to sugary-amylopectin was gradual in the boundary region between the inner and outer endosperms of sugary. These results suggest that the synthesis of sugary-amylopectin and phytoglycogen involved a stochastic process and that ISA1 activity plays a critical role in the stochastic process in starch synthesis in rice endosperm. The reduction of cytosolic ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity in shrunken endosperm did not inhibit granule initiation but severely restrained the subsequent enlargement of granules. The shrunken endosperm often developed pleomorphic amyloplasts containing a large number of underdeveloped granules or a large cluster of small grains of amyloplasts, each containing a simple-type starch granule. Although constriction-type divisions of amyloplasts were much more frequent, budding-type divisions were also found in the shrunken endosperm. We show that monitoring GFP in developing amyloplasts was an effective means of evaluating the roles of enzymes involved in starch granule synthesis in the rice endosperm.
22520048	The family of Deg/HtrA proteases in plants.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The Deg/HtrA family of ATP-independent serine endopeptidases is present in nearly all organisms from bacteria to human and vascular plants. In recent years, multiple deg/htrA protease genes were identified in various plant genomes. During genome annotations most proteases were named according to the order of discovery, hence the same names were sometimes given to different types of Deg/HtrA enzymes in different plant species. This can easily lead to false inference of individual protease functions based solely on a shared name. Therefore, the existing names and classification of these proteolytic enzymes does not meet our current needs and a phylogeny-based standardized nomenclature is required.

RESULTS: Using phylogenetic and domain arrangement analysis, we improved the nomenclature of the Deg/HtrA protease family, standardized protease names based on their well-established nomenclature in Arabidopsis thaliana, and clarified the evolutionary relationship between orthologous enzymes from various photosynthetic organisms across several divergent systematic groups, including dicots, a monocot, a moss and a green alga. Furthermore, we identified a "core set" of eight proteases shared by all organisms examined here that might provide all the proteolytic potential of Deg/HtrA proteases necessary for a hypothetical plant cell.

CONCLUSIONS: In our proposed nomenclature, the evolutionarily closest orthologs have the same protease name, simplifying scientific communication when comparing different plant species and allowing for more reliable inference of protease functions. Further, we proposed that the high number of Deg/HtrA proteases in plants is mainly due to gene duplications unique to the respective organism.
18464598	[The expression, purification and activity analysis of the rice chitinase gene in Escherichia coli].	2008	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	The cloned cDNA sequence of rice (Oryza sativa L. Cpslo17) chitinase gene Oschi was cloned, (which was registered in GenBank, the accession number: EU045451) ligated with the expression vector pGEX-4T-1, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The expression of Oschi was induced by IPTG, and the conditions were optimized. After purification the in vitro activity of Oschi chitinase was analyzed, and the results indicated that it could efficiently degrade chitin.
26272331	Integrated DNA walking system to characterize a broad spectrum of GMOs in food/feed matrices.	2015	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: In order to provide a system fully integrated with qPCR screening, usually used in GMO routine analysis, as well as being able to detect, characterize and identify a broad spectrum of GMOs in food/feed matrices, two bidirectional DNA walking methods targeting p35S or tNOS, the most common transgenic elements found in GM crops, were developed. These newly developed DNA walking methods are completing the previously implemented DNA walking method targeting the t35S pCAMBIA element.

METHODS: Food/feed matrices containing transgenic crops (Bt rice or MON863 maize) were analysed using the integrated DNA walking system.

RESULTS: First, the newly developed DNA walking methods, anchored on the sequences used for the p35S or tNOS qPCR screening, were tested on Bt rice that contains these two transgenic elements. Second, the methods were assessed on a maize sample containing a low amount of the GM MON863 event, representing a more complex matrix in terms of genome size and sensitivity. Finally, to illustrate its applicability in GMO routine analysis by enforcement laboratories, the entire workflow of the integrated strategy, including qPCR screening to detect the potential presence of GMOs and the subsequent DNA walking methods to characterize and identify the detected GMOs, was applied on a GeMMA Scheme Proficiency Test matrix. Via the characterization of the transgene flanking region between the transgenic cassette and the plant genome as well as of a part of the transgenic cassette, the presence of GMOs was properly confirmed or infirmed in all tested samples.

CONCLUSION: Due to their simple procedure and their short time-frame to get results, the developed DNA walking methods proposed here can be easily implemented in GMO routine analysis by the enforcement laboratories. In providing crucial information about the transgene flanking regions and/or the transgenic cassettes, this DNA walking strategy is a key molecular tool to prove the presence of GMOs in any given food/feed matrix.
26504677	A strategy to recover a high-quality, complete plastid sequence from low-coverage whole-genome sequencing.	2015	Appl Plant Sci	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: We developed a bioinformatic strategy to recover and assemble a chloroplast genome using data derived from low-coverage 454 GS FLX/Roche whole-genome sequencing.

METHODS: A comparative genomics approach was applied to obtain the complete chloroplast genome from a weedy biotype of rice from Uruguay. We also applied appropriate filters to discriminate reads representing novel DNA transfer events between the chloroplast and nuclear genomes.

RESULTS: From a set of 295,159 reads (96 Mb data), we assembled the chloroplast genome into two contigs. This weedy rice was classified based on 23 polymorphic regions identified by comparison with reference chloroplast genomes. We detected recent and past events of genetic material transfer between the chloroplast and nuclear genomes and estimated their occurrence frequency.

DISCUSSION: We obtained a high-quality complete chloroplast genome sequence from low-coverage sequencing data. Intergenome DNA transfer appears to be more frequent than previously thought.
26362653	Widespread and Adaptive Alterations in Genome-Wide Gene Expression Associated with Ecological Divergence of Two Oryza Species.	2016	Mol Biol Evol	Ecological speciation is a common mechanism by which new species arise. Despite great efforts, the role of gene expression in ecological divergence and speciation is poorly understood. Here, we conducted a genome-wide gene expression investigation of two Oryza species that are evolutionarily young and distinct in ecology and morphology. Using digital gene expression technology and the paired-end RNA sequencing method, we obtained 21,415 expressed genes across three reproduction-related tissues. Of them, approximately 8% (1,717) differed significantly in expression levels between the two species and these differentially expressed genes are randomly distributed across the genome. Moreover, 62% (1,064) of the differentially expressed genes exhibited a signature of directional selection in at least one species. Importantly, the genes with differential expression between species evolved more rapidly at the 5' flanking sequences than the genes without differential expression relative to coding sequences, suggesting that cis-regulatory changes are likely adaptive and play an important role in the ecological divergence of the two species. Finally, we showed evidence of significant differentiation between species in phenotype traits and observed that genes with differential expression were overrepresented with functional terms involving phenotypic and ecological differentiation between the two species, including reproduction- and stress-related characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that ecological speciation is associated with widespread and adaptive alterations in genome-wide gene expression and provide new insights into the importance of regulatory evolution in ecological speciation in plants.
25740809	Cell dedifferentiation and organogenesis in vitro require more snRNA than does seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2015	J Plant Res	Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is a class of non-coding RNAs that processes pre-mRNA and rRNA. Transcription of abundant snRNA species is regulated by the snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc), which is conserved among multicellular organisms including plants. SRD2, a putative subunit of SNAPc in Arabidopsis thaliana, is essential for development, and the point mutation srd2-1 causes severe defects in hypocotyl dedifferentiation and de novo meristem formation. Based on phenotypic analysis of srd2-1 mutant plants, we previously proposed that snRNA content is a limiting factor in dedifferentiation in plant cells. Here, we performed functional complementation analysis of srd2-1 using transgenic srd2-1 Arabidopsis plants harboring SRD2 homologs from Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), Oryza sativa (rice), the moss Physcomitrella patens, and Homo sapiens (human) under the control of the Arabidopsis SRD2 promoter. Only rice SRD2 suppressed the faulty tissue culture responses of srd2-1, and restore the snRNA levels; however, interestingly, all SRD2 homologs except poplar SRD2 rescued the srd2-1 defects in seedling development. These findings demonstrated that cell dedifferentiation and organogenesis induced during tissue culture require higher snRNA levels than does seedling development.
25479011	Serine-rich protein is a novel positive regulator for silicon accumulation in mangrove.	2015	Gene	Silicon (Si) plays an important role in reducing plant susceptibility against a variety of different biotic and abiotic stresses; and also has an important regulatory role in soil to avoid heavy metal toxicity and providing suitable growing conditions for plants. A full-length cDNAs of 696bp of serine-rich protein was cloned from mangrove plant (Rhizophora apiculata) by amplification of cDNA ends from an expressed sequence tag homologous to groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), submitted to NCBI (KF211374). This serine-rich protein gene encodes a deduced protein of 223 amino acids. The transcript titre of the serine-rich protein was found to be strongly enriched in roots compared with the leaves of two month old mangrove plants and expression level of this serine-rich protein was found to be strongly induced when the mangrove seedlings were exposed to SiO2. Expression of the serine-rich protein transgenic was detected in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, where the amount of serine increased from 1.02 to 37.8mg/g. The same trend was also seen in Si content in the roots (14.3%) and leaves (7.4%) of the transgenic A. thaliana compared to the wild-type plants under Si treatment. The biological results demonstrated that the accumulation of the serine amino acid in the vegetative tissues of the transgenic plants enhanced their ability to absorb and accumulate more Si in the roots and leaves and suggests that the serine-rich protein gene has potential for use in genetic engineering of different stress tolerance characteristics.
26355750	Relationships of wild and domesticated rices (Oryza AA genome species) based upon whole chloroplast genome sequences.	2015	Sci Rep	Rice is the most important crop in the world, acting as the staple food for over half of the world's population. The evolutionary relationships of cultivated rice and its wild relatives have remained contentious and inconclusive. Here we report on the use of whole chloroplast sequences to elucidate the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships in the AA genome Oryza species, representing the primary gene pool of rice. This is the first study that has produced a well resolved and strongly supported phylogeny of the AA genome species. The pan tropical distribution of these rice relatives was found to be explained by long distance dispersal within the last million years. The analysis resulted in a clustering pattern that showed strong geographical differentiation. The species were defined in two primary clades with a South American/African clade with two species, O glumaepatula and O longistaminata, distinguished from all other species. The largest clade was comprised of an Australian clade including newly identified taxa and the African and Asian clades. This refined knowledge of the relationships between cultivated rice and the related wild species provides a strong foundation for more targeted use of wild genetic resources in rice improvement and efforts to ensure their conservation.
25865498	Accelerating plant DNA barcode reference library construction using herbarium specimens: improved experimental techniques.	2015	Mol Ecol Resour	A well-covered reference library is crucial for successful identification of species by DNA barcoding. The biggest difficulty in building such a reference library is the lack of materials of organisms. Herbarium collections are potentially an enormous resource of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that it is likely to build such reference libraries using the reconstructed (self-primed PCR amplified) DNA from the herbarium specimens. We used 179 rosaceous specimens to test the effects of DNA reconstruction, 420 randomly sampled specimens to estimate the usable percentage and another 223 specimens of true cherries (Cerasus, Rosaceae) to test the coverage of usable specimens to the species. The barcode rbcLb (the central four-sevenths of rbcL gene) and matK was each amplified in two halves and sequenced on Roche GS 454 FLX+. DNA from the herbarium specimens was typically shorter than 300 bp. DNA reconstruction enabled amplification fragments of 400-500 bp without bringing or inducing any sequence errors. About one-third of specimens in the national herbarium of China (PE) were proven usable after DNA reconstruction. The specimens in PE cover all Chinese true cherry species and 91.5% of vascular species listed in Flora of China. It is very possible to build well-covered reference libraries for DNA barcoding of vascular species in China. As exemplified in this study, DNA reconstruction and DNA-labelled next-generation sequencing can accelerate the construction of local reference libraries. By putting the local reference libraries together, a global library for DNA barcoding becomes closer to reality.
22783877	Highly conserved low-copy nuclear genes as effective markers for phylogenetic analyses in angiosperms.	2012	New Phytol	Organismal phylogeny provides a crucial evolutionary framework for many studies and the angiosperm phylogeny has been greatly improved recently, largely using organellar and rDNA genes. However, low-copy protein-coding nuclear genes have not been widely used on a large scale in spite of the advantages of their biparental inheritance and vast number of choices. Here, we identified 1083 highly conserved low-copy nuclear genes by genome comparison. Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of five nuclear genes in 91 angiosperms representing 46 orders (73% of orders) and three gymnosperms as outgroups for a highly resolved phylogeny. These nuclear genes are easy to clone and align, and more phylogenetically informative than widely used organellar genes. The angiosperm phylogeny reconstructed using these genes was largely congruent with previous ones mainly inferred from organellar genes. Intriguingly, several new placements were uncovered for some groups, including those among the rosids, the asterids, and between the eudicots and several basal angiosperm groups. These conserved universal nuclear genes have several inherent qualities enabling them to be good markers for reconstructing angiosperm phylogeny, even eukaryotic relationships, further providing new insights into the evolutionary history of angiosperms.
26460928	Multiple origins of BBCC allopolyploid species in the rice genus (Oryza).	2015	Sci Rep	In the rice genus (Oryza), about one half of the species are allopolyploids. These species are not only important resources for rice breeding but also provide a unique opportunity for studying evolution of polyploid species. In the present study, we sequenced four biparentally inherited nuclear loci and three maternally inherited chloroplast fragments from all diploid and tetraploid species with the B- and C-genome types in this genus. We detected at least three independent origins of three BC-genome tetraploid species. Specifically, the diploid O. punctata (B-genome) and O. officinalis (C-genome) were the parental progenitors of O. minuta and O. malampuzhaensis with O. punctata being the maternal donors, whereas the diploid O. punctata and O. eichingeri (C-genome) were the progenitors of tetraploid O. punctata with O. punctata being the paternal donor. Our relaxed clock analyses suggest that all the BBCC species originated within the last one million years, which is coincident with the severe climate oscillations occurred during the last ice age, implying the potential impact of climate change on their formations and dispersals. In addition, our results support previous taxonomic arguments that the tetraploid O. punctata might be better treated as a separate species (O. schweinfurthiana).
24185596	Expression of rice OSH1 gene is localized in developing vascular strands and its ectopic expression in transgenic rice causes altered morphology of leaf.	1995	Plant Cell Rep	Transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) carrying 1 or 2 copies of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter were generated. The transgene caused altered morphology of leaf, such as ligule-replacement and abnormal division of sclerenchyma cells. The phenotype of these leaves resembles that of maize leaf morphological mutant, Knotted 1, which is caused by duplication of the KN1 gene (Veit et al., 1990). The in situ hybridization analysis has revealed that the expression of endogenous OSH1 is mainly localized in developing vascular strands of stem. We have discussed the biological roles of OSH1 in rice based on these results.
26601214	Structural basis for recognition of diverse transcriptional repressors by the TOPLESS family of corepressors.	2015	Sci Adv	TOPLESS (TPL) and TOPLESS-related (TPR) proteins comprise a conserved family of plant transcriptional corepressors that are related to Tup1, Groucho, and TLE (transducin-like enhancer of split) corepressors in yeast, insects, and mammals. In plants, TPL/TPR corepressors regulate development, stress responses, and hormone signaling through interaction with small ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs found in diverse transcriptional repressors. How EAR motifs can interact with TPL/TPR proteins is unknown. We confirm the amino-terminal domain of the TPL family of corepressors, which we term TOPLESS domain (TPD), as the EAR motif-binding domain. To understand the structural basis of this interaction, we determined the crystal structures of the TPD of rice (Os) TPR2 in apo (apo protein) state and in complexes with the EAR motifs from Arabidopsis NINJA (novel interactor of JAZ), IAA1 (auxin-responsive protein 1), and IAA10, key transcriptional repressors involved in jasmonate and auxin signaling. The OsTPR2 TPD adopts a new fold of nine helices, followed by a zinc finger, which are arranged into a disc-like tetramer. The EAR motifs in the three different complexes adopt a similar extended conformation with the hydrophobic residues fitting into the same surface groove of each OsTPR2 monomer. Sequence alignments and structure-based mutagenesis indicate that this mode of corepressor binding is highly conserved in a large set of transcriptional repressors, thus providing a general mechanism for gene repression mediated by the TPL family of corepressors.
27176732	A Genetic Screen Identifies a Requirement for Cysteine-Rich-Receptor-Like Kinases in Rice NH1 (OsNPR1)-Mediated Immunity.	2016	PLoS Genet	Systemic acquired resistance, mediated by the Arabidopsis NPR1 gene and the rice NH1 gene, confers broad-spectrum immunity to diverse pathogens. NPR1 and NH1 interact with TGA transcription factors to activate downstream defense genes. Despite the importance of this defense response, the signaling components downstream of NPR1/NH1 and TGA proteins are poorly defined. Here we report the identification of a rice mutant, snim1, which suppresses NH1-mediated immunity and demonstrate that two genes encoding previously uncharacterized cysteine-rich-receptor-like kinases (CRK6 and CRK10), complement the snim1 mutant phenotype. Silencing of CRK6 and CRK10 genes individually in the parental genetic background recreates the snim1 phenotype. We identified a rice mutant in the Kitaake genetic background with a frameshift mutation in crk10; this mutant also displays a compromised immune response highlighting the important role of crk10. We also show that elevated levels of NH1 expression lead to enhanced CRK10 expression and that the rice TGA2.1 protein binds to the CRK10 promoter. These experiments demonstrate a requirement for CRKs in NH1-mediated immunity and establish a molecular link between NH1 and induction of CRK10 expression.
25747041	Green fluorescent protein fused to the C terminus of RAD51 specifically interferes with secondary DNA binding by the RAD51-ssDNA complex.	2014	Genes Genet Syst	Green fluorescent protein (GFP), fused to the N or C terminus of a protein of interest, is widely used to monitor the localization and mobility of proteins in cells. RAD51 is an essential protein that functions in mitotic DNA repair and meiotic chromosome segregation by promoting the homologous recombination reaction. A previous genetic study with Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that GFP fused to the C terminus of RAD51 (RAD51-GFP) inhibits mitotic DNA repair, but meiotic homologous recombination remained unaffected. To determine how the C-terminal GFP specifically inhibits mitotic DNA repair by RAD51, we purified rice RAD51A1-GFP and RAD51A2-GFP, and performed biochemical analyses. Interestingly, purified RAD51A1-GFP and RAD51A2-GFP are proficient in DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. However, nucleoprotein complexes containing single-stranded DNA and RAD51A1-GFP or RAD51A2-GFP are significantly defective in binding to the second DNA molecule (secondary DNA binding), and consequently fail to catalyze homologous pairing. In contrast, RAD51A1-GFP and RAD51A2-GFP efficiently stimulated homologous pairing promoted by the meiosis-specific RAD51 isoform DMC1. These biochemical characteristics are well conserved in human RAD51-GFP. Therefore, GFP fused to the C terminus of RAD51 abolishes the homologous pairing activity of RAD51 by disrupting secondary DNA binding, but does not affect its DMC1-stimulating activity.
26118128	Comparison of activity of OsDmc1A recombinase of rice (Oryza sativa) in presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.	2015	Indian J Biochem Biophys	Recombinases are known to play an important role in the homology search and strand exchange during meiosis as well as homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair specifically require Mg2+ ion for their activity. The Ca2+ has been shown to stimulate the strand exchange activity of hDmc1 and ScDmc1 by forming the extended filaments on DNA. Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1A (OsDmc1A), a homologue of yeast and human Dmc1 from rice shows the hallmark functions of recombinase. Here, we report the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on OsDmc1A activity from rice (Oryza sativa). OsDmc1A showed a concentration-dependent binding with both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrates in presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+. The ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities, as well as renaturation activity of OsDmc1A were similar in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Increasing the Ca2+ or Mg2+ increased the DNA binding, renaturation and strand exchange of OsDmc1A. But, OsDmc1A showed only a slight stimulation of strand exchange activity in presence of Ca2+, when compared the activity in presence of Mg2+. Electron microscopy showed that OsDmc1A formed ring-like structures in presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+. However, OsDmc1A formed filament like structures with both ss and dsDNA in presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+. Taken together, Ca2+ did not affect OsDmc1A recombinase activity significantly.
26734051	Constitutive Expression of OsIAA9 Affects Starch Granules Accumulation and Root Gravitropic Response in Arabidopsis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) genes are early auxin response genes ecoding short-lived transcriptional repressors, which regulate auxin signaling in plants by interplay with Auxin Response Factors (ARFs). Most of the Aux/IAA proteins contain four different domains, namely Domain I, Domain II, Domain III, and Domain IV. So far all Aux/IAA mutants with auxin-related phenotypes identified in both Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) are dominant gain-of-function mutants with mutations in Domain II of the corresponding Aux/IAA proteins, suggest that Aux/IAA proteins in both Arabidopsis and rice are largely functional redundantly, and they may have conserved functions. We report here the functional characterization of a rice Aux/IAA gene, OsIAA9. RT-PCR results showed that expression of OsIAA9 was induced by exogenously applied auxin, suggesting that OsIAA9 is an auxin response gene. Bioinformatic analysis showed that OsIAA9 has a repressor motif in Domain I, a degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV. By generating transgenic plants expressing GFP-OsIAA9 and examining florescence in the transgenic plants, we found that OsIAA9 is localized in the nucleus. When transfected into protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of Arabidopsis, OsIAA9 repressed reporter gene expression, and the repression was partially released by exogenously IAA. These results suggest that OsIAA9 is a canonical Aux/IAA protein. Protoplast transfection assays showed that OsIAA9 interacted ARF5, but not ARF6, 7, 8 and 19. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsIAA9 have increased number of lateral roots, and reduced gravitropic response. Further analysis showed that OsIAA9 transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated fewer granules in their root tips and the distribution of granules was also affected. Taken together, our study showed that OsIAA9 is a transcriptional repressor, and it regulates gravitropic response when expressed in Arabidopsis by regulating granules accumulation and distribution in root tips.
25482803	Interaction of brassinosteroid functions and sucrose transporter SlSUT2 regulate the formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Transgenic tomato plants with reduced expression of the sucrose transporter SlSUT2 showed higher efficiency of mycorrhization suggesting a sucrose retrieval function of SlSUT2 from the peri-arbuscular space back into the cell cytoplasm plant cytoplasm thereby limiting mycorrhiza fungal development. Sucrose uptake in colonized root cells requires efficient plasma membrane-targeting of SlSUT2 which is often retained intracellularly in vacuolar vesicles. Protein-protein interaction studies suggested a link between SISUT2 function and components of brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling. Indeed, the tomato DWARF mutant d(x) defective in BR synthesis (1) showed significantly reduced mycorrhization parameters. (2) The question has been raised whether the impact of brassinosteroids on mycorrhization is a general phenomenon. Here, we include a rice mutant defective in DIM1/DWARF1 involved in BR biosynthesis to investigate the effects on mycorrhization. A model is presented where brassinolides are able to impact mycorrhization by activating SUT2 internalization and inhibiting its role in sucrose retrieval.
27208292	The De-Etiolated 1 Homolog of Arabidopsis Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	DEETIOLATED1 (DET1) plays a critical role in developmental and environmental responses in many plants. To date, the functions of OsDET1 in rice (Oryza sativa) have been largely unknown. OsDET1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DET1 Here, we found that OsDET1 is essential for maintaining normal rice development. The repression of OsDET1 had detrimental effects on plant development, and leaded to contradictory phenotypes related to abscisic acid (ABA) in OsDET1 interference (RNAi) plants. We found that OsDET1 is involved in modulating ABA signaling in rice. OsDET1 RNAi plants exhibited an ABA hypersensitivity phenotype. Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that OsDET1 interacts physically with DAMAGED-SPECIFIC DNA-BINDING PROTEIN1 (OsDDB1) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC10 (COP10); DET1- and DDB1-ASSOCIATED1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1. We found that the degradation of OsPYL5 was delayed in OsDET1 RNAi plants. These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the COP10-DET1-DDB1 complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice. Additionally, OsDET1 also modulated ABA biosynthesis, as ABA biosynthesis was inhibited in OsDET1 RNAi plants and promoted in OsDET1-overexpressing transgenic plants. In conclusion, our data suggest that OsDET1 plays an important role in maintaining normal development in rice and mediates the cross talk between ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling pathways in rice.
27193392	DgcA, a diguanylate cyclase from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae regulates bacterial pathogenicity on rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the causal agent of rice blight disease as well as a serious phytopathogen worldwide. It is also one of the model organisms for studying bacteria-plant interactions. Current progress in bacterial signal transduction pathways has identified cyclic di-GMP as a major second messenger molecule in controlling Xanthomonas pathogenicity. However, it still remains largely unclear how c-di-GMP regulates the secretion of bacterial virulence factors in Xoo. In this study, we focused on the important roles played by DgcA (XOO3988), one of our previously identified diguanylate cyclases in Xoo, through further investigating the phenotypes of several dgcA-related mutants, namely, the dgcA-knockout mutant ΔdgcA, the dgcA overexpression strain OdgcA, the dgcA complemented strain CdgcA and the wild-type strain. The results showed that dgcA negatively affected virulence, EPS production, bacterial autoaggregation and motility, but positively triggered biofilm formation via modulating the intracellular c-di-GMP levels. RNA-seq data further identified 349 differentially expressed genes controlled by DgcA, providing a foundation for a more solid understanding of the signal transduction pathways in Xoo. Collectively, the present study highlights DgcA as a major regulator of Xoo virulence, and can serve as a potential target for preventing rice blight diseases.
24675172	The rice F-box protein KISS ME DEADLY2 functions as a negative regulator of cytokinin signalling.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Cytokinins are plant hormones that play critical roles in growth and development. We recently determined that the transcriptional response to cytokinin of Arabidopsis is modulated by the KISS ME DEADLY (KMD) family of F-box proteins. Here we demonstrate a conserved function for a member of the rice KMD family. Ectopic overexpression of OsKMD2 in Arabidopsis results in decreased cytokinin sensitivity based on a hypocotyl growth response assay, the decrease in sensitivity correlating with a decrease in the levels of the transcriptional regulator AtARR12. Furthermore, OsKMD2 directly interacts with AtARR12 based on yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. These results indicate that both monocots and dicots employ a similar KMD-dependent mechanism to regulate the transcriptional response to cytokinin.
19505461	Subcellular localization of rice histone deacetylases in organelles.	2009	FEBS Lett	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to function in the nucleus. Here, we report on the organellar localization of three rice HDACs, OsSIR2b, OsHDAC6, and OsHDAC10. The 35S:OsSIR2b-GFP and 35S:OsHDAC10-GFP constructs were introduced into tobacco BY2 cells. Co-localization analysis of the green fluorescent protein and MitoTracker fluorescent signals in the transformed BY2 cells indicated that OsSIR2b and OsHDAC10 are localized in the mitochondria. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines harboring 35S:OsHDAC6-GFP and 35S:OsHDAC10-GFP constructs were similarly analyzed, revealing that OsHDAC6-GFP is localized exclusively in chloroplasts, whereas OsHDAC10-GFP is localized in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. The presence of OsHDAC6-GFP and OsHDAC10-GFP in chloroplasts was verified by immunodetection.
19704731	STOP1, a Cys2/His2 type zinc-finger protein, plays critical role in acid soil tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2008	Plant Signal Behav	Under acid soil condition, rhizotoxic ions such as aluminum and protons cause severe yield loss in food and biomass production via inhibition of root growth and/or enhancement of sensitivity to drought stress. Therefore, improvement of crop tolerance to rhizotoxic ions would be an important target for crop breeding, and identification of key genes that regulate tolerance to both aluminum and proton ions should provide a solution to this limitation. We recently isolated a mutant that shows hyper-sensitivity to protons in root growth, namely stop1 (sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity). The stop1 mutant was isolated from an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population by measuring root growth under low pH (pH 4.3). Interestingly, stop1 also shows hypersensitivity to aluminum ion, but not to other rhizotoxic ions. Cloning of the STOP1 gene revealed that it encodes a Cys2/His2 zinc-finger type transcription factor, and a conserved His residue was replaced with Tyr in the predicted amino acid sequence for the mutant gene. This indicates that STOP1 is involved in the signal transduction pathway of proton and aluminum tolerance. Indeed, under acidic condition, stop1 failed to induce the AtALMT1 gene, which encodes one of the major factors for aluminum tolerance. By searching a public database, we have identified genes homologous to STOP1 in rice, maize and some other plants. Thus, the STOP1 family genes may act as a key factor for acid tolerance in a wide variety of plants.
19704569	Deoxymugineic Acid synthase: a gene important for fe-acquisition and homeostasis.	2006	Plant Signal Behav	Plants can be classified in two groups based on Iron (Fe) acquiring strategy. Graminaceous plants (Strategy II) acquire iron through mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). All MAs are synthesized from L-Met, sharing the same pathway from L-Met to 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) and the subsequent steps may differ depending on plant specie and cultivar. DMA is synthesized through the reduction of a 3''-keto intermediate by deoxymugineic acid synthase (DMAS). Previously, all the genes involved in the synthesis of DMA have been cloned with the exception of DMAS. Recently we have reported the isolation of DMAS genes from rice, wheat, maize and barley. The DMAS belongs to aldo-keto reductase superfamily (AKR). The expression of each of the above DMAS genes is upregulated under Fe-deficient conditions in root tissue, and that of OsDMAS1 and TaDMAS1 are upregulated in shoot tissue. It seems that the expression of DMAS is not regulated at posttranscriptional level. Analysis of OsDMAS1 promoter-GUS transgenic rice suggested that DMA may have role in Fe homeostasis in rice. The cloning of DMAS genes is an important step to develop transgenic rice with increased biosynthesis and section of DMA and ultimately resistant to Fe-deficiency in calcareous soils.
21150304	MAMP-responsive MAPK cascades regulate phytoalexin biosynthesis.	2010	Plant Signal Behav	When plants sense the attack of microbial organisms, they initiate a series of defense responses. One of the most important defense components is the production of phytoalexins that are newly synthesized as anti-microbial secondary metabolites; however, knowledge about the signaling components regulating phytoalexin biosynthesis is limited. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key components in the defense signaling evoked by recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that regulate several defense responses including phytoalexin biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis, biosynthesis of an indole-derived phytoalexin, camalexin, is regulated by MAPK cascades including AtMPK3, AtMPK4 and AtMPK6. Recently, we characterized a novel MAPK cascade in rice (OsMKK4-OsMPK3/OsMPK6) that induces production of diterpenoid phytoalexins by regulating the expression of their biosynthetic genes. Downstream signals of MAPK cascades are thought to be mediated by several transcription factors. To date, AtWRKY33 and OsTGAP1 have been identified as transcriptional activators of phytoalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and rice. Here, we discuss and compare the regulatory mechanisms for phytoalexin biosynthesis through MAPK cascades and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice.
19528530	Expression of unprocessed glutelin precursor alters polymerization without affecting trafficking and accumulation.	2009	J Exp Bot	Rice glutelin is synthesized as a precursor in the endosperm endoplasmic reticulum and then deposited within the protein storage vacuole protein body-II (PB-II) as an aggregate, with a high degree of polymerized higher-order structure comprising mature acidic and basic subunits after post-translation processing cleavage. In order to investigate the functional role of this processing and its effect on folding assembly, wild-type GluA2 and its mutant cDNA (mGluA2), in which the conserved processing site (Asn-Gly) at the junction between the acidic and basic chains was replaced with Ala-Ala, were expressed under the control of the endosperm-specific GluB1 promoter in the mutant rice a123 line lacking glutelin GluA1, GluA2, and GluB4. The mGluA2 precursor was synthesized and stably targeted to PB-II without processing in the transgenic rice seeds like the wild-type GluA2. Notably, the saline-soluble mGluA2 precursor assembled with the other type of processed glutelin GluB as a trimer in PB-II, although such hetero-assembly with GluB was not detected in the transformant containing the processed GluA. Furthermore, the mGluA2 precursor in the glutelin fraction was deposited in PB-II by forming a quite different complex from the processed mature GluA2 products. These results indicate that post-translational processing of glutelin is not necessary for trafficking and stable accumulation in PB-II, but is required for the formation of the higher-order structure required for stacking in PB-II.
16897471	The ACC synthase TOE sequence is required for interaction with ETO1 family proteins and destabilization of target proteins.	2006	Plant Mol Biol	The Arabidopsis ETO1 protein is a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis. It specifically inhibits the enzyme activity of type 2 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases (ACC synthases or ACS) and promotes their degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway. To further understand the function of the ETO1 family in the plant kingdom, we cloned a cDNA of LeEOL1 (Lycopersicon esculentum ETO 1- LIKE 1), an ETO1 homolog from tomato. LeEOL1 encodes a putative protein with domain architecture conserved in the Arabidopsis ETO1/EOL1/EOL2 proteins and in the predicted rice EOL proteins. LeEOL1 is expressed in leaf, stem, root, flower, and the full ripe stage of fruit, suggesting diverse regulatory roles in the development of tomato. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed specific interactions between LeEOL1 and type 2 ACC synthases. When the C-terminal 14 amino acids (TOE; target of ETO1) of LE-ACS3 specific to type 2 ACC synthases were fused to a type 1 ACS, LE-ACS2, at the corresponding position, it allowed LE-ACS2 to strongly interact with LeEOL1. A GFP-TOE(LE-ACS3) fusion protein expressed in rice calli and in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis showed reduced stability compared to native GFP. However, the fluorescence of GFP-TOE(LE-ACS3) was comparable to that of the native GFP in Arabidopsis eto1-4 mutant. Furthermore, MG132 treatment significantly enhanced the fluorescence of GFP-TOE(LE-ACS3) in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis. These results suggest that the ETO1-family-mediated ACS protein degradation pathway is conserved in both monocots and dicots, and that TOE acts as a protein destabilization signal recognized by the ETO1 protein family.
21051956	The carbohydrate-binding module (CBM)-like sequence is crucial for rice CWA1/BC1 function in proper assembly of secondary cell wall materials.	2010	Plant Signal Behav	We recently reported that the cwa1 mutation disturbed the deposition and assembly of secondary cell wall materials in the cortical fiber of rice internodes. Genetic analysis revealed that cwa1 is allelic to bc1, which encodes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored COBRA-like protein with the highest homology to Arabidopsis COBRA-like 4 (COBL4) and maize Brittle Stalk 2 (Bk2). Our results suggested that CWA1/BC1 plays a role in assembling secondary cell wall materials at appropriate sites, enabling synthesis of highly ordered secondary cell wall structure with solid and flexible internodes in rice. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CWA1/BC1, as well as its orthologs (COBL4, Bk2) and other BC1-like proteins in rice, shows weak similarity to a family II carbohydrate-binding module (CBM2) of several bacterial cellulases. To investigate the importance of the CBM-like sequence of CWA1/BC1 in the assembly of secondary cell wall materials, Trp residues in the CBM-like sequence, which is important for carbohydrate binding, were substituted for Val residues and introduced into the cwa1 mutant. CWA1/BC1 with the mutated sequence did not complement the abnormal secondary cell walls seen in the cwa1 mutant, indicating that the CBM-like sequence is essential for the proper function of CWA1/BC1, including assembly of secondary cell wall materials.
18316317	Overproduction of C4 photosynthetic enzymes in transgenic rice plants: an approach to introduce the C4-like photosynthetic pathway into rice.	2008	J Exp Bot	Four enzymes, namely, the maize C(4)-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), the maize C(4)-specific pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), the sorghum NADP-malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and the rice C(3)-specific NADP-malic enzyme (ME), were overproduced in the mesophyll cells of rice plants independently or in combination. Overproduction individually of PPDK, MDH or ME did not affect the rate of photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation, while in the case of PEPC it was slightly reduced. The reduction in CO(2) assimilation in PEPC overproduction lines remained unaffected by overproduction of PPDK, ME or a combination of both, however it was significantly restored by the combined overproduction of PPDK, ME, and MDH to reach levels comparable to or slightly higher than that of non-transgenic rice. The extent of the restoration of CO(2) assimilation, however, was more marked at higher CO(2) concentrations, an indication that overproduction of the four enzymes in combination did not act to concentrate CO(2) inside the chloroplast. Transgenic rice plants overproducing the four enzymes showed slight stunting. Comparison of transformants overproducing different combinations of enzymes indicated that overproduction of PEPC together with ME was responsible for stunting, and that overproduction of MDH had some mitigating effects. Possible mechanisms underlying these phenotypic effects, as well as possibilities and limitations of introducing the C(4)-like photosynthetic pathway into C(3) plants, are discussed.
16233652	Isolation and characterization of sake yeast mutants deficient in gamma-aminobutyric acid utilization in sake brewing.	2004	J Biosci Bioeng	Sake yeasts take up gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derived from rice-koji in the primary stage of sake brewing. The GABA content in sake brewed with the UGA1 disruptant, which lacked GABA transaminase, was higher than that brewed with the wild-type strain K701. The UGA1 disruptant derived from sake yeast could not grow on a medium with GABA as the sole nitrogen source. We have isolated the sake yeast mutants of K701 that were unable to grow on a medium containing GABA as the sole nitrogen source. The growth defect of GAB7-1 and GAB7-2 mutants on GABA plates was complemented by UGA1, which encodes GABA transaminase, and UGA2, which encodes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), respectively. DNA sequence analysis revealed that GAB7-1 had a homozygous nonsense mutation in UGA1 and GAB7-2 had a heterozygous mutation (G247D) in UGA2. The GABA transaminase activity of GAB7-1 and the SSADH activity of GAB7-2 were markedly lower than those of K701. These GAB mutants displayed a higher intracellular GABA content. The GABA contents in sake brewed with the mutants GAB7-1 and GAB7-2 were 2.0 and 2.1 times higher, respectively, than that brewed with the wild-type strain K701. These results suggest that the reduced function of the GABA utilization pathway increases the GABA content in sake.
17147638	Efficient production of male and female sterile plants by expression of a chimeric repressor in Arabidopsis and rice.	2006	Plant Biotechnol J	Male and female sterile plants are particularly useful for the effective production of commercial hybrid plants and for preventing the diffusion of seeds or pollen grains of genetically modified plants in the open field. In an attempt to create several types of sterile plant by genetic manipulation, we applied our Chimeric REpressor Gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) to four transcription factors, namely APETALA3, AGAMOUS, LEAFY and AtMYB26, involved in the regulation of petal and stamen identity, stamen and carpel identity, floral meristem identity and anther dehiscence, respectively, in Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants expressing each chimeric repressor exhibited, at high frequency, a sterile phenotype that resembled the loss-of-function phenotype of each corresponding gene. Furthermore, in the monocotyledonous crop plant 'rice', expression of the chimeric repressor derived from SUPERWOMAN1, the rice orthologue of APETALA3, resulted in the male sterile phenotype with high efficiency. Our results indicate that CRES-T provides a powerful tool for controlling the fertility of both monocots and dicots by exploiting transcription factors that are strongly conserved amongst plants.
8665098	Specific expression of the chloroplast gene for RNA polymerase (rpoB) at an early stage of leaf development in rice.	1996	Plant Cell Physiol	The rpoB gene for the beta subunit of rice chloroplast RNA polymerase was found to be highly expressed in unexpanded immature leaves that contained proplastids, indicating the specific expression of rpoB at an early stage of chloroplast development. A putative transcription start site (tss) was identified, but the 5' upstream region of the tss had no sequences resembling typical --35 and --10 elements. A palindromic sequence and high AT-content were recognized.
27182946	Hybrid Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Involves the Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain Containing Protein.	2016	Genetics	Intersubspecific hybrid sterility is a common form of reproductive isolation in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which significantly hampers the utilization of heterosis between indica and japonica varieties. Here, we elucidated the mechanism of S7, which specially causes Aus-japonica/indica hybrid female sterility, through cytological and genetic analysis, map-based cloning, and transformation experiments. Abnormal positioning of polar nuclei and smaller embryo sac were observed in F1 compared with male and female parents. Female gametes carrying S7(cp) and S7(i) were aborted in S7(ai)/S7(cp) and S7(ai)/S7(i), respectively, whereas they were normal in both N22 and Dular possessing a neutral allele, S7(n) S7 was fine mapped to a 139-kb region in the centromere region on chromosome 7, where the recombination was remarkably suppressed due to aggregation of retrotransposons. Among 16 putative open reading frames (ORFs) localized in the mapping region, ORF3 encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat domain containing protein was highly expressed in the pistil. Transformation experiments demonstrated that ORF3 is the candidate gene: downregulated expression of ORF3 restored spikelet fertility and eliminated absolutely preferential transmission of S7(ai) in heterozygote S7(ai)/S7(cp); sterility occurred in the transformants Cpslo17-S7(ai) Our results may provide implications for overcoming hybrid embryo sac sterility in intersubspecific hybrid rice and utilization of hybrid heterosis for cultivated rice improvement.
27322545	Genome-wide association study using whole-genome sequencing rapidly identifies new genes influencing agronomic traits in rice.	2016	Nat Genet	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) can be a powerful tool for the identification of genes associated with agronomic traits in crop species, but it is often hindered by population structure and the large extent of linkage disequilibrium. In this study, we identified agronomically important genes in rice using GWAS based on whole-genome sequencing, followed by the screening of candidate genes based on the estimated effect of nucleotide polymorphisms. Using this approach, we identified four new genes associated with agronomic traits. Some genes were undetectable by standard SNP analysis, but we detected them using gene-based association analysis. This study provides fundamental insights relevant to the rapid identification of genes associated with agronomic traits using GWAS and will accelerate future efforts aimed at crop improvement.
27354554	Evolutionarily Distinct BAHD N-Acyltransferases Are Responsible for Natural Variation of Aromatic Amine Conjugates in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	Phenolamides (PAs) are specialized (secondary) metabolites mainly synthesized by BAHD N-acyltransferases. Here, we report metabolic profiling coupled with association and linkage mapping of 11 PAs in rice (Oryza sativa). We identified 22 loci affecting PAs in leaves and 16 loci affecting PAs in seeds. We identified eight BAHD N-acyltransferases located on five chromosomes with diverse specificities, including four aromatic amine N-acyltransferases. We show that genetic variation in PAs is determined, at least in part, by allelic variation in the tissue specificity of expression of the BAHD genes responsible for their biosynthesis. Tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-THT1/2) and tryptamine benzoyl transferase 1/2 (Os-TBT1/2) were found to be bifunctional tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases. The specificity of Os-THT1 and Os-TBT1 for agmatine involved four tandem arginine residues, which have not been identified as specificity determinants for other plant BAHD transferases, illustrating the versatility of plant BAHD transferases in acquiring new acyl acceptor specificities. With phylogenetic analysis, we identified both divergent and convergent evolution of N-acyltransferases in plants, and we suggest that the BAHD family of tryptamine/tyramine N-acyltransferases evolved conservatively in monocots, especially in Gramineae. Our work demonstrates that omics-assisted gene-to-metabolite analysis provides a useful tool for bulk gene identification and crop genetic improvement.
27243642	Mutation of Aryl Binding Pocket Residues Results in an Unexpected Activity Switch in an Oryza sativa Tyrosine Aminomutase.	2016	Biochemistry	
27274069	Overexpression of a pH-sensitive nitrate transporter in rice increases crop yields.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cellular pH homeostasis is fundamental for life, and all cells adapt to maintain this balance. In plants, the chemical form of nitrogen supply, nitrate and ammonium, is one of the cellular pH dominators. We report that the rice nitrate transporter OsNRT2.3 is transcribed into two spliced isoforms with a natural variation in expression ratio. One splice form, OsNRT2.3b is located on the plasma membrane, is expressed mainly in the phloem, and has a regulatory motif on the cytosolic side that acts to switch nitrate transport activity on or off by a pH-sensing mechanism. High OsNRT2.3b expression in rice enhances the pH-buffering capacity of the plant, increasing N, Fe, and P uptake. In field trials, increased expression of OsNRT2.3b improved grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by 40%. These results indicate that pH sensing by the rice nitrate transporter OsNRT2.3b is important for plant adaption to varied N supply forms and can provide a target for improving NUE.
27307441	Repair of adjacent single-strand breaks is often accompanied by the formation of tandem sequence duplications in plant genomes.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Duplication of existing sequences is a major mechanism of genome evolution. It has been previously shown that duplications can occur by replication slippage, unequal sister chromatid exchange, homologous recombination, and aberrant double-strand break-induced synthesis-dependent strand annealing reactions. In a recent study, the abundant presence of short direct repeats was documented by comparative bioinformatics analysis of different rice genomes, and the hypothesis was put forward that such duplications might arise due to the concerted repair of adjacent single-strand breaks (SSBs). Applying the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we were able to test this hypothesis experimentally in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana Using a Cas9 nickase to induce adjacent genomic SSBs in different regions of the genome (genic, intergenic, and heterochromatic) and at different distances (∼20, 50, and 100 bps), we analyzed the repair outcomes by deep sequencing. In addition to deletions, we regularly detected the formation of direct repeats close to the break sites, independent of the genomic context. The formation of these duplications as well as deletions may be associated with the presence of microhomologies. Most interestingly, we found that even the induction of two SSBs on the same DNA strand can cause genome alterations, albeit at a much lower level. Because such a scenario reflects a natural step during nucleotide excision repair, and given that the germline is set aside only late during development in plants, the repair of adjacent SSBs indeed seems to have an important influence on the shaping of plant genomes during evolution.
27436711	MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	F-box proteins constitute a large superfamily in plants and play important roles in controlling many biological processes, but the roles of F-box proteins in male meiosis in plants remain unclear. Here, we identify the rice (Oryza sativa) F-box gene MEIOTIC F-BOX (MOF), which is essential for male meiotic progression. MOF belongs to the FBX subfamily and is predominantly active during leptotene to pachytene of prophase I. mof meiocytes display disrupted telomere bouquet formation, impaired pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, and arrested meiocytes at late prophase I, followed by apoptosis. Although normal, programmed double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) form in mof mutants, foci of the phosphorylated histone variant γH2AX, a marker for DSBs, persist in the mutant, indicating that many of the DSBs remained unrepaired. The recruitment of Completion of meiosis I (COM1) and Radiation sensitive51C (RAD51C) to DSBs is severely compromised in mutant meiocytes, indicating that MOF is crucial for DSB end-processing and repair. Further analyses showed that MOF could physically interact with the rice SKP1-like Protein1 (OSK1), indicating that MOF functions as a component of the SCF E3 ligase to regulate meiotic progression in rice. Thus, this study reveals the essential role of an F-box protein in plant meiosis and provides helpful information for elucidating the roles of the ubiquitin proteasome system in plant meiotic progression.
27466405	Loss of function at RAE2, a previously unidentified EPFL, is required for awnlessness in cultivated Asian rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Domestication of crops based on artificial selection has contributed numerous beneficial traits for agriculture. Wild characteristics such as red pericarp and seed shattering were lost in both Asian (Oryza sativa) and African (Oryza glaberrima) cultivated rice species as a result of human selection on common genes. Awnedness, in contrast, is a trait that has been lost in both cultivated species due to selection on different sets of genes. In a previous report, we revealed that at least three loci regulate awn development in rice; however, the molecular mechanism underlying awnlessness remains unknown. Here we isolate and characterize a previously unidentified EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family member named REGULATOR OF AWN ELONGATION 2 (RAE2) and identify one of its requisite processing enzymes, SUBTILISIN-LIKE PROTEASE 1 (SLP1). The RAE2 precursor is specifically cleaved by SLP1 in the rice spikelet, where the mature RAE2 peptide subsequently induces awn elongation. Analysis of RAE2 sequence diversity identified a highly variable GC-rich region harboring multiple independent mutations underlying protein-length variation that disrupt the function of the RAE2 protein and condition the awnless phenotype in Asian rice. Cultivated African rice, on the other hand, retained the functional RAE2 allele despite its awnless phenotype. Our findings illuminate the molecular function of RAE2 in awn development and shed light on the independent domestication histories of Asian and African cultivated rice.
27452121	Cry1Ab-expressing rice did not influence expression of fecundity-related genes in the wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata.	2016	Gene	The impact of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin proteins on non-target predatory arthropods is not well understood at the cellular and molecular levels. Here, we investigated the potential effects of Cry1Ab expressing rice on fecundity of the wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, and some of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that brown planthoppers (BPHs) reared on Cry1Ab-expressing rice accumulated the Cry toxin and that reproductive parameters (pre-oviposition period, post-oviposition stage, number of eggs, and egg hatching rate) of the spiders that consumed BPHs reared on Bt rice were not different from those that consumed BPHs reared on the non-Bt control rice. The accumulated Cry1Ab did not influence several vitellin (Vt) parameters, including stored energy and amino acid composition, during one generation. We considered the possibility that the Cry toxins exert their influence on beneficial predators via more subtle effects detectable at the molecular level in terms of gene expression. This led us to transcriptome analysis to detect differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of spiders exposed to dietary Cry1Ab and their counterpart control spiders. Eight genes, associated with vitellogenesis, vitellogenin receptor activity, and vitellin membrane formation were not differentially expressed between ovaries from the treated and control spiders, confirmed by qPCR analysis. We infer that dietary Cry1Ab expressing rice does not influence fecundity, nor expression levels of Vt-associated genes in P. pseudoannulata.
27465023	Plasma Membrane Microdomains Are Essential for Rac1-RbohB/H-Mediated Immunity in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell	Numerous plant defense-related proteins are thought to congregate in plasma membrane microdomains, which consist mainly of sphingolipids and sterols. However, the extent to which microdomains contribute to defense responses in plants is unclear. To elucidate the relationship between microdomains and innate immunity in rice (Oryza sativa), we established lines in which the levels of sphingolipids containing 2-hydroxy fatty acids were decreased by knocking down two genes encoding fatty acid 2-hydroxylases (FAH1 and FAH2) and demonstrated that microdomains were less abundant in these lines. By testing these lines in a pathogen infection assay, we revealed that microdomains play an important role in the resistance to rice blast fungus infection. To illuminate the mechanism by which microdomains regulate immunity, we evaluated changes in protein composition, revealing that microdomains are required for the dynamics of the Rac/ROP small GTPase Rac1 and respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rbohs) in response to chitin elicitor. Furthermore, FAHs are essential for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after chitin treatment. Together with the observation that RbohB, a defense-related NADPH oxidase that interacts with Rac1, is localized in microdomains, our data indicate that microdomains are required for chitin-induced immunity through ROS signaling mediated by the Rac1-RbohB pathway.
27468891	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	2016	Plant Cell	Plants have evolved complicated protective mechanisms to survive adverse conditions. Previously, we reported that the transcription factor OsbZIP46 regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling-mediated drought tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) by modulating stress-related genes. An intrinsic D domain represses OsbZIP46 activity, but the detailed mechanism for the repression of OsbZIP46 activation remains unknown. Here, we report an OsbZIP46-interacting protein, MODD (Mediator of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation), which is homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5)-binding protein AFP. MODD was induced by ABA and drought stress, but the induction was much slower than that of OsbZIP46. In contrast to OsbZIP46, MODD negatively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance, and inhibits the expression of OsbZIP46 target genes. We found that MODD negatively regulates OsbZIP46 activity and stability. MODD represses OsbZIP46 activity via interaction with the OsTPR3-HDA702 co-repressor complex and down-regulation of the histone acetylation level at OsbZIP46 target genes. MODD promotes OsbZIP46 degradation via interaction with the U-box type ubiquitin E3 ligase OsPUB70. Interestingly, the D domain is required for both deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 via its interaction with MODD. These findings show that plants fine-tune their drought responses by elaborate regulatory mechanisms, including the coordination of activity and stability of key transcription factors.
27535938	Extensive sequence divergence between the reference genomes of two elite indica rice varieties Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Asian cultivated rice consists of two subspecies: Oryza sativa subsp. indica and O. sativa subsp. japonica Despite the fact that indica rice accounts for over 70% of total rice production worldwide and is genetically much more diverse, a high-quality reference genome for indica rice has yet to be published. We conducted map-based sequencing of two indica rice lines, Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Minghui 63 (MH63), which represent the two major varietal groups of the indica subspecies and are the parents of an elite Chinese hybrid. The genome sequences were assembled into 237 (ZS97) and 181 (MH63) contigs, with an accuracy >99.99%, and covered 90.6% and 93.2% of their estimated genome sizes. Comparative analyses of these two indica genomes uncovered surprising structural differences, especially with respect to inversions, translocations, presence/absence variations, and segmental duplications. Approximately 42% of nontransposable element related genes were identical between the two genomes. Transcriptome analysis of three tissues showed that 1,059-2,217 more genes were expressed in the hybrid than in the parents and that the expressed genes in the hybrid were much more diverse due to their divergence between the parental genomes. The public availability of two high-quality reference genomes for the indica subspecies of rice will have large-ranging implications for plant biology and crop genetic improvement.
27500524	Domestication history and geographical adaptation inferred from a SNP map of African rice.	2016	Nat Genet	African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) is a cereal crop species closely related to Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) but was independently domesticated in West Africa ∼3,000 years ago. African rice is rarely grown outside sub-Saharan Africa but is of global interest because of its tolerance to abiotic stresses. Here we describe a map of 2.32 million SNPs of African rice from whole-genome resequencing of 93 landraces. Population genomic analysis shows a population bottleneck in this species that began ∼13,000-15,000 years ago with effective population size reaching its minimum value ∼3,500 years ago, suggesting a protracted period of population size reduction likely commencing with predomestication management and/or cultivation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six salt tolerance traits identify 11 significant loci, 4 of which are within ∼300 kb of genomic regions that possess signatures of positive selection, suggesting adaptive geographical divergence for salt tolerance in this species.
27258572	Combined herbicide and saline stress differentially modulates hormonal regulation and antioxidant defense system in Oryza sativa cultivars.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Plants are simultaneously exposed to a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses in field conditions. Crops respond to the combined stress in a unique way which cannot be understood by extrapolating the results of individual stress. In the present study, effects of individual and combined stress of herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and salinity (NaCl) on two Oryza sativa cultivars (ZJ 88 and XS 134) were investigated. Both herbicide and saline stress affected the plant growth differentially and produced oxidative stress in rice cultivars. Interestingly, the combination of herbicide and salinity showed a significant protection to both rice cultivars by reducing ROS (H2O2, O2(-)) and lipid peroxidation through modulation of enzymatic (SOD, POD, CAT and APX) and non-enzymatic (TSP, sugars, phenolic and proline) antioxidants. In addition, active regulation of transcript levels of genes encoding Na(+) and K(+) (OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a,b, OsHKT2;1, OsSOS1, OsCNGC1, OsNHX1 and OsAKT1) transporter proteins reduced sodium and enhanced potassium accumulation under combined stress, resulted a better growth and ionic homeostasis in both rice cultivars. The production of ABA and IAA was significantly higher in cultivar XS 134 compared to cultivar ZJ 88 under control conditions. However, combined herbicide and saline stress enhanced the accumulation of phytohormones (IAA and ABA) and transcription of ethylene in cultivar ZJ 88, which might be one of the factors responsible for poor salt tolerance in sensitive cultivar. These findings indicated that herbicide application under saline stress confers tolerance to salinity in rice cultivars, likely by reducing oxidative damage, modulating mineral absorption, upgradation of antioxidant defense and by dynamic regulation of key genes involved in Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis in plants.
27133784	Imprinted gene OsFIE1 modulates rice seed development by influencing nutrient metabolism and modifying genome H3K27me3.	2016	Plant J	Imprinted Polycomb group (PcG) genes play a critical role in seed development in Arabidopsis. However, the role of the imprinted gene in cereal plants remains obscure. Here, a transgenic approach was conducted to study the function of the imprinted gene Oryza sativa Fertilization-Independent Endosperm 1 (OsFIE1) during seed development in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica 'ZhongHua11'). RNAi of OsFIE1 and homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant osfie1 led to smaller seeds, delayed embryo development, smaller aleurone layer cells, and decreased seed set rate. OsFIE1 was specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 was also enriched in the inner seed coat together with the corresponding PcG members OsiEZ1 and OsCLF. Meanwhile, the contents of seed storage proteins and Ile, Leu, and Val were decreased, accompanied by the down-regulation of multiple transcription factors, storage protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism-related genes in OsFIE1-RNAi lines and osfie1. Western blot analysis showed that the complex OsFIE1-PcG in endosperm regulated the expression of target genes by genome H3K27me3 modification. We conclude that the OsFIE1-PcG complex, which was enriched in the inner seed coat and endosperm linked the development of embryo and endosperm by influencing transcription factors and nutrient metabolism and induced a highly differential effect when compared with the OsFIE2-PcG complex.
27103216	Thiamine-induced priming against root-knot nematode infection in rice involves lignification and hydrogen peroxide generation.	2016	Mol Plant Pathol	Thiamine (vitamin B1, VB1) can act as a plant defence trigger, or priming agent, leading to a rapid counterattack on pathogen invasion. In this study, the priming effect of thiamine on rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) and its activity against root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infection were evaluated. Thiamine treatment and subsequent nematode inoculation activated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and lignin deposition in plant roots, and this correlated with enhanced transcription of OsPAL1 and OsC4H, two genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The number of nematodes in rice roots was slightly but significantly reduced, and the development of the nematodes was delayed, whereas no direct toxic effects of VB1 on nematode viability and infectivity were observed. The combined application of thiamine with l-2-aminooxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (AOPP), an inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), significantly hampered the VB1-priming capacity. These findings indicate that thiamine-induced priming in rice involves H2O2 and phenylpropanoid-mediated lignin production, which hampers nematode infection. Further cellular and molecular studies on the mechanism of thiamine-induced defence will be useful for the development of novel nematode control strategies.
27185545	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	2016	Sci Rep	Thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) is a major H2O2-scavenging enzyme. To clarify its functions in tolerance to rice bacterial blight, we produced rice lines overexpressing and suppressing tAPX (OsAPX8). The overexpressing lines exhibited increased tolerance to bacterial pathogen. The RNA interference (RNAi) lines were considerably more sensitive than the control plant. Further analysis of the H2O2 content in these transgenic plants indicated that the H2O2 accumulation of OsAPX8-overexpressing plants was considerably less than that of wild-type and RNAi plants upon challenge with bacterial pathogen. Interestingly, H2O2 was the most important factor for the serious leaf dehydration and withering of rice without major resistance genes and was not the cause of hypersensitivity. It addition, wall tightening or loosening can occur according to the level of H2O2. In addition, OsAPX8 interacted with the susceptibility protein Os8N3/Xa13, and their binding repressed the reaction of OsAPX8 in tolerance to bacterial blight.
27297988	OsHSD1, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, is involved in cuticle formation and lipid homeostasis in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Cuticular wax, a hydrophobic layer on the surface of all aerial plant organs, has essential roles in plant growth and survival under various environments. Here we report a wax-deficient rice mutant oshsd1 with reduced epicuticular wax crystals and thicker cuticle membrane. Quantification of the wax components and fatty acids showed elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and accumulation of soluble fatty acids in the leaves of the oshsd1 mutant. We determined the causative gene OsHSD1, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase family, through map-based cloning. It was ubiquitously expressed and responded to cold stress and exogenous treatments with NaCl or brassinosteroid analogs. Transient expression of OsHSD1-tagged green fluorescent protein revealed that OsHSD1 localized to both oil bodies and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dehydrogenase activity assays demonstrated that OsHSD1 was an NAD(+)/NADP(+)-dependent sterol dehydrogenase. Furthermore, OsHSD1 mutation resulted in faster protein degradation, but had no effect on the dehydrogenase activity. Together, our data indicated that OsHSD1 plays a specialized role in cuticle formation and lipid homeostasis, probably by mediating sterol signaling. This work provides new insights into oil-body associated proteins involved in wax and lipid metabolism.
27335352	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of jasmonic acid (JA) responses and play a crucial role in the regulation of host immunity in plants. Here, we report that OsMYC2, a JAZ-interacting transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa L.), plays an important role in the resistance response against rice bacterial blight, which is one of the most serious diseases in rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that OsMYC2 interacted with some OsJAZ proteins in a JAZ-interacting domain (JID)-dependent manner. The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYC2 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and were more resistant to Xoo. A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes. OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes. The nuclear localization of OsMYC2 depended on a nuclear localization signal within JID. Overall, we conclude that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of early JA signals in the JA-induced resistance against Xoo in rice.
26829663	Seedling stage low temperature response in tolerant and susceptible rice genotypes suggests role of relative water content and members of OsSNAC gene family.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Low temperature (LT) severely affects rice growth and grain yield. Recently, we reported contrasting genotypes including ARR 09 and Takyer for seedling stage long duration low temperature response. Here we show that susceptible rice genotypes show an increase in lipid peroxide levels and decrease in relative water content (RWC) to a higher extent in comparison to tolerant genotypes in response to 3 h LT. Stress induced NAC family members (OsNAC1, OsNAC2, OsNAC3, and OsNAC5) showed a higher transcript accumulation in tolerant genotypes than in sensitive genotypes after LT treatment suggesting stress tolerance might be due to higher expression of stress-responsive transcription factors. Furthermore, ARR 09 can be used as an important genetic resource to better understand LT tolerance mechanism.
27303902	Plant-specific DUF1110 protein from Oryza sativa: expression, purification and crystallization.	2016	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	The Os01T0156300 protein from Oryza sativa has been classified into the domain of unknown function (DUF) family DUF1110. DUF1110 family members exist in monocotyledons but not in dicotyledons, and share no sequence identity with proteins for which structures have been reported. In this study, the Os01T0156300 protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.84 Å resolution. The crystal belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 89.9, b = 89.8, c = 107.1 Å, β = 106.6°. The asymmetric unit was estimated to contain 6-11 molecules.
27214086	Enhanced cadmium accumulation and tolerance in transgenic tobacco overexpressing rice metal tolerance protein gene OsMTP1 is promising for phytoremediation.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	One of the most grievous heavy metal pollutants in the environment is cadmium (Cd), which is not only responsible for the crop yield loss owing to its phytotoxicity, but also for the human health hazards as the toxic elements usually accumulate in the consumable parts of crop plants. In the present study, we aimed to isolate and functionally characterize the OsMTP1 gene from indica rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR64) to study its potential application for efficient phytoremediation of Cd. The 1257 bp coding DNA sequence (CDS) of OsMTP1 encodes a ∼46 kDa protein belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) or metal tolerance/transport protein (MTP) family. The OsMTP1 transcript in rice plant was found to respond during external Cd stress. Heterologous expression of OsMTP1 in tobacco resulted in the reduction of Cd stress-induced phytotoxic effects, including growth inhibition, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Compared to untransformed control, the transgenic tobacco plants showed enhanced vacuolar thiol content, indicating vacuolar localization of the sequestered Cd. The transgenic tobacco plants exhibited significantly higher biomass growth (2.2-2.8-folds) and hyperaccumulation of Cd (1.96-2.22-folds) compared to untransformed control under Cd exposure. The transgenic plants also showed moderate tolerance and accumulation of arsenic (As) upon exogenous As stress, signifying broad substrate specificity of OsMTP1. Together, findings of our research suggest that the transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsMTP1 with its hyperaccumulating activity and increased growth rate could be useful for future phytoremediation applications to clean up the Cd-contaminated soil.
27238968	Molecular Mechanism for Fungal Cell Wall Recognition by Rice Chitin Receptor OsCEBiP.	2016	Structure	Chitin is the major component of fungal cell wall and serves as a molecular pattern that can be recognized by the receptor OsCEBiP in rice, a lysine motif (LysM) receptor-like protein (RLP), to trigger immune responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying chitin recognition remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the ectodomain of OsCEBiP (OsCEBiP-ECD) in free and chitin-bound forms. The structures reveal that OsCEBiP-ECD contains three tandem LysMs followed by a novel structure fold of cysteine-rich domain. The structures showed that chitin binding induces no striking conformational changes in OsCEBiP. Structural comparison among N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) oligomer-bound LysMs revealed a highly conserved recognition mechanism, which is expected to facilitate study of other LysM-containing proteins for their NAG binding. Modeling study showed that chitin induces OsCEBiP homodimerization in a "sliding mode". Our data provide insights into rice chitin receptor-mediated immunity triggered by fungal cell wall.
27208249	Analysis of Chromatin Regulators Reveals Specific Features of Rice DNA Methylation Pathways.	2016	Plant Physiol	Plant DNA methylation that occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH sites (H = A, C, or T) is a hallmark of the repression of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TEs). The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains about 40% repetitive sequence and TEs and displays specific patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation. The mechanism responsible for the specific methylation patterns is unclear. Here, we analyzed the function of OsDDM1 (Deficient in DNA Methylation 1) and OsDRM2 (Deficient in DNA Methylation 1) in genome-wide DNA methylation, TE repression, small RNA accumulation, and gene expression. We show that OsDDM1 is essential for high levels of methylation at CHG and, to a lesser extent, CG sites in heterochromatic regions and also is required for CHH methylation that mainly locates in the genic regions of the genome. In addition to a large member of TEs, loss of OsDDM1 leads to hypomethylation and up-regulation of many protein-coding genes, producing very severe growth phenotypes at the initial generation. Importantly, we show that OsDRM2 mutation results in a nearly complete loss of CHH methylation and derepression of mainly small TE-associated genes and that OsDDM1 is involved in facilitating OsDRM2-mediated CHH methylation. Thus, the function of OsDDM1 and OsDRM2 defines distinct DNA methylation pathways in the bulk of DNA methylation of the genome, which is possibly related to the dispersed heterochromatin across chromosomes in rice and suggests that DNA methylation mechanisms may vary among different plant species.
27228336	Phosphorus remobilization from rice flag leaves during grain filling: an RNA-seq study.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The physiology and molecular regulation of phosphorus (P) remobilization from vegetative tissues to grains during grain filling is poorly understood, despite the pivotal role it plays in the global P cycle. To test the hypothesis that a subset of genes involved in the P starvation response are involved in remobilization of P from flag leaves to developing grains, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis of rice flag leaves during the preremobilization phase (6 DAA) and when the leaves were acting as a P source (15 DAA). Several genes that respond to phosphate starvation, including three purple acid phosphatases (OsPAP3, OsPAP9b and OsPAP10a), were significantly up-regulated at 15 DAA, consistent with a role in remobilization of P from flag leaves during grain filling. A number of genes that have not been implicated in the phosphate starvation response, OsPAP26, SPX-MFS1 (a putative P transporter) and SPX-MFS2, also showed expression profiles consistent with involvement in P remobilization from senescing flag leaves. Metabolic pathway analysis using the KEGG system suggested plastid membrane lipid synthesis is a critical process during the P remobilization phase. In particular, the up-regulation of OsPLDz2 and OsSQD2 at 15 DAA suggested phospholipids were being degraded and replaced by other lipids to enable continued cellular function while liberating P for export to developing grains. Three genes associated with RNA degradation that have not previously been implicated in the P starvation response also showed expression profiles consistent with a role in P mobilization from senescing flag leaves.
27208278	Regulatory Role of a Receptor-Like Kinase in Specifying Anther Cell Identity.	2016	Plant Physiol	In flowering plants, sequential formation of anther cell types is a highly ordered process that is essential for successful meiosis and sexual reproduction. Differentiation of meristematic cells and cell-cell communication are proposed to coordinate anther development. Among the proposed mechanisms of cell fate specification are cell surface-localized Leu-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and their putative ligands. Here, we present the genetic and biochemical evidence that a rice (Oryza sativa) LRR-RLK, MSP1 (MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE1), interacts with its ligand OsTDL1A (TPD1-like 1A), specifying the cell identity of anther wall layers and microsporocytes. An in vitro assay indicates that the 21-amino acid peptide of OsTDL1A has a physical interaction with the LRR domain of MSP1. The ostdl1a msp1 double mutant showed the defect in lacking middle layers and tapetal cells and having an increased number of microsporocytes similar to the ostdl1a or msp1 single mutant, indicating the same pathway of OsTDL1A-MSP1 in regulating anther development. Genome-wide expression profiles showed the altered expression of genes encoding transcription factors, particularly basic helix-loop-helix and basic leucine zipper domain transcription factors in ostdl1a and msp1 Among these reduced expressed genes, one putatively encodes a TGA (TGACGTCA cis-element-binding protein) factor OsTGA10, and another one encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin OsGrx_I1. OsTGA10 was shown to interact with OsGrx_I1, suggesting that OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling specifies anther cell fate directly or indirectly affecting redox status. Collectively, these data point to a central role of the OsTDL1A-MSP1 signaling pathway in specifying somatic cell identity and suppressing overproliferation of archesporial cells in rice.
27143046	Jasmonate signaling is activated in the very early stages of iron deficiency responses in rice roots.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Under low iron availability, plants induce the expression of various genes involved in iron uptake and translocation at the transcriptional level. This iron deficiency response is affected by various plant hormones, but the roles of jasmonates in this response are not well-known. We investigated the involvement of jasmonates in rice iron deficiency responses. High rates of jasmonate-inducible genes were induced during the very early stages of iron deficiency treatment in rice roots. Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1. Ten out of 35 genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling were rapidly induced at 3 h of iron deficiency treatment, and this induction preceded that of known iron deficiency-inducible genes involved in iron uptake and translocation. Twelve genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling were also upregulated in HRZ-knockdown roots. Endogenous concentrations of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl isoleucine tended to be rapidly increased in roots in response to iron deficiency treatment, whereas these concentrations were higher in HRZ-knockdown roots under iron-sufficient conditions. Analysis of the jasmonate-deficient cpm2 mutant revealed that jasmonates repress the expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes involved in iron uptake and translocation under iron sufficiency, but this repression is partly canceled under an early stage of iron deficiency. These results indicate that jasmonate signaling is activated during the very early stages of iron deficiency, which is partly regulated by IDEF1 and OsHRZs.
27302336	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	2016	Plant J	Expansins are cell wall loosening proteins, which are encoded by multigene families. However, the physiological role of most expansin genes is still poorly understood. Here, we functionally characterized an Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10, which is regulated by a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor, ART1 in rice. A detailed expression analysis showed that OsEXPA10 was expressed in both the roots and shoots at a similar level, but only the expression in the roots was rapidly upregulated in response to Al. Furthermore, spatial expression analysis showed that the Al-induced expression was only found in the root tips (0-3 mm), but not in the mature root zones. The expression was neither induced by other metals including Cd and La nor by low pH. Immunostaining showed that OsEXPA10 was localized at all cells of the root tips. Knockout of OsEXPA10 resulted in a significant decrease in the cell elongation of the roots in the absence of Al. In the presence of Al, knockout of OsEXPA10 did not alter the Al sensitivity evaluated by relative root elongation, but the root cell wall of knockout lines accumulated less Al compared to those of the wild-type rice. Collectively, our results indicate that OsEXPA10 expressed in the root tips is required for the root cell elongation, but that the contribution of this gene to high Al tolerance in rice is small.
27350219	Heterologous expression of a rice miR395 gene in Nicotiana tabacum impairs sulfate homeostasis.	2016	Sci Rep	Sulfur participates in many important mechanisms and pathways of plant development. The most common source of sulfur in soil -SO4(2-)- is absorbed into root tissue and distributed into aerial part through vasculature system, where it is reduced into sulfite and finally sulfide within the subcellular organs such as chloroplasts and mitochondria and used for cysteine and methionine biosynthesis. MicroRNAs are involved in many regulation pathways by repressing the expression of their target genes. MiR395 family in Arabidopsis thaliana has been reported to be an important regulator involved in sulfate transport and assimilation, and a high-affinity sulphate transporter and three ATP sulfurylases (ATPS) were the target genes of AthmiR395 (Arabidopsis thaliana miR395). We have cloned a miR395 gene from rice (Oryza sativa) and studied its function in plant nutritional response. Our results indicated that in rice, transcript level of OsamiR395 (Oryza sativa miR395) increased under sulfate deficiency conditions, and the two predicted target genes of miR395 were down-regulated under the same conditions. Overexpression of OsamiR395h in tobacco impaired its sulfate homeostasis, and sulfate distribution was also slightly impacted among leaves of different ages. One sulfate transporter (SULTR) gene NtaSULTR2 was identified to be the target of miR395 in Nicotiana tobacum, which belongs to low affinity sulfate transporter group. Both miR395 and NtaSULTR2 respond to sulfate starvation in tobacco.
27258121	Multiple Patterns of Regulation and Overexpression of a Ribonuclease-Like Pathogenesis-Related Protein Gene, OsPR10a, Conferring Disease Resistance in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	PLoS One	An abundant 17 kDa RNase, encoded by OsPR10a (also known as PBZ1), was purified from Pi-starved rice suspension-cultured cells. Biochemical analysis showed that the range of optimal temperature for its RNase activity was 40-70°C and the optimum pH was 5.0. Disulfide bond formation and divalent metal ion Mg2+ were required for the RNase activity. The expression of OsPR10a::GUS in transgenic rice was induced upon phosphate (Pi) starvation, wounding, infection by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), leaf senescence, anther, style, the style-ovary junction, germinating embryo and shoot. We also provide first evidence in whole-plant system, demonstrated that OsPR10a-overexpressing in rice and Arabidopsis conferred significant level of enhanced resistance to infection by the pathogen Xoo and Xanthomona campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), respectively. Transgenic rice and Arabidopsis overexpressing OsPR10a significantly increased the length of primary root under phosphate deficiency (-Pi) condition. These results showed that OsPR10a might play multiple roles in phosphate recycling in phosphate-starved cells and senescing leaves, and could improve resistance to pathogen infection and/or against chewing insect pests. It is possible that Pi acquisition or homeostasis is associated with plant disease resistance. Our findings suggest that gene regulation of OsPR10a could act as a good model system to unravel the mechanisms behind the correlation between Pi starvation and plant-pathogen interactions, and also provides a potential application in crops disease resistance.
27306456	A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsHIGDs was identified as a novel hypoxia-responsive protein family. Among them, OsHIGD2 is characterized as a mitochondrial protein and is related to hypoxia signalling through interacting with mitochondrial proteins of critical functions in reducing cell damages caused by hypoxia. Recent evidence supports ethylene as a key factor in modulating plant responses to submergence stress. Meanwhile, there has been general consent that ethylene is not the only signal for the submergence-induced stem growth. In this study, we confirmed that hypoxia also promotes stem elongation in deepwater rice even in the absence of ethylene. As components of ethylene-independent hypoxia signalling, five HIGD (hypoxia-induced gene domain) protein genes were identified. Among the genes, OsHIGD2 showed the fastest and strongest induction by hypoxia as well as submergence. Co-expression analysis indicated that OsHIGD2 had a simultaneous expression pattern with fermentation-related genes, such as ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) and PDC2 (pyruvate decarboxylase 2). Transient expression of OsHIGD2 in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence that the protein is localized to mitochondria. We further identified OsHIGD2-interacting proteins through the yeast two-hybrid assay using OsHIGD2 as bait. As a result, three mitochondrial proteins were discovered that function in the regulation of redox potential or reduction of protein damages caused by reactive oxygen species. In this report, we propose that OsHIGD2 is a mitochondrial protein which takes part in the early stage of hypoxia signalling by interacting with proteins that are related to oxygen utilization.
27265035	Interactions of Oryza sativa OsCONTINUOUS VASCULAR RING-LIKE 1 (OsCOLE1) and OsCOLE1-INTERACTING PROTEIN reveal a novel intracellular auxin transport mechanism.	2016	New Phytol	Little is known about the transport mechanism of intracellular auxin. Here, we report two vacuole-localized proteins, Oryza sativa OsCONTINUOUS VASCULAR RING-LIKE 1 (OsCOLE1) and OsCOLE1-INTERACTING PROTEIN (OsCLIP), that regulate intracellular auxin transport and homoeostasis. Overexpression of OsCOLE1 markedly increased the internode length and auxin content of the stem base, whereas these parameters were decreased in RNA interference (RNAi) plants. OsCOLE1 was localized on the tonoplast and preferentially expressed in mature tissues. We further identified its interacting protein OsCLIP, which was co-localized on the tonoplast. Protein-protein binding assays demonstrated that the N-terminus of OsCOLE1 directly interacted with OsCLIP in yeast cells and the rice protoplast. Furthermore, (3) H-indole-3-acetic acid ((3) H-IAA) transport assays revealed that OsCLIP transported IAA into yeast cells, which was promoted by OsCOLE1. The results indicate that OsCOLE1 affects rice development by regulating intracellular auxin transport through interaction with OsCLIP, which provides a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of intracellular transport of auxin and the roles of vacuoles in plant development.
27171233	Regulatory role of the OsWOX3A transcription factor in rice root development.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) transcription factors play important roles in cell fate determination during plant development and function in the signaling pathways of phytohormones such as gibberellic acid (GA). In a recent study, we demonstrated that OsWOX3A directly binds to the promoter of the KAO gene, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, and represses KAO expression. Interestingly, we observed that OsWOX3A overexpression causes not only severe dwarfism, but also an increase in the number of lateral roots. Moreover, the expression of PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1), involved in polar auxin transport, is significantly upregulated in OsWOX3A-OX plants. These findings indicate that OsWOX3A may be involved in modulation of GA-auxin crosstalk in rice root development.
27258066	OsLBD3-7 Overexpression Induced Adaxially Rolled Leaves in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Appropriate leaf rolling enhances erect-leaf habits and photosynthetic efficiency, which consequently improves grain yield. Here, we reported the novel lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) gene OsLBD3-7, which is involved in the regulation of leaf rolling. OsLBD3-7 works as a transcription activator and its protein is located on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsLBD3-7 leads to narrow and adaxially rolled leaves. Microscopy of flag leaf cross-sections indicated that overexpression of OsLBD3-7 led to a decrease in both bulliform cell size and number. Transcriptional analysis showed that key genes that had been reported to be negative regulators of bulliform cell development were up-regulated in transgenic plants. These results indicated that OsLBD3-7 might acts as an upstream regulatory gene of bulliform cell development to regulate leaf rolling, which will give more insights on the leaf rolling regulation mechanism.
27300023	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsWRKY51 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator in defense signaling against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by direct DNA binding to the promoter of defense related gene, OsPR10a. OsWRKY51 in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is induced by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To examine the role of OsWRKY51 in the defense response of rice, we generated OsWRKY51 overexpressing and underexpressing transgenic rice plants. OsWRKY51-overexpressing transgenic rice lines were more resistant to Xoo and showed greater expression of defense-related genes than wild-type (WT) plants, while OsWRKY51-underexpressing lines were more susceptible to Xoo and showed less expression of defense-associated genes than WT plants. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY51 showed growth retardation compared to WT plants. In contrast, transgenic lines underexpressing OsWRKY51 by RNA interference showed similar plant height with WT plants. Transient expression of OsWRKY51-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in rice protoplasts revealed that OsWRKY51 was localized in the nucleus. OsWRKY51 bound to the W-box and WLE1 elements of the OsPR10a promoter. Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling.
27325665	Feedback Regulation of ABA Signaling and Biosynthesis by a bZIP Transcription Factor Targets Drought-Resistance-Related Genes.	2016	Plant Physiol	The OsbZIP23 transcription factor has been characterized for its essential role in drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, we first investigated the transcriptional activation of OsbZIP23. A homolog of SnRK2 protein kinase (SAPK2) was found to interact with and phosphorylate OsbZIP23 for its transcriptional activation. SAPK2 also interacted with OsPP2C49, an ABI1 homolog, which deactivated the SAPK2 to inhibit the transcriptional activation activity of OsbZIP23. Next, we performed genome-wide identification of OsbZIP23 targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing analyses in the OsbZIP23-overexpression, osbzip23 mutant, and wild-type rice under normal and drought stress conditions. OsbZIP23 directly regulates a large number of reported genes that function in stress response, hormone signaling, and developmental processes. Among these targets, we found that OsbZIP23 could positively regulate OsPP2C49, and overexpression of OsPP2C49 in rice resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity of the abscisic acid (ABA) response and rapid dehydration. Moreover, OsNCED4 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase4), a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, was also positively regulated by OsbZIP23. Together, our results suggest that OsbZIP23 acts as a central regulator in ABA signaling and biosynthesis, and drought resistance in rice.
27300553	Phylogenetic Analysis, Lineage-Specific Expansion and Functional Divergence of seed dormancy 4-Like Genes in Plants.	2016	PLoS One	The rice gene seed dormancy 4 (OsSdr4) functions in seed dormancy and is a major factor associated with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). Although previous studies of this protein family were reported for rice and other species, knowledge of the evolution of genes homologous to OsSdr4 in plants remains inadequate. Fifty four Sdr4-like (hereafter designated Sdr4L) genes were identified in nine plant lineages including 36 species. Phylogenetic analysis placed these genes in eight subfamilies (I-VIII). Genes from the same lineage clustered together, supported by analysis of conserved motifs and exon-intron patterns. Segmental duplications were present in both dicot and monocot clusters, while tandemly duplicated genes occurred only in monocot clusters indicating that both tandem and segmental duplications contributed to expansion of the grass I and II subfamilies. Estimation of the approximate ages of the duplication events indicated that ancestral Sdr4 genes evolved from a common angiosperm ancestor, about 160 million years ago (MYA). Moreover, diversification of Sdr4L genes in mono and dicot plants was mainly associated with genome-wide duplication and speciation events. Functional divergence was observed in all subfamily pairs, except IV/VIIIa. Further analysis indicated that functional constraints between subfamily pairs I/II, I/VIIIb, II/VI, II/VIIIb, II/IV, and VI/VIIIb were statistically significant. Site and branch-site model analyses of positive selection suggested that these genes were under strong adaptive selection pressure. Critical amino acids detected for both functional divergence and positive selection were mostly located in the loops, pointing to functional importance of these regions in this protein family. In addition, differential expression studies by transcriptome atlas of 11 Sdr4L genes showed that the duplicated genes may have undergone divergence in expression between plant species. Our findings showed that Sdr4L genes are functionally divergent and positively selected. These may contribute to further functional analysis and molecular evolution of Sdr4L gene families in land plants.
27379617	Silenced rice in both cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases displays pre-acclimation to cope with oxidative stress induced by 3-aminotriazole-inhibited catalase.	2016	J Plant Physiol	The maintenance of H2O2 homeostasis and signaling mechanisms in plant subcellular compartments is greatly dependent on cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (APX1 and APX2) and peroxisomal catalase (CAT) activities. APX1/2 knockdown plants were utilized in this study to clarify the role of increased cytosolic H2O2 levels as a signal to trigger the antioxidant defense system against oxidative stress generated in peroxisomes after 3-aminotriazole-inhibited catalase (CAT). Before supplying 3-AT, silenced APX1/2 plants showed marked changes in their oxidative and antioxidant profiles in comparison to NT plants. After supplying 3-AT, APX1/2 plants triggered up-expression of genes belonging to APX (OsAPX7 and OsAPX8) and GPX families (OsGPX1, OsGPX2, OsGPX3 and OsGPX5), but to a lower extent than in NT plants. In addition, APX1/2 exhibited lower glycolate oxidase (GO) activity, higher CO2 assimilation, higher cellular integrity and higher oxidation of GSH, whereas the H2O2 and lipid peroxidation levels remained unchanged. This evidence indicates that redox pre-acclimation displayed by silenced rice contributed to coping with oxidative stress generated by 3-AT. We suggest that APX1/2 plants were able to trigger alternative oxidative and antioxidant mechanisms involving signaling by H2O2, allowing these plants to display effective physiological responses for protection against oxidative damage generated by 3-AT, compared to non-transformed plants.
27332964	OVATE Family Protein 8 Positively Mediates Brassinosteroid Signaling through Interacting with the GSK3-like Kinase in Rice.	2016	PLoS Genet	OVATE gene was first identified as a key regulator of fruit shape in tomato. OVATE family proteins (OFPs) are characterized as plant-specific transcription factors and conserved in Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. Roles of OFPs involved in plant development and growth are largely unknown. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones involved in diverse biological functions. OsGKS2 plays a critical role in BR signaling by phosphorylating downstream components such as OsBZR1 and DLT. Here we report in rice that OsOFP8 plays a positive role in BR signaling pathway. BL treatment induced the expression of OsOFP8 and led to enhanced accumulation of OsOFP8 protein. The gain-of-function mutant Osofp8 and OsOFP8 overexpression lines showed enhanced lamina joint inclination, whereas OsOFP8 RNAi transgenic lines showed more upright leaf phenotype, which suggest that OsOFP8 is involved in BR responses. Further analyses indicated that OsGSK2 interacts with and phosphorylates OsOFP8. BRZ treatment resulted in the cytoplasmic distribution of OsOFP8, and bikinin treatment reduced the cytoplasmic accumulation of OsOFP8. Phosphorylation of OsOFP8 by OsGSK2 is needed for its nuclear export. The phospphorylated OsOFP8 shuttles to the cytoplasm and is targeted for proteasomal degradation. These results indicate that OsOFP8 is a substrate of OsGSK2 and the function of OsOFP8 in plant growth and development is at least partly through the BR signaling pathway.
27339321	Characterization of OsLEA1a and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.	2016	Int J Biol Macromol	OsLEA1a is a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein gene from Oryza sativa L, which contains an open reading frame of 282-bp that encodes a putative polypeptide of 93 amino acids. OsLEA1a protein contains abundant of Lys, Ala, Glu, Asp, Gly, Arg and Leu, but depleted in Cys, His, Phe, Trp and Tyr residues; and is strongly hydrophilic. OsLEA1a includes six helical domains and a β-sheet domain. Real-time PCR analysis showed that OsLEA1a was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period. To make sense of OsLEA1a functions, TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein expression vector and OsLEA1a protein expression vector were transformed into Escherichia coli DL21 (DE3), respectively. The accumulation of the TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein or OsLEA1a protein interfered with the resistance of E. coli to high salinity, metal ions, hyperosmotic, oxidation, heat and freeze-thaw stresses. The purified TrxA-OsLEA1a fusion protein reduced stabilization of LDH and increased damage of diverse abiotic stresses to LDH. The findings suggested that the OsLEA1a may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses.
27375203	A Small G Protein as a Novel Component of the Rice Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction.	2016	Mol Plant	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones that are essential for plant growth and development. The BR signal transduction pathway in the dicot model plant Arabidopsis is well established, but the components connecting the BR signaling steps in rice have not been fully explored. For example, how the BR signaling is fine-tuned in rice, especially at the BR receptor level, is largely unknown. Here we show that OsPRA2, a rice small G protein, plays a repressive role in the BR signaling pathway. Lamina inclination, coleoptile elongation, and root inhibition assays indicated that rice plants with suppressed expression of OsPRA2 were more sensitive to exogenously applied brassinolide than the wild-type plants. Conversely, rice overexpressing OsPRA2 was less sensitive to exogenous brassinolide. Further study uncovered that OsPRA2 inhibited the dephosphorylation of, and thus inactivated the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1). More importantly, OsPRA2 was found to co-localize with and directly bind to rice BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (OsBRI1) at the plasma membrane. Additionally, the in vitro assays showed that OsPRA2 inhibits its autophosphorylation. This OsPRA2-OsBRI1 interaction led to the dissociation of OsBRI1 from its co-receptor OsBAK1, and abolished OsBRI1-mediated phosphorylation of OsBAK1. Together, these results reveal a possible working mechanism of OsPRA2 as a novel negative regulator on OsBRI1 and OsBZR1 and extend the knowledge about the regulatory mechanism of rice BR signaling.
27257291	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Plants have evolved two distinct strategies to acquire iron (Fe) from soils. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the Fe acquisition remain largely elusive. There is emerging evidence that small GTPases are involved in the responses of plants to environmental cues. Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a OsRab6a shared conserved functional domains with other known members of the Rab subfamily and localized ubiquitously in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The expression of OsRab6a was rapidly and transiently up-regulated by Fe deficiency. No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi (RNA interference) and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium. However, overexpression of OsRab6a in rice plants conferred greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, and greater biomass, Chl contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines than wild-type and RNAi plants. Moreover, the overexpression lines exhibited larger root systems than wild-type and RNAi plants in Fe-deficient medium. Exposure to Fe-deficient medium led to up-regulation of OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 in both wild-type and transgenic rice plants, with the magnitude of up-regulation positively correlated with the expression levels of OsRab6a These results may suggest that OsRab6a plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium.
27457997	Identification of a peroxisomal-targeted aldolase involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and sugar metabolism in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Chlorophyll plays remarkable and critical roles in photosynthetic light-harvesting, energy transduction and plant development. In this study, we identified a rice Chl-deficient mutant, ygdl-1 (yellow green and droopy leaf-1), which showed yellow-green leaves throughout plant development with decreased content of Chls and carotene and an increased Chl a/b ratio. The ygdl-1 mutant also exhibited severe defects in chloroplast development, including disorganized grana stacks. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant contained a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (OsAld-Y), which dramatically reduced the OsAld-Y mRNA level, and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development were concurrently altered in the ygdl-1 mutant. The expression of OsAld-Y-GFP fusion protein in tobacco epidermal cells showed that OsAld-Y was localized to the peroxisome. In addition, the analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed the significantly reduced levels of sucrose and fructose in the mutant leaves, while the glucose content was similar to wild-type plants. Our results suggest that the OsAld-Y participates in Chl accumulation, chloroplast development and plant growth by influencing the photosynthetic rate of leaves and the sugar metabolism of rice.
27303811	Overexpression of OsSAP16 Regulates Photosynthesis and the Expression of a Broad Range of Stress Response Genes in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	This study set out to identify and characterize transcription factors regulating photosynthesis in rice. Screening populations of rice T-DNA activation lines led to the identification of a T-DNA mutant with an increase in intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) under well-watered conditions. Flanking sequence analysis showed that the T-DNA construct was located upstream of LOC_Os07g38240 (OsSAP16) encoding for a stress-associated protein (SAP). A second mutant identified with activation in the same gene exhibited the same phenotype; expression of OsSAP16 was shown to be enhanced in both lines. There were no differences in stomatal development or morphology in either of these mutants, although overexpression of OsSAP16 reduced stomatal conductance. This phenotype limited CO2 uptake and the rate of photosynthesis, which resulted in the accumulation of less biomass in the two mutants. Whole transcriptome analysis showed that overexpression of OsSAP16 led to global changes in gene expression consistent with the function of zinc-finger transcription factors. These results show that the gene is involved in modulating the response of rice to drought stress through regulation of the expression of a set of stress-associated genes.
27457985	Constitutive over-expression of rice ClpD1 protein enhances tolerance to salt and desiccation stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	2016	Plant Sci	Caseinolytic proteases (Clps) perform the important role of removing protein aggregates from cells, which can otherwise prove to be highly toxic. ClpD system is a two-component protease complex composed of a regulatory ATPase module ClpD and a proteolytic component ClpP. Under desiccation stress condition, rice ClpD1 (OsClpD1) gene encoding for the regulatory subunit, was represented by four variant transcripts differing mainly in the expanse of their N-terminal amino acids. These transcripts were expressed in a differential manner in response to salt, mannitol and polyethylene glycol stresses in rice. Purified OsClpD1.3 protein exhibited intrinsic chaperone activity, shown using citrate synthase as substrate. Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants over-expressing OsClpD1.3 open reading frame downstream to CaMV35S promoter (ClpD1.3 plants) showed higher tolerance to salt and desiccation stresses as compared to wild type plants. ClpD1.3 seedlings also showed enhanced growth during the early stages of seed germination under unstressed, control conditions. The free proline levels and starch breakdown activities were higher in the ClpD1.3 seedlings as compared to the wild type Arabidopsis seedlings. It thus emerges that increasing the potential of ClpD1 chaperoning activity may be of advantage in protection against abiotic stresses.
27251327	Overexpression of a Chimeric Gene, OsDST-SRDX, Improved Salt Tolerance of Perennial Ryegrass.	2016	Sci Rep	The Drought and Salt Tolerance gene (DST) encodes a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, which negatively regulates salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). Phylogenetic analysis of six homologues of DST genes in different plant species revealed that DST genes were conserved evolutionarily. Here, the rice DST gene was linked to an SRDX domain for gene expression repression based on the Chimeric REpressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) to make a chimeric gene (OsDST-SRDX) construct and introduced into perennial ryegrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Integration and expression of the OsDST-SRDX in transgenic plants were tested by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. Transgenic lines overexpressing the OsDST-SRDX fusion gene showed obvious phenotypic differences and clear resistance to salt-shock and to continuous salt stresses compared to non-transgenic plants. Physiological analyses including relative leaf water content, electrolyte leakage, proline content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, H2O2 content and sodium and potassium accumulation indicated that the OsDST-SRDX fusion gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic perennial ryegrass by altering a wide range of physiological responses. To our best knowledge this study is the first report of utilizing Chimeric Repressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) in turfgrass and forage species for salt-tolerance improvement.
27342307	A NAP-Family Histone Chaperone Functions in Abiotic Stress Response and Adaptation.	2016	Plant Physiol	Modulation of gene expression is one of the most significant molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress response in plants. Via altering DNA accessibility, histone chaperones affect the transcriptional competence of genomic loci. However, in contrast to other factors affecting chromatin dynamics, the role of plant histone chaperones in abiotic stress response and adaptation remains elusive. Here, we studied the physiological function of a stress-responsive putative rice (Oryza sativa) histone chaperone of the NAP superfamily: OsNAPL6. We show that OsNAPL6 is a nuclear-localized H3/H4 histone chaperone capable of assembling a nucleosome-like structure. Utilizing overexpression and knockdown approaches, we found a positive correlation between OsNAPL6 expression levels and adaptation to multiple abiotic stresses. Results of comparative transcriptome profiling and promoter-recruitment studies indicate that OsNAPL6 functions during stress response via modulation of expression of various genes involved in diverse functions. For instance, we show that OsNAPL6 is recruited to OsRad51 promoter, activating its expression and leading to more efficient DNA repair and abrogation of programmed cell death under salinity and genotoxic stress conditions. These results suggest that the histone chaperone OsNAPL6 may serve a regulatory role in abiotic stress physiology possibly via modulating nucleosome dynamics at various stress-associated genomic loci. Taken together, our findings establish a hitherto unknown link between histone chaperones and abiotic stress response in plants.
27313586	Overexpression of Rice Glutaredoxin OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 Reduces Intracellular Arsenic Accumulation and Increases Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are a family of small multifunctional proteins involved in various cellular functions, including redox regulation and protection under oxidative stress. Despite the high number of Grx genes in plant genomes (48 Grxs in rice), the biological functions and physiological roles of most of them remain unknown. Here, the functional characterization of the two arsenic-responsive rice Grx family proteins, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 are reported. Over-expression of OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana conferred arsenic (As) tolerance as reflected by germination, root growth assay, and whole plant growth. Also, the transgenic expression of OsGrxs displayed significantly reduced As accumulation in A. thaliana seeds and shoot tissues compared to WT plants during both AsIII and AsV stress. Thus, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 seem to be an important determinant of As-stress response in plants. OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 transgenic showed to maintain intracellular GSH pool and involved in lowering AsIII accumulation either by extrusion or reducing uptake by altering the transcript of A. thaliana AtNIPs. Overall, OsGrx_C7 and OsGrx_C2.1 may represent a Grx family protein involved in As stress response and may allow a better understanding of the As induced stress pathways and the design of strategies for the improvement of stress tolerance as well as decreased As content in crops.
27446153	MATH-Domain Family Shows Response toward Abiotic Stress in Arabidopsis and Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Response to stress represents a highly complex mechanism in plants involving a plethora of genes and gene families. It has been established that plants use some common set of genes and gene families for both biotic and abiotic stress responses leading to cross-talk phenomena. One such family, Meprin And TRAF Homology (MATH) domain containing protein (MDCP), has been known to be involved in biotic stress response. In this study, we present genome-wide identification of various members of MDCP family from both Arabidopsis and rice. A large number of members identified in Arabidopsis and rice indicate toward an expansion and diversification of MDCP family in both the species. Chromosomal localization of MDCP genes in Arabidopsis and rice reveals their presence in a few specific clusters on various chromosomes such as, chromosome III in Arabidopsis and chromosome X in rice. For the functional analysis of MDCP genes, we used information from publicly available data for plant growth and development as well as biotic stresses and found differential expression of various members of the family. Further, we narrowed down 11 potential candidate genes in rice which showed high expression in various tissues and development stages as well as biotic stress conditions. The expression analysis of these 11 genes in rice using qRT-PCR under drought and salinity stress identified OsM4 and OsMB11 to be highly expressed in both the stress conditions. Taken together, our data indicates that OsM4 and OsMB11 can be used as potential candidates for generating stress resilient crops.
27337377	Investigating inducible short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases clarifies rice oryzalexin biosynthesis.	2016	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces a variety of labdane-related diterpenoids as phytoalexins and allelochemicals. The production of these important natural products has been partially elucidated. However, the oxidases responsible for production of the keto groups found in many of these diterpenoids have largely remained unknown. Only one short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs), which has been proposed to catalyze the last step in such a pathway, has been characterized to date. While rice contains >220 SDRs, only the transcription of five has been shown to be induced by the fungal cell wall elicitor chitin. This includes the momilactone A synthase (OsMAS/SDR110C-MS1), with the other four all falling in the same SDR110C family, further suggesting roles in diterpenoid biosynthesis. Here, biochemical characterization with simplified substrate analogs was first used to indicate potential functions, which were then supported by further analyses with key biosynthetic intermediates. Kinetic studies were then employed to further clarify these roles. Surprisingly, OsSDR110C-MS2 more efficiently catalyzes the final oxidation to produce momilactone A that was previously assigned to OsMAS/SDR110C-MS1, and we speculate that this latter SDR may have an alternative function instead. Conversely, two of these SDRs clearly appear to act in oryzalexin biosynthesis, with OsSDR110C-MI3 readily oxidizing the 3α-hydroxyl of oryzalexin D, while OsSDR110C-MS3 can also oxidize the accompanying 7β-hydroxyl. Together, these SDRs then serve to produce oryzalexins A-C from oryzalexin D, essentially completing elucidation of the biosynthesis of this family of rice phytoalexins.
27451952	Structure of a plant β-galactosidase C-terminal domain.	2016	Biochim Biophys Acta	Most plant β-galactosidases, which belong to glycoside hydrolase family 35, have a C-terminal domain homologous to animal galactose and rhamnose-binding lectins. To investigate the structure and function of this domain, the C-terminal domain of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) β-galactosidase 1 (OsBGal1 Cter) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The free OsBGal1 Cter is monomeric with a native molecular weight of 15kDa. NMR spectroscopy indicated that OsBGal1 Cter comprises five β-strands and one α-helix. The structure of this domain is similar to lectin domains from animals, but loops A and C of OsBGal1 Cter are longer than the corresponding loops from related animal lectins with known structures. In addition, loop A of OsBGal1 Cter was not well defined, suggesting it is flexible. Although OsBGal1 Cter was predicted to be a galactose/rhamnose-binding domain, binding with rhamnose, galactose, glucose, β-1,4-d-galactobiose and raffinose could not be observed in NMR experiments.
27444058	Deregulation of the OsmiR160 Target Gene OsARF18 Causes Growth and Developmental Defects with an Alteration of Auxin Signaling in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression as key negative regulators at the post-transcriptional level. MiR160 plays a pivotal role in Arabidopsis growth and development through repressing expression of its target AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) genes; however, the function of miR160 in monocots remains elusive. In this study, we found that the mature rice miR160 (OsmiR160) was mainly derived from OsMIR160a and OsMIR160b genes. Among four potential OsmiR160 target OsARF genes, the OsARF18 transcript was cleaved at the OsmiR160 target site. Rice transgenic plants (named mOsARF18) expressing an OsmiR160-resistant version of OsARF18 exhibited pleiotropic defects in growth and development, including dwarf stature, rolled leaves, and small seeds. mOsARF18 leaves were abnormal in bulliform cell differentiation and epidermal cell division. Starch accumulation in mOsARF18 seeds was also reduced. Moreover, auxin induced expression of OsMIR160a, OsMIR160b, and OsARF18, whereas expression of OsMIR160a and OsMIR160b as well as genes involved in auxin signaling was altered in mOsARF18 plants. Our results show that negative regulation of OsARF18 expression by OsmiR160 is critical for rice growth and development via affecting auxin signaling, which will advance future studies on the molecular mechanism by which miR160 fine-tunes auxin signaling in plants.
27367609	A High Temperature-Dependent Mitochondrial Lipase EXTRA GLUME1 Promotes Floral Phenotypic Robustness against Temperature Fluctuation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS Genet	The sessile plants have evolved diverse intrinsic mechanisms to control their proper development under variable environments. In contrast to plastic vegetative development, reproductive traits like floral identity often show phenotypic robustness against environmental variations. However, it remains obscure about the molecular basis of this phenotypic robustness. In this study, we found that eg1 (extra glume1) mutants of rice (Oryza savita L.) showed floral phenotypic variations in different growth locations resulting in a breakdown of floral identity robustness. Physiological and biochemical analyses showed that EG1 encodes a predominantly mitochondria-localized functional lipase and functions in a high temperature-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that numerous environmentally responsive genes including many floral identity genes are transcriptionally repressed in eg1 mutants and OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsG1 genetically act downstream of EG1 to maintain floral robustness. Collectively, our results demonstrate that EG1 promotes floral robustness against temperature fluctuation by safeguarding the expression of floral identify genes through a high temperature-dependent mitochondrial lipid pathway and uncovers a novel mechanistic insight into floral developmental control.
27420922	OsASR5 enhances drought tolerance through a stomatal closure pathway associated with ABA and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> signalling in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses that directly implicate plant growth and crop productivity. Although many genes in response to drought stress have been identified, genetic improvement to drought resistance especially in food crops is showing relatively slow progress worldwide. Here, we reported the isolation of abscisic acid, stress and ripening (ASR) genes from upland rice variety, IRAT109 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica), and demonstrated that overexpression of OsASR5 enhanced osmotic tolerance in Escherichia coli and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis and rice by regulating leaf water status under drought stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression of OsASR5 in rice increased endogenous ABA level and showed hypersensitive to exogenous ABA treatment at both germination and postgermination stages. The production of H2 O2 , a second messenger for the induction of stomatal closure in response to ABA, was activated in overexpression plants under drought stress conditions, consequently, increased stomatal closure and decreased stomatal conductance. In contrast, the loss-of-function mutant, osasr5, showed sensitivity to drought stress with lower relative water content under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that OsASR5 functioned as chaperone-like protein and interacted with stress-related HSP40 and 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase domain containing proteins in yeast and plants. Taken together, we suggest that OsASR5 plays multiple roles in response to drought stress by regulating ABA biosynthesis, promoting stomatal closure, as well as acting as chaperone-like protein that possibly prevents drought stress-related proteins from inactivation.
27392090	Potential Application of the Oryza sativa Monodehydroascorbate Reductase Gene (OsMDHAR) to Improve the Stress Tolerance and Fermentative Capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2016	PLoS One	Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is an important enzyme for ascorbate recycling. To examine whether heterologous expression of MDHAR from Oryza sativa (OsMDHAR) can prevent the deleterious effects of unfavorable growth conditions, we constructed a transgenic yeast strain harboring a recombinant plasmid carrying OsMDHAR (p426GPD::OsMDHAR). OsMDHAR-expressing yeast cells displayed enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide by maintaining redox homoeostasis, proteostasis, and the ascorbate (AsA)-like pool following the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes and molecules, metabolic enzymes, and molecular chaperones and their cofactors, compared to wild-type (WT) cells carrying vector alone. The addition of exogenous AsA or its analogue isoascorbic acid increased the viability of WT and ara2Δ cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the survival of OsMDHAR-expressing cells was greater than that of WT cells when cells at mid-log growth phase were exposed to high concentrations of ethanol. High OsMDHAR expression also improved the fermentative capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a standard cultivation temperature (30°C). The alcohol yield of OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast during fermentation was approximately 25% (0.18 g·g-1) higher than that of WT yeast. Accordingly, OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation. These results suggest that heterologous OsMDHAR expression increases tolerance to reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves survival during fermentation, which enhances fermentative capacity.
27462334	G1/ELE Functions in the Development of Rice Lemmas in Addition to Determining Identities of Empty Glumes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice empty glumes, also named sterile lemmas or rudimentary lemmas according to different interpretations, are distinct from lemmas in morphology and cellular pattern. Consistently, the molecular mechanism to control the development of lemmas is different from that of empty glumes. Rice LEAFY HULL STERILE1(OsLHS1) and DROOPING LEAF(DL) regulate the cellular pattern and the number of vascular bundles of lemmas respectively, while LONG STERILE LEMMA1 (G1)/ELONGATED EMPTY GLUME (ELE) and PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2)/OsMADS34 determine identities of empty glumes. Though some progress has been made, identities of empty glumes remain unclear, and genetic interactions between lemma genes and glume genes have been rarely elucidated. In this research, a new G1/ELE mutant g1-6 was identified and the phenotype was analyzed. Similar to previously reported mutant lines of G1/ELE, empty glumes of g1-6 plants transform into lemma-like organs. Furthermore, Phenotypes of single and double mutant plants suggest that, in addition to their previously described gene-specific functions, G1/ELE and OsLHS1 play redundant roles in controlling vascular bundle number, cell volume, and cell layer number of empty glumes and lemmas. Meanwhile, expression patterns of G1/ELE in osmads1-z flowers and OsLHS1 in g1-6 flowers indicate they do not regulate each other at the level of transcription. Finally, down-regulation of the empty glume gene OsMADS34/PAP2 and ectopic expression of the lemma gene DL, in the g1-6 plants provide further evidence that empty glumes are sterile lemmas. Generally, our findings provided valuable information for better understanding functions of G1 and OsLHS1 in flower development and identities of empty glumes.
27457124	Genome-Wide Targets Regulated by the OsMADS1 Transcription Factor Reveals Its DNA Recognition Properties.	2016	Plant Physiol	OsMADS1 controls rice (Oryza sativa) floral fate and organ development. Yet, its genome-wide targets and the mechanisms underlying its role as a transcription regulator controlling developmental gene expression are unknown. We identify 3112 gene-associated OsMADS1-bound sites in the floret genome. These occur in the vicinity of transcription start sites, within gene bodies, and in intergenic regions. Majority of the bound DNA contained CArG motif variants or, in several cases, only A-tracts. Sequences flanking the binding peak had a higher AT nucleotide content, implying that broader DNA structural features may define in planta binding. Sequences for binding by other transcription factor families like MYC, AP2/ERF, bZIP, etc. are enriched in OsMADS1-bound DNAs. Target genes implicated in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cellular processes, and hormone metabolism were enriched. Combining expression data from OsMADS1 knockdown florets with these DNA binding data, a snapshot of a gene regulatory network was deduced where targets, such as AP2/ERF and bHLH transcription factors and chromatin remodelers form nodes. We show that the expression status of these nodal factors can be altered by inducing the OsMADS1-GR fusion protein and present a model for a regulatory cascade where the direct targets of OsMADS1, OsbHLH108/SPT, OsERF034, and OsHSF24, in turn control genes such as OsMADS32 and OsYABBY5 This cascade, with other similar relationships, cumulatively contributes to floral organ development. Overall, OsMADS1 binds to several regulatory genes and, probably in combination with other factors, controls a gene regulatory network that ensures rice floret development.

27434775	Silicon ameliorates chromium toxicity through phytochelatin-mediated vacuolar sequestration in the roots of Oryza sativa (L.).	2017	Int J Phytoremediation	High chromium (Cr) in rice causes reduced yield and health hazards. This work investigates how Si alleviates Cr toxicity in rice. Addition of Si under Cr stress restored the growth parameters, total protein content, and membrane stability along with reduced Cr content in shoots, confirming that Si plays critical roles in Cr detoxification in rice. However, Si supplementation under Cr stress caused no significant changes in root Cr content but decreased shoot Cr concentrations compared with Cr-stressed plants, indicating that alleviation of Cr toxicity might be associated with Cr sequestration in roots. Further, concentration of Fe and expression of Fe transporter (OsIRT1) showed no significant changes due to Si supplementation under Cr stress, implying that Fe regulation is not involved with Si-mediated mitigation of Cr toxicity in rice. Further, phytochelatin accumulation and OsPCS1 (phytochelatin synthase) transcripts strongly induced due to the dual treatment of Si and Cr compared with Cr-stressed plants, suggesting that phytochelatin might bind to Cr, which leads to vacuolar sequestration in roots. Furthermore, increased glutathione reductase activity in roots implies that active involvement of ROS scavenging partially ameliorates Cr toxicity in rice plants. The study illustrates first evidences on the effect of Si alleviating Cr toxicity in rice plants.
27194802	Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	OsWUS has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice. The OsWUS protein consists of three conserved structural domains, but their biological functions are still unclear. We discovered a new rice mutant resulting from tissue culture, which hardly produced tillers and exhibited complete female sterility. The male and female floral organs of the mutant were morphologically indistinguishable from those of the wild type. We named the mutant srt1 for completely sterile and reduced tillering 1. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in OsWUS Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of OsWUS (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of OsWUS, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of OsWUS. However, the mutant phenotypes (monoculm and female sterility) displayed in srt1 were as typical and severe as those in tab1-1 and moc3-1 This indicates that the homeobox domain of SRT1 is essential for the regulation of tillering and sterility in rice. In addition, srt1 showed an opposite effect on panicle development to that of the two null allelic mutants, implying that the srt1 protein might still have partial or even new functions on panicle development. The results of this study suggest that the homeobox domain is pivotal for OsWUS function.
27447607	The OsCYP19-4 Gene Is Expressed as Multiple Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Encoding Isoforms with Distinct Cellular Localizations and PPIase Activities under Cold Stress.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Alternative splicing (AS) is an important molecular mechanism by which single genes can generate multiple mRNA isoforms. We reported previously that, in Oryza sativa, the cyclophilin 19-4 (OsCYP19-4.1) transcript was significantly upregulated in response to cold stress, and that transgenic plants were cold tolerant. Here we show that, under cold stress, OsCYP19-4 produces eight transcript variants by intron retention and exon skipping, resulting in production of four distinct protein isoforms. The OsCYP19-4 AS isoforms exhibited different cellular localizations in the epidermal cells: in contrast to OsCYP19-4.1, the OsCYP19-4.2 and OsCYP19-4.3 proteins were primarily targeted to guard and subsidiary cells, whereas OsCYP19-4.5, which consists largely of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting signal, was co-localized with the RFP-BiP marker in the ER. In OsCYP19-4.2, the key residues of the PPIase domain are altered; consistent with this, recombinant OsCYP19-4.2 had significantly lower PPIase activity than OsCYP19-4.1 in vitro. Specific protein-protein interactions between OsCYP19-4.2/3 and AtRCN1 were verified in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluoresence complementation (BiFC assays), although the OsCYP19-4 isoforms could not bind each other. Based on these results, we propose that two OsCYP19-4 AS isoforms, OsCYP19-4.2 and OsCYP19-4.3, play roles linking auxin transport and cold stress via interactions with RCN1.
27473592	Stress-responsive gene RsICE1 from Raphanus sativus increases cold tolerance in rice.	2017	Protoplasma	The ICE1 transcription factor plays a critical role in plant cold tolerance via triggering CBF/DREB1 cold-regulated signal networks. In this work, a novel MYC-type ICE1-like gene, RsICE1, was isolated from radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and its function in cold tolerance was characterized in rice. The RsICE1 gene was expressed constitutively with higher transcriptional levels in the roots and stems of radish seedlings. The NaCl, cold, and ABA treatments could significantly upregulate RsICE1 expression levels, but dehydration stress had a weak effect on its expression. Ectopic expression of the RsICE1 gene in rice conferred enhanced tolerance to low-temperature stress grounded on a higher survival rate, higher accumulation of soluble sugars and free proline content, a decline in electrolyte leakage and MDA levels, and higher chlorophyll levels relative to control plants. OsDREBL and OsTPP1, downstream cold-regulated genes, were remarkably upregulated at transcription levels in rice overexpressing RsICE1 under low-temperature stress, which indicated that RsICE1 was involved in CBF/DREB1 cold-regulated signal networks. Overall, the above data showed that RsICE1 played an active role in improving rice cold tolerance, most likely resulting from the upregulation of OsDREBL and OsTPP1 expression levels by interacting with the RsICE1 gene under low-temperature stress.

27380315	Mutation of Rice Early Flowering3.1 (OsELF3.1) delays leaf senescence in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	In Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) has pivotal roles in controlling circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering. In addition, ELF3 negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing the transcription of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5); elf3 mutants senesce earlier and ELF3-overexpressing (ELF3-OX) plants senesce later than wild type (WT). Here, we show that in contrast to Arabidopsis ELF3, which represses senescence, the rice homolog OsELF3.1 promotes leaf senescence; oself3.1 mutants showed delayed senescence and OsELF3.1-OX plants senesced earlier under both dark-induced and natural senescence conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that in the senescing leaves, a number of senescence-associated genes, phytohormone-related genes, and NAC and WRKY family genes (OsNAP, ONAC106, and OsWRKY42) were differentially expressed in oself3.1 mutants compared with WT. Interestingly, we found that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsELF3.1 show delayed leaf senescence, produce short petioles, and flower late in long days, just like Arabidopsis ELF3-OX plants. This demonstrates that the regulatory functions of ELF3 and OsELF3.1 are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice, but the downstream regulatory cascades have opposite effects.
27467198	Rice root curling, a response to mechanosensing, is modulated by the rice E3-ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (OsHOS1).	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Plant development depends on the perception of external cues, such as light, gravity, touch, wind or nutrients, among others. Nevertheless, little is known regarding signal transduction pathways integrating these stimuli. Recently, we have reported the involvement of a rice E3-ubiquitin ligase (OsHOS1, HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1), previously associated with abiotic stress response, in root responses to mechanical stimuli. We showed that OsHOS1 is involved in the regulation of root curling after mechanosensing and that RNAi::OsHOS1 plants failed to exhibit the root curling phenotype observed in WT. Interestingly, the straight root phenotype of these transgenics correlated with the up-regulation of rice ROOT MEANDER CURLING (OsRMC, a negative regulator of rice root curling) and was reverted by the exogenous application of jasmonic acid. Altogether, our results highlight the role of the proteasome modulating plant responses to mechanical stimuli and suggest that OsHOS1 is a hub integrating environmental and hormonal signaling into plant growth and development.
27477683	Control of Leaf Senescence by an MeOH-Jasmonates Cascade that Is Epigenetically Regulated by OsSRT1 in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the genes regulating accumulation of hormones that are involved in leaf senescence, only a few studies have focused on natural variations in jasmonates content and much less on the underlying genetic basis. Moreover, the epigenetic regulation of jasmonate-mediated leaf senescence remains largely unknown. In this study, we carried out metabolic profiling of a worldwide collection of rice accessions and demonstrated that there are substantial variations in jasmonate levels among these accessions. A subsequent metabolite-based genome-wide association study identified candidates for two major quantitative genes (QTGs), OsPME1 and OsTSD2, affecting the content of jasmonates. Further investigations using a series of relevant mutants and transgenic lines revealed the MeOH-jasmonate cascade plays an important role in regulating leaf senescence. Moreover, we showed that OsSRT1, one of the two Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) homologs in rice, negatively regulates leaf senescence by repressing expression of the biosynthetic genes of this metabolic cascade and at least particially through histone H3K9 deacetylation of OsPME1. Taken together, our results indicate that the MeOH-jasmonates cascade and its epigenetic regulation are crucial for controlling leaf senescence process in rice.
27424498	OsREM4.1 Interacts with OsSERK1 to Coordinate the Interlinking between Abscisic Acid and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.	2016	Dev Cell	Crosstalk among phytohormones is crucial for balancing plant growth and adjustment to various environments. Abscisic acid (ABA) and brassinosteroids (BRs) exhibit antagonistic interactions during many plant development processes, but little is known about the molecular mechanism mediating those interactions. Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) remorin gene, OsREM4.1, whose expression is upregulated by ABA through the transcriptional activator OsbZIP23. OsREM4.1, in return, negatively regulates BR signaling output. We discovered that OsREM4.1 interacts with OsSERK1 to inhibit its interaction with rice BR receptor OsBRI1. Moreover, OsBRI1 could phosphorylate OsREM4.1 to reduce the binding affinity of OsREM4.1 to OsSERK1. These results demonstrate that OsREM4.1 is transcriptionally regulated by ABA and functions as an OsBRI1 substrate and OsSERK1-interacting protein to inhibit the formation and subsequent activation of the OsBRI1-OsSERK1 receptor complex. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which the antagonistic interactions between ABA and BRs are coordinated in rice.
27462908	Linear Energy Transfer-Dependent Change in Rice Gene Expression Profile after Heavy-Ion Beam Irradiation.	2016	PLoS One	A heavy-ion beam has been recognized as an effective mutagen for plant breeding and applied to the many kinds of crops including rice. In contrast with X-ray or γ-ray, the heavy-ion beam is characterized by a high linear energy transfer (LET). LET is an important factor affecting several aspects of the irradiation effect, e.g. cell survival and mutation frequency, making the heavy-ion beam an effective mutagen. To study the mechanisms behind LET-dependent effects, expression profiling was performed after heavy-ion beam irradiation of imbibed rice seeds. Array-based experiments at three time points (0.5, 1, 2 h after the irradiation) revealed that the number of up- or down-regulated genes was highest 2 h after irradiation. Array-based experiments with four different LETs at 2 h after irradiation identified LET-independent regulated genes that were up/down-regulated regardless of the value of LET; LET-dependent regulated genes, whose expression level increased with the rise of LET value, were also identified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of LET-independent up-regulated genes showed that some GO terms were commonly enriched, both 2 hours and 3 weeks after irradiation. GO terms enriched in LET-dependent regulated genes implied that some factor regulates genes that have kinase activity or DNA-binding activity in cooperation with the ATM gene. Of the LET-dependent up-regulated genes, OsPARP3 and OsPCNA were identified, which are involved in DNA repair pathways. This indicates that the Ku-independent alternative non-homologous end-joining pathway may contribute to repairing complex DNA legions induced by high-LET irradiation. These findings may clarify various LET-dependent responses in rice.
27411391	OsPAP10c, a novel secreted acid phosphatase in rice, plays an important role in the utilization of external organic phosphorus.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Under phosphate (Pi ) starvation, plants increase the secretion of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) into the rhizosphere to scavenge organic phosphorus (P) for plant use. To date, only a few members of the PAP family have been characterized in crops. In this study, we identified a novel secreted PAP in rice, OsPAP10c, and investigated its role in the utilization of external organic P. OsPAP10c belongs to a monocotyledon-specific subclass of Ia group PAPs and is specifically expressed in the epidermis/exodermis cell layers of roots. Both the transcript and protein levels of OsPAP10c are strongly induced by Pi starvation. OsPAP10c overexpression increased acid phosphatase (APase) activity by more than 10-fold in the culture media and almost fivefold in both roots and leaves under Pi -sufficient and Pi -deficient conditions. This increase in APase activity further improved the plant utilization efficiency of external organic P. Moreover, several APase isoforms corresponding to OsPAP10c were identified using in-gel activity assays. Under field conditions with three different Pi supply levels, OsPAP10c-overexpressing plants had significantly higher tiller numbers and shorter plant heights. This study indicates that OsPAP10c encodes a novel secreted APase that plays an important role in the utilization of external organic P in rice.
27405463	A CONSTANS-like transcriptional activator, OsCOL13, functions as a negative regulator of flowering downstream of OsphyB and upstream of Ehd1 in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Flowering time determines the adaptability of crop plants to different local environments, thus being one of the most important agronomic traits targeted in breeding programs. Photoperiod is one of the key factors that control flowering in plant. A number of genes that participate in the photoperiod pathway have been characterized in long-day plants such as Arabidopsis, as well as in short-day plants such as Oryza sativa. Of those, CONSTANS (CO) as a floral integrator promotes flowering in Arabidopsis under long day conditions. In rice, Heading date1 (Hd1), a homologue of CO, functions in an opposite way, which inhibits flowering under long day conditions and induces flowering under short day conditions. Here, we show that another CONSTANS-like (COL) gene, OsCOL13, negatively regulates flowering in rice under both long and short day conditions. Overexpression of OsCOL13 delays flowering regardless of day length. We also demonstrated that OsCOL13 has a constitutive and rhythmic expression pattern, and that OsCOL13 is localized to the nucleus. OsCOL13 displays transcriptional activation activity in the yeast assays and likely forms homodimers in vivo. OsCOL13 suppresses the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 by repressing Ehd1, but has no relationship with other known Ehd1 regulators as determined by using mutants or near isogenic lines. In addition, the transcriptional level of OsCOL13 significantly decreased in the osphyb mutant, but remained unchanged in the osphya and osphyc mutants. Thus, we conclude that OsCOL13 functions as a negative regulator downstream of OsphyB and upstream of Ehd1 in the photoperiodic flowering in rice.
27486471	Rice Stress Associated Protein 1 (OsSAP1) Interacts with Aminotransferase (OsAMTR1) and Pathogenesis-Related 1a Protein (OsSCP) and Regulates Abiotic Stress Responses.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Stress associated proteins (SAPs) are the A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing proteins which can regulate the stress signaling in plants. The rice SAP protein, OsSAP1 has been shown to confer abiotic stress tolerance to plants, when overexpressed, by modulating the expression of endogenous stress-related genes. To further understand the mechanism of OsSAP1-mediated stress signaling, OsSAP1 interacting proteins were identified using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Two novel proteins, aminotransferase (OsAMTR1) and a SCP/TAPS or pathogenesis-related 1 class of protein (OsSCP) were found to interact with OsSAP1. The genes encoding OsAMTR1 and OsSCP were stress-responsive and showed higher expression upon abiotic stress treatments. The role of OsAMTR1 and OsSCP under stress was analyzed by overexpressing them constitutively in Arabidopsis and responses of transgenic plants were assessed under salt and water-deficit stress. The OsAMTR1 and OsSCP overexpressing plants showed higher seed germination, root growth and fresh weight than wild-type plants under stress conditions. Overexpression of OsAMTR1 and OsSCP affected the expression of many known stress-responsive genes which were not affected by the overexpression of OsSAP1. Moreover, the transcript levels of OsSCP and OsAMTR1 were also unaffected by the overexpression of OsSAP1. Hence, it was concluded that OsSAP1 regulates the stress responsive signaling by interacting with these proteins which further regulate the downstream stress responsive gene expression.
27382137	Overexpression of the OsERF71 Transcription Factor Alters Rice Root Structure and Drought Resistance.	2016	Plant Physiol	Plant responses to drought stress require the regulation of transcriptional networks via drought-responsive transcription factors, which mediate a range of morphological and physiological changes. AP2/ERF transcription factors are known to act as key regulators of drought resistance transcriptional networks; however, little is known about the associated molecular mechanisms that give rise to specific morphological and physiological adaptations. In this study, we functionally characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) drought-responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor OsERF71, which is expressed predominantly in the root meristem, pericycle, and endodermis. Overexpression of OsERF71, either throughout the entire plant or specifically in roots, resulted in a drought resistance phenotype at the vegetative growth stage, indicating that overexpression in roots was sufficient to confer drought resistance. The root-specific overexpression was more effective in conferring drought resistance at the reproductive stage, such that grain yield was increased by 23% to 42% over wild-type plants or whole-body overexpressing transgenic lines under drought conditions. OsERF71 overexpression in roots elevated the expression levels of genes related to cell wall loosening and lignin biosynthetic genes, which correlated with changes in root structure, the formation of enlarged aerenchyma, and high lignification levels. Furthermore, OsERF71 was found to directly bind to the promoter of OsCINNAMOYL-COENZYME A REDUCTASE1, a key gene in lignin biosynthesis. These results indicate that the OsERF71-mediated drought resistance pathway recruits factors involved in cell wall modification to enable root morphological adaptations, thereby providing a mechanism for enhancing drought resistance.
27412910	Variation of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa) exposed to cadmium.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	We report genome-wide single-base resolution maps of methylated cytosines and transcriptome change in Cd-exposed rice. Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG methylation marks between Cd-exposed and Cd-free rice genomes. There are 2320 non-redundant differentially methylated regions detected in the genome. RNA sequencing revealed 2092 DNA methylation-modified genes differentially expressed under Cd exposure. More genes were found hypermethylated than those hypomethylated in CG, CHH and CHG (where H is A, C or T) contexts in upstream, gene body and downstream regions. Many of the genes were involved in stress response, metal transport and transcription factors. Most of the DNA methylation-modified genes were transcriptionally altered under Cd stress. A subset of loss of function mutants defective in DNA methylation and histone modification activities was used to identify transcript abundance of selected genes. Compared with wide type, mutation of MET1 and DRM2 resulted in general lower transcript levels of the genes under Cd stress. Transcripts of OsIRO2, OsPR1b and Os09g02214 in drm2 were significantly reduced. A commonly used DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine was employed to investigate whether DNA demethylation affected physiological consequences. 5-azacytidine provision decreased general DNA methylation levels of selected genes, but promoted growth of rice seedlings and Cd accumulation in rice plant.
27378815	The Systemic Acquired Resistance Regulator OsNPR1 Attenuates Growth by Repressing Auxin Signaling through Promoting IAA-Amido Synthase Expression.	2016	Plant Physiol	Systemic acquired resistance is a long-lasting and broad-spectrum disease resistance to pathogens. Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (OsNPR1), a master gene for systemic acquired resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), greatly enhanced resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae However, the growth and development of the OsNPR1 overexpression (OsNPR1-OX) plants were restrained, and the mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we dissected the OsNPR1-induced growth inhibition. We found that the OsNPR1-OX lines displayed phenotypes mimicking auxin-defective mutants, with decreases in root system, seed number and weight, internode elongation, and tiller number. Whole-genome expression analysis revealed that genes related to the auxin metabolism and signaling pathway were differentially expressed between the OsNPR1-OX and wild-type plants. Consistently, the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content was decreased and the auxin distribution pattern was altered in OsNPR1-OX plants. Importantly, we found that some GH3 family members, in particular OsGH3.8 coding IAA-amido synthetase, were constitutively up-regulated in OsNPR1-OX plants. Decreased OsGH3.8 expression by RNA interference could partially restore IAA level and largely rescue the restrained growth and development phenotypes but did not affect the disease resistance of OsNPR1-OX plants. Taken together, we revealed that OsNPR1 affects rice growth and development by disrupting the auxin pathway at least partially through indirectly up-regulating OsGH3.8 expression.

27531886	Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase, affects chloroplast development at low temperatures.	2016	J Exp Bot	Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we characterized the temperature-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant tcd5, which develops albino leaves at low temperatures (20 °C) and normal green leaves at high temperatures (32 °C). The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 °C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development. The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 °C. We performed positional cloning of TCD5 and then complementation and knock-down experiments, and the results showed that the transcript LOC_Os05g34040.1 from the LOC_Os05g34040 gene corresponded to the tcd5 phenotype. TCD5 encodes a conserved plastid-targeted monooxygenase family protein which has not been previously reported associated with a temperature-sensitive albino phenotype in plants. TCD5 is abundantly expressed in young leaves and immature spikes, and low temperatures increased this expression. The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant. Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots.
27524243	Overexpression of OsEm1 encoding a group I LEA protein confers enhanced drought tolerance in rice.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Drought is the greatest threat for crops, including rice. In an effort to identify rice genes responsible for drought tolerance, a drought-responsive gene OsEm1 encoding a group I LEA protein, was chosen for this study. OsEm1 was shown at vegetative stages to be responsive to various abiotic stresses, including drought, salt, cold and the hormone ABA. In this study, we generated OsEm1-overexpressing rice plants to explore the function of OsEm1 under drought conditions. Overexpression of OsEm1 increases ABA sensitivity and enhances osmotic tolerance in rice. Compared with wild type, the OsEm1-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced plant survival ratio at the vegetative stage; moreover, over expression of OsEm1 in rice increased the expression of other LEA genes, including RAB16A, RAB16C, RAB21, and LEA3, likely protecting organ integrity against harsh environments. Interestingly, the elevated level of OsEm1 had no different phenotype compared with wild type under normal condition. Our findings suggest that OsEm1 is a positive regulator of drought tolerance and is potentially promising for engineering drought tolerance in rice.
27532299	Involvement of Abscisic Acid in PSII Photodamage and D1 Protein Turnover for Light-Induced Premature Senescence of Rice Flag Leaves.	2016	PLoS One	D1 protein in the PSII reaction center is the major target of photodamage, and it exhibits the highest turnover rate among all the thylakoid proteins. In this paper, rice psf (premature senescence of flag leaves) mutant and its wild type were used to investigate the genotype-dependent alteration in PSII photo-damage and D1 protein turnover during leaf senescence and its relation to ABA accumulation in senescent leaves. The symptom and extent of leaf senescence of the psf mutant appeared to be sunlight-dependent under natural field condition. The psf also displayed significantly higher levels of ABA accumulation in senescent leaves than the wild type. However, the premature senescence lesion of psf leaves could be alleviated by shaded treatment, concomitantly with the strikingly suppressed ABA level in the shaded areas of flag leaves. The change in ABA concentration contributed to the regulation of shade-delayed leaf senescence. The participation of ABA in the timing of senescence initiation and in the subsequent rate of leaf senescence was closely associated with PSII photodamage and D1 protein turnover during leaf senescence, in which the transcriptional expression of several key genes (psbA, psbB, psbC and OsFtsH2) involved in D1 protein biosynthesis and PSII repair cycle was seriously suppressed by the significantly increased ABA level. This response resulted in the low rate of D1 protein synthesis and impaired repair recovery in the presence of ABA. The psf showed evidently decreased D1 protein amount in the senescent leaves. Both the inhibition of de novo synthesized D1 protein and the slow rate of proteolytic removal for the photodamaged D1 protein was among the most crucial steps for the linkage between light-dependent leaf senescence and the varying ABA concentration in psf mutant leaves. OsFtsH2 transcriptional expression possibly played an important role in the regulation of D1 protein turnover and PSII repair cycle in relation to ABA mediated leaf senescence.
27565208	Differential Regulation of Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase Abundances by VIRESCENT 5A (OsV5A) and VIRESCENT 5B (OsV5B) in Rice Seedlings.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	
27574184	MicroRNA393 is involved in nitrogen-promoted rice tillering through regulation of auxin signal transduction in axillary buds.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice tillering has an important influence on grain yield, and is promoted by nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Several genes controlling rice tillering, which are regulated by poor N supply, have been identified. However, the molecular mechanism associated with the regulation of tillering based on N supply is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice microRNA393 (OsmiR393) is involved in N-mediated tillering by decreasing auxin signal sensitivity in axillary buds. Expression analysis showed that N fertilizer causes up-regulation of OsmiR393, but down-regulation of two target genes (OsAFB2 and OsTB1). In situ expression analysis showed that OsmiR393 is highly expressed in the lateral axillary meristem. OsmiR393 overexpression mimicked N-mediated tillering in wild type Zhonghua 11 (ZH11). Mutation of OsMIR393 in ZH11 repressed N-promoted tillering, which simulated the effects of limited N, and this could not be restored by supplying N fertilizer. Western blot analysis showed that OsIAA6 was accumulated in both OsmiR393-overexpressing lines and N-treated wild type rice, but was reduced in the OsMIR393 mutant. Therefore, we deduced that N-induced OsmiR393 accumulation reduces the expression of OsTIR1 and OsAFB2, which alleviates sensitivity to auxin in the axillary buds and stabilizes OsIAA6, thereby promoting rice tillering.
27545590	Overexpression of OsMYB1R1-VP64 fusion protein increases grain yield in rice by delaying flowering time.	2016	FEBS Lett	VP64 is widely used as a transcriptional activator to investigate the biological function of genes, but its potential for application in genetic improvement of crops has not been fully investigated. Here, we characterized an OsMYB1R1-VP64 fusion protein that enhanced the grain yield of rice cultivar 'Kita-ake' by 35%. OsMYB1R1-VP64 regulated grain yield of transgenic plants mainly by extending the vegetative growth stage. Further analysis indicated that OsMYB1R1-VP64 delayed flowering by down-regulating expression of Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUST 1 (RFT1) through repression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1). The expression pattern of OsMYB1R1 was constitutive and rhythmically controlled. OsMYB1R1 protein had transcriptional activation activity and was localized to the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the OsMYB1R1-VP64 construct can be used to increase grain yield in rice.
27499679	Crosstalk of Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Host Defense and Symbiosis Against Microorganisms in Rice.	2016	Curr Genomics	Rice is one of the most important food crops, feeding about half population in the world. Rice pathogens cause enormous damage to rice production worldwide. In plant immunity research, considerable progress has recently been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity. Using genome sequencing and molecular techniques, a number of new MAMPs and their receptors have been identified in the past two decades. Notably, the mechanisms for chitin perception via the lysine motif (LysM) domain-containing receptor OsCERK1, as well as the mechanisms for bacterial MAMP (e.g. flg22, elf18) perception via the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing receptors FLS2 and EFR, have been clarified in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. In chitin signaling in rice, two direct substrates of OsCERK1, Rac/ROP GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsRacGEF1 and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK185, have been identified as components of the OsCERK1 complex and are rapidly phosphorylated by OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Interestingly, OsCERK1 also participates in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in rice and plays a role in the recognition of short-chitin molecules (CO4/5), which are symbiotic signatures included in AMF germinated spore exudates and induced by synthetic strigolactone. Thus, OsCERK1 contributes to both immunity and symbiotic responses. In this review, we describe recent studies on pathways involved in rice immunity and symbiotic signaling triggered by interactions with microorganisms. In addition, we describe recent advances in genetic engineering by using plant immune receptors and symbiotic microorganisms to enhance disease resistance of rice.
27573887	WSL3, a component of the plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase, is essential for early chloroplast development in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP), a dominant RNA polymerase in mature chloroplasts, consists of core subunits and peripheral subunits. Despite the importance of the peripheral subunits in control of PEP activity it is unclear how they interact with one another to exert physiological effects on chloroplast development and plant growth, especially in rice. Here, we report a mutant, designated wsl3 that lacks a peripheral subunit in rice. We isolated the WSL3 gene encoding an essential peripheral subunit of rice PEP complex, OsPAP1/OspTAC3 by map-based cloning, and verified its function by complementation analysis. The wsl3 mutant showed a typical expression pattern of plastid-encoded genes, suggesting that PEP activity was impaired. Using immunofluorescent labeling and immunoblotting, we found that WSL3 was localized to the chloroplast and associated with the nucleoid. In addition, we demonstrated that WSL3 interacted with PEP subunits in Y2H, BiFC and pull-down experiments. Furthermore, a cpDNA IP assay revealed that WSL3 was associated with the PEP complex during the entire transcription process. We provide evidence suggesting that WSL3 is essential for early chloroplast development by interacting with subunits of the PEP complex.
27549111	QTL analysis for chalkiness of rice and fine mapping of a candidate gene for qACE9.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: An ideal appearance is of commercial value for rice varieties. Chalkiness is one of the most important appearance quality indicators. Therefore, clarification of the heredity of chalkiness and its molecular mechanisms will contribute to reduction of rice chalkiness. Although a number of QTLs related to chalkiness were mapped, few of them have been cloned so far.

RESULTS: In this study, using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of PA64s and 9311, we identified 19 QTLs associated with chalkiness on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 12, which accounted for 5.1 to 30.6 % of phenotypic variations. A novel major QTL qACE9 for the area of chalky endosperm (ACE) was detected in Hainan and Hangzhou, both mapped in the overlapping region on chromosome 9. It was further fine mapped to an interval of 22 kb between two insertion-deletion (InDel) markers IND9-4 and IND9-5 using a BC4F2 population. Gene prediction analysis identified five putative genes, among which only one gene (OsAPS1), whose product involved in starch synthesis, was detected two nucleotide substitutions causing amino acid change between the parents. Significant difference was found in apparent amylose content (AAC) between NILqACE9 and 9311. And starch granules were round and loosely packed in NILqACE9 compared with 9311 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis.

CONCLUSIONS: OsAPS1 was selected as a novel candidate gene for fine-mapped qACE9. The candidate gene not only plays a critical role during starch synthesis in endosperm, but also determines the area of chalky endosperm in rice. Further cloning of the QTL will facilitate the improvement of quality in hybrid rice.
27514852	The catalytic subunit of magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase forms a chloroplast complex to regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: YGL8 has the dual functions in Chl biosynthesis: one as a catalytic subunit of MgPME cyclase, the other as a core component of FLU-YGL8-LCAA-POR complex in Chl biosynthesis. Magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (MgPME) cyclase is an essential enzyme involved in chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis. However, its roles in regulating Chl biosynthesis are not fully explored. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant yellow-green leaf 8 (ygl8) that exhibited chlorosis phenotype with abnormal chloroplast development in young leaves. As the development of leaves, the chlorotic plants turned green accompanied by restorations in Chl content and chloroplast ultrastructure. Map-based cloning revealed that the ygl8 gene encodes a catalytic subunit of MgPME cyclase. The ygl8 mutation caused a conserved amino acid substitution (Asn182Ser), which was related to the alterations of Chl precursor content. YGL8 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, with more abundance in young leaves and panicles. Furthermore, we showed that expression levels of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis were affected in both the ygl8 mutant and YGL8 RNA interference lines. By transient expression in rice protoplasts, we found that N-terminal 40 amino acid residues were enough to localize the YGL8 protein to chloroplast. In vivo experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between YGL8 and a rice chloroplast protein, low chlorophyll accumulation A (OsLCAA). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that YGL8 also interacted with the other two rice chloroplast proteins, viz. fluorescent (OsFLU1) and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (OsPORB). These results provide new insights into the roles of YGL8, not only as a subunit with catalytic activity, but as a core component of FLU-YGL8-LCAA-POR complex required for Chl biosynthesis.
27502283	Rice Endosperm Starch Phosphorylase (Pho1) Assembles with Disproportionating Enzyme (Dpe1) to Form a Protein Complex That Enhances Synthesis of Malto-oligosaccharides.	2016	J Biol Chem	Starch synthesis in cereal grain endosperm is dependent on the concerted actions of many enzymes. The starch plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) plays an important role in the initiation of starch synthesis and in the maturation of starch granule in developing rice seeds. Prior evidence has suggested that the rice enzyme, OsPho1, may have a physical/functional interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes. Pulldown experiments showed that OsPho1 as well as OsPho1 devoid of its L80 region, a peptide unique to higher plant phosphorylases, captures disproportionating enzyme (OsDpe1). Interaction of the latter enzyme form with OsDpe1 indicates that the putative regulatory L80 is not responsible for multienzyme assembly. This heterotypic enzyme complex, determined at a molar ratio of 1:1, was validated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies of native seed proteins and by co-elution chromatographic and co-migration electrophoretic patterns of these enzymes in rice seed extracts. The OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex utilized a broader range of substrates for enhanced synthesis of larger maltooligosaccharides than each individual enzyme and significantly elevated the substrate affinities of OsPho1 at 30 °C. Moreover, the assembly with OsDpe1 enables OsPho1 to utilize products of transglycosylation reactions involving G1 and G3, sugars that it cannot catalyze directly.
27570530	Involvement of Polyamine Oxidase-Produced Hydrogen Peroxide during Coleorhiza-Limited Germination of Rice Seeds.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Seed germination is a complicated biological process that requires regulated enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The action of polyamine oxidase (PAO) produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which promotes dicot seed germination. However, whether and, if so, how PAOs regulate monocot seed germination via H2O2 production is unclear. Herein, we report that the coleorhiza is the main physical barrier to radicle protrusion during germination of rice seed (a monocot seed) and that it does so in a manner similar to that of dicot seed micropylar endosperm. We found that H2O2 specifically and steadily accumulated in the coleorhizae and radicles of germinating rice seeds and was accompanied by increased PAO activity as the germination percentage increased. These physiological indexes were strongly decreased in number by guazatine, a PAO inhibitor. We also identified 11 PAO homologs (OsPAO1-11) in the rice genome, which could be classified into four subfamilies (I, IIa, IIb, and III). The OsPAO genes in subfamilies I, IIa, and IIb (OsPAO1-7) encode PAOs, whereas those in subfamily III (OsPAO8-11) encode histone lysine-specific demethylases. In silico-characterized expression profiles of OsPAO1-7 and those determined by qPCR revealed that OsPAO5 is markedly upregulated in imbibed seeds compared with dry seeds and that its transcript accumulated to a higher level in embryos than in the endosperm. Moreover, its transcriptional abundance increased gradually during seed germination in water and was inhibited by 5 mM guazatine. Taken together, these results suggest that PAO-generated H2O2 is involved in coleorhiza-limited rice seed germination and that OsPAO5 expression accounts for most PAO expression and activity during rice seed germination. These findings should facilitate further study of PAOs and provide valuable information for functional validation of these proteins during seed germination of monocot cereals.
27539813	Targeted promoter editing for rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae reveals differential activities for SWEET14-inducing TAL effectors.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	As a key virulence strategy to cause bacterial leaf blight, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) injects into the plant cell DNA-binding proteins called transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that bind to effector-binding elements (EBEs) in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in host gene induction. TALEs AvrXa7, PthXo3, TalC and Tal5, found in geographically distant Xoo strains, all target OsSWEET14, thus considered as a pivotal TALE target acting as major susceptibility factor during rice-Xoo interactions. Here, we report the generation of an allele library of the OsSWEET14 promoter through stable expression of TALE-nuclease (TALEN) constructs in rice. The susceptibility level of lines carrying mutations in AvrXa7, Tal5 or TalC EBEs was assessed. Plants edited in AvrXa7 or Tal5 EBEs were resistant to bacterial strains relying on the corresponding TALE. Surprisingly, although indels within TalC EBE prevented OsSWEET14 induction in response to BAI3 wild-type bacteria relying on TalC, loss of TalC responsiveness failed to confer resistance to this strain. The TalC EBE mutant line was, however, resistant to a strain expressing an artificial SWEET14-inducing TALE whose EBE was also edited in this line. This work offers the first set of alleles edited in TalC EBE and uncovers a distinct, broader range of activities for TalC compared to AvrXa7 or Tal5. We propose the existence of additional targets for TalC beyond SWEET14, suggesting that TALE-mediated plant susceptibility may result from induction of several, genetically redundant, host susceptibility genes by a single effector.
27497286	Rice putative methyltransferase gene OsTSD2 is required for root development involving pectin modification.	2016	J Exp Bot	Pectin synthesis and modification are vital for plant development, although the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of the OsTSD2 gene, which encodes a putative methyltransferase in rice. All three independent T-DNA insertion lines of OsTSD2 displayed dwarf phenotypes and serial alterations in different zones of the root. These alterations included abnormal cellular adhesion and schizogenous aerenchyma formation in the meristematic zone, inhibited root elongation in the elongation zone, and higher lateral root density in the mature zone. Immunofluorescence (with LM19) and Ruthenium Red staining of the roots showed that unesterified homogalacturonan (HG) was increased in Ostsd2 mutants. Biochemical analysis of cell wall pectin polysaccharides revealed that both the monosaccharide composition and the uronic acid content were decreased in Ostsd2 mutants. Increased endogenous ABA content and opposite roles performed by ABA and IAA in regulating cellular adhesion in the Ostsd2 mutants suggested that OsTSD2 is required for root development in rice through a pathway involving pectin synthesis/modification. A hypothesis to explain the relationship among OsTSD2, pectin methylesterification, and root development is proposed, based on pectin's function in regional cell extension/division in a zone-dependent manner.
27512017	The Exonuclease Homolog OsRAD1 Promotes Accurate Meiotic Double-Strand Break Repair by Suppressing Nonhomologous End Joining.	2016	Plant Physiol	During meiosis, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated to initiate homologous recombination, which is crucial for faithful chromosome segregation. In yeast, Radiation sensitive1 (RAD1) acts together with Radiation sensitive9 (RAD9) and Hydroxyurea sensitive1 (HUS1) to facilitate meiotic recombination via cell-cycle checkpoint control. However, little is known about the meiotic functions of these proteins in higher eukaryotes. Here, we characterized a RAD1 homolog in rice (Oryza sativa) and obtained evidence that O. sativa RAD1 (OsRAD1) is important for meiotic DSB repair. Loss of OsRAD1 led to abnormal chromosome association and fragmentation upon completion of homologous pairing and synapsis. These aberrant chromosome associations were independent of OsDMC1. We found that classical nonhomologous end-joining mediated by Ku70 accounted for most of the ectopic associations in Osrad1 In addition, OsRAD1 interacts directly with OsHUS1 and OsRAD9, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB repair during rice meiosis. Together, these findings suggest that the 9-1-1 complex facilitates accurate meiotic recombination by suppressing nonhomologous end-joining during meiosis in rice.
27519312	Evaluation of the Role of the LysM Receptor-Like Kinase, OsNFR5/OsRLK2 for AM Symbiosis in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	In legume-specific rhizobial symbiosis, host plants perceive rhizobial signal molecules, Nod factors, by a pair of LysM receptor-like kinases, NFR1/LYK3 and NFR5/NFP, and activate symbiotic responses through the downstream signaling components also required for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Recently, the rice NFR1/LYK3 ortholog, OsCERK1, was shown to play crucial roles for AM symbiosis. On the other hand, the roles of the NFR5/NFP ortholog in rice have not been elucidated, while it has been shown that NFR5/NFP orthologs, Parasponia PaNFR5 and tomato SlRLK10, engage in AM symbiosis. OsCERK1 also triggers immune responses in combination with a receptor partner, OsCEBiP, against fungal or bacterial infection, thus regulating opposite responses against symbiotic and pathogenic microbes. However, it has not been elucidated how OsCERK1 switches these opposite functions. Here, we analyzed the function of the rice NFR5/NFP ortholog, OsNFR5/OsRLK2, as a possible candidate of the OsCERK1 partner for symbiotic signaling. Inoculation of AM fungi induced the expression of OsNFR5 in the rice root, and the chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of LjNFR5 and the intracellular domain of OsNFR5 complemented the Ljnfr5 mutant for rhizobial symbiosis, indicating that the intracellular kinase domain of OsNFR5 could activate symbiotic signaling in Lotus japonicus. Although these data suggested the possible involvement of OsNFR5 in AM symbiosis, osnfr5 knockout mutants were colonized by AM fungi similar to the wild-type rice. These observations suggested several possibilities including the presence of functionally redundant genes other than OsNFR5 or involvement of novel ligands, which do not require OsNFR5 for recognition.
27555514	A mutagenic study identifying critical residues for the structure and function of rice manganese transporter OsMTP8.1.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa) MTP8.1 (OsMTP8.1) is a tonoplast-localized manganese transporter of the cation diffusion facilitator family. Here we present a structure-function analysis of OsMTP8.1 based on the site-directed and random mutagenesis and complementation assays in manganese hypersensitive yeast, in combination with three-dimensional (3D) structure modeling based on the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli CDF family member, EcYiiP. Two metal-binding sites are conserved in OsMTP8.1 with EcYiiP, one is between transmembrane helices TM2 and TM5, the other is the cytoplasmic C-terminus. In addition to these two metal-binding sites, there may exist other Mn-binding sites such as that at the very end of the CTD. Two residues (R167 and L296) may play an important role for the hinge-like movement of CTDs. Several mutations such as E357A and V374D may affect dimer formation, and S132A may induce a conformational change, resulting in a loss of transport function or modification in metal selectivity. The N-terminus of OsMTP8.1 was not functional for Mn transport activity, and the real function of NTD remains to be investigated in the future. The findings of the present study illustrate the structure-function relationship of OsMTP8.1 in Mn transport activity, which may also be applied to other plant Mn-CDF proteins.

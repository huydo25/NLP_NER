9039500	Characterization and mapping of cDNA encoding aspartate aminotransferase in rice, Oryza sativa L.	1996	DNA Res	Fifteen cDNA clones, putatively identified as encoding aspartate aminotransferase (AST, EC 2.6.1.1.), were isolated and partially sequenced. Together with six previously isolated clones putatively identified to encode ASTs (Sasaki, et al. 1994, Plant Journal 6, 615-624), their sequences were characterized and classified into 4 cDNA species. Two of the isolated clones, C60213 and C2079, were full-length cDNAs, and their complete nucleotide sequences were determined. C60213 was 1612 bp long and its deduced amino acid sequence showed 88% homology with that of Panicum miliaceum L. mitochondrial AST. The C60213-encoded protein had an N-terminal amino acid sequence that was characteristic of a mitochondrial transit peptide. On the other hand, C2079 was 1546 bp long and had 91% amino acid sequence homology with P. miliaceum L. cytosolic AST but lacked in the transit peptide sequence. The homologies of nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of C2079 and C60213 were 54% and 52%, respectively. C2079 and C60213 were mapped on chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively, by restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage analysis. Northern blot analysis using C2079 as a probe revealed much higher transcript levels in callus and root than in green and etiolated shoots, suggesting tissue-specific variations of AST gene expression.
9679197	Isolation and mapping of a family of putative zinc-finger protein cDNAs from rice.	1998	DNA Res	To understand the functions of rice homologues of the Arabidopsis flowering-time gene CONSTANS (CO) and salt-tolerance gene STO, we performed a similarity search of the single-run sequence data of cDNA clones accumulated by the Rice Genome Research Program, and isolated seven rice cDNA clones (S3574, C60910, S12569, R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707) coding for proteins containing one of two zinc-finger-like motifs. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences between these cDNAs and the CO gene revealed significant similarities (46%-61%) in the region of zinc-finger motifs. A domain having a high content of basic amino acids at the C-terminus of the CO protein was found in the corresponding region of proteins predicted by from cDNAs S3574, C60910, and S12569. Two amino acid sequences, "CCADEAAL" and "FCV(L)EDRA," which were present inside each zinc-finger in the Arabidposis regulatory protein STO, were also found in each of the two zinc-finger regions of proteins predicted from cDNAs R2931, R1479, R1577, and E10707. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis, we determined the chromosomal location of the seven cDNA clones. The position of R2931 on the RFLP linkage map was closely linked to Hd-3, one of the putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling heading date in rice.
14729919	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases.	2004	Plant Cell	The disease-resistant Arabidopsis thaliana aberrant growth and death2 (agd2-1) mutant has elevated levels of the defense signal salicylic acid (SA), altered leaf morphology, and mild dwarfism. AGD2 and its close homolog ALD1 (for AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1) encode aminotransferases that act on an overlapping set of amino acids in vitro. However, kinetic parameters indicate that AGD2 and ALD1 may drive the aminotransferase reaction in opposite directions. ALD1-deficient mutants have the opposite phenotypes from agd2-1, showing reduced SA production and increased disease susceptibility. Furthermore, ALD1 transcript levels are elevated in agd2-1 and are induced in the wild type by bacterial pathogen infection. ALD1 is responsible for some of the elevated SA content and a majority of the disease resistance and dwarfism of agd2-1. A complete knockout of AGD2 renders embryos inviable. We suggest that AGD2 synthesizes an important amino acid-derived molecule that promotes development and suppresses defenses, whereas ALD1 generates a related amino acid-derived molecule important for activating defense signaling.
11826307	Functional dissection of a Rice Dr1/DrAp1 transcriptional repression complex.	2002	Plant Cell	We characterized rice cDNA sequences for OsDr1 and OsDrAp1, which encode structural homologs of the eukaryotic general repressors Dr1 and DrAp1, respectively. OsDr1 and OsDrAp1 are nuclear proteins that interact with each other and with the TATA binding protein/DNA complex. In vitro and in vivo functional analyses showed that OsDrAp1 functions as a repressor, unlike its role in other eukaryotic systems, in which DrAp1 is a corepressor. OsDr1 and OsDrAp1 functioned together as a much stronger repressor than either one alone. Functional dissections revealed that the N-terminal histone-fold domains of OsDr1 and OsDrAp1 were necessary and sufficient for their repression and protein-protein interaction with each other. The unique glutamine- and proline-rich domain of OsDr1 had no repression activity. The basic amino acid-rich region and an arginine and glycine repeat domain of OsDrAp1 enhanced its repression activity. Thus, although OsDr1 and OsDrAp1 function as repressors, the functions of the two components are reversed compared with those of their nonplant counterparts.
8525370	A receptor kinase-like protein encoded by the rice disease resistance gene, Xa21.	1995	Science	The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae race 6, was isolated by positional cloning. Fifty transgenic rice plants carrying the cloned Xa21 gene display high levels of resistance to the pathogen. The sequence of the predicted protein, which carries both a leucine-rich repeat motif and a serine-threonine kinase-like domain, suggests a role in cell surface recognition of a pathogen ligand and subsequent activation of an intracellular defense response. Characterization of Xa21 should facilitate understanding of plant disease resistance and lead to engineered resistance in rice.
9286106	Evolution of the rice Xa21 disease resistance gene family.	1997	Plant Cell	The rice disease resistance gene Xa21, encoding a receptor-like kinase, is a member of a multigene family. Sequence analysis of seven family members revealed two distinct classes of genes. One member from each class encodes a receptor kinase-like open reading frame. The other five members encode truncated open reading frames of the predicted receptor kinase. A highly conserved 233-bp sequence (HC) was also identified among the seven family members. Recombination at the HC region between family members apparently resulted in the precise swapping of promoter regions. Large sequence duplications were generated by a presumed unequal crossover event in intergenic regions. Insertions of transposon-like sequences truncated two of the predicted open reading frames. A model for amplification and diversification of the Xa21 gene family is presented.
15069639	Organisation and structural evolution of the rice glutathione S-transferase gene family.	2004	Mol Genet Genomics	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a large family of key defence enzymes against xenobiotic toxicity. Here we describe the comprehensive characterisation of this important multigene family in the model monocot species rice [ Oryza sativa(L.)]. Furthermore, we investigate the molecular evolution of the family based on the analysis of (1) the patterns of within-genome duplication, and (2) the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergence among rice, Arabidopsis, maize and soybean GSTs. By in-silico screening of the EST and genome divisions of the Genbank/EMBL/DDBJ database we have isolated 59 putative genes and two pseudogenes, making this the largest plant GST family characterised to date. Of these, 38 (62%) are represented by genomic and EST sequences and 23 (38%) are known only from their genomic sequences. A preliminary survey of EST collections shows a large degree of variability in gene expression between different tissues and environmental conditions, with a small number of genes (13) accounting for 80% of all ESTs. Rice GSTs are organised in four main phylogenetic classes, with 91% of all rice genes belonging to the two plant-specific classes Tau (40 genes) and Phi (16 genes). Pairwise identity scores range between 17 and 98% for proteins of the same class, and 7 and 21% for interclass comparisons. Rapid evolution by gene duplication is suggested by the discovery of two large clusters of 7 and 23 closely related genes on chromosomes 1 and 10, respectively. A comparison of the complete GST families in two monocot and two dicot species suggests a monophyletic origin for all Theta and Zeta GSTs, and no more than three common ancestors for all Phi and Tau genes.
12077303	Semidwarf (sd-1), "green revolution" rice, contains a defective gibberellin 20-oxidase gene.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The introduction of semidwarf rice (Oryza sativa L.) led to record yield increases throughout Asia in the 1960s. The major semidwarfing allele, sd-1, is still extensively used in modern rice cultivars. The phenotype of sd-1 is consistent with dwarfism that results from a deficiency in gibberellin (GA) plant growth hormones. We propose that the semidwarf (sd-1) phenotype is the result of a deficiency of active GAs in the elongating stem arising from a defective 20-oxidase GA biosynthetic enzyme. Sequence data from the rice genome was combined with previous mapping studies to locate a putative GA 20-oxidase gene (Os20ox2) at the predicted map location of sd-1 on chromosome 1. Two independent sd-1 alleles contained alterations within Os20ox2: a deletion of 280 bp within the coding region of Os20ox2 was predicted to encode a nonfunctional protein in an indica type semidwarf (Doongara), whereas a substitution in an amino acid residue (Leu-266) that is highly conserved among dioxygenases could explain loss of function of Os20ox2 in a japonica semidwarf (Calrose76). The quantification of GAs in elongating stems by GC-MS showed that the initial substrate of GA 20-oxidase activity (GA53) accumulated, whereas the content of the major product (GA20) and of bioactive GA1 was lower in semidwarf compared with tall lines. We propose that the Os20ox2 gene corresponds to the sd-1 locus.
10608658	Plant low-molecular-weight phospholipase A2S (PLA2s) are structurally related to the animal secretory PLA2s and are present as a family of isoforms in rice (Oryza sativa).	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Recently, we purified to homogeneity and characterized a low-molecular-weight calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from developing elm seed endosperm. This represented the first purified and characterized PLA2 from a plant tissue. The full sequences of two distinct but homologous rice (Oryza sativa) cDNAs are given here. These encode mature proteins of 1 19 amino acids (PLA2-I, preceded by a 19 amino acid signal peptide) and 128 amino acids (PLA2-II. preceded by a 25 amino acid signal peptide), and were derived from four expressed sequence tag (EST) clones. Both proteins were homologous to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the elm PLA2. They contained twelve conserved cysteine residues and sequences that are likely to represent the Ca(2+)-binding loop and active-site motif, which are characteristic of animal secretory PLA2s. A soluble PLA2s activity was purified 145 000-fold from green rice shoots. This had the same biochemical characteristics as the elm and animal secretory PLA2s. The purified rice PLA2 consisted of two proteins, with a molecular weight of 12 440 and 12 920, that had identical N-terminal amino acid sequences. This sequence was different from but homologous to the PLA2-I and PLA2-II sequences. Taken together, the results suggest that at least three different low-molecular-weight PLA2s are expressed in green rice shoots. Southern blot analysis suggested that multiple copies of such genes are likely to occur in the rice and in other plant genomes.
12610225	Constitutive expression of a novel-type ammonium transporter OsAMT2 in rice plants.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	To characterize ammonium transport pathways in rice, two cDNAs with high homology to MEP/AMT2-type ammonium transporters, OsAMT2;1 and OsAMT3;1, were isolated. Expression of OsAMT2;1 in an ammonium-uptake-defective yeast mutant showed that this gene encodes functional ammonium transporters. OsAMT2;1 was constitutively expressed in both roots and shoots irrespective of the supply of inorganic nitrogen to the medium, whereas OsAMT3;1 expression was relatively weak. A database search with the amino acid sequence of OsAMT2;1 showed that there are 10 putative OsAMT genes in rice, i.e. three each for OsAMT1, OsAMT2 and OsAMT3, respectively, and one for OsAMT4.
12092832	Cloning and characterization of cDNAs for the jasmonic acid-responsive Genes RRJ1 and RRJ2 in suspension-cultured rice cells.	2002	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Two cDNA clones for jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes, RRJ1 and RRJ2, were isolated by differential screening from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with JA for 2 h. The putative RRJ1 protein is completely identical to that of a putative rice cystathionine gamma-lyase, while the putative RRJ2 protein is highly similar in sequence to a rice pyruvate decarboxylase, PDC1.
15653795	Interaction of N-acetylglutamate kinase with a PII-like protein in rice.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	PII protein in bacteria is a sensor for 2-oxoglutarate and a transmitter for glutamine signaling. We identified an OsGlnB gene that encoded a bacterial PII-like protein in rice. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that an OsGlnB gene product interacted with N-acetylglutamate kinase 1 (OsNAGK1) and PII-like protein (OsGlnB) itself in rice. In cyanobacteria, NAGK is a key enzyme in arginine biosynthesis. Transient expression of OsGlnB cDNA or OsNAGK1 cDNA fused with sGFP in rice leaf blades strongly suggested that the PII-like protein as well as OsNAGK1 protein is located in chloroplasts. Both OsGlnB and OsNAGK1 genes were expressed in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and spikelets of rice, and these two genes were coordinately expressed in leaf blades during the life span. Thus, PII-like protein in rice plants is potentially able to interact with OsNAGK1 protein in vivo. This finding will provide a clue to the precise physiological function of PII-like protein in rice.
12953112	A novel WRKY transcription factor, SUSIBA2, participates in sugar signaling in barley by binding to the sugar-responsive elements of the iso1 promoter.	2003	Plant Cell	SURE (sugar responsive) is a cis element in plant sugar signaling. The SURE element was reported first for potato, in which it confers sugar responsiveness to the patatin promoter. A SURE binding transcription factor has not been isolated. We have isolated a transcription factor cDNA from barley and purified the corresponding protein. The transcription factor, SUSIBA2 (sugar signaling in barley), belongs to the WRKY proteins and was shown to bind to SURE and W-box elements but not to the SP8a element in the iso1 promoter. Nuclear localization of SUSIBA2 was demonstrated in a transient assay system with a SUSIBA2:green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Exploiting the novel transcription factor oligodeoxynucleotide decoy strategy with transformed barley endosperm provided experimental evidence for the importance of the SURE elements in iso1 transcription. Antibodies against SUSIBA2 were produced, and the expression pattern for susiba2 was determined at the RNA and protein levels. It was found that susiba2 is expressed in endosperm but not in leaves. Transcription of susiba2 is sugar inducible, and ectopic susiba2 expression was obtained in sugar-treated leaves. Likewise, binding to SURE elements was observed for nuclear extracts from sugar-treated but not from control barley leaves. The temporal expression of susiba2 in barley endosperm followed that of iso1 and endogenous sucrose levels, with a peak at approximately 12 days after pollination. Our data indicate that SUSIBA2 binds to the SURE elements in the barley iso1 promoter as an activator. Furthermore, they show that SUSIBA2 is a regulatory transcription factor in starch synthesis and demonstrate the involvement of a WRKY protein in carbohydrate anabolism. Orthologs to SUSIBA2 were isolated from rice and wheat endosperm.
14756760	Xa26, a gene conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice, encodes an LRR receptor kinase-like protein.	2004	Plant J	Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. A rice gene, Xa26, conferring resistance against Xoo at both seedling and adult stages was isolated by map-based cloning strategies from the rice cultivar Minghui 63. Xa26 belongs to a multigene family consisting of four members. It encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like protein and is constitutively expressed. Sequence analysis revealed that IRBB3 and Zhachanglong lines that are resistant to a broad range of Xoo strains, also carry Xa26. However, significant difference in lesion length was observed among these lines after inoculation with a set of Xoo strains. Moreover, transgenic plants carrying Xa26 showed enhanced resistance compared with the donor line of the gene in both seedling and adult stages. These results suggest that the resistance conferred by Xa26 is influenced by the genetic background.
1714318	Characterization of an alpha-amylase multigene cluster in rice.	1991	Plant Mol Biol	Rice genomic clones containing eight different alpha-amylase genes have been previously classified into five groups based on DNA hybridization studies and restriction site mapping. This report describes the clustering of three Group 3 genes (RAmy3A, RAmy3B and RAmy3C) within 28 kb of genomic DNA. The genes are separated from each other by about 5 kb and transcribed in the same direction. At the protein level, RAmy3B and RAmy3C are 95% homologous while each is 78% homologous to RAmy3A. All three genes have relatively small introns in the first and third positions. RAmy3A; however, has an additional 409 bp intron in the second intron insertion site. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the coding and 3' flanking regions suggest that clustering of the RAmy3 genes occurred by gene duplication resulting from unequal crossing-over at repetitive sequences. A comparison of the 5' flanking regions revealed several sequences that may be involved in transcription. Expression of RAmy3B/C first appears in the germinating seed after two days and at a higher level after four days. Quantitative primer extension analysis indicates that RAmy3B and RAmy3C contribute 25% and 75%, respectively, of the transcripts from this cluster at four days of germination. No primer extension band specific to RAmy3A transcripts could be detected at this time point. However, RAmy3A PCR products could be amplified from RNA isolated from embryo-derived callus tissue.
2566167	Gene for proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein) is present in both mammalian and higher plant genomes.	1989	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; also called cyclin) was originally described in proliferating mammalian cells as a nuclear protein with an apparent Mr of 33,000-36,000 and recently was found to be a DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein. To elucidate whether PCNA/cyclin is a universal protein necessary for proliferation of eukaryotes, a search was conducted for PCNA/cyclin homologues in higher plants. In Southern blot-hybridization analysis, a rat PCNA/cyclin cDNA probe hybridized with homologous sequences in genomic DNAs from rice, soybean, and tobacco. A PCNA/cyclin-related molecular clone (pCJ-1) was isolated from rice DNA and was partially sequenced. The pCJ-1 probe hybridized with a 1.2-kilobase transcript in RNA from rice root tips and shoots. Immunoblot analysis of the soluble extract of soybean root tips with monospecific anti-PCNA/cyclin identified an immunoreactive protein with an apparent Mr of 34,000. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of an immunoreactive PCNA/cyclin protein in the nuclei of cells in the meristem of soybean root tips. The highly homologous nature of the gene for PCNA/cyclin throughout the animal and plant kingdoms suggests that the product of the gene plays an essential role in DNA replication in eukaryotes.
1671766	Highly conserved structure of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (DNA polymerase delta auxiliary protein) gene in plants.	1991	Eur J Biochem	In a previous paper [Suzuka, I., Daidoji, H., Matsuoka, M., Kadowaki, K., Takasaki, Y., Nakane, P. K. & Moriuchi, T. (1989) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 86, 3189-3193], we demonstrated the presence of a rice genomic-DNA fragment which hybridized with a rat proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) cDNA probe, and proposed that plants possess the homolog of the PCNA gene which plays an essential role in DNA replication in mammals. Here we show that the sequence of the rice PCNA gene supports this proposal. The rice gene consists of four exons. The 5'-flanking region contains a variety of sequences similar to several consensus sequences believed to be important for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Determination of the transcription-start site and the structure of the 3'-flanking region of the gene indicated that the coded mRNA is 1073 bases. The rice PCNA genomic and cDNA clones are composed of 789 nucleotides; they encode a putative protein of 263 amino acids having a molecular mass of 29275 Da. Comparison of the coding regions of rice PCNA and rat PCNA revealed about 64% similarity at the nucleotide level and about 62% similarity at the amino acid level. Furthermore, comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the soybean PCNA with the rice PCNA sequence indicated a high degree of similarity (88%). The structural similarity between PCNA from plants and animals, despite the distant evolutionary relationship, indicates a strong selection pressure for conservation of this structure and suggests the presence of conserved DNA-replication mechanisms throughout the eukaryotes.
9370307	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed.	1997	Gene	Three elements in the promoter of rice glutelin genes are important for their endosperm specific expression. One of these, an AACA motif, has been shown to be a negative regulator in non-seed tissues and has a similarity to the barley gibberellin responsive element recognized by MYB-like DNA binding proteins. A cDNA library constructed from immature rice seed was screened using two types of myb gene probes to isolate cDNA clones representing genes encoding MYB-like DNA binding proteins that may recognize the AACA motif in rice glutelin gene promoter. We obtained four cDNA clones encoding MYB-related proteins, Oryza sativa MYB (OSMYB) 1-4, using the maize C1 probe. Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3. RT-PCR was used to analyze Osmyb expression during rice seed development and their presence in other rice tissues, as it was not possible to detect these mRNAs by conventional Northern analysis. RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined. In seed, the mRNA levels of Osmyb1 and Osmyb4 genes reached a maximum at 14 days after flowering (DAF), suggesting that these genes may play a role in seed maturation. As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes.
12815035	Cloning and expression of a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase gene in rice.	2003	J Exp Bot	A cDNA fragment was cloned from rice immature seeds by the RT-PCR method. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA showed a high degree of identity with UDP-d-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) from other plants and was most similar to the soluble UXS from Arabidopsis. The recombinant protein, expressed in an Escherichia coli system, catalysed the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronic acid to UDP-d-xylose, confirming that the gene encoded UXS. The uxs gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the uxs gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period. This is the first report of the cloning of the uxs gene from monocots.
15488465	Characterization of soluble and putative membrane-bound UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (OsUXS) isoforms in rice.	2004	Arch Biochem Biophys	Arabinoxylans in crop plants are the major sugar components of the cell walls, and UDP-xylose is a key substrate in the biosynthesis of xylans. In this study, the six putative UDP-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase genes from rice (Oryza sativa UDP-xylose synthase; OsUXS) were cloned. Except for the soluble form of OsUXS3 (GenBank Accession No. \AB079064), the remaining five OsUXS enzymes contain a putative membrane-bound region. The six OsUXS genes were classified into three types by phylogenetic analysis and were expressed during the development of rice seeds. The HPLC retention times of the enzyme products and NMR data, indicate that the recombinant OsUXS2 enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-D-xylose. Interestingly, the reactions catalyzed by the recombinant OsUXS2 and OsUXS3 enzymes were inhibited by NADP+, and accelerated by NADPH. The catalytic activities of the recombinant OsUXS2 and OsUXS3 enzymes were strongly inhibited by UDP, UTP, TDP, and TTP. The expression levels of OsUXS genes changed in different manners during the development of rice seeds, suggesting that each corresponding OsUXS enzyme plays a significant role in rice seed development at a certain stage. In the present study, we report that the UXS2-type enzyme of rice is not only characterized for the first time but also show significant findings involved in the gene expression of OsUXSs.
11444698	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of a highly conserved rice mago nashil homolog.	2001	Genome	Mago Nashi, a protein initially shown to be essential in the development of the Drosophila oocyte, is highly conserved among species and shows no homology to any other known cellular proteins. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA and a partial gene that encode rice Mago Nashi protein homologs. In addition, we present the tissue-specific expression pattern of mago nashi at the level of RNA and protein. The rice Mago Nashi protein shares at least 73% amino acid identity with all known animal homologs. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicates that two copies of the mago nashi gene exist in the rice genome, one of which has identical intron positions to those found in an Arabidopsis homolog. mago nashi is expressed in root, leaf and developing seed tissue as determined by RNA and protein gel blot analysis. Evidence from Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and human studies of Mago Nashi suggests that a major function of this protein is its involvement in RNA localization. The highly conserved amino acid sequence of all Mago Nashi protein homologs across kingdoms suggests that the plant version of this protein may similarly be involved in RNA localization.
15918879	Severe reduction in growth rate and grain filling of rice mutants lacking OsGS1;1, a cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;1.	2005	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants possess three homologous but distinct genes for cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1): these are OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3. OsGS1;1 was expressed in all organs tested with higher expression in leaf blades, while OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3 were expressed mainly in roots and spikelets, respectively. We characterized knockout mutants caused by insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 into the exon-8 (lines ND8037 and ND9801) or the exon-10 (line NC2327) of OsGS1;1. Mendelian segregation occurred in each progeny. Homozygously inserted mutants showed severe retardation in growth rate and grain filling when grown at normal nitrogen concentrations. Abnormal mRNA for GS1;1 was transcribed, and the GS1 protein and its activity in the leaf blades were barely detectable in these mutants. The glutamine pool in the roots and leaf blades of the mutants was lower than that of the wild type. Re-introduction of OsGS1;1 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the mutants successfully complemented these phenotypes. Progeny where Tos17 was heterozygously inserted or deleted during segregation showed normal phenotypes. The results indicate that GS1;1 is important for normal growth and grain filling in rice; GS1;2 and GS1;3 were not able to compensate for GS1;1 function.

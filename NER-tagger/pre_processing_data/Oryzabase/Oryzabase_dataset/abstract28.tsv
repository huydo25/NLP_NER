19419967	Arabidopsis HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER protein methylates a glucosinolate breakdown product and functions in resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola.	2009	J Biol Chem	Almost all of the chlorine-containing gas emitted from natural sources is methyl chloride (CH(3)Cl), which contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. Tropical and subtropical plants emit substantial amounts of CH(3)Cl. A gene involved in CH(3)Cl emission from Arabidopsis was previously identified and designated HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER (hereafter AtHOL1) based on the mutant phenotype. Our previous studies demonstrated that AtHOL1 and its homologs, AtHOL2 and AtHOL3, have S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activities. However, the physiological functions of AtHOLs have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, our comparative kinetic analyses with possible physiological substrates indicated that all of the AtHOLs have low activities toward chloride. AtHOL1 was highly reactive to thiocyanate (NCS(-)), a pseudohalide, synthesizing methylthiocyanate (CH(3)SCN) with a very high k(cat)/K(m) value. We demonstrated in vivo that substantial amounts of NCS(-) were synthesized upon tissue damage in Arabidopsis and that NCS(-) was largely derived from myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates. Analyses with the T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutants (hol1, hol2, and hol3) revealed that only hol1 showed increased sensitivity to NCS(-) in medium and a concomitant lack of CH(3)SCN synthesis upon tissue damage. Bacterial growth assays indicated that the conversion of NCS(-) into CH(3)SCN dramatically increased antibacterial activities against Arabidopsis pathogens that normally invade the wound site. Furthermore, hol1 seedlings showed an increased susceptibility toward an Arabidopsis pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. Here we propose that AtHOL1 is involved in glucosinolate metabolism and defense against phytopathogens. Moreover, CH(3)Cl synthesized by AtHOL1 could be considered a byproduct of NCS(-) metabolism.
22836167	Transcriptional network analysis of the tryptophan-accumulating rice mutant during grain filling.	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	In a previous study, we selected a high tryptophan (Trp)-accumulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant line by in vitro mutagenesis using gamma rays. To obtain detailed information about the Trp biosynthetic pathway during the grain-filling in rice, we investigated the gene expression profiles in the wild-type (cv. Dongan) and the high-level Trp-accumulating mutant line (MRVII-33) at five different grain-filling stages using microarray analysis. The mutant line showed approximately 6.3-fold higher Trp content and 2.3-fold higher amino acids compared with the original cultivar at the final stage (stage V). The intensity of gene expression was analyzed and compared between the wild-type and mutant line at each of the five grain-filling stages using the Rice 4 × 44K oligo DNA microarray. Among the five stages, stage III showed the highest gene expression changes for both up- and down-regulated genes. Among the Trp biosynthesis-related genes, trpG showed high expression in the mutant line during stages I to IV and trpE showed higher at stage III. Gene clustering was performed based on the genes of KEGG's amino acid metabolism, and a total of 276 genes related to amino acid metabolism were placed into three clusters. The functional annotation enrichment analysis of the genes classified into the three clusters was also conducted using ClueGO. It was found that cluster 3 uniquely included biological processes related to aromatic amino acid metabolism. These results suggest that gene analysis based on microarray data is useful for elucidating the biological mechanisms of Trp accumulation in high Trp-accumulating mutants at each of the grain-filling stages.
22942769	Molecular characterization and comparative sequence analysis of defense-related gene, Oryza rufipogon receptor-like protein kinase 1.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	Many of the plant leucine rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) have been found to regulate signaling during plant defense processes. In this study, we selected and sequenced an LRR-RLK gene, designated as Oryza rufipogon receptor-like protein kinase 1 (OrufRPK1), located within yield QTL yld1.1 from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon (accession IRGC105491). A 2055 bp coding region and two exons were identified. Southern blotting determined OrufRPK1 to be a single copy gene. Sequence comparison with cultivated rice orthologs (OsI219RPK1, OsI9311RPK1 and OsJNipponRPK1, respectively derived from O. sativa ssp. indica cv. MR219, O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 9311 and O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) revealed the presence of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with five non-synonymous substitutions, and 23 insertion/deletion sites. The biological role of the OrufRPK1 as a defense related LRR-RLK is proposed on the basis of cDNA sequence characterization, domain subfamily classification, structural prediction of extra cellular domains, cluster analysis and comparative gene expression.
23053954	Genome-wide identification, classification and expression analysis of genes encoding putative fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.).	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs), a subclass of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), have both predicted AGP-like glycosylated regions and putative fasciclin (FAS) domains, which may function in cell adhesion and communication. Previous studies have identified 21, 27, and 34 FLAs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively. In this study, we identified 33 FLAs in the annotated genome of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42). Sequence analysis indicated that FAS domains each contain two highly conserved regions, named H1 and H2, and that 17 FLAs from B. rapa (BrFLAs) possess both of these regions. Prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification sites suggested that 15 BrFLAs were GPI-anchored to the plasma membrane. Additionally, 25 BrFLAs may have been duplicated during the processes that shaped the triplicated genome of the mesopolyploid B. rapa. Expression analyses indicated that BrFLA1, BrFLA11, BrFLA13, BrFLA28 and BrFLA32 were specifically expressed in inflorescence. Meanwhile, BrFLA9 (homologous to AtFLA12) is specifically expressed in stem, and BrFLA6/22 (homologous to AtFLA11) is also highly expressed in stem, suggesting BrFLA6/9/22 may have the same functions as AtFLA11/12 in A. thaliana. Taken together, the identification and bioinformatic analysis of FLAs in B. rapa will open the way for studying their biological functions in plant growth and development as well as evolutionary history of this gene family from A. thaliana to B. rapa.
17448255	Phylogenetic and functional analysis of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family: improved signature and prediction of substrate specificity.	2007	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family is a ubiquitous family of heavy metal transporters. Much interest in this family has focused on implications for human health and bioremediation. In this work a broad phylogenetic study has been undertaken which, considered in the context of the functional characteristics of some fully characterised CDF transporters, has aimed at identifying molecular determinants of substrate selectivity and at suggesting metal specificity for newly identified CDF transporters.

RESULTS: Representative CDF members from all three kingdoms of life (Archaea, Eubacteria, Eukaryotes) were retrieved from genomic databases. Protein sequence alignment has allowed detection of a modified signature that can be used to identify new hypothetical CDF members. Phylogenetic reconstruction has classified the majority of CDF family members into three groups, each containing characterised members that share the same specificity towards the principally-transported metal, i.e. Zn, Fe/Zn or Mn. The metal selectivity of newly identified CDF transporters can be inferred by their position in one of these groups. The function of some conserved amino acids was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis in the poplar Zn2+ transporter PtdMTP1 and compared with similar experiments performed in prokaryotic members. An essential structural role can be assigned to a widely conserved glycine residue, while aspartate and histidine residues, highly conserved in putative transmembrane domains, might be involved in metal transport. The potential role of group-conserved amino acid residues in metal specificity is discussed.

CONCLUSION: In the present study phylogenetic and functional analyses have allowed the identification of three major substrate-specific CDF groups. The metal selectivity of newly identified CDF transporters can be inferred by their position in one of these groups. The modified signature sequence proposed in this work can be used to identify new hypothetical CDF members.
16230331	OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	The Ypt/Rab family of small G-proteins is important in regulating vesicular transport. Rabs hydrolyze GTP very slowly on their own and require GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we report the identification and characterization of OsGAP1, a Rab-specific rice GAP. OsGAP1 strongly stimulated OsRab8a and OsRab11, which are homologs of the mammalian Rab8 and Rab11 proteins that are essential for Golgi to plasma membrane (PM) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to PM trafficking, respectively. Substitution of two invariant arginines within the catalytic domain of Oryza sativa GTPase-activating protein 1 (OsGAP1) with alanines significantly inhibited its GAP activity. In vivo targeting experiments revealed that OsGAP1 localizes to the TGN or pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC). A yeast expression system demonstrated that wild-type OsGAP1 facilitates O. sativa dissociation inhibitor 3 (OsGDI3)-catalyzed OsRab11 recycling at an early stage, but the OsGAP1(R385A) and (R450A) mutants do not. Thus, GTP hydrolysis is essential for Rab recycling. Moreover, expression of the OsGAP1 mutants in Arabidopsis protoplasts inhibited the trafficking of some cargo proteins, including the PM-localizing H+-ATPase-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Ca2+-ATPase8-GFP and the central vacuole-localizing Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP)-GFP. The OsGAP1 mutants caused these proteins to accumulate at the Golgi apparatus. Surprisingly, OsRab11 overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the OsGAP1 mutants on vesicular trafficking. OsRab8a had no such effect. Thus, the OsGAP1 mutants may inhibit TGN to PM or central vacuole trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous Rab11. We propose that OsGAP1 facilitates vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the PM or central vacuole by both stimulating the GTPase activity of OsRab11 and increasing the recycling of inactive OsRab11.
16415208	Members of a novel class of Arabidopsis Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors control Rho GTPase-dependent polar growth.	2006	Plant Cell	Rho family small GTPases are signaling switches controlling many eukaryotic cellular processes. Conversion from the GDP- to GTP-bound form is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Rho GEFs in animals fall into two structurally distinct classes containing DH and DOCKER catalytic domains. Using a plant Rho GTPase (ROP1) as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified a family of Rho GEFs, named RopGEFs. The Arabidopsis thaliana RopGEF family of 14 members contains a conserved central domain, the domain of unknown function 315 (DUF315), and variable N- and C-terminal regions. In vitro GEF assays show that DUF315 but not the full-length version of RopGEF1 has high GEF activity toward ROP1. Our data suggest that the variable regions of RopGEF1 are involved in regulation of RopGEF through an autoinhibitory mechanism. RopGEF1 overexpression in pollen tubes produced growth depolarization, as does a constitutively active ROP1 mutant. The RopGEF1 overexpression phenotype was suppressed by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ROP1, probably by trapping RopGEF1. Deletion mutant analysis suggested a requirement of RopGEF activity for the function of RopGEF1 in polar growth. Green fluorescent protein-tagged RopGEF1 was localized to the tip of pollen tubes where ROP1 is activated. These results provide strong evidence that RopGEF1 activates ROP1 in control of polar growth in pollen tubes.
11673635	Antisense expression of a rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2001	Plant Cell Physiol	We analyzed the function of a rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, by using antisense rice. There was no difference between antisense and wild-type plants in carbohydrate content and photosynthetic ability of the flag leaves in the vegetative growth stage, suggesting that OsSUT1 may not play an important role in carbon metabolism, at least in these materials.
17138625	The role of the sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, in germination and early seedling growth and development of rice plants.	2007	J Exp Bot	Using expression analysis, the role of the sucrose transporter OsSUT1 during germination and early growth of rice seedlings has been examined in detail, over a time-course ranging from 1 d to 7 d post-imbibition. Unlike the wheat orthologue, TaSUT1, which is thought to be directly involved in sugar transfer across the scutellar epithelium, OsSUT1 is not expressed in the scutellar epithelial cell layer of germinating rice and is, therefore, not involved in transport of sugars across the symplastic discontinuity between the endosperm and the embryo. OsSUT1 expression was also absent from the aleurone cells, indicating it is not involved in the transport of sucrose in this cell layer during germination. However, by 3 d post-imbibition, OsSUT1 was present in the companion cells and sieve elements of the scutellar vascular bundle, where it may play a role in phloem loading of sucrose for transport to the developing shoot and roots. This sucrose is most likely sourced from hexoses imported from the endosperm. In addition, sucrose may be remobilized from starch granules which are present at a high density in the scutellar ground tissues surrounding the vasculature and at the base of the shoot. OsSUT1 was also present in the coleoptile and the first and second leaf blades, where it was localized to the phloem along the entire length of these tissues, and was also present within the phloem of the primary roots. OsSUT1 may be involved in retrieval of sugars from the apoplasm in these tissues.
17587305	Functional analysis of a NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC6 involved in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression in rice.	2007	Plant J	The OsNAC6 gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice. Expression of OsNAC6 is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity. OsNAC6 gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease. A transactivation assay using a yeast system demonstrated that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator, and transient localization studies with OsNAC6-sGFP fusion protein revealed its nuclear localization. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6 constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields. These transgenic rice plants showed an improved tolerance to dehydration and high-salt stresses, and also exhibited increased tolerance to blast disease. By utilizing stress-inducible promoters, such as the OsNAC6 promoter, it is hoped that stress-inducible over-expression of OsNAC6 in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of OsNAC6 on growth under normal growth conditions. The results of microarray analysis revealed that many genes that are inducible by abiotic and biotic stresses were upregulated in rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6. A transient transactivation assay showed that OsNAC6 activates the expression of at least two genes, including a gene encoding peroxidase. Collectively, these results indicate that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. We conclude that OsNAC6 may serve as a useful biotechnological tool for the improvement of stress tolerance in various kinds of plants.
16172526	OsNAC6, a member of the NAC gene family, is induced by various stresses in rice.	2005	Genes Genet Syst	Members of the NAC gene family encode plant-specific transcription factors and are widely distributed in plant species. The OsNAC6 gene is one of many NAC genes in rice and has high similarity to genes in the ATAF subfamily. Here we show that OsNAC6 is induced by cold, salt, drought and abscisic acid (ABA). We found that OsNAC6 is also induced by wounding. The response of OsNAC6 to wounding is very rapid and strong. OsNAC6 was also induced by jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone that activates defense responses against herbivores and pathogens. Our results imply that OsNAC6, besides having a role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses, also integrates signals derived from both abiotic and biotic stresses.
15029955	Comprehensive analysis of NAC family genes in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana.	2003	DNA Res	The NAC domain was originally characterized from consensus sequences from petunia NAM and from Arabidopsis ATAF1, ATAF2, and CUC2. Genes containing the NAC domain (NAC family genes) are plant-specific transcriptional regulators and are expressed in various developmental stages and tissues. We performed a comprehensive analysis of NAC family genes in Oryza sativa (a monocot) and Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot). We found 75 predicted NAC proteins in full-length cDNA data sets of O. sativa (28,469 clones) and 105 in putative genes (28,581 sequences) from the A. thaliana genome. NAC domains from both predicted and known NAC family proteins were classified into two groups and 18 subgroups by sequence similarity. There were a few differences in amino acid sequences in the NAC domains between O. sativa and A. thaliana. In addition, we found 13 common sequence motifs from transcriptional activation regions in the C-terminal regions of predicted NAC proteins. These motifs probably diverged having correlations with NAC domain structures. We discuss the relationship between the structure and function of the NAC family proteins in light of our results and the published data. Our results will aid further functional analysis of NAC family genes.
19897605	The Arabidopsis tandem zinc finger protein AtTZF1 traffics between the nucleus and cytoplasmic foci and binds both DNA and RNA.	2010	Plant Physiol	Processing bodies (PBs) are specialized cytoplasmic foci where mRNA turnover and translational repression can take place. Stress granules are related cytoplasmic foci. The CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins (TZFs) play pivotal roles in gene expression, cell fate specification, and various developmental processes. Human TZF binds AU-rich elements at the 3' untranslated region and recruits decapping, deadenylation, and exonucleolytic enzymes to PBs for RNA turnover. Recent genetic studies indicate that plant TZFs are involved in gene regulation and hormone-mediated environmental responses. It is unknown if plant TZFs can bind RNA and be localized to PBs or stress granules. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtTZF1/AtCTH/AtC3H23 was identified as a sugar-sensitive gene in a previous microarray study. It is characterized by a TZF motif that is distinct from the human TZF. Higher plants such as Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) each have a gene family containing this unique TZF motif. Here, we show that AtTZF1 can traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasmic foci. AtTZF1 colocalizes with markers of PBs, and the morphology of these cytoplasmic foci resembles that of mammalian PBs and stress granules. AtTZF1-associated cytoplasmic foci are dynamic and tissue specific. They can be induced by dark and wound stresses and are preferentially present in actively growing tissues and stomatal precursor cells. Since AtTZF1 can bind both DNA and RNA in vitro, it raises the possibility that AtTZF1 might be involved in DNA and/or RNA regulation.
19712067	A novel simple extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domain protein from rice (OsLRR1) enters the endosomal pathway and interacts with the hypersensitive-induced reaction protein 1 (OsHIR1).	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) containing an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain play important roles in plant disease resistance. Simple eLRR domain proteins structurally resembling the extracellular portion of the RLKs may also participate in signalling transduction and plant defence response. Yet the molecular mechanisms and subcellular localization in regulating plant disease resistance of these simple eLRR domain proteins are still largely unclear. We provided the first experimental evidence to demonstrate the subcellular localization and trafficking of a novel simple eLRR domain protein (OsLRR1) in the endosomal pathway, using both confocal and electron microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays show that OsLRR1 interacts with the rice hypersensitive-induced response protein 1 (OsHIR1) which is localized on plasma membrane. The interaction between LRR1 and HIR1 homologs was shown to be highly conserved among different plant species, suggesting a close functional relationship between the two proteins. The function of OsLRR1 in plant defence response was examined by gain-of-function tests using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The protective effects of OsLRR1 against bacterial pathogen infection were shown by the alleviating of disease symptoms, lowering of pathogen titres and higher expression of defence marker genes.
19816724	The polyembryo gene (OsPE) in rice.	2010	Funct Integr Genomics	T-DNA insertional mutagenesis is one of the most important approaches for gene discovery and cloning. A fertile polyembryo mutant generated by T-DNA/Ds insertion in Oryza sativa, cv. Basmati 370 showed twin or triple seedlings at a frequency of 15-20%. T-DNA insertion was confirmed by 950 bp hpt gene amplification in the promoter region of the candidate gene. The annotated protein corresponding to the OsPE candidate gene has been reported as a hypothetical protein in O. sativa. OsPE gene lacked functional homologs in other species. No OsPE paralog was found in rice. No conserved domains were found in the protein coded by OsPE. RT-PCR showed the expression of OsPE gene in Basmati 370 shoots. Full-length OsPE gene was cloned in Basmati 370. The combined use of Southern blot, genome walking, TAIL-PCR, RT-PCR techniques, and bioinformatics led to the identification of a candidate gene controlling the multiple embryos in rice. There is gain of function, i.e., multiple embryos in the seeds in the knockout mutant OsPE whereas its wild-type allele strictly controls single embryo per seed. The seeds with multiple embryos are distributed at random in the rice mutant panicle. The origin of multiple embryos, whether apomictic, zygotic or both is under investigation.
20178989	The lycopene cyclase CrtY from Pantoea ananatis (formerly Erwinia uredovora) catalyzes an FADred-dependent non-redox reaction.	2010	J Biol Chem	The cyclization of lycopene generates provitamin A carotenoids such as beta-carotene and paves the way toward the formation of cyclic xanthophylls playing distinct roles in photosynthesis and as precursors for regulatory molecules in plants and animals. The biochemistry of lycopene cyclization has been enigmatic, as the previously proposed acid-base catalysis conflicted with the possibility of redox catalysis as predicted by the presence of a dinucleotide binding site. We show that reduced FAD is the essential lycopene cyclase (CrtY) cofactor. Using flavin analogs, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis, evidence was obtained based on which a catalytic mechanism relying on cryptic (net) electron transfer can be refuted. The role of reduced FAD is proposed to reside in the stabilization of a transition state carrying a (partial) positive charge or of a positively charged intermediate via a charge transfer interaction, acid-base catalysis serving as the underlying catalytic principle. Lycopene cyclase, thus, ranks among the novel class of non-redox flavoproteins, such as isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase type 2 (IDI-2) that requires the reduced form of the cofactor.
22207384	[Genetic analysis and gene mapping of DDF1, a pleiotropic gene involving in both vegetable and reproductive growth in rice].	2011	Yi Chuan	There are many pleiotropic genes playing key roles in regulating both vegetative growth and reproductive development in plants. A dwarf mutant of rice with deformed flowers, named as ddf1, was identified from indica rice breeding lines. Genetic analysis indicated that ddf1 was resulted from the recessive mutation of a single gene, temporarily named as DDF1. This result suggested that DDF1 is a pleiotropic gene, which controls both vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice. To map this gene, an F2 population was developed by crossing the ddf1 heterozygote with the tropical japonica rice variety DZ60. By means of bulked segregant analysis and small population-based linkage analysis using the published RM-series rice SSR markers, DDF1 was preliminarily mapped in a region between markers RM588 and RM587 on chromosome 6 with the genetic distances of 3.8 cM and 2.4 cM to the two markers, respectively. By developing new SSR markers in this interval according to the published rice genome sequence, we further mapped DDF1 in a 165 kb interval. The results will facilitate cloning of DDF1.
17428833	Responses of rice cultivars with different nitrogen use efficiency to partial nitrate nutrition.	2007	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is increased evidence that partial nitrate (NO3-) nutrition (PNN) improves growth of rice (Oryza sativa), although the crop prefers ammonium (NH4+) to NO3- nutrition. It is not known whether the response to NO3- supply is related to nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) in rice cultivars. Methods Solution culture experiments were carried out to study the response of two rice cultivars, Nanguang (High-NUE) and Elio (Low-NUE), to partial NO3- supply in terms of dry weight, N accumulation, grain yield, NH4+ uptake and ammonium transporter expression [real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)].

KEY RESULTS: A ratio of 75/25 NH4+ -N/NO3- -N increased dry weight, N accumulation and grain yield of 'Nanguang' by 30, 36 and 21 %, respectively, but no effect was found in 'Elio' when compared with those of 100/0 NH4+ -N/NO3- -N. Uptake experiments with 15N-NH4+ showed that NO3- increased NH4+ uptake efficiency in 'Nanguang' by increasing Vmax (14 %), but there was no effect on Km. This indicated that partial replacement of NH4+ by NO3- could increase the number of the ammonium transporters but did not affect the affinity of the transporters for NH4+. Real-time PCR showed that expression of OsAMT1s in 'Nanguang' was improved by PNN, while that in 'Elio' did not change, which is in accordance with the differing responses of these two cultivars to PNN. Conclusions Increased NUE by PNN can be attributed to improved N uptake. The rice cultivar with a higher NUE has a more positive response to PNN than that with a low NUE, suggesting that there might be a relationship between PNN and NUE.
23184051	Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes. This review focuses on the conventional breeding to the latest molecular progress in blast disease resistance in rice. This update information will be helpful guidance for rice breeders to develop durable blast resistant rice variety through marker assisted selection.
16908506	High-level tryptophan accumulation in seeds of transgenic rice and its limited effects on agronomic traits and seed metabolite profile.	2006	J Exp Bot	Metabolic manipulation of plants to improve their nutritional quality is an important goal of plant biotechnology. Expression in rice (Oryza sativa L.) of a transgene (OASA1D) encoding a feedback-insensitive alpha subunit of rice anthranilate synthase results in the accumulation of tryptophan (Trp) in calli and leaves. It is shown here that the amount of free Trp in the seeds of such plants is increased by about two orders of magnitude compared with that in the seeds of wild-type plants. The total Trp content in the seeds of the transgenic plants was also increased. Two homozygous lines, HW1 and HW5, of OASA1D transgenic rice were generated for characterization of agronomic traits and aromatic metabolite profiling of seeds. The marked overproduction of Trp was stable in these lines under field conditions, although spikelet fertility and yield, as well as seed germination ability, were reduced compared with the wild type. These differences in agronomic traits were small, however, in HW5. In spite of the high Trp content in the seeds of the HW lines, metabolic profiling revealed no substantial changes in the amounts of other phenolic compounds. The amount of indole acetic acid was increased about 2-fold in the seeds of the transgenic lines. The establishment and characterization of these OASA1D transgenic lines have thus demonstrated the feasibility of increasing the Trp content in the seeds of rice (or of other crops) as a means of improving its nutritional value for human consumption or animal feed.
23053415	Rice P450 reductases differentially affect P450-mediated metabolism in bacterial expression systems.	2013	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	We describe cloning and characterization of three rice (Oryza sativa) NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (OsCPRs; E.C.1.6.2.4) that are potential donors to plant P450s, including tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H) in serotonin synthesis and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) in phenylpropanoid synthesis. All three OsCPR transcripts are induced to varying degrees by stresses. Co-expression of full-length OsCPR1, OsCPR2 and OsCPR3 with either T5H or C4H in E. coli indicated that the OsCPR2/T5H and OsCPR2/C4H constructs displayed the highest T5H and C4H catalytic activities. The N-terminal residues of OsCPR2 were required for peak electron transfer activity to P450 even though deletion mutants with short N-terminal deletions were capable of reducing cytochrome c.
23082824	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: It is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues. However, it remains largely unexplored whether old and young tissues have different regulatory mechanism during adaptation of plants to salt stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance.

RESULTS: Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress. In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells. Under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of NO3- content than young leaves. Up-regulation of OsNRT1;2, a gene coding nitrate transporter, might contribute to the accumulation of NO3- in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves.

CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of Na+ and Cl-. Under salt stress, rice might accumulate Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in old leaves. This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice. Excesses of Na+ and Cl- also might change the pathway of NH4+ assimilation in old leaves of salt stressed rice plants, weaken GOGAT/GS pathway and elevate GDH pathway.
17301500	Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance.	2006	J Biosci	Expression of HpaG(Xoo), a bacterial type-III effector, in transgenic plants induces disease resistance. Resistance also can be elicited by biocontrol bacteria. In both cases, plant growth is often promoted. Here we address whether biocontrol bacteria and HpaG(Xoo) can act together to provide better results in crop improvement. We studied effects of Pseudomonas cepacia on the rice variety R109 and the hpaG(Xoo)-expressing rice line HER1. Compared to R109, HER1 showed increased growth, grain yield, and defense responses toward diseases and salinity stress. Colonization of roots by P. cepacia caused 20% and 13% increase, in contrast to controls, in root growth of R109 and HER1. Growth of leaves and stems also increased in R109 but that of HER1 was inhibited. When P. cepacia colonization was subsequent to plant inoculation with Rhizoctonia solani, a pathogen that causes sheath blight, the disease was less severe than controls in both R109 and HER1; HER1, nevertheless, was more resistant, suggesting that P. cepacia and HpaG(Xoo) cooperate in inducing disease resistance. Several genes that critically regulate growth and defense behaved differentially in HER1 and R109 while responding to P. cepacia. In R109 leaves, the OsARF1 gene, which regulates plant growth, was expressed in consistence with growth promotion by P. cepacia. Inversely, OsARF1 expression was coincident with inhibition in growth of HER1 leaves. In both plants, the expression of OsEXP1, which encodes an expansin protein involved in plant growth,was concomitant with growth promotion in leaves instead of roots,in response to P. cepacia . We also studied OsMAPK, a gene that encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase and controls defense responses toward salinity and infection by pathogens in rice. In response to P. cepacia, an early expression of OsMAPK was coincident with R109 resistance to the disease, while HER1 expressed the gene similarly whether P. cepacia was present or not. Evidently, P. cepacia and G(Xoo)-gene mediated resistance may act differently in rice growth and resistance. Whereas combinative effects of P. cepacia and HpaG(Xoo) in disease resistance have a great potential in agricultural use, it is interesting to study mechanisms that underlie interactions involving biocontrol bacteria, type-III effectors and pathogens.
21422823	New insights into the signaling pathways controlling defense gene expression in rice roots during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Mycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of most plant species. This association provides the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus with sugars while the fungus improves the uptake of water and mineral nutrients in the host plant. Moreover, the induction of defence gene expression in mycorrhizal roots has been described. While salicylic acid (SA)-regulated Pathogenesis-Related (PR) proteins accumulate in rice roots colonized by the AM fungus G. intraradices, the SA content is not significantly altered in the mycorrhizal roots. Sugars, in addition to being a source of carbon for the fungus, might act as signals for the control of defence gene expression. We hypothesize that increased demands for sugars by the fungus might be responsible for the activation of the host defence responses which will then contribute to the stabilization of root colonization by the AM fungus. An excessive root colonization might change a mutualistic association into a parasitic association.
21595879	A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase is expressed in cortical root cells during the presymbiotic phase of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis consists of a mutualistic relationship between soil fungi and roots of most plant species. This association provides the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus with sugars while the fungus improves the uptake of water and mineral nutrients in the host plant. Then, the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis requires the fine tuning of host gene expression for recognition and accommodation of the fungal symbiont. In plants, calcium plays a key role as second messenger during developmental processes and responses to environmental stimuli. Even though calcium transients are known to occur in host cells during the AM symbiosis, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood.

RESULTS: The expression of seventeen Calcium-dependent Protein Kinase (CPK) genes representative of the four distinct phylogenetic groups of rice CPKs was monitored during the presymbiotic phase of the AM symbiosis. Among them, OsCPK18 and OsCPK4, were found to be transcriptionally activated in response to inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices. OsCPK18 and OsCPK4 gene expression was also up-regulated by fungal-produced diffusible molecules. Laser microdissection revealed expression of OsCPK18 in cortical cells, and not in epidermal cells of G. intraradices-inoculated rice roots, suggesting a preferential role of this gene in the root cortex. Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK18 in onion epidermal cells. We also show that the myristoylation site of the OsCPK18 N-terminus is required for plasma membrane targeting.

CONCLUSION: The rapid activation of OsCPK18 expression in response to AM inoculation, its expression being also induced by fungal-secreted signals, together with the observed plasma membrane localization of OsCPK18, points to a role for OsCPK18 in perception of the AM fungus. The OsCPK18 gene might be considered as a marker for the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process. These findings provide a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms operating during the AM symbiosis and will greatly facilitate their molecular dissection.
21621743	Introgression of qPE9-1 allele, conferring the panicle erectness, leads to the decrease of grain yield per plant in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	J Genet Genomics	Panicle architecture is closely related to yield formation. The qPE9-1 gene has been proved to be widely used in high-yield rice cultivar developments, conferring erect panicle character in japonica rice. Recently, qPE9-1 has been successfully cloned; however, the genetic effect on grain yield per plant of the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 is controversial yet. In the present study, a drooping panicle parent Nongken 57, carrying qpe9-1 allele, was used as recurrent parent to successively backcross to a typical erect panicle line from the double haploid (DH) population (Wuyunjing 8/Nongken 57), which was previously shown to carry qPE9-1 allele. Thus a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) was developed. The comparison of agronomic traits between the NILs showed that, when qpe9-1 was replaced by qPE9-1, the panicle architecture was changed from drooping to erect; moreover, the panicle length, plant height, 1000-grain weight and the tillers were significantly decreased, consequently resulting in the dramatic decrease of grain yield per plant by 30%. Therefore, we concluded that the qPE9-1 was a major factor controlling panicle architecture, and qPE9-1 had pleiotropic nature, with negative effects on grain yield per plant. This result strongly suggests that the erect panicle allele qPE9-1 should be used together with other favorable genes in the high-yield breeding practice. In addition, the effect of qPE9-1 on eating and cooking quality was also discussed in the present study.
21531900	DNA free energy-based promoter prediction and comparative analysis of Arabidopsis and rice genomes.	2011	Plant Physiol	The cis-regulatory regions on DNA serve as binding sites for proteins such as transcription factors and RNA polymerase. The combinatorial interaction of these proteins plays a crucial role in transcription initiation, which is an important point of control in the regulation of gene expression. We present here an analysis of the performance of an in silico method for predicting cis-regulatory regions in the plant genomes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) on the basis of free energy of DNA melting. For protein-coding genes, we achieve recall and precision of 96% and 42% for Arabidopsis and 97% and 31% for rice, respectively. For noncoding RNA genes, the program gives recall and precision of 94% and 75% for Arabidopsis and 95% and 90% for rice, respectively. Moreover, 96% of the false-positive predictions were located in noncoding regions of primary transcripts, out of which 20% were found in the first intron alone, indicating possible regulatory roles. The predictions for orthologous genes from the two genomes showed a good correlation with respect to prediction scores and promoter organization. Comparison of our results with an existing program for promoter prediction in plant genomes indicates that our method shows improved prediction capability.
20951807	Production of functional recombinant bovine trypsin in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures.	2011	Protein Expr Purif	A synthetic bovine trypsinogen (sbTrypsinogen) was synthesized on the basis of rice-optimized codon usage via an overlap PCR strategy, prior to being expressed under the control of the sucrose starvation-inducible rice α-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter. Secretion of trypsin into the culture medium was achieved by using the existing signal peptide. The plant expression vector was introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin), mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The integration of the sbTrypsinogen gene into the chromosome of the transgenic rice callus was verified via genomic DNA PCR amplification, and sbTrypsin expression in transgenic rice suspension cells was confirmed via Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis detected glycosylated proteins in the culture medium, having masses from 24 to 26 kDa, following induction by sugar starvation. Proteolytic activity of the rice-derived trypsin was confirmed by gelatin zymogram, and was similar to that of the commercial bovine-produced trypsin. The yields of sbTrypsin that accumulated in the transgenic rice cell suspension medium were 15 mg/L at 5 days after sugar starvation.
21530375	Ultra-sensitive determination of cadmium in rice and water by UV-vis spectrophotometry after single drop microextraction.	2011	Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc	In this work, a new method based on single drop microextraction (SDME) preconcentration using tetrachloromethane (CCl(4)) as extraction solvent was proposed for the spectrophotometric determination of cadmium in rice and water samples. The influence factors relevant to SDME, such as type and volume of extractant, stirring rate and time, dithizone concentration, pH, drop volume and instrumental conditions were studied systematically. Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.5 ng L(-1), with sensitivity enhancement factor (EF) of 128. The different maximum absorption wavelength caused by the different extraction acidity compared with some conventional works and the enhancement effect of acetone (dilution solvent) for the spectrophotometric determination were the two key factors of the high EF and sensitivity. The proposed method was applied to the determination of rice and water samples with satisfactory analytical results. The proposed method was simple, rapid, cost-efficient and sensitive.
21763543	Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 gene in Arabidopsis activates the expression of defense related genes and enhances resistance to pathogens.	2011	Plant Sci	The WRKY proteins are a major family of plant transcription factors implicated in the regulation of plant defense mechanisms against pathogens. OsWRKY6 was isolated based on expression profiling data carried out with samples infected by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). OsWRKY6 encodes a DNA binding protein that contains one WRKY domain, a nuclear localization signal and C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motif. OsWRKY6 is a member of the group II family of WRKY proteins. Based on the result of yeast one hybrid assay this OsWRKY6 protein binds to the typical W box ((T)TGACC/T). OsWRKY6 functions as a transcriptional activator in yeast. OsWRKY6 enhanced the expression of the reporter gene downstream of OsPR1 promoter, indicating that OsWRKY6 is a transcriptional activator in rice as well. Heterologous expression of OsWRKY6 enhanced disease resistance to pathogen. Defense-related genes were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY6. All together, OsWRKY6 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of the plant defense response.
21281270	Cold sensitivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is strongly correlated with a naturally occurring I99V mutation in the multifunctional glutathione transferase isoenzyme GSTZ2.	2011	Biochem J	GSTZs [Zeta class GSTs (glutathione transferases)] are multifunctional enzymes that belong to a highly conserved subfamily of soluble GSTs found in species ranging from fungi and plants to animals. GSTZs are known to function as MAAIs [MAA (maleylacetoacetate) isomerases], which play a role in tyrosine catabolism by catalysing the isomerization of MAA to FAA (fumarylacetoacetate). As tyrosine metabolism in plants differs from animals, the significance of GSTZ/MAAI is unclear. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a major QTL (quantitative trait locus) for seedling cold tolerance has been fine mapped to a region containing the genes OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2. Sequencing of tolerant (ssp. japonica cv. M-202) and sensitive (ssp. indica cv. IR50) cultivars revealed two SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in OsGSTZ2 that result in amino acid differences (I99V and N184I). Recombinant OsGSTZ2 containing the Val99 residue found in IR50 had significantly reduced activity on MAA and DCA (dichloroacetic acid), but the Ile184 residue had no effect. The distribution of the SNP (c.295A>G) among various rice accessions indicates a significant association with chilling sensitivity in rice seedlings. The results of the present study show that naturally occurring OsGSTZ2 isoforms differ in their enzymatic properties, which may contribute to the differential response to chilling stress generally exhibited by the two major rice subspecies.
21575196	PRIN: a predicted rice interactome network.	2011	BMC Bioinformatics	BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interactions play a fundamental role in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of biomolecular function, signal transductions and metabolic pathways of living organisms. Although high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid system and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry are widely used in model organisms, the progress of protein-protein interactions detection in plants is rather slow. With this motivation, our work presents a computational approach to predict protein-protein interactions in Oryza sativa.

RESULTS: To better understand the interactions of proteins in Oryza sativa, we have developed PRIN, a Predicted Rice Interactome Network. Protein-protein interaction data of PRIN are based on the interologs of six model organisms where large-scale protein-protein interaction experiments have been applied: yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), human (Homo sapiens), Escherichia coli K12 and Arabidopsis thaliana. With certain quality controls, altogether we obtained 76,585 non-redundant rice protein interaction pairs among 5,049 rice proteins. Further analysis showed that the topology properties of predicted rice protein interaction network are more similar to yeast than to the other 5 organisms. This may not be surprising as the interologs based on yeast contribute nearly 74% of total interactions. In addition, GO annotation, subcellular localization information and gene expression data are also mapped to our network for validation. Finally, a user-friendly web interface was developed to offer convenient database search and network visualization.

CONCLUSIONS: PRIN is the first well annotated protein interaction database for the important model plant Oryza sativa. It has greatly extended the current available protein-protein interaction data of rice with a computational approach, which will certainly provide further insights into rice functional genomics and systems biology. PRIN is available online at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/prin/.
21491156	Calcium is involved in nitric oxide- and auxin-induced lateral root formation in rice.	2012	Protoplasma	In the present study, the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of lateral root (LR) formation in rice was examined. Application of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; a NO donor) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA; a naturally occurring auxin) to rice seedlings induced LR formation. The effect is specific for NO because the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3- oxide (cPTIO) blocked the action of SNP and IBA. Endogenous NO was detected by the specific fluorescence probe 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate. SNP- and IBA-induced NO fluorescence was specifically suppressed by cPTIO. Nitrate reductase (NR) inhibitor sodium tungstate completely inhibited IBA-induced LR formation and NO fluorescence. However, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N (G)-nitro-L: -arginine methyl ester hydrochloride slightly reduced IBA-induced LR formation and NO generation. It appears that NO generation that occurs in response to IBA might primarily involve NR activity. Moreover, NO production caused by SNP and IBA was localized in root area corresponding to LR emergence. The effects of Ca(2+) chelators, Ca(2+)-channel inhibitors, and calmodulin antagonists on LR formation induced by SNP and IBA were also examined. All these inhibitors were effective in reducing the action of SNP and IBA. However, Ca(2+) chelators and Ca(2+)-channel inhibitors had no effect on SNP- and IBA-induced NO generation. It is concluded that cytosolic levels of Ca(2+) may regulate SNP and IBA action through calmodulin-dependent mechanism.
21482531	[A new rice dwarf1 mutant caused by a frame-shift mutation].	2011	Yi Chuan	A dwarf mutant C6PS, which has the similar phenotype as the recessive mutant Dwarf1 (d1), was produced from tissue-cultured plants of Zhonghua 11. In its progeny (T2), the ratio of tall to dwarf plants was in agreement with the expected segregation ratio (3:1) of a single Mendelian inheritance gene, which indicated that the variation of plant height is caused by a single gene. To locate the mutation, C6PS was crossed with Zhenshan 97 and Mudanjiang 8 for producing two F2 populations of F2 (CM) and F2 (CZ), respectively. The plant height in each F2 population also showed the same segregation pattern as that in T2 generation. SSR marker RM430 closely linked to Dwarf1 was preferentially used to genotype the F2 (CZ) population because C6PS showed the similar phenotype to d1 mutant. RM430 was significantly associated with plant height, which indicated that the mutant gene might be D1. Comparative sequencing of D1 between C6PS and Zhonghua 11 showed a 6 bp deletion occurred in the splice site of its ninth exon. The marker C6PS-D1L/R designed on the 6 bp deletion was co-segregated with plant height in T2 generation. The results indicated that C6PS was a new mutant of D1. This mutation led to a 26 bp deletion of the transcript and resulted in a frame-shift mutation and a premature stop codon in C6PS, which could not translate the functional Gα protein. C6PS was weakly sensitive to Brassinolide based on the leaf inclination angle test.
21113680	Transcriptional profiling and in silico analysis of Dof transcription factor gene family for understanding their regulation during seed development of rice Oryza sativa L.	2011	Mol Biol Rep	Seed development is a complex process controlled by temporal and spatial expression of many transcription factors (TF) inside the developing seed. In the present study, transcript profiles of all the 30 members of rice DofTFs from flowering to seed development stages were analyzed. It was found that 16 Dof genes besides a previously characterized Dof gene 'RPBF' are differentially expressed during the seed development and unlike RPBF are not seed specific. Based on the expression patterns, these rice DofTFs were categorized into four groups-6 genes were constitutive while 4 genes were up-regulated and 3 genes were down regulated and four genes were maximally expressed at specific stages of seed development viz. one gene at flowering, two genes at watery ripe and one gene at milky stage. The involvement of more than one gene at different stages of seed development is suggestive of combinatorial regulation of their downstream genes involved in seed development. In silico expression analysis of wheat and Arabidopsis Dof Tfs also revealed that more than 50% of the Dof genes are expressed during the seed development process. Further in silico study of regulatory elements present in the promoters of these genes revealed the presence of some unique and common motifs in the promoters of rice and wheat Dof genes which indicate that Dof genes are possibly involved in ethylene and jasmonate signaling pathways affecting grain filling and grain quality. These Dof genes containing ethylene responsive motifs in their promoter region could possibly be the targets of recently identified Sub1 gene which codes for a ethylene responsive factor.
21726383	p2 of rice stripe virus (RSV) interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor.	2011	Mol Plant Pathol	A rice cDNA library was screened by a galactosidase 4 (Gal4)-based yeast two-hybrid system with Rice stripe virus (RSV) p2 as bait. The results revealed that RSV p2 interacted with a rice protein exhibiting a high degree of identity with Arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of gene silencing 3 (AtSGS3). The interaction was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. SGS3 has been shown to be involved in sense transgene-induced RNA silencing and in the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), possibly functioning as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6). Given the intimate relationships between virus and RNA silencing, further experiments were conducted to show that p2 was a silencing suppressor. In addition, p2 enhanced the accumulation and pathogenicity of Potato virus X in Nicotiana benthamiana. Five genes that have been demonstrated to be targets of TAS3-derived ta-siRNAs were up-regulated in RSV-infected rice. The implications of these findings are discussed.
21533902	Production of transgenic rice new germplasm with strong resistance against two isolations of Rice stripe virus by RNA interference.	2011	Transgenic Res	Rice stripe disease, with the pathogen Rice stripe virus (RSV), is one of the most widespread and severe virus diseases. Cultivating a resistant breed is an essential and efficient method in preventing rice stripe disease. Following RNA interference (RNAi) theory, we constructed three RNAi binary vectors based on coat protein (CP), special-disease protein (SP) and chimeric CP/SP gene sequence. Transgenic lines of rice cv. Yujing6 were generated through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We inoculated T1 generation plants from each line derived from CP/SP, CP, and SP transgenic rice plants with two RSV isolates from Shandong Province and Jiangsu Province using viruliferous vector insects. In these resistance assays, chimeric CP/SP RNAi lines showed stronger resistance against two isolates than CP or SP single RNAi lines. Stable integration and expression of RNAi transgenes were confirmed by Southern and northern blot analysis of independent transgenic lines. In the resistant transgenic lines, lower levels of transgene transcripts and specific short interference RNAs were observed relative to the susceptible transgenic plant, which showed that virus resistance was increased by RNAi. Genetic analysis demonstrated that transgene and virus resistance was stably inherited in the T2 progeny plants.
21595523	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch.	2011	Genome	Soluble starch synthases (SSs) are major enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in developing rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm. Despite extensive studies of SSs in various plant species including rice, the functional modes of action among multiple SS genes are still not clear. Here, we generated transgenic RNA interference (RNAi) repressed lines for seven of the eight members of the rice SS gene family and studied their effects on starch synthesis and grain formation. Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes. To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities. The double mutation also reduced short (degree of polymerization (DP) 5-6) and long (DP 12-23) amylopectin chain contents in the grain and increased the medium long types (DP 7-11). The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that SSIIa and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis. Such interaction may be physical via starch phophorylase as indicated by our pair-wise yeast two-hybrid assays on major starch synthesis enzymes. Collectively, the data showed that SSIIa and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis. The possibility of extensive redundancy or complementarity among SS isozymes is discussed.
21678052	Understanding the differential nitrogen sensing mechanism in rice genotypes through expression analysis of high and low affinity ammonium transporter genes.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Two rice genotypes, Kalanamak 3119 (KN3119) and Pusa Basmati 1(PB1) differing in their optimum nitrogen requirements (30 and 120 kg/ha, respectively) were undertaken to study the expression of both high and low affinity ammonium transporter genes responsible for ammonium uptake. Exposing the roots of the seedlings of both the genotypes to increasing (NH(4))(2)SO(4) concentrations revealed that all the three families of rice AMT genes are expressed, some of which get altered in a genotype and concentration specific manner. This indicates that individual ammonium transporter genes have defined contributions for ammonium uptake and plant growth. Interestingly, in response to increasing nitrogen concentrations, a root specific high affinity gene, AMT1;3, was repressed in the roots of KN3119 but not in PB1 indicating the existence of a differential ammonium sensing mechanism. This also indicates that not only AMT1;3 is involved not only in ammonium uptake but may also in ammonium sensing. Further, if it can differentiate and could be used as a biomarker for nitrogen responsiveness. Expression analysis of low affinity AMT genes showed that, both AMT2;1 and AMT2;2 have high levels of expression in both roots and shoots and in KN3119 are induced at low ammonium concentrations. Expressions of AMT3 family genes were higher shoots than in the roots indicating that these genes are probably involved in the translocation and distribution of ammonium ions in leaves. The expression of the only high affinity AMT gene, AMT1;1, along with six low affinity AMT genes in the shoots suggests that low affinity AMTs in the shoots leaves are involved in supporting AMT1;1 to carry out its activities/function efficiently.
21360198	Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with rice eating quality traits using a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two temperate japonica cultivars.	2011	Mol Cells	Improved eating quality is a major breeding target in japonica rice due to market demand. In this study, we performed genetic analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control rice eating quality traits using 192 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two japonica cultivars, 'Suweon365' and 'Chucheongbyeo'. We evaluated the stickiness (ST) and overall evaluation (OE) of cooked rice using a sensory test, the glossiness of cooked rice (GCR) using a Toyo-taste meter, and measured the amylose content (AC), protein content (PC), alkali digestion value (ADV), and days to heading (DH) of the RILs in the years 2006 and 2007. Our analysis revealed 21 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11. QTLs on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 were detected for three traits related to eating quality in both years. QTLs for ST and OE were identified by a sensory test in the same region of the QTLs for AC, PC, ADV, GCR and DH on chromosome 8. QTL effects on the GCR were verified using QTL-NILs (near-isogenic lines) of BC(3)F(4-6) in the Suweon365 background, a low eating quality variety, and some BC(1)F(3) lines. Chucheongbyeo alleles at QTLs on chromosomes 7 and 8 increased the GCR in the NILs and backcrossed lines. The QTLs identified by our analysis will be applicable to future marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies for improving the eating quality of japonica rice.
21696979	Impact of UV-B irradiation on photosynthetic performance and chloroplast membrane components in Oryza sativa L.	2011	J Photochem Photobiol B	The impact of UV-B radiation on photosynthetic related parameters was studied in Oryza sativa L. cv. Safari plants, after an UV-B irradiation performed 1h per day for 7days (between 8 and 14days after germination) with a ten narrow-band (λ 311nm) that resulted in a total biological effective UV-B (UVB(BE)) of 2.975kJm(-2)day(-1) and a total of 20.825kJm(-2). Gas exchange measurements were severely affected, showing reductions higher than 80% in net photosynthesis (P(n)), stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), 1day after the end of the 7-days UV-B treatment. Similarly, several fluorescence parameters (F(o), F(v)/F(m), Fv'/Fm', ϕ(e), q(P) and q(E)) and thylakoid electron transport (involving both photosystems) were also severely reduced. Concomitantly, a decline of xanthophylls, carotenes, Chl a, Chl (a+b) and Chl (a/b) values was accompanied by the increase of the lipoperoxidation level in chloroplast membranes, altogether reflecting a loss of protection against oxidative stress. Seven days after of the end of UV-B treatment, most fluorescence parameters recovered, but in P(n), A(max), thylakoid electron transport rates, Chl a and lipid classes, as well as the level of lipoperoxidation, the impacts were even stronger than immediately after the end of stress, denoting a clear loss of performance of photosynthetic structures. However, only a moderate impact on total lipids was observed, accompanied by some changes in the relative weight of the major chloroplast membrane lipid classes, with emphasis on the decrease of MGDG and the increase of phospholipids. That suggested an ability to de novo lipid synthesis allowing qualitative changes in the lipid matrix. Notably, the leaves developed after the end of UV-B irradiation showed a much lower impact, with significantly decreased values only in P(n) and g(s), rises in several fluorescence parameters, thylakoid electron transport, photosynthetic pigments (xanthophylls and chls) and DEPS, while lipid classes presented values close to control. The results showed a global impact of UV-B in the photosynthetic structures and performance in irradiated leaves, but revealed also a low impairment extent in the leaves entirely developed after the end of the irradiation, reflecting a remarkable recovery of the plant after the end of stress, what could constitute an advantage under occasional UV-B exposure events in this vital worldwide staple food crop.
21562821	A single nucleotide polymorphism in the Waxy gene explains a significant component of gel consistency.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Gel consistency (GC) is a standard assay used in rice improvement programmes to determine whether rice cultivars/breeding lines of high amylose content are soft or firm textured when cooked. In this study, we show that sequence variation in exon 10 of the Waxy (Wx) gene associates with GC using RILs derived from parents with high amylose content that differ in GC. The association was validated using a diverse set of traditional varieties, selected on the basis of amylose content, from the generation challenge programme. Structural investigations to explain how the mutation leads to differences in GC showed a strong association between GC and the proportion of amylose that leaches. It was shown that cooked rices of hard GC do not change in hardness over 24 h, whereas rices of soft GC retrograde significantly over 24 h. This leads to the conclusion that the mutation on exon 10 of the Wx gene affects the proportion of amylose bound to amylopectin and the proportion able to leach, and these structural differences alter the composition of the gel, which affects the amount of time the gel takes to reach a final hardness. The SNP described here completes the set of markers required to genotype for the current traits of cooking quality, but selecting the allele for soft texture has the negative result of also selecting for retrogradation potential.
21688166	Bt rice expressing Cry1Ab does not stimulate an outbreak of its non-target herbivore, Nilaparvata lugens.	2012	Transgenic Res	In this study, the non-target effects of Bt rice "KMD2" expressing a Cry1Ab protein on the performance of the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, over multiple generations were evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory, BPH was reared to observe the impact of the Bt rice as compared to its parental non-Bt cultivar Xiushui 11, while the population dynamics and oviposition performance of BPH were investigated in the field. The survival of BPH nymphs fed Bt and non-Bt rice did not differ significantly. The nymph developmental duration of BPH was significantly delayed by the Bt rice by comparison with the non-Bt rice for the 1st and 2nd but not the 4th generation. Most importantly, the fecundity of BPH on the Bt rice was significantly decreased in every generation when compared with the non-Bt rice. In the field investigations, the population density of BPH nymphs was significantly lower in the Bt rice field. However, the temporal pattern of population dynamics of BPH adults was similar between the Bt and non-Bt rice, presumably due to migratory interference of the adults. In the Bt rice field, the percentage of tillers with eggs and the number of eggs per tiller were also significantly lower from tillering to mature stage. Additionally, Cry1Ab protein could not be detected in guts from single BPH adults. In general, our results suggest that the Bt rice "KMD2" could not stimulate an outbreak of BPH.
21489969	Distinct mechanisms for aerenchyma formation in leaf sheaths of rice genotypes displaying a quiescence or escape strategy for flooding tolerance.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rice is one of the few crops able to withstand periods of partial or even complete submergence. One of the adaptive traits of rice is the constitutive presence and further development of aerenchyma which enables oxygen to be transported to submerged organs. The development of lysigenous aerenchyma is promoted by ethylene accumulating within the submerged plant tissues, although other signalling mechanisms may also co-exist. In this study, aerenchyma development was analysed in two rice (Oryza sativa) varieties, 'FR13A' and 'Arborio Precoce', which show opposite traits in flooding response in terms of internode elongation and survival.

METHODS: The growth and survival of rice varieties under submergence was investigated in the leaf sheath of 'FR13A' and 'Arborio Precoce'. The possible involvement of ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated in relation to aerenchyma formation. Cell viability and DNA fragmentation were determined by FDA/FM4-64 staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. Ethylene production was monitored by gas chromatography and by analysing ACO gene expression. ROS production was measured by using Amplex Red assay kit and the fluorescent dye DCFH(2)-DA. The expression of APX1 was also evaluated. AVG and DPI solutions were used to test the effect of inhibiting ethylene biosynthesis and ROS production, respectively.

KEY RESULTS: Both the varieties displayed constitutive lysigenous aerenchyma formation, which was further enhanced when submerged. 'Arborio Precoce', which is characterized by fast elongation when submerged, showed active ethylene biosynthetic machinery associated with increased aerenchymatous areas. 'FR13A', which harbours the Sub1A gene that limits growth during oxygen deprivation, did not show any increase in ethylene production after submersion but still displayed increased aerenchyma. Hydrogen peroxide levels increased in 'FR13A' but not in 'Arborio Precoce'.

CONCLUSIONS: While ethylene controls aerenchyma formation in the fast-elongating 'Arborio Precoce' variety, in 'FR13A' ROS accumulation plays an important role.
21385389	Diversity and selective sweep in the OsAMT1;1 genomic region of rice.	2011	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth. OsAMT1;1 is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L.), responsible for ammonium uptake at low nitrogen concentration. The expression pattern of the gene has been reported. However, variations in its nucleotides and the evolutionary pathway of its descent from wild progenitors are yet to be elucidated. In this study, nucleotide diversity of the gene OsAMT1;1 and the diversity pattern of seven gene fragments spanning a genomic region approximately 150 kb long surrounding the gene were surveyed by sequencing a panel of 216 rice accessions including both cultivated rice and wild relatives.

RESULTS: Nucleotide polymorphism (Pi) of OsAMT1;1 was as low as 0.00004 in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), only 2.3% of that in the common wild rice (O. rufipogon). A single dominant haplotype was fixed at the locus in O. sativa. The test values for neutrality were significantly negative in the entire region stretching 5' upstream and 3' downstream of the gene in all accessions. The value of linkage disequilibrium remained high across a 100 kb genomic region around OsAMT1;1 in O. sativa, but fell rapidly in O. rufipogon on either side of the promoter of OsAMT1;1, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter.

CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. Purifying selection also occurred before the wild rice diverged into its two subspecies, namely indica and japonica. These findings would provide useful insights into the processes of evolution and domestication of nitrogen uptake genes in rice.
21421424	Response to photoxidative stress induced by cold in japonica rice is genotype dependent.	2011	Plant Sci	Two japonica rice genotypes, INIA Tacuarí and L2825CA, were analyzed for tolerance to low temperature during early vegetative growth. Effect on photosynthesis, energy dissipation, pigment content, xanthophyll-cycle pool conversion, hydrogen peroxide accumulation, oxidative damage and antioxidant enzyme activities were determined to better understand potential mechanisms for cold tolerance. Photoinhibition was measured using chlorophyll fluorescence and oxidative damage by lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage. Both genotypes were demonstrated to be cold tolerant which was consistent with their reduced levels of photoinhibition and oxidative damage compared with a cold-sensitive genotype during chilling stress. The strategy for cold tolerance differed between the two genotypes, and involved different mechanisms for disposal of excess energy. The presence of high lutein concentrations and the existence of active non-harmful energy dissipation processes through the xanthophyll cycle appeared to be responsible for chilling tolerance in INIA Tacuarí. On the other hand, increased cold tolerance of L2825CA relative to INIA Tacuarí was related to the higher constitutive superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6).
21684871	[Chromosome recombination in rice meiosis].	2011	Yi Chuan	Meiosis is a highly conservative process, which plays important role in the life cycles of all sexually reproductive organisms, while the pairing, synapsis, and recombination are the key events in this process and have become the hotspots in meiosis studies. At present, we cannot observe the process of cross and recombination of chromosomes directly in plant meiosis, and generally conclude the process by analysis the genetic population. In the present study, we analyzed 32 DH lines using graphical genotypes, and found 4 chromosomes out of 32 DH lines had regional heterozygosis, which was further confirmed using STS markers. We suggested that it may cause by repair incompletion or mis-repair of chromsome. These results provid some directly evidence for explaining the mechanism of plant meiosis.
21414017	Stagnant deoxygenated growth enhances root suberization and lignifications, but differentially affects water and NaCl permeabilities in rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	It has been shown that rice roots grown in a stagnant medium develop a tight barrier to radial oxygen loss (ROL), whereas aerated roots do not. This study investigated whether the induction of a barrier to ROL affects water and solute permeabilities. Growth in stagnant medium markedly reduced the root growth rate relative to aerated conditions. Histochemical studies revealed an early deposition of Casparian bands (CBs) and suberin lamellae (SL) in both the endodermis (EN) and exodermis, and accelerated lignification of stagnant roots. The absolute amounts of suberin, lignin and esterified aromatics (coumaric and ferulic acid) in these barriers were significantly higher in stagnant roots. However, correlative permeability studies revealed that early deposition of barriers in stagnant roots failed to reduce hydraulic conductivity (Lp(r) ) below those of aerated roots. In contrast to Lp(r) , the NaCl permeability (P(sr) ) of stagnant roots was markedly lower than that of aerated roots, as indicated by an increased reflection coefficient (σ(sr) ). In stagnant roots, P(sr) decreased by 60%, while σ(sr) increased by 55%. The stagnant medium differentially affected the Lp(r) and P(sr) of roots, which can be explained in terms of the physical properties of the molecules used and the size of the pores in the apoplast.
21533176	Towards establishment of a rice stress response interactome.	2011	PLoS Genet	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple food for more than half the world and a model for studies of monocotyledonous species, which include cereal crops and candidate bioenergy grasses. A major limitation of crop production is imposed by a suite of abiotic and biotic stresses resulting in 30%-60% yield losses globally each year. To elucidate stress response signaling networks, we constructed an interactome of 100 proteins by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays around key regulators of the rice biotic and abiotic stress responses. We validated the interactome using protein-protein interaction (PPI) assays, co-expression of transcripts, and phenotypic analyses. Using this interactome-guided prediction and phenotype validation, we identified ten novel regulators of stress tolerance, including two from protein classes not previously known to function in stress responses. Several lines of evidence support cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress responses. The combination of focused interactome and systems analyses described here represents significant progress toward elucidating the molecular basis of traits of agronomic importance.
21296585	A stress-associated protein containing A20/AN1 zing-finger domains expressed in Medicago truncatula seeds.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	MtSAP1 (Medicago truncatula stress-associated protein 1) was revealed as a down-regulated gene by suppressive subtractive hybridization between two mRNA populations of embryo axes harvested before and after radicle emergence. MtSAP1 is the first gene encoding a SAP with A20 and AN1 zinc-finger domains characterized in M. truncatula. MtSAP1 protein shares 54% and 62% homology with AtSAP7 (Arabidopsis thaliana) and OsiSAP8 (Oryza sativa) respectively, with in particular a strong homology in the A20 and AN1 conserved domains. MtSAP1 gene expression increased in the embryos during the acquisition of tolerance to desiccation, reached its maximum in dry seed and decreased dramatically during the first hours of imbibition. Abiotic stresses (cold and hypoxia), abscisic acid and desiccation treatments induced MtSAP1 gene expression and protein accumulation in embryo axis, while mild drought stress did not affect significantly its expression. This profile of expression along with the presence of anaerobic response elements and ABRE sequences in the upstream region of the gene is consistent with a role of MtSAP1 in the tolerance of low oxygen availability and desiccation during late stages of seed maturation. Silencing of MtSAP1 by RNA interference (RNAi) showed that the function of the encoded protein is required for adequate accumulation of storage globulin proteins, vicilin and legumin, and for the development of embryos able to achieve successful germination.
21493662	Crystal structure of the branching enzyme I (BEI) from Oryza sativa L with implications for catalysis and substrate binding.	2011	Glycobiology	Starch-branching enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of α-1, 4-linkages and the subsequent transfer of α-1,4 glucan to form an α-1,6 branch point in amylopectin. Sequence analysis of the rice-branching enzyme I (BEI) indicated a modular structure in which the central α-amylase domain is flanked on each side by the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module 48 and the α-amylase C-domain. We determined the crystal structure of BEI at a resolution of 1.9 Å by molecular replacement using the Escherichia coli glycogen BE as a search model. Despite three modular structures, BEI is roughly ellipsoidal in shape with two globular domains that form a prominent groove which is proposed to serve as the α-polyglucan-binding site. Amino acid residues Asp344 and Glu399, which are postulated to play an essential role in catalysis as a nucleophile and a general acid/base, respectively, are located at a central cleft in the groove. Moreover, structural comparison revealed that in BEI, extended loop structures cause a narrowing of the substrate-binding site, whereas shortened loop structures make a larger space at the corresponding subsite in the Klebsiella pneumoniae pullulanase. This structural difference might be attributed to distinct catalytic reactions, transglycosylation and hydrolysis, respectively, by BEI and pullulanase.
21468744	Comparative genetic analysis of a wheat seed dormancy QTL with rice and Brachypodium identifies candidate genes for ABA perception and calcium signaling.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Wheat preharvest sprouting (PHS) occurs when seed germinates on the plant before harvest resulting in reduced grain quality. In wheat, PHS susceptibility is correlated with low levels of seed dormancy. A previous mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) revealed a major PHS/seed dormancy QTL, QPhs.cnl-2B.1, located on wheat chromosome 2B. A comparative genetic study with the related grass species rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon at the homologous region to the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval was used to identify the candidate genes for marker development and subsequent fine mapping. Expressed sequence tags and a comparative mapping were used to design 278 primer pairs, of which 22 produced polymorphic amplicons that mapped to the group 2 chromosomes. Fourteen mapped to chromosome 2B, and ten were located in the QTL interval. A comparative analysis revealed good macrocollinearity between the PHS interval and 3 million base pair (mb) region on rice chromosomes 7 and 3, and a 2.7-mb region on Brachypodium Bd1. The comparative intervals in rice were found to contain three previously identified rice seed dormancy QTL. Further analyses of the interval in rice identified genes that are known to play a role in seed dormancy, including a homologue for the putative Arabidopsis ABA receptor ABAR/GUN5. Additional candidate genes involved in calcium signaling were identified and were placed in a functional protein association network that includes additional proteins critical for ABA signaling and germination. This study provides promising candidate genes for seed dormancy in both wheat and rice as well as excellent molecular markers for further comparative and fine mapping.
21553108	Nitric oxide enhances aluminum tolerance by affecting cell wall polysaccharides in rice roots.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signal molecule involved in many physiological processes in plants. To study the mechanisms of exogenous NO contribution to alleviate the aluminum (Al) toxicity, roots of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings pre-treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) were used to investigate the effect of Al in this study. Results indicated that NO alleviated the lipid peroxidation induced by Al and promoted the root elongation, whereas butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), an efficient lipophilic antioxidant, alleviated the lipid peroxidation only. Rice seedling roots pre-treated with SNP followed by Al treatment had lower contents of pectin and hemicellulose, lower Al accumulation in root tips and cell walls, higher degree of methylation of pectin and lower wall Al-binding capacity than the roots with Al treatment only. Therefore, the decreased Al accumulation in the cell walls of rice roots is likely to be the reason for the NO-induced increase of Al tolerance in rice, and it seems that exogenous NO enhanced Al tolerance in rice roots by decreasing the contents of pectin and hemicellulose, increasing the degree of methylation of pectin, and decreasing Al accumulation in root cell walls.
21549224	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15.	2011	N Biotechnol	In plants, flowering as a crucial developmental event is highly regulated by both genetic programs and environmental signals. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flowering induction. In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654. The OsLF gene encodes an atypical HLH protein composed of 419 amino acids (aa). Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering. Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant. Yeast two hybrid and colocalization assays revealed that OsLF interacts strongly with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 that are potentially involved in light signaling. In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
21451255	Overexpression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene OsMAPK33 enhances sensitivity to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	J Biosci	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling cascades are activated by extracellular stimuli such as environmental stresses and pathogens in higher eukaryotic plants. To know more about MAPK signalling in plants, aMAPK cDNA clone, OsMAPK33, was isolated from rice. The gene is mainly induced by drought stress. In phylogenetic analysis, OsMAPK33 (Os02g0148100) showed approximately 47-93% identity at the amino acid level with other plant MAPKs. It was found to exhibit organ-specific expression with relatively higher expression in leaves as compared with roots or stems, and to exist as a single copy in the rice genome. To investigate the biological functions of OsMAPK33 in rice MAPK signalling, transgenic rice plants that either overexpressed or suppressed OsMAPK33 were made. Under dehydration conditions, the suppressed lines showed lower osmotic potential compared with that of wild-type plants, suggesting a role of OsMAPK33 in osmotic homeostasis. Nonetheless, the suppressed lines did not display any significant difference in drought tolerance compared with their wild-type plants. With increased salinity, there was still no difference in salt tolerance between OsMAPK33-suppressed lines and their wild-type plants. However, the overexpressing lines showed greater reduction in biomass accumulation and higher sodium uptake into cells, resulting in a lower K+/Na+ ratio inside the cell than that in the wild-type plants and OsMAPK33-suppressed lines. These results suggest that OsMAPK33 could play a negative role in salt tolerance through unfavourable ion homeostasis. Gene expression profiling of OsMAPK33 transgenic lines through rice DNA chip analysis showed that OsMAPK33 altered expression of genes involved in ion transport. Further characterization of downstream components will elucidate various biological functions of this novel rice MAPK.
21486304	Rice OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a nitrate transporters to provide uptake over high and low concentration ranges.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Plants take up both nitrate and ammonium as main nitrogen (N) sources. Although ammonium is the predominant form in anaerobic-flooded paddy soil, it has been proposed that rice and other wetland plants may take up significant amounts of nitrate formed by nitrification of ammonium in the rhizosphere. A two-component system for nitrate transport including NRT2s with a partner protein (NAR2 or NRT3.1) has been identified in Arabidopsis. We report the physiological function of another member of the NAR2 family, OsNAR2.1 in rice (Oryza sativa, ssp. Japonica, cv. Nipponbare). OsNAR2.1 was mainly expressed in roots and induced by nitrate and suppressed by ammonium and some amino acids. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 by RNA interference synchronously suppressed expression of OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a in the osnar2.1mutants. Both high- and low-affinity nitrate transports were greatly impaired by OsNAR2.1 knockdown. Yeast two hybridization showed that OsNAR2.1 not only interacted with OsNRT2.1/OsNRT2.2, but also with OsNRT2.3a. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNAR2.1 plays a key role in enabling the plant to cope with variable nitrate supply.
21731454	Enhancement of salinity tolerance during rice seed germination by presoaking with hemoglobin.	2011	Int J Mol Sci	Salinity stress is an important environmental constraint limiting the productivity of many crops worldwide. In this report, experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of seed presoaking by bovine hemoglobin, an inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), on salinity tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The results showed that different concentrations of the hemoglobin (0.01, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 g/L) differentially alleviated the inhibition of rice seed germination and thereafter seedling shoot growth caused by 100 mM NaCl stress, and the responses of 1.0 g/L hemoglobin was the most obvious. Further analyses showed that application of hemoglobin not only increased the HO-1 gene expression, but also differentially induced catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities or transcripts, thus decreasing the lipid peroxidation in germinating rice seeds subjected to salt stress. Compared with non-hemoglobin treatment, hemoglobin presoaking also increased the potassium (K) to sodium (Na) ratio both in the root and shoot parts after salinity stress. The effect is specific for HO-1 since the potent HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) blocked the positive actions of hemoglobin on seed germination and seedling shoot growth. Overall, these results suggested that hemoglobin performs an advantageous role in enhancement of salinity tolerance during rice seed germination.
21633891	Functional analysis of the HS185 regulatory element in the rice HSP70 promoter.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	A series of HSP70 promoter deletion constructs was established. Analysis of beta-glucuronidase activities from the promoter deletion constructs in transient expression assays identified a cis-element, located from -493 to -308 bp upstream of the ATG start site. This element was designated as HS185 and has a crucial role in HSP70 promoter activity. HS185 has some characteristics of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE), such as terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (GGTCCCACA) and a putative target site duplication. There are 362 copies of homologous sequences of HS185 in the rice genome, which are preferentially distributed to non-coding regions. Based on these sequence features, we propose that HS185 is an uncharacterized rice MITE, possibly derived from the rice transposon Mutator-like element VIII family. Further transient expression assays showed that HS185 inhibited the enhancer activity of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. These results demonstrate that not only is HS185 necessary for HSP70 promoter activity, but it also has a functional role as an insulator. This study explored new regulatory functions of non-coding repeat sequences in rice.
21509472	Microsatellite analysis of homozygosity progression of heterozygous genotypes segregating in the rice subspecies cross Pei'ai64s/Nipponbare.	2011	Biochem Genet	Progression to homozygosity of heterozygous genotypes was studied in a cross of the rice subspecies Pei'ai64s and Nipponbare, using a set of 157 polymorphic microsatellite (SSR) markers. The segregation of heterozygous genotypes ranged from 49.13% in the F(2) population to 4.52% in the F(6) population (progression value 11.15%). The heterozygous genotypes were widely distributed in 180 F(2) plants, 330 F(6) lines, and 157 SSR markers. Homozygosity progression showed a wide distribution in plants and SSR markers but not in chromosomes. The segregation of heterozygous genotypes was not significant between populations but varied greatly in F(2) plants, F(6) lines, and SSR markers. The correlation between the progression to homozygosity and the heterozygosity of SSR markers was significant at the chromosome level. The segregation of heterozygous genotypes in plants, SSR markers, and chromosomes was not completely in accordance with Mendel's law. This information will help rice geneticists and breeders to understand heterozygous genotype segregation at the DNA level and to screen special markers for breeding.
21534978	Genome-wide transcriptional changes and defence-related chemical profiling of rice in response to infestation by the rice striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis.	2011	Physiol Plant	How rice defends itself against pathogen infection is well documented, but little is known about how it defends itself against herbivore attack. We measured changes in the transcriptome and chemical profile of rice when the plant is infested by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis. Infestation by SSBs resulted in changes in the expression levels of 4545 rice genes; this number accounts for about 8% of the genome and is made up of 18 functional groups with broad functions. The largest group comprised genes involved in metabolism, followed by cellular transport, transcription and cellular signaling. Infestation by SSBs modulated many genes responsible for the biosynthesis of plant hormones and plant signaling. Jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene were the major hormones that shaped the SSB-induced defence responses of rice. Many secondary signal transduction components, such as those involved in Ca²⁺ signaling and G-protein signaling, receptor and non-receptor protein kinases, and transcription factors were involved in the SSB-induced responses of rice. Photosynthesis and ATP synthesis from photophosphorylation were restricted by SSB feeding. In addition, SSB infestation induced the accumulation of defence compounds, including trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPIs) and volatile organic compounds. These results demonstrate that SSB-induced defences required rice to reconfigure a wide variety of its metabolic, physiological and biochemical processes.
21741836	New branching inhibitors and their potential as strigolactone mimics in rice.	2011	Bioorg Med Chem Lett	Strigolactones (SLs) are rhizosphere communication chemicals. Recent studies of highly branched mutants revealed that SL or its metabolites work as a phytohormone to inhibit shoot branching. When SLs are exogenously applied to the rice d10-1 mutant that has a highly branched phenotype caused by a defect in the SL biosynthesis gene (CCD8), they inhibit tiller bud outgrowth (branching in rice) of the mutant. We focused our attention on the SL function as a phytohormone and tried to find new chemicals mimicking the hormonal action of SL by screening chemicals that inhibit branching of rice d10-1 mutant. Fortunately, we found 5-(4-chlorophenoxy)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (3a) as a new chemical possessing SL-like activity against the rice d10-1 mutant. Then, we prepared several derivatives of 3a (3b-3k) to examine their ability to inhibit shoot branching of rice d10-1. These derivatives were synthesized by a one-pot coupling reaction between phenols and halo butenolide to give 5-phenoxy 3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (3) derivatives, which possess a common substructure with SLs. Some of the derivatives showed SL-like activity more potently than GR24, a typical SL derivative, in a rice assay. As SLs also show activity by inducing seed germination of root parasitic plants, the induction activity of these derivatives was also evaluated. Here we report the structure-activity relationships of these compounds.
21521631	The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa L.) Os4BGlu12, an oligosaccharide and tuberonic acid glucoside-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase with significant thioglucohydrolase activity.	2011	Arch Biochem Biophys	Rice Os4BGlu12, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) β-glucosidase, hydrolyzes β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3-6 glucosyl residues and the β-(1,3)-linked disaccharide laminaribiose, as well as certain glycosides. The crystal structures of apo Os4BGlu12, and its complexes with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxyl-2-fluoroglucoside (DNP2FG) and 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose (G2F) were solved at 2.50, 2.45 and 2.40Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of rice Os4BGlu12 is typical of GH1 enzymes, but it contains an extra disulfide bridge in the loop B region. The glucose ring of the G2F in the covalent intermediate was found in a (4)C(1) chair conformation, while that of the noncovalently bound DNP2FG had a (1)S(3) skew boat, consistent with hydrolysis via a (4)H(3) half-chair transition state. The position of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu393) in the G2F structure was more similar to that of the Sinapsis alba myrosinase G2F complex than to that in covalent intermediates of other O-glucosidases, such as rice Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7 β-glucosidases. This correlated with a significant thioglucosidase activity for Os4BGlu12, although with 200- to 1200-fold lower k(cat)/K(m) values for S-glucosides than the comparable O-glucosides, while hydrolysis of S-glucosides was undetectable for Os3BGlu6 and Os3BGlu7.
21554757	IP6K gene identification in plant genomes by tag searching.	2011	BMC Proc	BACKGROUND: Plants have played a special role in inositol polyphosphate (IP) research since in plant seeds was discovered the first IP, the fully phosphorylated inositol ring of phytic acid (IP6). It is now known that phytic acid is further metabolized by the IP6 Kinases (IP6Ks) to generate IP containing pyro-phosphate moiety. The IP6K are evolutionary conserved enzymes identified in several mammalian, fungi and amoebae species. Although IP6K has not yet been identified in plant chromosomes, there are many clues suggesting its presences in vegetal cells.

RESULTS: In this paper we propose a new approach to search for the plant IP6K gene, that lead to the identification in plant genome of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a specific tag of the IP6K family. Such a tag has been found in all IP6K genes identified up to now, as well as in all genes belonging to the Inositol Polyphosphate Kinases superfamily (IPK). The tag sequence corresponds to the inositol-binding site of the enzyme, and it can be considered as characterizing all IPK genes. To this aim we applied a technique based on motif discovery. We exploited DLSME, a software recently proposed, which allows for the motif structure to be only partially specified by the user. First we applied the new method on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of plants, where such a gene could have been nested, possibly encrypted and hidden by virtue of the editing and/or trans-splicing processes. Then we looked for the gene in nuclear genome of two model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.

CONCLUSIONS: The analysis we conducted in plant mitochondria provided the negative, though we argue relevant, result that IP6K does not actually occur in vegetable mtDNA. Very interestingly, the tag search in nuclear genomes lead us to identify a promising sequence in chromosome 5 of Oryza sativa. Further analyses are in course to confirm that this sequence actually corresponds to IP6K mammalian gene.
21423286	Population-specific quantitative trait loci mapping for functional stay-green trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Genome	The functional stay-green trait gives leaves a longer duration of greenness and photosynthetic capacity during the grain-filling period. We developed two independent recombinant inbred line populations from the intra- and intersubspecific crosses of Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica 'Suweon490' (japonica) × O. sativa subsp. japonica 'SNU-SG1' (japonica) and O. sativa subsp. indica 'Andabyeo' (indica) × O. sativa subsp. japonica 'SNU-SG1' (japonica), respectively. The common parental line 'SNU-SG1' was the functional source for the stay-green trait. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping based on simple sequence repeat markers identified a total of six QTLs associated with two stay-green traits across two populations. The two traits were cumulative chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of flag leaf (CSFL) and total cumulative SPAD value of the four upper leaves (TCS). Four QTLs, tcs4, csfl6, csfl9 (or tcs9), and csfl12, located on chromosomes 4, 6, 9, and 12, respectively, were detected simultaneously in both populations. The remaining two QTLs, csfl2 (or tcs2) and tcs5, on chromosomes 2 and 5, respectively, were found to be population specific. Moreover, the functional stay-green trait of 'SNU-SG1' positively correlated with grain yield performance. Two yield QTLs, yld6 and yld9, on chromosomes 6 and 9 found in both populations were positioned at the same locations with the csfl6 and tcs9 QTLs for stay-green traits. Thus, the identified chromosomal regions can be promising targets of marker-assisted introgression of the functional stay-green trait into breeding materials for improvement of rice yield.
21417378	Structures of starches from rice mutants deficient in the starch synthase isozyme SSI or SSIIIa.	2011	Biomacromolecules	Amylose and amylopectin of rice mutants deficient in a starch synthase (SS) isozyme in the endosperm, either SSI (ΔSSI) or SSIIIa (ΔSSIIIa), were structurally altered from those of their parent (cv. Nipponbare, Np). The amylose content was higher in the mutants (Np, 15.5%; ΔSSI, 18.2%; ΔSSIIIa, 23.6%), and the molar ratio of branched amylose and its side chains was increased. The chain-length distribution of the β-amylase limit dextrins of amylopectin showed regularity, which appeared consistent with the generally accepted cluster structure, and the degrees of polymerization found at the intersections were taken as the boundaries of the B-chain fractions. The mole % of the B(1)-B(3) fractions was changed slightly in ΔSSI, which is consistent with the proposed role of SSI in elongating the external part of clusters. In ΔSSIIIa, a significant increase in the B(1) fraction and a decrease in the B(2) and B(3) fractions were observed. The internal chain length of the B(2) and B(3) fractions appeared to be slightly altered, suggesting that the deficiency in SS affected the actions of branching enzyme(s).
21505761	Population genetic structure and phylogeographical pattern of rice grasshopper, Oxya hyla intricata, across Southeast Asia.	2011	Genetica	The rice grasshopper, Oxya hyla intricata, is a rice pest in Southeast Asia. In this study, population genetic diversity and structure of this Oxya species was examined using both DNA sequences and AFLP technology. The samples of 12 populations were collected from four Southeast Asian countries, among which 175 individuals were analysed using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, and 232 individuals were examined using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to test whether the phylogeographical pattern and population genetics of this species are related to past geological events and/or climatic oscillations. No obvious trend of genetic diversity was found along a latitude/longitude gradient among different geographical groups. Phylogenetic analysis indicated three deep monophyletic clades that approximately correspond to three geographical regions separated by high mountains and a deep strait, and TCS analysis also revealed three disconnected networks, suggesting that spatial and temporal separations by vicariance, which were also supported by AMOVA as a source of the molecular variance presented among groups. Gene flow analysis showed that there had been frequent historical gene flow among local populations in different regions, but the networks exhibited no shared haplotype among populations. In conclusion, the past geological events and climatic fluctuations are the most important factor on the phylogeographical structure and genetic patterns of O. hyla intricata in Southeast Asia. Habitat, vegetation, and anthropogenic effect may also contribute to gene flow and introgression of this species. Moreover, temperature, abundant rainfall and a diversity of graminaceous species are beneficial for the migration of O. hyla intricata. High haplotype diversity, deep phylogenetic division, negative Fu's F (s) values and unimodal and multimodal distribution shapes all suggest a complicated demographic expansion pattern of these O. hyla intricata populations, which might have been caused by climatic oscillations during glacial periods in the Quaternary.
20821243	Modulation of transcription factor and metabolic pathway genes in response to water-deficit stress in rice.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Water-deficit stress is detrimental for rice growth, development, and yield. Transcriptome analysis of 1-week-old rice (Oryza sativa L. var. IR64) seedling under water-deficit stress condition using Affymetrix 57 K GeneChip® has revealed 1,563 and 1,746 genes to be up- and downregulated, respectively. In an effort to amalgamate data across laboratories, we identified 5,611 differentially expressing genes under varying extrinsic water-deficit stress conditions in six vegetative and one reproductive stage of development in rice. Transcription factors (TFs) involved in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways have been found to be upregulated during water-deficit stress. Members of zinc-finger TFs namely, C₂H₂, C₂C₂, C₃H, LIM, PHD, WRKY, ZF-HD, and ZIM, along with TF families like GeBP, jumonji, MBF1 and ULT express differentially under water-deficit conditions. NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) TF family emerges to be a potential key regulator of multiple abiotic stresses. Among the 12 TF genes that are co-upregulated under water-deficit, salt and cold stress conditions, five belong to the NAC TF family. We identified water-deficit stress-responsive genes encoding key enzymes involved in biosynthesis of osmoprotectants like polyols and sugars; amino acid and quaternary ammonium compounds; cell wall loosening and structural components; cholesterol and very long chain fatty acid; cytokinin and secondary metabolites. Comparison of genes responsive to water-deficit stress conditions with genes preferentially expressed during panicle and seed development revealed a significant overlap of transcriptome alteration and pathways.
21247905	A functional-structural model of rice linking quantitative genetic information with morphological development and physiological processes.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of yield-related traits for rice has developed rapidly, crop models using genotype information have been proposed only relatively recently. As a first step towards a generic genotype-phenotype model, we present here a three-dimensional functional-structural plant model (FSPM) of rice, in which some model parameters are controlled by functions describing the effect of main-effect and epistatic QTLs.

METHODS: The model simulates the growth and development of rice based on selected ecophysiological processes, such as photosynthesis (source process) and organ formation, growth and extension (sink processes). It was devised using GroIMP, an interactive modelling platform based on the Relational Growth Grammar formalism (RGG). RGG rules describe the course of organ initiation and extension resulting in final morphology. The link between the phenotype (as represented by the simulated rice plant) and the QTL genotype was implemented via a data interface between the rice FSPM and the QTLNetwork software, which computes predictions of QTLs from map data and measured trait data.

KEY RESULTS: Using plant height and grain yield, it is shown how QTL information for a given trait can be used in an FSPM, computing and visualizing the phenotypes of different lines of a mapping population. Furthermore, we demonstrate how modification of a particular trait feeds back on the entire plant phenotype via the physiological processes considered.

CONCLUSIONS: We linked a rice FSPM to a quantitative genetic model, thereby employing QTL information to refine model parameters and visualizing the dynamics of development of the entire phenotype as a result of ecophysiological processes, including the trait(s) for which genetic information is available. Possibilities for further extension of the model, for example for the purposes of ideotype breeding, are discussed.
21677384	Determination of genetic relationships among elite thermosensitive genic male sterile lines (TGMS) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) employing morphological and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers.	2011	J Genet	A set of morphological traits and SSR markers were used to determine the genetic relationship among 12 elite thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines developed at three different research institutions of India. Agro-morphological data recorded on 20 morphological traits revealed a wide base of genetic variation and a set of four morphological traits could distinguish most of the TGMS lines. Analysis with 30 SSR markers (20 EST-SSRs and 10 genomic SSRs) revealed 27 markers to be polymorphic, amplifying a total of 83 alleles. Each SSR marker amplified 2-6 alleles with an average of 2.76 alleles per marker and a PIC value varying from 0.54 to 0.96. Cluster analysis based on SSR and morphological data clearly differentiated the lines according to their source of origin. Correlation analysis between morphological and molecular data revealed a very poor association (r = 0.06), which could be attributed to selection pressure, genetic drift, sampling error and unknown relationship among related lines. The SSR markers discriminated the genotypes distinctly and quantified the genetic diversity precisely among the TGMS lines. Data on the yield per plant indicated that the genotypes grouping under a similar cluster showed same heterotic behaviour as compared to the genotypes from different clusters when crossed to similar pollinators.
21594293	Metabonomics study of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis rice (T2A-1) meal in a 90-day dietary toxicity study in rats.	2011	Mol Biosyst	Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. The Cry2A gene was inserted into the rice genome to help the plant combat insects. As the unintended effects of the genetically modified (GM) organisms are the most important barriers to the promotion of GM organisms, we have carried out a useful exploration to establish a new in vivo evaluation model for genetically modified foods by metabonomics methods. In this study, the rats were fed for 90 days with the GM and NON-GM rice diets. The changes in metabolites of the urine were detected using (1)H-NMR. The metabonomics were analyzed to see whether the GM rice can induce the metabolite changes in the rats' urine when compared with the NON-GM rice group. The multivariate analysis and ANOVA were used to determine the differences and the significance of differences respectively, and eventually we concluded that these differences did not have a biological significance. The conclusion of the metabonomics was comparable with that from the traditional method. As a non-invasive and dynamic monitoring method, metabonomics will be a new way of assessing the food safety of GM foods.
21528404	Expression of OsDREB2A transcription factor confers enhanced dehydration and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Biotechnol Lett	Stress responsive transcriptional regulation is an adaptive strategy of plants that alleviates the adverse effects of environmental stresses. The ectopic overexpression of Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding transcription factors (DREBs) either in homologous or in heterologous plants improved stress tolerance indicating the DRE/DREB regulon is conserved across plants. We developed 30 transgenic T(0) rice plants overexpressing OsDREB2A which were devoid of any growth penalty or phenotypic abnormalities during stressed or non-stressed conditions. Integration of T-DNA in the rice genome and stress inducible overexpression of OsDREB2A had occurred in these transgenic lines. Functional analyses of T(1)-3 and T(1)-10 lines revealed significant tolerance to osmotic, salt and dehydration stresses during simulated stress conditions with enhanced growth performance as compared to wild type. OsDREB2A, thus, confers stress tolerance in homologous rice system that failed in the heterologous Arabidopsis system earlier.
21416328	Estimating biophysical parameters of rice with remote sensing data using support vector machines.	2011	Sci China Life Sci	Hyperspectral reflectance (350-2500 nm) measurements were made over two experimental rice fields containing two cultivars treated with three levels of nitrogen application. Four different transformations of the reflectance data were analyzed for their capability to predict rice biophysical parameters, comprising leaf area index (LAI; m(2) green leaf area m(-2) soil) and green leaf chlorophyll density (GLCD; mg chlorophyll m(-2) soil), using stepwise multiple regression (SMR) models and support vector machines (SVMs). Four transformations of the rice canopy data were made, comprising reflectances (R), first-order derivative reflectances (D1), second-order derivative reflectances (D2), and logarithm transformation of reflectances (LOG). The polynomial kernel (POLY) of the SVM using R was the best model to predict rice LAI, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0496 LAI units. The analysis of variance kernel of SVM using LOG was the best model to predict rice GLCD, with an RMSE of 523.0741 mg m(-2). The SVM approach was not only superior to SMR models for predicting the rice biophysical parameters, but also provided a useful exploratory and predictive tool for analyzing different transformations of reflectance data.
21459764	Lessons from engineering a single-cell C(4) photosynthetic pathway into rice.	2011	J Exp Bot	The transfer of C(4) plant traits into C(3) plants has long been a strategy for improving the photosynthetic performance of C(3) plants. The introduction of a pathway mimicking the C(4) photosynthetic pathway into the mesophyll cells of C(3) plants was only a realistic approach when transgenic technology was sufficiently well developed and widely adopted. Here an attempt to introduce a single-cell C(4)-like pathway in which CO(2) capture and release occur in the mesophyll cell, such as the one found in the aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle, into rice (Oryza sativa L.) is described. Four enzymes involved in this pathway were successfully overproduced in the transgenic rice leaves, and 12 different sets of transgenic rice that overproduce these enzymes independently or in combination were produced and analysed. Although none of these transformants has yet shown dramatic improvements in photosynthesis, these studies nonetheless have important implications for the evolution of C(4) photosynthetic genes and their metabolic regulation, and have shed light on the unique aspects of rice physiology and metabolism. This article summarizes the lessons learned during these attempts to engineer single-cell C(4) rice.
21444336	High time for a roll call: gene duplication and phylogenetic relationships of TCP-like genes in monocots.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The TCP family is an ancient group of plant developmental transcription factors that regulate cell division in vegetative and reproductive structures and are essential in the establishment of flower zygomorphy. In-depth research on eudicot TCPs has documented their evolutionary and developmental role. This has not happened to the same extent in monocots, although zygomorphy has been critical for the diversification of Orchidaceae and Poaceae, the largest families of this group. Investigating the evolution and function of TCP-like genes in a wider group of monocots requires a detailed phylogenetic analysis of all available sequence information and a system that facilitates comparing genetic and functional information.

METHODS: The phylogenetic relationships of TCP-like genes in monocots were investigated by analysing sequences from the genomes of Zea mays, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor, as well as EST data from several other monocot species.

KEY RESULTS: All available monocot TCP-like sequences are associated in 20 major groups with an average identity ≥64 % and most correspond to well-supported clades of the phylogeny. Their sequence motifs and relationships of orthology were documented and it was found that 67 % of the TCP-like genes of Sorghum, Oryza, Zea and Brachypodium are in microsyntenic regions. This analysis suggests that two rounds of whole genome duplication drove the expansion of TCP-like genes in these species.

CONCLUSIONS: A system of classification is proposed where putative or recognized monocot TCP-like genes are assigned to a specific clade of PCF-, CIN- or CYC/tb1-like genes. Specific biases in sequence data of this family that must be tackled when studying its molecular evolution and phylogeny are documented. Finally, the significant retention of duplicated TCP genes from Zea mays is considered in the context of balanced gene drive.
21399992	Identification of QTLs for seed germination capability after various storage periods using two RIL populations in rice.	2011	Mol Cells	Seed germination capability of rice is one of the important traits in the production and storage of seeds. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seed germination capability in various storage periods was identified using two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) which derived from crosses between Milyang 23 and Tong 88-7 (MT-RILs) and between Dasanbyeo and TR22183 (DT-RILs). A total of five and three main additive effects (QTLs) associated with seed germination capability were identified in MT-RILs and DT-RILs, respectively. Among them, six QTLs were identified repeatedly in various seed storage periods designated as qMT-SGC5.1, qMT-SGC7.2, and qMT-SGC9.1 on chromosomes 5, 7, and 9 in MT-RILs, and qDT-SGC2.1, qDT-SGC3.1, and qDT-SGC9.1 on chromosomes 2, 3, and 9 in DT-RILs, respectively. The QTL on chromosome 9 was identified in both RIL populations under all three storage periods, explaining up to 40% of the phenotypic variation. Eight and eighteen pairs additive × additive epistatic effect (epistatic QTL) were identified in MT-RILs and DT-RILs, respectively. In addition, several near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed to confirm six repeatable QTL effects using controlled deterioration test (CDT). The identified QTLs will be further studied to elucidate the mechanisms controlling seed germination capability, which have important implications for long-term seed storage.
21763534	Cellular localization of dual positional specific maize lipoxygenase-1 in transgenic rice and calcium-mediated membrane association.	2011	Plant Sci	The dual positional maize lipoxygenase-1 was introduced into rice and T2 transgenic plants were produced. Cellular location of maize lipoxygenase-1 in transgenic rice and effects of calcium ion on membrane association in vitro were analyzed. Localization study by confocal microscopic analysis indicated that the maize lipoxygenase-1 was localized in cytoplasm. Sucrose-density fractionation experiment and in vitro protein transport to chloroplast showed that the maize lipoxygenase-1 can be associated with chloroplast. Secondary structure alignment revealed putative calcium binding sites in the PLAT domain of maize lipoxygenase-1 and the association of the maize lipoxygenase-1 with membranes was mediated by calcium ion in vitro. Our results provide evidences for calcium-mediated translocation of dual positional LOX without chloroplast targeting sequence from cytoplasm to chloroplast in plants for the first time.
21477784	A rice mutant displaying a heterochronically elongated internode carries a 100 kb deletion.	2011	J Genet Genomics	We have isolated a recessive rice mutant, designated as indeterminate growth (ing), which displays creeping and apparent heterochronic phenotypes in the vegetative period with lanky and winding culms. Rough mapping and subsequent molecular characterization revealed that the ing mutant carries a large deletion, which corresponds to a 103 kb region in the Nipponbare genome, containing nine annotated genes on chromosome 3. Of these annotated genes, the SLR1 gene encoding a DELLA protein is the only one that is well characterized in its function, and its null mutation, which is caused by a single base deletion in the middle of the intronless SLR1 gene, confers a slender phenotype that bears close resemblance to the ing mutant phenotype. The primary cause of the ing mutant phenotype is the deletion of the SLR1 gene, and the ing mutant appears to be the first characterized mutant having the entire SLR1 sequence deleted. Our results also suggest that the deleted region of 103 kb does not contain an indispensable gene, whose dysfunction must result in a lethal phenotype.
21634036	Fine mapping and candidate gene prediction of the photoperiod and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile gene pms1(t) in rice.	2011	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Pei'ai64S, an indica sterile variety with photoperiod and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) genes, has been widely exploited for commercial seed production for "two-line" hybrid rice in China. One PTGMS gene from Pei'ai64S, pms1(t), was mapped by a strategy of bulked-extreme and recessive-class approach with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and insert and deletion (In-Del) markers. Using linkage analysis for the F(2) mapping population consisting of 320 completely male sterile individuals derived from a cross between Pei'ai64S and 93-11 (indica restorer) lines, the pms1(t) gene was delimited to the region between the RM21242 (0.2 cM) and YF11 (0.2 cM) markers on the short arm of chromosome 7. The interval containing the pms1(t) locus, which was co-segregated with RM6776, is a 101.1 kb region based on the Nipponbare rice genome. Fourteen predicted loci were found in this region by the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Genomic Annotation. Based on the function of the locus LOC_Os07g12130 by bioinformatics analysis, it is predicted to encode a protein containing a Myb-like DNA-binding domain, and may process the transcript with thermosensory response. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results revealed that the mRNA levels of LOC_Os07g12130 were altered in different photoperiod and temperature treatments. Thus, the LOC_Os07g12130 locus is the most likely candidate gene for pms1(t). These results may facilitate not only using the molecular marker assisted selection of PTGMS genes, but also cloning of the pms1(t) gene itself.
21132544	Physiological and proteomic responses of rice peduncles to drought stress.	2011	Mol Biotechnol	Panicle exsertion, an essential physiological process for obtaining high grain yield in rice is mainly driven by peduncle (uppermost internode) elongation. Drought at heading/panicle emergence prevented peduncle elongation from reaching its maximum length even after re-watering. This inhibitory effect of drought resulted in delayed heading and trapping spikelets lower down the panicle inside the flag-leaf sheath, thus increasing sterility in the lower un-exserted spikelets and also among the upper superior spikelets whose exsertion was delayed. Intermittent drought stress caused a significant reduction in relative water content (RWC) and an increase in the abscisic acid (ABA) level of the peduncles, while both returned to normal levels upon re-watering. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed the down-regulation of GA biosynthetic genes during drought. 2D-PAGE analysis of proteins from peduncles collected under well-watered, drought-stressed, and re-watered plants revealed at least twofold differential changes in expression of 31 proteins in response to drought and most of these changes were largely reversed by re-watering. The results indicate that ABA-GA antagonism is a key focal point for understanding the failure of panicle exsertion under drought stress and the consequent increase in spikelet sterility.
21410711	The OzT8 locus in rice protects leaf carbon assimilation rate and photosynthetic capacity under ozone stress.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Tropospheric ozone (O₃) is a phytotoxic air pollutant whose current background concentrations in parts of East Asia have caused estimated rice yield losses of up to 20%; currently, however, little is known about the mechanisms of O₃ tolerance in rice. We previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in rice called OzT8, which was associated with relative dry weight under ozone stress. The photosynthetic response in SL46, a Nipponbare (NB)-Kasalath chromosome segment substitution line (SL) containing the OzT8 locus, was compared to the parent NB in multiple ozone fumigation experiments (100 ppb, 8 h d⁻¹, 23 d). By day 23, SL46 showed significantly less reduction of photosynthetic capacity compared to NB; the maximum carboxylation rate of ribulose 1·5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) decreased by 24% in SL46 compared to 49% in NB, and the maximum electron transport rate decreased by 16 and 39%, respectively. The midday carbon assimilation rates also showed a similar trend, but there was no genotypic difference in stomatal conductance. These results indicate that the OzT8 locus confers ozone tolerance via biochemical acclimation, not avoidance, making it a potentially valuable target for breeding of ozone tolerance into future rice lines. The sequence of photosynthetic response of rice to ozone stress and related tolerance factors are also discussed.
21456058	Inhibitory effects of isolated compounds from black coloured rice bran on the complement classical pathway.	2011	Phytother Res	The present study evaluated the anticomplement effects of isolated compounds from black coloured rice bran in the classical pathway of the complement system. Using column chromatography, three compounds: oryzafuran, quercetin and protocatechuic acid, were isolated and evaluated for in vitro anticomplement activity. Oryzafuran showed the most potent inhibitory activity against the complement system, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 126.2 µg/mL. This is the first report of anticomplement activity of isolated compounds from black coloured rice bran.
21295625	Pyramided rice lines harbouring Allium sativum (asal) and Galanthus nivalis (gna) lectin genes impart enhanced resistance against major sap-sucking pests.	2011	J Biotechnol	We have developed transgene pyramided rice lines, endowed with enhanced resistance to major sap-sucking insects, through sexual crosses made between two stable transgenic rice lines containing Allium sativum (asal) and Galanthus nivalis (gna) lectin genes. Presence and expression of asal and gna genes in pyramided lines were confirmed by PCR and western blot analyses. Segregation analysis of F₂ progenies disclosed digenic (9:3:3:1) inheritance of the transgenes. Homozygous F₃ plants carrying asal and gna genes were identified employing genetic and molecular methods besides insect bioassays. Pyramided lines, infested with brown planthopper (BPH), green leafhopper (GLH) and whitebacked planthopper (WBPH), proved more effective in reducing insect survival, fecundity, feeding ability besides delayed development of insects as compared to the parental transgenics. Under infested conditions, pyramided lines were found superior to the parental transgenics in their seed yield potential. This study represents first report on pyramiding of two lectin genes into rice exhibiting enhanced resistance against major sucking pests. The pyramided lines appear promising and might serve as a novel genetic resource in rice breeding aimed at durable and broad based resistance against hoppers.
21423767	Patterns of sequence divergence and evolution of the S orthologous regions between Asian and African cultivated rice species.	2011	PLoS One	A strong postzygotic reproductive barrier separates the recently diverged Asian and African cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima. Recently a model of genetic incompatibilities between three adjacent loci: S(1)A, S(1) and S(1)B (called together the S(1) regions) interacting epistatically, was postulated to cause the allelic elimination of female gametes in interspecific hybrids. Two candidate factors for the S(1) locus (including a putative F-box gene) were proposed, but candidates for S(1)A and S(1)B remained undetermined. Here, to better understand the basis of the evolution of regions involved in reproductive isolation, we studied the genic and structural changes accumulated in the S(1) regions between orthologous sequences. First, we established an 813 kb genomic sequence in O. glaberrima, covering completely the S(1)A, S(1) and the majority of the S(1)B regions, and compared it with the orthologous regions of O. sativa. An overall strong structural conservation was observed, with the exception of three isolated regions of disturbed collinearity: (1) a local invasion of transposable elements around a putative F-box gene within S(1), (2) the multiple duplication and subsequent divergence of the same F-box gene within S(1)A, (3) an interspecific chromosomal inversion in S(1)B, which restricts recombination in our O. sativa×O. glaberrima crosses. Beside these few structural variations, a uniform conservative pattern of coding sequence divergence was found all along the S(1) regions. Hence, the S(1) regions have undergone no drastic variation in their recent divergence and evolution between O. sativa and O. glaberrima, suggesting that a small accumulation of genic changes, following a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model, might be involved in the establishment of the sterility barrier. In this context, genetic incompatibilities involving the duplicated F-box genes as putative candidates, and a possible strengthening step involving the chromosomal inversion might participate to the reproductive barrier between Asian and African rice species.
21631950	Cytoplasm affects grain weight and filled-grain ratio in indica rice.	2011	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Cytoplasmic effects on agronomic traits--involving cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes of either different species or different cultivars--are well documented in wheat but have seldom been demonstrated in rice (Oryza sativa L.). To detect cytoplasmic effects, we introgressed the nuclear genomes of three indica cultivars--Guichao 2, Jiangchengkugu, and Dianrui 449--into the cytoplasms of six indica cultivars - Dijiaowujian, Shenglixian, Zhuzhan, Nantehao, Aizizhan, and Peta. These 18 nuclear substitution lines were evaluated during the winter season of 2005 in Sanya, Hainan, China, and during the summer season of 2006 in Kunming, Yunnan, China. The effects of 6 cytoplasm sources, 3 nucleus sources, 2 locations and their interactions were estimated for plant height, panicle length, panicle number per plant, spikelet number per panicle, grain weight, filled-grain ratio, and yield per plot.

RESULTS: For five of the seven traits, analysis of variance showed that there were no significant cytoplasmic effects or interactions involving cytoplasmic effects. The effect of cytoplasm on 1000-grain weight was highly significant. Mean 1000-grain weight over the two locations in four of the six cytoplasms clustered close to the overall mean, whereas plants with Nantehao cytoplasm had a high, and those with Peta cytoplasm a low mean grain weight. There was a highly significant three-way interaction affecting filled-grain ratio. At Sanya, cytoplasms varied in very narrow ranges within nuclear backgrounds. Strong cytoplasmic effects were observed only at Kunming and in only two of the three nuclear backgrounds; in the Jianchenkugu nuclear background, there was no evidence of strong cytoplasmic effects at either location. In the Dianrui 449 and Guichao 2 nuclear background evaluated at Kunming, filled-grain ratios of the six cytoplasms showed striking rank shifts

CONCLUSIONS: We detected cytoplasmic variation for two agronomically important traits in indica rice. The cytoplasm source had a significant effect on grain weight across the two experimental locations. There was also a significant cytoplasmic effect on filled-grain ratio, but only in two of three nuclear background and at one of the two locations. The results extend our previous findings with japonica rice, suggesting that the selection of appropriate cytoplasmic germplasm is broadly important in rice breeding, and that cytoplasmic effects on some traits, such as filled-grain ratio, cannot be generalized; effects should be evaluated in the nuclear backgrounds of interest and at multiple locations.
21551283	The genotype of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene (CCaMK) determines bacterial community diversity in rice roots under paddy and upland field conditions.	2011	Appl Environ Microbiol	The effects of the Oryza sativa calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsCCaMK genotype (dominant homozygous [D], heterozygous [H], recessive homozygous [R]) on rice root-associated bacteria, including endophytes and epiphytes, were examined by using a Tos17 rice mutant line under paddy and upland field conditions. Roots were sampled at the flowering stage and were subjected to clone library analyses. The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was noticeably decreased in R plants under both paddy and upland conditions (0.8% and 3.0%, respectively) relative to those in D plants (10.3% and 17.4%, respectively). Population shifts of the Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales were mainly responsible for this low abundance in R plants. The abundance of Anaerolineae (Chloroflexi) and Clostridia (Firmicutes) was increased in R plants under paddy conditions. The abundance of a subpopulation of Actinobacteria (Saccharothrix spp. and unclassified Actinosynnemataceae) was increased in R plants under upland conditions. Principal coordinate analysis revealed unidirectional community shifts in relation to OsCCaMK gene dosage under both conditions. In addition, shoot length, tiller number, and plant weight decreased as the OsCCaMK gene dosage decreased under upland conditions. These results suggest significant impacts of OsCCaMK on both the diversity of root-associated bacteria and rice plant growth under both paddy and upland field conditions.
21453428	Burkholderia glumae: next major pathogen of rice?	2011	Mol Plant Pathol	UNLABELLED: Burkholderia glumae causes bacterial panicle blight of rice, which is an increasingly important disease problem in global rice production. Toxoflavin and lipase are known to be major virulence factors of this pathogen, and their production is dependent on the TofI/TofR quorum-sensing system, which is mediated by N-octanoyl homoserine lactone. Flagellar biogenesis and a type III secretion system are also required for full virulence of B. glumae. Bacterial panicle blight is thought to be caused by seed-borne B. glumae; however, its disease cycle is not fully understood. In spite of its economic importance, neither effective control measures for bacterial panicle blight nor rice varieties showing complete resistance to the disease are currently available. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying B. glumae virulence and of the rice defence mechanisms against the pathogen would lead to the development of better methods of disease control for bacterial panicle blight.

TAXONOMY: Bacteria; Proteobacteria; Betaproteobacteria; Burkholderiales; Burkholderiaceae; Burkholderia.

MICROBIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES: Gram-negative, capsulated, motile, lophotrichous flagella, pectolytic.

DISEASE SYMPTOMS: Aborted seed, empty grains as a result of failure of grain filling, brown spots on panicles, seedling rot.

DISEASE CONTROL: Seed sterilization, planting partially resistant lines (no completely resistant line is available). KNOWN VIRULENCE FACTORS: Toxoflavin, lipase, type III effectors.
21175644	Relationships of non-structural carbohydrates accumulation and translocation with yield formation in rice recombinant inbred lines under two nitrogen levels.	2011	Physiol Plant	Stem non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) and its relationship with yield formation was investigated under low nitrogen (LN) and normal nitrogen (NN) treatments, using 46 recombinant inbred lines from Zhenshan 97 × Minghui 63 (Oryza sativa). Apparent contribution of transferred NSC to grain yield (AC(NSC) ) ranged from approximately 1 to 28% under LN and from 1 to 15% under NN. Concentration and total mass of NSC in stem (TM(NSC) ) at heading, apparent transferred mass of NSC (ATM(NSC) ) and AC(NSC) were larger under LN compared with NN. However, there was no significant difference in the apparent ratio of transferred NSC from stems to grain (AR(NSC) ). ATM(NSC) was positively correlated with grain yield, 1000-grain weight and AC(NSC) under both nitrogen levels, whereas AR(NSC) was highly correlated with harvest index and AC(NSC) . Leaf area contributed more strongly to grain yield compared with ATM(NSC) under both LN and NN. ATM(NSC) showed larger direct effects on grain yield under LN compared with NN. TM(NSC) at heading, small vascular bundles (SVBs) and spikelets per m(2) under LN had positive direct effects on ATM(NSC) . SVB and spikelets per m(2) under LN had larger and positive direct effects, and large vascular bundles had negative direct effects on AR(NSC) . TM(NSC) at heading and SVB under LN had positive direct effects on AC(NSC) . In brief, LN supply increased stem NSC accumulation and translocation to developing grain. Components of the source-sink-flow system showed different effects on NSC translocation and contribution to yield formation, depending on genotype and nitrogen level.
21780582	[Effect of hyacinth mulching on rice (Oryza sativa L.) uptake and utilization of nitrogen].	2011	Huan Jing Ke Xue	Nitrogen is the most important element for rice growth, and hyacinth can absorb large quantities of nitrogen and accumulate in their tissues. The field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of hyacinth mulching on rice nitrogen (N) concentration, uptake, efficiency and allocation at different growth stages. Taked Yun 2645 as a material, the nitrogen uptake and utilization of rice were evaluated under two different levels of N input: low (LN, 120 kg x hm(-2)) and normal N (NN, 240 kg x hm(-2)) in 2009. Main results showed that: (1) Compared with AMB, hyacinth mulching significantly increased N concentration in rice plant over the season, hyacinth mulching significantly increased nitrogen accumulation in rice plant, and the increasing rate was gradual addition from mid-tillering to heading, but from heading to maturity the increasing rate was gradual decline. (2) Hyacinth mulching had no obvious effect on nitrogen allocation pattern in leaves and stems of rice over the season, significantly decreased nitrogen allocation pattern in spikes. (3) Except mid-tillering, hyacinth mulching resulted in the significant decrease in N use efficiency for biomass (NUEp) over the season and in N use efficiency for grain yield (NUEg) at grain maturity, but no effect was observed on nitrogen harvest index (NHI). (4) Nitrogen concentration and accumulation at most growth stages of rice increased with increasing N supply (p < 0.05 or 0.01), but NUEp and NUEg showed the opposite trends. 1(5) nteractions between hyacinth mulching x N were not observed for N uptake and utilization. Hyacinth mulching increased N concentration and N uptake, decreased NUEp and NUEg at most growth stages of rice.
21061188	Pollen-specific expression of Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA) promoter in rice and Arabidopsis transgenic systems.	2011	Mol Biotechnol	Earlier, a pollen-specific Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen gene (OSIPA), coding for expansins/pollen allergens, was isolated from rice, and its promoter--upon expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis--was found active during the late stages of pollen development. In this investigation, to analyze the effects of different putative regulatory motifs of OSIPA promoter, a series of 5' deletions were fused to β-glucuronidase gene (GUS) which were stably introduced into rice and Arabidopsis. Histochemical GUS analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that a 1631 bp promoter fragment mediates maximum GUS expression at different stages of anther/pollen development. Promoter deletions to -1272, -966, -617, and -199 bp did not change the expression profile of the pollen specificity. However, the activity of promoter was reduced as the length of promoter decreased. The region between -1567 and -199 bp was found adequate to confer pollen-specific expression in both rice and Arabidopsis systems. An approximate 4-fold increase in the GUS activity was observed in the pollen of rice when compared to that of Arabidopsis. As such, the OSIPA promoter seems promising for generation of stable male-sterile lines required for the production of hybrids in rice and other crop plants.
21163697	Ethanol production from ensiled rice straw and whole-crop silage by the simultaneous enzymatic saccharification and fermentation process.	2011	J Biosci Bioeng	Silage production from rice straw and whole-plant forage paddy rice is increasing in Japan because of decrease in rice consumption. One potential use for this silage is bioethanol production. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of three different commercially available cellulases at saccharification of sun-dried rice straw, ensiled rice straw, and rice whole-crop silage (WCS). Furthermore, the ethanol productivity of the simultaneous saccharification and ethanol fermentation process (SSF) from the same plant substrates was analyzed. Among the three kinds of cellulases tested (Novozymes NS50013, Genencor GC220, and Acremonium cellulase), Acremonium cellulase showed the highest ethanol production for the three plant substrates, and the WCS produced the highest ethanol level. Analysis of the enzymatic degradation activity of the cellulases revealed that Acremonium cellulase contained remarkably high glucoamylase and pectinase side activities relative to the other cellulase preparations. The addition of glucoamylase and pectinase to the other two cellulases significantly increased ethanol productivity to levels observed for the Acremonium cellulase preparation, which showed little enhanced performance with the addition of the same enzymes. Finally, we tested whether milling and sterilization had an effect on ethanol production and found that sterilized silage produced higher ethanol levels but that the milling process had no significant effect. These results show that (i) silage made from whole-plant rice can be used for bioethanol production and (ii) the proper selection and combination of commercially available enzymes can make SSF more cost efficient by removing the need for a pre-treatment step.
21323642	Evident and latent plasticity across the rice diterpene synthase family with potential implications for the evolution of diterpenoid metabolism in the cereals.	2011	Biochem J	The evolution of natural product biosynthetic pathways can be envisioned to occur via a number of mechanisms. In the present study we provide evidence that latent plasticity plays a role in such metabolic evolution. In particular, rice (Oryza sativa) produces both ent- and syn-CPP (copalyl diphosphate), which are substrates for downstream diterpene synthases. In the present paper we report that several members of this enzymatic family exhibit dual reactivity with some pairing of ent-, syn- or normal CPP stereochemistry. Evident plasticity was observed, as a previously reported ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase also converts syn-CPP into syn-labda-8(17),12E,14-triene, which can be found in planta. Notably, normal CPP is not naturally found in rice. Thus the presence of diterpene synthases that react with this non-native metabolite reveals latent enzymatic/metabolic plasticity, providing biochemical capacity for utilization of such a novel substrate (i.e. normal CPP) which may arise during evolution, the implications of which are discussed.
21460234	Structural implications into dsRNA binding and RNA silencing suppression by NS3 protein of Rice Hoja Blanca Tenuivirus.	2011	RNA	Rice Hoja Blanca Tenuivirus (RHBV), a negative strand RNA virus, has been identified to infect rice and is widely transmitted by the insect vector. NS3 protein encoded by RHBV RNA3 was reported to be a potent RNAi suppressor to counterdefense RNA silencing in plants, insect cells, and mammalian cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of RHBV NS3 (residues 21-114) at 2.0 Å. RHBV NS3 N-terminal domain forms a dimer by two pairs of α-helices in an anti-parallel mode, with one surface harboring a shallow groove at the dimension of 20 Å × 30 Å for putative dsRNA binding. In vitro RNA binding assay and RNA silencing suppression assay have demonstrated that the structural conserved residues located along this shallow groove, such as Arg50, His51, Lys77, and His85, participate in dsRNA binding and RNA silencing suppression. Our results provide the initial structural implications in understanding the RNAi suppression mechanism by RHBV NS3.
21556691	Characterization of an immunomodulatory Der p 2-FIP-fve fusion protein produced in transformed rice suspension cell culture.	2012	Transgenic Res	Der p 2, a major allergen of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus mites, is one of the most clinically relevant allergens to allergic patients worldwide. FIP-fve protein (Fve) from the golden needle mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) is an immunomodulatory protein with potential Th1-skewed adjuvant properties. Here, we produced and immunologically evaluated a Der p 2-Fve fusion protein as a potential immunotherapeutic for allergic diseases. Using an inducible expression system in cultured rice suspension cells, the recombinant Der p 2-Fve fusion protein (designated as OsDp2Fve) was expressed in rice cells under the control of an α-amylase gene (αAmy8) promoter and secreted under sucrose starvation. OsDp2Fve was partially purified from the cultured medium. The conformation of Der p 2 in OsDp2Fve remains intact as reflected by its unaltered allergenicity, as assessed by human IgE ELISA and histamine release assays, compared to non-fusion Der p 2 protein. Furthermore, the Fve protein expressed in OsDp2Fve retains its in vitro lymphoproliferative activity but loses its hemagglutination and lymphoagglutination effects compared to the native protein. Notably, in vivo evaluation showed that mice administered with OsDp2Fve possessed an enhanced production of Der p 2-specific IgG antibodies without potentiating the production of Der p 2-specific IgE and Th2 effector cytokines in comparison with mice co-administered with native Fve and Der p 2 proteins. These results suggest that the recombinant Der p 2-Fve fusion protein produced in rice suspension cell cultures has a great potential for allergy immunotherapy.
21448341	Transgenic rice expressing amyloid β-peptide for oral immunization.	2011	Int J Biol Sci	Various vaccine therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been investigated. Here we report transgenic rice expressing amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). The Aβ42 gene fused with a green fluorescent protein gene was introduced into rice using the Agrobacterium method. When transgenic brown rice expressing Aβ was orally administered to mice, serum anti-Aβ antibody titers were elevated. The same results were observed when mice were fed boiled, transgenic brown rice. The results indicate that an edible vaccine against AD using rice may be feasible. A vaccine derived from rice would be far cheaper than existing medical vaccines.
21451246	Heat-inducible Cre-lox system for marker excision in transgenic rice.	2011	J Biosci	The present study assessed the efficacy of a heat-inducible cre gene for conditional removal of the marker gene from a rice genome via Cre-lox recombination. A cre gene controlled by the soybean heat-shock promoter was introduced into the rice genome along with the recombination target (lox) construct. Cre-mediated recombination was expected to remove the marker gene and activate the promoter-less GUS gene. Six transgenic lines displayed well-regulated heat-inducible Cre activity in the callus. However, only one line that contained a single copy of the cre gene maintained this property in the regenerated plants and their progeny. Marker-free progeny were obtained from the plant that was heat-treated at the seedling stage, indicating the inheritance of the recombination 'footprint'. The presence of the 'footprint' was verified by polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis. Therefore, the cre gene controlled by the soybean heat-shock promoter is an effective tool for conditional removal of the marker gene in rice.
21210840	Molecular cloning of a plant N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase and its expression characteristics in rice.	2011	J Pineal Res	N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT), the last enzyme in the synthesis of melatonin, catalyzes N-acetylserotonin into melatonin. For the first time, we cloned ASMT from rice through the analysis of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring putative rice O-methyltransferase (OMT) cDNAs. In total, 18 full-length cDNAs, which show homology to wheat caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, were expressed in E. coli and induced in the presence of N-acetylserotonin; we then analyzed the production of melatonin. Only recombinant E. coli line 15 showed melatonin synthesis; no other recombinant lines produced melatonin with the addition of N-acetylserotonin in E. coli culture. Line 15 clearly exhibited in vitro ASMT enzyme activity with 0.27 pkat/mg protein. ASMT enzyme activity was inhibited by various related compounds such as N-acetyltryptamine and N-acetyltyrosine. The open reading frame of ASMT consists of 364 amino acids possessing well-conserved motifs found in plant OMT such as S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding and catalytic sites. Induction patterns of ASMT mRNA were well matched with the production of melatonin in rice leaves during senescence, as well as several stressors.
21494323	Biochemical and structural properties of cyanases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2011	PLoS One	Cyanate is toxic to all organisms. Cyanase converts cyanate to CO₂ and NH₃ in a bicarbonate-dependent reaction. The biophysical functions and biochemical characteristics of plant cyanases are poorly studied, although it has been investigated in a variety of proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi. In this study, we characterised plant cyanases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (AtCYN and OsCYN). Prokaryotic-expressed AtCYN and OsCYN both showed cyanase activity in vitro. Temperature had a similar influence on the activity of both cyanases, but pH had a differential impact on AtCYN and OsCYN activity. Homology modelling provided models of monomers of AtCYN and OsCYN, and a coimmunoprecipitation assay and gel filtration indicated that AtCYN and OsCYN formed homodecamers. The analysis of single-residue mutants of AtCYN indicated that the conserved catalytic residues also contributed to the stability of the homodecamer. KCNO treatment inhibited Arabidopsis germination and early seedling growth. Plants containing AtCYN or OsCYN exhibited resistance to KCNO stress, which demonstrated that one role of cyanases in plants is detoxification. Transcription level of AtCYN was higher in the flower than in other organs of Arabidopsis. AtCYN transcription was not significantly affected by KCNO treatment in Arabidopsis, but was induced by salt stress. This research broadens our knowledge on plant detoxification of cyanate via cyanase.
21520392	Breeding of commercially acceptable allelopathic rice cultivars in China.	2011	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: One promising area of paddy weed control is the potential for exploiting the weed-suppressing ability of rice. This study was conducted to develop commercially acceptable allelopathic rice cultivars using crosses between allelopathic rice variety PI312777 and commercial Chinese cultivars (N2S, N9S, Huahui354, Peiai64S and Tehuazhan35), and to assess their weed suppression and grain yield in paddy fields in relation to their parents.

RESULTS: There was a positive dominance in the crosses Huahui354 × PI312777 and N2S × PI312777 but recessive or negative dominance in N9S × PI312777, Peiai64S × PI312777 and Tehuazhan35 × PI312777. Huahui354 × PI312777 and N2S × PI312777 showed stronger weed suppression than their parents and other crosses. Finally, an F8 line with an appearance close to Huahui354 and a magnitude of weed suppression close to PI312777 was obtained from Huahui354 × PI312777. This line, named Huagan-3, was released as a first commercially acceptable allelopathic rice cultivar in China. The grain yield and quality of Huagan-3 met the commercial standard of the local rice industry. Huagan-3 greatly suppressed paddy weeds, although suppression was influenced by year-to-year variation and plant density. There was no certain yield reduction in Huagan-3 even under a slight infestation of barnyard grass in paddy fields.

CONCLUSION: The successful breeding of Huagan-3 with high yield and strong weed suppression may be incorporated into present rice production systems to minimise the amount of herbicide used.
21677691	Identification and isolation of active N2O reducers in rice paddy soil.	2011	ISME J	Dissolved N(2)O is occasionally detected in surface and ground water in rice paddy fields, whereas little or no N(2)O is emitted to the atmosphere above these fields. This indicates the occurrence of N(2)O reduction in rice paddy fields; however, identity of the N(2)O reducers is largely unknown. In this study, we employed both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches to identify N(2)O reducers in rice paddy soil. In a soil microcosm, N(2)O and succinate were added as the electron acceptor and donor, respectively, for N(2)O reduction. For the stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment, (13)C-labeled succinate was used to identify succinate-assimilating microbes under N(2)O-reducing conditions. DNA was extracted 24  h after incubation, and heavy and light DNA fractions were separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis targeting the 16S rRNA and the N(2)O reductase gene were performed. For culture-dependent analysis, the microbes that elongated under N(2)O-reducing conditions in the presence of cell-division inhibitors were individually captured by a micromanipulator and transferred to a low-nutrient medium. The N(2)O-reducing ability of these strains was examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results of the SIP analysis suggested that Burkholderiales and Rhodospirillales bacteria dominated the population under N(2)O-reducing conditions, in contrast to the control sample (soil incubated with only (13)C-succinate). Results of the single-cell isolation technique also indicated that the majority of the N(2)O-reducing strains belonged to the genera Herbaspirillum (Burkholderiales) and Azospirillum (Rhodospirillales). In addition, Herbaspirillum strains reduced N(2)O faster than Azospirillum strains. These results suggest that Herbaspirillum spp. may have an important role in N(2)O reduction in rice paddy soils.
21113019	Identification and analysis of seven H₂O₂-responsive miRNAs and 32 new miRNAs in the seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2011	Nucleic Acids Res	Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we employed high throughput sequencing combined with computational analysis to survey miRNAomes from the seedlings of rice under normal conditions and treatments of H(2)O(2) that result in oxidative stress. Comparison of the miRNAomes and subsequent northern blot analysis identified seven miRNA families differentially expressed under H(2)O(2) stress. Predicted and experimentally validated targets of these H(2)O(2)-responsive miRNAs are involved in different cellular responses and metabolic processes including transcriptional regulation, nutrient transport, auxin homeostasis, cell proliferation and programmed cell death. This indicates that diverse miRNAs form a complex regulatory network to coordinate plants' responses under oxidative stress. In addition, we also discovered 32 new miRNAs in the seedlings of rice. Interestingly, of these new miRNAs, miR3981 was originally found to be a putative exonic miRNA located in the exon of AK106348, suggesting that plants may also use some exons as an miRNA source. This study is the first genome-wide investigation of H(2)O(2)-regulated miRNAs in plants and broadens our perspectives on the important regulatory roles of miRNAs in plant oxidative stress and physiological adaption.
21499832	Rice Importin β1 gene affects pollen tube elongation.	2011	Mol Cells	Importin β1 interacts with nuclear transport factors and mediates the import of nuclear proteins. We isolated a pollen-expressed gene, rice Importin β1 (OsImpβ1), from a T-DNA insertional population that was trapped by a promoterless β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. The GUS reporter was expressed in the anthers and ovaries from early through mature developmental stages. Its expression was also observed in all floral organs. However, these patterns changed as the spikelet developed. T-DNA was inserted into the OsImpβ1 gene at 339 bp downstream from the translation initiation site. We obtained another T-DNA insertional allele by searching the flanking sequence tag database. In both lines, the wild-type and T-DNA-carrying progeny segregated at a ratio close to 1:1. The latter genotype was heterozygous (OsImpβ1/osimpβ1). Reciprocal crosses between WT and heterozygous plants demonstrated that the mutant alleles could not be transmitted through the male gametophyte. Close examination of the heterozygous anthers revealed that the mutant pollen matured normally. However, in vitro assays showed that tube elongation was hampered in the mutant grains. These results indicate that OsImpβ1 is specifically required for pollen tube elongation.
21416320	Identification of Pns12 as the second silencing suppressor of Rice gall dwarf virus.	2011	Sci China Life Sci	RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism found ubiquitously in eukaryotic organisms. It has been used to regulate gene expression and development. In addition, RNA silencing serves as an important mechanism in plants' defense against invasive nucleic acids, such as viruses, transposons, and transgenes. As a counter-defense, most plants, and some animal viruses, encode RNA silencing suppressors to interfere at one or several points of the silencing pathway. In this study, we showed that Pns12 of RGDV (Rice gall dwarf virus) exhibits silencing suppressor activity on the reporter green fluorescent protein in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line 16c. Pns12 of RGDV suppressed local silencing induced by sense RNA but had no effect on that induced by dsRNA. Expression of Pns12 also enhanced Potato virus X pathogenicity in N. benthamiana. Collectively, these results suggested that RGDV Pns12 functions as a virus suppressor of RNA silencing, which might target an upstream step of dsRNA formation in the RNA silencing pathway. Furthermore, we showed that Pns12 is localized mainly in the nucleus of N. benthamiana leaf cells.
21703279	Using the concept of pseudo amino acid composition to predict resistance gene against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice: an approach from chaos games representation.	2011	J Theor Biol	To evaluate the possibility of an unknown protein to be a resistant gene against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, a different mode of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) is proposed to formulate the protein samples by integrating the amino acid composition, as well as the Chaos games representation (CGR) method. Some numerical comparisons of triangle, quadrangle and 12-vertex polygon CGR are carried to evaluate the efficiency of using these fractal figures in classifiers. The numerical results show that among the three polygon methods, triangle method owns a good fractal visualization and performs the best in the classifier construction. By using triangle + 12-vertex polygon CGR as the mathematical feature, the classifier achieves 98.13% in Jackknife test and MCC achieves 0.8462.
21213008	Genome-wide analysis of rice and Arabidopsis identifies two glyoxalase genes that are highly expressed in abiotic stresses.	2011	Funct Integr Genomics	Glyoxalase pathway, ubiquitously found in all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, consists of glyoxalase I (GLY I) and glyoxalase II (GLY II) enzymes, which detoxify a cytotoxic molecule, methylglyoxal (MG). Increase in MG has been correlated with various diseases in humans and different abiotic stresses in plants. We have previously shown that overproduction of GLY I and/or GLY II enzymes in transgenic plants provide tolerance towards salinity and heavy metal stresses. We have identified nineteen potential GLY I and four GLY II proteins in rice and twenty two GLY I and nine GLY II proteins in Arabidopsis. An analysis of complete set of genes coding for the glyoxalase proteins in these two genomes is presented, including classification and chromosomal distribution. Expression profiling of these genes has been performed in response to multiple abiotic stresses, in different tissues and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development using publicly available databases (massively parallel signature sequencing and microarray). AtGLYI8, OsGLYI3, and OsGLYI10 expresses constitutively high in seeds while AtGLYI4, AtGLYI7, OsGLYI6, and OsGLYI11 are highly stress inducible. To complement this analyses, qRT-PCR is performed in two contrasting rice genotypes, i.e., IR64 and Pokkali where OsGLYI6 and OsGLYI11 are found to be highly stress inducible.
21533550	Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane.	2011	Mol Cells	Systematic searches using the complete genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) identified OsSUS7, a new member of the rice sucrose synthase (OsSUS) gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci. In particular, a 17.6-kb genomic region containing transposable elements was identified in the 5' upstream sequence of the OsSUS7 gene. GFP fusion experiments indicated that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 are largely associated with the plasma membrane and partly with the cytosol in maize mesophyll protoplasts. RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots. These results suggest that two redundant genes, OsSUS5 and OsSUS7, evolved via duplication of a chromosome region and through the transposition of transposable elements.
21370396	Agronomic performance of F1, F2 and F3 hybrids between weedy rice and transgenic glufosinate-resistant rice.	2011	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Studies of hybrid fitness, of which agronomic performance may be an indicator, can help in evaluating the potential for introgression of a transgene from a transgenic crop to wild relatives. The objective of this study was to assess the agronomic performance of reciprocal hybrids between two transgenic glufosinate-resistant rice lines, Y0003 and 99-t, and two weedy rice accessions, WR1 and WR2, in the greenhouse.

RESULTS: F1 hybrids displayed heterosis in height, flag leaf area and number of spikelets per panicle. The agronomic performance of F1 between WR1 and Y0003 was not affected by crossing direction. The tiller and panicle numbers of F1 individuals were higher than their F2 counterparts. However, these traits did not change significantly from the F2 to the F3 generation or in hybrids with weedy rice as maternal or paternal plants. For all hybrids, the in vitro germination rates of fresh pollen were similar and significantly lower than those of their parents, seed sets were similar to or of lower value than those of weedy rice parents and seed shattering characteristics were partially suppressed, but the survival of hybrids over winter in the field was similar to that of weedy rice parents. All F1, F2 and F3 hybrids had similar composite agronomic performance to weedy rice parents.

CONCLUSION: There was no significant decrease in the composite agronomic performance of any of the hybrids compared with weedy rice. This implies that gene flow from transgenic cultivated rice to weedy rice could occur under natural conditions.
21481190	Expression analysis of the nucleocytoplasmic lectin 'Orysata' from rice in Pichia pastoris.	2011	FEBS J	The Oryza sativa lectin, abbreviated Orysata, is a mannose-specific, jacalin-related lectin expressed in rice plants after exposure to certain stress conditions. Expression of a fusion construct containing the rice lectin sequence linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein in Bright Yellow 2 tobacco cells revealed that Orysata is located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the plant cell, indicating that it belongs to the class of nucleocytoplasmic jacalin-related lectins. Since the expression level of Orysata in rice tissues is very low the lectin was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris with the Saccharomyces α-factor sequence to direct the recombinant protein into the secretory pathway and express the protein into the medium. Approximately 12 mg of recombinant lectin was purified per liter medium. SDS/PAGE and western blot analysis showed that the recombinant lectin exists in two molecular forms. Far western blot analysis revealed that the 23 kDa lectin polypeptide contains an N-glycan which is absent in the 18.5 kDa polypeptide. Characterization of the glycans present in the recombinant Orysata revealed high-mannose structures, Man9-11 glycans being the most abundant. Glycan array analysis showed that Orysata interacts with high-mannose as well as with more complex N-glycan structures. Orysata has potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus and anti-respiratory syncytial virus activity in cell culture compared with other jacalin-related lectins.
21686154	Serine proteases-like genes in the asian rice gall midge show differential expression in compatible and incompatible interactions with rice.	2011	Int J Mol Sci	The Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason), is a serious pest of rice. Investigations into the gall midge-rice interaction will unveil the underlying molecular mechanisms which, in turn, can be used as a tool to assist in developing suitable integrated pest management strategies. The insect gut is known to be involved in various physiological and biological processes including digestion, detoxification and interaction with the host. We have cloned and identified two genes, OoprotI and OoprotII, homologous to serine proteases with the conserved His(87), Asp(136) and Ser(241) residues. OoProtI shared 52.26% identity with mosquito-type trypsin from Hessian fly whereas OoProtII showed 52.49% identity to complement component activated C1s from the Hessian fly. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed that both the genes were significantly upregulated in larvae feeding on resistant cultivar than in those feeding on susceptible cultivar. These results provide an opportunity to understand the gut physiology of the insect under compatible or incompatible interactions with the host. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes in the clade containing proteases of phytophagous insects away from hematophagous insects.
21526825	Triterpene cyclases from Oryza sativa L.: cycloartenol, parkeol and achilleol B synthases.	2011	Org Lett	The gene products of AK121211, AK066327, and AK070534 from Oryza sativa encode cycloartenol, parkeol, and achilleol B synthases, respectively. Parkeol synthase is a unique enzyme that affords parkeol as a single product. Achilleol B synthase is the third seco-type triterpene cyclase identified to date, and triterpenes produced by this synthase include achilleol B (90%), tetracyclic (5.12%) and pentacyclic scaffolds (4.37%), and unidentified triterpenes (0.51%). The pathway for achilleol B biosynthesis is proposed.
21633982	Purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) extract and its constituents inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis.	2012	Phytother Res	The study evaluated the protective effects of purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) bran extract (PRE) and its constituents, cyanidin and peonidin, against angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The effects of VEGF and PRE were examined by in vitro tube formation assays and following 14-day co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts. The antiangiogenic mechanism of PRE was evaluated by VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs and/or human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. The PRE significantly suppressed VEGF-induced tube formation, proliferation and migration in HUVECs and HRMECs as well as phosphorylation of ERK and p38. Cyanidin and peonidin also suppressed the proliferation and migration induced by VEGF. These findings indicate that PRE and anthocyanidins suppress VEGF-induced angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and migration and suggest that the inhibition of phosphorylated-ERK and -p38 may be involved in the underlying mechanism.
21763536	Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf base derived callus tissues of popular indica rice (Oryza sativa L. sub sp. indica cv. ADT 43).	2011	Plant Sci	A simple and efficient protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of an agronomically useful abiotic sensitive popular indica rice cv. ADT 43 has been developed. Initiation of calli were best achieved from the leaf bases of 4 days old rice seedlings on LS medium supplemented with 2.5mg/L 2,4-D and 1.0mg/L thiamine-HCl. Rice calli immersed in Agrobacterium suspension (strain EHA 105, OD(600)=0.8) were co-cultured on LS30-AsPC medium for 2 days at 25±2°C in the dark. Based on GUS expression analysis, 10min co-cultivation time with 100μM acetosyringone was found optimum for the delivery of gus gene. Calli were proved to be very sensitive to Agrobacterium infection and we found that the level of necrotic response can be minimized after co-cultivation with 30% LS, 10g/L PVP, 10% coconut water and 250mg/L timentin which improved the final transformation efficiency to 9.33%. Molecular and genetic analysis of transgenic plants reveals the integration, expression and inheritance of transgene in the progeny (T(1)) of these plants. The copy number of transgenes has been found to vary from 1 to 2 in transgenic plants (T(0) and T(1)).
21607616	A proteomic approach to analyze nitrogen- and cytokinin-responsive proteins in rice roots.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Nitrogen plays a central role in rice growth and development because it modulates a wide variety of processes, including cytokinin (CK) metabolism. CK-mediated signaling is also related to nitrogen metabolism. The functional relation between nitrogen and CK are extremely complex and unclear. In this study, a comparative proteomic analysis was carried out to analyze proteins regulated by nitrogen and CK in rice roots. Proteins extracted from rice roots are separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thirty-two protein spots that expressed similarly by nitrogen and CK treatments are selected for identification by mass spectrometry. Of these spots, 28 are successfully identified. These proteins were categorized into classes related to energy, metabolism, disease/defense, protein degradation, signal transduction, transposons, and unclear classification. Energy gives the largest functional category, suggesting that the glycolysis (two enzymes detected) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (six enzymes detected) are accurately regulated by nitrogen and CK, thus promoting the synthesis of amino acid. The identification of novel proteins provides new insights into the coordination of nitrogen and CK in rice. The possible role of these proteins is discussed.
21388921	Strain-specific SCAR markers for the detection of Trichoderma harzianum AS12-2, a biological control agent against Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of rice sheath blight.	2011	Acta Biol Hung	In order to identify a specific marker for T. harzianum AS12-2, a strain capable of controlling rice sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani, UP-PCR was performed using five universal primers (UP) both separately and in pairwise combinations. The application of two UP primers resulted in the amplification of unique fragments from the genomic DNA of T. harzianum AS12-2, clearly distinguishing it from other Trichoderma strains. The unique fragments had no significant sequence homology with any other known sequence available in databases. Based on the sequences of the unique fragments, 14 oligonucleotide primers were designed. Two primer sets amplified a fragment of expected size from the DNA of strain T. harzianum AS12-2 but not from any other examined strains belonging to T. harzianum, to other Trichoderma species assayed, or to other common fungi present in paddy fields of Mazandaran province, Iran. In conclusion, SCAR (sequence characterized amplified regions) markers were successfully identified and rapid, reliable tools were provided for the detection of an effective biocontrol Trichoderma strain, which can facilitate studies of its population dynamics and establishment after release into the natural environment.
21504892	GC-biased gene conversion and selection affect GC content in the Oryza genus (rice).	2011	Mol Biol Evol	Base composition varies among and within eukaryote genomes. Although mutational bias and selection have initially been invoked, more recently GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has been proposed to play a central role in shaping nucleotide landscapes, especially in yeast, mammals, and birds. gBGC is a kind of meiotic drive in favor of G and C alleles, associated with recombination. Previous studies have also suggested that gBGC could be at work in grass genomes. However, these studies were carried on third codon positions that can undergo selection on codon usage. As most preferred codons end in G or C in grasses, gBGC and selection can be confounded. Here we investigated further the forces that might drive GC content evolution in the rice genus using both coding and noncoding sequences. We found that recombination rates correlate positively with equilibrium GC content and that selfing species (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima) have significantly lower equilibrium GC content compared with more outcrossing species. As recombination is less efficient in selfing species, these results suggest that recombination drives GC content. We also detected a positive relationship between expression levels and GC content in third codon positions, suggesting that selection favors codons ending with G or C bases. However, the correlation between GC content and recombination cannot be explained by selection on codon usage alone as it was also observed in noncoding positions. Finally, analyses of polymorphism data ruled out the hypothesis that genomic variation in GC content is due to mutational processes. Our results suggest that both gBGC and selection on codon usage affect GC content in the Oryza genus and likely in other grass species.
21677387	Validation and dissection of quantitative trait loci for leaf traits in interval RM4923-RM402 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6.	2011	J Genet	Validation and dissection of a QTL region for leaf traits in rice which has been reported in a number of independent studies were conducted. Three sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) were originated from a residual heterozygous line derived the indica cross Zhenshan 97B/Milyang 46. They were overlapping and totally covered a 4.2-Mb heterogenous region extending from RM4923 to RM402 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6. Each NIL set consisted of 10 maternal lines and 10 paternal lines. They were measured for the length, width, perimeter and area of the top three leaves and the number of spikelets per panicle, number of grains per panicle and grain weight per panicle. In NIL sets 6-4 and 6-7, differing in intervals RM4923-RM225 and RM19410-RM6119, respectively, significant variations with the enhancing alleles from the female parent ZS97 were shown for the length, perimeter and area except for the area of the third leaf from top in 6-4, but the effects were lower in 6-4 than in 6-7. No significant effects were detected for the three traits in the remaining NIL set. It was shown that flag leaf length (FLL) is the primary target of the QTLs detected. Two QTLs for FLL linked in repulsion phase were resolved, of which qFLL6.2 located in the 1.19-Mb interval RM3414-RM6917 had a major effect with the enhancing allele from Zhenshan 97B, and qFLL6.1 located in the 946.8-kb interval RM19350-RM19410 had a smaller effect with the enhancing allele from Milyang 46. The two QTLs also exerted pleiotropic effects on the yield traits.
21558459	Analyses of two rice (Oryza sativa) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and effects of transgenic expression of OsiICK6 on plant growth and development.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants have a family of proteins referred to as ICKs (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK) or KRPs (Kip-related proteins) that function to regulate the activities of CDK. Knowledge of these plant CDK inhibitors has been gained mostly from studies of selected members in dicotyledonous plants, particularly Arabidopsis. Much remains to be learned regarding the differences among various members of the ICK/KRP family, and regarding the function and regulation of these proteins in monocotyledonous plants.

METHODS: We analysed ICK-related sequences in the rice (Orysa sativa L. subsp. indica) genome and determined that there are six members with the conserved C-terminal signature region for ICK/KRP proteins. They are referred to as OsiICKs and further analyses were performed. The interactions with CDKs and cyclins were determined by a yeast two-hybrid assay, and cellular localization by fusion with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expression of OsiICK6 in different tissues and in response to several treatments was analysed by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Furthermore, OsiICK6 was over-expressed in transgenic rice plants and significant phenotypes were observed.

KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively. Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA. Both EGFP:OsiICK1 and EGFP:OsiICK6 were localized in the nucleus. Whereas EGFP:OsiICK6 showed a punctuate subnuclear distribution, OsiICK1 had a homogeneous pattern. Over-expression of OsiICK6 resulted in multiple phenotypic effects on plant growth, morphology, pollen viability and seed setting. In OsiICK6-over-expressing plants, leaves rolled toward the abaxial side, suggesting that cell proliferation is critical in maintaining an even growth along the dorsal-ventral plane of leaf blades.
21512221	Characterization of recombinant β-amylases from Oryza sativa.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Four putative β-amylase genes found in the Oryza sativa cDNA sequence database (KOME) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant proteins from two of these genes showed β-amylase activity. Similarly to β-amylases from other plants, the optimum pH of the recombinant rice β-amylases was about 5.5-6.0, but they exhibited inferior heat stability to soybean β-amylase.
21214879	Reappraisal of nitrogen use efficiency in rice overexpressing glutamine synthetase1.	2011	Physiol Plant	Cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1) is responsible for the primary assimilation of ammonia, and a role in nitrogen (N) remobilization is implicated from its vascular localization and enhanced expression during senescence. This paper tested the hypothesis that overexpression (OX) of GS1 in rice improves utilization N use efficiency (UtE = spikelet yield/shoot N content). Three GS1 OX lines were identified using activity assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Physiological analysis of the OX lines, as well as azygous and wild-type (Wt) controls, was conducted with mature plants after growth under varying nitrate conditions (non-limiting N, limiting N, transfer from non-limiting N to limiting N at panicle emergence) and growth environments (growth chamber vs greenhouse). Overall, OX lines did not differ from azygous controls in vegetative yield or shoot N content. In two of the three growth trials (i.e. the growth chamber trials) harvest index, N harvest index (spikelet N content/shoot N content) and UtE were generally enhanced in the OX lines relative to their azygous controls. These characteristics were highly correlated with percent spikelets filled and spikelet number. Thus, N partitioning in rice during grain filling could be altered by GS1 OX, resulting in improved UtE. Unfortunately, GS OX did not result in more efficient use of N under limiting N than under non-limiting N, and is therefore unlikely to result in the use of less N under field conditions. Transformation effects significantly hindered the productivity of the OX lines, but backcrossing to the Wt should overcome this.
21474375	Effect of enzymatic treatment on sedimentation and flocculation abilities of solid particles in rice washing drainage and its relationship with protein profiles.	2011	J Biosci Bioeng	In this research, the protein participation that occurs with the flocculation and sedimentation phenomena caused by adding enzymes to solid particles derived from rice washing drainage and the electrostatic properties of the solid particle surfaces was examined. As seen in the results, adding protease to rice washing drainage decreased the protein content, strengthened the negative surface electron charge, and decreased the isoelectric point (IEP) value of the solid particles. In addition, about 25% of the proteins in the rice washing drainage still remained after enzyme treatment. Moreover, due to the enzyme treatment, specific and gradual degradations of 10, 13, and 16kDa of prolamin and 20-22kDa of gluterin basic subunit, both categorized in the basic protein group, were observed in an SDS-PAGE analysis. These results suggest that the flocculation and sedimentation of solid particles in rice washing drainage occur as a result of the formation of the IEP-dependent strengthening of the negative surface electron charge on the solid particle surface.
21385782	Analyses of phylogeny, evolution, conserved sequences and genome-wide expression of the ICK/KRP family of plant CDK inhibitors.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cell cycle is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors are major regulators of their activities. The ICK/KRP family of CDK inhibitors has been reported in several plants, with seven members in arabidopsis; however, the phylogenetic relationship among members in different species is unknown. Also, there is a need to understand how these genes and proteins are regulated. Furthermore, little information is available on the functional differences among ICK/KRP family members.

METHODS: We searched publicly available databases and identified over 120 unique ICK/KRP protein sequences from more than 60 plant species. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 101 full-length sequences from 40 species and intron-exon organization of ICK/KRP genes in model species. Conserved sequences and motifs were analysed using ICK/KRP protein sequences from arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). In addition, gene expression was examined using microarray data from arabidopsis, rice and poplar, and further analysed by RT-PCR for arabidopsis.

KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis showed that plant ICK/KRP proteins can be grouped into three major classes. Whereas the C-class contains sequences from dicotyledons, monocotyledons and gymnosperms, the A- and B-classes contain only sequences from dicotyledons or monocotyledons, respectively, suggesting that the A- and B-classes might have evolved from the C-class. This classification is also supported by exon-intron organization. Genes in the A- and B- classes have four exons, whereas genes in the C-class have only three exons. Analysis of sequences from arabidopsis, rice and poplar identified conserved sequence motifs, some of which had not been described previously, and putative functional sites. The presence of conserved motifs in different family members is consistent with the classification. In addition, gene expression analysis showed preferential expression of ICK/KRP genes in certain tissues. A model has been proposed for the evolution of this gene family in plants.
21554676	Analysis of anther transcriptomes to identify genes contributing to meiosis and male gametophyte development in rice.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: In flowering plants, the anther is the site of male gametophyte development. Two major events in the development of the male germline are meiosis and the asymmetric division in the male gametophyte that gives rise to the vegetative and generative cells, and the following mitotic division in the generative cell that produces two sperm cells. Anther transcriptomes have been analyzed in many plant species at progressive stages of development by using microarray and sequence-by synthesis-technologies to identify genes that regulate anther development. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of rice anther transcriptomes at four distinct stages, focusing on identifying regulatory components that contribute to male meiosis and germline development. Further, these transcriptomes have been compared with the transcriptomes of 10 stages of rice vegetative and seed development to identify genes that express specifically during anther development.

RESULTS: Transcriptome profiling of four stages of anther development in rice including pre-meiotic (PMA), meiotic (MA), anthers at single-celled (SCP) and tri-nucleate pollen (TPA) revealed about 22,000 genes expressing in at least one of the anther developmental stages, with the highest number in MA (18,090) and the lowest (15,465) in TPA. Comparison of these transcriptome profiles to an in-house generated microarray-based transcriptomics database comprising of 10 stages/tissues of vegetative as well as reproductive development in rice resulted in the identification of 1,000 genes specifically expressed in anther stages. From this sub-set, 453 genes were specific to TPA, while 78 and 184 genes were expressed specifically in MA and SCP, respectively. The expression pattern of selected genes has been validated using real time PCR and in situ hybridizations. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of stage-specific genes revealed that those encoding transcription factors and components of protein folding, sorting and degradation pathway genes dominated in MA, whereas in TPA, those coding for cell structure and signal transduction components were in abundance. Interestingly, about 50% of the genes with anther-specific expression have not been annotated so far.

CONCLUSIONS: Not only have we provided the transcriptome constituents of four landmark stages of anther development in rice but we have also identified genes that express exclusively in these stages. It is likely that many of these candidates may therefore contribute to specific aspects of anther and/or male gametophyte development in rice. In addition, the gene sets that have been produced will assist the plant reproductive community in building a deeper understanding of underlying regulatory networks and in selecting gene candidates for functional validation.
21394874	Development and characterisation of transgenic rice expressing two Bacillus thuringiensis genes.	2011	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) were first commercialised in 1996. The risk that pests have the potential to evolve resistance to Bt toxins is one of the most serious challenges to this technology. Gene stacking, pyramiding two Bt genes into one variety, is considered to be an effective insect resistance management (IRM) strategy. In this study, insect-resistant rice expressing two Bt genes was developed by sexual crossing, and then characterised.

RESULTS: Homozygous rice lines of two pyramided Bt genes were obtained in the F(3) generation. Quantification of Bt toxin showed that protein concentrations of Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry2A in the two-gene lines were comparable with their single-gene parents, while the expression of cry1C gene decreased after gene stacking. Four two-gene lines showed higher activity to striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis Walker) than parental lines in the laboratory bioassay. All pyramided lines and their hybrids exhibited excellent efficacy against stemborers and leaffolders in field evaluation, while most pyramided lines had no significant differences from original variety in yield under spraying of insecticide.

CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the two-gene lines have commercial potential and could serve as a valuable IRM strategy.
21688039	Over expression of rice chitinase gene in transgenic peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) improves resistance against leaf spot.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	A Rice chitinase-3 under enhance version of CaMV 35S was introduced into peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) through Agrobacterium mediation. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LB4404 was used harboring the binary vector (pB1333-EN4-RCG3) containing the chitinase (chit) and hygromycin resistance (hpt) gene as selectable marker. Putative transgenic shoots were regenerated and grown on MS medium supplemented with 5 mg/l BAP, 1 mg/l kinetin, and 30 mg/l hygromycin. Elongated shoots were examined for the presence of the integrated rice chitinase gene along with hygromycin gene as selectable. The integration pattern of transgene in the nuclear genome of the putative transformed plants (T(0)) was confirmed through Southern hybridization analysis of the genomic DNA. Survival rate of the in vitro regenerated plantlets was over 60% while healthy putatively transgenic (T(0)) plants with over 42% transformation frequency were produced through Agrobacterium mediated gene transfer of the rice chitinase gene and all the plants flowered and set seed normally. T1 plants were tested for resistance against Cercospora arachidicola by infection with the microspores. Transgenic strains exhibited a higher resistance than the control (non-transgenic plants). chitinase gene expression in highly resistant transgenic strains was compared to that of a susceptible control. A good correlation was observed between chitinase activity and fungal pathogen resistance.
21368906	Chemolithotrophic acetogenic H2/CO2 utilization in Italian rice field soil.	2011	ISME J	Acetate oxidation in Italian rice field at 50 °C is achieved by uncultured syntrophic acetate oxidizers. As these bacteria are closely related to acetogens, they may potentially also be able to synthesize acetate chemolithoautotrophically. Labeling studies using exogenous H(2) (80%) and (13)CO(2) (20%), indeed demonstrated production of acetate as almost exclusive primary product not only at 50 °C but also at 15 °C. Small amounts of formate, propionate and butyrate were also produced from (13)CO(2). At 50 °C, acetate was first produced but later on consumed with formation of CH(4). Acetate was also produced in the absence of exogenous H(2) albeit to lower concentrations. The acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea were targeted by stable isotope probing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Using quantitative PCR, (13)C-labeled bacterial rRNA was detected after 20 days of incubation with (13)CO(2). In the heavy fractions at 15 °C, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA showed that Clostridium cluster I and uncultured Peptococcaceae assimilated (13)CO(2) in the presence and absence of exogenous H(2), respectively. A similar experiment showed that Thermoanaerobacteriaceae and Acidobacteriaceae were dominant in the (13)C treatment at 50 °C. Assimilation of (13)CO(2) into archaeal rRNA was detected at 15 °C and 50 °C, mostly into Methanocellales, Methanobacteriales and rice cluster III. Acetoclastic methanogenic archaea were not detected. The above results showed the potential for acetogenesis in the presence and absence of exogenous H(2) at both 15 °C and 50 °C. However, syntrophic acetate oxidizers seemed to be only active at 50 °C, while other bacterial groups were active at 15 °C.
21741417	Direct ethanol production from hemicellulosic materials of rice straw by use of an engineered yeast strain codisplaying three types of hemicellulolytic enzymes on the surface of xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.	2012	J Biotechnol	The cost of the lignocellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes used in the saccharification process of ethanol production from biomass accounts for a relatively high proportion of total processing costs. Cell surface engineering technology has facilitated a reduction in these costs by integrating saccharification and fermentation processes into a recombinant microbe strain expressing heterologous enzymes on the cell surface. We constructed a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae that not only hydrolyzed hemicelluloses by codisplaying endoxylanase from Trichoderma reesei, β-xylosidase from Aspergillus oryzae, and β-glucosidase from Aspergillus aculeatus but that also assimilated xylose through the expression of xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from Pichia stipitis and xylulokinase from S. cerevisiae. The recombinant strain successfully produced ethanol from rice straw hydrolysate consisting of hemicellulosic material containing xylan, xylooligosaccharides, and cellooligosaccharides without requiring the addition of sugar-hydrolyzing enzymes or detoxication. The ethanol titer of the strain was 8.2g/l after 72h fermentation, which was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of the control strain. The yield (grams of ethanol per gram of total sugars in rice straw hydrolysate consumed) was 0.41g/g, which corresponded to 82% of the theoretical yield. The cell surface-engineered strain was thus highly effective for consolidating the process of ethanol production from hemicellulosic materials.
21701860	Magnaporthe oryzae populations adapted to finger millet and rice exhibit distinctive patterns of genetic diversity, sexuality and host interaction.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	In this study, host-specific forms of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were characterised from distinct cropping locations using a combination of molecular and biological assays. Finger millet blast populations in East Africa revealed a continuous genetic variation pattern and lack of clonal lineages, with a wide range of haplotypes. M. oryzae populations lacked the grasshopper (grh) element (96%) and appeared distinct to those in Asia. An overall near equal distribution (47-53%) of the mating types MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, high fertility status (84-89%) and the dominance of hermaphrodites (64%) suggest a strong sexual reproductive potential. Differences in pathogen aggressiveness and lack of cultivar incompatibility suggest the importance of quantitative resistance. Rice blast populations in West Africa showed a typical lineage-based structure. Among the nine lineages identified, three comprised ~90% of the isolates. Skewed distribution of the mating types MAT1-1 (29%) and MAT1-2 (71%) was accompanied by low fertility. Clear differences in cultivar compatibility within and between lineages suggest R gene-mediated interactions. Distinctive patterns of genetic diversity, sexual reproductive potential and pathogenicity suggest adaptive divergence of host-specific forms of M. oryzae populations linked to crop domestication and agricultural intensification.
21281657	Oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs) and their encoding genes in Arabidopsis and rice.	2011	Steroids	Cell wall deposition, biosynthesis of steroid hormones, and maintenance of membrane composition and integrity, are some of the crucial functions of sterols in plants. Followed by their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, the sterols accumulate in the plasma membrane. The concept of sterol trafficking in plant cell is not well understood. The oxysterol binding proteins are implicated in sterol transport in non-plant systems. In the study, the oxysterol binding proteins in Arabidopsis and rice are described and classified. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 12 oxysterol binding proteins-related proteins (ORPs) as compared to 6 oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs/ORPs) in rice. The protein alignment studies reveal that amino acid sequences for oxysterol binding proteins are relatively well conserved in Arabidopsis and rice. The rice OSBPs are classified based on their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis ORPs. The sequence LOGO built on LOC_Os03g16690 indicated presence of fingerprint region of amino acids "EQVSHHPP" for Arabidopsis and rice OSBPs/ORPs. The organization of pleckstrin homology domain is identified in several OSBPs/ORPs in Arabidopsis and rice. The Arabidopsis oligonucleotide array data is explored to understand the expression patterns of ORPs under 17 different experimental conditions. The analysis showed the expression of ORPs in Arabidopsis is necessarily under the control of biotic stress, chemical, elicitor, hormone, light intensity, abiotic stress, and temperature conditions. The linear mean signal values for Arabidopsis ORPs revealed their relative expression patterns in different developmental stages. The genes for ORP3C and ORP3B are highly expressed in all developmental stages that were analyzed. The present study thus indicates crucial functional role of the individual members of this gene family in different environmental stress conditions.
21565701	Structure-function analysis of a CVNH-LysM lectin expressed during plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2011	Structure	The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae's genome encodes a hypothetical protein (MGG_03307) containing a type III CVNH lectin, in which a LysM domain is inserted between individual repeats of a single CVNH domain. At present, no structural or ligand binding data are available for any type III CVNH and functional studies in natural source organisms are scarce. Here, we report NMR solution structure and functional data on MGG_03307. The structure of the CVNH/LysM module revealed that intact and functionally competent CVNH and LysM domains are present. Using NMR titrations, carbohydrate specificities for both domains were determined, and it was found that each domain behaves as an isolated unit without any interdomain communication. Furthermore, live-cell imaging revealed a predominant localization of MGG_03307 within the appressorium, the specialized fungal cell for gaining entry into rice tissue. Our results suggest that MGG_03307 plays a role in the early stages of plant infection.
21040387	Targeting specific genes for RNA interference is crucial to the development of strong resistance to rice stripe virus.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice stripe virus (RSV) has a serious negative effect on rice production in temperate regions of East Asia. Focusing on the putative importance of the selection of target sequences for RNA interference (RNAi), we analysed the effects of potential target sequences in each of the coding genes in the RSV genome, using transgenic rice plants that expressed a set of inverted-repeat (IR) constructs. The reactions of inoculated transgenic T(1) plants to RSV were divided subjectively into three classes, namely highly resistant, moderately resistant and lacking enhanced resistance to RSV, even though plants that harboured any constructs accumulated transgene-specific siRNAs prior to inoculation with RSV. Transgenic plants that harboured IR constructs specific for the gene for pC3, which encodes nucleocapsid protein, and for pC4, which encodes a viral movement protein, were immune to infection by RSV and were more resistant to infection than the natural resistant cultivars that have been used to control the disease in the field. By contrast, the IR construct specific for the gene for pC2, which encodes a glycoprotein of unknown function, and for p4, which encodes a major non-structural protein of unknown function, did not result in resistance. Our results indicate that not all RNAi constructs against viral RNAs are equally effective in preventing RSV infection and that it is important to identify the viral 'Achilles heel' for RNAi attack in the engineering of plants.
21525786	Genome-wide discovery and analysis of microRNAs and other small RNAs from rice embryogenic callus.	None	RNA Biol	Small RNAs constitute a new and unanticipated layer of gene regulation present in the three domains of life. In plants, all organs are ultimately derived from a few pluripotent stem cells localized in specialized structures called apical meristems. The development of meristems involves a coordinated balance between undifferentiated growth and differentiation, a phenomenon requiring a tight regulation of gene expression. We used in vitro cultured embryogenic calli as a model to investigate the roles of meristem-associated small RNAs. Using high throughput sequencing, we sequenced 20 million short reads with size of 18-30 nt from rice undifferentiated and differentiated calli. We confirmed 50 known microRNA families, representing one third of annotated rice microRNAs. Using a specific computational pipeline for plant microRNA identification, we identified 24 novel microRNA families. Among them, 53 microRNA or microRNA* sequences appear to vary in expression between differentiated and undifferentiated calli, suggesting a role in meristem development. Our analysis also revealed a new class of plant small RNAs derived from 5' or 3' ends of mature tRNA analogous to the tRFs in human cancer cell. We independently verified the expression of these small RNAs from 5' end of mature tRNA using qRT-PCR.
21725029	OsWRKY45 alleles play different roles in abscisic acid signalling and salt stress tolerance but similar roles in drought and cold tolerance in rice.	2011	J Exp Bot	Although allelic diversity of genes has been shown to contribute to many phenotypic variations associated with different physiological processes in plants, information on allelic diversity of abiotic stress-responsive genes is limited. Here it is shown that the alleles OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 play different roles in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and salt stress adaptation in rice. The two alleles had different transcriptional responses to ABA and salt stresses. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY45-1-knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity. OsWRKY45-1 transgenic plants showed no obvious difference from negative controls in response to salt stress. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance. OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 transgenic plants showed differential expression of a set of ABA- and abiotic stress-responsive genes, but they showed similar responses to cold and drought stresses. These results suggest that OsWRKY45-1 negatively and OsWRKY45-2 positively regulates ABA signalling and, in addition, OsWRKY45-2 but not OsWRKY45-1 negatively regulates rice response to salt stress. The different roles of the two alleles in ABA signalling and salt stress may be due to their transcriptional mediation of different signalling pathways.
21922807	[Observation for CH4 and N2O emissions under different rates of nitrogen and phosphate fertilization in double rice fields].	2011	Huan Jing Ke Xue	Two non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) and related environmental factors were measured within rice growing season under five treatments including non-fertilization (CK), balanced fertilization (BF), decreased nitrogen and phosphate 1 (DNP1), decreased nitrogen and phosphate 2 (DNP2) and increased nitrogen and phosphate 1 (INP) in double rice fields of red clay soil in 2009, using the method of static chamber-gas chromatograph techniques. The results showed that the average CH4 emission fluxes for treatments of BF, DNP1, DNP2 and INP were 4.57, 5.42, 4.70 and 4.65 mg x (m2 x h)(-1) during early rice growing period, which increased by 39%, 49%, 41% and 40% compared with non-fertilizer treatment, respectively. The average CH4 emission fluxes in late rice growing season was higher than preseason's. Compared to CK, CH4 emission increased by 11%, 1%, 26% and - 4% in treatments of BF, DNP1, DNP2 and INP within late rice growing season. Applying nitrogen and phosphate enhanced CH4 emission in turning green period for early and late rice. No significant difference was observed between the CH4 emissions of five treatments during early and late rice growing season (p > 0.05). N2O emission was very little during mid-seasonal drainage period. In contrast, N2O emission peaks were observed in period of alternation of wetting and drying after mid-seasonal drainage in this experiment. N2O emission was, on average, equivalent to 0.18% of the nitrogen applied in double rice growing season. Statistically, air temperature, soil Eh and soil moisture (water-filled pore space, WFPS) at 0-10cm depth significantly affected the fluctuations of the seasonal CH4 flux, but no significant correlationship has been found between N2O flux and related environmental factors. CH4 was the dominated greenhouse gas in double rice fields which contributed approximately 90% for the integrated global warming potential of CH4 and N2O released during the rice growing season. Therefore, the mitigation options should focus on how to reduce CH4 emission in local area. The result indicates that BF is a recommended fertilization method for early rice production, and a optimum fertilization for late season can increase rates of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers on the basis of BF treatment slightly by considering total global warming potential and grain yield. The rates of BF treatment were 150-90-90 kg x hm(-2) N-P2O5-K2O for early rice, and 180-90-135 kg x hm(-2) N-P2O5-K2O for late rice, respectively.
21725856	Analysis of transcriptional and upstream regulatory sequence activity of two environmental stress-inducible genes, NBS-Str1 and BLEC-Str8, of rice.	2012	Transgenic Res	Two abiotic stress-inducible upstream regulatory sequences (URSs) from rice have been identified and functionally characterized in rice. NBS-Str1 and BLEC-Str8 genes have been identified, by analysing the transcriptome data of cold, salt and desiccation stress-treated 7-day-old rice (Oryza sativa L. var. IR64) seedling, to be preferentially responsive to desiccation and salt stress, respectively. NBS-Str1 and BLEC-Str8 genes code for putative NBS (nucleotide binding site)-LRR (leucine rich repeat) and β-lectin domain protein, respectively. NBS-Str1 URS is induced in root tissue, preferentially in vascular bundle, during 3 and 24 h of desiccation stress condition in transgenic 7-day-old rice seedling. In mature transgenic plants, this URS shows induction in root and shoot tissue under desiccation stress as well as under prolonged (1 and 2 day) salt stress. BLEC-Str8 URS shows basal activity under un-stressed condition, however, it is inducible under salt stress condition in both root and leaf tissues in young seedling and mature plants. Activity of BLEC-Str8 URS has been found to be vascular tissue preferential, however, under salt stress condition its activity is also found in the mesophyll tissue. NBS-Str1 and BLEC-Str8 URSs are inducible by heavy metal, copper and manganese. Interestingly, both the URSs have been found to be non responsive to ABA treatment, implying them to be part of ABA-independent abiotic stress response pathway. These URSs could prove useful for expressing a transgene in a stress responsive manner for development of stress tolerant transgenic systems.
21750695	Increased fitness of rice plants to abiotic stress via habitat adapted symbiosis: a strategy for mitigating impacts of climate change.	2011	PLoS One	Climate change and catastrophic events have contributed to rice shortages in several regions due to decreased water availability and soil salinization. Although not adapted to salt or drought stress, two commercial rice varieties achieved tolerance to these stresses by colonizing them with Class 2 fungal endophytes isolated from plants growing across moisture and salinity gradients.Plant growth and development, water usage, ROS sensitivity and osmolytes were measured with and without stress under controlled conditions.The endophytes conferred salt, drought and cold tolerance to growth chamber and greenhouse grown plants. Endophytes reduced water consumption by 20-30% and increased growth rate, reproductive yield, and biomass of greenhouse grown plants. In the absence of stress, there was no apparent cost of the endophytes to plants, however, endophyte colonization decreased from 100% at planting to 65% compared to greenhouse plants grown under continual stress (maintained 100% colonization).These findings indicate that rice plants can exhibit enhanced stress tolerance via symbiosis with Class 2 endophytes, and suggest that symbiotic technology may be useful in mitigating impacts of climate change on other crops and expanding agricultural production onto marginal lands.
21802967	QM/MM studies on the glycosylation mechanism of rice BGlu1 β-glucosidase.	2011	J Mol Graph Model	The quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) method was used to study the glycosylation mechanism of rice BGlu1 β-glucosidase in complex with laminaribiose. The calculation results reveal that the glycosylation step experiences a concerted process from the reactant to the glycosyl-enzyme complex with an activation barrier of 15.7 kcal/mol, in which an oxocarbenium cation-like transition state (TS) is formed. At the TS, the terminal saccharide residue planarizes toward the half-chair conformation, and the glycosidic bond cleavage is promoted by the attacks of proton donor (E176) on glycosidic oxygen and nucleophilic residue (E386) on the anomeric carbon of laminaribiose. Both the nucleophilic glutamate (E386) and acid/base catalyst (E176) establish shorter hydrogen bridges with the C₂-hydroxyl groups of sugar ring, which play an important role in the catalytic reaction of rice BGlu1 β-glucosidase.
21869469	Quantitative trait loci for rice yield-related traits using recombinant inbred lines derived from two diverse cultivars.	2011	J Genet	The thousand-grain weight and spikelets per panicle directly contribute to rice yield. Heading date and plant height also greatly influence the yield. Dissection of genetic bases of yield-related traits would provide tools for yield improvement. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for spikelets per panicle, thousand-grain weight, heading date and plant height was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two diverse cultivars, Nanyangzhan and Chuan7. In total, 20 QTLs were identified for four traits. They were located to 11 chromosomes except on chromosome 4. Seven and five QTLs were detected for thousand-grain weight and spikelets per panicle, respectively. Four QTLs were identified for both heading date and plant height. About half the QTLs were commonly detected in both years, 2006 and 2007. Six QTLs are being reported for the first time. Two QTL clusters were identified in regions flanked by RM22065 and RM5720 on chromosome 7 and by RM502 and RM264 on chromosome 8, respectively. The parent, Nanyangzhan with heavy thousand-grain weight, carried alleles with increased effects on all seven thousand-grain weight QTL, which explained why there was no transgressive segregation for thousand-grain weight in the population. In contrast, Chuan7 with more spikelets per panicle carried positive alleles at all five spikelets per panicle QTL except qspp5. Further work on distinction between pleiotropic QTL and linked QTL is needed in two yield-related QTL clusters.
21933130	Identification of heterotrimeric G protein α and β subunits in rice.	2012	Protein Pept Lett	Like those in mammals, heterotrimeric G protein complexes have been implicated in signal transduction pathways in plants; however, the subunits themselves have not been isolated. In this study, the rice heterotrimeric G protein subunits α (Gα) and β (Gβ) were purified by affinity chromatography using anti-Gα and -Gβ antibodies and SDS-PAGE. Six and seven peptides, respectively, were identified by mass spectrometry and identified as the translation products of the Gα gene RGA1 and Gβ gene RGB1. During purification, the subunits dissociated easily from the G protein complex.
21887580	Transcriptional dynamics during cell wall removal and regeneration reveals key genes involved in cell wall development in rice.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Efficient and cost-effective conversion of plant biomass to usable forms of energy requires a thorough understanding of cell wall biosynthesis, modification and degradation. To elucidate these processes, we assessed the expression dynamics during enzymatic removal and regeneration of rice cell walls in suspension cells over time. In total, 928 genes exhibited significant up-regulation during cell wall removal, whereas, 79 genes were up-regulated during cell wall regeneration. Both gene sets are enriched for kinases, transcription factors and genes predicted to be involved in cell wall-related functions. Integration of the gene expression datasets with a catalog of known and/or predicted biochemical pathways from rice, revealed metabolic and hormonal pathways involved in cell wall degradation and regeneration. Rice lines carrying Tos17 mutations in genes up-regulated during cell wall removal exhibit dwarf phenotypes. Many of the genes up-regulated during cell wall development are also up-regulated in response to infection and environmental perturbations indicating a coordinated response to diverse types of stress.
21949821	Movement protein Pns6 of rice dwarf phytoreovirus has both ATPase and RNA binding activities.	2011	PLoS One	Cell-to-cell movement is essential for plant viruses to systemically infect host plants. Plant viruses encode movement proteins (MP) to facilitate such movement. Unlike the well-characterized MPs of DNA viruses and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, knowledge of the functional mechanisms of MPs encoded by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses is very limited. In particular, many studied MPs of DNA and ssRNA viruses bind non-specifically ssRNAs, leading to models in which ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) move from cell to cell. Thus, it will be of special interest to determine whether MPs of dsRNA viruses interact with genomic dsRNAs or their derivative sRNAs. To this end, we studied the biochemical functions of MP Pns6 of Rice dwarf phytoreovirus (RDV), a member of Phytoreovirus that contains a 12-segmented dsRNA genome. We report here that Pns6 binds both dsRNAs and ssRNAs. Intriguingly, Pns6 exhibits non-sequence specificity for dsRNA but shows preference for ssRNA sequences derived from the conserved genomic 5'- and 3'-terminal consensus sequences of RDV. Furthermore, Pns6 exhibits magnesium-dependent ATPase activities. Mutagenesis identified the RNA binding and ATPase activity sites of Pns6 at the N- and C-termini, respectively. Our results uncovered the novel property of a viral MP in differentially recognizing dsRNA and ssRNA and establish a biochemical basis to enable further studies on the mechanisms of dsRNA viral MP functions.
21930802	Ortholog alleles at Xa3/Xa26 locus confer conserved race-specific resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in rice.	2012	Mol Plant	The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa3/Xa26 (having also been named Xa3 and Xa26) against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight disease, belongs to a multiple gene family clustered in chromosome 11 and is from an AA genome rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.). This family encodes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type proteins. Here, we show that the orthologs (alleles) of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3, from wild Oryza species O. officinalis (CC genome) and O. minuta (BBCC genome), respectively, were also R genes against Xoo. Xa3/Xa26-2 and Xa3/Xa26-3 conferred resistance to 16 of the 18 Xoo strains examined. Comparative sequence analysis of the Xa3/Xa26 families in the two wild Oryza species showed that Xa3/Xa26-3 appeared to have originated from the CC genome of O. minuta. The predicted proteins encoded by Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3 share 91-99% sequence identity and 94-99% sequence similarity. Transgenic plants carrying a single copy of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, or Xa3/Xa26-3, in the same genetic background, showed a similar resistance spectrum to a set of Xoo strains, although plants carrying Xa3/Xa26-2 or Xa3/Xa26-3 showed lower resistance levels than the plants carrying Xa3/Xa26. These results suggest that the Xa3/Xa26 locus predates the speciation of A and C genome, which is approximately 7.5 million years ago. Thus, the resistance specificity of this locus has been conserved for a long time.
21977025	Differential expression of three flavanone 3-hydroxylase genes in grains and coleoptiles of wheat.	2011	Int J Plant Genomics	Flavonoid pigments are known to accumulate in red grains and coleoptiles of wheat and are synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) is a key enzyme at a diverging point of the flavonoid pathway leading to production of different pigments: phlobaphene, proanthocyanidin, and anthocyanin. We isolated three F3H genes from wheat and examined a relationship between their expression and tissue pigmentation. Three F3Hs are located on the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D, respectively, designated as F3H-A1, F3H-B1, and F3H-D1. The telomeric regions of the long arms of the chromosomes of homoeologous group 2 of wheat showed a syntenic relationship to the telomeric region of the long arm of rice chromosome 4, on which rice F3H gene was also located. All three genes were highly activated in the red grains and coleoptiles and appeared to be controlled by flavonoid regulators in each tissue.
21912860	Teosinte Branched 1 modulates tillering in rice plants.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Tillering is an important trait of cereal crops that optimizes plant architecture for maximum yield. Teosinte Branched 1 (TB1) is a negative regulator of lateral branching and an inducer of female inflorescence formation in Zea mays (maize). Recent studies indicate that TB1 homologs in Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor and Arabidopsis thaliana act downstream of the auxin and MORE AUXILIARY GROWTH (MAX) pathways. However, the molecular mechanism by which rice produces tillers remains unknown. In this study, transgenic rice plants were produced that overexpress the maize TB1 (mTB1) or rice TB1 (OsTB1) genes and silence the OsTB1 gene through RNAi-mediated knockdown. Because lateral branching in rice is affected by the environmental conditions, the phenotypes of transgenic plants were observed in both the greenhouse and the paddy field. Compared to wild-type plants, the number of tillers and panicles was reduced and increased in overexpressed and RNAi-mediated knockdown OsTB1 rice plants, respectively, under both environmental conditions. However, the effect was small for plants grown in paddy fields. These results demonstrate that both mTB1 and OsTB1 moderately regulate the tiller development in rice.
21926092	RNAi-mediated disruption of squalene synthase improves drought tolerance and yield in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	About one-third of the world's rice area is in rain-fed lowlands and most are prone to water shortage. The identification of genes imparting tolerance to drought in the model cereal plant, rice, is an attractive strategy to engineer improved drought tolerance not only rice but other cereals as well. It is demonstrated that RNAi-mediated disruption of a rice farnesyltransferase/squalene synthase (SQS) by maize squalene synthase improves drought tolerance at both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Twenty-day-old seedlings of wild type (Nipponbare) and seven independent events of transgenic RNAi lines showed no difference in morphology. When subjected to water stress for a period of 32 d under growth chamber conditions, transgenic positives showed delayed wilting, conserved more soil water, and improved recovery. When five independent events along with wild-type plants were subjected to drought at the reproductive stage under greenhouse conditions, the transgenic plants lost water more slowly compared with the wild type, through reduced stomatal conductance and the retention of high leaf relative water content (RWC). After 28 d of slow progressive soil drying, transgenic plants recovered better and flowered earlier than wild-type plants. The yield of water-stressed transgenic positive plants ranged from 14-39% higher than wild-type plants. When grown in plates with Yoshida's nutrient solution with 1.2% agar, transgenic positives from three independent events showed increased root length and an enhanced number of lateral roots. The RNAi-mediated inactivation produced reduced stomatal conductance and subsequent drought tolerance.
21078052	Antihypertensive activity of transgenic rice seed containing an 18-repeat novokinin peptide localized in the nucleolus of endosperm cells.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Novokinin (Arg-Pro-Leu-Lys-Pro-Trp, RPLKPW) is a new potent antihypertensive peptide based on the sequence of ovokinin (2-7) derived from ovalbumin. We previously generated transgenic rice seeds in which eight novokinin were fused to storage protein glutelins (GluA2 and GluC) for expression. Oral administration of these seeds to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) reduced systolic blood pressures at a dose of 1 g seed/kg of SHR. Here, 10- or 18-tandem repeats of novokinin with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, KDEL) at the C terminus were directly expressed in rice under the control of the glutelin promoter containing its signal peptide. Only small amounts of the 18-repeat novokinin accumulated, and it was unexpectedly deposited in the nucleolus. This abnormal intracellular localization was explained by an endogenous signal for nuclear localization. The GFP reporter protein fused to this sequence targeted to nuclei by a transient assay using onion epidermal cells. Transgenic seed expressing the 18-repeat novokinin exhibited significantly higher antihypertensive activity after a single oral dose to SHR even at one-quarter the amount (0.25 g/kg) of the transgenic rice seed expressing the fusion construct; though, its novokinin content was much lower (1/5). Furthermore, in a long-term administration for 5 weeks, even a smaller dose (0.0625 g/kg) of transgenic seeds could confer antihypertensive activity. This high antihypertensive activity may be attributed to differences in digestibility of expressed products by gastrointestinal enzymes and the unique intracellular localization. These results indicate that accumulation of novokinin as a tandemly repeated structure in transgenic rice is more effective than as a fusion-type structure.
21641919	Cytotoxic steroids from Monascus purpureus-fermented rice.	None	Steroids	Bioassay-guided fractionation of an EtOH extract of Monascus purpureus-fermented rice led to the isolation of two new steroids (22S, 23R, 24S)-20β,23α,25α-trihydroxy-16,22-epoxy-4,6,8(14)-trienergosta-3-one (1), the first example of a steroid possessing both a conjugated triene ketone system and a fused 4H-furan ring side chain within one molecule, and (22E, 24R)-3β,5α-dihydroxyergosta-23-methyl-7,22-dien-6-one (2), as well as two known compounds (22E, 24R)-3β,5α-dihydroxyergosta-7,22-dien-6-one (3) and (22E, 24R)-6β-methoxy-ergosta-7,22-diene-3β,5α-diol (4). Their structures were assigned by detailed interpretation of HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography while the absolute stereochemistry of 2 was established by CD. Compounds 1-4 showed cytotoxic activity against the lung adenocarcinoma (A549) with IC(50) values of 0.08, 0.94, 12.6 and 13.5 μM, respectively. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate activities against human ovarian cancer (A2780), with IC(50) values of 2.8 and 5.1 μM.
21912852	Evaluation of seed storage protein gene 3'-untranslated regions in enhancing gene expression in transgenic rice seed.	2012	Transgenic Res	3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are important sequence elements that modulate the expression of genes. We evaluated the potential of the 3'-UTRs of 9 seed storage protein (SSP) genes as terminators in enhancing the expression of the β-glucuronidase (gus A) reporter gene driven by the glutelin GluB-3 promoter in stable transgenic rice lines. Six of the 3'-UTRs significantly enhanced the activity of the GluB-3 promoter without changing its tissue specificity but altered its expression pattern in endosperm. With the 3'-UTRs of GluB-5, GluA-2 and GluC, the expression of gus A was higher by 3.12-, 2.45- and 2.14-fold, respectively, than with the Nos terminator. These three 3'-UTRs, combined with GluC, Ubi-1 and CaMV35S promoters, also increased GUS levels in stable transgenic rice lines or in transient expression in protoplasts, which indicated that the enhancements were independent of the promoter sequence. The increase in protein production was accompanied by altered mRNA levels, which suggests that the enhancements were due to increased transcript level. The 3'-UTRs of GluB-5, GluA-2 and GluC, when combined with strong promoters, might be ideal candidates for high production of recombinant proteins in rice seeds. The 9 SSP 3'-UTRs could function as faithful terminators in mono- or multi-gene transformation avoiding homology-based gene silencing.
21926094	Post-anthesis alternate wetting and moderate soil drying enhances activities of key enzymes in sucrose-to-starch conversion in inferior spikelets of rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	This study tested the hypothesis that a post-anthesis moderate soil drying can improve grain filling through regulating the key enzymes in the sucrose-to-starch pathway in the grains of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two rice cultivars were field grown and two irrigation regimes, alternate wetting and moderate soil drying (WMD) and conventional irrigation (CI, continuously flooded), were imposed during the grain-filling period. The grain-filling rate and activities of four key enzymes in sucrose-to-starch conversion, sucrose synthase (SuSase), adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase (StSase), and starch branching enzyme (SBE), showed no significant difference between WMD and CI regimes for the earlier flowering superior spikelets. However, they were significantly enhanced by the WMD for the later flowering inferior spikelets. The activities of both soluble and insoluble acid invertase in the grains were little affected by the WMD. The two cultivars showed the same tendencies. The activities of SuSase, AGPase, StSase, and SBE in grains were very significantly correlated with the grain-filling rate. The abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in inferior spikelets was remarkably increased in the WMD and very significantly correlated with activities of SuSase, AGPase, StSase, and SBE. Application of ABA on plants under CI produced similar results to those seen in plants receiving WMD. Applying fluridone, an indirect inhibitor of ABA synthesis, produced the opposite effect. The results suggest that post-anthesis WMD could enhance sink strength by regulating the key enzymes involved, and consequently, increase the grain-filling rate and grain weight of inferior spikelets. ABA plays an important role in this process.
21114612	Generation of chimeric repressors that confer salt tolerance in Arabidopsis and rice.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	We show here that transgenic Arabidopsis plants that expressed chimeric repressors derived from the AtMYB102, ANAC047, HRS1, ZAT6 and AtERF5 transcription factors were tolerant to treatment with 400 mm NaCl, which was lethal to wild-type plants. The transgenic plants grew well, without any apparent differences from the wild-type plants under normal growth condition. The transgenic lines expressing the AtMYB102, ANAC047 and HRS1 chimeric repressors germinated in the presence of 225 mm NaCl, while those expressing the ZAT6 and AtERF5 did not. However, the latter lines were tolerant to osmotic stress and germinated in the presence of 600 mm mannitol, suggesting a link between responses to salt and osmotic stress. Expression of the AtMYB102, ANAC047, ZAT6 and AtERF5 genes was induced by salt treatment, while that of HRS1 was repressed. HRS1 has transcriptional repressive activity and appears to suppress the expression of factors that negatively regulate salt tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed that the levels of expression of DREB1A, DREB2B and several genes for ZAT transcription factors rose 10- to 100-fold in the AtMYB102 chimeric repressor line under both normal and stress conditions. Elevated expression of DREB- and ZAT- related genes might be involved in the salt tolerance of the AtMYB102 chimeric repressor line. Transgenic rice plants expressing chimeric repressors derived from Os02g0325600 and Os03g0327800, rice homologues of HRS1 and ANAC047, were tolerant to salinity stress demonstrated by suppression of growth inhibition and ion leakages. Expression of a chimeric repressor provides an effective strategy for enhancing tolerance of plants to abiotic stress.
21911595	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Although phyAphyBphyC phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation. A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyBphyC seedlings. ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by phyA and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of phyAphyBphyC seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted. In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyBphyC mutants. We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects. These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation.
21978604	Expression and purification of soluble bio-active rice plant catalase-A from recombinant Escherichia coli.	2012	J Biotechnol	Catalase in plants is a heme-coordinated tetrameric protein that primarily disproportionates hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It plays an important role in maintaining cellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide to a level, necessary for all aspects of normal plant growth and development. Except for its recombinant expression in transgenic plants and insect cell line, the protein is yet to be synthesized in its bio-active form in prokaryotic expression system. Attempts made in past for recombinant expression of plant catalase in Escherichia coli consistently resulted in formation of insoluble and inactive aggregates of inclusion body. Here we have shown the specific requirement of a thioredoxin fusion partner, the involvement of trigger factor protein and the low temperature treatment during induction period for synthesis of completely solubilized rice plant catalase-A in recombinant E. coli. Furthermore, the bacteria required the supplementation of δ-aminolevulinic acid to produce bio-active recombinant rice catalase-A. The molecular and biochemical properties of the purified recombinant protein showed the characteristic features of a typical mono-functional plant catalase. These results attest to the usefulness of the present protocol for production of plant catalase using E. coli as heterologous expression system.
21847023	Molecular mechanism of crown root initiation and the different mechanisms between crown root and radicle in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Monocot plants produce numerous adventitious (crown) roots. The plant hormone auxin has positive effects on crown root formation, while cytokinin suppresses it. We have demonstrated that auxin-induced CROWN ROOTLESS5 (CRL5) regulates crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling. CRL5 overexpressing calli formed adventitious roots, although CRL5 overexpressing plants did not induce ectopic roots, suggesting that CRL5, which promotes de novo root initiation, might function only in de-differentiated cells. A radicle initiated normally in a crl5 mutant, in spite of the defect in crown root initiation, whereas crown roots, but not a radicle, were produced in a radicleless1 (ral1) mutant. A crl5 ral1 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, showing that the formation of each root is regulated by different genetic mechanisms in rice.
22021418	The Mediator complex in plants: structure, phylogeny, and expression profiling of representative genes in a dicot (Arabidopsis) and a monocot (rice) during reproduction and abiotic stress.	2011	Plant Physiol	The Mediator (Med) complex relays regulatory information from DNA-bound transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. This macromolecular unit is composed of three core subcomplexes in addition to a separable kinase module. In this study, conservation of Meds has been investigated in 16 plant species representing seven diverse groups across the plant kingdom. Using Hidden Markov Model-based conserved motif searches, we have identified all the known yeast/metazoan Med components in one or more plant groups, including the Med26 subunits, which have not been reported so far for any plant species. We also detected orthologs for the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Med32, -33, -34, -35, -36, and -37 in all the plant groups, and in silico analysis identified the Med32 and Med33 subunits as apparent orthologs of yeast/metazoan Med2/29 and Med5/24, respectively. Consequently, the plant Med complex appears to be composed of one or more members of 34 subunits, as opposed to 25 and 30 members in yeast and metazoans, respectively. Despite low similarity in primary Med sequences between the plants and their fungal/metazoan partners, secondary structure modeling of these proteins revealed a remarkable similarity between them, supporting the conservation of Med organization across kingdoms. Phylogenetic analysis between plant, human, and yeast revealed single clade relatedness for 29 Med genes families in plants, plant Meds being closer to human than to yeast counterparts. Expression profiling of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis Med genes reveals that Meds not only act as a basal regulator of gene expression but may also have specific roles in plant development and under abiotic stress conditions.
22078375	Induced over-expression of the transcription factor OsDREB2A improves drought tolerance in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	The DREB and CBF transcription factors play a critical role in plant development and abiotic stress responses and, therefore, represent attractive targets for a molecular plant breeding approach. In this study, the rice OsDREB2A gene was isolated and expressed under the control of a stress-inducible promoter (4ABRC) to improve the abiotic stress tolerance of japonica rice variety TNG67. T₂ and T₃ transgenic lines over-expressing OsDREB2A were found to have improved survival rates under severe drought and salt stress conditions relative to non-transgenic rice plants or rice plants transformed with the empty vector control. OsDREB2A expression was found to be markedly induced by drought and ABA treatment. The results indicate that the induced over-expression of OsDREB2A driven by the 4ABRC promoter in engineered rice plants may protect cells during stress.
21978282	Improved antioxidant activity of BKOS Thai jasmine rice.	2012	Nat Prod Res	Thai jasmine rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. KDML105) is highly valued due to its subtle aroma, robust seed characteristics and high nutritional quality. Low-energy ion-beam bombardment was chosen to improve the quality of jasmine rice by mutation induction. One mutated variety, named BKOS, was found to exhibit a deep purple colour due to an increased accumulation of anthocyanin. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of cooked and uncooked rice extracts were compared with KDML105, BKOS and other rice mutants created by a low-energy ion beam. The BKOS extracts showed the highest total phenol content (0.140 and 0.096 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g(-1) dry extract from uncooked and cooked rice, respectively). The BKOS extracts also had improved antioxidant activities, determined using three standard methods: 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhdrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, ABTS radical cation (ABTS•(+)) decolourisation and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. BKOS extracts showed 2-2.5-fold increased levels for each method. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between the antioxidant activities of the cooked and uncooked BKOS rice extracts. The increased quantity of antioxidants in this anthocyanin-based natural product could allow antioxidants to be consumed by a wider population than what is currently possible.
21996937	Native polyubiquitin promoter of rice provides increased constitutive expression in stable transgenic rice plants.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	The rice Ubiquitin1 (Ubi1) promoter was tested to evaluate its capacity to express the heterologous gusA gene encoding β-glucuronidase in transgenic rice tissue relative to the commonly used Ubi1 corn promoter and the rice gibberellic acid insensitive (GAI) gene promoter element. Experimental results showed increased expression of gusA gene in rice tissue when driven by the native Ubi1 promoter when compared to the use of corn Ubi1 promoter. Results further indicated that the cis-regulatory elements present in the native promoter element might have been responsible for high expression. However, the gusA gene expression level when driven by the rice GAI promoter was notably lower than both Ubi1 promoters. The present study, thus, for the first time helped to demonstrate that the native Ubi1 promoter is a promising genetic element in transgenic approaches for constitutive expression of any gene in rice tissue.
21984727	The chloroplast-localized phospholipases D α4 and α5 regulate herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	The oxylipin pathway is of central importance for plant defensive responses. Yet, the first step of the pathway, the liberation of linolenic acid following induction, is poorly understood. Phospholipases D (PLDs) have been hypothesized to mediate this process, but data from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) regarding the role of PLDs in plant resistance have remained controversial. Here, we cloned two chloroplast-localized PLD genes from rice (Oryza sativa), OsPLDα4 and OsPLDα5, both of which were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, mechanical wounding, and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA). Antisense expression of OsPLDα4 and -α5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2). The impaired oxylipin and ethylene signaling in as-pld plants decreased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin protease inhibitors and volatiles, improved the performance of SSB and the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, and reduced the attractiveness of plants to a larval parasitoid of SSB, Apanteles chilonis. The production of trypsin protease inhibitors in as-pld plants could be partially restored by JA, while the resistance to rice brown planthopper and SSB was restored by green leaf volatile application. Our results show that phospholipases function as important components of herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice.
22086537	Aluminum-induced oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant defenses in the roots of rice varieties differing in Al tolerance.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	The effects of aluminum (Al) on root elongation, lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation, antioxidant levels, antioxidant enzymatic activity, and lignin content in the roots of the Al-tolerant rice variety azucena and the Al-sensitive variety IR64 were investigated. Treatment with Al induced a greater decrease in root elongation and a greater increase in H(2)O(2) and lipid peroxidation as determined by the total thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) level in IR64 than in azucena. Azucena had significantly higher levels of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase GSH POD activity compared with IR64. The concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid, and the GSH/GSSG ratio (reduced vs. oxidized glutathione) were also higher in azucena than in IR64 in the presence of Al. The addition of 1 mg/L GSH improved root elongation in both varieties and decreased H(2)O(2) production under Al stress. By contrast, treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, decreased root elongation in azucena and stimulated H(2)O(2) production in both varieties. Moreover, Al treatment significantly increased the cytoplasmic activity of peroxidase (POD) as well as the levels of POD bound ionically and covalently to cell walls in the Al-sensitive variety. The lignin content was also increased. Treatment with exogenous H(2)O(2) also increased the lignin content and decreased root elongation in IR64. These results suggest that Al induces lignification in the roots of Al-sensitive rice varieties, probably through an increase in H(2)O(2) accumulation.
22092531	CDKB2 is involved in mitosis and DNA damage response in rice.	2012	Plant J	DNA damage checkpoints delay mitotic cell-cycle progression in response to DNA stress, stalling the cell cycle to allow time for repair. CDKB is a plant-specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) that is required for the G₂/M transition of the cell cycle. In Arabidopsis, DNA damage leads the degradation of CDKB2, and the subsequent G₂ arrest gives cells time to repair damaged DNA. G₂ arrest also triggers transition from the mitotic cycle to endoreduplication, leading to the presence of polyploid cells in many tissues. In contrast, in rice (Oryza sativa), polyploid cells are found only in the endosperm. It was unclear whether endoreduplication contributes to alleviating DNA damage in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we show that DNA damage neither down-regulates Orysa;CDKB2;1 nor induces endoreduplication in rice. Furthermore, we found increased levels of Orysa;CDKB2;1 protein upon DNA damage. These results suggest that CDKB2 functions differently in Arabidopsis and rice in response to DNA damage. Arabidopsis may adopt endoreduplication as a survival strategy under genotoxic stress conditions, but rice may enhance DNA repair capacity upon genotoxic stress. In addition, polyploid cells due to endomitosis were present in CDKB2;1 knockdown rice, suggesting an important role for Orysa;CDKB2;1 during mitosis.
22065257	Identification of transcriptome profiles and signaling pathways for the allelochemical juglone in rice roots.	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) is known allelochemical, but its molecular mode of action is not well understood. We found that juglone induced reactive oxygen species production and calcium accumulation. To gain more insight into these cellular responses, we performed large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during juglone stress. Exposure to juglone triggered changes in transcript levels of genes related to cell growth, cell wall formation, chemical detoxification, abiotic stress response and epigenesis. The most predominant transcription-factor families were AP2/ERF, HSF, NAC, C2H2, WRKY, MYB and GRAS. Gene expression profiling of juglone-treated rice roots revealed upregulated signaling and biosynthesis of abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and inactivation of gibberellic acid. In addition, juglone upregulated the expression of two calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), 6 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes and 1 MAPK gene and markedly increased the activities of a CDPK-like kinase and MAPKs. Further characterization of these juglone-responsive genes may be helpful for better understanding the mechanisms of allelochemical tolerance in plants.
22113591	Delimitation of a QTL region controlling cold tolerance at booting stage of a cultivar, 'Lijiangxintuanheigu', in rice, Oryza sativa L.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Low temperature at the booting stage of rice causes male sterility resulting in severe yield loss. Cold tolerance has long been an important objective in rice breeding. We identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cold tolerance on the long arm of chromosome 3 from the cold-tolerant breeding line 'Ukei 840' by using F(2) and BC(1)F(2) populations from crosses between 'Ukei 840' and 'Hitomebore'. The cold tolerance of 'Ukei 840' is derived from the Chinese cultivar 'Lijiangxintuanheigu'. The effect of this QTL on cold tolerance was confirmed by developing 'Hitomebore' chromosome segment substitution lines having 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' alleles on chromosome 3. By producing recombinants in chromosome 3, the QTL region for cold tolerance was delimited to the region of about 1.2-Mb region between RM3719 and RM7000. All lines heterozygous for the QTL showed seed fertilities as low as that of 'Hitomebore', suggesting that the 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' allele for cold tolerance in the QTL region is recessive. Determination of a 1.2-Mb nucleotide sequence of 'Ukei 840' and comparison with the published genomic sequence of 'Nipponbare' showed 254 SNPs, of which 11 were in coding regions of genes, seven in five genes being non-synonymous. SNPs were detected in the 5-kb upstream regions of 89 genes, but no differences of gene expression levels were detected between alleles of these genes. Although further delimitation is required to identify the gene responsible for cold tolerance of 'Lijiangxintuanheigu', SNP markers developed here will be useful for marker-assisted selection in a breeding program using 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' as a donor of cold tolerance.
21737747	An ATP-binding cassette subfamily G full transporter is essential for the retention of leaf water in both wild barley and rice.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Land plants have developed a cuticle preventing uncontrolled water loss. Here we report that an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G (ABCG) full transporter is required for leaf water conservation in both wild barley and rice. A spontaneous mutation, eibi1.b, in wild barley has a low capacity to retain leaf water, a phenotype associated with reduced cutin deposition and a thin cuticle. Map-based cloning revealed that Eibi1 encodes an HvABCG31 full transporter. The gene was highly expressed in the elongation zone of a growing leaf (the site of cutin synthesis), and its gene product also was localized in developing, but not in mature tissue. A de novo wild barley mutant named "eibi1.c," along with two transposon insertion lines of rice mutated in the ortholog of HvABCG31 also were unable to restrict water loss from detached leaves. HvABCG31 is hypothesized to function as a transporter involved in cutin formation. Homologs of HvABCG31 were found in green algae, moss, and lycopods, indicating that this full transporter is highly conserved in the evolution of land plants.
21593600	Induction of systemic resistance in rice by leaf extracts of Zizyphus jujuba and Ipomoea carnea against Rhizoctonia solani.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Plants accumulate a great diversity of natural products, many of which confer protective effects against phytopathogenic attack. Earlier we had demonstrated that the leaf extracts of Zizyphus jujuba and Ipomoea carnea inhibit the in vitro mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani, and effectively reduce the incidence of sheath blight disease in rice. Here we demonstrate that foliar application of the aqueous leaf extracts of Z. jujuba and I. carnea followed by challenge inoculation with R. solani induces systemic resistance in rice as evident from significantly increased accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins such as chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase and peroxidase, as well as defense-related compounds such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and phenolic substances. Thin layer chromatographic separation of secondary metabolites revealed presence of alkaloid and terpenoid compounds in the leaf extracts of Z. jujuba that exhibited toxicity against R. solani under in vitro condition. Thus, the enhanced sheath blight resistance in rice seedlings treated with leaf extracts of Z. jujuba or I. carnea can be attributed to the direct inhibitory effects of these leaf extracts as well as their ability to elicit systemic resistance against R. solani.
21792744	Heat shock factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.): genome-wide expression analysis during reproductive development and abiotic stress.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Plants respond to heat stress by enhancing the expression of genes encoding heat shock protein (HSPs) genes through activation of heat shock factors (HSFs) which interact with heat shock elements present in the promoter of HSP genes. Plant HSFs have been divided into three conserved classes viz A, B and C. In the present study, a detailed analysis has been done of all rice HSFs, along with their spliced variants. Their chromosomal localization reveals that six HSFs are segmentally duplicated and four pairs of these segmentally duplicated HSF encoding genes show pseudo-functionalization. Expression profiling through microarray and quantitative real-time PCR showed that eight OsHsfs express at a higher level during seed development, while six HSFs are up-regulated in all the abiotic stresses studied. The expression of OsHsfA2a gene in particular was greatly stimulated by heat stress in both root and shoot tissues and also during panicle and seed development. OsHsfA3 was found more responsive to cold and drought stress, while OsHsfA7 and OsHsfA9 showed developing seed-specific expression. This study also revealed that spliced variants generally accumulated at a higher level in all the tissues examined. Different hormones/elicitors like ABA, brassinosteroids and salicylic acid also alter OsHsf gene expression. Calcium in combination with heat stress elevated further the level of HSF transcripts. Expression analysis by both microarray and real-time RT-PCR revealed a unique stable constitutive expression of OsHsfA1 across all the tissues and stresses. A detailed in silico analysis involving identification of unidentified domains has been done by MEME-motif tool in their full-length proteins as well as in DNA-binding domains. Analysis of 1 kb putative promoter region revealed presence of tissue-specific, abiotic stress and hormone-related cis-acting elements, correlating with expression under stress conditions.
21726237	A paralog of the MtN3/saliva family recessively confers race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae in rice.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Approximately one third of the identified 34 rice major disease resistance (R) genes conferring race-specific resistance to different strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes rice bacterial blight disease, are recessive genes. However, only two of the recessive resistance genes have been characterized thus far. Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance. The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth. It encodes a protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes, including mammals. Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339. The encoding proteins of recessive xa25 and its dominant allele Xa25 have eight amino acid differences. The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections. The nature of xa25-encoding protein and its expression pattern in comparison with its susceptible allele in rice-Xoo interaction indicate that the mechanism of xa25-mediated resistance appears to be different from that conferred by most of the characterized R proteins.
21300551	Expression of defense genes and activities of antioxidant enzymes in rice resistance to rice stripe virus and small brown planthopper.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	The rice variety Tai06-1 is resistant to rice stripe disease and Xiushui63 is a highly susceptible rice variety to this disease. These two varieties were used to analyze the expression patterns of defense genes and antioxidant defense responses at the seedling stage, upon feeding with viruliferous small brown planthopper (SBPH) and nonviruliferous SBPH, respectively. The expression levels of CP (coat protein) gene of rice stripe virus (RSV) were higher upon feeding with viruliferous SBPH in Xiushui63 than in Tai06-1 throughout most of the experimental period, suggesting that RSV replicaiton is disturbed in Tai06-1 but not in Xiushui63, therefore, the resistance to RSV is higher in Tai06-1 than in Xiuhsui63. We found that defense genes PR1a (pathogenesis-related class 1a), PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), and CHS (chalcone synthase) may play roles in the defense responses to both RSV and SBPH in Tai06-1, and PR4 and PR10a may only participate in defending against SBPH attack but not against RSV infection in Tai06-1. Our data reveal that Gns1 (1,3; 1,4-β-glucanase) may participate in the defense responses to both RSV and SBPH in Xiushui63 but not in Tai06-1, and LOX (lipoxygenase) may only participate in defending against to SBPH in both Tai06-1 and Xiushui63. The antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde coordinately participate in the resistance to RSV in Tai06-1, and that oxidative damage is less in Tai06-1 than in Xiushui63.
21352959	An efficient and reproducible method for regeneration of whole plants from mature seeds of a high yielding Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) variety PAU 201.	2011	N Biotechnol	Tissue culture is one of the tools necessary for genetic engineering and many other breeding programs. Moreover, selection of high regenerating rice varieties is a pre-requisite for success in rice biotechnology. In this report we established a reproducible plant regeneration system through somatic embryogenesis. The explants used for regeneration were embryogenic calli derived from mature seeds cultured on callus induction media. For callus induction mature seeds were cultured on MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose combined with 560 mg/l proline and 1.5-3.5 mg/l 2,4-D and 0.5-1.5 mg/l Kin. For plant regeneration, embryogenic calli were transferred to MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose, supplemented with 1.0-3.0 mg/l BAP, 0.5-1.5 mg/l Kin and 0.5-1.5 mg/l NAA. The highest frequency of callus induction (44.4%) was observed on the MS medium supplemented with 2.5 mg/l 2,4-D, 0.5 mg/l Kin, 560 mg/l proline and 30 g/l sucrose. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration (42.5%) was observed on the MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/l BAP, 0.5 mg/l NAA and 0.5 mg/l Kin. The plantlets were hardened and transferred to soil in earthen pots. The developed method was highly reproducible. The in vitro developed plants showed normal growth and flowering under glasshouse conditions.
21805338	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far. However, the relationship among these four genes is still unclear, which will impede the process of gene pyramiding breeding program to some extent. To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level. The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3. Meanwhile, qSW5 can be down-regulated by repression of GW2 transcription. Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3. Moreover, the allelic effects of qSW5 and GS3 were detailedly characterized based on a natural population consisting of 180 rice cultivars. It was indicated that mutual interactions exist between the two genes, in which, qSW5 affecting seed length is masked by GS3 alleles, and GS3 affecting seed width is masked by qSW5 alleles. These findings provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed size development in rice and are likely to be useful for improving rice grain yield.
21800099	Isolation of rice dwarf mutants with ectopic deposition of phenolic components including lignin in parenchyma cell walls of internodes.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Rice internodes must have the proper shape to support high-yielding panicles. The shape of internodes is controlled by various factors involved in their formation, such as developmental patterns, cell division, cell elongation, and cell wall biosynthesis. To understand the regulation of internode development, we screened dwarf mutants to identify those with a phenotype of ectopic deposits of phenolic components in parenchyma cell walls of internodes. We named these mutants ectopic deposition of phenolic components1 (edp1). Two alleles were identified, edp1-1 and edp1-2. Furthermore, these mutants showed disordered cell files in internode parenchyma. These abnormal phenotypes were very similar to that of a previously reported dwarf50 (d50) mutant. Genetic analyses of edp1 mutants revealed that the edp1 loci are distinct from d50. Our results indicate that analyses of edp1 mutants as well as the d50 mutant will be useful for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind ectopic deposition of cell wall phenolic components in internode parenchyma cells and the regulation of internode development.
21806801	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: In rice, the major part of the post-embryonic root system is made of stem-derived roots named crown roots (CR). Among the few characterized rice mutants affected in root development, crown rootless1 mutant is unable to initiate crown root primordia. CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) is induced by auxin and encodes an AS2/LOB-domain transcription factor that acts upstream of the gene regulatory network controlling CR development.

RESULTS: To identify genes involved in CR development, we compared global gene expression profile in stem bases of crl1 mutant and wild-type (WT) plants. Our analysis revealed that 250 and 236 genes are down- and up-regulated respectively in the crl1 mutant. Auxin induces CRL1 expression and consequently it is expected that auxin also alters the expression of genes that are early regulated by CRL1. To identify genes under the early control of CRL1, we monitored the expression kinetics of a selected subset of genes, mainly chosen among those exhibiting differential expression, in crl1 and WT following exogenous auxin treatment. This analysis revealed that most of these genes, mainly related to hormone, water and nutrient, development and homeostasis, were likely not regulated directly by CRL1. We hypothesized that the differential expression for these genes observed in the crl1 mutant is likely a consequence of the absence of CR formation. Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified. FSM/FAS1 and GTE4 are known in rice and Arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively.

CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the differential regulation of most genes in crl1 versus WT may be an indirect consequence of CRL1 inactivation resulting from the absence of CR in the crl1 mutant. Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1. These genes have a function related to polarized cell growth, cell cycle regulation or chromatin remodelling. This suggests that these genes are controlled by CRL1 and involved in CR initiation in rice.
21777252	Enhanced zinc uptake by rice through phytosiderophore secretion: a modelling study.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) secretes far smaller amounts of metal-complexing phytosiderophores (PS) than other grasses. But there is increasing evidence that it relies on PS secretion for its zinc (Zn) uptake. After nitrogen, Zn deficiency is the most common nutrient disorder in rice, affecting up to 50% of lowland rice soils globally. We developed a mathematical model of PS secretion from roots and resulting solubilization and uptake of Zn, allowing for root growth, diurnal variation in secretion, decomposition of the PS in the soil, and the transport and interaction of the PS and Zn in the soil. A sensitivity analysis showed that with realistic parameter values for rice in submerged soil, the typically observed rates of PS secretion from rice are sufficient and necessary to explain observed rates of Zn uptake. There is little effect of diurnal variation in secretion on cumulative Zn uptake, irrespective of other model parameter values, indicating that the observed diurnal variation is not causally related to Zn uptake efficiency. Rooting density has a large effect on uptake per unit PS secretion as a result of overlap of the zones of influence of neighbouring roots. The effects of other complications in the rice rhizosphere are discussed.
21788375	Cell division and cell elongation in the coleoptile of rice alcohol dehydrogenase 1-deficient mutant are reduced under complete submergence.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When rice seeds germinate under complete submergence, only the coleoptile elongates efficiently. It has been reported previously that coleoptile elongation is reduced in the rice alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)-deficient mutant, reduced adh activity (rad). The aim of this study was to elucidate how expressions of genes responsible for coleoptile elongation are affected by the ADH1 deficiency in the rad mutant under submergence.

METHODS: To identify genes whose expressions are changed in the rad coleoptile at an early stage in germination (i.e. 1 d after imbibition), coleoptiles of the rad mutant and its wild type (WT) were isolated by laser microdissection, and their mRNA levels were examined with a microarray.

KEY RESULTS: The microarray analysis identified 431 genes whose transcript levels were different between rad and WT. Interestingly, among the down-regulated genes in the rad coleoptile, 17·5 % were cell division-related genes and 5·1 % were cell elongation-related genes. It was found that cell division started at 1 d after imbibition and then gradually ceased, whereas in the WT coleoptile cell elongation started between 1 d and 2 d after imbibition and then continued. However, neither cell division nor cell elongation actively occurred in the rad coleoptile, in which the amounts of ATP were reduced.

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cell division, as well as cell elongation, occur during coleoptile elongation in rice under complete submergence, and that the reduced ATP levels caused by the ADH1 deficiency repress both of them, thereby impairing coleoptile elongation in the rad mutant under submerged conditions.
21844309	The rice miniature inverted repeat transposable element mPing is an effective insertional mutagen in soybean.	2011	Plant Physiol	Insertional mutagenesis of legume genomes such as soybean (Glycine max) should aid in identifying genes responsible for key traits such as nitrogen fixation and seed quality. The relatively low throughput of soybean transformation necessitates the use of a transposon-tagging strategy where a single transformation event will produce many mutations over a number of generations. However, existing transposon-tagging tools being used in legumes are of limited utility because of restricted transposition (Ac/Ds: soybean) or the requirement for tissue culture activation (Tnt1: Medicago truncatula). A recently discovered transposable element from rice (Oryza sativa), mPing, and the genes required for its mobilization, were transferred to soybean to determine if it will be an improvement over the other available transposon-tagging tools. Stable transformation events in soybean were tested for mPing transposition. Analysis of mPing excision at early and late embryo developmental stages revealed increased excision during late development in most transgenic lines, suggesting that transposition is developmentally regulated. Transgenic lines that produced heritable mPing insertions were identified, with the plants from the highest activity line producing at least one new insertion per generation. Analysis of the mPing insertion sites in the soybean genome revealed that features displayed in rice were retained including transposition to unlinked sites and a preference for insertion within 2.5 kb of a gene. Taken together these findings indicate that mPing has the characteristics necessary for an effective transposon-tagging resource.
21778827	Rice G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR): in silico analysis and transcription regulation under abiotic stress.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Majority of transmembrane signal transduction in response to diverse external stimuli is mediated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are the principal signal transducers. GPCRs are characterized by seven membrane-spanning domains with an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus which functions along with GTP-binding protein in a highly coordinated fashion. Role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in abiotic stresses has been reported, but the response of GPCR is not yet well characterized. In the present study we report the isolation of one putative GPCR (966 bp) from Indica rice (Oryza sativa cv. Indica group Swarna) and described its transcriptional regulation under abiotic stresses. Amino acid sequence analyses shows the presence of typical heptahelical transmembrane spanning domains with extracellular N-terminus involved in ligand binding and cytoplasm facing C-terminus that binds with heterotrimeric G-protein. Sequence analysis also confirmed the presence of all signature motifs required for functional GPCR. Domain and site prediction shows the presence of myristoylation sites for membrane association, and protein kinase C sites for its desensitization. The transcript levels of rice GPCR was induced following NaCl and ABA treatments. However, in drought condition the expression profile of GPCR up regulated during early exposure which subsequently decreased. On the other hand it seems no significant effect due to cold and heat stress. These findings provide a direct evidence for transcriptional regulation of rice GPCR under abiotic stress conditions. These findings also suggest that GPCR can be exploited for promoting stress tolerance in plants.
21832284	Comprehensive sequence and whole-life-cycle expression profile analysis of the phosphate transporter gene family in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	Plant phosphate transporter (PT) genes comprise a large family with important roles in various physiological and biochemical processes. In this study, a database search yielded 26 potential PT family genes in rice (Oryza sativa). Analysis of these genes led to identification of eight conserved motifs and 5-12 trans-membrane segments, most of them conserved. A total of 237 putative cis elements were found in the 2-kb upstream region of these genes. Of these, a majority were Pi-response and other stress-related cis regulatory elements, such as PHO-like, TATA-box-like, PHR1, or Helix-loop-helix elements, and WRKY1 and ABRE elements, suggesting gene regulation by these signals. Comprehensive expression analysis of these genes was performed using data from microarrays hybridized with RNA from 27 tissues covering the entire lifecycle from three rice genotypes: Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and Shanyou 63. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that three rice PT genes are preferentially expressed in stamen at 1 d before flowering, two in panicle at the heading stage, and two in flag leaf at 14 d after the heading stage. Hormone-treatment experiments revealed differential up-regulation or down-regulation of 11 rice PT genes in seedlings exposed to five hormones, respectively. These results will be useful for elucidating the roles of these genes in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice plant.
21856794	Conservation and purifying selection of transcribed genes located in a rice centromere.	2011	Plant Cell	Recombination is strongly suppressed in centromeric regions. In chromosomal regions with suppressed recombination, deleterious mutations can easily accumulate and cause degeneration of genes and genomes. Surprisingly, the centromere of chromosome8 (Cen8) of rice (Oryza sativa) contains several transcribed genes. However, it remains unclear as to what selective forces drive the evolution and existence of transcribed genes in Cen8. Sequencing of orthologous Cen8 regions from two additional Oryza species, Oryza glaberrima and Oryza brachyantha, which diverged from O. sativa 1 and 10 million years ago, respectively, revealed a set of seven transcribed Cen8 genes conserved across all three species. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with the centromere-specific histone CENH3 confirmed that the sequenced orthologous regions are part of the functional centromere. All seven Cen8 genes have undergone purifying selection, representing a striking phenomenon of active gene survival within a recombination-free zone over a long evolutionary time. The coding sequences of the Cen8 genes showed sequence divergence and mutation rates that were significantly reduced from those of genes located on the chromosome arms. This suggests that Oryza has a mechanism to maintain the fidelity and functionality of Cen8 genes, even when embedded in a sea of repetitive sequences and transposable elements.
21810995	Functional analysis of all AGAMOUS subfamily members in rice reveals their roles in reproductive organ identity determination and meristem determinacy.	2011	Plant Cell	Reproductive organ development is one of the most important steps in the life cycle of plants. Studies using core eudicot species like thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) have shown that MADS domain transcription factors belonging to the AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily regulate the identity of stamens, carpels, and ovules and that they are important for floral meristem determinacy. Here, we investigate the genetic interactions between the four rice (Oryza sativa) AG subfamily members, MADS3, MADS13, MADS21, and MADS58. Our data show that, in contrast with previous reports, MADS3 and MADS58 determine stamen and carpel identity and, together with MADS13, are important for floral meristem determinacy. In the mads3 mads58 double mutant, we observed a complete loss of reproductive organ identity and massive accumulation of lodicules in the third and fourth floral whorls. MADS21 is an AGL11 lineage gene whose expression is not restricted to ovules. Instead, its expression profile is similar to those of class C genes. However, our genetic analysis shows that MADS21 has no function in stamen, carpel, or ovule identity determination.
21880076	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 directly binds to iron and other divalent metals for sensing cellular iron status.	2012	Plant J	Iron is essential for most living organisms and its availability often determines survival and proliferation. The Oryza sativa (rice) transcription factor IDEF1 plays a crucial role in regulating iron deficiency-induced genes involved in iron homeostasis. In the present report, we found characteristic histidine-asparagine repeat and proline-rich regions in IDEF1 and its homolog in Hordeum vulgare (barley), HvIDEF1. An immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography assay revealed that IDEF1 and HvIDEF1 bind to various divalent metals, including Fe(2+) and Ni(2+) . Recombinant IDEF1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli contained mainly Fe and Zn. This metal-binding activity of IDEF1 was almost abolished by deletion of the histidine-asparagine and proline-rich regions, but DNA-binding and trans-activation functions were not impaired by the deletion. Transgenic rice plants constitutively overexpressing IDEF1 without these metal-binding domains failed to cause pleiotropic effects conferred by overexpression of full-length IDEF1, including a low germination rate, impaired seedling growth, tolerance to iron deficiency in hydroponic culture, and enhanced expression of various iron deficiency-inducible genes. Impairment of the transcriptional regulation of IDEF1 by deletion of the metal-binding domains occurred primarily at an early stage of iron deficiency. These results suggest that the histidine-asparagine and proline-rich regions in rice IDEF1 directly bind to divalent metals and sense the cellular metal ion balance caused by changes in iron availability.
21880933	Molecular dissection of the roles of phytochrome in photoperiodic flowering in rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Phytochromes mediate the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network that enables the critical daylength response of florigen gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of florigen expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, and all of the phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of florigen expression in rice.
21914668	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3.	None	J Hered	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening. Because the genetic diversity of this locus is not known yet, the full sequence of RSUS3 from 43 rice varieties was amplified to examine the distribution of DNA polymorphisms. A total of 254 sequence variants, including SNPs and insertion/deletions, were successfully identified in the 7733 bp sequence that comprises the promoter, exons and introns, and 3' downstream nontranscribed region (NTR). Eleven haplotypes were distinguished among the 43 rice varieties based on nucleotide variation in the 3 defined regions (5' NTR, transcript, and 3' NTR). The promoter region showed evidence of a base change on a cis-element that might influence the functional role of the motif in seed-specific expression. The genetic diversity of the RSUS3 gene sequences in the rice germplasm used in this study appears to be the result of nonrandom processes. Analysis of polymorphism sites indicated that at least 11 recombinations have occurred, primarily in the transcribed region. This finding provides insight into the development of a cladistic approach for establishing future genetic association studies of the RSUS3 locus.
21924254	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice.	2011	Dev Biol	Grasses have highly specialized flowers and their outer floral organ identity remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized rice mutants that specifically disrupted the development of palea, one of the outer whorl floral organs. The depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides. The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants. In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration. Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size. E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp1-2 mutant. We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development. The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor. We further found that SDP1/REP1 is downstreamly regulated by DP1.
21298364	Fine mapping QTL for drought resistance traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.) using bulk segregant analysis.	2011	Mol Biotechnol	Drought stress is a major limitation to rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields and its stability, especially in rainfed conditions. Developing rice cultivars with inherent capacity to withstand drought stress would improve rainfed rice production. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to drought resistance traits will help to develop rice cultivars suitable for water-limited environments through molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategy. However, QTL mapping is usually carried out by genotyping large number of progenies, which is labour-intensive, time-consuming and cost-ineffective. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) serves as an affordable strategy for mapping large effect QTLs by genotyping only the extreme phenotypes instead of the entire mapping population. We have previously mapped a QTL linked to leaf rolling and leaf drying in recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived from two locally adapted indica rice ecotypes viz., IR20/Nootripathu using BSA. Fine mapping the QTL will facilitate its application in MAS. BSA was done by bulking DNA of 10 drought-resistant and 12 drought-sensitive RI lines. Out of 343 rice microsatellites markers genotyped, RM8085 co-segregated among the RI lines constituting the respective bulks. RM8085 was mapped in the middle of the QTL region on chromosome 1 previously identified in these RI lines thus reducing the QTL interval from 7.9 to 3.8 cM. Further, the study showed that the region, RM212-RM302-RM8085-RM3825 on chromosome 1, harbours large effect QTLs for drought-resistance traits across several genetic backgrounds in rice. Thus, the QTL may be useful for drought resistance improvement in rice through MAS and map-based cloning.
21951138	Effect of individual suppression of RBCS multigene family on Rubisco contents in rice leaves.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	In higher plants, a small subunit of Rubisco is encoded for by an RBCS multigene family in the nuclear genome. However, it is unknown how each multigene member contributes to the accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme. Here, four RBCS genes that are highly expressed in leaf blaedes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) were individually suppressed by RNAi, and the effects on leaf Rubisco content were examined at seedling, vegetative and reproductive stages. Rubisco contents in each transgenic line declined irrespective of growth stage, and the ratios of Rubisco-N to total N were 66-96% of wild-type levels. The mRNA levels of the suppressed RBCS genes declined significantly, whereas those of the unsuppressed ones did not change drastically. These results indicate that four RBCS genes all contribute to accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme irrespective of growth stage and that suppression of one RBCS gene is not fully compensated by other RBCS genes. Additionally, the mRNA levels of the large subunit of Rubisco showed a change similar to that of total RBCS mRNA level irrespective of genotype and growth stage. These results suggest that gene expression of RBCS and RBCL is regulated in a coordinated manner at the transcript level in rice.
22057998	Identification of neutral genes at pollen sterility loci Sd and Se of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) with wild rice (O. rufipogon) origin.	2011	Genet Mol Res	Pollen sterility is one of the main hindrances against the utilization of strong intersubspecific (indica-japonica) heterosis in rice. We looked for neutral alleles at known pollen sterility loci Sd and Se that could overcome this pollen sterility characteristic. Taichung 65, a typical japonica cultivar, and its near isogenic lines E7 and E8 for pollen sterility loci Sd and Se were employed as tester lines for crossing with 13 accessions of wild rice (O. rufipogon). Pollen fertility and genotypic segregations of the molecular markers tightly linked with Sd and Se loci were analyzed in the paired F(1)s and F(2) populations. One accession of wild rice (GZW054) had high pollen fertility in the paired F(1)s between Taichung 65 and E7 or E8. Genotypic segregations of the molecular markers tightly linked with Sd and Se loci fit the expected Mendelian ratio (1:2:1), and non-significances were shown among the mean pollen fertilities with the maternal, parental, and heterozygous genotypes of each molecular markers tightly linked with Sd and Se loci. Evidentially, it indicated that the alleles of Sd and Se loci for GZW054 did not interact with those of Taichung 65 and its near isogenic lines, and, thus were identified as neutral alleles Sd(n) and Se(n). These neutral genes could become important germplasm resources for overcoming pollen sterility in indica-japonica hybrids, making utilization of strong heterosis in such hybrids viable.
21973320	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis.	2012	Plant J	Higher plants have evolved multiple proteins in the RNase III family to produce and regulate different classes of small RNAs with specialized molecular functions. In rice (Oryza sativa), numerous genomic clusters are targeted by one of two microRNAs (miRNAs), miR2118 and miR2275, to produce secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of either 21 or 24 nucleotides in a phased manner. The biogenesis requirements or the functions of the phased small RNAs are completely unknown. Here we examine the rice Dicer-Like (DCL) family, including OsDCL1, -3a, -3b and -4. By deep sequencing of small RNAs from different tissues of the wild type and osdcl4-1, we revealed that the processing of 21-nucleotide siRNAs, including trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNA) and over 1000 phased small RNA loci, was largely dependent on OsDCL4. Surprisingly, the processing of 24-nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family. RNA ligase-mediated 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE)/degradome analysis confirmed that most of the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA clusters were initiated from the target sites of miR2118 and miR2275, respectively. Furthermore, the accumulation of the two triggering miRNAs requires OsDCL1 activity. Finally, we show that phased small RNAs are preferentially produced in the male reproductive organs and are likely to be conserved in monocots. Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice.
22038450	Over-expression of OSRIP18 increases drought and salt tolerance in transgenic rice plants.	2012	Transgenic Res	Both drought and high salinity stresses are major abiotic factors that limit the yield of agricultural crops. Transgenic techniques have been regarded as effective ways to improve crops in their tolerance to these abiotic stresses. Functional characterization of genes is the prerequisite to identify candidates for such improvement. Here, we have investigated the biological functions of an Oryza sativa Ribosome-inactivating protein gene 18 (OSRIP18) by ectopically expressing this gene under the control of CaMV 35S promoter in the rice genome. We have generated 11 independent transgenic rice plants and all of them showed significantly increased tolerance to drought and high salinity stresses. Global gene expression changes by Microarray analysis showed that more than 100 probe sets were detected with up-regulated expression abundance while signals from only three probe sets were down-regulated after over-expression of OSRIP18. Most of them were not regulated by drought or high salinity stresses. Our data suggested that the increased tolerance to these abiotic stresses in transgenic plants might be due to up-regulation of some stress-dependent/independent genes and OSRIP18 may be potentially useful in further improving plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses by over-expression.
21984008	Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue.	2012	Biotechnol Lett	Small heat shock proteins are involved in stress tolerance. We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress. In this study, we transferred this gene to tall fescue plants by an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. The integration and expression of the transgene was confirmed by PCR, Southern, northern, and immunoblot analyzes. Compared to the control plants, the transgenic plants had significantly lower electrolyte leakage and accumulation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances when exposed to heat or methyl viologen. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) in the transgenic tall fescue plants was higher than that in the control plants during heat stress (42°C). These results suggest that the OsHSP26 protein plays an important role in the protection of PSII during heat and oxidative stress in vivo.
21988523	Expression of the Aeluropus littoralis AlSAP gene in rice confers broad tolerance to abiotic stresses through maintenance of photosynthesis.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	The expression of AlSAP, in rice cv. Nipponbare, enhances plant tolerance to cold, drought and salt stresses. AlSAP lines showed 100% survival rate and set seeds while control plants did not recover from the cold treatment. Under a severe drought stress treatment (fraction of transpirable soil water down to 0.1), AlSAP lines exhibited enhanced Transpiration Efficiency (TE) and maintained a high A (Assimilation rate) value (22 µmol·m(-2)  s(-1) ) while these values dramatically decreased (A = 4 µmol·m(-2)  s(-1) ) in control plants which were subsequently unable to recover from the stress. Of noteworthy is that AlSAP rice plants yielded a similar and a 60% seed set under control and stress conditions respectively, with regard to wild-type (WT) plants grown under control conditions. This indicates that AlSAP expression imposes no yield penalty and allows seed production even following a severe drought stress at the vegetative stage. Furthermore, AlSAP rice was shown to accumulate transcripts of a pilot set of eight stress-related genes at a significantly higher level than WT plants, both under control and stressed conditions. The results suggest that AlSAP expression generates stress tolerance in plants through maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus integrity and by stimulating an endogenous adaptive potential which is not effectively accomplished in WT plants.
21921696	Identification and characterization of the major mitochondrial Fe transporter in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	The uptake, translocation, and compartmentalization of Fe are essential for plant cell function and life cycle. Despite rapid progress in our understanding of Fe homeostasis in plants, Fe transport from the cytoplasm to mitochondria was, until recently, poorly understood. The screening of 3,993 mutant lines for symptoms of Fe deficiency resulted in the identification and characterization of a major mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) in rice. MIT was found to localize to mitochondria and to complement the growth of a yeast strain defective in mitochondrial Fe transport. The knock-out of MIT resulted in a lethal phenotype, and in knock-down plants, several agronomic characteristics were compromised, such as plant height, average number of tillers, days to flower, fertility, and yield. Changes in the expression of genes involved in Fe transport suggested a disturbance of cellular Fe transport. Furthermore, the mitochondrial Fe concentration and the activity of the mitochondrial Fe-S enzyme aconitase were significantly reduced compared with wild-type plants. The identification of MIT is a significant advance in the field of plant Fe nutrition and should facilitate the cloning of paralogs from other plant species.
22099517	Generation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate from externally provided acetate in rice root.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	During the investigation of the metabolism of ¹⁴C-acetate or ¹⁴C-succinate in rice seedlings, an unknown organic acid (X) with a high specific radioactivity was detected in 10,000 × g 30 min precipitate-fraction of rice roots. The X was hardly extracted by 0.1 N-H₂SO₄ boiling, but was extracted by 0.5 N-KOH boiling. The X was co-chromatographed with several known organic acids, and the radioactive peak of the X matched β-hydroxybutyric acid (β-hydroxybutyrate). The radioactive X and β-hydroxybutyrate were then heated with concentrated H₂SO₄. The radioactivity and the titration value were completely converted to crotonic acid. Thus, it was concluded that the X was β-hydroxybutyrate, and the original form of this acid was presumed to be poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Then rice root incubated with 2-¹⁴C-acetate was extracted with hot-ethanol, ethanol/ether, and hot-chloroform. Approximately 10% of the radioactivity absorbed was detected in the chloroform fraction. The chloroform fraction was co-precipitated with authentic PHB by the addition of acetone/ether, and almost all the radioactivity was co-precipitated with the PHB. The radioactive co-precipitate was then heated with 0.5 N-NaOH, and chromatographed. The radioactivity of β-hydroxybutyrate plus crotonic acid almost matched that of the co-precipitate before alkaline-hydrolysis. Hence the radioactive co-precipitate was confirmed to be PHB. In wheat and radish seedlings, 2-¹⁴C-acetate was also assimilated into PHB. It is concluded that externally provided acetate was rapidly converted to PHB in higher plants.
21232645	Cellulase production in a new mutant strain of Penicillium decumbens ML-017 by solid state fermentation with rice bran.	2011	N Biotechnol	To produce cellulolytic enzyme efficiently, Penicillium decumbens strain L-06 was used to prepare mutants with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and UV-irradiation. A mutant strain ML-017 is shown to have a higher cellulase activity than others. Box-Behnken's design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were adopted to optimize the conditions of cellulase (filter paper activity, FPA) production in strain ML-017 by solid-state fermentation (SSF) with rice bran as the substrate. And the result shows that the initial pH, moisture content and culture temperature all have significant effect on the production of cellulase. The optimized condition shall be initial pH 5.7, moisture content 72% and culture temperature 30°C. The maximum cellulase (FPA) production was obtained under the optimized condition, which is 5.76 IU g(-1), increased by 44.12% to its original strain. It corresponded well with the calculated results (5.15 IU g(-1)) by model prediction. The result shows that both BBD and RSM are the cellulase optimization methods with good prospects.
22024734	Overexpression of monodehydroascorbate reductase from a mangrove plant (AeMDHAR) confers salt tolerance on rice.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), an important enzyme of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, is involved in salt tolerance of plants through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, a cDNA encoding MDHAR from the mangrove plant Acanthus ebracteatus was introduced into rice to examine its role in salt tolerance. Three stable transgenic lines (MT22, MT24 and MT25) overexpressing AeMDHAR were selected in vitro using hygromycin and confirmed by PCR, quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT) PCR and enzyme assay. The transgenic line MT24 was predicted to possess a single copy of the transgene while the other two transgenic lines were predicted to have multiple transgene integrations. The AeMDHAR transcripts were detected only in transgenic rice lines but not in untransformed rice. The abundance of AeMDHAR transcripts in transgenic lines MT22 and MT25 was approximately 2.75 times the amount found in MT24. The transgenic rice lines overexpressing AeMDHAR showed a significant increase in MDHAR enzyme activity compared to untransformed plants under both NaCl and control conditions. All transgenic lines showed better yield attributes such as a higher tiller number and increased 1000-grain weight compared to non-transgenics. They also showed tolerance to salt at germination and seedling stages. The transgenic line MT24, which harbors a single copy of AeMDHAR, displayed a lower rate of sterility, a higher number of tillers and longer panicle compared to untransformed plants when subjected to salt stress.
22111585	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis.	2012	Plant J	Tapetum development and meiosis play crucial roles in anther development. Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1), which controls the early stages of that development. This gene encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is present only in cereals. Our T-DNA insertion mutations gave rise to abnormal tapetal formation. Cellular organelles, especially the ER, were underdeveloped, which led to hampered differentiation and degeneration of the tapetum. In addition, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at the early stages of meiotic prophase I. RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that DTM1 transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes. Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant. Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants. These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
22080374	Quantitative trait loci for cold tolerance of rice recombinant inbred lines in low temperature environments.	2011	Mol Cells	Low temperature is one of the major environmental stresses in rice cultivation in high-altitude and high-latitude regions. In this study, we cultivated a set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Dasanbyeo (indica) / TR22183 (japonica) crosses in Yanji (high-latitude area), Kunming (high-altitude area), Chuncheon (cold water irrigation) and Suwon (normal) to evaluate the main effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and epistatic QTL (E-QTL) with regard to their interactions with environments for cold-related traits. Six QTLs for spikelet fertility (SF) were identified in three cold treatment locations. Among them, four QTLs on chromosomes 2, 7, 8, and 10 were validated by several near isogenic lines (NILs) under cold treatment in Chuncheon. A total of 57 QTLs and 76 E-QTLs for nine cold-related traits were identified as distributing on all 12 chromosomes; among them, 19 QTLs and E-QTLs showed significant interactions of QTLs and environments (QEIs). The total phenotypic variation explained by each trait ranged from 13.2 to 29.1% in QTLs, 10.6 to 29.0% in EQTLs, 2.2 to 8.8% in QEIs and 1.0% to 7.7% in E-QTL × environment interactions (E-QEIs). These results demonstrate that epistatic effects and QEIs are important properties of QTL parameters for cold tolerance at the reproductive stage. In order to develop cold tolerant varieties adaptable to wide-ranges of cold stress, a strategy facilitating marker-assisted selection (MAS) is being adopted to accumulate QTLs identified from different environments.
22080597	Euchromatic subdomains in rice centromeres are associated with genes and transcription.	2011	Plant Cell	The presence of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENH3, defines centromeric (CEN) chromatin, but poorly understood epigenetic mechanisms determine its establishment and maintenance. CEN chromatin is embedded within pericentromeric heterochromatin in most higher eukaryotes, but, interestingly, it can show euchromatic characteristics; for example, the euchromatic histone modification mark dimethylated H3 Lys 4 (H3K4me2) is uniquely associated with animal centromeres. To examine the histone marks and chromatin properties of plant centromeres, we developed a genomic tiling array for four fully sequenced rice (Oryza sativa) centromeres and used chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip to study the patterns of four euchromatic histone modification marks: H3K4me2, trimethylated H3 Lys 4, trimethylated H3 Lys 36, and acetylated H3 Lys 4, 9. The vast majority of the four histone marks were associated with genes located in the H3 subdomains within the centromere cores. We demonstrate that H3K4me2 is not a ubiquitous component of rice CEN chromatin, and the euchromatic characteristics of rice CEN chromatin are hallmarks of the transcribed sequences embedded in the centromeric H3 subdomains. We propose that the transcribed sequences located in rice centromeres may provide a barrier preventing loading of CENH3 into the H3 subdomains. The separation of CENH3 and H3 subdomains in the centromere core may be favorable for the formation of three-dimensional centromere structure and for rice centromere function.
21132530	Al toxicity leads to enhanced cell division and changed photosynthesis in Oryza rufipogon L.	2011	Mol Biol Rep	Oryza rufipogon L. (O. rufipogon) or a common wild rice, showed considerable aluminum (Al) tolerance. In this study, we examined the physiologic and genetic response of wild rice short term and long term to Al toxicity, respectively. In the short term study, morin staining, DAPI staining and aniline blue staining were used to detect Al distribution, cell division and callose production in the roots of O. rufipogon. The results indicated cell division could be enhanced by Al within low concentration range. In the long term study, we chose Oryza sativa L (O. sativa) (the close sib of O. rufipogon) as a reference. It showed that O. rufipogon grew better than O. sativa when treated with Al of 1.4 mmol/l concentration and also experienced a short period of root growth stimulation. This study gave some basic data to explain the mechanisms Oryza rufipogon L. developed to deal with Al and lay a good foundation to further study. SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) proved that transcripts of the small subunit of Rubisco and a Photosystem I P700 apoprotein were enhanced under long term Al treatment in wild rice. Further investigation via the assessment of the content of chlorophyll a, b indicated that the content of chlorophyll a, b in the leaves of O. rufipogon generally rose after Al treatment for 15 days. This indicated that intake of Al can affect photosynthesis of plant.
22105913	Mapping and characterization of seed dormancy QTLs using chromosome segment substitution lines in rice.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Seed dormancy--the temporary failure of a viable seed to germinate under favorable conditions--is a complex characteristic influenced by many genes and environmental factors. To detect the genetic factors associated with seed dormancy in rice, we conducted a QTL analysis using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from a cross between Nona Bokra (strong dormancy) and Koshihikari (weak dormancy). Comparison of the levels of seed dormancy of the CSSLs and their recurrent parent Koshihikari revealed that two chromosomal regions-on the short arms of chromosomes 1 and 6-were involved in the variation in seed dormancy. Further genetic analyses using an F(2) population derived from crosses between the CSSLs and Koshihikari confirmed the allelic differences and the chromosomal locations of three putative QTLs: Sdr6 on chromosome 1 and Sdr9 and Sdr10 on chromosome 6. The Nona Bokra alleles of the three QTLs were associated with decreased germination rate. We discuss the physiological features of the CSSLs and speculate on the possible mechanisms of dormancy in light of the newly detected QTLs.
22048639	Mapping and pyramiding of two major genes for resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens [Stål]) in the rice cultivar ADR52.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is one of the most serious and destructive pests of rice, and can be found throughout the rice-growing areas of Asia. To date, more than 24 major BPH-resistance genes have been reported in several Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivars and wild relatives. Here, we report the genetic basis of the high level of BPH resistance derived from an Indian rice cultivar, ADR52, which was previously identified as resistant to the whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera [Horváth]). An F(2) population derived from a cross between ADR52 and a susceptible cultivar, Taichung 65 (T65), was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Antibiosis testing showed that multiple loci controlled the high level of BPH resistance in this F(2) population. Further linkage analysis using backcross populations resulted in the identification of BPH-resistance (antibiosis) gene loci from ADR52. BPH25 co-segregated with marker S00310 on the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 6, and BPH26 co-segregated with marker RM5479 on the long arm of chromosome 12. To characterize the virulence of the most recently migrated BPH strain in Japan, preliminary near-isogenic lines (pre-NILs) and a preliminary pyramided line (pre-PYL) carrying BPH25 and BPH26 were evaluated. Although both pre-NILs were susceptible to the virulent BPH strain, the pre-PYL exhibited a high level of resistance. The pyramiding of resistance genes is therefore likely to be effective for increasing the durability of resistance against the new virulent BPH strain in Japan.
22134723	Leaf variegation in the rice zebra2 mutant is caused by photoperiodic accumulation of tetra-cis-lycopene and singlet oxygen.	2012	Mol Cells	In field conditions, the zebra2 (z2) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa) produces leaves with transverse pale-green/yellow stripes. It was recently reported that ZEBRA2 encodes carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) and that low levels of lutein, an essential carotenoid for non-photochemical quenching, cause leaf variegation in z2 mutants. However, we found that the z2 mutant phenotype was completely suppressed by growth under continuous light (CL; permissive) conditions, with concentrations of chlorophyll, carotenoids and chloroplast proteins at normal levels in z2 mutants under CL. In addition, three types of reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide [O₂⁻], hydrogen peroxide [H₂O₂], and singlet oxygen [¹O₂]) accumulated to high levels in z2 mutants grown under short-day conditions (SD; alternate 10-h light/14-h dark; restrictive), but do not accumulate under CL conditions. However, the levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in z2 leaves were much lower than normal in both permissive CL and restrictive SD growth conditions, indicating that deficiency of these two carotenoids is not responsible for the leaf variegation phenotype. We found that the CRTISO substrate tetra-Cis-lycopene accumulated during the dark periods under SD, but not under CL conditions. Its accumulation was also positively correlated with ¹O₂ levels generated during the light period, which consequently altered the expression of ¹O₂-responsive and cell death-related genes in the variegated z2 leaves. Taking these results together, we propose that the z2 leaf variegation can be largely attributed to photoperiodic accumulation of tetra-cis-lycopene and generation of excessive ¹O₂ under natural day-night conditions.
22110044	High-resolution mapping of open chromatin in the rice genome.	2012	Genome Res	Gene expression is controlled by the complex interaction of transcription factors binding to promoters and other regulatory DNA elements. One common characteristic of the genomic regions associated with regulatory proteins is a pronounced sensitivity to DNase I digestion. We generated genome-wide high-resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites from both seedling and callus tissues of rice (Oryza sativa). Approximately 25% of the DH sites from both tissues were found in putative promoters, indicating that the vast majority of the gene regulatory elements in rice are not located in promoter regions. We found 58% more DH sites in the callus than in the seedling. For DH sites detected in both the seedling and callus, 31% displayed significantly different levels of DNase I sensitivity within the two tissues. Genes that are differentially expressed in the seedling and callus were frequently associated with DH sites in both tissues. The DNA sequences contained within the DH sites were hypomethylated, consistent with what is known about active gene regulatory elements. Interestingly, tissue-specific DH sites located in the promoters showed a higher level of DNA methylation than the average DNA methylation level of all the DH sites located in the promoters. A distinct elevation of H3K27me3 was associated with intergenic DH sites. These results suggest that epigenetic modifications play a role in the dynamic changes of the numbers and DNase I sensitivity of DH sites during development.
22118877	Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and cell wall peroxidase are cooperatively involved in the extensive formation of ferulate network in cell walls of developing rice shoots.	2012	J Plant Physiol	The relationship between the formation of cell wall-bound ferulic acid (FA) and diferulic acid (DFA) and the change in activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX) was studied in rice shoots. The length and the fresh mass of shoots increased during the growth period from day 4 to 6, while coleoptiles ceased elongation growth on day 5. The amounts of FA and DFA isomers as well as cell wall polysaccharides continued to increase during the whole period. The activities of PAL and CW-PRX greatly increased in the same manner during the period. There were close correlations between the PAL activity and ferulate content or between the CW-PRX activity and DFA content. The expression levels of investigated genes for PAL and putative CW-PRX showed good accordance with the activities of these enzymes. These results suggest that increases in PAL and CW-PRX activities are cooperatively involved in the formation of ferulate network in cell walls of rice shoots and that investigated genes may be, at least in part, associated with the enzyme activities. The substantial increase in such network probably causes the maturation of cell walls and thus the cessation of elongation growth of coleoptiles.
21765177	Global analysis of expression profiles of rice receptor-like kinase genes.	2012	Mol Plant	The receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play critical roles in plant development and response to stress stimuli. By perceiving or sensing the extracellular signals, RLK activates the downstream signaling pathway through phosphorylating the specific targets. Up to now, only a few RLKs have been functionally identified, which are even fewer in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We here report the systemic analysis of the expression profiles of rice RLK coding genes in different tissues, with the emphasis on seed development and in response to both abiotic stress and plant hormones. The results showed that most rice RLK genes are expressed in two or more tissues, of which the RLCK-RLKs have a higher, while WAK- and SD-RLKs have a lower, expression level in the vegetative tissues than other subfamily members. Interestingly, the constitutively highly expressed RLKs in rice and Arabidopsis are conserved, which is consistent with the previous hypothesis that RLKs existed before the differentiation of monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants. Nearly one-third of the detected rice RLKs are expressed during seed development, and the RLCK-RLK members possess a higher percentage during the endosperm development, suggesting a novel function of RLCK-RLK members in endosperm development. Further analysis revealed that many RLK genes expressed during seed development are also regulated by abiotic stresses (cold, salt, or drought) or hormones, indicating that RLKs may take part in the stress-related signaling pathways such as dehydration of endosperm. These results provide informative insights into the RLK studies and will be helpful to reveal the global regulatory network controlling rice seed development.
21779386	Brown planthopper (N. lugens Stal) feeding behaviour on rice germplasm as an indicator of resistance.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) is a serious pest of rice in Asia. Development of novel control strategies can be facilitated by comparison of BPH feeding behaviour on varieties exhibiting natural genetic variation, and then elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of resistance.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: BPH feeding behaviour was compared on 12 rice varieties over a 12 h period using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) and honeydew clocks. Seven feeding behaviours (waveforms) were identified and could be classified into two phases. The first phase involved patterns of sieve element location including non penetration (NP), pathway (N1+N2+N3), xylem (N5) [21] and two new feeding waveforms, derailed stylet mechanics (N6) and cell penetration (N7). The second feeding phase consisted of salivation into the sieve element (N4-a) and sieve element sap ingestion (N4-b). Production of honeydew drops correlated with N4-b waveform patterns providing independent confirmation of this feeding behaviour.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall variation in feeding behaviour was highly correlated with previously published field resistance or susceptibility of the different rice varieties: BPH produced lower numbers of honeydew drops and had a shorter period of phloem feeding on resistant rice varieties, but there was no significant difference in the time to the first salivation (N4-b). These qualitative differences in behaviour suggest that resistance is caused by differences in sustained phloem ingestion, not by phloem location. Cluster analysis of the feeding and honeydew data split the 12 rice varieties into three groups: susceptible, moderately resistant and highly resistant. The screening methods that we have described uncover novel aspects of the resistance mechanism (or mechanisms) of rice to BPH and will in combination with molecular approaches allow identification and development of new control strategies.
21760901	Effects of triazole derivatives on strigolactone levels and growth retardation in rice.	2011	PLoS One	We previously discovered a lead compound for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis inhibitors, TIS13 (2,2-dimethyl-7-phenoxy-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)heptan-3-ol). Here, we carried out a structure-activity relationship study of TIS13 to discover more potent and specific SL biosynthesis inhibitor because TIS13 has a severe side effect at high concentrations, including retardation of the growth of rice seedlings. TIS108, a new TIS13 derivative, was found to be a more specific SL biosynthesis inhibitor than TIS13. Treatment of rice seedlings with TIS108 reduced SL levels in both roots and root exudates in a concentration-dependent manner and did not reduce plant height. In addition, root exudates of TIS108-treated rice seedlings stimulated Striga germination less than those of control plants. These results suggest that TIS108 has a potential to be applied in the control of root parasitic weeds germination.
21744228	Selection for low-temperature germinability on the short arm of chromosome 3 in rice cultivars adapted to Hokkaido, Japan.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	In plant breeding with intensive selection, the haplotype patterns in the targeted chromosomal regions may become monogenic among local populations with the most desirable combination of loci. This study demonstrated that the chromosomal region surrounding qLTG3-1 was under selection during rice breeding programs in a local region of Japan, Hokkaido. qLTG3-1 is a major quantitative trait loci controlling tolerance to low-temperature at the seed germination stage in rice, termed low-temperature germinability. A clear association between qLTG3-1 alleles and low-temperature germinability was detected among 64 rice cultivars from Hokkaido. The allele with a loss-of-function mutation seemed to be selected during rice breeding programs. Comparison of haplotype patterns along with the short arm of chromosome 3 revealed that the selection of qLTG3-1 alleles was focused on a distinct chromosomal region of at most 130 kb. In the short arm of chromosome 3, two major traits associated with the adaptability to local conditions have been identified; eating quality and heading date. This study demonstrated that recombinant haplotype patterns for these traits might shape the adaptability to local environmental conditions and market demands during rice breeding programs in addition to the selection of qLTG3-1 alleles. The present results provide new opportunities for the design of hybridization combinations based on the haplotype patterns of chromosomal regions under selection during rice breeding programs in local regions.
21792631	A major locus qS12, located in a duplicated segment of chromosome 12, causes spikelet sterility in an indica-japonica rice hybrid.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Chromosome segment duplications are integral in genome evolution by providing a source for the origin of new genes. In the rice genome, besides an ancient polyploidy event known in the rice common ancestor, it had been identified that there was a special segmental duplication involving chromosomes 11 and 12, but the biological role of this duplication remains unknown. In this study, by using a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and near isogenic lines (NILs) derived from the indica cultivar 9311 and japonica cultivar Nipponbare, a major QTL (qS12) resulting in hybrid male sterility was mapped within ~400 kb region adjacent to the special duplicated segment on the short arm of chromosome 12. Compared to the japonica cultivar Nipponbare, the two sides of the qS12 candidate region were inverted in the indica cultivar 9311. Among 47 of the 111 rice genotypes evaluated by molecular markers, the inverted sides were detected, and found completely homologous to indica cultivar 9311. These results suggested that the two inverted sides protect the sequence in the qS12 regions from recombination. On the short-arm of chromosome 12, two QTLs S-e and S25, in addition to qS12, were previously detected as a distinct segregation distortion and pollen semi-sterility loci. We propose these three hybrid sterility loci are the same locus, and the duplicated segment on chromosome 12 may play a prominent role in diversification, i.e., sub-speciation of cultivated rice.
21789706	Genetic interactions involved in the inhibition of heading by heading date QTL, Hd2 in rice under long-day conditions.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Heading date is the one of the most important traits in rice breeding, because it defines where rice can be cultivated and influences the expression of various agronomic traits. To examine the inhibition of heading by Heading date 2 (Hd2), previously detected on the distal end of chromosome 7's long arm by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we developed backcross inbred lines (BILs) from Koshihikari, a leading Japanese cultivar, and Hayamasari, an extremely early heading cultivar. The BILs were cultivated under natural field conditions in Tsukuba Japan, and under long-day (14.5 h), extremely long-day (18 h), and short-day (10 h) conditions. Combinations of several QTLs near Hd1, Hd2, Ghd7, Hd5, and Hd16 were detected under these four conditions. Analysis of advanced backcross progenies revealed genetic interactions between Hd2 and Hd16 and between Hd2 and Ghd7. In the homozygous Koshihikari genetic background at Hd16, inhibition of heading by the Koshihikari allele at Hd2 was smaller than that with the Hayamasari Hd16 allele. Similarly, in the homozygous Koshihikari genetic background at Ghd7, the difference in heading date caused by different alleles at Hd2 was smaller than in plants homozygous for the Hayamasari Ghd7 allele. Based on these results, we conclude that Hd2 and its genetic interactions play an important role in controlling heading under long-day conditions. In addition, QTLs near Hd2, Hd16, and Ghd7, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date.
21966570	Expression of non-symbiotic hemoglobin 1 and 2 genes in rice (Oryza sativa) embryonic organs.	2011	Commun Integr Biol	Rice (Oryza sativa) contains five copies of the non-symbiotic hemoglobin (hb) gene, namely hb1 to hb5. Previous analysis by RT-PCR revealed that rice hb1 expresses in roots and leaves and hb2 expresses in leaves. However, it is not known whether or not hb1 and hb2 express in rice embryonic organs. Here, we report the expression of hb1 and hb2 genes in rice embryonic organs using RT-PCR and specific oligos for Hb1 and Hb2. Our results indicate that hb1 and hb2 genes express in embryonic organs in rice growing under normal conditions. Specifically, hb1 expresses in rice embryos and seminal roots, and hb2 expresses in embryos, coleoptiles and seminal roots. These observations suggest that Hb1 and Hb2 coexist and function in rice embryonic organs.
21668602	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of α-amylase production in flooded rice plants.	2011	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) can successfully germinate and grow even when flooded. Rice varieties possessing the submergence 1A (Sub1A) gene display a distinct flooding-tolerant phenotype, associated with lower carbohydrate consumption and restriction of the fast-elongation phenotype typical of flooding-intolerant rice varieties. Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 15 (CIPK15) was recently indicated as a key regulator of α-amylases under oxygen deprivation, linked to both rice germination and flooding tolerance in adult plants. It is still unknown whether the Sub1A- and CIPK15-mediated pathways act as complementary processes for rice survival under O(2) deprivation. In adult plants Sub1A and CIPK15 may perhaps play an antagonistic role in terms of carbohydrate consumption, with Sub1A acting as a starch degradation repressor and CIPK15 as an activator. In this study, we analysed sugar metabolism in the stem of rice plants under water submergence by selecting cultivars with different traits associated with flooding survival. The relation between the Sub1A and the CIPK15 pathways was investigated. The results show that under O(2) deprivation, the CIPK15 pathway is repressed in the tolerant, Sub1A-containing, FR13A variety. CIPK15 is likely to play a role in the up-regulation of Ramy3D in flooding-intolerant rice varieties that display fast elongation under flooding and that do not possess Sub1A.
21784949	Rice MADS6 interacts with the floral homeotic genes SUPERWOMAN1, MADS3, MADS58, MADS13, and DROOPING LEAF in specifying floral organ identities and meristem fate.	2011	Plant Cell	AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes play essential roles in flower development, but whether and how they work with floral organ identity genes remain less understood. Here, we describe interactions of the rice (Oryza sativa) AGL6 gene MADS6 with other rice floral homeotic genes in flower development. Genetic analyses revealed that MADS6 specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral meristem determinacy redundantly with SUPERWOMAN1/MADS16 (B-gene) or MADS3 (C-gene). MADS6 was shown to define carpel/ovule development and floral determinacy by interacting with MADS13 (D-gene) and control the palea and floral meristem identities together with the YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF. Expression analyses revealed that the transcript levels of six B-, C-, and E-class genes were reduced in mads6-1 at the early flower developmental stage, suggesting that MADS6 is a key regulator of early flower development. Moreover, MADS6 can directly bind to a putative regulatory motif on MADS58 (C-gene), and mads6-1 mads58 displayed phenotypes similar to that of mads6-1. These results suggest that MADS6 is a key player in specifying flower development via interacting with other floral homeotic genes in rice, thus providing new insights into the mechanism by which flower development is controlled.
21793697	Genetic dissection of the resistance to Rice stripe virus present in the indica rice cultivar 'IR24'.	2011	Genome	Rice stripe disease, caused by Rice stripe virus (RSV) and transmitted by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallen), is one of the most serious viral diseases of rice in temperate East Asian production regions. Prior quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has established that Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica 'IR24' carries positive alleles at the three loci qSTV3, qSTV7, and qSTV11-i. Here, we report an advanced backcross analysis based on three selected chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), each predicted to carry one of these three QTL. Three sets of BC(4)F(2:3) populations were bred from a cross between the critical CSSL and its recurrent parent Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica 'Asominori'. Both qSTV3 and qSTV11-i were detected in their respective population, but qSTV7 was not. An allelic analysis based on a known carrier of the major RSV resistance gene Stvb-i, which is located on chromosome 11, showed that qSTV11-i was not allelic with Stvb-i. A large mapping population was used to delimit the location of qSTV11-i to a 73.6-kb region. The de novo markers developed for this purpose will be useful as marker-assisted selection tools in efforts to introduce qSTV11-i into breeding programmes aiming to improve the level of RSV resistance.
21792227	Complex genetic nature of sex-independent transmission ratio distortion in Asian rice species: the involvement of unlinked modifiers and sex-specific mechanisms.	2012	Heredity (Edinb)	Transmission ratio distortion (TRD), in which one allele is transmitted more frequently than the opposite allele, is presumed to act as a driving force in the emergence of a reproductive barrier. TRD acting in a sex-specific manner has been frequently observed in interspecific and intraspecific hybrids across a broad range of organisms. In contrast, sex-independent TRD (siTRD), which results from preferential transmission of one of the two alleles in the heterozygote through both sexes, has been detected in only a few plant species. We previously reported an S(6) locus-mediated siTRD, in which the S(6) allele from an Asian wild rice strain (Oryza rufipogon) was transmitted more frequently than the S(6)(a) allele from an Asian cultivated rice strain (O. sativa) through both male and female gametes in heterozygous plants. Here, we report on the effect of a difference in genetic background on S(6) locus-mediated siTRD, based on the analysis using near-isogenic lines and the original wild strain as a parental strain for crossing. We found that the degree of TRD through the male gametes varied depending on the genetic background of the female (pistil) plants. Despite the occurrence of TRD through both male and female gametes, abnormality was detected in ovules, but not in pollen grains, in the heterozygote. These results suggest the involvement of unlinked modifiers and developmentally distinct, sex-specific genetic mechanisms in S(6) locus-mediated siTRD, raising the possibility that siTRD driven by a single locus may be affected by multiple genetic factors harbored in natural populations.
21730357	Starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm requires the presence of either starch synthase I or IIIa.	2011	J Exp Bot	Starch synthase (SS) I and IIIa are the first and second largest components of total soluble SS activity, respectively, in developing japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm. To elucidate the distinct and overlapping functions of these enzymes, double mutants were created by crossing the ss1 null mutant with the ss3a null mutant. In the F(2) generation, two opaque seed types were found to have either the ss1ss1/SS3ass3a or the SS1ss1/ss3ass3a genotype. Phenotypic analyses revealed lower SS activity in the endosperm of these lines than in those of the parent mutant lines since these seeds had different copies of SSI and SSIIIa genes in a heterozygous state. The endosperm of the two types of opaque seeds contained the unique starch with modified fine structure, round-shaped starch granules, high amylose content, and specific physicochemical properties. The seed weight was ∼90% of that of the wild type. The amount of granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) and the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) were higher than in the wild type and parent mutant lines. The double-recessive homozygous mutant prepared from both ss1 and ss3a null mutants was considered sterile, while the mutant produced by the leaky ss1 mutant×ss3a null mutant cross was fertile. This present study strongly suggests that at least SSI or SSIIIa is required for starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.
21930100	Characterization of a novel high-tillering dwarf 3 mutant in rice.	2011	J Genet Genomics	Tiller number and culm length are important components of plant architecture and determinate grain production in rice. A line SIL046, derived from an introgression lines population developed by an accession of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) and a high-yielding indica cultivar Guichao 2 (Oryza sativa L.), exhibits a higher tiller number and shorter culm length phenotype than the recipient parent Guichao 2 (GC2). Genetic analysis showed that the high-tillering dwarf phenotype was controlled by a novel single recessive gene, referred to as the high-tillering dwarf 3 (htd3), which located within the genetic distance of 13.4 cM between SSR makers RM7003 and RM277 on chromosome 12. By means of fine-mapping strategy, we mapped HTD3 gene within the genetic distance of 2.5 cM and the physical distance of 3100 kb in the centromere of chromosome 12. Further identification of HTD3 gene would provide a new opportunity to uncover the molecular mechanism of the development of culm and tiller, two important components of yields in rice.
21960163	Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice.	2012	Planta	Aldehyde dehydrogenase proteins consist of a superfamily and the family 7 (ALDH7) is a typical group with highly conserved proteins across species. It catalyzes oxidation of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA) in lysine degradation, participates in protection against hyperosmotic stress, and detoxifies aldehydes in human; however, its function in plants has been much less documented. Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of OsALDH7. OsALDH7 is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds. We found that oryzamutaic acid A accumulated during late seed development and after a year-long storage in the colored endosperm, whereas it was undetectable in the wild type endosperm. Moreover, lysine degradation was enhanced in yeast over-expressing OsALDH7 and as a result, content of lysine, glutamate and saccharopine was changed, suggesting a role of OsALDH7 in lysine catabolism.
21937483	Ammonia emission from rice leaves in relation to photorespiration and genotypic differences in glutamine synthetase activity.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rice (Oryza sativa) plants lose significant amounts of volatile NH(3) from their leaves, but it has not been shown that this is a consequence of photorespiration. Involvement of photorespiration in NH(3) emission and the role of glutamine synthetase (GS) on NH(3) recycling were investigated using two rice cultivars with different GS activities.

METHODS: NH(3) emission (AER), and gross photosynthesis (P(G)), transpiration (Tr) and stomatal conductance (g(S)) were measured on leaves of 'Akenohoshi', a cultivar with high GS activity, and 'Kasalath', a cultivar with low GS activity, under different light intensities (200, 500 and 1000 µmol m(-2) s(-1)), leaf temperatures (27·5, 32·5 and 37·5 °C) and atmospheric O(2) concentrations ([O(2)]: 2, 21 and 40 %, corresponding to 20, 210 and 400 mmol mol(-1)).

KEY RESULTS: An increase in [O(2)] increased AER in the two cultivars, accompanied by a decrease in P(G) due to enhanced photorespiration, but did not greatly influence Tr and g(S). There were significant positive correlations between AER and photorespiration in both cultivars. Increasing light intensity increased AER, P(G), Tr and g(S) in both cultivars, whereas increasing leaf temperature increased AER and Tr but slightly decreased P(G) and g(S). 'Kasalath' (low GS activity) showed higher AER than 'Akenohoshi' (high GS activity) at high light intensity, leaf temperature and [O(2)].

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that photorespiration is strongly involved in NH(3) emission by rice leaves and suggest that differences in AER between cultivars result from their different GS activities, which would result in different capacities for reassimilation of photorespiratory NH(3). The results also suggest that NH(3) emission in rice leaves is not directly controlled by transpiration and stomatal conductance.
21852757	Multiple roles of nitrate transport accessory protein NAR2 in plants.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Two component high affinity nitrate transport system, NAR2/NRT2, has been defined in several plant species. In Arabidopsis, AtNAR2.1 has a role in the targeting of AtNRT2.1 to the plasma membrane. The gene knock out mutant atnar2.1 lacks inducible high-affinity transport system (IHATS) activity, it also shows the same inhibition of lateral root (LR) initiation on the newly developed primary roots as the atnrt2.1 mutant in response to low nitrate supply. In rice, OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake over high and low concentration ranges. In rice roots OsNAR2.1 and its partner NRT2s show some expression differences in both tissue specificity and abundance. It can be predicted that NAR2 plays multiple roles in addition to being an IHATS component in plants.
21971746	Expression analysis of a heat-inducible, Myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) gene from wheat and the alternatively spliced variants of rice and Arabidopsis.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Molecular dissection and a deeper analysis of the heat stress response mechanism in wheat have been poorly understood so far. This study delves into the molecular basis of action of TaMIPS, a heat stress-inducible enzyme that was identified through PCR-select subtraction technology, which is named here as TaMIPS2. MIPS (L-Myo-inositol-phosphate synthase) is important for the normal growth and development in plants. Expression profiling showed that TaMIPS2 is expressed during different developing seed stages upon heat stress. Also, the transcript levels increase in unfertilized ovaries and significant amounts are present during the recovery period providing evidence that MIPS is crucial for its role in heat stress recovery and flower development. Alternatively spliced forms from rice and Arabidopsis were also identified and their expression analysis revealed that apart from heat stress, some of the spliced variants were also inducible by drought, NaCl, Cold, ABA, BR, SA and mannitol. In silico promoter analysis revealed various cis-elements that could contribute for the differential regulation of MIPS in different plant systems. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MIPS are highly conserved among monocots and dicots and TaMIPS2 grouped specifically with monocots. Comparative analyses was undertaken by different experimental approaches, i.e., semi-quantitative RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, Genevestigator as a reference expression tool and motif analysis to predict the possible function of TaMIPS2 in regulating the different aspects of plant development under abiotic stress in wheat.
22043312	Molecular evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta in invasive weedy rice in the USA.	2011	PLoS One	The Pi-ta gene in rice has been effectively used to control rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae worldwide. Despite a number of studies that reported the Pi-ta gene in domesticated rice and wild species, little is known about how the Pi-ta gene has evolved in US weedy rice, a major weed of rice. To investigate the genome organization of the Pi-ta gene in weedy rice and its relationship to gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US, we analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Pi-ta gene and its surrounding 2 Mb region in 156 weedy, domesticated and wild rice relatives. We found that the region at and around the Pi-ta gene shows very low genetic diversity in US weedy rice. The patterns of molecular diversity in weeds are more similar to cultivated rice (indica and aus), which have never been cultivated in the US, rather than the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon. In addition, the resistant Pi-ta allele (Pi-ta) found in the majority of US weedy rice belongs to the weedy group strawhull awnless (SH), suggesting a single source of origin for Pi-ta. Weeds with Pi-ta were resistant to two M. oryzae races, IC17 and IB49, except for three accessions, suggesting that component(s) required for the Pi-ta mediated resistance may be missing in these accessions. Signatures of flanking sequences of the Pi-ta gene and SSR markers on chromosome 12 suggest that the susceptible pi-ta allele (pi-ta), not Pi-ta, has been introgressed from cultivated to weedy rice by out-crossing.
22078377	Differential salinity-induced variations in the activity of H⁺-pumps and Na⁺/H⁺ antiporters that are involved in cytoplasm ion homeostasis as a function of genotype and tolerance level in rice cell lines.	2011	Plant Physiol Biochem	The characterisation of cellular responses to salinity in staple crops is necessary for the reliable identification of physiological markers of salinity tolerance. Under saline conditions, variations in proton gradients that are generated by membrane-bound H⁺ pumps are crucial for maintaining cytoplasm homeostasis. We examined short (15 h) and longer term effects (4 days) of NaCl stress on the H⁺ pumping activities that are associated with the plasma membrane (P-ATPase) and the tonoplast (V-ATPase and V-PPase) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) callus lines that displayed different levels of NaCl tolerance and were established from two japonica rice cultivars. The applied stress conditions were based on those that were used in the induction of a stress-responsive polyubiquitin gene promoter (UBI1) in transgenic rice calli. The most remarkable effect of NaCl stress on H⁺ pumping was the rapid activation of tonoplast-bound pumps; this was particularly observed in cv. Bomba, in which the response of the P-ATPase was slower and showed a higher level of activity after 4 days of stress. The responses were cultivar-dependent; however, in general, a stronger activation occurred in the lines that had a higher tolerance (L-T) than in the less-tolerant (L-S) lines. Substrate hydrolysis was less affected than H⁺ pumping, and it yielded higher H⁺/substrate coupling ratios, which is indicative of an enhanced H⁺ pumping efficiency under saline conditions. The Na⁺/H⁺ antiport activity was generally limited to salt-stressed calli, and higher values and stronger activation of the tonoplast antiporter were observed in the L-T lines than in the L-S lines. The results that were obtained with the NaCl-stressed transgenic lines confirmed the close relationship between metabolic activity, H⁺ pumping and the induction of Na⁺/H⁺ exchange activities.
22038433	Development and characterization of japonica rice lines carrying the brown planthopper-resistance genes BPH12 and BPH6.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH) has become a severe constraint on rice production. Identification and pyramiding BPH-resistance genes is an economical and effective solution to increase the resistance level of rice varieties. All the BPH-resistance genes identified to date have been from indica rice or wild species. The BPH12 gene in the indica rice accession B14 is derived from the wild species Oryza latifolia. Using an F(2) population from a cross between the indica cultivar 93-11 and B14, we mapped the BPH12 gene to a 1.9-cM region on chromosome 4, flanked by the markers RM16459 and RM1305. In this population, BPH12 appeared to be partially dominant and explained 73.8% of the phenotypic variance in BPH resistance. A near-isogenic line (NIL) containing the BPH12 locus in the background of the susceptible japonica variety Nipponbare was developed and crossed with a NIL carrying BPH6 to generate a pyramid line (PYL) with both genes. BPH insects showed significant differences in non-preference in comparisons between the lines harboring resistance genes (NILs and PYL) and Nipponbare. BPH growth and development were inhibited and survival rates were lower on the NIL-BPH12 and NIL-BPH6 plants compared to the recurrent parent Nipponbare. PYL-BPH6 + BPH12 exhibited 46.4, 26.8 and 72.1% reductions in population growth rates (PGR) compared to NIL-BPH12, NIL-BPH6 and Nipponbare, respectively. Furthermore, insect survival rates were the lowest on the PYL-BPH6 + BPH12 plants. These results demonstrated that pyramiding different BPH-resistance genes resulted in stronger antixenotic and antibiotic effects on the BPH insects. This gene pyramiding strategy should be of great benefit for the breeding of BPH-resistant japonica rice varieties.
21984651	The failure to express a protein disulphide isomerase-like protein results in a floury endosperm and an endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	The rice somaclonal mutant T3612 produces small grains with a floury endosperm, caused by the loose packing of starch granules. The positional cloning of the mutation revealed a deletion in a gene encoding a protein disulphide isomerase-like enzyme (PDIL1-1). In the wild type, PDIL1-1 was expressed throughout the plant, but most intensely in the developing grain. In T3612, its expression was abolished, resulting in a decrease in the activity of plastidial phosphorylase and pullulanase, and an increase in that of soluble starch synthase I and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The amylopectin in the T3612 endosperm showed an increase in chains with a degree of polymerization 8-13 compared with the wild type. The expression in the mutant's endosperm of certain endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive genes was noticeably elevated. PDIL1-1 appears to play an important role in starch synthesis. Its absence is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in the endosperm, which is likely to underlie the formation of the floury endosperm in the T3612 mutant.
21338466	Rice plants expressing the moss sodium pumping ATPase PpENA1 maintain greater biomass production under salt stress.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	High cytosolic concentrations of Na+ inhibit plant growth and development. To maintain low cytosolic concentrations of Na+ , higher plants use membrane-bound transporters that drive the efflux of Na+ or partition Na+ ions from the cytosol, either to the extracellular compartment or into the vacuole. Bryophytes also use an energy-dependent Na+ pumping ATPase, not found in higher plants, to efflux Na+ . To investigate whether this transporter can increase the salt tolerance of crop plants, Oryza sativa has been transformed with the Physcomitrella patens Na+ pumping ATPase (PpENA1). When grown in solutions containing 50 mm NaCl, plants constitutively expressing the PpENA1 gene are more salt tolerant and produce greater biomass than controls. Transgenics and controls accumulate similar amounts of Na+ in leaf and root tissues under stress, which indicates that the observed tolerance is not because of Na+ exclusion. Moreover, inductively coupled plasma analysis reveals that the concentration of other ions in the transformants and the controls is similar. The transgenic lines are developmentally normal and fertile, and the transgene expression levels remain stable in subsequent generations. GFP reporter fusions, which do not alter the ability of PpENA1 to complement a salt-sensitive yeast mutant, indicate that when it is expressed in plant tissues, the PpENA1 protein is located in the plasma membrane. PpENA1 peptides are found in plasma membrane fractions supporting the plasma membrane targeting. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of PpENA1 as a potential tool for engineering salinity tolerance in important crop species.
22020279	Homeostatic response to hypoxia is regulated by the N-end rule pathway in plants.	2011	Nature	Plants and animals are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen for mitochondrial respiration and energy production. In plants, an unanticipated decline in oxygen availability (hypoxia), as caused by roots becoming waterlogged or foliage submergence, triggers changes in gene transcription and messenger RNA translation that promote anaerobic metabolism and thus sustain substrate-level ATP production. In contrast to animals, oxygen sensing has not been ascribed to a mechanism of gene regulation in response to oxygen deprivation in plants. Here we show that the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis acts as a homeostatic sensor of severe low oxygen levels in Arabidopsis, through its regulation of key hypoxia-response transcription factors. We found that plants lacking components of the N-end rule pathway constitutively express core hypoxia-response genes and are more tolerant of hypoxic stress. We identify the hypoxia-associated ethylene response factor group VII transcription factors of Arabidopsis as substrates of this pathway. Regulation of these proteins by the N-end rule pathway occurs through a characteristic conserved motif at the amino terminus initiating with Met-Cys. Enhanced stability of one of these proteins, HRE2, under low oxygen conditions improves hypoxia survival and reveals a molecular mechanism for oxygen sensing in plants via the evolutionarily conserved N-end rule pathway. SUB1A-1, a major determinant of submergence tolerance in rice, was shown not to be a substrate for the N-end rule pathway despite containing the N-terminal motif, indicating that it is uncoupled from N-end rule pathway regulation, and that enhanced stability may relate to the superior tolerance of Sub1 rice varieties to multiple abiotic stresses.
22131052	RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice.	2012	Mol Plant	Organisms can adjust their phenotype in response to changing environmental conditions. This phenomenon is termed phenotypic plasticity. Despite its ubiquitous occurrence, there has been very little study on the molecular mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, rice plasticity 1 (rpl1), that displayed increased environment-dependent phenotypic variations. RPL1 was expressed in all tissues examined. The protein was localized in the nucleus and its distribution in the nucleus overlapped with heterochromatin. The rpl1 mutation led to an increase in DNA methylation on repetitive sequences and a decrease in overall histone acetylation. In addition, the mutation affected responses of the rice plant to phytohormones such as brassinosteroid, gibberellin, and cytokinin. Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene. These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones.
22174619	Rice protein extracted by different methods affects cholesterol metabolism in rats due to its lower digestibility.	2011	Int J Mol Sci	To elucidate whether the digestibility is responsible for the hypocholesterolemic action of rice protein, the effects of rice proteins extracted by alkali (RP-A) and α-amylase (RP-E) on cholesterol metabolism were investigated in 7-week-old male Wistar rats fed cholesterol-free diets for 3 weeks. The in vitro and in vivo digestibility was significantly reduced by RP-A and RP-E as compared to casein (CAS). The digestibility was lower in RP-E than that of RP-A. Compared with CAS, the significant cholesterol-lowering effects were observed in rats fed by RP-A and RP-E. Fecal excretion of bile acids was significantly stimulated by RP-E, but not by RP-A. The apparent cholesterol absorption was more effectively inhibited by RP-E than RP-A because more fecal neutral sterols were excreted in rats fed RP-E. There was a significant correlation between protein digestibility and cholesterol absorption (r = 0.8662, P < 0.01), resulting in a significant correlation between protein digestibility and plasma cholesterol level (r = 0.7357, P < 0.01) in this study. The present study demonstrates that the digestibility of rice protein affected by extraction method plays a major role in the modulation of cholesterol metabolism. Results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic action induced by rice protein with lower digestibility primarily contribute to the inhibition of cholesterol absorption.
22017194	Differential metabolic regulation governed by the rice SUB1A gene during submergence stress and identification of alanylglycine by 1H NMR spectroscopy.	2012	J Proteome Res	Although the genetic mechanism of submergence survival for rice varieties containing the SUB1A gene has been elucidated, the downstream metabolic effects have not yet been evaluated. In this study, the metabolomes of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. M202 and cv. M202(Sub1) were profiled using (1)H NMR spectroscopy to compare the metabolic effect of submergence stress and recovery on rice in the presence or absence of SUB1A. Significant changes were observed in the NMR resonances of compounds in pathways important for carbohydrate metabolism. The presence of SUB1A in M202(Sub1) was correlated with suppression of carbohydrate metabolism in shoot tissue, consistent with the role of SUB1A in limiting starch catabolism to fuel elongation growth. The absence of SUB1A in M202 was correlated with greater consumption of sucrose stores and accumulation of amino acids that are synthesized from glycolysis intermediates and pyruvate. Under submergence conditions, alanine, a product of pyruvate metabolism, showed the largest difference between the two varieties, but elevated levels of glutamine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, and valine were also higher in M202 compared with the M202(Sub1) variety. The identification and characterization of alanylglycine (AlaGly) in rice is also reported. After 3 days of submergence stress, AlaGly levels decreased significantly in both genotypes but did not recover within 1 day of desubmergence with the other metabolites evaluated. The influence of SUB1A on dynamic changes in the metabolome during complete submergence provides new insights into the functional roles of a single gene in invoking a quiescence strategy that helps stabilize crop production in submergence-prone fields.
21739353	Intercellular production of tamavidin 1, a biotin-binding protein from Tamogitake mushroom, confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in transgenic rice.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, one of the most devastating rice pathogens in the world, shows biotin-dependent growth. We have developed a strategy for creating disease resistance to M. oryzae whereby intercellular production of tamavidin 1, a biotin-binding protein from Pleurotus cornucopiae occurs in transgenic rice plants. The gene that encodes tamavidin 1, fused to the sequence for a secretion signal peptide derived from rice chitinase gene, was connected to the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and the resultant construct was introduced into rice. The tamavidin 1 was accumulated at levels of 0.1-0.2% of total soluble leaf proteins in the transgenic rice and it was localized in the intercellular space of rice leaves. The tamavidin 1 purified from the transgenic rice was active, it bound to biotin and inhibited in vitro growth of M. oryzae by causing biotin deficiency. The transgenic rice plants showed a significant resistance to M. oryzae. This study shows the possibility of a new strategy to engineer disease resistance in higher plants by taking advantage of a pathogen's auxotrophy.
21600393	Identification of heterotic loci associated with yield-related traits in Chinese common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2011	Plant Sci	Many rice breeding programs have currently reached yield plateaus as a result of limited genetic variability in parental strains. Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is the progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and serves as an important gene pool for the genetic improvement of rice cultivars. In this study, heterotic loci (HLs) associated with six yield-related traits were identified in wild and cultivated rice and investigated using a set of 265 introgression lines (ILs) of O. rufipogon Griff. in the background of the Indica high-yielding cultivar Guichao 2 (O. sativa L.). Forty-two HLs were detected by a single point analysis of mid-parent heterosis values from test cross F(1) offspring, and 30 (71.5%) of these HLs showed significantly positive effects, consistent with the superiority shown by the F(1) test cross population in the six yield-related traits under study. Genetic mapping of hsp11, a locus responsible for the number of spikelets per panicle, confirmed the utility of these HLs. The results indicate that favorable HLs capable of improving agronomic traits are available. The identification of HLs between wild rice and cultivated rice could lead to a new strategy for the application of heterosis in rice breeding.
21931853	Biogenic hierarchical TiO₂/SiO₂ derived from rice husk and enhanced photocatalytic properties for dye degradation.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Rice husk, an agricultural bioresource, is utilized as a non-metallic bio-precursor to synthesize biogenic hierarchical TiO₂/SiO₂ (BH-TiO₂/SiO₂) and the products are applied to dye degradation.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The as-prepared BH-TiO₂/SiO₂ samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), nitrogen-adsorption measurement, UV-vis spectroscopy and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results show that BH-TiO₂/SiO₂ possesses both anatase and rutile phases with amorphous SiO₂ as background, which contains mesopore structure, and nitrogen derived from original rice husk is self-doped into the lattice. Besides, the light-harvesting within the visible-light range of BH-TiO₂/SiO₂ has been enhanced. Moreover, the catalytic activity of BH-TiO₂/SiO₂ has been proven by EPR, and both the photocatalytic activity and stability of BH-TiO₂/SiO₂ are improved as well, which has been illustrated by cycled degradation of methylene blue dye under irradiation.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides a good way to combine natural hierarchical porous structure with synthetic material chemistry based on available biomass in the vast natural environment for the sustainable development of human society, and extends potentials of biomass in applications such as photocatalysts, sunlight splitting water and so forth.
21921697	The role of rice phenolics efflux transporter in solubilizing apoplasmic iron.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plants whose deficiency presents a major worldwide agricultural problem. Moreover, Fe is not easily available in neutral to alkaline soils, rendering plants deficient in Fe despite its abundance. Plants secrete phenolics, such as protocatechuic acid (PCA) and caffeic acid (CA), to take up and utilize apoplasmic precipitated Fe, but despite the rapid progress in understanding cellular and subcellular Fe transport, the molecular mechanisms of phenolics synthesis and secretion are not clear. Recently, we isolated and characterized a phenolics efflux transporter in rice by characterizing a mutant in which the amount of PCA and CA in the xylem sap was dramatically reduced, which we hence named phenolics efflux zero 1 (pez1). PEZ1 is a plasma membrane protein that transports PCA when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and characterization of PEZ1 knockdown and overexpressing plants revealed that it plays an essential role in solubilizing precipitated apoplasmic Fe. The identification of PEZ1 will increase our understanding of apoplasmic Fe solubilization as well as promote research on phenolics efflux mechanisms in different organisms.
21829379	A rice plastidial nucleotide sugar epimerase is involved in galactolipid biosynthesis and improves photosynthetic efficiency.	2011	PLoS Genet	Photosynthesis is the final determinator for crop yield. To gain insight into genes controlling photosynthetic capacity, we selected from our large T-DNA mutant population a rice stunted growth mutant with decreased carbon assimilate and yield production named photoassimilate defective1 (phd1). Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that PHD1 encodes a novel chloroplast-localized UDP-glucose epimerase (UGE), which is conserved in the plant kingdom. The chloroplast localization of PHD1 was confirmed by immunoblots, immunocytochemistry, and UGE activity in isolated chloroplasts, which was approximately 50% lower in the phd1-1 mutant than in the wild type. In addition, the amounts of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose substrates in chloroplasts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, indicating that PHD1 was responsible for a major part of UGE activity in plastids. The relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane galactolipid, was decreased in the mutant, while the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) amount was not significantly altered, suggesting that PHD1 participates mainly in UDP-galactose supply for MGDG biosynthesis in chloroplasts. The phd1 mutant showed decreased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and altered chloroplast ultrastructure, suggesting that a correct amount of galactoglycerolipids and the ratio of glycolipids versus phospholipids are necessary for proper chloroplast function. Downregulated expression of starch biosynthesis genes and upregulated expression of sucrose cleavage genes might be a result of reduced photosynthetic activity and account for the decreased starch and sucrose levels seen in phd1 leaves. PHD1 overexpression increased photosynthetic efficiency, biomass, and grain production, suggesting that PHD1 plays an important role in supplying sufficient galactolipids to thylakoid membranes for proper chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity. These findings will be useful for improving crop yields and for bioenergy crop engineering.
21769472	Identification of potential antisense transcripts in rice using conventional microarray.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are endogenous transcripts that contain reverse complementary sequences to other RNAs (usually called sense transcripts). NATs regulate the expression of sense transcripts in a wide range of species. The identification and analysis of NATs are the prerequisite to elucidate their functions. Microarray is a genome-wide method to detect gene expression. However, conventional microarrays do not contain the specific probes of NATs; thus, they cannot be utilized to detect NATs. In this article, we developed a novel method to identify potential NATs with the conventional microarrays. In this method of our study, we labeled the first strand cDNA from one sample with Cy5 and labeled the second strand cDNA from another sample with Cy3, and then hybridized these labeled samples with oligonucleotide microarray. Using this method, we identified 920 potential NATs in rice variety Nipponbare. Among these potential NATs, 88 of them were confirmed by either full-length cDNA or orientated ESTs (expressed sequence tags). This is the first time that a conventional oligonucleotide microarray was employed to identify NATs in rice.
21605341	Characterization and genetic analysis of a light- and temperature-sensitive spotted-leaf mutant in rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	A rice spotted-leaf mutant was isolated from an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) -induced IR64 mutant bank. The mutant, designated as spl30 (spotted-leaf30), displayed normal green leaf color under shade but exhibited red-brown lesions under natural summer field conditions. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light and the symptom was enhanced at 33 (°) C relative to 26 (°) C. Histochemical staining did not show cell death around the red-brown lesions. Chlorophyll contents in the mutant were significantly lower than those of the wild type while the ratio of chlorophyll a/b remained the same, indicating that spl30 was impaired in biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll. Disease reaction patterns of the mutant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae were largely unchanged to most races tested except for a few strains. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named spl30(t), which co-segregated with RM15380 on chromosome 3, and was delimited to a 94 kb region between RM15380 and RM15383. Spl30(t) is likely a novel rice spotted-leaf gene since no other similar genes have been identified near the chromosomal region. The genetic data and recombination populations provided in this study will enable further fine-mapping and cloning of the gene.
21811828	ZmCBF3 overexpression improves tolerance to abiotic stress in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) without yield penalty.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Plant productivity is greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought, salt, and freezing. We previously described a C-repeat binding transcription factor from maize (ZmCBF3) that was upregulated by both abscisic acid and low-temperature and actively expressed during embryogenesis. To understand the stress response in rice, transgenic ZmCBF3 rice with ubiquitin promoter was developed. T3 generation was planted and analyzed. The results showed that overexpression of ZmCBF3 in rice did not cause growth retardation under normal growth conditions with improved tolerance to drought, high-salt, and low-temperature stresses. Moreover, the transgenic rice grain yield was similar to wild type plants under normal conditions. The transgenic plants showed enhanced survival rate and reduced malondialdehyde content and relative conductivity under drought, salt, and low-temperature stresses. ZmCBF3 overexpression in transgenic rice increased the transcript levels of stress-induced genes and enhanced the tolerance to drought, salt, and low-temperature stresses.
21879323	Comparative analysis of evolutionary dynamics of genes encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase between rice and Arabidopsis.	2011	Genetica	The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase (RLK) proteins constitute a large superfamily in the plant genome, and carry out key functions in a variety of biological pathways. In an effort to determine the evolutionary fate of members of a large gene family such as plant LRR RLK proteins we conducted in silico analysis using complete genome sequencing datasets, genome-wide transcriptome databases, and bioinformatics tools. A total of 292 and 165 LRR RLK genes were retrieved from the rice and Arabidopsis genomes, respectively, formed by diverse duplication events for gene expansion. The phylogenic analyses of the LRR RLK genes suggested combinations of LRR domains and RLK domains in the ancient plant genome prior to the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis, followed by massive independent expansions during speciation. The somewhat high frequencies (50-73%) of expressional divergence of members of duplicate gene pairs formed by whole/segmental genome duplication (W/SGD) and tandem duplication (TD) events of Arabidopsis and TD events of rice support the idea of their functional diversity for gene retention. By contrast, a relatively low degree (at least 20%) of members of rice LRR RLK gene pairs formed by W/SGD appear to be divergent in expression following the duplication event. At least 7 pairs of co-expressed gene clusters, including each of the tentative orthologous LRR RLK genes between rice and Arabidopsis, were enriched to an orthologous set between members of each of the pairs as compared to those of the random pairs, suggesting some degree of functional conservation of individual genes. These results may shed some light on the crucial functions of the plant LRR RLK genes with regard to a variety of biological processes.
21824678	Expression analysis of the gene family associated with raffinose accumulation in rice seedlings under cold stress.	2011	J Plant Physiol	A considerable increase in the concentration of raffinose was detected in rice seedlings exposed to chilling for more than 4 days. The content of raffinose in leaf blades increased from hardly detectable levels (0-1 days) to approximately 9 mg/g FW after 11 days of chilling treatment. Accumulation occurred in leaf blades but not in sheaths. Analysis of the expression of candidate genes related to galactinol and raffinose synthesis revealed that transcript levels of two galactinol synthase and four raffinose synthase genes increased in leaf blades before the accumulation of raffinose became detectable.
21790181	Experimental and computational investigations of oxygen reactivity in a heme and tyrosyl radical-containing fatty acid α-(di)oxygenase.	2011	Biochemistry	Rice α-(di)oxygenase mediates the regio- and stereospecific oxidation of fatty acids using a persistent catalytic tyrosyl radical. Experiments conducted in the physiological O(2) concentration range, where initial hydrogen atom abstraction from the fatty acid occurs in a kinetically reversible manner, are described. Our findings indicate that O(2)-trapping of an α-carbon radical is likely to reversibly precede reduction of a 2-(R)-peroxyl radical intermediate in the first irreversible step. A mechanism of concerted proton-coupled electron transfer is proposed on the basis of natural abundance oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, and calculations at the density functional level of theory, which predict a polarized transition state in which electron transfer is advanced to a greater extent than proton transfer. The approach outlined should be useful for identifying mechanisms of concerted proton-coupled electron transfer in a variety of oxygen-utilizing enzymes.
21829395	Genetic architecture of aluminum tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) determined through genome-wide association analysis and QTL mapping.	2011	PLoS Genet	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a primary limitation to crop productivity on acid soils, and rice has been demonstrated to be significantly more Al tolerant than other cereal crops. However, the mechanisms of rice Al tolerance are largely unknown, and no genes underlying natural variation have been reported. We screened 383 diverse rice accessions, conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study, and conducted QTL mapping in two bi-parental populations using three estimates of Al tolerance based on root growth. Subpopulation structure explained 57% of the phenotypic variation, and the mean Al tolerance in Japonica was twice that of Indica. Forty-eight regions associated with Al tolerance were identified by GWA analysis, most of which were subpopulation-specific. Four of these regions co-localized with a priori candidate genes, and two highly significant regions co-localized with previously identified QTLs. Three regions corresponding to induced Al-sensitive rice mutants (ART1, STAR2, Nrat1) were identified through bi-parental QTL mapping or GWA to be involved in natural variation for Al tolerance. Haplotype analysis around the Nrat1 gene identified susceptible and tolerant haplotypes explaining 40% of the Al tolerance variation within the aus subpopulation, and sequence analysis of Nrat1 identified a trio of non-synonymous mutations predictive of Al sensitivity in our diversity panel. GWA analysis discovered more phenotype-genotype associations and provided higher resolution, but QTL mapping identified critical rare and/or subpopulation-specific alleles not detected by GWA analysis. Mapping using Indica/Japonica populations identified QTLs associated with transgressive variation where alleles from a susceptible aus or indica parent enhanced Al tolerance in a tolerant Japonica background. This work supports the hypothesis that selectively introgressing alleles across subpopulations is an efficient approach for trait enhancement in plant breeding programs and demonstrates the fundamental importance of subpopulation in interpreting and manipulating the genetics of complex traits in rice.
21801300	Production of recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor in rice cell suspension culture with a human-like N-glycan structure.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	The rice α-amylase 3D promoter system, which is activated under sucrose-starved conditions, has emerged as a useful system for producing recombinant proteins. However, using rice as the production system for therapeutic proteins requires modifications of the N-glycosylation pattern because of the potential immunogenicity of plant-specific sugar residues. In this study, glyco-engineered rice were generated as a production host for therapeutic glycoproteins, using RNA interference (RNAi) technology to down-regulate the endogenous α-1,3-fucosyltransferase (α-1,3-FucT) and β-1,2-xylosyltransferase (β-1,2-XylT) genes. N-linked glycans from the RNAi lines were identified, and their structures were compared with those isolated from a wild-type cell suspension. The inverted-repeat chimeric RNA silencing construct of α-1,3-fucosyltransferase and β-1,2-xylosyltransferase (Δ3FT/XT)-9 glyco-engineered line with significantly reduced core α-1,3-fucosylated and/or β-1,2-xylosylated glycan structures was established. Moreover, levels of plant-specific α-1,3-fucose and/or β-1,2-xylose residues incorporated into recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) produced from the N44 + Δ3FT/XT-4 glyco-engineered line co-expressing ihpRNA of Δ3FT/XT and hGM-CSF were significantly decreased compared with those in the previously reported N44-08 transgenic line expressing hGM-CSF. None of the glyco-engineered lines differed from the wild type with respect to cell division, proliferation or ability to secrete proteins into the culture medium.
22133686	Development of upland rice introgression lines and identification of QTLs for basal root thickness under different water regimes.	2011	J Genet Genomics	Introgression lines (ILs) are valuable materials for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs), evaluating genetic interactions, and marker assisted breeding. A set of 430 ILs (BC(5)F(3)) containing segments from upland tropical japonica cultivar IRAT109 in a lowland temperate japonica cultivar Yuefu background were developed. One hundred and seventy-six polymorphic markers were used to identify introgressed segments. No segment from IRAT109 was found in 160 lines. Introgressed segments of the other 270 lines covered 99.1% of the donor genome. The mean number of introgressed donor segments per individual was 3.3 with an average length of 14.4 cM. QTL analysis was conducted on basal root thickness (BRT) of the 270 ILs grown under irrigated lowland, upland and hydroponic conditions. A total of 22 QTLs affecting BRT were identified, six QTLs (qBRT3.1, qBRT3.2, qBRT6.1, qBRT8.2, qBRT9.1, and qBRT9.2) were consistently expressed under at least two environments (location and water regime), and qBRT7.2 was a new BRT QTL identified under lowland conditions. IL255 containing qBRT9.1 showed an increase of 10.09% and 7.07% BRT over cultivar Yuefu when grown under upland and lowland conditions, respectively. Using a population of 304 F(2:3) lines derived from the cross IL255×Yuefu, qBRT9.1 was validated and mapped to a 1.2 cM interval between RM24271 and RM566. The presence of qBRT9.1 explained 12% of BRT variation. The results provide upland rice ILs and BRT QTLs for analyzing the genetic basis of drought resistance, detecting favorable genes from upland rice, and rice drought resistance breeding.
21884550	Tryptamine 5-hydroxylase-deficient Sekiguchi rice induces synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptophan and N-acetyltryptamine but decreases melatonin biosynthesis during senescence process of detached leaves.	2012	J Pineal Res	Melatonin biosynthesis was examined in Sekiguchi mutant rice lacking functional tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H) activity, which is the terminal enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis in rice. During senescence process, the leaves of Sekiguchi mutant rice produced more tryptamine and N-acetyltryptamine compared with the wild-type Asahi leaves. Even though T5H activity is absent, Sekiguchi leaves produce low levels of serotonin derived from 5-hydroxytryptophan, which was found to be synthesized during senescence process. Accordingly, both rice cultivars exhibited similar levels of N-acetylserotonin until 6 days of senescence induction; however, only Asahi leaves continued to accumulate N-acetylserotonin after 6 days. In contrast, a large amount of N-acetyltryptamine was accumulated in Sekiguchi leaves, indicating that tryptamine was efficiently utilized as substrate by the rice arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase enzyme. An increase in N-acetyltryptamine in Sekiguchi had an inhibitory effect on synthesis of melatonin because little melatonin was produced in Sekiguchi leaves at 6 days of senescence induction, even in the presence of equivalent levels of N-acetylserotonin in both cultivars. The exogenous treatment of 0.1 mmN-acetyltryptamine during senescence process completely blocked melatonin synthesis.
21901484	MoDUO1, a Duo1-like gene, is required for full virulence of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2011	Curr Genet	Duo1, a major component of the Dam1 complex which has been found in two species of yeast (the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe), is involved in mitosis-related chromosome segregation, while its relevance to pathogenicity in filamentous fungi remains unclear. This report elucidated this very fact in the case of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. A gene designated MoDUO1 that encodes a Duo1-like homolog (MoDuo1) was discovered in the M. oryzae genome. Two types of MoDUO1 mutants were obtained using genetic approaches of Agrobacterium-mediated gene disruption and homologous recombination. Both disruption and deletion of MoDUO1 can exert profound effects on the formation pattern of conidiophores and conidial morphology, such as abnormal nucleic numbers in conidia and delayed extension of infectious hyphae. Intriguingly, plant infection assays demonstrated that inactivation of MoDUO1 significantly attenuates the virulence in its natural host rice leaves, and functional complementation can restore it. Subcellular localization assays showed that MoDuo1 is mainly distributed in the cytosol of fungal cells. Proteomics-based investigation revealed that the expression of four mitosis-related proteins is shut down in the MoDUO1 mutant, suggesting that MoDuo1 may have a function in mitosis. In light of the fact that Duo1 orthologs are widespread in plant and human fungal pathogens, our finding may represent a common mechanism underlying fungal virulence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of linking a Duo1-like homolog to the pathogenesis of a pathogenic fungus, which might provide clues to additional studies on the role of Dam1 complex in M. oryzae and its interaction with rice.
21954158	Opaque7 encodes an acyl-activating enzyme-like protein that affects storage protein synthesis in maize endosperm.	2011	Genetics	In maize, a series of seed mutants with starchy endosperm could increase the lysine content by decreased amount of zeins, the main storage proteins in endosperm. Cloning and characterization of these mutants could reveal regulatory mechanisms for zeins accumulation in maize endosperm. Opaque7 (o7) is a classic maize starchy endosperm mutant with large effects on zeins accumulation and high lysine content. In this study, the O7 gene was cloned by map-based cloning and confirmed by transgenic functional complementation and RNAi. The o7-ref allele has a 12-bp in-frame deletion. The four-amino-acid deletion caused low accumulation of o7 protein in vivo. The O7 gene encodes an acyl-activating enzyme with high similarity to AAE3. The opaque phenotype of the o7 mutant was produced by the reduction of protein body size and number caused by a decrease in the α-zeins concentrations. Analysis of amino acids and metabolites suggested that the O7 gene might affect amino acid biosynthesis by affecting α-ketoglutaric acid and oxaloacetic acid. Transgenic rice seeds containing RNAi constructs targeting the rice ortholog of maize O7 also produced lower amounts of seed proteins and displayed an opaque endosperm phenotype, indicating a conserved biological function of O7 in cereal crops. The cloning of O7 revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for storage protein synthesis and highlighted an effective target for the genetic manipulation of storage protein contents in cereal seeds.
21284800	Cytokinin-mediated source/sink modifications improve drought tolerance and increase grain yield in rice under water-stress.	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought is the major environmental factor limiting crop productivity worldwide. We hypothesized that it is possible to enhance drought tolerance by delaying stress-induced senescence through the stress-induced synthesis of cytokinins in crop-plants. We generated transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants expressing an isopentenyltransferase (IPT) gene driven by P(SARK) , a stress- and maturation-induced promoter. Plants were tested for drought tolerance at two yield-sensitive developmental stages: pre- and post-anthesis. Under both treatments, the transgenic rice plants exhibited delayed response to stress with significantly higher grain yield (GY) when compared to wild-type plants. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant shift in expression of hormone-associated genes in the transgenic plants. During water-stress (WS), P(SARK)::IPT plants displayed increased expression of brassinosteroid-related genes and repression of jasmonate-related genes. Changes in hormone homeostasis were associated with resource(s) mobilization during stress. The transgenic plants displayed differential expression of genes encoding enzymes associated with hormone synthesis and hormone-regulated pathways. These changes and associated hormonal crosstalk resulted in the modification of source/sink relationships and a stronger sink capacity of the P(SARK)::IPT plants during WS. As a result, the transgenic plants had higher GY with improved quality (nutrients and starch content).
21984925	Comparison of four ChIP-Seq analytical algorithms using rice endosperm H3K27 trimethylation profiling data.	2011	PLoS One	Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput DNA Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for genome wide profiling of the binding sites of proteins associated with DNA such as histones and transcription factors. However, no peak calling program has gained consensus acceptance by the scientific community as the preferred tool for ChIP-Seq data analysis. Analyzing the large data sets generated by ChIP-Seq studies remains highly challenging for most molecular biology laboratories.Here we profile H3K27me3 enrichment sites in rice young endosperm using the ChIP-Seq approach and analyze the data using four peak calling algorithms (FindPeaks, PeakSeq, USeq, and MACS). Comparison of the four algorithms reveals that these programs produce very different peaks in terms of peak size, number, and position relative to genes. We verify the peak predictions using ChIP-PCR to evaluate the accuracy of peak prediction of the four algorithms. We discuss the approach of each algorithm and compare similarities and differences in the results. Despite their differences in the peaks identified, all of the programs reach similar conclusions about the effect of H3K27me3 on gene expression. Its presence either upstream or downstream of a gene is predominately associated with repression of the gene. Additionally, GO analysis finds that a substantially higher ratio of genes associated with H3K27me3 were involved in multicellular organism development, signal transduction, response to external and endogenous stimuli, and secondary metabolic pathways than the rest of the rice genome.
21274659	Improved FLP recombinase, FLPe, efficiently removes marker gene from transgene locus developed by Cre-lox mediated site-specific gene integration in rice.	2011	Mol Biotechnol	Site-specific recombination systems, such as FLP-FRT and Cre-lox, carry out precise recombination reactions on their respective targets in plant cells. This has led to the development of two important applications in plant biotechnology: marker-gene deletion and site-specific gene integration. To draw benefits of both applications, it is necessary to implement them in a single transformation process. In order to develop this new process, the present study evaluated the efficiency of FLP-FRT system for excising marker gene from the transgene locus developed by Cre-lox mediated site-specific integration in rice. Two different FLP recombinases, the wild-type FLP (FLPwt) and its thermostable derivative, FLPe, were used for the excision of marker gene flanked by FLP recombination targets (FRT). While marker excision mediated by FLPwt was undetectable, use of FLPe resulted in efficient marker excision in a number of transgenic lines, with the relative efficiency reaching up to ~100%. Thus, thermo-stability of FLP recombinase in rice cells is critical for efficient site-specific recombination, and use of FLPe offers practical solutions to FLP-FRT-based biotechnology applications in plants.
21848656	Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I via chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex performs a significant physiological role during photosynthesis and plant growth at low temperature in rice.	2011	Plant J	The role of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I in photosynthetic regulation and plant growth at several temperatures was examined in rice (Oryza sativa) that is defective in CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION 6 (CRR6), which is required for accumulation of sub-complex A of the chloroplast NDH complex (crr6). NdhK was not detected by Western blot analysis in crr6 mutants, resulting in lack of a transient post-illumination increase in chlorophyll fluorescence, and confirming that crr6 mutants lack NDH activity. When plants were grown at 28 or 35°C, all examined photosynthetic parameters, including the CO(2) assimilation rate and the electron transport rate around photosystems I and II, at each growth temperature at light intensities above growth light (i.e. 800 μmol photons m(-2) sec(-1)), were similar between crr6 mutants and control plants. However, when plants were grown at 20°C, all the examined photosynthetic parameters were significantly lower in crr6 mutants than control plants, and this effect on photosynthesis caused a corresponding reduction in plant biomass. The F(v)/F(m) ratio was only slightly lower in crr6 mutants than in control plants after short-term strong light treatment at 20°C. However, after long-term acclimation to the low temperature, impairment of cyclic electron flow suppressed non-photochemical quenching and promoted reduction of the plastoquinone pool in crr6 mutants. Taken together, our experiments show that NDH-dependent cyclic electron flow plays a significant physiological role in rice during photosynthesis and plant growth at low temperature.
22039121	Generation of transgenic rice lines with reduced contents of multiple potential allergens using a null mutant in combination with an RNA silencing method.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice seed proteins are known to be a causative antigen in some patients with food allergy, especially cereal allergy, with clinical symptoms such as eczema and dermatitis. The α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors (14-16 kDa), α-globulin (26 kDa) and β-glyoxalase I (33 kDa) are regarded as major potential allergens of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seed based on specific recognition by serum IgE from allergy patients. In order to suppress the production of these major allergens in rice grains, a mutant in the 'Koshihikari' background lacking the 26 kDa allergen (GbN-1) was used as a host for RNA silencing. A binary vector harboring two RNA interference (RNAi) gene cassettes for suppression of 14-16 kDa and 33 kDa allergens driven by the 13 kDa and 10 kDa prolamin endosperm-specific promoters, respectively, was introduced into the GbN-1 genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In the most promising transgenic line, the content of the three potential allergens was remarkably reduced to a very faint level without a change in seed phenotype. IgE binding of 15 patients' sera to the transgenic rice seed mostly deficient in the three major allergens was on average only about 10% that of the control wild-type rice, suggesting that these three accounted for the great majority of rice seed causative allergens recognized by patients' IgE and that the sequential allergen deletion/reduction strategy works in the development of hypo-allergenic rice lines.
22016430	Expression of the maize ZmGF14-6 gene in rice confers tolerance to drought stress while enhancing susceptibility to pathogen infection.	2012	J Exp Bot	14-3-3 proteins are found in all eukaryotes where they act as regulators of diverse signalling pathways associated with a wide range of biological processes. In this study the functional characterization of the ZmGF14-6 gene encoding a maize 14-3-3 protein is reported. Gene expression analyses indicated that ZmGF14-6 is up-regulated by fungal infection and salt treatment in maize plants, whereas its expression is down-regulated by drought stress. It is reported that rice plants constitutively expressing ZmGF14-6 displayed enhanced tolerance to drought stress which was accompanied by a stronger induction of drought-associated rice genes. However, rice plants expressing ZmGF14-6 either in a constitutive or under a pathogen-inducible regime showed a higher susceptibility to infection by the fungal pathogens Fusarium verticillioides and Magnaporthe oryzae. Under infection conditions, a lower intensity in the expression of defence-related genes occurred in ZmGF14-6 rice plants. These findings support that ZmGF14-6 positively regulates drought tolerance in transgenic rice while negatively modulating the plant defence response to pathogen infection. Transient expression assays of fluorescently labelled ZmGF14-6 protein in onion epidermal cells revealed a widespread distribution of ZmGF14-6 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, colocalization experiments of fluorescently labelled ZmGF14-6 with organelle markers, in combination with cell labelling with the endocytic tracer FM4-64, revealed a subcellular localization of ZmGF14-6 in the early endosomes. Taken together, these results improve our understanding of the role of ZmGF14-6 in stress signalling pathways, while indicating that ZmGF14-6 inversely regulates the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
22089543	Genome characterization of a breeding line derived from a cross between Oryza sativa and Oryza rufipogon.	2012	Biochem Genet	A preliminary screening was conducted on BC3F1 and BC4F1 backcross families developed from crossing Oryza sativa (MR219) and O. rufipogon (IRGC105491). Despite earlier results showing that O. rufipogon alleles (wild introgression) contributed to both number of panicles (qPPL-2) and tillers (qTPL-2) at loci RM250, RM208, and RM48 in line A20 of the BC2F2 population, we observed that wild introgression was lost at loci RM250 and RM208 but retained at locus RM48 in BC3F1 and BC4F1. Progeny tests conducted utilizing genotype and phenotype data on both BC4F1 and a reference population, BC2F7 (A20 line), did not show significant differences between groups having the MR219 allele and wild introgression at locus RM48. This suggests that there is no additive and transgressive effect of wild introgression in the BC3F1 and BC4F1 generated. The presence of wild introgression was largely due to gene contamination by cross-pollination during field breeding practices.
22107880	Expressing ScACR3 in rice enhanced arsenite efflux and reduced arsenic accumulation in rice grains.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice grain poses a serious health risk to populations with high rice consumption. Extrusion of arsenite [As(III)] by ScAcr3p is the major arsenic detoxification mechanism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, ScAcr3p homolog is absent in higher plants, including rice. In this study, ScACR3 was introduced into rice and expressed under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. In the transgenic lines, As concentrations in shoots and roots were about 30% lower than in the wild type, while the As translocation factors were similar between transgenic lines and the wild type. The roots of transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher As efflux activities than those of the wild type. Within 24 h exposure to 10 μM arsenate [As(V)], roots of ScACR3-expressing plants extruded 80% of absorbed As(V) to the external solution as As(III), while roots of the wild type extruded 50% of absorbed As(V). Additionally, by exposing the As-containing rice plants to an As-lacking solution for 24 h, about 30% of the total As derived from pre-treatment was extruded to the external solution by ScACR3-expressing plants, while about 15% of As was extruded by wild-type plants. Importantly, ScACR3 expression significantly reduced As accumulation in rice straws and grains. When grown in flooded soil irrigated with As(III)-containing water, the As concentration in husk and brown rice of the transgenic lines was reduced by 30 and 20%, respectively, compared with the wild type. This study reports a potential strategy to reduce As accumulation in the food chain by expressing heterologous genes in crops.
21951842	Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing EL1.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Homeobox transcription factors are involved in various aspects of plant development, including maintenance of the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of different hormones. However, few direct targets of homeobox proteins have been identified. We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling. HOX1a is induced by GA and encodes a homeobox transcription factor with transcription repression activity. In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling. These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling.

22076247	Adsorptive loss of secreted recombinant proteins in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Adsorptive loss of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin (hCTLA4Ig) in transgenic rice cell suspension cultures was investigated using glass flasks, plastic flasks, disposable vessels, and stainless steel vessels. When hCTLA4Ig was added to the glass flasks containing sterile AA medium, a rapid decrease in the concentration of hCTLA4Ig, independent on pH, was observed resulting in more than 90% of the protein loss within 1 h due to the surface adsorption. When the same experiments were performed on four different types of culture equipments mentioned above, the lowest adsorption level was observed in the plastic flasks and the highest level was observed in the glass flasks. The use of the plastic flasks retarded the adsorptive loss of hCTLA4Ig at the early stage of the protein production. There was a significant increase in the production of hCTLA4Ig when the flasks were coated with bovine serum albumin. However, the spike test of purified hCTLA4Ig at two different concentrations of 15 and 100 mg L(-1) in 500-mL spinner flasks confirmed that the amount of hCTLA4Ig adsorbed was dependent on the surface area of the flasks but not on the concentrations. In conclusion, although the protein adsorption affected the total amount of the protein yielded to some extent, it could be regarded as a minor factor in transgenic plant cell cultures with higher titer.
22055918	Transgenic rice accumulating modified cedar pollen allergen Cry j 2 derivatives.	2012	J Biosci Bioeng	In order to create a safe tolerogenic antigen with reduced IgE reactivity, we developed transgenic rice that accumulates in the seed endosperm a sufficient amount of Cry j 2, the cedar pollen allergen, in a restructured form of tail-to-head, providing a feasible mucosal allergy vaccine against cedar pollinosis.
22108719	Production of human growth hormone in transgenic rice seeds: co-introduction of RNA interference cassette for suppressing the gene expression of endogenous storage proteins.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Rice seeds are potentially useful hosts for the production of pharmaceutical proteins. However, low yields of recombinant proteins have been observed in many cases because recombinant proteins compete with endogenous storage proteins. Therefore, we attempt to suppress endogenous seed storage proteins by RNA interference (RNAi) to develop rice seeds as a more efficient protein expression system. In this study, human growth hormone (hGH) was expressed in transgenic rice seeds using an endosperm-specific promoter from a 10 kDa rice prolamin gene. In addition, an RNAi cassette for reduction of endogenous storage protein expressions was inserted into the hGH expression construct. Using this system, the expression levels of 13 kDa prolamin and glutelin were effectively suppressed and hGH polypeptides accumulated to 470 μg/g dry weight at the maximum level in transgenic rice seeds. These results suggest that the suppression of endogenous protein gene expression by RNAi could be of great utility for increasing transgene products.
22000797	Genome-wide identification of antioxidant component biosynthetic enzymes: comprehensive analysis of ascorbic acid and tocochromanols biosynthetic genes in rice.	2011	Comput Biol Chem	During the last two decades, several exciting reports have provided many advances in the role and biosynthesis of l-ascorbic acid (AsA) and tocochromanols, including tocopherols and tocotrienols, in higher plants. There are increasing bodies of experimental evidence that demonstrate that AsA and tocochromanols (especially tocopherols) play an important role as antioxidants and nutrients in mammals and photosynthetic organisms and are also involved in plant responses to stimuli. Although AsA and tocochromanol biosynthesis pathways have been well characterized using Arabidopsis, these pathways are still poorly understood in rice, which is an economically important monocot cereal crop. In this study using computational analysis of sequenced rice genome, we identified eight and seven potential non-redundant members involved in AsA and tocochromanol biosynthetic pathways, respectively. The results reveal that the common feature of these gene promoters is the combination of light-responsive, hormone-responsive, and stress-responsive elements. These findings, together with expression analysis in the MPSS database, indicate that AsA and tocochromanols might be co-related with the complex signaling pathways involved in plant responses.
21922808	[Nitrogen uptake rate and use efficiency by rice under different levels of the controlled-release N fertilizers (CRF) in the Nansi Lake basin].	2011	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The nitrogen (N) fertilizers overused or misused are the main contributors for water eutrophication of the Nansi Lake in eastern China. A field experiment with different application levels of controlled-release N fertilizer (CRF) was carried out at a rice field in the Nansi lake basin to provide information on the nitrogen uptake rate and use efficiency by rice with CRF application at different growth stages of rice. The fertilization levels for the controlled fertilizer in this study were 0, 300, 337.5 and 375 kg/hm2, respectively, and 375 kg/hm2 for conventional urea (CU). We estimated the N uptake rate in different growing season and apparent recovery of fertilizer in root, stover and grain of rice. The result showed that grain yield increased by higher N rate. However, the N uptake rate did not increase linearly with the nitrogen application amount. The highest N uptake rate was 22.48 mg/(plant x d) under the fertilization amount of 337.5 kg/hm2 during the young panicle differentiation stage. Apparent N recovery efficiency for CU with traditional application amount of 375 kg/hm2 was 21.86%. Apparent N recovery efficiency for CRF with application amount of 337.5 kg/hm2 was highest with 37.17%. Based on the statistical data, with CU of traditional urea application amount of 375 kg/hm2, nitrogen loss and soil N residue at one growing season are 130.07 x 10(3) t for Jining city and 11.4 x 10(3) t for Yutai county of the Nansi Lake basin. If using CRF with the optimized application amount of 337.5 kg/hm2, nitrogen loss and soil residual at one growing season is 10.46 x 10(4) t for Jining city. It could reduce losses of 2.55 x 10(4) t N for Jining city and 2 235.26 t N for Yutai county per year. Because of releasing patterns more closely matched to crop N uptake patterns, controlled release N fertilizer could be a good way to prevent water eutrophication due to nitrogen fertilizer overused or misused in the Nansi Lake.
21751161	Analysis of simple sequence repeat markers linked with blast disease resistance genes in a segregating population of rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	Genet Mol Res	Among 120 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, 23 polymorphic markers were used to identify the segregation ratio in 320 individuals of an F(2) rice population derived from Pongsu Seribu 2, a resistant variety, and Mahsuri, a susceptible rice cultivar. For phenotypic study, the most virulent blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) pathotype, P7.2, was used in screening of F(2) population in order to understand the inheritance of blast resistance as well as linkage with SSR markers. Only 11 markers showed a good fit to the expected segregation ratio (1:2:1) for the single gene model (d.f. = 1.0, P < 0.05) in chi-square (χ(2)) analyses. In the phenotypic data analysis, the F(2) population segregated in a 3:1 (R:S) ratio for resistant and susceptible plants, respectively. Therefore, resistance to blast pathotype P7.2 in Pongsu Seribu 2 is most likely controlled by a single nuclear gene. The plants from F(2) lines that showed resistance to blast pathotype P7.2 were linked to six alleles of SSR markers, RM168 (116 bp), RM8225 (221 bp), RM1233 (175 bp), RM6836 (240 bp), RM5961 (129 bp), and RM413 (79 bp). These diagnostic markers could be used in marker assisted selection programs to develop a durable blast resistant variety.
21791436	Impact of down-regulation of starch branching enzyme IIb in rice by artificial microRNA- and hairpin RNA-mediated RNA silencing.	2011	J Exp Bot	The inactivation of starch branching IIb (SBEIIb) in rice is traditionally associated with elevated apparent amylose content, increased peak gelatinization temperature, and a decreased proportion of short amylopectin branches. To elucidate further the structural and functional role of this enzyme, the phenotypic effects of down-regulating SBEIIb expression in rice endosperm were characterized by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) and hairpin RNA (hp-RNA) gene silencing. The results showed that RNA silencing of SBEIIb expression in rice grains did not affect the expression of other major isoforms of starch branching enzymes or starch synthases. Structural analyses of debranched starch showed that the doubling of apparent amylose content was not due to an increase in the relative proportion of amylose chains but instead was due to significantly elevated levels of long amylopectin and intermediate chains. Rices altered by the amiRNA technique produced a more extreme starch phenotype than those modified using the hp-RNA technique, with a greater increase in the proportion of long amylopectin and intermediate chains. The more pronounced starch structural modifications produced in the amiRNA lines led to more severe alterations in starch granule morphology and crystallinity as well as digestibility of freshly cooked grains. The potential role of attenuating SBEIIb expression in generating starch with elevated levels of resistant starch and lower glycaemic index is discussed.
21803813	High root temperature blocks both linear and cyclic electron transport in the dark during chilling of the leaves of rice seedlings.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The most photosynthetically active leaves of rice seedlings were severely damaged when shoots but not roots were chilled (10°C/25°C, respectively), but no such injury was observed when the whole seedling was chilled (10°C/10°C). To elucidate the mechanisms, we compared the photosynthetic characteristics of the seedlings during the dark chilling treatments. Simultaneous analyses of Chl fluorescence and the change in absorbance of P700 showed that electron transport almost disappeared in both PSII and PSI in the 10°C/25°C leaves, whereas the electron transport rate in PSI in the 10°C/10°C leaves was similar to or higher than that in non-chilled control leaves. Light-induced non-photochemical quenching in PSII was inhibited in the 10°C/25°C leaves, occurring at only half the level in the 10°C/10°C leaves, whereas non-light-induced non-photochemical quenching remained high in the 10°C/25°C leaves. The light induction of Chl a fluorescence (OJIP curves) in the 10°C/25°C leaves was similar to that in leaves treated with DCMU. The fluorescence decay after a single turnover saturating flash in the 10°C/25°C leaves was much slower than in the 10°C/10°C leaves. In vivo analyses of the 550-515 nm difference signal indicated decreased formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and decreased zeaxanthin formation in the 10°C/25°C leaves. Our results suggest that electron transport was blocked between Q(A) and Q(B) in the dark 10°C/25°C leaves, but without irreversible damage to the components of this system. The consequent light-dependent losses of electron transport, proton gradient formation across the thylakoids and thermal dissipation may therefore be responsible for the visible injury.
21726058	Mapping of quantitative trait loci for fiber and lignin contents from an interspecific cross Oryza sativa×Oryza rufipogon.	2011	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Rice straw is always regarded as a by-product of rice production, but it could be a significant energy source for ruminant animals. Knowledge of the genetic variation and genetic architecture of cell wall traits will facilitate rice breeders by improving relevant traits through selective breeding and genetic engineering. The common wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., which is considered to be the progenitor of Oryza sativa, has been widely utilized for the identification of genes of agronomic importance for rice genetic improvement. In the present study, the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), and ADL/NDF ratio was carried out in two environments using a backcrossed inbred line (BIL) population derived from a cross between the recurrent parent Xieqingzao B (XB) and an accession of Dongxiang wild rice (DWR). The results indicated that all four traits tested were continuously distributed among the BILs, but many BILs showed transgressive segregation. A total of 16 QTLs were identified for the four traits, but no QTLs were in common in two environments, suggesting that environment has dramatic effects on fiber and lignin syntheses. Compared to the QTL positions for grain yield-related traits, there were no unfavorable correlations between grain yield components and cell wall traits in this population. The QTLs identified in this study are useful for the development of dual-purpose rice varieties that are high in grain yield and are also high in straw quality.
21835275	Unadapted and adapted to starvation Acholeplasma laidlawii cells induce different responses of Oryza sativa, as determined by proteome analysis.	2011	J Proteomics	For the first time, we studied the phytopathogenicity toward Oryza sativa L. of unadapted and adapted to unfavorable environment (starvation) cells of Acholeplasma laidlawii PG8--ubiquitous mycoplasma found in the soil, waste waters, tissues of the highest eukaryotes and being the basic contaminant of cell cultures and a causative agent of phytomycoplasmoses. The features of morphology, ultrastructural organization and proteomes of unadapted and adapted cells of the mycoplasma and infected plants were presented. Using 2D-DIGE and MS, 43 proteins of O. sativa L. that were differentially expressed in the leaves of plants cultivated in media with A. laidlawii PG8 were identified. The qualitative and quantitative responses of the plant proteome toward adapted and unadapted mycoplasma cells differed. That may be explained by differences in the virulence of the corresponding bacterial cells. Using 2D-DIGE and MS, 82 proteins that were differentially expressed in adapted and unadapted mycoplasma cells were detected. In adapted cells of the mycoplasma, in comparison with unadapted ones, a significant increase in the expression of PNPase--a global regulator of virulence in phytopathogenic bacteria occurred; there was also decreased expression of 40 proteins including 14 involved in bacterial virulence and the expression of 31 proteins including 5 involved in virulence was not detected. We propose that differences in the phytopathogenicity of adapted and unadapted A. laidlawii PG8 cells may be related to features of their proteomes and membrane vesicles.
21850595	Transgenic rice plants harboring the grain hardness-locus region of Aegilops tauschii.	2011	Plant Cell Rep	Grain hardness of wheat is determined by the hardness (Ha)-locus region, which contains three friabilin-related genes: puroindoline-a (Pina), puroindoline-b (Pinb) and GSP-1. In our previous study, we produced the transgenic rice plants harboring the large genomic fragment of the Ha-locus region of Aegilops tauschii containing Pina and GSP-1 genes by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. To examine the effects of the transgenes in the rice endosperms, we firstly confirmed the homozygosity of the T-DNAs in four independent T2 lines by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and DNA gel blot analyses. The transgenes, Pina and GSP-1, were stably expressed in endosperms of the T3 and T4 seeds at RNA and protein levels, indicating that the promoters and other regulatory elements on the wheat Ha-locus region function in rice, and that multigene transformation using a large genomic fragment is a useful strategy. The functional contribution of the transgene-derived friabilins to the rice endosperm structure was considered as an increase of spaces between compound starch granules, resulting in a high proportion of white turbidity seeds.
21859960	A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth.	2012	Mol Plant	To better understand the response of rice to nutrient stress, we have taken a systematic approach to identify rice genes that respond to deficiency of macronutrients and affect rice growth. We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named NRR (nutrition response and root growth). NRR is alternatively spliced, producing two 5'-coterminal transcripts, NRRa and NRRb, encoding two proteins of 308 and 223 aa, respectively. Compared to NRRb, NRRa possesses an additional CCT domain at the C-terminus. Expression of NRR in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients. Knock-down of expression of NRRa or NRRb by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth. By contrast, overexpression of NRRa in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth. These results revealed that both NRRa and NRRb played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth. Our findings suggest that NRRa and NRRb, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients.
21807692	Root morphology, hydraulic conductivity and plant water relations of high-yielding rice grown under aerobic conditions.	2011	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasing physical water scarcity is a major constraint for irrigated rice (Oryza sativa) production. 'Aerobic rice culture' aims to maximize yield per unit water input by growing plants in aerobic soil without flooding or puddling. The objective was to determine (a) the effect of water management on root morphology and hydraulic conductance, and (b) their roles in plant-water relationships and stomatal conductance in aerobic culture.

METHODS: Root system development, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf water potential (Ψ(leaf)) were monitored in a high-yielding rice cultivar ('Takanari') under flooded and aerobic conditions at two soil moisture levels [nearly saturated (> -10 kPa) and mildly dry (> -30 kPa)] over 2 years. In an ancillary pot experiment, whole-plant hydraulic conductivity (soil-leaf hydraulic conductance; K(pa)) was measured under flooded and aerobic conditions.

KEY RESULTS: Adventitious root emergence and lateral root proliferation were restricted even under nearly saturated conditions, resulting in a 72-85 % reduction in total root length under aerobic culture conditions. Because of their reduced rooting size, plants grown under aerobic conditions tended to have lower K(pa) than plants grown under flooded conditions. Ψ(leaf) was always significantly lower in aerobic culture than in flooded culture, while g(s) was unchanged when the soil moisture was at around field capacity. g(s) was inevitably reduced when the soil water potential at 20-cm depth reached -20 kPa.

CONCLUSIONS: Unstable performance of rice in water-saving cultivations is often associated with reduction in Ψ(leaf). Ψ(leaf) may reduce even if K(pa) is not significantly changed, but the lower Ψ(leaf) would certainly occur in case K(pa) reduces as a result of lower water-uptake capacity under aerobic conditions. Rice performance in aerobic culture might be improved through genetic manipulation that promotes lateral root branching and rhizogenesis as well as deep rooting.
21883233	Pre-attachment Striga hermonthica resistance of New Rice for Africa (NERICA) cultivars based on low strigolactone production.	2011	New Phytol	Striga hermonthica (Striga) is an obligate hemiparasitic weed, causing severe yield losses in cereals, including rice, throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Striga germination depends on strigolactones (germination stimulants) exuded by the host roots. The interspecific New Rice for Africa (NERICA) cultivars offer a potentially interesting gene pool for a screen for low germination-inducing rice cultivars. Exudates were collected from all NERICA cultivars and their parents (Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima) for the analysis of strigolactones. In vitro and in situ Striga germination, attachment and emergence rates were recorded for each cultivar. NERICA 1 and CG14 produced significantly less strigolactones and showed less Striga infection than the other cultivars. NERICAs 7, 8, 11 and 14 produced the largest amounts of strigolactones and showed the most severe Striga infection. Across all the cultivars and parents, there was a positive relationship between the amount of strigolactones in the exudate and Striga germination, attachment and emergence rates. This study shows that there is genetic variation in Striga pre-attachment resistance in NERICA rice. Cultivars combining this pre-attachment resistance with post-attachment resistance (already identified) can provide a key component for durable integrated management of this noxious weed in cereal production systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
21894467	Identification of qSOR1, a major rice QTL involved in soil-surface rooting in paddy fields.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Specific Indonesian lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars elongate thick primary roots on the soil surface of paddy fields. To clarify the genetic factors controlling soil-surface rooting, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using 124 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Gemdjah Beton, an Indonesian lowland rice cultivar with soil-surface roots, and Sasanishiki, a Japanese lowland rice cultivar without soil-surface roots. These cultivars and the RILs were tested for soil-surface rooting in a paddy field. We identified four regions of chromosomes 3, 4, 6, and 7 that were associated with soil-surface rooting in the field. Among them, one major QTL was located on the long arm of chromosome 7. This QTL explained 32.5-53.6% of the total phenotypic variance across three field evaluations. To perform fine mapping of this QTL, we measured the basal root growth angle of crown roots at the seedling stage in seven BC(2)F(3) recombinant lines grown in small cups in a greenhouse. The QTL was mapped between markers RM21941 and RM21976, which delimit an 812-kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. We have designated this QTL qSOR1 (quantitative trait locus for SOIL SURFACE ROOTING 1).
21848845	A de novo synthesis citrate transporter, Vigna umbellata multidrug and toxic compound extrusion, implicates in Al-activated citrate efflux in rice bean (Vigna umbellata) root apex.	2011	Plant Cell Environ	Al-activated organic acid anion efflux from roots is an important Al resistance mechanism in plants. We have conducted homologous cloning and isolated Vigna umbellata multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (VuMATE), a gene encoding a de novo citrate transporter from rice bean. Al treatment up-regulated VuMATE expression in the root apex, but neither in the mature root region nor in the leaf. The degree of up-regulation of VuMATE was both partially Al concentration and time dependent, consistent with the delay in the onset of the Al-induced citrate efflux in rice bean roots. While La(3+) moderately induced VuMATE expression, Cd(2+) and Cu(2+) did not induce the expression. Electrophysiological analysis of Xenopus oocytes expressing VuMATE indicated this transporter can mediate significant anion efflux across the plasma membrane. [(14) C]citrate efflux experiments in oocytes demonstrated that VuMATE is a H(+) -dependent citrate transporter. In addition, expression of VuMATE in transgenic tomato resulted in increased Al resistance, which correlated with an enhanced citrate efflux. Taken together, these findings suggest that VuMATE is a functional homolog of the known citrate transporters in sorghum, barley, maize and Arabidopsis. The similarities and differences of all the known citrate transporters associated with Al stress in the MATE family are also discussed.
22028913	Five proteins of Laodelphax striatellus are potentially involved in the interactions between rice stripe virus and vector.	2011	PLoS One	Rice stripe virus (RSV) is the type member of the genus Tenuivirus, which relies on the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén) for its transmission in a persistent, circulative-propagative manner. To be transmitted, virus must cross the midgut and salivary glands epithelial barriers in a transcytosis mechanism where vector receptors interact with virions, and as propagative virus, RSV need utilize host components to complete viral propagation in vector cells. At present, these mechanisms remain unknown. In this paper, we screened L. striatellus proteins, separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), as potential RSV binding molecules using a virus overlay assay of protein blots. The results, five L. striatellus proteins that bound to purified RSV particles in vitro were resolved and identified using mass spectrometry. The virus-binding capacities of five proteins were further elucidated in yeast two-hybrid screen (YTHS) and virus-binding experiments of expressed proteins. Among five proteins, the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH3) did not interact with RSV nucleocapsid protein (NCP) in YTHS and in far-Western blot, and three ribosomal proteins (RPL5, RPL7a and RPL8) had specific interactions with RSV. In dot immunobinding assay (DIBA), all five proteins were able to bind to RSV particles. The five proteins' potential contributions to the interactions between RSV and L. striatellus were discussed. We proposed that RACK and GAPDH3 might be involved in the epithelial transcytosis of virus particles, and three ribosomal proteins probably played potential crucial roles in the infection and propagation of RSV in vector cells.
22072914	Molecular identification of Fusarium species in Gibberella fujikuroi species complex from rice, sugarcane and maize from Peninsular Malaysia.	2011	Int J Mol Sci	The objective of this study was to identify Fusarium species in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex from rice, sugarcane and maize as most of the Fusarium species in the species complex are found on the three crops. Isolates used were collected from the field and obtained from culture collection. The Fusarium isolates were initially sorted based on morphology and identifications confirmed based on the DNA sequence of the translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF-1α) gene. Based on the closest match of BLAST analysis, five species were recovered, namely, F. sacchari, F. fujikuroi, F. proliferatum, F. andiyazi and F. verticillioides. This is the first report regarding F. andiyazi from rice in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. The phylogenetic tree generated by using the neighbor joining method showed that isolates from the same species were grouped in the same clade. The present study indicated that Fusarium species in the G. fujikuroi species complex are widespread in rice, sugarcane and maize in Peninsular Malaysia. The findings also suggest that the use of morphological characters for identification of Fusarium species in the G. fujikuroi species complex from the three crops will lead to incorrect species designation.
22153234	Phytochromes A and C cooperatively regulate early and transient gene expression after red-light irradiation in rice seedlings.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Phytochromes are red/far-red photoreceptors encoded by a small gene family in higher plants. Differences in phenotype among mutants suggest distinct functions among phytochrome subfamilies. We attempted to find distinct functions among phytochromes by oligo-microarray analysis of single, double, and triple mutants in rice. In most cases, gene expression was redundantly regulated by phytochromes A and B after irradiation by a red light pulse in etiolated rice shoots. However, we found that several genes were specifically regulated by phytochromes A and C. Most of them were expressed immediately after the red light pulse in a transient manner. They are stress-related genes that may be involved in resistance to light stress when etiolated seedlings are exposed to light. These genes were not expressed in green leaves after the red light pulse, suggesting that they have a function specific to etiolated seedlings.
22021420	Porphyrin biosynthesis control under water stress: sustained porphyrin status correlates with drought tolerance in transgenic rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	A controlled flow of porphyrin metabolites is critical for organisms, but little is known about the control of porphyrin biosynthesis under environmental stress. We monitored transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants expressing Myxococcus xanthus protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) for their response to drought stress. Transgenic plants showed significantly improved drought tolerance, as indicated by a higher shoot water potential, less oxidative damage, and a more favorable redox balance compared with wild-type plants. Both transgenic and wild-type plants responded to the onset of drought stress, even prior to changes in shoot water potential and oxidative metabolism, by drastically scavenging porphyrin intermediates in leaves, which was crucial for alleviating reactive oxygen species-induced stress. Protoporphyrin IX, protochlorophyllide, magnesium-protoporphyrin IX, and its methyl ester were absent or hardly detected with the intensification of water stress (-3.1 MPa) in the wild type, whereas transgenic plants retained these intermediates to some extent. Additionally, the expression and activity of most enzymes involved in porphyrin biosynthesis, particularly in the chlorophyll branch, were primarily down-regulated under dehydrating conditions, with stronger repression in the wild type than in transgenic plants. There was up-regulation of Glutamate 1-Semialdehyde Aminotransferase, PPO1, and Fe Chelatase2 transcripts in drought-stressed transgenic plants, enabling the transgenic plants to make larger pools of 5-aminolevulinic acid and protoporphyrin IX available for subsequent steps in the heme branch. Overexpression of PPO ultimately protected the transgenic plants from drought-induced cytotoxicity, demonstrating clearly that manipulation of porphyrin biosynthesis can produce drought-tolerant plants. Our results support a possible role for tetrapyrroles in signaling their metabolic state and in plant protection under drought stress conditions.
21985968	Parsing a multifunctional biosynthetic gene cluster from rice: Biochemical characterization of CYP71Z6 &amp; 7.	2011	FEBS Lett	Rice (Oryza sativa) contains a biosynthetic gene cluster associated with production of at least two groups of diterpenoid phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides. While cytochromes P450 (CYP) from this cluster are known to be involved in phytocassane production, such mono-oxygenase activity relevant to oryzalide biosynthesis was unknown. Here we report biochemical characterization demonstrating that CYP71Z6 from this cluster acts as an ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase that is presumably involved in the biosynthesis of oryzalides. Our results further suggest that the closely related and co-clustered CYP71Z7 likely acts as a C2-hydroxylase involved in a latter step of phytocassane biosynthesis. Thus, CYP71Z6 & 7 appear to have evolved distinct roles in rice diterpenoid metabolism, offering insight into plant biosynthetic gene cluster evolution.
21980143	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice.	2012	Mol Plant	Leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by chlorophyll degradation, is important to plant growth and crop productivity. It emerges that autophagy is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence. However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the process is not well understood. In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified. The rls1 mutant developed small, yellow-brown lesions resembling disease scattered over the whole surfaces of leaves that displayed earlier senescence than those of wild-type plants. The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in rls1. Microscopic observation indicated that PCD was misregulated, probably resulting in the accelerated degradation of chloroplasts in rls1 leaves. Map-based cloning of the RLS1 gene revealed that it encodes a previously uncharacterized NB (nucleotide-binding site)-containing protein with an ARM (armadillo) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin. Intriguingly, constitutive expression of RLS1 also slightly accelerated leaf senescence with decreased chlorophyll content in transgenic rice plants. Our study identified a previously uncharacterized NB-ARM protein involved in PCD during plant growth and development, providing a unique tool for dissecting possible autophagy-mediated PCD during senescence in plants.
21912213	Effect of the interaction between light and touch stimuli on inducing curling seminal roots in rice seedlings.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Root development is sensitive to environmental stimuli. We have recently reported that the light signal could promote the helical growth of seminal roots and drive the wavy root morphology in rice (Oryza sativa L.) young seedlings. The light-stimulated wavy roots were mostly performed in indica-type rice varieties (e.g. Taichung Native 1; TCN1) but not in japonica rice (e.g. Tainung 67; TNG67). Here, we demonstrated that the light-driven circumutation trajectory of TCN1 seminal roots could be changed if the seedling roots were grown in the medium containing high concentration of Phytagel. The data showed the root morphology would be modulated from wavy to curling when the Phytagel concentration was increased to 2%. However, the touch-stimulated curling root phenotype could not be performed in dark. In addition, the touch-induced curling roots were not appeared in the TNG67 rice cultivar. Although touch stimuli could not induce wavy/curling root phenotype in dark, it could modify the light-promoted helical growth to conduct curling roots in TCN1 rice seedlings. Thus, it was suggested that there is a crosstalk mechanism between touching-induced root curling and light-stimulated root waving.
22071266	A rice orthologue of the ABA receptor, OsPYL/RCAR5, is a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway in seed germination and early seedling growth.	2012	J Exp Bot	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that positively regulates seed dormancy and stress tolerance. PYL/RCARs were identified an intracellular ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their function in monocot species has not been characterized yet. Herein, it is demonstrated that PYL/RCAR orthologues in Oryza sativa function as a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsPYL/RCAR5, a PYL/RCAR orthologue of rice, were found to be hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth. A rice ABA signalling unit composed of OsPYL/RCAR5, OsPP2C30, SAPK2, and OREB1 for ABA-dependent gene regulation was further identified, via interaction assays and a transient gene expression assay. Thus, a core signalling unit for ABA-responsive gene expression modulating seed germination and early seedling growth in rice has been unravelled. This study provides substantial contributions toward understanding the ABA signal transduction pathway in rice.
22113535	Long-term effects of nutraceuticals (berberine, red yeast rice, policosanol) in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients.	2011	Adv Ther	INTRODUCTION: Statins are at the forefront of strategies to manage dyslipidemia, although they are not always well tolerated. At 6-7 months after the drug was supplied, discontinuation rates averaged 30%. Alternate agents to statins have been studied. Some nutraceuticals demonstrated an efficacy in reducing cholesterol concentrations. However, there are no data regarding the use of nutraceuticals in elderly dyslipidemic patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a nutraceutical-based protocol in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients previously intolerant to statins.

METHODS: This study was performed as a randomized, prospective, parallel group, single-blind study. Patients were included in the study if they had high total cholesterolemia, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), >75 years of age, statin-intolerant, and were refusing other pharmaceutical treatments for hypercholesterolemia. At the baseline visit, eligible patients were randomized to either nutraceutical-combined pill (containing berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2.0 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg) or placebo, and the first dose was dispensed. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the proposed treatment were fully assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment.

RESULTS: Out of 106 consecutive patients screened, 80 eligible patients were randomized to receive either nutraceutical-combined pill (40 patients) or placebo (40 patients). No patients were lost and no deaths occurred during the follow-up. There was a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterolemia (-20%), LDL-C (-31%), and insulin resistance (-10%) with nutraceutical treatment. No significant changes were detected for plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, no statistical differences were found between baseline and end-study safety parameters. Medication compliance and tolerability were high.

CONCLUSION: In this study the authors have demonstrated that combined nutraceuticals significantly reduce cholesterolemia and achieved acceptable plasma LDL-C levels in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients who were previously statin-intolerant. Combined nutraceuticals is also safe and well tolerated in these patients.
22132208	Transcriptional downregulation of rice rpL32 gene under abiotic stress is associated with removal of transcription factors within the promoter region.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The regulation of ribosomal proteins in plants under stress conditions has not been well studied. Although a few reports have shown stress-specific post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms involved in downregulation of ribosomal proteins yet stress-responsive transcriptional regulation of ribosomal proteins is largely unknown in plants.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present work, transcriptional regulation of genes encoding rice 60S ribosomal protein L32 (rpL32) in response to salt stress has been studied. Northern and RT-PCR analyses showed a significant downregulation of rpL32 transcripts under abiotic stress conditions in rice. Of the four rpL32 genes in rice genome, the gene on chromosome 8 (rpL32_8.1) showed a higher degree of stress-responsive downregulation in salt sensitive rice variety than in tolerant one and its expression reverted to its original level upon withdrawal of stress. The nuclear run-on and promoter:reporter assays revealed that the downregulation of this gene is transcriptional and originates within the promoter region. Using in vivo footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), cis-elements in the promoter of rpL32_8.1 showing reduced binding to proteins in shoots of salt stressed rice seedlings were identified.

CONCLUSIONS: The present work is one of the few reports on study of stress downregulated genes. The data revealed that rpL32 gene is transcriptionally downregulated under abiotic stress in rice and that this transcriptional downregulation is associated with the removal of transcription factors from specific promoter elements.
22044963	Expression of a bacterial chitosanase in rice plants improves disease resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Plant fungal pathogens change their cell wall components during the infection process to avoid degradation by host lytic enzymes, and conversion of the cell wall chitin to chitosan is likely to be one infection strategy of pathogens. Thus, introduction of chitosan-degradation activity into plants is expected to improve fungal disease resistance. Chitosanase has been found in bacteria and fungi, but not in higher plants. Here, we demonstrate that chitosanase, Cho1, from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 has antifungal activity against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Introduction of the cho1 gene conferred chitosanase activity to rice cells. Transgenic rice plants expressing Cho1 designed to be localized in the apoplast showed increased resistance to M. oryzae accompanied by increased generation of hydrogen peroxide in the infected epidermal cells. These results strongly suggest that chitosan exists in the enzyme-accessible surface of M. oryzae during the infection process and that the enhancement of disease resistance is attributable to the antifungal activity of the secreted Cho1 and to increased elicitation of the host defense response.
22134721	Suppression of NS3 and MP is important for the stable inheritance of RNAi-mediated rice stripe virus (RSV) resistance obtained by targeting the fully complementary RSV-CP gene.	2012	Mol Cells	Rice stripe virus (RSV) is a viral disease that seriously impacts rice production in East Asia, most notably in Korea, China, and Japan. Highly RSV-resistant transgenic japonica rice plants were generated using a dsRNAi construct designed to silence the entire sequence region of the RSV-CP gene. Transgenic rice plants were inoculated with a population of viruliferous insects, small brown planthoppers (SBPH), and their resistance was evaluated using ELISA and an infection rate assay. A correlation between the expression of the RSV-CP homologous small RNAs and the RSV resistance of the transgenic rice lines was discovered. These plants were also analyzed by comparing the expression pattern of invading viral genes, small RNA production and the stable transmission of the RSV resistance trait to the T3 generation. Furthermore, the agronomic trait was stably transmitted to the T4 generation of transgenic plants.
22067109	Role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is toxic to humans, and its accumulation in rice grains is a major agricultural problem. Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only OsNRAMP1 is highly up-regulated by iron (Fe) deficiency. OsNRAMP1 localized to the plasma membrane and transported Cd as well as Fe. OsNRAMP1 expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki). The amino acid sequence of OsNRAMP1 in the Sasanishiki and Habataki cultivars was found to be 100% identical. These results suggest that OsNRAMP1 participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in OsNRAMP1 expression levels in roots.
22173308	Field evaluation of effects of transgenic cry1Ab/cry1Ac, cry1C and cry2A rice on Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and its arthropod predators.	2011	Sci China Life Sci	The impacts of transgenic Bt rice on target pests and their predators need to be clarified prior to the commercialization of Bt rice. In this study, the percentages of folded leaves of three transgenic Bt rice lines and non-transgenic parental rice line caused by Cnaphalocrocis medinalis were studied over two successive growing seasons. In addition, the population densities, relative abundance and population dynamics of C. medinalis and four species of its natural arthropod predators were investigated at three sites in China. The results showed that rice line significantly affected the percentages of folded leaves and population densities of C. medinalis larvae. Significantly higher percentages of folded leaves were observed on the non-transgenic rice compared with the three transgenic Bt rice on most sampling dates. Significantly higher densities of C. medinalis larvae and higher relative abundance of C. medinalis within phytophages were found on non-transgenic rice compared with three transgenic Bt rice at different sites across the study period. The population dynamics of C. medinalis larvae were significantly affected by rice line, rice line×sampling date, rice line×year, rice line×sampling date×year. However, there was little, if any, significant difference in the relative abundance, population density and population dynamics of the four arthropod predators between the three Bt rice lines and non-transgenic rice. The results of this study indicate that the Bt toxin in transgenic Bt rice can effectively suppress the occurrence of C. medinalis, but has no significant effects on the occurrence of the four predatory arthropod species.
22124893	C2 domain is responsible for targeting rice phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in Ca²⁺ mediated signalling events that lead to altered cellular status. Using various sequence-analysis methods, we identified two conserved motifs in known PLC sequences. The identified motifs are located in the C2 domain of plant PLCs and are not found in any other protein. These motifs are specifically found in the Ca²⁺ binding loops and form adjoining beta strands. Further, we identified certain conserved residues that are highly distinct from corresponding residues of animal PLCs. The motifs reported here could be used to annotate plant-specific phospholipase C sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the C2 domain alone is capable of targeting PLC to the membrane in response to a Ca²⁺ signal. We also showed that the binding event results from a change in the hydrophobicity of the C2 domain upon Ca²⁺ binding. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that all PLCs from Arabidopsis and rice lack a transmembrane domain, myristoylation and GPI-anchor protein modifications. Our bioinformatic study indicates that plant PLCs are located in the cytoplasm, the nucleus and the mitochondria. Our results suggest that there are no distinct isoforms of plant PLCs, as have been proposed to exist in the soluble and membrane associated fractions. The same isoform could potentially be present in both subcellular fractions, depending on the calcium level of the cytosol. Overall, these data suggest that the C2 domain of PLC plays a vital role in calcium signalling.
22081040	Comparative sequence analysis of VRN1 alleles of Lolium perenne with the co-linear regions in barley, wheat, and rice.	2011	Mol Genet Genomics	Vernalization, a period of low temperature to induce transition from vegetative to reproductive state, is an important environmental stimulus for many cool season grasses. A key gene in the vernalization pathway in grasses is the VRN1 gene. The objective of this study was to identify causative polymorphism(s) at the VRN1 locus in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) for variation in vernalization requirement. Two allelic Bacterial Artificial Chromosome clones of the VRN1 locus from the two genotypes Veyo and Falster with contrasting vernalization requirements were identified, sequenced, and characterized. Analysis of the allelic sequences identified an 8.6-kb deletion in the first intron of the VRN1 gene in the Veyo genotype which has low vernalization requirement. This deletion was in a divergent recurrent selection experiment confirmed to be associated with genotypes with low vernalization requirement. The region surrounding the VRN1 locus in perennial ryegrass showed microcolinearity to the corresponding region on chromosome 3 in Oryza sativa with conserved gene order and orientation, while the micro-colinearity to the corresponding region in Triticum monococcum was less conserved. Our study indicates that the first intron of the VRN1 gene, and in particular the identified 8.6 kb region, is an important regulatory region for vernalization response in perennial ryegrass.
22008150	qDTY₁.₁, a major QTL for rice grain yield under reproductive-stage drought stress with a consistent effect in multiple elite genetic backgrounds.	2011	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses causing drastic reductions in yield in rainfed rice environments. The suitability of grain yield (GY) under drought as a selection criterion has been reported in the past few years. Most of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for GY under drought in rice reported so far has been in the background of low-yielding susceptible varieties. Such QTLs have not shown a similar effect in multiple high- yielding drought-susceptible varieties, thus limiting their use in marker-assisted selection. Genetic control of GY under reproductive-stage drought stress (RS) in elite genetic backgrounds was studied in three F3:4 mapping populations derived from crosses of N22, a drought-tolerant aus cultivar, with Swarna, IR64, and MTU1010, three high-yielding popular mega-varieties, with the aim to identify QTLs for GY under RS that show a consistent effect in multiple elite genetic backgrounds. Three populations were phenotyped under RS in the dry seasons (DS) of 2009 and 2010 at IRRI. For genotyping, whole-genome scans for N22/MTU1010 and bulked segregant analysis for N22/Swarna and N22/IR64 were employed using SSR markers.

RESULTS: A major QTL for GY under RS, qDTY₁.₁, was identified on rice chromosome 1 flanked by RM11943 and RM431 in all three populations. In combined analysis over two years, qDTY₁.₁ showed an additive effect of 29.3%, 24.3%, and 16.1% of mean yield in N22/Swarna, N22/IR64, and N22/MTU1010, respectively, under RS. qDTY₁.₁ also showed a positive effect on GY in non-stress (NS) situations in N22/Swarna, N22/IR64 over both years, and N22/MTU1010 in DS2009.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported QTL in rice with a major and consistent effect in multiple elite genetic backgrounds under both RS and NS situations. Consistency of the QTL effect across different genetic backgrounds makes it a suitable candidate for use in marker-assisted breeding.
22174442	pH regulation in anoxic rice coleoptiles at pH 3.5: biochemical pHstats and net H+ influx in the absence and presence of NOFormula.	2012	J Exp Bot	During anoxia, cytoplasmic pH regulation is crucial. Mechanisms of pH regulation were studied in the coleoptile of rice exposed to anoxia and pH 3.5, resulting in H(+) influx. Germinating rice seedlings survived a combination of anoxia and exposure to pH 3.5 for at least 4 d, although development was retarded and net K(+) efflux was continuous. Further experiments used excised coleoptile tips (7-10 mm) in anoxia at pH 6.5 or 3.5, either without or with 0.2 mM NO(3)(-), which distinguished two processes involved in pH regulation. Net H(+) influx (μmol g(-1) fresh weight h(-1)) for coleoptiles with NO(3)(-) was ∼1.55 over the first 24 h, being about twice that in the absence of NO(3)(-), but then decreased to 0.5-0.9 as net NO(3)(-) uptake declined from ∼1.3 to 0.5, indicating reduced uptake via H(+)-NO(3)(-) symports. NO(3)(-) reduction presumably functioned as a biochemical pHstat. A second biochemical pHstat consisted of malate and succinate, and their concentrations decreased substantially with time after exposure to pH 3.5. In anoxic coleoptiles, K(+) balancing the organic anions was effluxed to the medium as organic anions declined, and this efflux rate was independent of NO(3)(-) supply. Thus, biochemical pHstats and reduced net H(+) influx across the plasma membrane are important features contributing to pH regulation in anoxia-tolerant rice coleoptiles at pH 3.5.
22138855	Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	We report that phytochrome B (phyB) mutants exhibit improved drought tolerance compared to wild type (WT) rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). To understand the underlying mechanism by which phyB regulates drought tolerance, we analyzed root growth and water loss from the leaves of phyB mutants. The root system showed no significant difference between the phyB mutants and WT, suggesting that improved drought tolerance has little relation to root growth. However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants. In addition, the developed leaves of phyB mutants displayed larger epidermal cells than WT leaves, resulting in reduced stomatal density. phyB deficiency promoted the expression of both putative ERECTA family genes and EXPANSIN family genes involved in cell expansion in leaves, thus causing greater epidermal cell expansion in the phyB mutants. Reduced stomatal density resulted in reduced transpiration per unit leaf area in the phyB mutants. Considering all these findings, we propose that phyB deficiency causes both reduced total leaf area and reduced transpiration per unit leaf area, which explains the reduced water loss and improved drought tolerance of phyB mutants.
22145600	High-amylose rice improves indices of animal health in normal and diabetic rats.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	A high-amylose rice with 64.8% amylose content (AC) was developed by transgenic inhibition of two isoforms of starch branching enzyme (SBE), SBEI and SBEIIb, in an indica rice cultivar. The expression of SBEI and SBEIIb was completely inhibited in the transgenic line, whereas the expression of granule-bound starch synthase was normal. Compared with wild-type rice, drastic reductions in both SBEs in the transgenic rice increased apparent AC in flour from 27.2% to 64.8%, resistant starch (RS) content from 0% to 14.6% and total dietary fibre (TDF) from 6.8% to 15.2%. Elevated AC increased the proportion of long unit chains in amylopectin and increased onset gelatinization temperature and resistance to alkaline digestion; however, kernel weight was decreased. A rat feeding trial indicated that consumption of high-amylose rice decreased body weight gain significantly (P < 0.01); increased faecal mass, faecal moisture and short-chain fatty acids; and lowered the faecal pH. An acute oral rice tolerance test revealed that the high-amylose rice had a positive effect on lowering the blood glucose response in diabetic Zucker fatty rats. This novel rice with its high AC, RS and TDF offers potential benefits for its use in foods and in industrial applications.
22209166	Comparative proteomic study reveals dynamic proteome changes between superhybrid rice LYP9 and its parents at different developmental stages.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Heterosis is a common phenomenon in which the hybrids exhibit superior agronomic performance than either inbred parental lines. Although hybrid rice is one of the most successful apotheoses in crops utilizing heterosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying rice heterosis remain elusive. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rice heterosis, comparative leaf proteomic analysis between a superhybrid rice LYP9 and its parental cultivars 9311 and PA64s at tillering, flowering and grain-filling stages were carried out. A total of 384 differentially expressed proteins (DP) were detected and 297 DP were identified, corresponding to 222 unique proteins. As DP were divided into those between the parents (DP(PP)) and between the hybrid and its parents (DP(HP)), the comparative results demonstrate that proteins in the categories of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and disease/defense were mainly enriched in DP. Moreover, the number of identified DP(HP) involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, and disease/defense increased at flowering and grain-filling stages as compared to that at the tillering stage. Most of the up-regulated DP(HP) involved in the three categories showed greater expression in LYP9 at flowering and grain-filling stages than at the tillering stage. In addition, CO(2) assimilation rate and apparent quantum yield of photosynthesis also showed a greater increase in LYP9 at flowering and grain-filling stages than at the tillering stage. These results suggest that the proteins involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, and disease/defense as well as their dynamic regulation at different developmental stages may be responsible for heterosis in rice.
22132759	Isolation and structure elucidation of two new cytotoxic metabolites from red yeast rice.	2012	Nat Prod Res	In this study, 10 already described secondary metabolites and 2 unknown metabolites were identified in an extract of Monascus purpureus by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. The unknown metabolites were isolated and their chemical structures were elucidated. The new metabolites possess the molecular formulas C(21)H(27)NO(4) and C(23)H(31)NO(4). They were named monascopyridines E and F due to their pyridine backbone. The cytotoxicity of the new compounds was studied using immortalised human kidney epithelial cells displaying IC(50) values in the micromolar range.
22200664	Ascorbic acid and reactive oxygen species are involved in the inhibition of seed germination by abscisic acid in rice seeds.	2012	J Exp Bot	The antagonism between abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) plays a key role in controlling seed germination, but the mechanism of antagonism during this process is not known. The possible links among ABA, reactive oxygen species (ROS), ascorbic acid (ASC), and GA during rice seed germination were investigated. Unlike in non-seed tissues where ROS production is increased by ABA, ABA reduced ROS production in imbibed rice seeds, especially in the embryo region. Such reduced ROS also led to an inhibition of ASC production. GA accumulation was also suppressed by a reduced ROS and ASC level, which was indicated by the inhibited expression of GA biosynthesis genes, amylase genes, and enzyme activity. Application of exogenous ASC can partially rescue seed germination from ABA treatment. Production of ASC, which acts as a substrate in GA biosynthesis, was significantly inhibited by lycorine which thus suppressed the accumulation of GA. Consequently, expression of GA biosynthesis genes was suppressed by the low levels of ROS and ASC in ABA-treated seeds. It can be concluded that ABA regulates seed germination in multiple dimensions. ROS and ASC are involved in its inhibition of GA biosynthesis.
22196402	Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with salt tolerance at seedling stage from Oryza rufipogon.	2011	J Genet Genomics	Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant growth and crop production. In the present study, salt tolerance at rice seedling stage was evaluated using 87 introgression lines (ILs), which were derived from a cross between an elite indica cultivar Teqing and an accession of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.). Substantial variation was observed for four traits including salt tolerance score (STS), relative root dry weight (RRW), relative shoot dry weight (RSW) and relative total dry weight (RTW). STS was significantly positively correlated with all other three traits. A total of 15 putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with these four traits were detected using single-point analysis, which were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 and 10 with 8%-26% explaining the phenotypic variance. The O. rufipogon-derived alleles at 13 QTLs (86.7%) could improve the salt tolerance in the Teqing background. Four QTL clusters affecting RRW, RSW and RTW were found on chromosomes 6, 7, 9 and 10, respectively. Among these four QTL clusters, a major cluster including three QTLs (qRRW10, qRSW10 and qRTW10) was found near the maker RM271 on the long arm of chromosome 10, and the O. rufipogon-derived alleles at these three loci increased RRW, RSW and RTW with additive effects of 22.7%, 17.3% and 18.5%, respectively, while the phenotypic variance explained by these three individual QTLs for the three traits varied from 19% to 26%. In addition, several salt tolerant ILs were selected and could be used for identifying and utilizing favorable salt tolerant genes from common wild rice and used in the salt tolerant rice breeding program.
22203474	TH1, a DUF640 domain-like gene controls lemma and palea development in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	The developmental regulation of grasses lemma and palea and their relationship to the floral organs in dicots had been variously explicated and extensively debated. Here, we characterized a triangular hull mutant th1-1 from EMS-mutagenized Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11. The th1-1 mutant exhibited obviously triangular hull with tortuous and slender lemma/palea. Using a map-based cloning strategy, the TH1 gene was narrowed down to a 60-kb region on the long arm of chromosome 2. Sequence verification revealed that the th1-1 mutant harbored 1-bp deletion in exon 2 of LOC_Os02g56610 which resulted in a frame-shift mutation. The RNA-interference transgenic plants of LOC_Os02g56610 displayed a similar phenotype to the th1 mutant. Consequently, LOC_Os02g56610 was identified as the TH1 gene which encoded 248 amino acids and contained a DUF640 domain. RT-PCR analysis and GUS staining showed that the transcripts of TH1 mainly accumulated in young inflorescence, lemma and palea of spikelet. These results suggested that TH1 was an important gene controlling the lemma and palea development in rice.
22164211	Population structure and genetic diversity in a rice core collection (Oryza sativa L.) investigated with SSR markers.	2011	PLoS One	The assessment of genetic diversity and population structure of a core collection would benefit to make use of these germplasm as well as applying them in association mapping. The objective of this study were to (1) examine the population structure of a rice core collection; (2) investigate the genetic diversity within and among subgroups of the rice core collection; (3) identify the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the rice core collection. A rice core collection consisting of 150 varieties which was established from 2260 varieties of Ting's collection of rice germplasm were genotyped with 274 SSR markers and used in this study. Two distinct subgroups (i.e. SG 1 and SG 2) were detected within the entire population by different statistical methods, which is in accordance with the differentiation of indica and japonica rice. MCLUST analysis might be an alternative method to STRUCTURE for population structure analysis. A percentage of 26% of the total markers could detect the population structure as the whole SSR marker set did with similar precision. Gene diversity and MRD between the two subspecies varied considerably across the genome, which might be used to identify candidate genes for the traits under domestication and artificial selection of indica and japonica rice. The percentage of SSR loci pairs in significant (P<0.05) LD is 46.8% in the entire population and the ratio of linked to unlinked loci pairs in LD is 1.06. Across the entire population as well as the subgroups and sub-subgroups, LD decays with genetic distance, indicating that linkage is one main cause of LD. The results of this study would provide valuable information for association mapping using the rice core collection in future.
22188265	Comparing systemic defence-related gene expression changes upon migratory and sedentary nematode attack in rice.	2012	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Complex defence signalling pathways, controlled by different hormones, are known to be involved in the reaction of plants to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stress factors. Here, we studied the differential expression of genes involved in stress and defence responses in systemic tissue of rice infected with the root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne graminicola and the migratory root rot nematode Hirschmanniella oryzae, two agronomically important rice pathogens with very different lifestyles. qRT-PCR revealed that all investigated systemic tissues had significantly lower expression of isochorismate synthase, a key enzyme for salicylic acid production involved in basal defence and systemic acquired resistance. The systemic defence response upon migratory nematode infection was remarkably similar to fungal rice blast infection. Almost all investigated defence-related genes were up-regulated in rice shoots 3 days after root rot nematode attack, including the phenylpropanoid pathway, ethylene pathway and PR genes, but many of which were suppressed at 7 dpi. Systemic shoot tissue of RKN-infected plants showed similar attenuation of expression of almost all studied genes already at 3 dpi, with clear attenuation of the ethylene pathway and methyl jasmonate biosynthesis. These results provide an interesting starting point for further studies to elucidate how nematodes are able to suppress systemic plant defence mechanisms and the effect in multitrophic interactions.
22268146	Two alanine aminotranferases link mitochondrial glycolate oxidation to the major photorespiratory pathway in Arabidopsis and rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	The major photorespiratory pathway in higher plants is distributed over chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. In this pathway, glycolate oxidation takes place in peroxisomes. It was previously suggested that a mitochondrial glycolate dehydrogenase (GlcDH) that was conserved from green algae lacking leaf-type peroxisomes contributes to photorespiration in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, the identification of two Arabidopsis mitochondrial alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferases (ALAATs) that link glycolate oxidation to glycine formation are described. By this reaction, the mitochondrial side pathway produces glycine from glyoxylate that can be used in the glycine decarboxylase (GCD) reaction of the major pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of mitochondrial ALAAT did not result in major changes in metabolite pools under standard conditions or enhanced photorespiratroy flux, respectively. However, RNAi lines showed reduced photorespiratory CO(2) release and a lower CO(2) compensation point. Mitochondria isolated from RNAi lines are incapable of converting glycolate to CO(2), whereas simultaneous overexpression of GlcDH and ALAATs in transiently transformed tobacco leaves enhances glycolate conversion. Furthermore, analyses of rice mitochondria suggest that the side pathway for glycolate oxidation and glycine formation is conserved in monocotyledoneous plants. It is concluded that the photorespiratory pathway from green algae has been functionally conserved in higher plants.
22261864	RNAi-directed down-regulation of RSV results in increased resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Biotechnol Lett	Rice stripe disease (RSD), caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), is a serious disease in temperate rice-growing areas. We have created an RNAi construct containing coat protein gene (CP) and disease specific protein gene (SP) sequences from RSV. The RNAi construct was transformed into two susceptible japonica varieties, Suyunuo and Guanglingxiangjing, to develop resistance against RSD. The homozygous progeny of rice plants in the T(5) and T(7) generations containing RNAi constructs, after self-fertilization were strongly resistant to viral infection. RT-PCR indicated that viral replication of SP and CP in the transgenic plants was significantly inhibited. There were no obvious morphological or developmental differences between the transgenic and wild-type plants from seedling stage to maturity. The excellent agronomic traits of these two varieties, such as high yield and good quality were maintained. Suppression of virus genes using RNAi is therefore a practical and effective strategy for controlling viral infection in crops.

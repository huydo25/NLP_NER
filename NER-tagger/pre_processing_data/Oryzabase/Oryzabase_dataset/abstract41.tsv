27527801	Two novel antimicrobial defensins from rice identified by gene coexpression network analyses.	2016	Peptides	Defensins form an antimicrobial peptides (AMP) family, and have been widely studied in various plants because of their considerable inhibitory functions. However, their roles in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have not been characterized, even though rice is one of the most important staple crops that is susceptible to damaging infections. Additionally, a previous study identified 598 rice genes encoding cysteine-rich peptides, suggesting there are several uncharacterized AMPs in rice. We performed in silico gene expression and coexpression network analyses of all genes encoding defensin and defensin-like peptides, and determined that OsDEF7 and OsDEF8 are coexpressed with pathogen-responsive genes. Recombinant OsDEF7 and OsDEF8 could form homodimers. They inhibited the growth of the bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, and Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.6 to 63μg/mL. However, these OsDEFs are weakly active against the phytopathogenic fungi Helminthosporium oryzae and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense. This study describes a useful method for identifying potential plant AMPs with biological activities.
27176759	Mercury methylation in rice paddies and its possible controlling factors in the Hg mining area, Guizhou province, Southwest China.	2016	Environ Pollut	Understanding mercury (Hg) methylation/demethylation processes and the factors controlling methylmercury (MeHg) production within the rice paddy ecosystem of Hg mining areas is critical to assess the risk of MeHg contamination in rice grain. Two typical Hg-contaminated mining sites, a current-day artisanal site (Gouxi) and an abandoned site (Wukeng), were chosen in this study. We qualified the in situ specific methylation/demethylation rate constants in rice paddy soil during a complete rice-growing season. Our results demonstrate that MeHg levels in rice paddy soil were a function of both methylation and demethylation processes and the net methylation potential in the rice paddy soil reflected the measured MeHg production at any time point. Sulfate stimulating the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was a potentially important metabolic pathway for Hg methylation in rice paddies. We suggest that bioavailable Hg derived from new atmospheric deposition appears to be the primary factor regulating net MeHg production in rice paddies.
27242875	Comparative Transcriptional Profiling of Melatonin Synthesis and Catabolic Genes Indicates the Possible Role of Melatonin in Developmental and Stress Responses in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	As a well-known animal hormone, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is also involved in multiple plant biological processes, especially in various stress responses. Rice is one of the most important crops, and melatonin is taken in by many people everyday from rice. However, the transcriptional profiling of melatonin-related genes in rice is largely unknown. In this study, the expression patterns of 11 melatonin related genes in rice in different periods, tissues, in response to different treatments were synthetically analyzed using published microarray data. These results suggest that the melatonin-related genes may play important and dual roles in rice developmental stages. We highlight the commonly regulation of rice melatonin-related genes by abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), various abiotic stresses and pathogen infection, indicating the possible role of these genes in multiple stress responses and underlying crosstalks of plant hormones, especially ABA and JA. Taken together, this study may provide insight into the association among melatonin biosynthesis and catabolic pathway, plant development and stress responses in rice. The profile analysis identified candidate genes for further functional characterization in circadian rhythm and specific stress responses.
27229732	Overexpression of wheat gene TaMOR improves root system architecture and grain yield in Oryza sativa.	2016	J Exp Bot	Improved root architecture is an effective strategy to increase crop yield. We demonstrate that overexpression of transcription factor gene MORE ROOT (TaMOR) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) results in more roots and higher grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa). TaMOR, encoding a plant-specific transcription factor belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (AS2/LOB) protein family, is highly conserved in wheat and its wild relatives. In this study, tissue expression patterns indicated that TaMOR mainly localizes to root initiation sites. The consistent gene expression pattern suggests that TaMOR is involved in root initiation. Exogenous auxin treatment induced TaMOR expression without de novo protein biosynthesis. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that TaMOR interacts with TaMOR-related protein TaMRRP, which contains a four-tandem-pentatricopeptide repeat motif. Overexpression of TaMOR led to more lateral roots in Arabidopsis thaliana, and TaMOR-overexpressing rice plants had more crown roots, a longer main panicle, a higher number of primary branches on the main panicle, a higher grain number per plant, and higher yield per plant than the plants of wild type. In general, TaMOR-D-overexpressing lines had larger root systems in Arabidopsis and rice, and produce a higher grain yield per plant. TaMOR therefore offers an opportunity to improve root architecture and increase yield in crop plants.
27197779	A resistance locus in the American heirloom rice variety Carolina Gold Select is triggered by TAL effectors with diverse predicted targets and is effective against African strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2016	Plant J	The rice pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar (pv.) oryzae and pv. oryzicola produce numerous transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors that increase bacterial virulence by activating expression of host susceptibility genes. Rice resistance mechanisms against TAL effectors include polymorphisms that prevent effector binding to susceptibility gene promoters, or that allow effector activation of resistance genes. This study identifies, in the heirloom variety Carolina Gold Select, a third mechanism of rice resistance involving TAL effectors. This resistance manifests through strong suppression of disease development in response to diverse TAL effectors from both X. oryzae pathovars. The resistance can be triggered by an effector with only 3.5 central repeats, is independent of the composition of the repeat variable di-residues that determine TAL effector binding specificity, and is independent of the transcriptional activation domain. We determined that the resistance is conferred by a single dominant locus, designated Xo1, that maps to a 1.09 Mbp fragment on chromosome 4. The Xo1 interval also confers complete resistance to the strains in the African clade of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, representing the first dominant resistance locus against bacterial leaf streak in rice. The strong phenotypic similarity between the TAL effector-triggered resistance conferred by Xo1 and that conferred by the tomato resistance gene Bs4 suggests that monocots and dicots share an ancient or convergently evolved mechanism to recognize analogous TAL effector epitopes.
27436946	Mapping QTLs for hybrid sterility in three AA genome wild species of Oryza.	2016	Breed Sci	In order to know the genetic nature of hybrid sterility further, three populations, a BC4F2 population derived from Oryza nivara crossed with Yundao 1, a BC4F2 population derived from O. rufipogon crossed with Yundao 1, and a BC10F1 population derived from a cross between O. barthii and Dianjingyou 1 were developed, respectively. Three hybrid sterility QTLs, qHS-6a, qHS-6b, and qHS-6c, detected from those three populations, were mapped into the region between RM190 and RM510, RM190 and RM3414, RM190 and RM587 on chromosome 6, respectively. These QTLs showed collinearity, and explained 88.24%, 61.52%, 44.46% of the phenotypic variance in pollen fertility and 80.60%, 35.20%, 29.01% of the phenotypic variance in spikelet fertility, respectively. In all three crosses, the gametes carrying Yundao 1 or Dianjingyou 1 alleles were eliminated by gametes carrying the wild species alleles. Comparison of the location and the mode of gene action of three QTLs correspond to the S1 locus indicates a common and conserved hybrid sterility locus in AA genome specie playing an important role in reproductive barriers in Oryza. Fine mapping of these QTLs would lead to understand the micro-collinearity and evolutionary relationship among Oryza species.
27178300	QTLs for Resistance to Major Rice Diseases Exacerbated by Global Warming: Brown Spot, Bacterial Seedling Rot, and Bacterial Grain Rot.	2016	Rice (N Y)	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), damage from diseases such as brown spot, caused by Bipolaris oryzae, and bacterial seedling rot and bacterial grain rot, caused by Burkholderia glumae, has increased under global warming because the optimal temperature ranges for growth of these pathogens are relatively high (around 30 °C). Therefore, the need for cultivars carrying genes for resistance to these diseases is increasing to ensure sustainable rice production. In contrast to the situation for other important rice diseases such as blast and bacterial blight, no genes for complete resistance to brown spot, bacterial seedling rot or bacterial grain rot have yet been discovered. Thus, rice breeders have to use partial resistance, which is largely influenced by environmental conditions. Recent progress in molecular genetics and improvement of evaluation methods for disease resistance have facilitated detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance. In this review, we summarize the results of worldwide screening for cultivars with resistance to brown spot, bacterial seedling rot and bacterial grain rot and we discuss the identification of QTLs conferring resistance to these diseases in order to provide useful information for rice breeding programs.
27187354	Hairpin RNA Targeting Multiple Viral Genes Confers Strong Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) belongs to the genus Fijivirus in the family of Reoviridae and causes severe yield loss in rice-producing areas in Asia. RNA silencing, as a natural defence mechanism against plant viruses, has been successfully exploited for engineering virus resistance in plants, including rice. In this study, we generated transgenic rice lines harbouring a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) construct targeting four RBSDV genes, S1, S2, S6 and S10, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the putative core protein, the RNA silencing suppressor and the outer capsid protein, respectively. Both field nursery and artificial inoculation assays of three generations of the transgenic lines showed that they had strong resistance to RBSDV infection. The RBSDV resistance in the segregating transgenic populations correlated perfectly with the presence of the hpRNA transgene. Furthermore, the hpRNA transgene was expressed in the highly resistant transgenic lines, giving rise to abundant levels of 21-24 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA). By small RNA deep sequencing, the RBSDV-resistant transgenic lines detected siRNAs from all four viral gene sequences in the hpRNA transgene, indicating that the whole chimeric fusion sequence can be efficiently processed by Dicer into siRNAs. Taken together, our results suggest that long hpRNA targeting multiple viral genes can be used to generate stable and durable virus resistance in rice, as well as other plant species.
27194741	The α-subunit of the rice heterotrimeric G protein, RGA1, regulates drought tolerance during the vegetative phase in the dwarf rice mutant d1.	2016	J Exp Bot	Essential in the Green Revolution was the development of high-yielding dwarf varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.), but their selection was not based on responses to water limitation. We studied physiological responses to progressive drought of the dwarf rice mutant, d1, in which the RGA1 gene, which encodes the GTP-binding α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional. Wild-type (WT) plants cease net carbon fixation 11 days after water is withheld, while d1 plants maintain net photosynthesis for an additional week. During drought, d1 plants exhibit greater stomatal conductance than the WT, but both genotypes exhibit the same transpirational water loss per unit leaf area. This is explained by a smaller driving force for water loss in d1 owing to its lower leaf temperatures, consistent with its more erect architecture. As drought becomes more severe, WT plants show an accelerated decline in photosynthesis, which may be exacerbated by the higher leaf temperatures in the WT. We thus show how a rice mutant with dwarf and erect leaves has a decreased susceptibility to water stress. Accordingly, it may be useful to incorporate RGA1 mutation in breeding or biotechnological strategies for development of drought-resistant rice.
27242842	Expression of a Codon-Optimized dsdA Gene in Tobacco Plastids and Rice Nucleus Confers D-Serine Tolerance.	2016	Front Plant Sci	D-serine is toxic to plants. D-serine ammonia lyase, which is encoded by the dsdA gene, can attenuate this toxicity with high specificity. In the present study, we explored the function of codon-optimized dsdA with tobacco plastids and rice nuclear transformation system. It was shown that dsdA gene was site-specifically integrated into the tobacco plastid genome and displayed a high level of expression. Genetic analysis of the progenies showed that dsdA gene is maternally inherited and confers sufficient D-serine resistance in tobacco. The effective screening concentrations of D-serine for seed germination, callus regeneration and foliar spray were 10, 30, and 75 mM, respectively. In addition, calluses from homozygous transgenic rice lines also showed significant tolerance to D-serine (up to 75 mM). Our study proves the feasibility of using dsdA gene as a selectable marker in both plastid and nuclear transformation systems.
27142801	Allele-specific marker-based assessment revealed that the rice blast resistance genes Pi2 and Pi9 have not been widely deployed in Chinese indica rice cultivars.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The most sustainable approach to control rice blast disease is to develop durably resistant cultivars. In molecular breeding for rice blast resistance, markers developed based on polymorphisms between functional and non-functional alleles of resistance genes, can provide precise and accurate selection of resistant genotypes without the need for difficult, laborious and time-consuming phenotyping. The Pi2 and Pi9 genes confer broad-spectrum resistance against diverse blast isolates. Development of allele-specific markers for Pi2 and Pi9 would facilitate breeding of blast resistant rice by using the two blast resistance genes.

RESULT: In this work, we developed two new markers, named Pi9-Pro and Pi2-LRR respectively, targeting the unique polymorphisms of the resistant and susceptible alleles of Pi2 and of Pi9. The InDel marker Pi9-Pro differentiates three different genotypes corresponding to the Pi2/Piz-t, Pi9 and non-Pi2/Piz-t/Pi9 alleles, and the CAPS marker Pi2-LRR differentiates the Pi2 allele from the non-Pi2 allele. Based on the two newly developed markers and two available markers Pi2SNP and Pi9SNP, the presence of Pi2 and Pi9 was assessed in a set of 434 rice accessions consisting of 377 Chinese indica cultivars/breeding materials and 57 Chinese japonica cultivars/breeding materials. Of the 434 accessions tested, while one indica restorer line Huazhan was identified harboring the Pi2 resistance allele, no other rice line was identified harboring the Pi2 or Pi9 resistance alleles.

CONCLUSIONS: Allele-specific marker-based assessment revealed that Pi2 and Pi9 have not been widely incorporated into diverse Chinese indica rice cultivars. Thus, the two blast resistance genes can be new gene sources for developing blast resistant rice, especially indica rice, in China. The two newly developed markers should be highly useful for using Pi2 and Pi9 in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding programs.
27165311	Marker-free transgenic rice expressing the vegetative insecticidal protein (Vip) of Bacillus thuringiensis shows broad insecticidal properties.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Genetically engineered rice lines with broad insecticidal properties against major lepidopteran pests were generated using a synthetic, truncated form of vegetative insecticidal protein (Syn vip3BR) from Bacillus thuringiensis. The selectable marker gene and the redundant transgene(s) were eliminated through Cre/ lox mediated recombination and genetic segregation to make consumer friendly Bt -rice. For sustainable resistance against lepidopteran insect pests, chloroplast targeted synthetic version of bioactive core component of a vegetative insecticidal protein (Syn vip3BR) of Bacillus thuringiensis was expressed in rice under the control of green-tissue specific ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit gene promoter. The transgenic plants (in Oryza sativa indica Swarna cultivar) showed high insect mortality rate in vitro against major rice pests, yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas), rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and rice horn caterpillar (Melanitis leda ismene) in T1 generation, indicating insecticidal potency of Syn vip3BR. Under field conditions, the T1 plants showed considerable resistance against leaf folders and stem borers. The expression cassette (vip-lox-hpt-lox) as well as another vector with chimeric cre recombinase gene under constitutive rice ubiquitin1 gene promoter was designed for the elimination of selectable marker hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) gene. Crossing experiments were performed between T1 plants with single insertion site of vip-lox-hpt-lox T-DNA and one T1 plant with moderate expression of cre recombinase with linked bialaphos resistance (syn bar) gene. Marker gene excision was achieved in hybrids with up to 41.18 % recombination efficiency. Insect resistant transgenic lines, devoid of selectable marker and redundant transgene(s) (hptII + cre-syn bar), were established in subsequent generation through genetic segregation.
27209244	The availabilities of arsenic and cadmium in rice paddy fields from a mining area: The role of soil extractable and plant silicon.	2016	Environ Pollut	Adequate silicon (Si) can greatly boost rice yield and improve grain quality through alleviating stresses associated with heavy metals and metalloids such as arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd). The soil plant-available Si is relatively low in South China due to severe desilicification and allitization of the soils in this region. Conversely, pollution of heavy metals and metalloids in the soils of this region occurs widely, especially As and Cd pollution in paddy soil. Therefore, evaluating the plant availability of Si in paddy soil of South China and examining its correlation with the availability of heavy metals and metalloids are of great significance. Accordingly, in our study, 107 pairs of soil and rice plant samples were collected from paddy fields contaminated by As and Cd in South China. Significantly positive correlations between Si in rice plants and Si fractions in soils extracted with citric acid, NaOAc-HOAc buffer, and oxalate-ammonium oxalate buffer suggest that these extractants are more suitable for use in extracting plant-available Si in the soils of our present study. Significantly negative correlations between different Si fractions and As or Cd in rice plant tissues and negative exponential correlations between the molar ratios of Si to As/Cd in rice roots, straws, husks or grains and As/Cd in rice grains indicate that Si can significantly alleviate the accumulation of As/Cd from soils to the rice plants. Finally, a contribution assessment of soil properties to As/Cd accumulation in rice grains based on random forest showed that in addition to Si concentrations in soil or rice plants, other factors such as Fe fractions and total phosphorus also contributed largely to As/Cd accumulation in rice grains. Overall, Si exhibited its unique role in mitigating As or Cd stress in rice, and our study results provide strong field evidence for this role.
27050577	Identification of a Pi9-Containing Rice Germplasm with a Newly Developed Robust Marker.	2016	Phytopathology	The Pi9 gene in rice, originating from Oryza minuta, is an effective resistance gene for controlling rice blast disease. However, currently available linked DNA markers do not accurately identify the function of Pi9, thus hindering its efficient incorporation into new cultivars through marker-assisted selection (MAS). In addition, no known Pi9-containing rice germplasm is available to breeders. In the present study, DNA sequence variation of Pi9 alleles and their family members was analyzed in 40 diverse rice germplasm accessions from the AA genome to develop a robust Pi9 marker. In total, 29 DNA primers of 20 to 23 nucleotides were designed and each possible combination of primer pairs was used to detect Pi9. Only one combination of DNA primers, KS28/KS6, was identified to specifically detect Pi9 in the monogenic line IRBL9-W. The presence of Pi9 was verified with the predicted Pi9-specific blast reaction. Subsequently, 201 genetically diverse mini-core rice accessions from 114 countries were screened with KS28/KS6. One germplasm, IR 9660-48-1-1-2, was identified to carry Pi9 and the function of Pi9 was verified with pathogenicity assays. This robust Pi9 marker and a rice germplasm, IR9660-48-1-1-2 (GSOR310687), carrying Pi9 can be used to improve blast resistance with a MAS approach.
27211925	The Fd-GOGAT1 mutant gene lc7 confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Disease resistance is an important goal of crop improvement. The molecular mechanism of resistance requires further study. Here, we report the identification of a rice leaf color mutant, lc7, which is defective in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis but confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo). Map-based cloning revealed that lc7 encodes a mutant ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase1 (Fd-GOGAT1). Fd-GOGAT1 has been proposed to have great potential for improving nitrogen-use efficiency, but its function in bacterial resistance has not been reported. The lc7 mutant accumulates excessive levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in the leaves, causing the leaf color to become yellow after the four-leaf stage. Compared to the wild type, lc7 mutants have a broad-spectrum high resistance to seven Xoo strains. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and qRT-PCR analysis indicate that many defense pathways that are involved in this broad-spectrum resistance are activated in the lc7 mutant. These results suggest that Fd-GOGAT1 plays an important role in broad-spectrum bacterial blight resistance, in addition to modulating nitrogen assimilation and chloroplast development.
27173349	Expression profile of rice Hsp genes under anoxic stress.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Although flooding is one of the most important environmental stresses worldwide, not all plant species are intolerant to its effects. Species from semi-aquatic environments, such as rice, have the capacity to cope with flooding stress. Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) are thought to contribute to cellular homeostasis under both optimal and adverse growth conditions. Studies of gene expression in plants exposed to low levels of oxygen revealed the up-regulation of Hsp genes. However, it is not clear whether Hsp genes are transcribed as a function of tolerance or whether they represent a response to anoxic stress. Therefore, the accumulation of Hsp gene transcripts was investigated in two different cultivars, "Nipponbare" (flooding tolerant) and "IPSL 2070" (flooding sensitive), subjected to anoxic stress. Fifteen-day-old rice root seedlings from both cultivars were used. Four different treatments were performed: no anoxia (control); 24-h anoxia; 48-h anoxia; and 72-h anoxia. Anoxic stress was confirmed by the increased gene expression of alcohol dehydrogenase. The data obtained showed that both rice cultivars ("Nipponbare" and "IPSL 2070") accumulated Hsp gene transcripts under anoxic stress; however, the majority of the Hsp genes evaluated were responsive to anoxic stress in "IPSL 2070" (flooding sensitive), whereas in "Nipponbare" (flooding tolerant), only six genes were highly up-regulated. This suggests that although Hsps have an important role in the response to anoxia, they are not the major cause of tolerance.
27208229	Features of Rice DNA Methylation Pathways in Floral Symmetry.	2016	Plant Physiol	All members of Asteraceae, the largest flowering family, have a unique compressed inflorescence known as a capitulum, which resembles a solitary flower. The capitulum often consists of bilateral (zygomorphic) ray florets and radial (actinomorphic) disc florets. In Antirrhinum majus, floral zygomorphy is established by the interplay between dorsal petal identity genes, CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and RADIALIS (RAD), and a ventral gene DIVARICATA (DIV). To investigate the role of CYC, RAD, and DIV in the development of ray and disc florets within a capitulum, we isolated homologs of these genes from an Asteraceae species, Senecio vulgaris (common groundsel). After initial uniform expression of RAY3 (CYC), SvRAD, and SvDIV1B in ray florets only, RAY3 and SvRAD were exclusively expressed in the ventral petals of the ray florets. Our functional analysis further showed that RAY3 promotes and SvDIV1B represses petal growth, confirming their roles in floral zygomorphy. Our results highlight that while floral symmetry genes such as RAY3 and SvDIV1B appear to have a conserved role in petal growth in both Senecio and Antirrhinum, the regulatory relationships and expression domains are divergent, allowing ventral petal elongation in Senecio versus dorsal petal elongation in Antirrhinum In S vulgaris, diversification of CYC genes has led to novel interactions; SvDIV1B inhibits RAY3 and SvRAD, and may activate RAY2 This highlights how recruitment of floral symmetry regulators into dynamic networks was crucial for creating a complex and elaborate structure such as the capitulum.
27126515	Magnaporthe oryzae Effector AVR-Pii Helps to Establish Compatibility by Inhibition of the Rice NADP-Malic Enzyme Resulting in Disruption of Oxidative Burst and Host Innate Immunity.	2016	Mol Cells	Plant disease resistance occurs as a hypersensitive response (HR) at the site of attempted pathogen invasion. This specific event is initiated in response to recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and subsequent PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Both PTI and ETI mechanisms are tightly connected with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and disease resistance that involves distinct biphasic ROS production as one of its pivotal plant immune responses. This unique oxidative burst is strongly dependent on the resistant cultivars because a monophasic ROS burst is a hallmark of the susceptible cultivars. However, the cause of the differential ROS burst remains unknown. In the study here, we revealed the plausible underlying mechanism of the differential ROS burst through functional understanding of the Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) AVR effector, AVR-Pii. We performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using AVR-Pii as bait and isolated rice NADP-malic enzyme2 (Os-NADP-ME2) as the rice target protein. To our surprise, deletion of the rice Os-NADP-ME2 gene in a resistant rice cultivar disrupted innate immunity against the rice blast fungus. Malic enzyme activity and inhibition studies demonstrated that AVR-Pii proteins specifically inhibit in vitro NADP-ME activity. Overall, we demonstrate that rice blast fungus, M. oryzae attenuates the host ROS burst via AVR-Pii-mediated inhibition of Os-NADP-ME2, which is indispensable in ROS metabolism for the innate immunity of rice. This characterization of the regulation of the host oxidative burst will help to elucidate how the products of AVR genes function associated with virulence of the pathogen.
27297991	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit 2 is essential for storage substance accumulation and subunit interactions in rice endosperm.	2016	Plant Sci	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) controls a rate-limiting step in the starch biosynthetic pathway in higher plants. Here we isolated a shrunken rice mutant w24. Map-based cloning identified OsAGPL2, a large subunit of the cytosolic AGPase in rice endosperm, as the gene responsible for the w24 mutation. In addition to severe inhibition of starch synthesis and significant accumulation of sugar, the w24 endosperm showed obvious defects in compound granule formation and storage protein synthesis. The defect in OsAGPL2 enhanced the expression levels of the AGPase family. Meanwhile, the elevated activities of starch phosphorylase 1 and sucrose synthase in the w24 endosperm might possibly partly account for the residual starch content in the mutant seeds. Moreover, the expression of OsAGPL2 and its counterpart, OsAGPS2b, was highly coordinated in rice endosperm. Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays verified direct interactions between OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b as well as OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1, supporting the model for spatiotemporal complex formation of AGPase isoforms in rice endosperm. Besides, our data provided no evidence for the self-binding of OsAGPS2b, implying that OsAGPS2b might not interact to form higher molecular mass aggregates in the absence of OsAGPL2. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of rice AGPase assembly might differ from that of Arabidopsis.
27137867	CSN6, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, is involved in early response to iron deficiency in Oryza sativa.	2016	Sci Rep	The COP9 signalosome (CSN) plays an important role in proteasome-mediated degradation by regulating CUL1 rubylation of the SCF ligase and is involved in many crucial biological processes. Here, we demonstrate a link between IDEF1 accumulation and the decline in COP9 derubylation activity in response to iron deficiency (-Fe) in rice (Oryza sativa). CSN6 expression is rapidly down-regulated during Fe depletion, contributing to reduced CSN activity, as judged by CSN5 and CUL1 expression, indicating CSN6 is involved in the early stage response of -Fe. In contrast to CSN6, the IDEF1 protein and expression of several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes are increased in response to -Fe. Thus, we constructed CSN6 transgenic sense and antisense lines and found that experimental depletion of CSN6 results in accumulation of the IDEF1 protein and up-regulation of several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes. Furthermore, IDEF1 can be decorated with K48-linked polyubiquitin and degraded via the 26S proteasome. Accumulated IDEF1 in antisense lines led to increased chlorophyll and Fe content in seedlings during -Fe. Collectively, the cellular CSN6 level is decreased during early stages of -Fe to ensure the rapid accumulation of IDEF1, which in turn up-regulates several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes to help overcome -Fe stress in rice.
27220955	Metabolism of L-arabinose in plants.	2016	J Plant Res	L-Arabinose (L-Ara) is a plant-specific sugar accounting for 5-10 % of cell wall saccharides in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). L-Ara occurs in pectic arabinan, rhamnogalacturonan II, arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan-protein (AGP), and extensin in the cell walls, as well as in glycosylated signaling peptides like CLAVATA3 and small glycoconjugates such as quercetin 3-O-arabinoside. This review focuses on recent advances towards understanding the generation of L-Ara and the metabolism of L-Ara-containing molecules in plants.
27174847	Plant phosphomannose isomerase as a selectable marker for rice transformation.	2016	Sci Rep	The E. coli phosphomannose isomerase (EcPMI) gene is widely used as a selectable marker gene (SMG) in mannose (Man) selection-based plant transformation. Although some plant species exhibit significant PMI activity and active PMIs were even identified in Man-sensitive plants, whether plant PMIs can be used as SMGs remains unclear. In this study, we isolated four novel PMI genes from Chlorella variabilis and Oryza sativa. Their isoenzymatic activities were examined in vitro and compared with that of EcPMI. The active plant PMIs were separately constructed into binary vectors as SMGs and then transformed into rice via Agrobacterium. In both Indica and Japonica subspecies, our results indicated that the plant PMIs could select and produce transgenic plants in a pattern similar to that of EcPMI. The transgenic plants exhibited an accumulation of plant PMI transcripts and enhancement of the in vivo PMI activity. Furthermore, a gene of interest was successfully transformed into rice using the plant PMIs as SMGs. Thus, novel SMGs for Man selection were isolated from plants, and our analysis suggested that PMIs encoding active enzymes might be common in plants and could potentially be used as appropriate genetic elements in cisgenesis engineering.
27242831	Characterization of Rice Homeobox Genes, OsHOX22 and OsHOX24, and Over-expression of OsHOX24 in Transgenic Arabidopsis Suggest Their Role in Abiotic Stress Response.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Homeobox transcription factors are well known regulators of plant growth and development. In this study, we carried out functional analysis of two candidate stress-responsive HD-ZIP I class homeobox genes from rice, OsHOX22, and OsHOX24. These genes were highly up-regulated under various abiotic stress conditions at different stages of rice development, including seedling, mature and reproductive stages. The transcript levels of these genes were enhanced significantly in the presence of plant hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, salicylic acid, and gibberellic acid. The recombinant full-length and truncated homeobox proteins were found to be localized in the nucleus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay established the binding of these homeobox proteins with specific DNA sequences, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG) and AH2 (CAAT(C/G)ATTG). Transactivation assays in yeast revealed the transcriptional activation potential of full-length OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 proteins. Homo- and hetero-dimerization capabilities of these proteins have also been demonstrated. Further, we identified putative novel interacting proteins of OsHOX22 and OsHOX24 via yeast-two hybrid analysis. Over-expression of OsHOX24 imparted higher sensitivity to stress hormone, ABA, and abiotic stresses in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants as revealed by various physiological and phenotypic assays. Microarray analysis revealed differential expression of several stress-responsive genes in transgenic lines as compared to wild-type. Many of these genes were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation and various metabolic pathways. Altogether, our results suggest the possible role of OsHOX22/OsHOX24 homeobox proteins as negative regulators in abiotic stress responses.
27070427	Coevolutionary Dynamics of Rice Blast Resistance Gene Pi-ta and Magnaporthe oryzae Avirulence Gene AVR-Pita 1.	2016	Phytopathology	The Pi-ta gene in rice is effective in preventing infections by Magnaporthe oryzae strains that contain the corresponding avirulence gene, AVR-Pita1. Diverse haplotypes of AVR-Pita1 have been identified from isolates of M. oryzae from rice production areas in the United States and worldwide. DNA sequencing and mapping studies have revealed that AVR-Pita1 is highly unstable, while expression analysis and quantitative resistance loci mapping of the Pi-ta locus revealed complex evolutionary mechanisms of Pi-ta-mediated resistance. Among these studies, several Pi-ta transcripts were identified, most of which are probably derived from alternative splicing and exon skipping, which could produce functional resistance proteins that support a new concept of coevolution of Pi-ta and AVR-Pita1. User-friendly DNA markers for Pi-ta have been developed to support marker-assisted selection, and development of new rice varieties with the Pi-ta markers. Genome-wide association studies revealed a link between Pi-ta-mediated resistance and yield components suggesting that rice has evolved a complicated defense mechanism against the blast fungus. In this review, we detail the current understanding of Pi-ta allelic variation, its linkage with rice productivity, AVR-Pita allelic variation, and the coevolution of Pi-ta and AVR-Pita in Oryza species and M. oryzae populations, respectively. We also review the genetic and molecular basis of Pi-ta and AVR-Pita interaction, and its value in marker-assisted selection and engineering resistance.
27213684	Over-expression of a NAC 67 transcription factor from finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) confers tolerance against salinity and drought stress in rice.	2016	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: NAC proteins (NAM (No apical meristem), ATAF (Arabidopsis transcription activation factor) and CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)) are plant-specific transcription factors reported to be involved in regulating growth, development and stress responses. Salinity responsive transcriptome profiling in a set of contrasting finger millet genotypes through RNA-sequencing resulted in the identification of a NAC homolog (EcNAC 67) exhibiting differential salinity responsive expression pattern.

METHODS: Full length cDNA of EcNAC67 was isolated, characterized and validated for its role in abiotic stress tolerance through agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation in a rice cultivar ASD16.

RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis of putative NAC transcription factor (TF) isolated from a salinity tolerant finger millet showed its genetic relatedness to NAC67 family TFs in related cereals. Putative transgenic lines of rice over-expressing EcNAC67 were generated through Agrobacterium mediated transformation and presence/integration of transgene was confirmed through PCR and southern hybridization analysis. Transgenic rice plants harboring EcNAC67 showed enhanced tolerance against drought and salinity under greenhouse conditions. Transgenic rice plants were found to possess higher root and shoot biomass during stress and showed better revival ability upon relief from salinity stress. Upon drought stress, transgenic lines were found to maintain higher relative water content and lesser reduction in grain yield when compared to non-transgenic ASD16 plants. Drought induced spikelet sterility was found to be much lower in the transgenic lines than the non-transgenic ASD16.

CONCLUSION: Results revealed the significant role of EcNAC67 in modulating responses against dehydration stress in rice. No detectable abnormalities in the phenotypic traits were observed in the transgenic plants under normal growth conditions. Results indicate that EcNAC67 can be used as a novel source for engineering tolerance against drought and salinity stress in rice and other crop plants.
27169562	Ethylene-dependent aerenchyma formation in adventitious roots is regulated differently in rice and maize.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	In roots of gramineous plants, lysigenous aerenchyma is created by the death and lysis of cortical cells. Rice (Oryza sativa) constitutively forms aerenchyma under aerobic conditions, and its formation is further induced under oxygen-deficient conditions. However, maize (Zea mays) develops aerenchyma only under oxygen-deficient conditions. Ethylene is involved in lysigenous aerenchyma formation. Here, we investigated how ethylene-dependent aerenchyma formation is differently regulated between rice and maize. For this purpose, in rice, we used the reduced culm number1 (rcn1) mutant, in which ethylene biosynthesis is suppressed. Ethylene is converted from 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the action of ACC oxidase (ACO). We found that OsACO5 was highly expressed in the wild type, but not in rcn1, under aerobic conditions, suggesting that OsACO5 contributes to aerenchyma formation in aerated rice roots. By contrast, the ACO genes in maize roots were weakly expressed under aerobic conditions, and thus ACC treatment did not effectively induce ethylene production or aerenchyma formation, unlike in rice. Aerenchyma formation in rice roots after the initiation of oxygen-deficient conditions was faster and greater than that in maize. These results suggest that the difference in aerenchyma formation in rice and maize is due to their different mechanisms for regulating ethylene biosynthesis.
27436945	Mapping quantitative trait loci for heat tolerance at anthesis in rice using chromosomal segment substitution lines.	2016	Breed Sci	To study the genetic basis of heat tolerance at anthesis, a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from Sasanishiki (japonica ssp. heat susceptible) and Habataki (indica spp. heat tolerant) were used for analysis across three high temperature environments. Spikelet fertility (SF), daily flowering time (DFT) and pollen shedding level (PSL) under high temperature (HT) were assessed. Eleven related QTLs were detected, of which, two QTLs qSF (ht) 2 and qSF (ht) 4.2 for spikelet fertility were identified on chromosomes 2 and 4. Four QTLs qDFT3, qDFT8, qDFT10.1 and qDFT11 for daily flowering time were detected on chromosomes 3, 8, 10 and 11. The other five QTLs qPSL (ht) 1, qPSL (ht) 4.1, qPSL (ht) 5, qPSL (ht) 7 and qPSL (ht) 10.2 on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7 and 10, respectively, were found had effects both on spikelet fertility and pollen shedding level. Of the 11 QTLs, 8 were overlapped with QTLs reported by others, 3 QTLs qPSL (ht) 4.1, qPSL (ht) 7 and qPSL (ht) 10.2 identified in this study were novel. The stability of qPSL (ht) 4.1 was further verified at different temperatures, which could be used to improve the pollen shedding and pollen growth on stigma for rice heat-tolerance breeding.
27323093	Comparative analysis of MIR168 promoters in three plant species.	2016	Genet Mol Res	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression by post-transcriptionally targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miR168 is a key miRNA because it regulates the expression of the slicer protein ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), which catalyzes mRNA cleavage. Interestingly, plant miR168s are highly evolutionarily conserved; however, it is unclear whether MIR168 promoter elements and expression patterns are also conserved. Here, we isolated MIR168 promoters from monocot rice and dicot grape genomes. To determine the expression pattern, different promoters were fused to a beta-glucoronidase reporter gene and the resulting constructs were then transformed in Arabidopsis. The results revealed clear differences in the MIR168 promoter sequence of monocot and dicot plant species. Moreover, the pattern of MIR168 promoter expression differed between monocots and dicots. These results suggest that, unlike that of miR168, the MIR168 promoter is not conserved in monocots and dicots.
27215671	Production and immunogenicity of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae ApxIIA protein in transgenic rice callus.	2017	Protein Expr Purif	Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a major etiological agent that is responsible for swine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory infection that causes severe economic losses in the swine production industry. ApxIIA is one of the virulence factors in A. pleuropneumoniae and has been considered as a candidate for developing a vaccine against the bacterial infection. A gene encoding an ApxIIA fragment (amino acids 439-801) was modified based on a plant-optimized codon and constructed into a plant expression vector under the control of a promoter and the 3' UTR of the rice amylase 3D gene. The plant expression vector was introduced into rice embryogenic callus (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) via particle bombardment-mediated transformation. The integration and transcription of the ApxIIA439-801 gene were confirmed by using genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The synthesis of ApxIIA439-801 antigen protein in transgenic rice callus was confirmed by western blot analysis. The concentration of antigen protein in lyophilized samples of transgenic rice callus was 250 μg/g. Immunizing mice with protein extracts from transgenic plants intranasally elicited secretory IgA. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a transgenic plant to elicit immune responses against A. pleuropneumoniae.
27240428	Jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine is required for the production of a flavonoid phytoalexin but not diterpenoid phytoalexins in ultraviolet-irradiated rice leaves.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rice produces low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds known as phytoalexins, in response to not only pathogen attack but also abiotic stresses including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Rice phytoalexins are composed of diterpenoids and a flavonoid. Recent studies have indicated that endogenous jasmonyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is not necessarily required for the production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in blast-infected or CuCl2-treated rice leaves. However, JA-Ile is required for the accumulation of the flavonoid phytoalexin, sakuranetin. Here, we investigated the roles of JA-Ile in UV-induced phytoalexin production. We showed that UV-irradiation induces the biosynthesis of JA-Ile and its precursor jasmonic acid. We also showed that rice jasmonate biosynthesis mutants produced diterpenoid phytoalexins but not sakuranetin in response to UV, indicating that JA-Ile is required for the production of sakuranetin but not diterpenoid phytoalexins in UV-irradiated rice leaves.
27246014	Marker assisted pyramiding of two brown planthopper resistance genes, Bph3 and Bph27 (t), into elite rice Cultivars.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive insect in rice production. Breeding of resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective and environment-friendly strategy for BPH management; however, resistant cultivars are currently hampered by the rapid breakdown of BPH resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to use more effective BPH resistance genes or pyramiding different resistance genes to develop more durable resistant rice cultivars.

RESULTS: Here a dominant BPH resistance gene Bph27(t) were introgressed into a susceptible commercial japonica variety Ningjing3 (NJ3) and indica variety 93-11 using marker-assisted selection (MAS), respectively. Further, Bph27(t) and a durable BPH resistance gene Bph3 was pyramided by intercrossing single-gene introgressed lines through MAS. The introgression of BPH resistance genes significantly improved the BPH resistance and reduced the yield loss caused by BPH.

CONCLUSION: The development of single and two genes pyramided lines in this study provides innovative resources for molecular breeding of durable BPH-resistant rice cultivars and BPH management through resistant cultivars.

27335351	N-Glycomic and Microscopic Subcellular Localization Analyses of NPP1, 2 and 6 Strongly Indicate that trans-Golgi Compartments Participate in the Golgi to Plastid Traffic of Nucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterases in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (NPPs) are widely distributed N-glycosylated enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic breakdown of numerous nucleotides and nucleotide sugars. In many plant species, NPPs are encoded by a small multigene family, which in rice are referred to NPP1-NPP6 Although recent investigations showed that N-glycosylated NPP1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi system to the chloroplast through the secretory pathway in rice cells, information on N-glycan composition and subcellular localization of other NPPs is still lacking. Computer-assisted analyses of the amino acid sequences deduced from different Oryza sativa NPP-encoding cDNAs predicted all NPPs to be secretory glycoproteins. Confocal fluorescence microscopy observation of cells expressing NPP2 and NPP6 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that NPP2 and NPP6 are plastidial proteins. Plastid targeting of NPP2-GFP and NPP6-GFP was prevented by brefeldin A and by the expression of ARF1(Q71L), a dominant negative mutant of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 that arrests the ER to Golgi traffic, indicating that NPP2 and NPP6 are transported from the ER-Golgi to the plastidial compartment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted electron microscopy analyses of transgenic rice cells ectopically expressing the trans-Golgi marker sialyltransferase fused with GFP showed the occurrence of contact of Golgi-derived membrane vesicles with cargo and subsequent absorption into plastids. Sensitive and high-throughput glycoblotting/mass spectrometric analyses showed that complex-type and paucimannosidic-type glycans with fucose and xylose residues occupy approximately 80% of total glycans of NPP1, NPP2 and NPP6. The overall data strongly indicate that the trans-Golgi compartments participate in the Golgi to plastid trafficking and targeting mechanism of NPPs.
26976728	Incorporation of Bacterial Blight Resistance Genes Into Lowland Rice Cultivar Through Marker-Assisted Backcross Breeding.	2016	Phytopathology	Bacterial blight (BB) of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is a major disease of rice in many rice growing countries. Pyramided lines carrying two BB resistance gene combinations (Xa21+xa13 and Xa21+xa5) were developed in a lowland cultivar Jalmagna background through backcross breeding by integrating molecular markers. In each backcross generation, markers closely linked to the disease resistance genes were used to select plants possessing the target genes. Background selection was continued in those plants carrying resistant genes until BC(3) generation. Plants having the maximum contribution from the recurrent parent genome were selected in each generation and hybridized with the recipient parent. The BB-pyramided line having the maximum recipient parent genome recovery of 95% was selected among BC3F1 plants and selfed to isolate homozygous BC(3)F(2) plants with different combinations of BB resistance genes. Twenty pyramided lines with two resistance gene combinations exhibited high levels of tolerance against the BB pathogen. In order to confirm the resistance, the pyramided lines were inoculated with different X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains of Odisha for bioassay. The genotypes with combination of two BB resistance genes conferred high levels of resistance to the predominant X. oryzae pv. oryzae isolates prevalent in the region. The pyramided lines showed similarity with the recipient parent with respect to major agro-morphologic traits.
27182958	Seed-borne endophytic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 produces gibberellins and regulates endogenous phytohormones of Oryza sativa.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Some microorganisms are adapted to an endophytic mode, living symbiotically with plants through vertical transmission in seeds. The role of plant growth-promoting endophytes has been well studied, but those of seed-associated endophytic bacteria are less understood. The current study aimed to isolate and identify bacterial endophytes associated with rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Jin so mi') seeds, their potential to produce gibberellins (GAs), and role in improving host-plant physiology. The isolated bacterial endophyte RWL-1 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by using 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The pure culture of B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1, supplied with deuterated internal standards, was subjected to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric selected ion monitoring (GC-MS/SIM) for quantification of GAs. Results showed the presence of GAs in various quantities (ng/mL) viz., GA20 (17.88 ± 4.04), GA36 (5.75 ± 2.36), GA24 (5.64 ± 2.46), GA4 (1.02 ± 0.16), GA53 (0.772 ± 0.20), GA9 (0.12 ± 0.09), GA19 (0.093 ± 0.13), GA5 (0.08 ± 0.04), GA12 (0.014 ± 0.34), and GA8 (0.013 ± 0.01). Since endogenous seed GAs are essential for prolonged seed growth and subsequent plant development, we used exogenous GA3 as a positive control and water as a negative control for comparative analysis of the application of B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 to rice plants. The growth parameters of rice plants treated with endophytic bacterial cell application was significantly increased compared to the plants treated with exogenous GA3 and water. This was also revealed by the significant up-regulation of endogenous GA1 (17.54 ± 2.40 ng), GA4 (310 ± 5.41 ng), GA7 (192.60 ± 3.32 ng), and GA9 (19.04 ± 2.49 ng) as compared to results of the positive and negative control treatments. Rice plants inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 exhibited significantly higher endogenous salicylic acid (1615.06 ± 10.81 μg), whereas endogenous abscisic acid (23.31 ± 2.76 ng) and jasmonic acid (25.51 ± 4.20 ng) were observed to be significantly lower in these inoculated plants than in those treated with exogenous GA3 and water. Results of the present study suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens RWL-1 has the ability to produce GAs and that its inoculation in seedlings can be beneficial to rice plants. Broader field trials should be conducted to determine its use as an alternative biofertilizer.
27133567	Evolutionary trajectory of phytoalexin biosynthetic gene clusters in rice.	2016	Plant J	Plants frequently possess operon-like gene clusters for specialized metabolism. Cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, produces antimicrobial diterpene phytoalexins represented by phytocassanes and momilactones, and the majority of their biosynthetic genes are clustered on chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively. These labdane-related diterpene phytoalexins are biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl diphosphate via ent-copalyl diphosphate or syn-copalyl diphosphate. The two gene clusters consist of genes encoding diterpene synthases and chemical-modification enzymes including P450s. In contrast, genes for the biosynthesis of gibberellins, which are labdane-related phytohormones, are scattered throughout the rice genome similar to other plant genomes. The mechanism of operon-like gene cluster formation remains undefined despite previous studies in other plant species. Here we show an evolutionary insight into the rice gene clusters by a comparison with wild Oryza species. Comparative genomics and biochemical studies using wild rice species from the AA genome lineage, including Oryza barthii, Oryza glumaepatula, Oryza meridionalis and the progenitor of Asian cultivated rice Oryza rufipogon indicate that gene clustering for biosynthesis of momilactones and phytocassanes had already been accomplished before the domestication of rice. Similar studies using the species Oryza punctata from the BB genome lineage, the distant FF genome lineage species Oryza brachyantha and an outgroup species Leersia perrieri suggest that the phytocassane biosynthetic gene cluster was present in the common ancestor of the Oryza species despite the different locations, directions and numbers of their member genes. However, the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster evolved within Oryza before the divergence of the BB genome via assembly of ancestral genes.
27242822	Overexpression of Thiamin Biosynthesis Genes in Rice Increases Leaf and Unpolished Grain Thiamin Content But Not Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), also known as vitamin B1, serves as an enzymatic cofactor in glucose metabolism, the Krebs cycle, and branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in all living organisms. Unlike plants and microorganisms, humans are not able to synthesize ThDP de novo and must obtain it from their diet. Staple crops such as rice are poor sources of thiamin. Hence, populations that mainly consume rice commonly suffer thiamin deficiency. In addition to thiamin's nutritional function, studies in rice have shown that some thiamin biosynthesis genes are involved in resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae, which causes a serious disease in rice fields. This study shows that overexpression of two thiamin biosynthesis genes, 4-methyl-5-β-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate synthase and 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase, involved in the first steps of the thiazole and pyrimidine synthesis branches, respectively, increased thiamin content up to fivefold in unpolished seeds that retain the bran. However, thiamin levels in polished seeds with removed bran were similar to those found in polished control seeds. Plants with higher accumulation of thiamin did not show enhanced resistance to X. oryzae. These results indicate that stacking of two traits can enhance thiamin accumulation in rice unpolished grain. We discuss potential roadblocks that prevent thiamin accumulation in the endosperm.
27436950	Overexpression of BSR1 confers broad-spectrum resistance against two bacterial diseases and two major fungal diseases in rice.	2016	Breed Sci	Broad-spectrum disease resistance against two or more types of pathogen species is desirable for crop improvement. In rice, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal bacteria of rice leaf blight, and Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast, are two of the most devastating pathogens. We identified the rice BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1) gene for a BIK1-like receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase using the FOX hunting system, and demonstrated that BSR1-overexpressing (OX) rice showed strong resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xoo and the fungal pathogen, M. oryzae. Here, we report that BSR1-OX rice showed extended resistance against two other different races of Xoo, and to at least one other race of M. oryzae. In addition, the rice showed resistance to another bacterial species, Burkholderia glumae, which causes bacterial seedling rot and bacterial grain rot, and to Cochliobolus miyabeanus, another fungal species causing brown spot. Furthermore, BSR1-OX rice showed slight resistance to rice stripe disease, a major viral disease caused by rice stripe virus. Thus, we demonstrated that BSR1-OX rice shows remarkable broad-spectrum resistance to at least two major bacterial species and two major fungal species, and slight resistance to one viral pathogen.
27241493	The RICE MINUTE-LIKE1 (RML1) gene, encoding a ribosomal large subunit protein L3B, regulates leaf morphology and plant architecture in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Mutations of ribosomal proteins (RPs) are known to cause developmental abnormalities in yeast, mammals, and dicotyledonous plants; however, their effects have not been studied in rice. Here, we identifiy a ribosomal biogenesis mutant, rice minute-like1 (rml1) that displays a minute phenotype as evidenced by retarded growth and defects in the vascular system. We determine that RML1 encodes a ribosome large subunit protein 3B (RPL3B) in rice by means of map-based cloning and genetic complementation. RPL3B is abundantly expressed in all the tissues, whereas RPL3A, another RPL3 gene family member, is expressed at low levels. Notably, the expression level of RPL3A in the rml1 mutant is similar to that in the wild-type, suggesting that RPL3A provides no functional compensation for RPL3B in rml1 plants. Ribosomal profiles show that mutation of RPL3B leads to a significant reduction in free 60S ribosomal subunits and polysomes, indicating a ribosomal insufficiency in the rml1 mutant. Our results demonstrate that the ribosomal protein gene RPL3B is required for maintaining normal leaf morphology and plant architecture in rice through its regulation of ribosome biogenesis.
27242816	Calcium Supplementation Improves Na(+)/K(+) Ratio, Antioxidant Defense and Glyoxalase Systems in Salt-Stressed Rice Seedlings.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The present study investigates the regulatory role of exogenous calcium (Ca) in developing salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings. Hydroponically grown 13-day-old rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. BRRI dhan47) seedlings were exposed to 200 mM NaCl alone and combined with 2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA, a Ca scavenger) for 3 days. The salt stress caused growth inhibition, chlorosis and water shortage in the rice seedlings. The salt-induced stress disrupted ion homeostasis through Na(+) influx and K(+) efflux, and decreased other mineral nutrient uptake. Salt stress caused oxidative stress in seedlings through lipid peroxidation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and methylglyoxal (MG) formation. The salt-stressed seedlings supplemented with exogenous Ca recovered from water loss, chlorosis and growth inhibition. Calcium supplementation in the salt-stressed rice seedlings improved ion homeostasis by inhibition of Na(+) influx and K(+) leakage. Exogenous Ca also improved ROS and MG detoxification by improving the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems, respectively. On the other hand, applying EGTA along with salt and Ca again negatively affected the seedlings as EGTA negated Ca activity. It confirms that, the positive responses in salt-stressed rice seedlings to exogenous Ca were for Ca mediated improvement of ion homeostasis, antioxidant defense and glyoxalase system.
27258255	The Transcription Factor OsWRKY45 Negatively Modulates the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	WRKY transcription factors play a central role not only in plant growth and development but also in plant stress responses. However, the role of WRKY transcription factors in herbivore-induced plant defenses and their underlying mechanisms, especially in rice, remains largely unclear. Here, we cloned a rice WRKY gene OsWRKY45, whose expression was induced by mechanical wounding, by infestation of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and by treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA). The antisense expression of OsWRKY45 (as-wrky) enhanced BPH-induced levels of H₂O₂ and ethylene, reduced feeding and oviposition preference as well as the survival rate of BPH, and delayed the development of BPH nymphs. Consistently, lower population densities of BPH on as-wrky lines, compared to those on wild-type (WT) plants, were observed in field experiments. On the other hand, as-wrky lines in the field had lower susceptibility to sheath blight (caused by Rhizoctonia solani) but higher susceptibility to rice blast (caused by Magnaporthe oryzae) than did WT plants. These findings suggest that OsWRKY45 plays important but contrasting roles in regulating the resistance of rice to pathogens and herbivores, and attention should be paid if OsWRKY45 is used to develop disease or herbivore-resistant rice.
27167516	Development of Cytoplasmic Male Sterile IR24 and IR64 Using CW-CMS/Rf17 System.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: A wild-abortive-type (WA) cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has been almost exclusively used for breeding three-line hybrid rice. Many indica cultivars are known to carry restorer genes for WA-CMS lines and cannot be used as maintainer lines. Especially elite indica cultivars IR24 and IR64 are known to be restorer lines for WA-CMS lines, and are used as male parents for hybrid seed production. If we develop CMS IR24 and CMS IR64, the combination of F1 pairs in hybrid rice breeding programs will be greatly broadened.

FINDINGS: For production of CMS lines and restorer lines of IR24 and IR64, we employed Chinese wild rice (CW)-type CMS/Restorer of fertility 17 (Rf17) system, in which fertility is restored by a single nuclear gene, Rf17. Successive backcrossing and marker-assisted selection of Rf17 succeeded to produce completely male sterile CMS lines and fully restored restorer lines of IR24 and IR64. CW-cytoplasm did not affect agronomic characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS: Since IR64 is one of the most popular mega-varieties and used for breeding of many modern varieties, the CW-CMS line of IR64 will be useful for hybrid rice breeding.
27241276	N-glycan containing a core α1,3-fucose residue is required for basipetal auxin transport and gravitropic response in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	New Phytol	In plants, α1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT) catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose to asparagine-linked GlcNAc of the N-glycan core in the medial Golgi. To explore the physiological significance of this processing, we isolated two Oryza sativa (rice) mutants (fuct-1 and fuct-2) with loss of FucT function. Biochemical analyses of the N-glycan structure confirmed that α1,3-fucose is missing from the N-glycans of allelic fuct-1 and fuct-2. Compared with the wild-type cv Kitaake, fuct-1 displayed a larger tiller angle, shorter internode and panicle lengths, and decreased grain filling as well as an increase in chalky grains with abnormal shape. The mutant allele fuct-2 gave rise to similar developmental abnormalities, although they were milder than those of fuct-1. Restoration of a normal tiller angle in fuct-1 by complementation demonstrated that the phenotype is caused by the loss of FucT function. Both fuct-1 and fuct-2 plants exhibited reduced gravitropic responses. Expression of the genes involved in tiller and leaf angle control was also affected in the mutants. We demonstrate that reduced basipetal auxin transport and low auxin accumulation at the base of the shoot in fuct-1 account for both the reduced gravitropic response and the increased tiller angle.
27246096	Defective Pollen Wall 2 (DPW2) Encodes an Acyl Transferase Required for Rice Pollen Development.	2017	Plant Physiol	Aliphatic and aromatic lipids are both essential structural components of the plant cuticle, an important interface between the plant and environment. Although cross links between aromatic and aliphatic or other moieties are known to be associated with the formation of leaf cutin and root and seed suberin, the contribution of aromatic lipids to the biosynthesis of anther cuticles and pollen walls remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) male sterile mutant, defective pollen wall 2 (dpw2), which showed an abnormal anther cuticle, a defective pollen wall, and complete male sterility. Compared with the wild type, dpw2 anthers have increased amounts of cutin and waxes and decreased levels of lipidic and phenolic compounds. DPW2 encodes a cytoplasmically localized BAHD acyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrated that recombinant DPW2 specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acid moieties, using ω-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors. Thus, The cytoplasmic hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:ω-hydroxy fatty acid transferase DPW2 plays a fundamental role in male reproduction via the biosynthesis of key components of the anther cuticle and pollen wall.
27242827	The qTSN4 Effect on Flag Leaf Size, Photosynthesis and Panicle Size, Benefits to Plant Grain Production in Rice, Depending on Light Availability.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Increasing rice yield potential is essential to secure world food supply. The quantitative trait locus qTSN4 was reported to achieve yield increases by enhancing both source and sink capacity. Three greenhouse experiments and one field experiment in the Philippines were conducted to study near-isogenic lines (NILs) in two genetic backgrounds, subjected to treatments with restricted light resources through shading (greenhouse) or population density (field and greenhouse). A consistent promotion of flag leaf width, leaf area and panicle size in terms of spikelet number was observed in the presence of qTSN4, regardless of environment. However, grain production per plant was enhanced only in one greenhouse experiment. An in-depth study demonstrated that increased flag leaf size in the presence of qTSN4 was associated with increased photosynthetic rates, along with lower SLA and greater N content per leaf weight and per area. This was emphasized under low light situation as the qTSN4-NILs did not express shade acclimation traits in contrast with the recipient varieties. The authors conclude that qTSN4 is a promising subject for further physiological studies, particularly under limited radiation. However, the QTL alone may not be a reliable source of increased yield potential because its effects at the plant and population scale are prone to genotype × environment interactions and the increased panicle size is compensated by the adaptive plasticity of other morphological traits.
27242837	Identification of Striga hermonthica-Resistant Upland Rice Varieties in Sudan and Their Resistance Phenotypes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice has become a major staple cereal in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, upland rice cultivation is expanding particularly in rainfed areas where the root parasitic weed Striga hermonthica, a major constraint to cereal production, is endemic. Laboratory, pot, and semi-controlled open air experiments were performed to evaluate resistance of selected rice varieties in Sudan to a resident S. hermonthica population. In the laboratory, 27 varieties were screened for post-attachment resistance using the rhizotron technique. Varieties displaying high post-attachment resistance, Umgar, NERICA5, and NERICA13 together with NERICA4, NERICA18, and Nipponbare, a lowland rice variety, were further evaluated for performance and Striga resistance in pot and semi-controlled open air experiments and for germination inducing activity in a laboratory. In addition, comparative studies on reaction of Umgar, Kosti1 and Kosti2, released varieties for commercial production in Sudan, to the parasite were performed in two pot experiments. In the pot experiments Umgar and NERICA5, consistently, sustained the lowest Striga emergence (<2.2 Striga plants per pot), while NERICA13 and NERICA4 supported 1.8-5.7 and 8.7-16.4 Striga plants per pot, respectively. In an artificially Striga-infested field, number of emergent Striga plants per 10 rice hills, at harvest, was 2.0, 2.0, 4.8, 13.5, 13.3, and 18.3 on Umgar, NERICA5, NERICA13, NERICA4, NERICA18, and Nipponbare, respectively. Striga had no adverse effects on total above-ground parts and panicle dry weight in Umgar and NERICA5. Germination-inducing activity of root exudates, at 14 days after sowing onward, was markedly lower for Umgar than for NERICA5, NERICA13, NERICA4, and NERICA18. Based on these findings, Umgar has both pre and post-attachment resistance to a resident Striga population in Sudan. Kosti1 and Kosti2 did not exhibit Striga-resistance at the same level as Umgar. Further the resistance of NERICA5, a variety reported to be endowed with a broad spectrum resistance to Striga species and ecotypes, at least to one resident Striga population in Sudan was clearly indicated.
27195813	Quantitative proteomic analysis of two different rice varieties reveals that drought tolerance is correlated with reduced abundance of photosynthetic machinery and increased abundance of ClpD1 protease.	2016	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Rice is the major staple food for more than half of world's population. As global climate changes, we are observing more floods, droughts and severe heat waves. Two rice cultivars with contrasting genetic backgrounds and levels of tolerance to drought, Nipponbare and IAC1131, were used in this study. Four-week-old seedlings of both cultivars were grown in large soil volumes and then exposed to moderate and extreme drought for 7days, followed by 3days of re-watering. Mature leaves were harvested from plants from each treatment for protein extraction and subsequent shotgun proteomic analysis, with validation of selected proteins by western blotting. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of differentially expressed proteins provide insights into the metabolic pathways that are involved in drought stress resistance. Our data indicate that IAC1131 appears to be better able to cope with stressful conditions by upregulating a suite of stress and defence response related proteins. Nipponbare, in contrast, lacks the range of stress responses shown by the more stress tolerant variety, and responds to drought stress by initiating a partial shutdown of chlorophyll biosynthesis in an apparent attempt to preserve resources.

SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, two rice genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance were exposed to soil water deficits, and proteomic changes were observed in mature leaf laminae. Plants were well watered and then switched to conditions of either moderate drought or extreme drought followed by three days of recovery. Proteins were identified and quantified using both label-free and Tandem Mass Tag multiplexing approaches. Several biochemical pathways were significantly altered in response to water deficit. Most notably, the up-regulation of ClpD1 protease responded strongly in the drought-tolerant landrace; this protein is typically involved in heat and osmotic stress response. In contrast, porphyrin and chlorophyll biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated, indicating suppression of the photosynthetic machinery.
27436953	Development and evaluation of rice giant embryo mutants for high oil content originated from a high-yielding cultivar 'Mizuhochikara'.	2016	Breed Sci	Rice bran oil is a byproduct of the milling of rice (Oryza sativa L.). It offers various health benefits and has a beneficial fatty acid composition. To increase the amount of rice bran as a sink for triacylglycerol (TAG), we developed and characterized new breeding materials with giant embryos. To induce mutants, we treated fertilized egg cells of the high-yielding cultivar 'Mizuhochikara' with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). By screening M2 seeds, we isolated four giant embryo mutant lines. Genetic analysis revealed that the causative loci in lines MGE12 and MGE13 were allelic to giant embryo (ge) on chromosome 7, and had base changes in the causal gene Os07g0603700. On the other hand, the causative loci in lines MGE8 and MGE14 were not allelic to ge, and both were newly mapped on chromosome 3. The TAG contents of all four mutant lines increased relative to their wild type, 'Mizuhochikara'. MGE13 was agronomically similar to 'Mizuhochikara' and would be useful for breeding for improved oil content.
27142249	Self-assembly of MPG1, a hydrophobin protein from the rice blast fungus that forms functional amyloid coatings, occurs by a surface-driven mechanism.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice blast is a devastating disease of rice caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and can result in loss of a third of the annual global rice harvest. Two hydrophobin proteins, MPG1 and MHP1, are highly expressed during rice blast infections. These hydrophobins have been suggested to facilitate fungal spore adhesion and to direct the action of the enzyme cutinase 2, resulting in penetration of the plant host. Therefore a mechanistic understanding of the self-assembly properties of these hydrophobins and their interaction with cutinase 2 is crucial for the development of novel antifungals. Here we report details of a study of the structure, assembly and interactions of these proteins. We demonstrate that, in vitro, MPG1 assembles spontaneously into amyloid structures while MHP1 forms a non-fibrillar film. The assembly of MPG1 only occurs at a hydrophobic:hydrophilic interface and can be modulated by MHP1 and other factors. We further show that MPG1 assemblies can much more effectively retain cutinase 2 activity on a surface after co-incubation and extensive washing compared with other protein coatings. The assembly and interactions of MPG1 and MHP1 at hydrophobic surfaces thereby provide the basis for a possible mechanism by which the fungus can develop appropriately at the infection interface.
27218863	γ-Aminobutyric acid addition alleviates ammonium toxicity by limiting ammonium accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings.	2016	Physiol Plant	Excessive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has increased ammonium (NH4+ ) accumulation in many paddy soils to levels that reduce rice vegetative biomass and yield. Based on studies of NH4+ toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa, Nanjing 44) seedlings cultured in agar medium, we found that NH4+ concentrations above 0.75 mM inhibited the growth of rice and caused NH4+ accumulation in both shoots and roots. Use of excessive NH4+ also induced rhizosphere acidification and inhibited the absorption of K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn in rice seedlings. Under excessive NH4+ conditions, exogenous γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) treatment limited NH4+ accumulation in rice seedlings, reduced NH4+ toxicity symptoms and promoted plant growth. GABA addition also reduced rhizosphere acidification and alleviated the inhibition of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn absorption caused by excessive NH4+ . Furthermore, we found that the activity of glutamine synthetase/NADH-glutamate synthase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2/NADH-GOGAT; EC1.4.1.14) in root increased gradually as the NH4+ concentration increased. However, when the concentration of NH4+ is more than 3 mM, GABA treatment inhibited NH4+ -induced increases in GS/NADH-GOGAT activity. The inhibition of ammonium assimilation may restore the elongation of seminal rice roots repressed by high NH4+ . These results suggest that mitigation of ammonium accumulation and assimilation is essential for GABA-dependent alleviation of ammonium toxicity in rice seedlings.
27165035	Time-resolved pathogenic gene expression analysis of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant-pathogen interactions at early stages of infection are important to the fate of interaction. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight, which is a devastating disease in rice. Although in vivo and in vitro systems have been developed to study rice-Xoo interactions, both systems have limitations. The resistance mechanisms in rice can be better studied by the in vivo approach, whereas the in vitro systems are suitable for pathogenicity studies on Xoo. The current in vitro system uses minimal medium to activate the pathogenic signal (expression of pathogenicity-related genes) of Xoo, but lacks rice-derived factors needed for Xoo activation. This fact emphasizes the need of developing a new in vitro system that allow for an easy control of both pathogenic activation and for the experiment itself.

RESULTS: We employed an in vitro system that can activate pathogenicity-related genes in Xoo using rice leaf extract (RLX) and combined the in vitro assay with RNA-Seq to analyze the time-resolved genome-wide gene expression of Xoo. RNA-Seq was performed with samples from seven different time points within 1 h post-RLX treatment and the expression of up- or downregulated genes in RNA-Seq was validated by qRT-PCR. Global analysis of gene expression and regulation revealed the most dramatic changes in functional categories of genes related to inorganic ion transport and metabolism, and cell motility. Expression of many pathogenicity-related genes was induced within 15 min upon contact with RLX. hrpG and hrpX expression reached the maximum level within 10 and 15 min, respectively. Chemotaxis and flagella biosynthesis-related genes and cyclic-di-GMP controlling genes were downregulated for 10 min and were then upregulated. Genes related to inorganic ion uptake were upregulated within 5 min. We introduced a non-linear regression fit to generate continuous time-resolved gene expression levels and tested the essentiality of the transcriptionally upregulated genes by a pathogenicity assay of lesion length using single-gene knock-out Xoo strains.

CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro system combined with RNA-Seq generated a genome-wide time-resolved pathogenic gene expression profile within 1 h of initial rice-Xoo interactions, demonstrating the expression order and interaction dependency of pathogenic genes. This combined system can be used as a novel tool to study the initial interactions between rice and Xoo during bacterial blight progression.
27164982	Pyramiding of drought yield QTLs into a high quality Malaysian rice cultivar MRQ74 improves yield under reproductive stage drought.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: With the objective of improving the grain yield (GY) of the Malaysian high quality rice cultivar MRQ74 under reproductive stage drought stress (RS), three drought yield QTLs, viz. qDTY 2.2, qDTY 3.1 , and qDTY 12.1 were pyramided by marker assisted breeding (MAB). Foreground selection using QTL specific markers, recombinant selection using flanking markers, and background selections were performed in every generation. BC1F3 derived pyramided lines (PLs) with different combinations of qDTY 2.2, qDTY 3.1 , and qDTY 12.1 were evaluated under both RS and non-stress (NS) during the dry season (DS) of 2013 and 2014 at IRRI.

RESULTS: The GY reductions in RS trials compared to NS trials ranged from 79 to 99 %. Plant height (PH) was reduced and days to flowering (DTF) was delayed under RS. Eleven BC1F5 MRQ74 PLs with yield advantages of 1009 to 3473 kg ha(-1) under RS and with yields equivalent to MRQ74 under NS trials were identified as promising drought tolerance PLs. Five best PLs, IR 98010-126-708-1-4, IR 98010-126-708-1-3, IR 98010-126-708-1-5, IR 99616-44-94-1-1, and IR 99616-44-94-1-2 with a yield advantage of more than 1000 kg ha(-1) under RS and with yield potential equivalent to that of MRQ74 under NS were selected. The effect of three drought grain yield QTLs under RS in MRQ74 was validated. Under NS, PLs with two qDTY combinations (qDTY 2.2 + qDTY 12.1 ) performed better than PLs with other qDTY combinations, indicating the presence of a positive interaction between qDTY 2.2 and qDTY 12.1 in the MRQ74 background.

CONCLUSION: Drought tolerant MRQ74 PLs with a yield advantage of more than 1000 kg ha(-1) under RS were developed. Differential yield advantages of different combinations of the qDTYs indicate a differential synergistic relationship among qDTYs.
27223617	Loss of GltB Inhibits Biofilm Formation and Biocontrol Efficiency of Bacillus subtilis Bs916 by Altering the Production of γ-Polyglutamate and Three Lipopeptides.	2016	PLoS One	AIMS: This study examined the contribution of GltB on biofilm formation and biocontrol efficiency of B. subtilis Bs916.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The gltB gene was identified through a biofilm phenotype screen and a bioinformatics analysis of serious biofilm formation defects, and then a gltB single knockout mutant was constructed using homologous recombination. This mutant demonstrated severe deficits in biofilm formation and colonisation along with significantly altered production ofγ-polyglutamate (γ-PGA) and three lipopeptide antibiotics (LPs) as measured by a transcriptional analysis of both the wild type B. subtilis Bs916 and the gltB mutant. Consequently, the mutant strain retained almost no antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and exhibited decreased biocontrol efficiency against rice sheath blight. Very few gltB mutant cells colonised the rice stem, and they exhibited no significant nutrient chemotaxis compared to the wild type B. subtilis Bs916. The mechanism underlying these deficits in the gltB mutant appears to be decreased significantly in production of γ-PGA and a reduction in the production of both bacillomycin L and fengycin. Biofilm restoration of gltB mutant by additionγ-PGA in the EM medium demonstrated that biofilm formation was able to restore significantly at 20 g/L.

CONCLUSIONS: GltB regulates biofilm formation by altering the production ofγ-PGA, the LPs bacillomycin L and fengcin and influences bacterial colonisation on the rice stem, which consequently leads to poor biocontrol efficiency against rice sheath blight.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This is the first report of a key regulatory protein (GltB) that is involved in biofilm regulation and its regulation mechanism and biocontrol efficiency by B. subtilis.
27145723	Heat tolerance in a wild Oryza species is attributed to maintenance of Rubisco activation by a thermally stable Rubisco activase ortholog.	2016	New Phytol	The mechanistic basis of tolerance to heat stress was investigated in Oryza sativa and two wild rice species, Oryza meridionalis and Oryza australiensis. The wild relatives are endemic to the hot, arid Australian savannah. Leaf elongation rates and gas exchange were measured during short periods of supra-optimal heat, revealing species differences. The Rubisco activase (RCA) gene from each species was sequenced. Using expressed recombinant RCA and leaf-extracted RCA, the kinetic properties of the two isoforms were studied under high temperatures. Leaf elongation was undiminished at 45°C in O. australiensis. The net photosynthetic rate was almost 50% slower in O. sativa at 45°C than at 28°C, while in O. australiensis it was unaffected. Oryza meridionalis exhibited intermediate heat tolerance. Based on previous reports that RCA is heat-labile, the Rubisco activation state was measured. It correlated positively with leaf elongation rates across all three species and four periods of exposure to 45°C. Sequence analysis revealed numerous polymorphisms in the RCA amino acid sequence from O. australiensis. The O. australiensis RCA enzyme was thermally stable up to 42°C, contrasting with RCA from O. sativa, which was inhibited at 36°C. We attribute heat tolerance in the wild species to thermal stability of RCA, enabling Rubisco to remain active.
27160855	A saturated SNP linkage map for the orange wheat blossom midge resistance gene Sm1.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: SNP markers were developed for the OWBM resistance gene Sm1 that will be useful for MAS. The wheat Sm1 region is collinear with an inverted syntenic interval in B. distachyon. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana Géhin) is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many growing regions. Sm1 is the only described OWBM resistance gene and is the foundation of managing OWBM through host genetics. Sm1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm1 region. The present study mapped Sm1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage. Seven SNPs were tested on a collection of wheat lines known to carry Sm1 and not to carry Sm1. Sm1-flanking SNPs were identified that were useful for predicting the presence or absence of Sm1 based upon haplotype. These SNPs will be a major improvement for MAS of Sm1 in wheat breeding programs.
27136273	Metal Ions Play an Essential Catalytic Role in the Mechanism of Ketol-Acid Reductoisomerase.	2016	Chemistry	Ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a Mg(2+) -dependent enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway. It catalyses a complex two-part reaction: an alkyl migration followed by a NADPH-dependent reduction. Both reactions occur within the one active site, but in particular, the mechanism of the isomerisation step is poorly understood. Here, using a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques, the reaction mechanisms of both Escherichia coli and rice KARI have been investigated. We propose a conserved mechanism of catalysis, whereby a hydroxide, bridging the two Mg(2+) ions in the active site, initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton from the C2 alcohol group of the substrate. While the μ-hydroxide-bridged dimetallic centre is pre-assembled in the bacterial enzyme, in plant KARI substrate binding leads to a reduction of the metal-metal distance with the concomitant formation of a hydroxide bridge. Only Mg(2+) is capable of promoting the isomerisation reaction, likely to be due to non-competent substrate binding in the presence of other metal ions.
27198693	Comparative metabolomic analysis reveals a reactive oxygen species-dominated dynamic model underlying chilling environment adaptation and tolerance in rice.	2016	New Phytol	Cold, a major environmental stress for plants, has been studied intensively for decades. Its response system has been revealed, especially at the transcriptional level. The mechanisms underlying recovery growth and environmental adaptation, however, remain unknown. Taking advantage of a naturally existing system, two subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) with significant divergence in chilling tolerance, we analyzed representative japonica and indica varieties, Nipponbare and 93-11, using comparative metabolomic analysis at six time points covering chilling treatment and recovery. In total, 223 known metabolites were detected. During chilling treatment, significant biochemical changes were centered on antioxidation. During recovery, a wide-ranging chilling response was observed. Large-scale amino acid accumulation occurred, consistent with the appearance of chilling injury. At the mid-treatment stage, the accumulation of antioxidation-related compounds appeared earlier in Nipponbare than in 93-11, consistent with the higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in japonica vs indica varieties. A significant contribution of ROS-mediated gene regulation, rather than the C-repeat binding factor/dehydration-responsive-element binding factor (CBF/DREB) regulon, to the more vigorous transcriptional stress response in Nipponbare was revealed by RNA-seq. Accordingly, during recovery, the induction of stress-tolerant-related metabolites was more active in the chilling-tolerant variety Nipponbare. Senescence-related compounds accumulated only in the chilling-sensitive variety 93-11. Our study uncovers the dynamic metabolic models underlying chilling response and recovery, and reveals a ROS-dominated rice adaptation mechanism to low-temperature environments.
27304219	Transcriptome Sequencing and Analysis for Culm Elongation of the World's Largest Bamboo (Dendrocalamus sinicus).	2016	PLoS One	Dendrocalamus sinicus is the world's largest bamboo species with strong woody culms, and known for its fast-growing culms. As an economic bamboo species, it was popularized for multi-functional applications including furniture, construction, and industrial paper pulp. To comprehensively elucidate the molecular processes involved in its culm elongation, Illumina paired-end sequencing was conducted. About 65.08 million high-quality reads were produced, and assembled into 81,744 unigenes with an average length of 723 bp. A total of 64,338 (79%) unigenes were annotated for their functions, of which, 56,587 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 35,262 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. Also, 42,508 and 21,009 annotated unigenes were allocated to gene ontology (GO) categories and clusters of orthologous groups (COG), respectively. By searching against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database (KEGG), 33,920 unigenes were assigned to 128 KEGG pathways. Meanwhile, 8,553 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 81,534 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified, respectively. Additionally, 388 transcripts encoding lignin biosynthesis were detected, among which, 27 transcripts encoding Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) specifically expressed in D. sinicus when compared to other bamboo species and rice. The phylogenetic relationship between D. sinicus and other plants was analyzed, suggesting functional diversity of HCT unigenes in D. sinicus. We conjectured that HCT might lead to the high lignin content and giant culm. Given that the leaves are not yet formed and culm is covered with sheaths during culm elongation, the existence of photosynthesis of bamboo culm is usually neglected. Surprisedly, 109 transcripts encoding photosynthesis were identified, including photosystem I and II, cytochrome b6/f complex, photosynthetic electron transport and F-type ATPase, and 24 transcripts were characterized as antenna proteins that regarded as the main tool for capturing light of plants, implying stem photosynthesis plays a key role during culm elongation due to the unavailability of its leaf. By real-time quantitative PCR, the expression level of 6 unigenes was detected. The results showed the expression level of all genes accorded with the transcriptome data, which confirm the reliability of the transcriptome data. As we know, this is the first study underline the D. sinicus transcriptome, which will deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of culm development. The results may help variety improvement and resource utilization of bamboos.
27286833	Interdependency of Reactive Oxygen Species generating and scavenging system in salt sensitive and salt tolerant cultivars of rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Salinity stress is a major constrain in the global rice production and hence serious efforts are being undertaken towards deciphering its remedial strategies. The comparative analysis of differential response of salt sensitive and salt tolerant lines is a judicious approach to obtain essential clues towards understanding the acquisition of salinity tolerance in rice plants. However, adaptation to salt stress is a fairly complex process and operates through different mechanisms. Among various mechanisms involved, the reactive oxygen species mediated salinity tolerance is believed to be critical as it evokes cascade of responses related to stress tolerance. In this background, the present paper for the first time evaluates the ROS generating and the scavenging system in tandem in both salt sensitive and salt tolerant cultivars of rice for getting better insight into salinity stress adaptation.

RESULTS: Comparative analysis of ROS indicates the higher level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lower level of superoxide ions (O(2-)) in the salt tolerant as compared to salt sensitive cultivars. Specific activity of ROS generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase was also found to be more in the tolerant cultivars. Further, activities of various enzymes involved in enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant defence system were mostly higher in tolerant cultivars. The transcript level analysis of antioxidant enzymes were in alignment with the enzymatic activity. Other stress markers like proline were observed to be higher in tolerant varieties whereas, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents and chlorophyll content were estimated to be more in sensitive.

CONCLUSION: The present study showed significant differences in the level of ROS production and antioxidant enzymes activities among sensitive and tolerant cultivars, suggesting their possible role in providing natural salt tolerance to selected cultivars of rice. Our study demonstrates that the cellular machinery for ROS production and scavenging system works in an interdependent manner to offer better salt stress adaptation in rice. The present work further highlights that the elevated level of H2O2 which is considered as a key determinant for conferring salt stress tolerance to rice might have originated through an alternative route of photocatalytic activity of chlorophyll.
27330561	The sorghum SWEET gene family: stem sucrose accumulation as revealed through transcriptome profiling.	2016	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: SWEET is a newly identified family of sugar transporters. Although SWEET transporters have been characterized by using Arabidopsis and rice, very little knowledge of sucrose accumulation in the stem region is available, as these model plants accumulate little sucrose in their stems. To elucidate the expression of key SWEET genes involved in sucrose accumulation of sorghum, we performed transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq, categorization using phylogenetic trees, analysis of chromosomal synteny, and comparison of amino acid sequences between SIL-05 (a sweet sorghum) and BTx623 (a grain sorghum).

RESULTS: We identified 23 SWEET genes in the sorghum genome. In the leaf, SbSWEET8-1 was highly expressed and was grouped in the same clade as AtSWEET11 and AtSWEET12 that play a role in the efflux of photosynthesized sucrose. The key genes in sucrose synthesis (SPS3) and that in another step of sugar transport (SbSUT1 and SbSUT2) were also highly expressed, suggesting that sucrose is newly synthesized and actively exported from the leaf. In the stem, SbSWEET4-3 was uniquely highly expressed. SbSWEET4-1, SbSWEET4-2, and SbSWEET4-3 were categorized into the same clade, but their tissue specificities were different, suggesting that SbSWEET4-3 is a sugar transporter with specific roles in the stem. We found a putative SWEET4-3 ortholog in the corresponding region of the maize chromosome, but not the rice chromosome, suggesting that SbSWEET4-3 was copied after the branching of sorghum and maize from rice. In the panicle from the heading through to 36 days afterward, SbSWEET2-1 and SbSWEET7-1 were expressed and grouped in the same clade as rice OsSWEET11/Xa13 that is essential for seed development. SbSWEET9-3 was highly expressed in the panicle only just after heading and was grouped into the same clade as AtSWEET8/RPG1 that is essential for pollen viability. Five of 23 SWEET genes had SNPs that caused nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions between SIL-05 and BTx623.

CONCLUSIONS: We determined the key SWEET genes for technological improvement of sorghum in the production of biofuels: SbSWEET8-1 for efflux of sucrose from the leaf; SbSWEET4-3 for unloading sucrose from the phloem in the stem; SbSWEET2-1 and SbSWEET7-1 for seed development; SbSWEET9-3 for pollen nutrition.
27313595	Functional Studies of Heading Date-Related Gene TaPRR73, a Paralog of Ppd1 in Common Wheat.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Photoperiod response-related genes play a crucial role in duration of the plant growth. In this study, we focused on TaPRR73, a paralog of "Green Revolution" gene Ppd1 (TaPRR37). We found that overexpression of the truncated TaPRR73 form lacking part of the N-terminal PR domain in transgenic rice promoted heading under long day conditions. Association analysis in common wheat verified that TaPRR73 was an important agronomic photoperiod response gene that significantly affected heading date and plant height; expression analysis proved that specific alleles of TaPRR73-A1 had highly expressed levels in earlier heading lines; the distribution of haplotypes indicated that one of these alleles had been selected in breeding programs. Our results demonstrated that TaPRR73 contributed to regulation of heading date in wheat and could be useful in wheat breeding and in broadening adaptation of the crop to new regions.
27320861	N-glycan transition of the early developmental stage in Oryza sativa.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	N-Glycosylation is one of the post-translational modifications. In animals, N-glycans linked to proteins function in cell-cell recognition, sorting, transport, and other biological phenomena. However, in plants, N-glycan-mediated biological functions remain obscure. In a previous study, we showed that the main type of N-glycan transition is from the paucimannosidic to complex type before and after germination in Oryza sativa, suggesting that transitions of N-glycan, including those of glycoproteins and glycosyltransferases, are closely associated with plant growth. To further elucidate the relationship between N-glycan structure and plant growth, we analyzed the structures of N-glycans expressed in O. sativa seedlings grown under light conditions and performed comparative analyses of the structures in the shoot and root. The analyses show that fundamental N-glycan structures are common to the shoot and root, whereas paucimannosidic-type N-glycans dramatically decreased in the root grown under light conditions. Further, to investigate the effects of light on N-glycan structures in O. sativa seedlings, we analyzed N-glycan structures in O. sativa seedlings grown in the dark. Understandably, N-glycan expression in the root was almost unaffected by light. However, despite a marked difference in phenotype, N-glycan expression in the shoot was also unaffected by light. This result suggests that the shoot and root of O. sativa have different glycoproteins and distinct N-glycan synthetic systems. Thus, we propose that the N-glycan synthetic system of the O. sativa shoot is almost unaffected by light conditions and that many photosynthesis-related proteins are not modified by N-glycans.
27323767	Pyramiding of two rice bacterial blight resistance genes, Xa3 and Xa4, and a closely linked cold-tolerance QTL on chromosome 11.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We fine mapped the Xa4 locus and developed a pyramided rice line containing Xa3 and Xa4 R - alleles and a cold-tolerance QTL. This line will be valuable in rice breeding. Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a destructive disease of cultivated rice. Pyramiding BB resistance genes is an essential approach for increasing the resistance level of rice varieties. We selected an advanced backcross recombinant inbred line 132 (ABL132) from the BC3F7 population derived from a cross between cultivars Junam and IR72 by K3a inoculation and constructed the mapping population (BC4F6) to locate the Xa4 locus. The Xa4 locus was found to be delimited within a 60-kb interval between InDel markers InDel1 and InDel2 and tightly linked with the Xa3 gene on chromosome 11. After cold (4 °C) treatment, ABL132 with introgressions of IR72 in chromosome 11 showed lower survival rate, chlorophyll content, and relative water content compared to Junam. Genetic analysis showed that the cold stress-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) qCT11 was located in a 1.3-Mb interval close to the Xa4 locus. One line, ABL132-36, containing the Xa3 resistance allele from Junam, the Xa4 resistance allele from IR72, and the cold-tolerance QTL from Junam (qCT11), was developed from a BC4F6 population of 250 plants. This is the first report on the pyramiding of Xa3 and Xa4 genes with a cold-tolerance QTL. This region could provide a potential tool for improving resistance against BB and low-temperature stress in rice-breeding programs.
27357959	Development of high-lysine rice via endosperm-specific expression of a foreign LYSINE RICH PROTEIN gene.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Lysine (Lys) is considered to be the first limiting essential amino acid in rice. Although there have been extensive efforts to improve the Lys content of rice through traditional breeding and genetic engineering, no satisfactory products have been achieved to date.

RESULTS: We expressed a LYSINE-RICH PROTEIN gene (LRP) from Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC using an endosperm-specific GLUTELIN1 promoter (GT1) in Peiai64S (PA64S), an elite photoperiod-thermo sensitive male sterility (PTSMS) line. The expression of the foreign LRP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The Lys level in the transgenic rice seeds increased more than 30 %, the total amount of other amino acids also increased compared to wild-type. Persistent investigation of amino acids in 3 generations showed that the Lys content was significantly increased in seeds of transgenic rice. Furthermore, Lys content in the hybrid of the transgenic plants also had an approximate 20 % increase compared to hybrid control. At the grain-filling stage, we monitored the transcript abundance of many genes encoding key enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, and the results suggested that reduced amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of amino acids in the transgenic plants. The genetically engineered rice showed unfavorable grain phenotypes compared to wild-type, however, its hybrid displayed little negative effects on grain.

CONCLUSIONS: Endosperm-specific expression of foreign LRP significantly increased the Lys content in the seeds of transgenic plant, and the the Lys increase was stably heritable with 3 generation investigation. The hybrid of the transgenic plants also showed significant increases of Lys content in the seeds. These results indicated that expression of LRP in rice seeds may have promising applications in improving Lys levels in rice.
27357911	RLS3, a protein with AAA+ domain localized in chloroplast, sustains leaf longevity in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Leaf senescence plays an important role in crop developmental processes that dramatically affect crop yield and grain quality. The genetic regulation of leaf senescence is complex, involving many metabolic and signaling pathways. Here, we identified a rapid leaf senescence 3 (rls3) mutant that displayed accelerated leaf senescence, shorter plant height and panicle length, and lower seed set rate than the wild type. Map-based cloning revealed that RLS3 encodes a protein with AAA+ domain, localizing it to chloroplasts. Sequence analysis found that the rls3 gene had a single-nucleotide substitution (G→A) at the splice site of the 10th intron/11th exon, resulting in the cleavage of the first nucleotide in 11th exon and premature termination of RLS3 protein translation. Using transmission electron microscope, the chloroplasts of the rls3 mutant were observed to degrade much faster than those of the wild type. The investigation of the leaf senescence process under dark incubation conditions further revealed that the rls3 mutant displayed rapid leaf senescence. Thus, the RLS3 gene plays key roles in sustaining the normal growth of rice, while loss of function in RLS3 leads to rapid leaf senescence. The identification of RLS3 will be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms involved in leaf senescence in rice.
27419124	Mapping of Novel QTL Regulating Grain Shattering Using Doubled Haploid Population in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Int J Genomics	The critical evolutionary step during domestication of major cereals was elimination of seed shattering because the easy-to-shatter trait in wild relatives results in a severe reduction in yield. In this study, we analyzed the QTLs associated with shattering employing a high-density genetic map in doubled haploid (DH) population of rice (Oryza sativa L.). A genetic linkage map was generated with 217 microsatellite markers spanning 2082.4 cM and covering 12 rice chromosomes with an average interval of 9.6 cM between markers based on 120 DHLs derived from a cross between Cheongcheong indica type cultivar and Nagdong japonica type cultivar. In the QTL analysis, five QTLs pertaining to the breaking tensile strength (BTS) were detected in 2013 and 2015. Two regions of the QTLs related to BTS on chromosome 1 and chromosome 6 were detected. Several important genes are distributed in 1 Mbp region of the QTL on chromosome 6 and they are related to the formation of abscission layer. We decide to name this QTL qSh6 and the candidate genes in the qSh6 region can be employed usefully in further research for cloning.
27352859	SorghumFDB: sorghum functional genomics database with multidimensional network analysis.	2016	Database (Oxford)	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) has excellent agronomic traits and biological properties, such as heat and drought-tolerance. It is a C4 grass and potential bioenergy-producing plant, which makes it an important crop worldwide. With the sorghum genome sequence released, it is essential to establish a sorghum functional genomics data mining platform. We collected genomic data and some functional annotations to construct a sorghum functional genomics database (SorghumFDB). SorghumFDB integrated knowledge of sorghum gene family classifications (transcription regulators/factors, carbohydrate-active enzymes, protein kinases, ubiquitins, cytochrome P450, monolignol biosynthesis related enzymes, R-genes and organelle-genes), detailed gene annotations, miRNA and target gene information, orthologous pairs in the model plants Arabidopsis, rice and maize, gene loci conversions and a genome browser. We further constructed a dynamic network of multidimensional biological relationships, comprised of the co-expression data, protein-protein interactions and miRNA-target pairs. We took effective measures to combine the network, gene set enrichment and motif analyses to determine the key regulators that participate in related metabolic pathways, such as the lignin pathway, which is a major biological process in bioenergy-producing plants.Database URL: http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/sorghum/index.html.
27349470	Large-scale bioinformatic analysis of the regulation of the disease resistance NBS gene family by microRNAs in Poaceae.	None	C R Biol	In the present study, we have screened 71, 713, 525, 119 and 241 mature miRNA variants from Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon, Triticum aestivum, and Sorghum bicolor, respectively, and classified them with respect to their conservation status and expression levels. These Poaceae non-redundant miRNA species (1,669) were distributed over a total of 625 MIR families, among which only 54 were conserved across two or more plant species, confirming the relatively recent evolutionary differentiation of miRNAs in grasses. On the other hand, we have used 257 H. vulgare, 286T. aestivum, 119 B. distachyon, 269 O. sativa, and 139 S. bicolor NBS domains, which were either mined directly from the annotated proteomes, or predicted from whole genome sequence assemblies. The hybridization potential between miRNAs and their putative NBS genes targets was analyzed, revealing that at least 454 NBS genes from all five Poaceae were potentially regulated by 265 distinct miRNA species, most of them expressed in leaves and predominantly co-expressed in additional tissues. Based on gene ontology, we could assign these probable miRNA target genes to 16 functional groups, among which three conferring resistance to bacteria (Rpm1, Xa1 and Rps2), and 13 groups of resistance to fungi (Rpp8,13, Rp3, Tsn1, Lr10, Rps1-k-1, Pm3, Rpg5, and MLA1,6,10,12,13). The results of the present analysis provide a large-scale platform for a better understanding of biological control strategies of disease resistance genes in Poaceae, and will serve as an important starting point for enhancing crop disease resistance improvement by means of transgenic lines with artificial miRNAs.
27251022	Genomic structure analysis of a set of Oryza nivara introgression lines and identification of yield-associated QTLs using whole-genome resequencing.	2016	Sci Rep	Oryza nivara, an annual wild AA-genome species of rice, is an important gene pool for broadening the genetic diversity of cultivated rice (O. sativa L.). Towards identifying and utilizing favourable alleles from O. nivara, we developed a set of introgression lines (ILs) by introducing O. nivara segments into the elite indica rice variety 93-11 background through advanced backcrossing and repeated selfing. Using whole-genome resequencing, a high-density genetic map containing 1,070 bin-markers was constructed for the 131 ILs, with an average length of 349 kb per bin. The 131 ILs cover 95% of O. nivara genome, providing a relatively complete genomic library for introgressing O. nivara alleles for trait improvement. Using this high-density bin-map, QTL mapping for 13 yield-related traits was performed and a total of 65 QTLs were detected across two environments. At ~36.9% of detected QTLs, the alleles from O. nivara conferred improving effects on yield-associated traits. Six cloned genes, Sh4/SHA1, Bh4, Sd1, TE/TAD1, GS3 and FZP, colocalised in the peak intervals of 9 QTLs. In conclusion, we developed new genetic materials for exploration and use of beneficial alleles from wild rice and provided a basis for future fine mapping and cloning of the favourable O. nivara-derived QTLs.
27363861	Dissection of the qTGW1.1 region into two tightly-linked minor QTLs having stable effects for grain weight in rice.	2016	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Most agronomical traits of crop species are complex traits controlled by multiple genes and affected by environmental factors. While considerable efforts have been made to fine-map and clone major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield-related traits in rice, it is not until recently that the attention has been paid to minor QTLs. Following previous dissection of QTLs for grain weight and grain size in a 12-Mb interval on the long arm of chromosome 1 in rice, this study targeted at one putative QTL region for a more precise mapping and for analyzing the genotype-by-environment interaction of minor QTLs.

RESULTS: Four BC2F10 plants of the indica rice cross ZS97///ZS97//ZS97/MY46 were selected. They carried overlapped heterozygous segments that jointly covered the entire putative region for qTGW1.1 detected previously. Four sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed from selfing progenies of the four plants. Each NIL set consisted of 32 ZS97 homozygous lines and 32 MY46 homozygous lines that differed in the corresponding heterozygous region. They were grown in two locations having distinct ecological conditions and measured for 1000-grain weight, grain length and grain width. Two QTLs were separated in an 835.2-kb interval flanked by DNA markers Wn28447 and RM11569. They both showed consistent effects across the two environments. The qTGW1.1a located within the 120.4-kb interval Wn28447 - RM11543 significantly affect all the three traits with the enhancing allele derived from ZS97, showing a stronger influence on grain weight than on grain length and width. The qTGW1.1b located in the 521.8-kb interval RM11554 - RM11569 significantly affect grain weight and length with the enhancing allele derived from MY46, having a stronger influence on grain length than on grain weight. Consistent performance of the two QTLs was confirmed in a validation experiment using five NIL-F2 populations segregated for either qTGW1.1a or qTGW1.1b.

CONCLUSION: Separation of closely-linked QTLs having small effects is achievable in the absence of major-QTL segregation. Minor QTLs for complex traits could act consistently in diverse environments, offering the potential of pyramiding beneficial alleles of multiple minor QTLs through marker-assisted selection.
27172458	Light-specific transcriptional regulation of the accumulation of carotenoids and phenolic compounds in rice leaves.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Carotenoids and phenolic compounds are important subgroups of secondary metabolites having an array of functional roles in the growth and development of plants. They are also major sources for health and pharmaceutical benefits, and industrially relevant biochemicals. The control of the biosynthesis of these compounds depends mainly on the quality and quantity of different light sources. Thus, to unravel their light-specific transcriptional regulation in rice leaves, we performed promoter analysis of genes upregulated in response to blue and red lights. The analysis results suggested a crosstalk between different phytohormones and the involvement of key transcription factors such as bHLH, bZIP, MYB, WRKY, ZnF and ERF [jasmonic acid inducible], in the regulation of higher accumulation of carotenoids and phenolic compounds upon blue light. Overall, the current analysis could improve our understanding of the light-specific regulatory mechanism involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites via possible critical links between different TFs in rice leaves.
27366148	FullSSR: Microsatellite Finder and Primer Designer.	2016	Adv Bioinformatics	Microsatellites are genomic sequences comprised of tandem repeats of short nucleotide motifs widely used as molecular markers in population genetics. FullSSR is a new bioinformatic tool for microsatellite (SSR) loci detection and primer design using genomic data from NGS assay. The software was tested with 2000 sequences of Oryza sativa shotgun sequencing project from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Trace Archive and with partial genome sequencing with ROCHE 454® from Caiman latirostris, Salvator merianae, Aegla platensis, and Zilchiopsis collastinensis. FullSSR performance was compared against other similar SSR search programs. The results of the use of this kind of approach depend on the parameters set by the user. In addition, results can be affected by the analyzed sequences because of differences among the genomes. FullSSR simplifies the detection of SSRs and primer design on a big data set. The command line interface of FullSSR was intended to be used as part of genomic analysis tools pipeline; however, it can be used as a stand-alone program because the results are easily interpreted for a nonexpert user.
27345721	WRKY transcription factor genes in wild rice Oryza nivara.	2016	DNA Res	The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant development and stress response. Although many WRKY genes have been studied in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), the WRKY genes in the wild rice species Oryza nivara, the direct progenitor of O. sativa, have not been studied. O. nivara shows abundant genetic diversity and elite drought and disease resistance features. Herein, a total of 97 O. nivara WRKY (OnWRKY) genes were identified. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that OnWRKY genes were generally expressed at higher levels in the roots of 30-day-old plants. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that most of OnWRKY genes could be induced by salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and drought. Abundant potential MAPK phosphorylation sites in OnWRKYs suggest that activities of most OnWRKYs can be regulated by phosphorylation. Phylogenetic analyses of OnWRKYs support a novel hypothesis that ancient group IIc OnWRKYs were the original ancestors of only some group IIc and group III WRKYs. The analyses also offer strong support that group IIc OnWRKYs containing the HVE sequence in their zinc finger motifs were derived from group Ia WRKYs. This study provides a solid foundation for the study of the evolution and functions of WRKY genes in O. nivara.
27348754	Fungal Elicitor MoHrip2 Induces Disease Resistance in Rice Leaves, Triggering Stress-Related Pathways.	2016	PLoS One	MoHrip2 Magnaporthe oryzae hypersensitive protein 2 is an elicitor protein of rice blast fungus M. oryzae. Rice seedlings treated with MoHrip2 have shown an induced resistance to rice blast. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this MoHrip2 elicitation in rice, we used differential-display 2-D gel electrophoresis and qRT-PCR to assess the differential expression among the total proteins extracted from rice leaves at 24 h after treatment with MoHrip2 and buffer as a control. Among ~1000 protein spots detected on each gel, 10 proteins were newly induced, 4 were up-regulated, and 3 were down-regulated in MoHrip2-treated samples compared with the buffer control. Seventeen differentially expressed proteins were detected using MS/MS analysis and categorized into six groups according to their putative function: defense-related transcriptional factors, signal transduction-related proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, programmed cell death (PCD), defense-related proteins, and photosynthesis and energy-related proteins. The qPCR results (relative expression level of genes) further supported the differential expression of proteins in MoHrip2-treated rice leaves identified with 2D-gel, suggesting that MoHrip2 triggers an early defense response in rice leaves via stress-related pathways, and the results provide evidence for elicitor-induced resistance at the protein level.
27309534	Comparison of Chain-Length Preferences and Glucan Specificities of Isoamylase-Type α-Glucan Debranching Enzymes from Rice, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteria.	2016	PLoS One	It has been believed that isoamylase (ISA)-type α-glucan debranching enzymes (DBEs) play crucial roles not only in α-glucan degradation but also in the biosynthesis by affecting the structure of glucans, although molecular basis on distinct roles of the individual DBEs has not fully understood. In an attempt to relate the roles of DBEs to their chain-length specificities, we analyzed the chain-length distribution of DBE enzymatic reaction products by using purified DBEs from various sources including rice, cyanobacteria, and bacteria. When DBEs were incubated with phytoglycogen, their chain-length specificities were divided into three groups. First, rice endosperm ISA3 (OsISA3) and Eschericia coli GlgX (EcoGlgX) almost exclusively debranched chains having degree of polymerization (DP) of 3 and 4. Second, OsISA1, Pseudomonas amyloderamosa ISA (PsaISA), and rice pullulanase (OsPUL) could debranch a wide range of chains of DP≧3. Third, both cyanobacteria ISAs, Cyanothece ATCC 51142 ISA (CytISA) and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 ISA (ScoISA), showed the intermediate chain-length preference, because they removed chains of mainly DP3-4 and DP3-6, respectively, while they could also react to chains of DP5-10 and 7-13 to some extent, respectively. In contrast, all these ISAs were reactive to various chains when incubated with amylopectin. In addition to a great variation in chain-length preferences among various ISAs, their activities greatly differed depending on a variety of glucans. Most strikingly, cyannobacteria ISAs could attack branch points of pullulan to a lesser extent although no such activity was found in OsISA1, OsISA3, EcoGlgX, and PsaISA. Thus, the present study shows the high possibility that varied chain-length specificities of ISA-type DBEs among sources and isozymes are responsible for their distinct functions in glucan metabolism.
27318280	Hd18, Encoding Histone Acetylase Related to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D, is Involved in the Control of Flowering Time in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Flowering time is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.), because it defines harvest seasons and cultivation areas, and affects yields. We used a map-based strategy to clone Heading date 18 (Hd18). The difference in flowering time between the Japanese rice cultivars Koshihikari and Hayamasari was due to a single nucleotide polymorphism within the Hd18 gene, which encodes an amine oxidase domain-containing protein and is homologous to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD). The Hayamasari Hd18 allele and knockdown of Hd18 gene expression delayed the flowering time of rice plants regardless of the day-length condition. Structural modeling of the Hd18 protein suggested that the non-synonymous substitution changed protein stability and function due to differences in interdomain hydrogen bond formation. Compared with those in Koshihikari, the expression levels of the flowering-time genes Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice flowering locus T1 (RFT1) were lower in a near-isogenic line with the Hayamasari Hd18 allele in a Koshihikari genetic background. We revealed that Hd18 acts as an accelerator in the rice flowering pathway under both short- and long-day conditions by elevating transcription levels of Ehd1 Gene expression analysis also suggested the involvement of MADS-box genes such as OsMADS50, OsMADS51 and OsMADS56 in the Hd18-associated regulation of Ehd1 These results suggest that, like FLD, its rice homolog accelerates flowering time but is involved in rice flowering pathways that differ from the autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis.
27255512	Rice panicle plasticity in Near Isogenic Lines carrying a QTL for larger panicle is genotype and environment dependent.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Panicle architectural traits in rice (branching, rachis length, spikelet number) are established between panicle initiation and heading stages. They vary among genotypes and are prone to Genotype x Environment interactions. Together with panicle number, panicle architecture determines sink-based yield potential. Numerous studies analyzed genetic and environmental variation of plant morphology, but the plasticity of panicle structure is less well understood. This study addressed the response of rice panicle size and structure to limited light availability at plant level for near-isogenic lines (NILs) with IR64 or IRRI146 backgrounds, carrying the QTL qTSN4 (syn. SPIKE) for large panicles. Full light and shading in the greenhouse and two population densities in the field were implemented. The image analysis tool P-TRAP was used to analyze the architecture of detached panicles.

RESULTS: The qTSN4 increased total branch length, branching frequency and spikelet number per panicle in IRRI146 background in the field and greenhouse, and in IR64 background in the greenhouse, but not for IR64 in the field. In the field, however, qTSN4 reduced panicle number, neutralizing any potential yield gains from panicle size. Shading during panicle development reduced spikelet and branch number but qTSN4 mitigated partly this effect. Spikelet number over total branch length (spikelet density) was a stable allometry across genotypes and treatments with variation in spikelet number mainly due to the frequency of secondary branches. Spikelet number on the main tiller was correlated with stem growth rate during panicle development, indicating that effects on panicle size seemed related to resources available per tiller.

CONCLUSIONS: The qTSN4 effects on panicle spikelet number appear as indirect and induced by upstream effects on pre-floral assimilate resources at tiller level, as they were (1) prone to G x E interactions, (2) non-specific with respect to panicle architectural traits, and (3) associated with pre-floral stem growth rate.
27357232	Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of female-sterile rice ovule shed light on its abortive mechanism.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The comprehensive transcriptome analysis of rice female-sterile line and wild-type line ovule provides an important clue for exploring the regulatory network of the formation of rice fertile female gametophyte. Ovules are the female reproductive tissues of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and play a major role in sexual reproduction. To investigate the potential mechanism of rice female gametophyte fertility, we used RNA sequencing, combined with genetic subtraction, to compare the transcriptome of the ovules of a high-frequency female-sterile line (fsv1) and a rice wild-type line (Gui 99) during ovule development. Ovules were harvested at three developmental stages: ovule containing megaspore mother cell in meiosis process (stage 1), ovule containing functional megaspore in mitosis process (stage 2), and ovule containing mature female gametophyte (stage 3). Six cDNA libraries generated a total of 42.2 million high-quality clean reads that aligned with 30,204 genes. The comparison between the fsv1 and Gui 99 ovules identified a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), i.e., 45, 495, and 932 DEGs at the three ovule developmental stages, respectively. From the comparison of the two rice lines, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and MapMan analyses indicated that a large number of DEGs associated with starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, protein modification and degradation, oxidative phosphorylation, and receptor kinase. These DEGs might play roles in ovule development and fertile female gametophyte formation. Many transcription factor genes and epigenetic-related genes also exhibit different expression patterns and significantly different expression levels in two rice lines during ovule development, which might provide important information regarding the abortive mechanism of the female gametophyte in rice.
27294659	Signaling pathways of seed size control in plants.	2016	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Seed size is one of the most important yield traits in plants. In angiosperms, a mature seed consists of the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat, which develop from the zygote, the fertilized central cell and the maternal integuments, respectively. Seed size is therefore coordinately controlled by the growth of maternal and zygotic tissues. Several signaling pathways that determine seed size by influencing the endosperm and/or maternal tissue growth have been identified, including the IKU pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, phytohormones and transcriptional regulatory factors. The functions of several seed size regulators are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice; therefore it is promising to convert basic research on seed size into practical applications in crops. In this review, we summarize recent research progress on seed size control, with particular emphasis on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of several newly identified regulators of seed size in Arabidopsis and rice.
27336625	Hydrolyzed Proteins in Allergy.	2016	Nestle Nutr Inst Workshop Ser	Hydrolyzed proteins are used worldwide in the therapeutic management of infants with allergic manifestations and have long been proposed as a dietetic measure to prevent allergy in at risk infants. The degree and method of hydrolysis, protein source and non-nitrogen components characterize different hydrolyzed formulas (HFs) and may determine clinical efficacy, tolerance and nutritional effects. Cow's milk (CM)-based HFs are classified as extensively (eHF) or partially HF (pHF) based on the percentage of small peptides. One whey pHF has been shown to reduce atopic dermatitis in high-risk infants who are not exclusively breastfed. More studies are needed to determine the benefit of these formulas in the prevention of CM allergy (CMA) and in the general population. eHFs represent up to now the treatment of choice for most infants with CMA. However, new developments, such as an extensively hydrolyzed rice protein-based formula, could become alternative options if safety and nutritional and therapeutic efficacy are confirmed as this type of formula is less expensive. In some countries, an extensive soy hydrolysate is available.
27252468	SLG controls grain size and leaf angle by modulating brassinosteroid homeostasis in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Grain size and leaf angle are two important traits determining grain yield in rice. However, the mechanisms regulating the two traits remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized a rice gain-of-function mutant, slender grain Dominant (slg-D), which exhibited longer and narrower grains and larger leaf angles, similar to plants with elevated brassinosteroid (BR) levels or strengthened BR signaling. The increased cell length is responsible for the mutant phenotypes in slg-D We demonstrated that the phenotype of slg-D is caused by enhanced expression of SLG, a BAHD acyltransferase-like protein gene. SLG is preferentially expressed in young panicles and lamina joints, implying its role in controlling cell growth in those two tissues. slg-D was restored to wild type by treatment with brassinazole, an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis. Overexpression of SLG in d11-2 (deficient in BR synthesis) and d61-1 (deficient in BR signaling) did not change the existing phenotypes. The slg-D plants had elevated BR contents and, accordingly, expression of BR-related genes was changed in a manner similar to BR treatment. Moreover, SLG RNAi plants displayed mild BR-deficient phenotypes including shorter grains, smaller leaf angles, and compact semi-dwarf plant types. The in vitro biochemical assays and transgenic approaches collectively demonstrated that SLG functions as homomers. Taken together, we conclude that SLG is an important regulator in BR homeostasis and that manipulation of SLG expression to an optimal level may provide a way to develop an ideal plant type.
27379107	Over-Expression of the Pikh Gene with a CaMV 35S Promoter Leads to Improved Blast Disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Magnaporthe oryzae is a rice blast fungus and plant pathogen that causes a serious rice disease and, therefore, poses a threat to the world's second most important food security crop. Plant transformation technology has become an adaptable system for cultivar improvement and to functionally analyze genes in plants. The objective of this study was to determine the effects (through over-expressing and using the CaMV 35S promoter) of Pikh on MR219 resistance because it is a rice variety that is susceptible to the blast fungus pathotype P7.2. Thus, a full DNA and coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the Pikh gene, 3172 bp, and 1206 bp in length, were obtained through amplifying the gDNA and cDNA template from a PH9-resistant rice variety using a specific primer. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology was also used to introduce the Pikh gene into the MR219 callus. Subsequently, transgenic plants were evaluated from the DNA to protein stages using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), semi-quantitative RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Transgenic plants were also compared with a control using a real-time quantification technique (to quantify the pathogen population), and transgenic and control plants were challenged with the local most virulent M. oryzae pathotype, P7.2. Based on the results, the Pikh gene encodes a hydrophilic protein with 18 sheets, 4 helixes, and 21 coils. This protein contains 401 amino acids, among which the amino acid sequence from 1 to 376 is a non-cytoplasmic region, that from 377 to 397 is a transmembrane region, and that from 398 to 401 is a cytoplasmic region with no identified disordered regions. The Pikh gene was up-regulated in the transgenic plants compared with the control plants. The quantity of the amino acid leucine in the transgenic rice plants increased significantly from 17.131 in the wild-type to 47.865 mg g(-1) in transgenic plants. The M. oryzae population was constant at 31, 48, and 72 h after inoculation in transgenic plants, while it was increased in the inoculated control plants. This study successfully clarified that over-expression of the Pikh gene in transgenic plants can improve their blast resistance against the M. oryzae pathotype P7.2.
27336225	The superwoman1-cleistogamy2 mutant is a novel resource for gene containment in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Outcrossing between cultivated plants and their related wild species may result in the loss of favourable agricultural traits in the progeny or escape of transgenes in the environment. Outcrossing can be physically prevented by using cleistogamous (i.e. closed-flower) plants. In rice, flower opening is dependent on the mechanical action of fleshy organs called lodicules, which are generally regarded as the grass petal equivalents. Lodicule identity and development are specified by the action of protein complexes involving the SPW1 and OsMADS2 transcription factors. In the superwoman1-cleistogamy1 (spw1-cls1) mutant, SPW1 is impaired for heterodimerization with OsMADS2 and consequently spw1-cls1 shows thin, ineffective lodicules. However, low temperatures help stabilise the mutated SPW1/OsMADS2 heterodimer and lodicule development is restored when spw1-cls1 is grown in a cold environment, resulting in the loss of the cleistogamous phenotype. To identify a novel, temperature-stable cleistogamous allele of SPW1, targeted and random mutations were introduced into the SPW1 sequence and their effects over SPW1/OsMADS2 dimer formation were assessed in yeast two-hybrid experiments. In parallel, a novel cleistogamous allele of SPW1 called spw1-cls2 was isolated from a forward genetic screen. In spw1-cls2, a mutation leading to a change of an amino acid involved in DNA binding by the transcription factor was identified. Fertility of spw1-cls2 is somewhat decreased under low temperatures but unlike for spw1-cls1, the cleistogamous phenotype is maintained, making the line a safer and valuable genetic resource for gene containment.
27273847	Model biases in rice phenology under warmer climates.	2016	Sci Rep	Climate-induced crop yields model projections are constrained by the accuracy of the phenology simulation in crop models. Here, we use phenology observations from 775 trials with 19 rice cultivars in 5 Asian countries to compare the performance of four rice phenology models (growing-degree-day (GDD), exponential, beta and bilinear models) when applied to warmer climates. For a given cultivar, the difference in growing season temperature (GST) varied between 2.2 and 8.2 °C in different trials, which allowed us to calibrate the models for lower GST and validate under higher GST, with three calibration experiments. The results show that in warmer climates the bilinear and beta phenology models resulted in gradually increasing bias for phenology predication and double yield bias per percent increase in phenology simulation bias, while the GDD and exponential models maintained a comparatively constant bias. The phenology biases were primarily attributed to varying phenological patterns to temperature in models, rather than on the size of the calibration dataset. Additionally, results suggest that model simulations based on multiple cultivars provide better predictability than using one cultivar. Therefore, to accurately capture climate change impacts on rice phenology, we recommend simulations based on multiple cultivars using the GDD and exponential phenology models.
27356912	Genome-wide identification and analysis of rice genes preferentially expressed in pollen at an early developmental stage.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Microspore production using endogenous developmental programs has not been well studied. The main limitation is the difficulty in identifying genes preferentially expressed in pollen grains at early stages. To overcome this limitation, we collected transcriptome data from anthers and microspore/pollen and performed meta-expression analysis. Subsequently, we identified 410 genes showing preferential expression patterns in early developing pollen samples of both japonica and indica cultivars. The expression patterns of these genes are distinguishable from genes showing pollen mother cell or tapetum-preferred expression patterns. Gene Ontology enrichment and MapMan analyses indicated that microspores in rice are closely linked with protein degradation, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA biosynthesis and regulation, while the pollen mother cell or tapetum are strongly associated with cell wall metabolism, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, and RNA biosynthesis and regulation. We also generated transgenic lines under the control of the promoters of eight microspore-preferred genes and confirmed the preferred expression patterns in plants using the GUS reporting system. Furthermore, cis-regulatory element analysis revealed that pollen specific elements such as POLLEN1LELAT52, and 5659BOXLELAT5659 were commonly identified in the promoter regions of eight rice genes with more frequency than estimation. Our study will provide new sights on early pollen development in rice, a model crop plant.
27457988	Tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis NPR1 gene in rice for sheath blight resistance without compromising phenotypic cost.	2016	Plant Sci	Rice sheath blight disease, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is considered the second most important disease of rice after blast. NPR1 (non expressor of PR1) is the central regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) conferring broad spectrum resistance to various pathogens. Previous reports have indicated that constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 (AtNPR1) gene results in disease resistance in rice but has a negative impact on growth and agronomic traits. Here, we report that green tissue-specific expression of AtNPR1 in rice confers resistance to the sheath blight pathogen, with no concomitant abnormalities in plant growth and yield parameters. Elevated levels of NPR1 activated the defence pathway in the transgenic plants by inducing expression of endogenous genes such as PR1b, RC24, and PR10A. Enhanced sheath blight resistance of the transgenic plants was evaluated using three different bioassay systems. A partially isolated toxin from R. solani was used in the bioassays to measure the resistance level. Studies of the phenotype and yield showed that the transgenic plants did not exhibit any kind of phenotypic imbalances. Our results demonstrate that green tissue-specific expression of AtNPR1 is an effective strategy for controlling the sheath blight pathogen. The present work in rice can be extended to other crop plants severely damaged by the pathogen.
27325119	Rice bifunctional phytocystatin is a dual modulator of legumain and papain-like proteases.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Phytocystatins are well-known inhibitors of C1A cysteine proteinases. However, previous research has revealed legumain (C13) protease inhibition via a carboxy-extended phytocystatin. Among the 12 phytocystatins genes in rice, OcXII is the only gene possessing this carboxy-terminal extension. The specific legumain inhibition activity was confirmed, in our work, using a recombinant OcXII harboring only the carboxy-terminal domain and this part did not exhibit any effect on papain-like activities. Meanwhile, rice plants silenced at the whole OcXII gene presented higher legumain and papain-like proteolytic activities, resulting in a faster initial seedling growth. However, when germinated under stressful alkaline conditions, OcXII-silenced plants exhibited impaired root formation and delayed shoot growth. Interestingly, the activity of OcXII promoter gene was detected in the rice seed scutellum region, and decreases with seedling growth. Seeds from these plants also exhibited slower growth at germination under ABA or alkaline conditions, while maintaining very high levels of OcXII transcriptional activation. This likely reinforces the proteolytic control necessary for seed germination and growth. In addition, increased legumain activity was detected in OcXII RNAi plants subjected to a fungal elicitor. Overall, the results of this study highlight the association of OcXII with not only plant development processes, but also with stress response pathways. The results of this study reinforce the bifunctional ability of carboxy-extended phytocystatins in regulating legumain proteases via its carboxy-extended domain and papain-like proteases by its amino-terminal domain.
27292630	Biological nitrification inhibition by rice root exudates and its relationship with nitrogen-use efficiency.	2016	New Phytol	Microbial nitrification in soils is a major contributor to nitrogen (N) loss in agricultural systems. Some plants can secrete organic substances that act as biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs), and a small number of BNIs have been identified and characterized. However, virtually no research has focused on the important food crop, rice (Oryza sativa). Here, 19 rice varieties were explored for BNI potential on the key nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea. Exudates from both indica and japonica genotypes were found to possess strong BNI potential. Older seedlings had higher BNI abilities than younger ones; Zhongjiu25 (ZJ25) and Wuyunjing7 (WYJ7) were the most effective genotypes among indica and japonica varieties, respectively. A new nitrification inhibitor, 1,9-decanediol, was identified, shown to block the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) pathway of ammonia oxidation and to possess an 80% effective dose (ED80 ) of 90 ng μl-1 . Plant N-use efficiency (NUE) was determined using a 15 N-labeling method. Correlation analyses indicated that both BNI abilities and 1,9-decanediol amounts of root exudates were positively correlated with plant ammonium-use efficiency and ammonium preference. These findings provide important new insights into the plant-bacterial interactions involved in the soil N cycle, and improve our understanding of the BNI capacity of rice in the context of NUE.
27362847	Two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysate protein complexes of rice in response to salt stress.	2016	J Plant Physiol	To understand the biology of a plant in response to stress, insight into protein-protein interactions, which almost define cell behavior, is thought to be crucial. Here, we provide a comparative complexomics analysis of leaf whole cell lysate of two rice genotypes with contrasting responses to salt using two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE (2D-BN/SDS-PAGE). We aimed to identify changes in subunit composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes elicited by salt. Using mild detergent for protein complex solubilization, we were able to identify 9 protein assemblies as hetero-oligomeric and 30 as homo-oligomeric complexes. A total of 20 proteins were identified as monomers in the 2D-BN/SDS-PAGE gels. In addition to identifying known protein complexes that confirm the technical validity of our analysis, we were also able to discover novel protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, an interaction was detected for glycolytic enzymes enolase (ENO1) and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and also for a chlorophyll a-b binding protein and RuBisCo small subunit. To show changes in subunit composition and stoichiometry of protein assemblies during salt stress, the differential abundance of interacting proteins was compared between salt-treated and control plants. A detailed exploration of some of the protein complexes provided novel insight into the function, composition, stoichiometry and dynamics of known and previously uncharacterized protein complexes in response to salt stress.
27252469	Homologs of SCAR/WAVE complex components are required for epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Filamentous actins (F-actins) play a vital role in epidermal cell morphogenesis. However, a limited number of studies have examined actin-dependent leaf epidermal cell morphogenesis events in rice. In this study, two recessive mutants were isolated: less pronounced lobe epidermal cell2-1 (lpl2-1) and lpl3-1, whose leaf and stem epidermis developed a smooth surface, with fewer serrated pavement cell (PC) lobes, and decreased papillae. The lpl2-1 also exhibited irregular stomata patterns, reduced plant height, and short panicles and roots. Molecular genetic studies demonstrated that LPL2 and LPL3 encode the PIROGI/Specifically Rac1-associated protein 1 (PIR/SRA1)-like and NCK-associated protein 1 (NAP1)-like proteins, respectively, two components of the suppressor of cAMP receptor/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-family verprolin-homologous protein (SCAR/WAVE) regulatory complex involved in actin nucleation and function. Epidermal cells exhibited abnormal arrangement of F-actins in both lpl2 and lpl3 expanding leaves. Moreover, the distorted trichomes of Arabidopsis pir could be partially restored by an overexpression of LPL2 A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that LPL2 can directly interact with LPL3 in vitro Collectively, the results indicate that LPL2 and LPL3 are two functionally conserved homologs of the SCAR/WAVE complex components, and that they play an important role in controlling epidermal cell morphogenesis in rice by organising F-actin.
27321231	A two-year field measurement of methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from rice paddies under contrasting climate conditions.	2016	Sci Rep	The effects of three irrigation levels (traditional normal amount of irrigation [NA100%], 70%, and 30% of the normal amount [NA70% and NA30%]) and two rice varieties (Oryza sativa L. Huayou14 and Hanyou8) on CH4 and N2O emissions were investigated over two years under contrasting climate conditions (a 'warm and dry' season in 2013 and a normal season in 2014). Hanyou8 was developed as a drought-resistant variety. The mean seasonal air temperature in 2013 was 2.3 °C higher than in 2014, while the amount of precipitation from transplanting to the grain-filling stage in 2013 was only 36% of that in 2014. CH4 emission rose by 93-161%, but rice grain yield fell by 7-13% in 2013, compared to 2014 under the NA100% conditions. Surface standing water depths (SSWD) were higher in Hanyou8 than in Huayou14 due to the lower water demand by Hanyou8. A reduction in the amount of irrigation water applied can effectively reduce the CH4 emissions regardless of the rice variety and climate condition. However, less irrigation during the 'warm and dry' season greatly decreased Huayou14 grain yield, but had little impact on Hanyou8. In contrast, N2O emission depended more on fertilization and SSWD than on rice variety.
27367676	Modulation of PPAR Expression and Activity in Response to Polyphenolic Compounds in High Fat Diets.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors that modulate energy metabolism in liver, adipose tissue and muscle. High fat diets (HFD) can negatively impact PPAR expression or activity, favoring obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and other conditions. However, polyphenols (PP) found in vegetable foodstuffs are capable of positively modulating this pathway. We therefore focused this review on the possible effects that PP can have on PPAR when administered together with HFD. We found that PP from diverse sources, such as coffee, olives, rice, berries and others, are capable of inducing the expression of genes involved in a decrease of adipose mass, liver and serum lipids and lipid biosynthesis in animal and cell models of HFD. Since cells or gut bacteria can transform PP into different metabolites, it is possible that a synergistic or antagonistic effect ultimately occurs. PP molecules from vegetable sources are an interesting option to maintain or return to a state of energy homeostasis, possibly due to an adequate PPAR expression and activity.
27297403	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: As the indispensable part of plant, leaf blade mainly functions as the production workshops where organic substance is produced by photosynthesis. Leaf colour mutation is a genetic phenomenon that has a high frequency and is easily identified. The mutations always exhibit negative impact on the development of plants in any of the different stages of growth. Up to now, numerous genes involved in leaf colour mutations have been cloned.

RESULTS: In this study, a yellow-green leaf mutant, yellow-green leaf 8 (ygl8), with stable genetic phenotype, has been screened out in the progeny of an excellent indica restorer line Jinhui 10 with seeds treated by EMS. The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl8 than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the lamellae were clearly intumescent and intricately stacked in ygl8. Furthermore, compared with those of the WT, the stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of ylg8 were all significantly lower. Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa). Complementation of ygl8 with the WT DNA sequence of Loc_Os01g73450 led to restoration of the normal phenotype, and transgenic RNA interference plants showed a yellow-green colour. Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of Ygl8 indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues. qRT-PCR also showed that the expression levels of the major Photosystem I core subunits plastome-encoded PsaA, PsaB and PsbC were significantly reduced in ygl8. The expression levels of nuclear-encoded gene involved in Chl biosynthesis HEMC, HEME, and PORA were also decreased when compared with the wild-type.

CONCLUSIONS: Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, YGL8 may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis.
27252467	Biofortification of rice with the essential amino acid lysine: molecular characterization, nutritional evaluation, and field performance.	2016	J Exp Bot	Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a major staple crop worldwide, has limited levels of the essential amino acid lysine. We previously produced engineered rice with increased lysine content by expressing bacterial aspartate kinase and dihydrodipicolinate synthase and inhibiting rice lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase activity. However, the grain quality, field performance, and integration patterns of the transgenes in these lysine-enriched lines remain unclear. In the present study, we selected several elite transgenic lines with endosperm-specific or constitutive regulation of the above key enzymes but lacking the selectable marker gene. All target transgenes were integrated into the intragenic region in the rice genome. Two pyramid transgenic lines (High Free Lysine; HFL1 and HFL2) with free lysine levels in seeds up to 25-fold that of wild type were obtained via a combination of the above two transgenic events. We observed a dramatic increase in total free amino acids and a slight increase in total protein content in both pyramid lines. Moreover, the general physicochemical properties were improved in pyramid transgenic rice, but the starch composition was not affected. Field trials indicated that the growth of HFL transgenic rice was normal, except for a slight difference in plant height and grain colour. Taken together, these findings will be useful for the potential commercialization of high-lysine transgenic rice.
27379149	Triacontanol Reduces Transplanting Shock in Machine-Transplanted Rice by Improving the Growth and Antioxidant Systems.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Machine transplantation results in serious transplant shock in seedlings and results in a longer recover stage, which negatively impacts the growth of low-position tillers and the yield of machine-transplanted rice. A barrel experiment was conducted to examine the effect of the foliar application of triacontanol (TRIA) on machine-transplanted rice during the recovery stage. TRIA (0, 1, 5, and 10 μM) was sprayed over leaves 2 days before transplanting. The chlorophyll content, sucrose content, oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme levels, glutathione (GSH), and ascorbate (ASA) redox states, tiller dynamics and yield components of the plants were investigated. The results show that foliar-applied TRIA significantly alleviates the growth inhibition and oxidative damage caused by transplant shock. Furthermore, the application of TRIA increased the chlorophyll and sucrose contents of the plants. Importantly, TRIA not only significantly improved the activity of catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD), demonstrating that POD can play an important role in scavenging H2O2 during the recovery stage, but it also enhanced the redox states of ASA and GSH by regulating the activities of enzymes involved in the ASA-GSH cycle, such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR). A dose of 10 μM TRIA was the most efficient in reducing the negative effects of transplant shock, increasing the panicles, grain filling, and grain yield per hill by 17.80, 5.86, and 16.49%, respectively. These results suggest that TRIA acts to reduce transplant shock in association with the regulation of the redox states of ASA and GSH and antioxidant enzymes and serves as an effective antioxidant to maintain photosynthetic capacity and promote the occurrence of low tillers.
27217091	The components of rice and watermelon root exudates and their effects on pathogenic fungus and watermelon defense.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is susceptible to wilt disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp niveum (FON). Intercropping management of watermelon/aerobic rice (Oryza sativa) alleviates watermelon wilt disease, because some unidentified component(s) in rice root exudates suppress FON sporulation and spore germination. Here, we show that the phenolic acid p-coumaric acid is present in rice root exudates only, and it inhibits FON spore germination and sporulation. We found that exogenously applied p-coumaric acid up-regulated the expression of ClPR3 in roots, as well as increased chitinase activity in leaves. Furthermore, exogenously applied p-coumaric acid increased β-1,3-glucanase activity in watermelon roots. By contrast, we found that ferulic acid was secreted by watermelon roots, but not by rice roots, and that it stimulated spore germination and sporulation of FON. Exogenous application of ferulic acid down-regulated ClPR3 expression and inhibited chitinase activity in watermelon leaves. Salicylic acid was detected in both watermelon and rice root exudates, which stimulated FON spore germination at low concentrations and suppressed spore germination at high concentrations. Exogenously applied salicylic acid did not alter ClPR3 expression, but did increase chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities in watermelon leaves. Together, our results show that the root exudates of phenolic acids were different between rice and watermelon, which lead to their special ecological roles on pathogenic fungus and watermelon defense.
27372278	Generation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate from acetate in higher plants: Detection of acetoacetyl CoA reductase- and PHB synthase- activities in rice.	2016	J Plant Physiol	It has been reported that Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is generated from acetate in the rice root. However, no information is available about the biosynthetic pathway of PHB from acetate in plant cells. In the bacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16 (R. eutropha), PHB is synthesized from acetyl CoA by the consecutive reaction of three enzymes: β-ketothiolase (EC: 2.3.1.9), acetoacetyl CoA reductase (EC: 1.1.1.36) and PHB synthase (EC: 2.3.1.-). Thus, in this study, we examined whether the above three enzymatic activities were also detected in rice seedlings. The results clearly showed that the activities of the above three enzymes were all detected in rice. In particular, the PHB synthase activity was detected specifically in the sonicated particulate fractions (2000g 10min precipitate (ppt) and the 8000g 30min ppt) of rice roots and leaves. In addition to these enzyme activities, several new experimental results were obtained on PHB synthesis in higher plants: (a) (14)C-PHB generated from 2-(14)C-acetate was mainly localized in the 2000g 10min ppt and the 8000g 30min ppt of rice root. (b) Addition of acetate (0.1-10mM) to culture medium of rice seedlings did not increase the content of PHB in the rice root or leaf. (c) In addition to C3 plants, PHB was generated from acetate in a C4 plant (corn) and in a CAM plant (Bryophyllum pinnatum). d) Washing with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) strongly suggested that the PHB synthesized from acetate was of plant origin and was not bacterial contamination.
27327960	Genome-Wide Characterization of Major Intrinsic Proteins in Four Grass Plants and Their Non-Aqua Transport Selectivity Profiles with Comparative Perspective.	2016	PLoS One	Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), commonly known as aquaporins, transport not only water in plants but also other substrates of physiological significance and heavy metals. In most of the higher plants, MIPs are divided into five subfamilies (PIPs, TIPs, NIPs, SIPs and XIPs). Herein, we identified 68, 42, 38 and 28 full-length MIPs, respectively in the genomes of four monocot grass plants, specifically Panicum virgatum, Setaria italica, Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the grass plants had only four MIP subfamilies including PIPs, TIPs, NIPs and SIPs without XIPs. Based on structural analysis of the homology models and comparing the primary selectivity-related motifs [two NPA regions, aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter and Froger's positions (FPs)] of all plant MIPs that have been experimentally proven to transport non-aqua substrates, we predicted the transport profiles of all MIPs in the four grass plants and also in eight other plants. Groups of MIP subfamilies based on ar/R selectivity filter and FPs were linked to the non-aqua transport profiles. We further deciphered the substrate selectivity profiles of the MIPs in the four grass plants and compared them with their counterparts in rice, maize, soybean, poplar, cotton, Arabidopsis thaliana, Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii. In addition to two NPA regions, ar/R filter and FPs, certain residues, especially in loops B and C, contribute to the functional distinctiveness of MIP groups. Expression analysis of transcripts in different organs indicated that non-aqua transport was related to expression of MIPs since most of the unexpressed MIPs were not predicted to facilitate the transport of non-aqua molecules. Among all MIPs in every plant, TIP (BdTIP1;1, SiTIP1;2, SbTIP2;1 and PvTIP1;2) had the overall highest mean expression. Our study generates significant information for understanding the diversity, evolution, non-aqua transport profiles and insight into comparative transport selectivity of plant MIPs, and provides tools for the development of transgenic plants.
27318700	Development of Oryza sativa L. by Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud. monosomic addition lines with high value traits by interspecific hybridization.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: This paper describes the development of monosomic alien addition and disomic introgression lines through a cross between autotetraploid indica rice and Oryza punctata toward tapping valuable traits for rice improvement. Oryza punctata is a distantly related wild Oryza species having BB genome with untapped genetic resources for rice improvement. Low crossability between the cultivated O. sativa and O. punctata restricts the success of transferring many desirable traits into cultivated rice. Artificially induced autotetraploids of an elite breeding line, IR31917-45-3-2, were produced and crossed with O. punctata. Allotriploid F1 plants were backcrossed to IR31917-45-3-2 and generated progenies with extra chromosomes from O. punctata. Twenty BC1F1 and 59 BC2F1 plants were produced with chromosome numbers ranging from 24 (2n) to 29 (2n + 5) and 2n (24) to 26 (2n + 2), respectively. Eleven monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) were characterized morphologically and cytologically and designated as MAAL 1-12. MAALs were genotyped using O. punctata genome-specific molecular markers and detected chromosome segments inherited from O. punctata. O. punctata introgressions across all the chromosomes of O. sativa were identified except for chromosome 8. The most frequent introgressions were observed in chromosomes 4, 6, 10, and 11, which could be the recombination hotspots between A and B genomes. Some of the qualitative traits such as black hull, purple coleoptile base, purple stigma, long awn, and short grain size from O. punctata were inherited in some disomic introgression lines (DILs). Several DILs inherited genes from O. punctata conferring resistance to brown planthopper, green leafhopper, and diseases such as bacterial blight and blast. This is the first report on successful gene transfer from O. punctata into O. sativa.
27403427	Functional Characterization of 9-/13-LOXs in Rice and Silencing Their Expressions to Improve Grain Qualities.	2016	Biomed Res Int	Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are involved in oxidative rancidity and render rice unsuitable for human consumption. Here, RNA interference- (RNAi-) induced gene expression inhibition was used to analyze the functions of the bran/seed-specific LOXs in rice. r9-LOX1 and L-2 (9-LOX category) were the candidate genes expressing a bran/seed-specific LOX, while RCI-1 was (13-LOX category) a plastid-specific LOX. Real-time PCR showed that three LOXs were cultivar/tissue specific expression on a certain level. r9-LOX1 and L-2 were generally much higher in active bran/seed than in stabilized bran, mature seed, and regenerated plant. RCI-1 was barely expressed in seed. In transgenic lines, r9-LOX1, as well as L-2, expression was dramatically downregulated, compared to the nontransgenic controls. SPME/GC-MS analysis of r9-LOX1 RNAi transgenic lines showed 74.33% decrease in nonanal content (formed during oxidation of linoleic acid by lipoxygenase), but 388.24% increase in acetic acid and 184.84% hexanal (direct products of 13-LOX). These results indicate that r9-LOX1 positively regulates the amount of nonanal but negatively regulates acetic acid and hexanal. The negative regulation may be due to a mechanism of negative feedback between LOX family members. The information will help comprehensively understand the function of the bran/seed-specific LOXs, r9-LOX1, and improve the storage quality in the future.
27390892	Production of superoxide from photosystem II-light harvesting complex II supercomplex in STN8 kinase knock-out rice mutants under photoinhibitory illumination.	2016	J Photochem Photobiol B	When phosphorylation of Photosystem (PS) II core proteins is blocked in STN8 knock-out mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) under photoinhibitory illumination, the mobilization of PSII supercomplex is prevented. We have previously proposed that more superoxide (O2(-)) is produced from PSII in the mutant (Nath et al., 2013, Plant J. 76, 675-686). Here, we clarify the type and site for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using both histochemical and fluorescence probes, we observed that, compared with wild-type (WT) leaves, levels of ROS, including O2(-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), were increased when leaves from mutant plants were illuminated with excess light. However, singlet oxygen production was not enhanced under such conditions. When superoxide dismutase was inhibited, O2(-) production was increased, indicating that it is the initial event prior to H2O2 production. In thylakoids isolated from WT leaves, kinase was active in the presence of ATP, and spectrophotometric analysis of nitrobluetetrazolium absorbance for O2(-) confirmed that PSII-driven superoxide production was greater in the mutant thylakoids than in the WT. This contrast in levels of PSII-driven superoxide production between the mutants and the WT plants was confirmed by conducting protein oxidation assays of PSII particles from osstn8 leaves under strong illumination. Those assays also demonstrated that PSII-LHCII supercomplex proteins were oxidized more in the mutant, thereby implying that PSII particles incur greater damage even though D1 degradation during PSII-supercomplex mobilization is partially blocked in the mutant. These results suggest that O2(-) is the major form of ROS produced in the mutant, and that the damaged PSII in the supercomplex is the primary source of O2(-).
27289587	Carbohydrate metabolism in germinating caryopses of Oryza sativa L. exposed to prolonged anoxia.	2016	J Plant Res	Anoxia tolerance can be evaluated not only in terms of growth or survival of plant organs during oxygen deprivation, but also in relation to carbohydrate utilization in the context of a well-modulated fermentative metabolism. Rice (Oryza spp.) is unique among cereals, in that it has the distinctive ability to germinate under complete anaerobiosis by using the starchy reserves in its seeds to fuel the anaerobic metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of germinating rice seedlings to survive a long-term oxygen deficiency [40 days after sowing (DAS)] and the effects on sugar metabolism, focusing on starch degradation as well as soluble sugars transport and storage under anoxia. No significant decline in vitality occurred until 30 DAS though no recovery was detected following longer anoxic treatments. Growth arrest was observed following anoxic treatments longer that 20 DAS, in concomitance with considerably lower ethanol production. Amylolytic activity in embryos and endosperms had similar responses to anoxia, reaching maximum content 30 days after the onset of stress, following which the levels declined for the remainder of the experiment. Under anoxia, average amylolytic activity was twofold higher in embryos than endosperms. Efficient starch degradation was observed in rice under anoxia at the onset of the treatment but it decreased over time and did not lead to a complete depletion. Our analysis of α-amylase activity did not support the hypothesis that starch degradation plays a critical role in explaining differences in vitality and coleoptile growth under prolonged oxygen deprivation.
27506365	One step derivatization with British Anti-Lewsite in combination with gas chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and selective analysis of inorganic arsenic in rice.	2016	Anal Chim Acta	We developed a new fast and selective analytical method for the determination of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in rice by a gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in combination with one step derivatization of inorganic arsenic (iAs) with British Anti-Lewsite (BAL). Two step derivatization of iAs with BAL has been previously performed for the GC-MS analysis. In this paper, the quantitative one step derivatization condition was successfully established. The GC-MS/MS was carried out with a short nonpolar capillary column (0.25 mm × 10 m) under the conditions of fast oven temperature ramp rate (4 °C/s) and high linear velocity (108.8 cm/s) of the carrier gas. The established GC-MS/MS method showed an excellent linearity (r(2) > 0.999) in a tested range (0.2-100.0 μg L(-1)), ultra-low limit of detection (LOD, 0.08 pg), and high precision and accuracy. The GC-MS/MS technique showed far greater selectivity (22.5 fold higher signal to noise ratio in rice sample) on iAs than GC-MS method. The gas chromatographic running time was only 2.5 min with the iAs retention time of 1.98 min. The established method was successfully applied to quantify the iAs contents in polished rice. The mean iAs content in the Korean polished rice (n = 27) was 66.1 μg kg(-1) with the range of 37.5-125.0 μg kg(-1). This represents the first report on the GC-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with the one step derivatization with BAL for the iAs speciation in rice. This GC-MS/MS method would be a simple, useful and reliable measure for the iAs analysis in rice in the laboratories in which the expensive and element specific HPLC-ICP-MS is not available.
27446145	Geographically Distinct and Domain-Specific Sequence Variations in the Alleles of Rice Blast Resistance Gene Pib.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice blast is caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, which is the most destructive fungal pathogen affecting rice growing regions worldwide. The rice blast resistance gene Pib confers broad-spectrum resistance against Southeast Asian M. oryzae races. We investigated the allelic diversity of Pib in rice germplasm originating from 12 major rice growing countries. Twenty-five new Pib alleles were identified that have unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and/or deletions, in addition to the polymorphic nucleotides that are shared between the different alleles. These partially or completely shared polymorphic nucleotides indicate frequent sequence exchange events between the Pib alleles. In some of the new Pib alleles, nucleotide diversity is high in the LRR domain, whereas, in others it is distributed among the NB-ARC and LRR domains. Most of the polymorphic amino acids in LRR and NB-ARC2 domains are predicted as solvent-exposed. Several of the alleles and the unique SNPs are country specific, suggesting a diversifying selection of alleles in various geographical locations in response to the locally prevalent M. oryzae population. Together, the new Pib alleles are an important genetic resource for rice blast resistance breeding programs and provide new information on rice-M. oryzae interactions at the molecular level.
27446120	PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important layer of gene regulation that produces mRNAs that have different 3' ends and/or encode diverse protein isoforms. Up to 70% of annotated genes in plants undergo APA. Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants.
27289079	Ectopic activation of the rice NLR heteropair RGA4/RGA5 confers resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases.	2016	Plant J	Bacterial blight (BB) and bacterial leaf streak (BLS) are important diseases in Oryza sativa caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), respectively. In both bacteria, transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are major virulence determinants that act by transactivating host genes downstream of effector-binding elements (EBEs) bound in a sequence-specific manner. Resistance to Xoo is mostly related to the action of TAL effectors, either by polymorphisms that prevent the induction of susceptibility (S) genes or by executor (R) genes with EBEs embedded in their promoter, and that induce cell death and resistance. For Xoc, no resistance sources are known in rice. Here, we investigated whether the recognition of effectors by nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat domain immune receptors (NLRs), the most widespread resistance mechanism in plants, is also able to stop BB and BLS. In one instance, transgenic rice lines harboring the AVR1-CO39 effector gene from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, under the control of an inducible promoter, were challenged with transgenic Xoo and Xoc strains carrying a TAL effector designed to transactivate the inducible promoter. This induced AVR1-CO39 expression and triggered BB and BLS resistance when the corresponding Pi-CO39 resistance locus was present. In a second example, the transactivation of an auto-active NLR by Xoo-delivered designer TAL effectors resulted in BB resistance, demonstrating that NLR-triggered immune responses efficiently control Xoo. This forms the foundation for future BB and BLS disease control strategies, whereupon endogenous TAL effectors will target synthetic promoter regions of Avr or NLR executor genes.
27322607	Genetically modified rice Bt-Shanyou63 expressing Cry1Ab/c protein does not harm Daphnia magna.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The genetically modified (GM) rice Bt-ShanYou63 (Bt-SY63) received an official biosafety certificate while its safety remained in dispute. In a lifelong study, Daphnia magna were experimentally fed a basal diet of rice flours from Bt-SY63 or its parental rice ShanYou63 (SY63) at concentrations of 0.2mg, 0.3mg, or 0.4mgC (per individual per day). Overall the survival, body size, and reproduction of the animals were comparable between Bt-SY63 and ShanYou63.. The results showed that no signiﬁcant differences were observed in growth and reproduction parameters between D. magna fed GM and non-GM flour and no dose-related changes occurred in all the values. Based on the different parameters assessed, the GM rice Bt-SY63 is a safe food source for D. magna that does not differ in quality from non-GM rice.
27328708	MYB31/MYB42 Syntelogs Exhibit Divergent Regulation of Phenylpropanoid Genes in Maize, Sorghum and Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	ZmMYB31 and ZmMYB42 are R2R3-MYB transcription factors implicated in the regulation of phenylpropanoid genes in maize. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the regulatory function of MYB31 and MYB42 is conserved in other monocots, specifically in sorghum and rice. We demonstrate that syntelogs of MYB31 and MYB42 do bind to phenylpropanoid genes that function in all stages of the pathway and in different tissues along the developmental gradient of seedling leaves. We found that caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT1) is a common target of MYB31 and MYB42 in the mature leaf tissues of maize, sorghum and rice, as evidenced by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In contrast, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL2), ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H), and caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE), were targeted by MYB31 or MYB42, but in a more species-specific fashion. Our results revealed MYB31 and MYB42 participation in auto- and cross-regulation in all three species. Apart from a limited conservation of regulatory modules, MYB31 and MYB42 syntelogs appear to have undergone subfunctionalization following gene duplication and divergence of maize, sorghum, and rice. Elucidating the different regulatory roles of these syntelogs in the context of positive transcriptional activators may help guide attempts to alter the flux of intermediates towards lignin production in biofuel grasses.
27342100	The miR393a/target module regulates seed germination and seedling establishment under submergence in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Cell Environ	The conserved miRNA393 family is thought to be involved in root elongation, leaf development and stress responses, but its role during seed germination and seedling establishment remains unclear. In this study, expression of the MIR393a/target module and its role in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds were investigated. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) analysis showed that MIR393a and OsTIR1 had spatial-temporal transcriptional activities in radicle roots, coleoptile tips and stomata cells, corresponding to a dynamic auxin response. miR393a promoted primary root elongation when rice seeds were germinated in air and inhibited coleoptile elongation and stomatal development when seeds were submerged. Under submergence, the expression of miR393a was inhibited, and then the auxin response was induced. In the process, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2, auxin receptor genes, were negatively regulated by miR393. We found that miR393a inhibited stomatal development and coleoptile elongation but promoted free indole acetic acid (IAA) accumulation in the rice coleoptile tips. In addition, exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) enhanced the expression of miR393 and inhibited coleoptile growth. Together, miR393a/target plays a role in coleoptile elongation and stomatal development via modulation of auxin signalling during seed germination and seedling establishment under submergence. This study provides new perspectives on the direct sowing of rice seeds in flooded paddy fields.
27337541	MID1 plays an important role in response to drought stress during reproductive development.	2016	Plant J	Drought during rice reproductive development results in yield loss. It is important to understand the functions of drought-responsive genes in reproductive tissues for improving rice yield under water-deficit conditions. We show here that MID1 (MYB Important for Drought Response1), encoding a putative R-R-type MYB-like transcription factor, can improve rice yield under drought. MID1 was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses. Compared with wild type, MID1-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to drought at both vegetative and reproductive stages and produced more grains under water stress. MID1-overexpressing plants exhibited less severe anther defects such as deformed anther locules, abnormal tapetum, degenerated microspores and expanded middle layer, with improved pollen fertility and higher seed setting rate. MID1 was localized to the nucleus and could activate gene expression in yeast, and its homologs were identified in many other plants with high levels sequence similarity. In addition, candidate MID1-regulated genes were analyzed using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, including genes crucial for stress responses and anther development, with altered expressions in the florets of MID1-overexpressing plants and RNAi lines. Furthermore, MID1 could bind to the promoters of two drought-related genes (Hsp17.0 and CYP707A5) and one anther developmental gene (KAR) according to ChIP-qPCR data. Our findings suggest that MID1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement.
27264781	2-Hydroxymelatonin promotes the resistance of rice plant to multiple simultaneous abiotic stresses (combined cold and drought).	2016	J Pineal Res	We investigated the physiological roles of 2-hydroxymelatonin (2-OHMel) in rice seedlings. When they were challenged with simultaneous multiple abiotic stressors, such as a combination of cold and drought, those pretreated with 2-OHMel were resistant, whereas no tolerance was observed in seedlings treated with either melatonin or water (control). The tolerance phenotype was associated with the induction of several transporter proteins, including the proton transporter (UCP1), potassium transporter (HKT1), and water channel protein (PIP2;1). Treatment with 2-OHMel increased the content of the osmoprotectant proline and maintained mitochondrial structure when plants were subjected to a combination of cold and drought stress. We screened the corresponding transcription factors (TFs) for 2-OHMel-mediated resistance to the combined stressors through analysis of large numbers of cold- and drought-related TFs. Two TFs, Myb4 and AP37, were only induced by 2-OHMel treatment. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing rice Myb4 were not resistant to the combined stressors; however, the expression of UCP1, HKT1, and PIP2;1 transcripts was slightly enhanced. These data show that 2-OHMel alleviates the effects of simultaneous abiotic stressors via the actions of multiple TFs, including Myb4 and AP37.
27473144	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice leaves are important energy source for the whole plant. An optimal structure will be beneficial for rice leaves to capture light energy and exchange gas, thus increasing the yield of rice. Moderate leaf rolling and relatively erect plant architecture may contribute to high yield of rice, but the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear.

RESULTS: In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2. Histological analysis showed that the rel2 mutant has increased number of bulliform cells and reduced size of middle bulliform cells. We firstly mapped REL2 to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy. Further analysis revealed that REL2 encodes a protein containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. In rel2 mutant, the mutation of two nucleotide substitutions in DUF630 domain led to the loss-of-function of REL2 locus and the function of REL2 could be confirmed by complementary expression of REL2 in rel2 mutant. Further studies showed that REL2 protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the REL2 gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice. The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc.

CONCLUSIONS: REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice. It is the plasma membrane localization and its functions in the control of leaf morphology might involve in multiple biological processes such as bulliform cell development and auxin synthesis and transport.
27474933	Genome-wide analysis of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) gene family and functional characterization of FBA7 in tomato.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme in plants that is involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the Calvin cycle. FBA genes play significant roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses and also regulate growth and development. Despite the importance of FBA genes, little is known about it in tomato. In this study, we identified 8 FBA genes in tomato and classified them into 2 subgroups based on a phylogenetic tree, gene structures, and conserved motifs. Five (SlFBA1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and three (SlFBA6, 7, and 8) SlFBA proteins were predicted to be localized in chloroplasts and cytoplasm, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of FBAs from tomato, Arabidopsis, rice, and other organisms suggested that SlFBA shared the highest protein homology with FBAs from other plants. Synteny analysis indicated that segmental duplication events contributed to the expansion of the tomato FBA family. The expression profiles revealed that all SlFBAs were involved in the response to low and high temperature stresses. SlFBA7 overexpression increased the expression and activities of other main enzymes in Calvin cycle, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), seed size and stem diameter. SlFBA7 overexpression enhanced tolerances in seed germination under suboptimal temperature stresses. Taken together, comprehensive analyses of SlFBAs would provide a basis for understanding of evolution and function of SlFBA family.
27403778	Marker-aided Incorporation of Xa38, a Novel Bacterial Blight Resistance Gene, in PB1121 and Comparison of its Resistance Spectrum with xa13 + Xa21.	2016	Sci Rep	Basmati rice is preferred internationally because of its appealing taste, mouth feel and aroma. Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB1121) is a widely grown variety known for its excellent grain and cooking quality in the international and domestic market. It contributes approximately USD 3 billion to India's forex earning annually by being the most traded variety. However, PB1121 is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease. A novel BB resistance gene Xa38 was incorporated in PB1121 from donor parent PR114-Xa38 using a modified marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) scheme. Phenotypic selection prior to background selection was instrumental in identifying the novel recombinants with maximum recovery of recurrent parent phenome. The strategy was effective in delimiting the linkage drag to <0.5 mb upstream and <1.9 mb downstream of Xa38 with recurrent parent genome recovery upto 96.9% in the developed NILs. The NILs of PB1121 carrying Xa38 were compared with PB1121 NILs carrying xa13 + Xa21 (developed earlier in our lab) for their resistance to BB. Both NILs showed resistance against the Xoo races 1, 2, 3 and 6. Additionally, Xa38 also resisted Xoo race 5 to which xa13 + Xa21 was susceptible. The PB1121 NILs carrying Xa38 gene will provide effective control of BB in the Basmati growing region.
27436282	Systems analysis of cis-regulatory motifs in C4 photosynthesis genes using maize and rice leaf transcriptomic data during a process of de-etiolation.	2016	J Exp Bot	Identification of potential cis-regulatory motifs controlling the development of C4 photosynthesis is a major focus of current research. In this study, we used time-series RNA-seq data collected from etiolated maize and rice leaf tissues sampled during a de-etiolation process to systematically characterize the expression patterns of C4-related genes and to further identify potential cis elements in five different genomic regions (i.e. promoter, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, intron, and coding sequence) of C4 orthologous genes. The results demonstrate that although most of the C4 genes show similar expression patterns, a number of them, including chloroplast dicarboxylate transporter 1, aspartate aminotransferase, and triose phosphate transporter, show shifted expression patterns compared with their C3 counterparts. A number of conserved short DNA motifs between maize C4 genes and their rice orthologous genes were identified not only in the promoter, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, and coding sequences, but also in the introns of core C4 genes. We also identified cis-regulatory motifs that exist in maize C4 genes and also in genes showing similar expression patterns as maize C4 genes but that do not exist in rice C3 orthologs, suggesting a possible recruitment of pre-existing cis-elements from genes unrelated to C4 photosynthesis into C4 photosynthesis genes during C4 evolution.
27520410	Emerging insights into heterotrimeric G protein signaling in plants.	2016	J Genet Genomics	Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in diverse eukaryotic organisms. In plants, the repertoire of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, which is composed of the Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits, is much simpler than that in metazoans, and the identity of typical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) together with their ligands still remains unclear. Comparative phenotypic analysis in Arabidopsis and rice plants using gain- and loss-of-function mutants of G protein components revealed that heterotrimeric G protein signaling plays important roles in a wide variety of plant growth and developmental processes. Grain yield is a complex trait determined by quantitative trait loci (QTL) and is influenced by soil nitrogen availability and environmental changes. Recent studies have shown that the manipulation of two non-canonical Gγ subunits, GS3 (GRAIN SIZE 3) and DEP1 (DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1), represents new strategies to simultaneously increase grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice. This review discusses the latest advances in our understanding of the heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction pathway and its application in improving yield and stress tolerance in crops.
27447698	Effects of short-term high temperature on grain quality and starch granules of rice (Oryza sativa L.) at post-anthesis stage.	2017	Protoplasma	High temperature causes negative effects on grain yield and quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, the effects of short-term high temperature (SHT) on grain quality and starch granules were investigated in two rice cultivars Nanjing 41 (NJ41, heat-sensitive) and Wuxiangjing 14 (WJ14, heat-tolerant) at post-anthesis stage (anthesis and early grain-filling stage). The results of rice quality analysis showed that chalky rate and chalkiness increased while brown rice rate, milled rice rate, and head rice rate decreased in two rice cultivars with the increase of high temperature and prolonged duration. Moreover, SHT stress reduced the accumulation of amylose as well as starch accumulation. The starch accumulation and eating quality were more sensitive to SHT than the appearance and milling quality. The starch structure data observed by scanning electron microscope further showed that the starch granules are arranged loosely and more single starch granules appeared after SHT treatment. The extent of change in rice quality and starch traits of WJ14 under SHT was lower than that of NJ41. The effects of SHT at anthesis stage were greater than that at grain-filling stage. Taken together, the results could help further understand the physiological and biochemical processes governing rice quality under high-temperature conditions.
27468288	Phenotypic and Marker-Assisted Genetic Enhancement of Parental Lines of Rajalaxmi, an Elite Rice Hybrid.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The cytoplasmic male sterile line system comprising CRMS 32A and its maintainer line CRMS 32B is a popular choice for the development of new hybrids in India as CRMS 32A, having Kalinga 1 cytoplasm (other than WA), is a viable alternative to WA cytoplasm. However, both lines are susceptible to bacterial blight (BB), a major disease on rice. As enhancement of host plant resistance is the most effective and economical strategy to control this disease, four resistance genes (Xa4, xa5, xa13, and Xa21) were transferred from a BB pyramid line of IR64, into the A and B lines using a marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB) breeding strategy. During the transfer of genes into CRMS 32B, foreground selection was applied using markers associated with the genes, and plants having resistance alleles of the donor, are selected. Selection for morphological and quality traits was practiced to select plants similar to the recurrent parent. The four gene and three gene pyramid lines exhibited high levels of resistance against the BB pathogen when challenged with eight virulent isolates. Using genome wide based SSR markers for background selection, pyramids having >95% of the recurrent parent genome were identified. With CRMS 32B gene pyramid as donor, the four resistance genes were transferred into the A line through repeated backcrosses and the A line pyramids also exhibited high level of resistance against BB. Through a combination of selection at phenotypic and molecular levels, four BB resistance genes were successfully introduced into two parental lines (CRMS 32 B and A) of Rajalaxmi, an elite popular hybrid. The pyramided B lines did exhibit high levels of resistance against BB. Selection for morphological and quality traits and background selection hastened the recovery of the recurrent parent genome in the recombinants. Through repeated backcrosses, all the four resistance genes were transferred to CRMS 32A and test crosses suggest that the maintenance ability of the improved CRMS 32B lines is intact. These improved maintainer and CMS lines can directly be used in hybrid rice breeding and the new hybrids can play an important role in sustainable rice production in India.
27516765	Expression of a Cystatin Transgene in Eggplant Provides Resistance to Root-knot Nematode, Meloidogyne incognita.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Root-knot nematodes (RKN) cause substantial yield decline in eggplant and sustainable management options to minimize crop damage due to nematodes are still limited. A number of genetic engineering strategies have been developed to disrupt the successful plant-nematode interactions. Among them, delivery of proteinase inhibitors from the plant to perturb nematode development and reproduction is arguably the most effective strategy. In the present study, transgenic eggplant expressing a modified rice cystatin (OC-IΔD86) gene under the control of the root-specific promoter, TUB-1, was generated to evaluate the genetically modified nematode resistance. Five putative transformants were selected through PCR and genomic Southern blot analysis. Expression of the cystatin transgene was confirmed in all the events using western blotting, ELISA and qPCR assay. Upon challenge inoculation, all the transgenic events exhibited a detrimental effect on RKN development and reproduction. The best transgenic line (a single copy event) showed 78.3% inhibition in reproductive success of RKN. Our results suggest that cystatins can play an important role for improving nematode resistance in eggplant and their deployment in gene pyramiding strategies with other proteinase inhibitors could ultimately enhance crop yield.
27411514	Activation tagging in indica rice identifies ribosomal proteins as potential targets for manipulation of water-use efficiency and abiotic stress tolerance in plants.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	We have generated 3900 enhancer-based activation-tagged plants, in addition to 1030 stable Dissociator-enhancer plants in a widely cultivated indica rice variety, BPT-5204. Of them, 3000 were screened for water-use efficiency (WUE) by analysing photosynthetic quantum efficiency and yield-related attributes under water-limiting conditions that identified 200 activation-tagged mutants, which were analysed for flanking sequences at the site of enhancer integration in the genome. We have further selected five plants with low Δ13 C, high quantum efficiency and increased plant yield compared with wild type for a detailed investigation. Expression studies of 18 genes in these mutants revealed that in four plants one of the three to four tagged genes became activated, while two genes were concurrently up-regulated in the fifth plant. Two genes coding for proteins involved in 60S ribosomal assembly, RPL6 and RPL23A, were among those that became activated by enhancers. Quantitative expression analysis of these two genes also corroborated the results on activating-tagging. The high up-regulation of RPL6 and RPL23A in various stress treatments and the presence of significant cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions along with the high up-regulation of several of RPL genes in various stress treatments indicate that they are potential targets for manipulating WUE/abiotic stress tolerance.
27439383	Iron plaque decreases cadmium accumulation in Oryza sativa L. and serves as a source of iron.	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Cadmium (Cd) contamination occurs in paddy soils; hence it is necessary to reduce Cd content of rice. Application and mode of action of ferrous sulphate in minimizing Cd in rice was monitored in the present study. Pot culture with Indian rice variety Swarna (MTU 7029) was maintained in Cd-spiked soil containing ferrous sulphates, which is expected to reduce Cd accumulation in rice. Responses in rhizosphere pH, root surface, metal accumulation in plant and molecular physiological processes were monitored. Iron plaque was induced on root surfaces after FeSO4 application and the amount of Fe in plaque reduced with increases in Cd in the soil. Rhizosphere pH decreased during plaque formation and became more acidic due to secretion of organic acids from the roots under Cd treatment. Moreover, iron chelate reductase activity increased with Cd treatment, but in the absence of Cd, activity of this enzyme increased in plaque-induced plants. Cd treatment caused expression of OsYSL18, whereas OsYSL15 was expressed only in roots without iron plaque. Fe content of plants increased during plaque formation, which protected plants from Cd-induced Fe deficiency and metal toxicity. This was corroborated with increased biomass, chlorophyll content and quantum efficiency of photo-synthesis among plaque-induced plants. We conclude that ferrous sulphate-induced iron plaque prevents Cd accumulation and Fe deficiency in rice. Iron released from plaque via organic acid mediated dissolution during Cd stress.
27393148	Overexpression of SpCBL6, a calcineurin B-like protein of Stipa purpurea, enhanced cold tolerance and reduced drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2016	Mol Biol Rep	The purpose of the present study was to characterize SpCBL6 (GenBank accession number: KT780442) from Stipa purpurea and elucidate the function of this protein in abiotic stress. The full-length cDNA of SpCBL6 was isolated from S. purpurea by rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. Laser confocal microscopy was used to analyze the subcellular localization of SpCBL6. The constructs of 35S:GFP-SpCBL6 was used to transform wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia-0) with the floral dip method. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), water potential, photosynthetic efficiency (F v/F m), and ion leakage was performed to investigate the role of SpCBL6 in abiotic stress. The open reading frame of SpCBL6 contains 681 bp nucleotides and encodes a 227-amino acid polypeptide. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SpCBL6 showed the highest similarity with rice OsCBL6. SpCBL6 transcripts were induced by freezing and drought treatments. Subcellular localization analysis showed that SpCBL6 was located in membrane of protoplast. Overexpression of SpCBL6 in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that the transgenic plants were more tolerant to cold treatment, but less tolerant to drought, compared with the plants. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the drought stress marker genes were inhibited in transgenic plants, whereas the cold stress marker genes were enhanced. Further analysis showed that SpCBL6-overexpressing plants showed enhanced water potential, photosynthetic efficiency (F v/F m), and reduced ion leakage compared with the wild-type after cold treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that SpCBL6, a new member of the CBL gene family isolated from S. purpurea, enhances cold tolerance and reduces drought tolerance in plants.
27543262	Rapid improvement of grain weight via highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex genome editing in rice.	2016	J Genet Genomics	
27450495	Comparative proteomics of the superior and inferior spikelets at the early grain filling stage in rice cultivars contrast for panicle compactness and ethylene evolution.	2016	J Plant Physiol	The breeding programmes in rice aimed at increasing the number of spikelets per panicle have been accompanied by poor grain filling in the inferior spikelets of large panicle rice, leading to yield disadvantage. The present study attempted to understand the reason for differential grain filling in the inferior and superior spikelets by comparative proteomics considering a compact-panicle rice cultivar Mahalaxmi and a lax-panicle rice cultivar Upahar, which show poor and good grain filling, respectively. An initial study of two rice cultivars for panicle compactness and grain filling revealed an inverse correlation between the two parameters. It was further observed that the panicle compactness in Mahalaxmi was associated with a higher evolution of ethylene by the spikelets, both superior and inferior, compared with the lax-panicle Upahar. The proteomic studies revealed that the superior and inferior spikelets of Mahalaxmi differentially expressed 21 proteins that were also expressed in Upahar. However, in Upahar, only two of these proteins were differentially expressed between the superior and inferior spikelets, indicating that the metabolic activities of the spikelets occupying the superior and inferior positions on the panicle were very different in Mahalaxmi compared with those in Upahar. Among the proteins that were downregulated in the inferior spikelets compared with the superior ones in Mahalaxmi were importin-α, elongation factor 1-β and cell division control protein 48, which are essential for cell cycle progression and cell division. Low expression of these proteins might inhibit endosperm cell division in the inferior spikelets, limiting their sink capacity and leading to poor grain filling compared to that in the superior spikelets. The poor grain filling in Mahalaxmi may also be a result of the high evolution of ethylene in the inferior spikelets, which is reflected from the observation that these spikelets showed significantly higher expression of S-adenosylmethionine synthase and the gene encoding the enzyme than the superior spikelets in this cultivar, but not in Upahar; S-adenosynlmethionine synthase catalyses the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the precursor of ethylene biosynthesis.
27447459	Genome-wide identification, characterisation and expression profiles of calcium-dependent protein kinase genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).	2017	J Appl Genet	In plant cells, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are important sensors of Ca2+ flux resulting from various environmental stresses like cold, drought or salt stress. Previous genome sequence analysis and comparative studies in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) defined a multi-gene family of CDPKs. Here, we identified and characterised the CDPK gene complement of the model plant, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Comparative analysis encompassed phylogeny reconstruction based on newly available barley genome sequence, as well as established model genomes (e.g. O. sativa, A. thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon). Functional gene copies possessed characteristic CDPK domain architecture, including a serine/threonine kinase domain and four regulatory EF-hand motifs. In silico verification was followed by measurements of transcript abundance via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The relative expression of CDPK genes was determined in the vegetative growth stage under intensifying drought stress conditions. The majority of barley CDPK genes showed distinct changes in patterns of expression during exposure to stress. Our study constitutes evidence for involvement of the barley CDPK gene complement in signal transduction pathways relating to adaptation to drought. Our bioinformatics and transcriptomic analyses will provide an important foundation for further functional dissection of the barley CDPK gene family.
27465821	Precise estimation of genomic regions controlling lodging resistance using a set of reciprocal chromosome segment substitution lines in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Severe lodging has occurred in many improved rice varieties after the recent strong typhoons in East and Southeast Asian countries. The indica variety Takanari possesses strong culm characteristics due to its large section modulus, which indicates culm thickness, whereas the japonica variety Koshihikari is subject to substantial bending stress due to its thick cortical fibre tissue. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for lodging resistance and to eliminate the effects of genetic background, we used reciprocal chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Takanari. The oppositional effects of QTLs for section modulus were confirmed in both genetic backgrounds on chromosomes 1, 5 and 6, suggesting that these QTLs are not affected by the genetic background and are controlled independently by a single factor. The candidate region of a QTL for section modulus included SD1. The section modulus of NIL-sd1 was lower than that of Koshihikari, whereas the section modulus of NIL-SD1 was higher than that of Takanari. This result indicated that those regions regulate the culm thickness. The reciprocal effects of the QTLs for cortical fibre tissue thickness were confirmed in both genetic backgrounds on chromosome 9 using CSSLs.
27414467	Separation of enzymatic functions and variation of spin state of rice allene oxide synthase-1 by mutation of Phe-92 and Pro-430.	2016	Bioorg Chem	Rice allene oxide synthase-1 mutants carrying F92L, P430A or F92L/P430A amino acid substitution mutations were constructed, recombinant mutant and wild type proteins were purified and their substrate preference, UV-vis spectra and heme iron spin state were characterized. The results show that the hydroperoxide lyase activities of F92L and F92L/P430A mutants prefer 13-hydroperoxy substrate to other hydroperoxydienoic acids or hydroperoxytrienoic acids. The Soret maximum was completely red-shifted in P430A and F92L/P430A mutants, but it was partially shifted in the F92L mutant. ESR spectral data showed that wild type, F92L and P430A mutants occupied high and low spin states, while the F92L/P430A mutant occupied only low spin state. The extent of the red shift of the Soret maximum increased as the population of low spin heme iron increased, suggesting that the spectral shift reflects the high to low transition of heme iron spin state in rice allene oxide synthase-1. Relative to wild type allene oxide synthase-1, the hydroperoxide lyase activities of F92L and F92L/P430A are less sensitive to inhibition by imidazole with (13S or 9S)-hydroperoxydienoic acid as substrate and more sensitive than wild type with (13S)-hydroperoxytrienoic acid as substrate. Our results suggest that hydroperoxydienoic acid is the preferred substrate for the hydroperoxide lyase activity and (13S)-hydroperoxytrienoic acid is the preferred substrate for allene oxide synthase activity of allene oxide synthase-1.
27457210	Detection of Novel QTLs Regulating Grain Size in Extra-Large Grain Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Lines.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Grain size is an important trait that affects rice yield. Although many genes that contribute to grain size have been cloned from mutants or by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis based on bi-parental mapping, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain-size determination remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified the lines with the largest grain size and detected novel QTLs affecting the grain size.

RESULTS: We screened the National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences Genebank database and identified two rice lines, BG23 with the widest grain and LG10 with the longest grain. Using these two lines, we performed QTL analysis for grain size. Eight QTLs were detected during the QTL analyses using F2 populations derived from crosses between the large-grain lines BG23 or LG10 and the middle-size grain cultivars Nipponbare and Kasalath. Both BG23 and LG10 possessed large-grain alleles of four major QTLs: GW2, GS3, qSW5/GW5, and GW8. Other three minor QTLs were derived from BG23. However, these QTLs did not explain the differences in grain size between these two lines. Additionally, four QTLs for grain length or width were detected in an F2 population derived from a cross between BG23 and LG10; this population lacked the strong effects of the four major QTLs shared by both parent plants. Of these newly detected QTLs, the effects of two QTLs, GL3b and GL6, were confirmed by progeny testing. Comparison of the length of inner epidermal cells in plants homozygous for BG23 and LG10 alleles indicated that GL3b and GL6 genes regulate cell elongation and cell division, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we detected 12 loci including 14 QTLs regulating grain size from two lines with largest grains available in Japanese stock. Of these loci, we confirmed the effect of two gene loci and mapped their candidate region. Identification of novel genes regulating grain size will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling grain size.
27414645	Whole Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing and Re-Examination of a Cytoplasmic Male Sterility-Associated Gene in Boro-Taichung-Type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Nuclear genome substitutions between subspecies can lead to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) through incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Boro-Taichung (BT)-type CMS rice was obtained by substituting the nuclear genome of Oryza sativa subsp. indica cultivar Chinsurah Boro II with that of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica cultivar Taichung 65. In BT-type CMS rice, the mitochondrial gene orf79 is associated with male sterility. A complete sequence of the Boro-type mitochondrial genome responsible for BT-type CMS has not been determined to date. Here, we used pyrosequencing to construct the Boro-type mitochondrial genome. The contiguous sequences were assembled into five circular DNA molecules, four of which could be connected into a single circle. The two resulting subgenomic circles were unable to form a reliable master circle, as recombination between them was scarcely detected. We also found an unequal abundance of DNA molecules for the two loci of atp6. These results indicate the presence of multi-partite DNA molecules in the Boro-type mitochondrial genome. Expression patterns were investigated for Boro-type mitochondria-specific orfs, which were not found in the mitochondria from the standard japonica cultivar Nipponbare. Restorer of fertility 1 (RF1)-dependent RNA processing has been observed in orf79-containing RNA but was not detected in other Boro-type mitochondria-specific orfs, supporting the conclusion that orf79 is a unique CMS-associated gene in Boro-type mitochondria.
27432349	Reference genes for accurate gene expression analyses across different tissues, developmental stages and genotypes in rice for drought tolerance.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) has been routinely used to quantify gene expression level. This technique determines the expression of a target gene by comparison to an internal control gene uniformly expressed among the samples analyzed. The reproducibility and reliability of the results depend heavily on the reference genes used. To achieve successful gene expression analyses for drought tolerance studies in rice, reference gene selection should be based on consistency in expression across variables. We aimed to provide reference genes that would be consistent across different tissues, developmental stages and genotypes of rice and hence improve the quality of data in qRT-PCR analysis.

FINDINGS: Ten candidate reference genes were screened from four ubiquitously expressed gene families by analyzing public microarray data sets that included profiles of multiple organs, developmental stages, and water availability status in rice. These genes were evaluated through qRT-PCR experiments with a rigorous statistical analysis to determine the best reference genes. A ubiquitin isogene showed the best gene expression stability as a single reference gene, while a 3-gene combination of another ubiquitin and two cyclophilin isogenes was the best reference gene combination. Comparison between the qRT-PCR and in-house microarray data on roots demonstrated reliability of the identified reference genes to monitor the differential expression of drought-related candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Specific isogenes from among the regularly used gene families were identified for use in qRT-PCR-based analyses for gene expression in studies on drought tolerance in rice. These were stable across variables of treatment, genotype, tissue and growth stage. A single gene and/or a three gene set analysis is recommended, based on the resources available.
27448032	Serine carboxypeptidase 46 Regulates Grain Filling and Seed Germination in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	Serine carboxypeptidase (SCP) is one of the largest groups of enzymes catalyzing proteolysis for functional protein maturation. To date, little is known about the function of SCPs in rice. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the gene structure and expression profile of 59 rice SCPs. SCP46 is dominantly expressed in developing seeds, particularly in embryo, endosperm and aleurone layers, and could be induced by ABA. Functional characterization revealed that knock-down of SCP46 resulted in smaller grain size and enhanced seed germination. Furthermore, scp46 seed germination became less sensitive to the ABA inhibition than the Wild-type did; suggesting SCP46 is involved in ABA signaling. As indicated by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis, numerous grain filling and seed dormancy related genes, such as SP, VP1 and AGPs were down-regulated in scp46. Yeast-two-hybrid assay also showed that SCP46 interacts with another ABA-inducible protein DI19-1. Taken together, we suggested that SCP46 is a master regulator of grain filling and seed germination, possibly via participating in the ABA signaling. The results of this study shed novel light into the roles of SCPs in rice.
27466812	Changes in the Lodging-Related Traits along with Rice Genetic Improvement in China.	2016	PLoS One	Rice yield potential was greatly improved since the green revolution, but the occurrence of lodging often restricts the achievement of potential yield. Currently, it is still obscure about how the lodging-related traits change along with the genetic improvement in yield potential of rice, although much efforts have been devoted to study the trend of and physiological mechanisms underlying changes in grain yield. Therefore, fourteen rice mega-varieties that were released and disseminated from 1930s to 2005 in China were investigated through a two-year experiment in the field condition. The results showed that large genotypic differences in lodging-related morphological traits were observed among these varieties. Lodging index (LI) of semi-dwarf varieties was significantly lower compared with that of SLX(Shenglixian). There were significant differences in LI among the semi-dwarf varieties, but no relationship between LI and the release year was found. Bending moment (BM) of semi-dwarf varieties released in 1940s-1980s was significantly lower than that of SLX. However, varieties released after 1980s had similar bending moment with SLX, but significantly higher breaking resistance (BR). The increase in both BM and BR after 1980s was related with the increase in internode diameter (ND) and stem fresh weight. Overall, this study disclosed the changing pattern of lodging-related traits in the genetic improvement of rice, and suggested that further increase in ND, internode dry weight (NDW) and dry weight per unit length (DWUL) of lower internode in modern super rice variety could effectively enhance lodging resistance and bring down LI.
27381440	Suppression of Jasmonic Acid-Mediated Defense by Viral-Inducible MicroRNA319 Facilitates Virus Infection in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal modulators of plant development and host-virus interactions. However, the roles and action modes of specific miRNAs involved in viral infection and host susceptibility remain largely unclear. In this study, we show that Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) infection caused increased accumulation of miR319 but decreased expression of miR319-regulated TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) genes, especially TCP21, in rice plants. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR319 or downregulating TCP21 exhibited disease-like phenotypes and showed significantly higher susceptibility to RRSV in comparison with the wild-type plants. In contrast, only mild disease symptoms were observed in RRSV-infected lines overexpressing TCP21 and especially in the transgenic plants overexpressing miR319-resistant TCP21. Both RRSV infection and overexpression of miR319 caused the decreased endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) levels along with downregulated expression of JA biosynthesis and signaling-related genes in rice. However, treatment of rice plants with methyl jasmonate alleviated disease symptoms caused by RRSV and reduced virus accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that the induction of miR319 by RRSV infection in rice suppresses JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection and symptom development.
27478151	Antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis and mechanism of action of the cationic octadecapeptide AmyI-1-18 and its amino acid-substituted analogs.	2016	J Biosci Bioeng	The antimicrobial peptide AmyI-1-18 is a cationic α-helical octadecapeptide derived from α-amylase in rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) that contains four cationic amino acid residues (two arginines and two lysines). To enhance the antibacterial activity of AmyI-1-18 against Porphyromonas gingivalis (a bacterium associated with periodontal disease), we synthesized 12 analogs bearing substitutions with alanine, leucine, and/or arginine that were designed based on helical wheel projections and investigated their antibacterial properties. The antibacterial properties of four analogs bearing substitution of a single arginine or lysine with alanine were almost similar to those of AmyI-1-18, suggesting that the antibacterial properties depend on the presence of three cationic amino acid residues. Of three single arginine-substituted analogs, AmyI-1-18(G12R) exhibited an antibacterial activity 2.8-fold higher [50% growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50): 4.6 μM] than that of AmyI-1-18 (IC50: 13 μM). Likewise, the antibacterial properties of two single leucine-substituted analogs were significantly enhanced; in particular, AmyI-1-18(N3L) exhibited an antibacterial activity (IC50: 2.5 μM) 5.2-fold higher than that of AmyI-1-18. The hemolytic activity of AmyI-1-18(N3L) against mammalian red blood cells was low (2% at 50 μM). A membrane-depolarization assay using a membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye revealed that, similar to AmyI-1-18, the antibacterial activity of AmyI-1-18(N3L) was not dependent on its membrane-disrupting activity. Our results demonstrate that the antibacterial properties of AmyI-1-18 against P. gingivalis are significantly improved, without a significant increase in hemolytic activity, by replacing asparagine with leucine at position 3.
27387148	A heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA4 prevents copper accumulation in rice grain.	2016	Nat Commun	Rice is a major source of calories and mineral nutrients for over half the world's human population. However, little is known in rice about the genetic basis of variation in accumulation of copper (Cu), an essential but potentially toxic nutrient. Here we identify OsHMA4 as the likely causal gene of a quantitative trait locus controlling Cu accumulation in rice grain. We provide evidence that OsHMA4 functions to sequester Cu into root vacuoles, limiting Cu accumulation in the grain. The difference in grain Cu accumulation is most likely attributed to a single amino acid substitution that leads to different OsHMA4 transport activity. The allele associated with low grain Cu was found in 67 of the 1,367 rice accessions investigated. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsHMA4 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with grain Cu concentrations tuned to both the concentration of Cu in the soil and dietary needs.
27471161	Mechanistic insights into mode of action of rice allene oxide synthase on hydroxyperoxides: An intermediate step in herbivory-induced jasmonate pathway.	2016	Comput Biol Chem	Various types of oxygenated fatty acids termed 'oxylipins' are involved in plant response to herbivory. Oxylipins like jasmonic acid (JA) and green leafy volatiles (GLVs) are formed by the action of enzymes like allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroxyperoxide lyase (HPL) respectively. In this study, we focus on AOS of Oryza sativa sb. Japonica, that interact with 9- and 13- hydroxyperoxides to produce intermediates of jasmonate pathway and compare it with rice HPL that yields GLVs. We attempt to elucidate the interaction pattern by computational docking protocols keeping the Arabidopsis AOS system as the reference model system. Both 9-hydroxyperoxide and 13-hydroxyperoxide fit into the active site of AOS completely with Phe347, Phe92, Ile463, Val345, and Asn278 being the common interacting residues. Phe347 and Phe92 were mutated with Leucine and docked again with the hydroxyperoxides. The Phe347→Leu347 mutant showed a different mode of action than AOS-hydroxyperoxide complex with Trp413 in direct bonding with the OOH group of 9-hydroxyperoxide. The loss of Lys88-OOH interaction in 13-hydroxyperoxide and loss-of-interaction of Leu347 indicated the importance of Phe347 residue in hydroxyperoxide catalysis. The second mutant Phe92→Leu92 also shows a very different interaction pattern with 13-hydroxyperoxide but not with 9-hydroxyperoxide.Therefore, it can be concluded that Phe347 is more crucial for AOS functionality than Phe92. The aromatic ring of a Phenylalanine residue is important for catalysis and its mutation affects the binding of the two ligands. Another important residue is Asn278 which is an important part of the AOS catalytic site for maintaining stability and can be compared with the Arabidopsis AOS residue Asn321. Lastly, the interaction of HPL with these two derivatives involves Leu363 residue instead of Phe347 and thus, validating the importance of Phe→Leu substitution to be the reason of different modes of action that result in completely different products from same substrates.
27441398	Joint Mapping and Allele Mining of the Rolled Leaf Trait in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	The rolled leaf trait, long considered to be a key component of plant architecture, represents an important target trait for improving plant architecture at the population level. We therefore performed linkage mapping using a set of 262 highly variable RILs from two rice cultivars (Minghui 63 and 02428) with minor differences in leaf rolling index (LRI) in conjunction with GWAS mapping of a random subset of the 1127 germplasms from the 3K Rice Genomes Project (3K Rice). A total of seven main-effect loci were found to underlie the transgressive segregation of progenies from parents with minor differences in LRI. Five of these loci were previously identified and two (qRl7b and qRl9b) are newly reported with additional evidence from GWAS mapping for qRl7b. A total of 18 QTLs were identified by GWAS, including four newly identified QTLs. Six QTLs were confirmed by linkage mapping with the above RIL population, and 83.3% were found to be consistent with previously reported loci based on comparative mapping. We also performed allele mining with representative SNPs and identified the elite germplasms for the improvement of rolled leaf trait. Most favorable alleles at the detected loci were contributed by various 3K Rice germplasms. By a re-scanning of the candidate region with more saturated SNP markers, we dissected the region harboring gRl4-2 into three subregions, in which the average effect on LRI was 3.5% with a range from 2.4 to 4.1% in the third subregion, suggesting the presence of a new locus or loci within this region. The representative SNPs for favorable alleles in the reliable QTLs which were consistently identified in both bi-parental mapping and GWAS, such as qRl4, qRl5, qRl6, qRl7a, and qRl7b will be useful for future molecular breeding programs for ideal plant type in rice.
27298579	Physiological and biochemical parameters for evaluation and clustering of rice cultivars differing in salt tolerance at seedling stage.	2016	Saudi J Biol Sci	Salinity tolerance levels and physiological changes were evaluated for twelve rice cultivars, including four white rice and eight black glutinous rice cultivars, during their seedling stage in response to salinity stress at 100 mM NaCl. All the rice cultivars evaluated showed an apparent decrease in growth characteristics and chlorophyll accumulation under salinity stress. By contrast an increase in proline, hydrogen peroxide, peroxidase (POX) activity and anthocyanins were observed for all cultivars. The K(+)/Na(+) ratios evaluated for all rice cultivars were noted to be highly correlated with the salinity scores thus indicating that the K(+)/Na(+) ratio serves as a reliable indicator of salt stress tolerance in rice. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on physiological salt tolerance indexes could clearly distinguish rice cultivars into 4 salt tolerance clusters. Noteworthy, in comparison to the salt-sensitive ones, rice cultivars that possessed higher degrees of salt tolerance displayed more enhanced activity of catalase (CAT), a smaller increase in anthocyanin, hydrogen peroxide and proline content but a smaller drop in the K(+)/Na(+) ratio and chlorophyll accumulation.
27448993	Differential expression of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade components post submergence in Oryza sativa ssp indica cv Pusa Basmati 1.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade has been extensively studied in plants. Recently, this important network has been implicated in imparting submergence tolerance by facilitating the phosphorylation of the SUB1A1 protein. In this study, we try to examine the speculative role of MAPK cascade components in another rice mega-variety Pusa Basmati 1. The study reports that potential MAPK cascade components are triggered by submergence stress. Overall, the results provide a brief understanding of activation of MAPK cascade components post submergence stress in a rice variety, which does not harbor the SUB1A1, and in turn, succumbs to prolonged submergence stress.
27420056	Interspecies and Intraspecies Analysis of Trehalose Contents and the Biosynthesis Pathway Gene Family Reveals Crucial Roles of Trehalose in Osmotic-Stress Tolerance in Cassava.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Trehalose is a nonreducing α,α-1,1-disaccharide in a wide range of organisms, and has diverse biological functions that range from serving as an energy source to acting as a protective/signal sugar. However, significant amounts of trehalose have rarely been detected in higher plants, and the function of trehalose in the drought-tolerant crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is unclear. We measured soluble sugar concentrations of nine plant species with differing levels of drought tolerance and 41 cassava varieties using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). Significantly high amounts of trehalose were identified in drought-tolerant crops cassava, Jatropha curcas, and castor bean (Ricinus communis). All cassava varieties tested contained high amounts of trehalose, although their concentrations varied from 0.23 to 1.29 mg·g(-1) fresh weight (FW), and the trehalose level was highly correlated with dehydration stress tolerance of detached leaves of the varieties. Moreover, the trehalose concentrations in cassava leaves increased 2.3-5.5 folds in response to osmotic stress simulated by 20% PEG 6000. Through database mining, 24 trehalose pathway genes, including 12 trehalose-6-phosphate synthases (TPS), 10 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases (TPP), and two trehalases were identified in cassava. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were four cassava TPS genes (MeTPS1-4) that were orthologous to the solely active TPS gene (AtTPS1 and OsTPS1) in Arabidopsis and rice, and a new TPP subfamily was identified in cassava, suggesting that the trehalose biosynthesis activities in cassava had potentially been enhanced in evolutionary history. RNA-seq analysis indicated that MeTPS1 was expressed at constitutionally high level before and after osmotic stress, while other trehalose pathway genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated, which may explain why cassava accumulated high level of trehalose under normal conditions. MeTPS1 was then transformed into tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Results indicated that transgenic tobacco lines accumulated significant level of trehalose and possessed improved drought stress tolerance. In conclusion, cassava accumulated significantly high amount of trehalose under normal conditions due to multiplied trehalose biosynthesis gene families and constant expression of the active MeTPS1 gene. High levels of trehalose subsequently contributed to high drought stress tolerance.
27472897	A host basal transcription factor is a key component for infection of rice by TALE-carrying bacteria.	2016	Elife	Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are sequence-specific DNA binding proteins found in a range of plant pathogenic bacteria, where they play important roles in host-pathogen interactions. However, it has been unclear how TALEs, after they have been injected into the host cells, activate transcription of host genes required for infection success. Here, we show that the basal transcription factor IIA gamma subunit TFIIAγ5 from rice is a key component for infection by the TALE-carrying bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent for bacterial blight. Direct interaction of several TALEs with TFIIAγ5 is required for activation of disease susceptibility genes. Conversely, reduced expression of the TFIIAγ5 host gene limits the induction of susceptibility genes and thus decreases bacterial blight symptoms. Suppression or mutation of TFIIAγ5 can also reduce bacterial streak, another devastating disease of rice caused by TALE-carrying X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. These results have important implications for formulating a widely applicable strategy with which to improve resistance of plants to TALE-carrying pathogens.
27471511	Physiological Mechanisms Underlying the High-Grain Yield and High-Nitrogen Use Efficiency of Elite Rice Varieties under a Low Rate of Nitrogen Application in China.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Selecting rice varieties with a high nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) is the best approach to reduce N fertilizer application in rice production and is one of the objectives of the Green Super Rice (GSR) Project in China. However, the performance of elite candidate GSR varieties under low N supply remains unclear. In the present study, differences in the grain yield and NUE of 13 and 14 candidate varieties with two controls were determined at a N rate of 100 kg ha(-1) in field experiments in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The grain yield for all of the rice varieties ranged from 8.67 to 11.09 t ha(-1), except for a japonica rice variety YG29, which had a grain yield of 6.42 t ha(-1). HY549 and YY4949 produced the highest grain yield, reflecting a higher biomass production and harvest index in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Total N uptake at maturity (TNPM) ranged from 144 to 210 kg ha(-1), while the nitrogen use efficiency for grain production (NUEg) ranged from 35.2 to 62.0 kg kg(-1). Both TNPM and NUEg showed a significant quadratic correlation with grain yield, indicating that it is possible to obtain high grain yield and NUEg with the reduction of TNPM. The correlation between N-related parameters and yield-related traits suggests that promoting pre-heading growth could increase TNPM, while high biomass accumulation during the grain filling period and large panicles are important for a higher NUEg. In addition, there were significant and negative correlations between the NUEg and N concentrations in leaf, stem, and grain tissues at maturity. Further improvements in NUEg require a reduction in the stem N concentration but not the leaf N concentration. The daily grain yield was the only parameter that significantly and positively correlated with both TNPMand NUEg. This study determined variations in the grain yield and NUE of elite candidate GSR rice varieties and provided plant traits that could be used as selection criteria in breeding N-efficient rice varieties.
27423220	Identification of structural elements involved in fine-tuning of the transport activity of the rice ammonium transporter OsAMT1;3.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Ammonium transporters (AMTs) are major routes for plant uptake of the NH4+-form nitrogen. Plant AMTs mediate predominantly the uptake of NH4+ and to a lesser extent, its organic analog methylammonium (MeA+). Mutagenesis studies on potential phosphorylation residues have achieved solid recognition that alteration of the phosphorylation status can result in allosteric regulation and impair the functionality of plant AMTs. However, molecular insights to the fine-tuning of a functional ammonium transporter remain less clear. In this report, we demonstrate that the rice root expressed OsAMT1;3 (Oryza sativa ammonium transporter 1;3) functions as a typical high-affinity NH4+ transporter and is weakly permeable to MeA+ using growth assays in NH4+ uptake defective yeast cells and electrophysiological measurements in Xenopus oocytes. Upon screening of six point mutations generated with the transporter, we identified two amino acid residues involved in the functional modulation of OsAMT1;3. The H199E mutation caused loss of transport activity whereas other five mutations retained the functionality of OsAMT1;3. Furthermore, the L56F mutation enabled respectively 5- and 3.5 -fold increased capability for NH4+ and MeA+ uptake with several-fold decreased affinity (Km) and accelerated Vmax values. Surprisingly, yeast cells expressing the L56F mutation shown increased Na+ toxicity leading to a speculation that enhanced Na+ permeation occurred with this mutation. The phenomenon was further supported by the observation of significant Na+ uptake current in oocytes. Our results seemingly support a speculation that the L56F mutation of OsAMT1;3 widens the substrate passage tunnel and allows enhanced permeability to NH4+ and larger ions MeA+ and Na+.
27374612	Comprehensive analysis of microRNA-Seq and target mRNAs of rice sheath blight pathogen provides new insights into pathogenic regulatory mechanisms.	2016	DNA Res	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for degradation or inhibiting protein translation. To investigate whether miRNAs regulate the pathogenesis in necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA, which causes significant yield loss in main economically important crops, and to determine the regulatory mechanism occurring during pathogenesis, we constructed hyphal small RNA libraries from six different infection periods of the rice leaf. Through sequencing and analysis, 177 miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) were identified, including 15 candidate pathogenic novel milRNAs predicted by functional annotations of their target mRNAs and expression patterns of milRNAs and mRNAs during infection. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction results for randomly selected milRNAs demonstrated that our novel comprehensive predictions had a high level of accuracy. In our predicted pathogenic protein-protein interaction network of R. solani, we added the related regulatory milRNAs of these core coding genes into the network, and could understand the relationships among these regulatory factors more clearly at the systems level. Furthermore, the putative pathogenic Rhi-milR-16, which negatively regulates target gene expression, was experimentally validated to have regulatory functions by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Additionally, 23 candidate rice miRNAs that may involve in plant immunity against R. solani were discovered. This first study on novel pathogenic milRNAs of R. solani AG1 IA and the recognition of target genes involved in pathogenicity, as well as rice miRNAs, participated in defence against R. solani could provide new insights into revealing the pathogenic mechanisms of the severe rice sheath blight disease.
27453497	A consortium of non-rhizobial endophytic microbes from Typha angustifolia functions as probiotic in rice and improves nitrogen metabolism.	2016	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Endophytic microbes isolated from plants growing in nutrient-deficient environments often possess properties that improve nutrition of agriculturally important plants. A consortium of non-rhizobial endophytic microbes isolated from a macrophyte Typha angustifolia growing in the marginal wetlands associated with a Uranium mine was characterized for their beneficial effect on rice and the mechanisms of growth promotion were investigated. The microbes were identified and characterized for their potential plant growth promoting (PGP) properties. Effect of these microbes on nitrogen (N)-metabolism of rice was tested as Typha endophytes were predominantly (N)-fixing. Relative N-use efficiency and expression of genes involved in N-uptake and assimilation were investigated in treated plants. Evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of dinitrogen reductase gene was observed within the consortium from a Pseudomonas stutzeri strain. The consortium behaved as plant probiotic and showed substantial growth benefits to Typha, their natural host as well as to rice. Typha endophytes colonized rice endosphere significantly increasing biomass, shoot length and chlorophyll content in rice plants both under N-sufficient and N-deficient conditions. N-uptake and assimilation genes were upregulated in plants treated with the endophytes even after three weeks post infection. Our results suggested, HGT of nitrogen-fixation trait to be highly prevalent among endophytes isolated from nutrient-poor habitats of the uranium mine. A long-term nitrogen deficiency response in the treated plants was elicited by the consortium improving N-uptake, assimilation and relative N-use efficiency of rice plants. This appeared to be at least one of the main strategies of plant growth promotion.
27415007	Tracing QTLs for Leaf Blast Resistance and Agronomic Performance of Finger Millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) Genotypes through Association Mapping and in silico Comparative Genomics Analyses.	2016	PLoS One	Finger millet is one of the small millets with high nutritive value. This crop is vulnerable to blast disease caused by Pyricularia grisea, which occurs annually during rainy and winter seasons. Leaf blast occurs at early crop stage and is highly damaging. Mapping of resistance genes and other quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic performance can be of great use for improving finger millet genotypes. Evaluation of one hundred and twenty-eight finger millet genotypes in natural field conditions revealed that leaf blast caused severe setback on agronomic performance for susceptible genotypes, most significant traits being plant height and root length. Plant height was reduced under disease severity while root length was increased. Among the genotypes, IE4795 showed superior response in terms of both disease resistance and better agronomic performance. A total of seven unambiguous QTLs were found to be associated with various agronomic traits including leaf blast resistance by association mapping analysis. The markers, UGEP101 and UGEP95, were strongly associated with blast resistance. UGEP98 was associated with tiller number and UGEP9 was associated with root length and seed yield. Cross species validation of markers revealed that 12 candidate genes were associated with 8 QTLs in the genomes of grass species such as rice, foxtail millet, maize, Brachypodium stacei, B. distachyon, Panicum hallii and switchgrass. Several candidate genes were found proximal to orthologous sequences of the identified QTLs such as 1,4-β-glucanase for leaf blast resistance, cytokinin dehydrogenase (CKX) for tiller production, calmodulin (CaM) binding protein for seed yield and pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) for root growth and development. Most of these QTLs and their putatively associated candidate genes are reported for first time in finger millet. On validation, these novel QTLs may be utilized in future for marker assisted breeding for the development of fungal resistant and high yielding varieties of finger millet.
27416927	Knock out of the PHOSPHATE 2 Gene TaPHO2-A1 Improves Phosphorus Uptake and Grain Yield under Low Phosphorus Conditions in Common Wheat.	2016	Sci Rep	MiR399 and its target PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2) play pivotal roles in phosphate signaling in plants. Loss of function mutation in PHO2 leads to excessive Pi accumulation in shoots and growth retardation in diploid plants like Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). Here we isolated three PHO2 homologous genes TaPHO2-A1, -B1 and -D1 from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). These TaPHO2 genes all contained miR399-binding sites and were able to be degraded by tae-miR399. TaPHO2-D1 was expressed much more abundantly than TaPHO2-A1 and -B1. The ion beam-induced deletion mutants were used to analyze the effects of TaPHO2s on phosphorus uptake and plant growth. The tapho2-a1, tapho2-b1 and tapho2-d1 mutants all had significant higher leaf Pi concentrations than did the wild type, with tapho2-d1 having the strongest effect, and tapho2-b1 the weakest. Two consecutive field experiments showed that knocking out TaPHO2-D1 reduced plant height and grain yield under both low and high phosphorus conditions. However, knocking out TaPHO2-A1 significantly increased phosphorus uptake and grain yield under low phosphorus conditions, with no adverse effect on grain yield under high phosphorus conditions. Our results indicated that TaPHO2s involved in phosphorus uptake and translocation, and molecular engineering TaPHO2 shows potential in improving wheat yield with less phosphorus fertilizer.
27478742	Expression of a mitochondrial gene orfH79 from CMS-Honglian rice inhibits Escherichia coli growth via deficient oxygen consumption.	2016	Springerplus	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has often been associated with abnormal mitochondrial open frames (ORF), orfH79 is a mitochondrial chimeric gene responsible for the CMS trait in Honglian (HL) rice. In this study, the weakly produced ORFH79 protein significantly inhibited the growth of E. coli in an oxygen culture, however, the growth of the transformants producing ORFH79 was indistinguishable from the control under anaerobic incubation conditions. In addition, a lower respiration rate, wrinkled bacterial surfaces, and decreased pyruvate kinase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activities were observed in the ORFH79 produced E. coli. These results indicate that ORFH79 impairs the oxygen respiration of E. coli, which may inhibit E. coli growth.
27459060	Brassinosteroid/Abscisic Acid Antagonism in Balancing Growth and Stress.	2016	Dev Cell	In this issue of Developmental Cell, Gui et al. (2016) show that an abscisic acid-inducible remorin protein in rice directly interacts with critical brassinosteroid signaling components to attenuate the brassinosteroid response, thus illuminating one aspect of the brassinosteroid/abscisic acid antagonism.
27373308	Nucleotide diversity, natural variation, and evolution of Flexible culm-1 and Strong culm-2 lodging resistance genes in rice.	2016	Genome	Lodging resistance is one of the vital traits in yield improvement and sustainability. Culm wall thickness, diameter, and strength are different traits that can govern the lodging resistance in rice. The genes SCM2 and FC1 have been isolated for culm thickness, strength, and flexibility, but their functional nucleotide variations were still unknown. We used a 13× deep sequence of 795 diverse genotypes to present the functional variation and SNP diversity in SCM2 and FC1. The major functional variant for the SCM2 gene was at position 27480181 and for the FC1 gene at position 31072992. Haplotype analysis of both genes provided their various allelic differences among haplotypes. SCM2 alleles further presented the evolution of Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica and subsp. japonica genomes from common parent in different geographical zones, while the haplotypes of FC1 suggested their evolution from different strains of the common parent Oryza rufipogon. SCM2 showed purifying selection and functional associations with rare alleles, while FC1 displayed balanced selection favored by multiple heterozygous alleles. Genotypes with an allelic combination of SCM2-3 and FC1-2 in japonica background exhibited striking resistance against lodging, which can be used in further breeding programs.
27411911	The sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase 2 gene SAPK9 improves drought tolerance and grain yield in rice by modulating cellular osmotic potential, stomatal closure and stress-responsive gene expression.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Family members of sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase 2 (SnRK2), being plant-specific serine/threonine protein kinases, constitute the central core of abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathways, and are key regulators of abiotic stress adaptation in plants. We report here the functional characterization of SAPK9 gene, one of the 10 SnRK2s of rice, through developing gain-of-function and loss-of-function phenotypes by transgenesis.

RESULTS: The gene expression profiling revealed that the abundance of single gene-derived SAPK9 transcript was significantly higher in drought-tolerant rice genotypes than the drought-sensitive ones, and its expression was comparatively greater in reproductive stage than the vegetative stage. The highest expression of SAPK9 gene in drought-tolerant Oryza rufipogon prompted us to clone and characterise the CDS of this allele in details. The SAPK9 transcript expression was found to be highest in leaf and upregulated during drought stress and ABA treatment. In silico homology modelling of SAPK9 with Arabidopsis OST1 protein showed the bilobal kinase fold structure of SAPK9, which upon bacterial expression was able to phosphorylate itself, histone III and OsbZIP23 as substrates in vitro. Transgenic overexpression (OE) of SAPK9 CDS from O. rufipogon in a drought-sensitive indica rice genotype exhibited significantly improved drought tolerance in comparison to transgenic silencing (RNAi) lines and non-transgenic (NT) plants. In contrast to RNAi and NT plants, the enhanced drought tolerance of OE lines was concurrently supported by the upgraded physiological indices with respect to water retention capacity, soluble sugar and proline content, stomatal closure, membrane stability, and cellular detoxification. Upregulated transcript expressions of six ABA-dependent stress-responsive genes and increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA of OE lines indicate that the SAPK9 is a positive regulator of ABA-mediated stress signaling pathways in rice. The yield-related traits of OE lines were augmented significantly, which resulted from the highest percentage of fertile pollens in OE lines when compared with RNAi and NT plants.

CONCLUSION: The present study establishes the functional role of SAPK9 as transactivating kinase and potential transcriptional activator in drought stress adaptation of rice plant. The SAPK9 gene has potential usefulness in transgenic breeding for improving drought tolerance and grain yield in crop plants.
27430511	Co-transformation of canola by chimeric chitinase and tlp genes towards improving resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.	2016	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Canola (Brassica napus) plants were co-transformed with two pathogenesis-related protein genes expressing a Trichoderma atroviride chitinase with a chitin-binding domain (chimeric chitinase) and a thaumatin-like protein (tlp) from Oryza sativa conferring resistance to phytopatogenic fungi by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The putative transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR. After measuring the specific activity of the chimeric chitinase and glucanase activity for tlp genes, transgenic plants with high specific activity were selected for southern blot analysis to confirm the copy number of the genes. In vitro assays, the antifungal activity of crude extracted protein against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum showed that the inhibition percentage in double transgenic plants was between 55 and 62, whereas the inhibition percentage in single-gene transformants (chimeric chitinase) ranged from 35 to 45 percent. Importantly, in greenhouse conditions, the double transgenic plants showed significant resistance than the single-gene transformant and wild type plants. The results in T2 generation using the intact leaf inoculation method showed that the average lesion diameters were 10, 14.7 and 29 mm for the double transformant, single-gene transformant and non-transgenic plants, respectively. Combined expression of chimeric chitinase and tlp in transgenic plants showed significantly enhanced resistance against S. sclerotiorum than the one that express single-gene transformant plants. These results suggest that the co-expression of chimeric chitinase and tlp can confer enhanced disease resistance in canola plant.
27369289	Lodging Resistance of Japonica Rice (Oryza Sativa L.): Morphological and Anatomical Traits due to top-Dressing Nitrogen Application Rates.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Lodging in rice production often limits grain yield and quality by breaking or bending stems. Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates are the cause of poor lodging resistance in rice, but little is known about the effect of top-dressing N application rates on the mechanical strength of japonica rice plants, especially how the anatomical structure in culms is affected by N. In this study, field experiments on two japonica rice varieties with three top-dressing N application rates, 0 kg N ha(-1) (LN), 135 kg N ha(-1) (MN), and 270 kg N ha(-1) (HN) as urea, were conducted. Wuyunjing23, a lodging-resistant japonica rice cultivar and W3668, a lodging-susceptible japonica rice cultivar were used. The lodging index, breaking strength, morphological and anatomical traits in culms were measured in this study.

RESULTS: The visual lodging rate in japonica rice differed remarkably between genotypes and top-dressing N treatments. The higher lodging index of rice plants was primarily attributed to the weak breaking strength of the lower internodes. The longer elongated basal internodes were responsible for higher plant height and a higher lodging index. Correlation analysis showed that breaking strength was significantly and positively correlated with the thickness of the mechanical tissue but was significantly and negatively correlated with the inner diameter of the major axis (b2). With increasing top-dressing N rates, the sclerenchyma cells of the mechanical tissues and the vascular bundles of the Wuyunjing23 cultivar varied little. The plant height, inner diameter of the minor axis (a2) and b2 increased significantly, but the area of the large vascular bundle (ALVB) and the area of the small vascular bundle (ASVB) decreased significantly and resulted in lower stem strength and a higher lodging index under higher top-dressing N conditions. The culm diameter of the W3668 cultivar increased slightly with no significant difference, and the sclerenchyma cells in the mechanical tissues and vascular bundles showed deficient lignifications under high top-dressing N conditions. Moreover, the ALVB and the ASVB decreased significantly, while the area of air chambers (AAC) increased rapidly.

CONCLUSIONS: An improvement in the lodging resistance of japonica rice plants could be achieved by reducing the length of the lower internodes, decreasing the inner culm diameter and developing a thicker mechanical tissue. Top-dressing N application increased the plant height and inner culm diameter and decreased the ALVB and the ASVB of the Wuyunjing23 cultivar and caused deficient lignified sclerenchyma cells, lowered the ALVB and the ASVB, and increased the AAC of the W3668 cultivar resulting in weaker stem strength and a higher lodging index.
27447945	Receptor-Like Kinase RUPO Interacts with Potassium Transporters to Regulate Pollen Tube Growth and Integrity in Rice.	2016	PLoS Genet	During sexual reproduction of flowering plants, the pollen tube grows fast and over a long distance within the pistil to deliver two sperms for double fertilization. Growing plant cells need to communicate constantly with external stimuli as well as monitor changes in surface tension of the cell wall and plasma membrane to coordinate these signals and internal growth machinery; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we show that the rice member of plant-specific receptor-like kinase CrRLK1Ls subfamily, Ruptured Pollen tube (RUPO), is specifically expressed in rice pollen. RUPO localizes to the apical plasma membrane and vesicle of pollen tubes and is required for male gamete transmission. K+ levels were greater in pollen of homozygous CRISPR-knockout lines than wild-type plants, and pollen tubes burst shortly after germination. We reveal the interaction of RUPO with high-affinity potassium transporters. Phosphorylation of RUPO established and dephosphorylation abolished the interaction. These results have revealed the receptor-like kinase as a regulator of high-affinity potassium transporters via phosphorylation-dependent interaction, and demonstrated a novel receptor-like kinase signaling pathway that mediates K+ homeostasis required for pollen tube growth and integrity.
27414796	Transcriptomic and Expression Analysis of the Salivary Glands in White-Backed Planthoppers, Sogatella furcifera.	2016	PLoS One	The white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), is one of the serious rice pests because of its destructive feeding. The salivary glands of the WBPH play an important role in the feeding behaviour. Currently, however, very little is known about the salivary glands at the molecular level. We sequenced the salivary gland transcriptome (sialotranscripome) of adult WBPHs using the Illumina sequencing. A total of 65,595 transcripts and 51,842 unigenes were obtained from salivary glands. According to annotations against the Nr database, many of the unigenes identified were associated with the most studied enzymes in hemipteran saliva. In the present study, we identified 32 salivary protein genes from the WBPH sialotranscripome, which were categorized as those involved in sugar metabolism, detoxification, suppression of plant defense responses, immunity-related responses, general digestion, and other phytophagy processes. Tissue expression profiles analysis revealed that four of 32 salivary protein genes (multicopper oxidase 4, multicopper oxidase 6, carboxylesterase and uridine phosphorylase 1 isform X2) were primarily expressed in the salivary gland, suggesting that they played putative role in insect-rice interactions. 13 of 32 salivary protein genes were primarily expressed in gut, which might play putative role in digestive and detoxify mechanism. Development expression profiles analysis revealed that the expression level of 26 of 32 salivary protein genes had no significant difference, suggesting that they may play roles in every developmental stages of salivary gland of WBPH. The other six genes have a high expression level in the salivary gland of adult. 31 of 32 genes (except putative acetylcholinesterase 1) have no significant difference in male and female adult, suggesting that their expression level have no difference between sexes. This report analysis of the sialotranscripome for the WBPH, and the transcriptome provides a foundational list of the genes involved in feeding. Our data will be useful to investigate the mechanisms of interaction between the WBPH and the host plant.
27440503	An Integrative Genetic Study of Rice Metabolism, Growth and Stochastic Variation Reveals Potential C/N Partitioning Loci.	2016	Sci Rep	Studying the genetic basis of variation in plant metabolism has been greatly facilitated by genomic and metabolic profiling advances. In this study, we use metabolomics and growth measurements to map QTL in rice, a major staple crop. Previous rice metabolism studies have largely focused on identifying genes controlling major effect loci. To complement these studies, we conducted a replicated metabolomics analysis on a japonica (Lemont) by indica (Teqing) rice recombinant inbred line population and focused on the genetic variation for primary metabolism. Using independent replicated studies, we show that in contrast to other rice studies, the heritability of primary metabolism is similar to Arabidopsis. The vast majority of metabolic QTLs had small to moderate effects with significant polygenic epistasis. Two metabolomics QTL hotspots had opposing effects on carbon and nitrogen rich metabolites suggesting that they may influence carbon and nitrogen partitioning, with one locus co-localizing with SUSIBA2 (WRKY78). Comparing QTLs for metabolomic and a variety of growth related traits identified few overlaps. Interestingly, the rice population displayed fewer loci controlling stochastic variation for metabolism than was found in Arabidopsis. Thus, it is possible that domestication has differentially impacted stochastic metabolite variation more than average metabolite variation.
27464824	CRR1 encoding callose synthase functions in ovary expansion by affecting vascular cell patterning in rice.	2016	Plant J	The ovary of rice undergoes rapid expansion immediately after fertilization, and this process determines the final sink strength potential of caryopses. To date, work on rice grain development has mainly focused on endosperm filling, whereas information on the essential elements for ovary expansion remains limited. We report here a functional analysis of the ovary expansion retarded mutant crr1 in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that CRR1 encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis callose synthases AtGSL8 and AtGSL10. Point mutation in crr1 resulted in alternative splicing, which led to the formation of the truncated crr1 protein without the β-glucan synthase domain. Iodine staining showed that there were few starch granules and these were unevenly distributed in the pericarp of crr1, and a 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate transport assay revealed that carbohydrates were less efficiently unloaded from the lateral vasculature into the developing caryopsis. CRR1 transcripts were detected in all plant organs, with the highest level found in receptacles, which are mainly composed of vascular tissues. Analysis of pCRR1::GUS transgenic plants showed that CRR1 was specifically expressed in vascular bundle cells. Consistently, loss of function of CRR1 led to disordered patterns of vascular cells in the ovaries and receptacles of the mutant. Furthermore, a small portion of cells in the vascular bundles of crr1 showed defective cell wall formation, and callose deposition was specifically reduced at the plasmodesmata (PD) of cells with aberrant walls. Our results suggest that CRR1 performs a pivotal role in determining initial ovary expansion in rice, possibly via the PD-mediated permeability of cell fate determinants for vascular cell differentiation.
27444416	No impact of transgenic cry1C rice on the rove beetle Paederus fuscipes, a generalist predator of brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2016	Sci Rep	T1C-19 is newly developed transgenic rice active against lepidopteran pests, and expresses a synthesized cry1C gene driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter. The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is a major non-target pest of rice, and the rove beetle (Paederus fuscipes) is a generalist predator of N. lugens nymphs. As P. fuscipes may be exposed to the Cry1C protein through preying on N. lugens, it is essential to assess the potential effects of transgenic cry1C rice on this predator. In this study, two experiments (a direct feeding experiment and a tritrophic experiment) were conducted to evaluate the ecological risk of cry1C rice to P. fuscipes. No significant negative effects were observed in the development, survival, female ratio and body weight of P. fuscipes in both treatments of direct exposure to elevated doses of Cry1C protein and prey-mediated exposure to realistic doses of the protein. This indicated that cry1C rice had no detrimental effects on P. fuscipes. This work represents the first study of an assessment continuum for the effects of transgenic cry1C rice on P. fuscipes. Use of the rove beetle as an indicator species to assess potential effects of genetically modified crops on non-target arthropods is feasible.
27434423	Cadmium uptake dynamics and translocation in rice seedling: Influence of different forms of selenium.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Selenium (Se) can alleviate the toxicity of cadmium (Cd), but little is known about its mechanism in Cd uptake and translocation in plants. We investigated the effects of exogenous selenite, selenate, and selenomethionine (SeMet) on Cd uptake and translocation within rice (Oryza sativa L., Zhunliangyou 608) seedlings, and the concentration-dependent uptake kinetics of Cd into rice roots (with or without Se) were determined. The effect of the endogenous Se pool on Cd uptake was also investigated. Results of uptake kinetics showed that selenite slightly promoted Cd influx during 1h of exposure, compared with no selenite addition; Vmax of Cd uptake increased by 13.8% in 10μM selenite treatment; while the presence of selenate had no effect on the influx of Cd. When exposed to Cd (5μM) over 20h (with selenite) or 30h (with selenate or SeMet), Se addition (5μM) decreased Cd uptake and root-to-shoot translocation; after 30h selenite, selenate, or SeMet addition decreased Cd uptake by roots by 28.6%, 17.7% or 12.1%, respectively. Besides, as the selenite levels in the treatment solutions (1μMCd) increased (0, 0.1, 1, and 5μM, Se), Cd uptake and translocation were both significantly reduced, while the inhibitive effect was more significant at lower levels of selenate. Pretreatment of selenite or selenate (5μM) also decreased Cd uptake by 24.9% or 15.7%, and reduced the root-to-shoot transfer factor by 41.4% or 36.2% after 144h of subjection to Cd (5μM), respectively. The presence of selenite decreased Cd content more effectively than did selenate. Our results demonstrated that Se can effectively reduce the Cd translocation from roots to shoots in rice seedlings.
27380139	Quantitative trait loci identification and meta-analysis for rice panicle-related traits.	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Rice yield is a complex trait controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In the past three decades, thousands of QTLs for rice yield traits have been detected, but only a very small percentage has been cloned to date, as identifying the QTL genes requires a substantial investment of time and money. Meta-analysis provides a simple, reliable, and economical method for integrating information from multiple QTL studies across various environmental and genetic backgrounds, detecting consistent QTLs powerfully and estimating their genetic positions precisely. In this study, we aimed to locate consistent QTL regions associated with rice panicle traits by applying a genome-wide QTL meta-analysis approach. We first conducted a QTL analysis of 5 rice panicle traits using 172 plants in 2011 and 138 plants in 2012 from an F2 population derived from a cross between Nipponbare and H71D rice cultivators. A total of 54 QTLs were detected, and these were combined with 1085 QTLs collected from 82 previous studies to perform a meta-analysis using BioMercator v4.2. The integration of 82 maps resulted in a consensus map with 6970 markers and a total map length of 1823.1 centimorgan (cM), on which 837 QTLs were projected. These QTLs were then integrated into 87 meta-quantitative trait loci (MQTLs) by meta-analysis, and the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of them were smaller than the mean value of the original QTLs. Also, 30 MQTLs covered 47 of the 54 QTLs detected from the cross between Nipponbare and H71D in this study. Among them, the two major and stable QTLs, spp10.1 and sd10.1, were found to be included in MQTL10.4. The three other major QTLs, pl3.1, sb2.1, and sb10.1, were included in MQTL3.3, MQTL2.2, and MQTL10.3, respectively. A total of 21 of the 87 MQTLs' phenotypic variation were >20 %. In total, 24 candidate genes were found in 15 MQTLs that spanned physical intervals <0.2 Mb, including genes that have been cloned previously, e.g., EP3, LP, MIP1, HTD1, DSH1, and OsPNH1. However, it would be beneficial to identify a greater number of candidate genes from these MQTLs. Mining new genes that modulate yield and its related traits would assist researchers to better understand the relevant molecular mechanisms. The MQTLs found in this study that have small physical and genetic intervals are useful not only for marker-assisted selection and pyramiding, but they also provide important information of rice yield and related gene mining for future research.
27412613	Genetic diversity and structure in hill rice (Oryza sativa L.) landraces from the North-Eastern Himalayas of India.	2016	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Hill rices (Oryza sativa L.) are direct seeded rices grown on hill slopes of different gradients. These landraces have evolved under rainfed and harsh environmental conditions and may possess genes governing adaptation traits such as tolerance to cold and moisture stress. In this study, 64 hill rice landraces were collected from the state of Arunachal Pradesh of North-Eastern region of India, and assessed by agro-morphological variability and microsatellite markers polymorphism. Our aim was to use phenotypic and genetic diversity data to understand the basis of farmers' classification of hill rice landraces into two groups: umte and tening. Another goal was to understand the genetic differentiation of hill rices into Indica or japonica subspecies.

RESULTS: According to farmers' classification, hill rices were categorized into two groups: umte (large-grained, late maturing) and tening (small-grained, early maturing). We did not find significant difference in days to 50 % flowering between the groups. Principal component analysis revealed that two groups can be distinguished on the basis of kernel length-to-width ration (KLW), kernel length (KL), grain length (GrL), grain length-to-width ration (GrLW) and plant height (Ht). Stepwise canonical discriminant analysis identified KL and Ht as the main discriminatory characters between the cultivar groups. Genetic diversity analysis with 35 SSR markers revealed considerable genetic diversity in the hill rice germplasm (gene diversity: 0.66; polymorphism information content: 0.62). Pair-wise allelic difference between umte and tening groups was not statistically significant. The model-based population structure analysis showed that the hill rices were clustered into two broad groups corresponding to Indica and Japonica. The geographic distribution and cultivars grouping of hill rices were not congruent in genetic clusters. Both distance- and model-based approaches indicated that the hill rices were predominantly japonica or admixture among the groups within the subspecies. These findings were further supported by combined analysis hill rices with 150 reference rice accessions representing major genetic groups of rice.

CONCLUSION: This study collected a valuable set of hill rice germplasm for rice breeding and for evolutionary studies. It also generated a new set of information on genetic and phenotypic diversity of hill rice landraces in North-Eastern region of India. The collected hill rices were mostly japonica or admixture among the subpopulations of Indica or Japonica. The findings are useful for utilization and conservation of hill rice germplasm.
27269510	Action of Multiple Cell Wall-Degrading Enzymes Is Required for Elicitation of Innate Immune Responses During Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Infection in Rice.	2016	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae secretes a number of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) whose purified preparations induce defense responses in rice. These defense responses are suppressed by X. oryzae pv. oryzae using type 3 secretion system (T3SS) effectors and a type 3 secretion system mutant (T3SS(-)) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is an inducer of rice defense responses. We assessed the role of individual CWDEs in induction of rice defense responses during infection, by mutating them in the genetic background of a T3SS(-). We mutated the genes for five different plant CWDEs secreted by X. oryzae pv. oryzae, including two cellulases (clsA and cbsA), one xylanase (xyn), one pectinase (pglA), and an esterase (lipA), singly in a T3SS(-) background. We have demonstrated that, as compared with a T3SS(-) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, a cbsA(-)T3SS(-), a clsA(-)T3SS(-), and a xyn(-)T3SS(-) are deficient in induction of rice immune responses such as callose deposits and programmed cell death. In comparison, a lipA(-) T3SS(-) and a pglA(-)T3SS(-) is as efficient in induction of host defense responses as a T3SS(-). Overall, these results indicate that the collective action of X. oryzae pv. oryzae-secreted ClsA, CbsA, and Xyn proteins is required for induction of rice defense responses during infection.
27454201	Molecular characterization and targeted quantitative profiling of the sphingolipidome in rice.	2016	Plant J	Recent advances in comprehensive metabolite profiling techniques, the foundation of metabolomics, is facilitating our understanding of the functions, regulation and complex networks of various metabolites in organisms. Here, we report a quantitative metabolomics technique for complex plant sphingolipids, composed of various polar head groups as well as structural isomers of hydrophobic ceramide moieties. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) was used as an experimental model of monocotyledonous plants and has been demonstrated to possess a highly complex sphingolipidome including hundreds of molecular species with a wide range of abundance. We established a high-throughput scheme for lipid preparation and mass spectrometry-based characterization of complex sphingolipid structures, which provided basic information to create a comprehensive theoretical library for targeted quantitative profiling of complex sphingolipids in rice. The established sphingolipidomic approach combined with multivariate analyses of the large dataset obtained clearly showed that different classes of rice sphingolipids, particularly including subclasses of glycosylinositol phosphoceramide with various sugar-chain head groups, are distributed with distinct quantitative profiles in various rice tissues, indicating tissue-dependent metabolism and biological functions of the lipid classes and subclasses. The sphingolipidomic analysis also highlighted that disruption of a lipid-associated gene causes a typical sphingolipidomic change in a gene-dependent manner. These results clearly support the utility of the sphingolipidomic approach in application to wide screening of sphingolipid-metabolic phenotypes as well as deeper investigation of metabolism and biological functions of complex sphingolipid species in plants.
27454702	Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Rice Resistance Genes Against Magnaporthe oryzae Isolates from Four African Countries.	2016	Phytopathology	Rice blast disease is emerging as a major constraint to rice production in Africa. Although a traditional gene-tagging strategy using biparental crosses can effectively identify resistance (R) genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) against Magnaporthe oryzae, the mapping procedure required is time consuming and requires many populations to investigate the genetics of resistance. In this report, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to rapidly map rice genes conferring resistance against eight M. oryzae isolates from four African countries. We inoculated 162 rice cultivars, which were part of the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) and were previously genotyped with the 44,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, with the eight isolates. The GWAS identified 31 genomic regions associated with blast resistance (RABR) in the rice genome. In addition, we used polymerase chain reaction analysis to confirm the association between the Pish gene and a major RABR on chromosome 1 that was associated with resistance to four M. oryzae isolates. Our study has demonstrated the power of GWAS for the rapid identification of rice blast R or QTL genes that are effective against African populations of M. oryzae. The identified SNP markers associated with RABR can be used in breeding for resistance against rice blast in Africa.
27525873	Identification of QTLs for resistant starch and total alkaloid content in brown and polished rice.	2016	Genet Mol Res	An F3 population consisting of 117 F2:3 families derived from a cross between two varieties of rice, Gongmi No. 3 and Diantun 502, with a large difference in their resistant starch and total alkaloid content, was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Two QTLs of resistant starch for rice (qRS7-1, qRS7-2) were identified in a linkage group on chromosome 7, which could explain phenotypic variance from 7.6 to 17.3%, due to additive effects for resistant starch from Gongmi No. 3 or over-dominance effects for qRS7-2 of the marker interval (RM3404-RM478) on chromosome 7 from Gongmi No. 3, accounting for 13.8-17.3% of the phenotypic variance. Two QTLs of total alkaloids for brown rice (qALb7-1, qALb7-2) were identified in the same linkage group, which could explain phenotypic variance from 7.7 and 19.3%, respectively, due to dominance or over-dominance effects for total alkaloids on chromosome 7 from Diantun 502. To our knowledge, these are the first QTLs to be identified, which are related to resistant starch and total alkaloid content in rice. These results are beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of, as well as for developing markers linked with, resistant starch and total alkaloids of functional components for marker-assisted selection breeding in rice.
27458473	Comparison between Arabidopsis and Rice for Main Pathways of K(+) and Na(+) Uptake by Roots.	2016	Front Plant Sci	K(+) is an essential macronutrient for plants. It is acquired by specific uptake systems located in roots. Although the concentrations of K(+) in the soil solution are widely variable, K(+) nutrition is secured by uptake systems that exhibit different affinities for K(+). Two main systems have been described for root K(+) uptake in several species: the high-affinity HAK5-like transporter and the inward-rectifier AKT1-like channel. Other unidentified systems may be also involved in root K(+) uptake, although they only seem to operate when K(+) is not limiting. The use of knock-out lines has allowed demonstrating their role in root K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis and rice. Plant adaptation to the different K(+) supplies relies on the finely tuned regulation of these systems. Low K(+)-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the genes encoding HAK5-like transporters occurs through a signal cascade that includes changes in the membrane potential of root cells and increases in ethylene and reactive oxygen species concentrations. Activation of AKT1 channels occurs through phosphorylation by the CIPK23/CBL1 complex. Recently, activation of the Arabidopsis HAK5 by the same complex has been reported, pointing to CIPK23/CBL as a central regulator of the plant's adaptation to low K(+). Na(+) is not an essential plant nutrient but it may be beneficial for some plants. At low concentrations, Na(+) improves growth, especially under K(+) deficiency. Thus, high-affinity Na(+) uptake systems have been described that belong to the HKT and HAK families of transporters. At high concentrations, typical of saline environments, Na(+) accumulates in plant tissues at high concentrations, producing alterations that include toxicity, water deficit and K(+) deficiency. Data concerning pathways for Na(+) uptake into roots under saline conditions are still scarce, although several possibilities have been proposed. The apoplast is a significant pathway for Na(+) uptake in rice grown under salinity conditions, but in other plant species different mechanisms involving non-selective cation channels or transporters are under discussion.
27553634	Rolling-circle amplification of centromeric Helitrons in plant genomes.	2016	Plant J	The unusual eukaryotic Helitron transposons can readily capture host sequences and are, thus, evolutionarily important. They are presumed to amplify by rolling-circle replication (RCR) because some elements encode predicted proteins homologous to RCR prokaryotic transposases. In support of this replication mechanism, it was recently shown that transposition of a bat Helitron generates covalently closed circular intermediates. Another strong prediction is that RCR should generate tandem Helitron concatemers, yet almost all Helitrons identified to date occur as solo elements in the genome. To investigate alternative modes of Helitron organization in present-day genomes, we have applied the novel computational tool HelitronScanner to 27 plant genomes and have uncovered numerous tandem arrays of partially decayed, truncated Helitrons in all of them. Strikingly, most of these Helitron tandem arrays are interspersed with other repeats in centromeres. Many of these arrays have multiple Helitron 5' ends, but a single 3' end. The number of repeats in any one array can range from a handful to several hundreds. We propose here an RCR model that conforms to the present Helitron landscape of plant genomes. Our study provides strong evidence that plant Helitrons amplify by RCR and that the tandemly arrayed replication products accumulate mostly in centromeres.
27540108	Dissimilar Manifestation of Heterosis in Superhybrid Rice at Early-Tillering Stage under Nutrient-Deficient and Nutrient-Sufficient Condition.	2016	Plant Physiol	Heterosis has long been exploited for crop breeding; however, the genetic mechanisms, particularly the initial establishment of heterosis during the early vegetative growth phase, remain elusive. The biggest challenge for that is to exclude noise genes from the identified heterosis-related candidates. Herein, we use nutrient-deficient hybrid with no measurable growth heterosis as control. After filtering these irrelevant genes, only 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which is significantly lower than in previous reports, were identified as heterosis-related genes in a superhybrid rice of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu (LYP9) at early-tillering stage. Among the DEGs that could be mapped to quantitative trait loci (QTL), approximately 72.8% could be covered by yield or growth vigor-related QTL, thereby suggesting that our DEGs were reliable and may have potential value to rice breeding. Among the 336 DEGs identified, a majority showed intermediate expression relative to that of its parental lines (i.e. additive effects), particularly, expression was frequently more similar to the paternal line rather than the maternal line (44.1% versus 32.7%); the remaining 27.1% were exclusively up- or down-regulated between the hybrid and either parent. Interestingly, up-regulated genes encoded various enzymes, whereas down-regulated genes were enriched in responses to stress, indicating that hybrids may benefit from both activating metabolism-related pathways and alleviating fitness cost through allelic interactions. Furthermore, a significantly larger proportion of divergent genes and higher nonsynonymous substitutions rates were detected in these DEGs, suggesting a potential contribution to the establishment of heterosis in superhybrid rice LYP9.
27494320	Population Structure, Genetic Diversity and Molecular Marker-Trait Association Analysis for High Temperature Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Rice exhibits enormous genetic diversity, population structure and molecular marker-traits associated with abiotic stress tolerance to high temperature stress. A set of breeding lines and landraces representing 240 germplasm lines were studied. Based on spikelet fertility percent under high temperature, tolerant genotypes were broadly classified into four classes. Genetic diversity indicated a moderate level of genetic base of the population for the trait studied. Wright's F statistic estimates showed a deviation of Hardy-Weinberg expectation in the population. The analysis of molecular variance revealed 25 percent variation between population, 61 percent among individuals and 14 percent within individuals in the set. The STRUCTURE analysis categorized the entire population into three sub-populations and suggested that most of the landraces in each sub-population had a common primary ancestor with few admix individuals. The composition of materials in the panel showed the presence of many QTLs representing the entire genome for the expression of tolerance. The strongly associated marker RM547 tagged with spikelet fertility under stress and the markers like RM228, RM205, RM247, RM242, INDEL3 and RM314 indirectly controlling the high temperature stress tolerance were detected through both mixed linear model and general linear model TASSEL analysis. These markers can be deployed as a resource for marker-assisted breeding program of high temperature stress tolerance.
27575481	Synthesis and biological activities of novel 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole Mannich bases and bis-Mannich bases as ketol-acid reductoisomerase inhibitors.	2016	Bioorg Med Chem Lett	A series of novel 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole Mannich bases and bis-Mannich bases have been conveniently synthesized in good yields. Their structures were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. The preliminary bioassay results indicated that some of the compounds showed promising in vitro fungicidal activities towards several test plant fungi; some of them exhibited significant herbicidal activities against Brassica campestris and excellent in vitro inhibitory activities against rice ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI). Among 14 novel compounds, 8c, 8d and 8m showed potent KARI inhibitory activities with Ki value of (0.96±0.42), (3.86±0.49) and (3.10±0.71) μmol/L, respectively, and were comparable with IpOHA. These compounds could be novel KARI inhibitors for further investigation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular docking were carried out to study the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the active inhibitors in this Letter.
27492010	Analyses of genetic diversity of bacterial blight pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae using IS1112 in Bangladesh.	None	C R Biol	Bacterial blight (BB) is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a most destructive disease of rice, mostly in Asia, including Bangladesh. Altogether 96 isolates of Xoo were collected from 19 rice-growing districts of Bangladesh in both the rain-fed and irrigated seasons of 2014 to assess their pathotypic and genetic variation. Pathotypic analyses were carried out on a set of 12 Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) of rice containing a single resistance gene and two check varieties IR24 and TN1 by the leaf clipping inoculation method. A total of 24 pathotypes were identified based on their virulence patterns on the NILs tested. Among these, pathotypes VII, XII and XIV, considered as major, containing a maximum number of isolates (9.38% each), are frequently distributed in seven northern to mid-eastern districts of Bangladesh. The most virulent pathotype I was recorded in the Habiganj and Brahmanbaria districts. The molecular analysis of variability among the isolates was carried out through PCR analysis using multi-locus primers Jel1 and Jel2 (based on the repetitive element IS1112 in the Xoo genome). Using the genotypic data, a dendrogram was constructed with 17 clusters along with 17 molecular haplotypes at the 65% similarity index. Cluster I was composed of 46 isolates considered as major, whereas clusters X, XI, XII and XVII were represented by a single isolate. A phenogram was constructed based on virulence to interpret the relationship between the pathotypes and the molecular haplotypes. At the 50% similarity level, among 10 clusters, cluster I, considered as major, consisted of a maximum of 10 pathotypes out of 24. In case of haplotypes, a maximum of 7 haplotypes were obtained from pathotype XII, whereas pathotypes IX, X, XV, XXII and XXIV were represented by a single haplotype. However, the present study revealed that different isolates belonging to the same pathotypes belonged to different haplotypes. Conversely, genetically similar haplotypes were also detected from different pathotypes collected from separate districts. This relationship appeared due to a high degree of DNA polymorphism among strains within many pathotypes existing in Bangladesh.
27515683	High-efficiency CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex gene editing using the glycine tRNA-processing system-based strategy in maize.	2016	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy has been applied to a variety of species and the tRNA-processing system has been used to compact multiple gRNAs into one synthetic gene for manipulating multiple genes in rice.

RESULTS: We optimized and introduced the multiplex gene editing strategy based on the tRNA-processing system into maize. Maize glycine-tRNA was selected to design multiple tRNA-gRNA units for the simultaneous production of numerous gRNAs under the control of one maize U6 promoter. We designed three gRNAs for simplex editing and three multiple tRNA-gRNA units for multiplex editing. The results indicate that this system not only increased the number of targeted sites but also enhanced mutagenesis efficiency in maize. Additionally, we propose an advanced sequence selection of gRNA spacers for relatively more efficient and accurate chromosomal fragment deletion, which is important for complete abolishment of gene function especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our results also indicated that up to four tRNA-gRNA units in one expression cassette design can still work in maize.

CONCLUSIONS: The examples reported here demonstrate the utility of the tRNA-processing system-based strategy as an efficient multiplex genome editing tool to enhance maize genetic research and breeding.
27539357	Suppression of glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase induced arthritis by oral administration of transgenic rice seeds expressing altered peptide ligands of glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase.	2017	Mod Rheumatol	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of transgenic rice seeds expressing the altered peptide ligand (APL) of human glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase (hGPI325-339) in mice model of GPI-induced arthritis (GIA).

METHODS: We generated transgenic rice expressing T-cell epitope of hGPI325-339 and APL12 contained in the seed endosperm. The transgenic rice seeds were orally administered prophylactically before the induction of GIA. The severity of arthritis and titers of serum anti-GPI antibodies were evaluated. We examined for IL-17 production in splenocytes and inguinal lymph node (iLN) cells, and analyzed the expression levels of functional molecules in splenocytes.

RESULTS: Prophylactic treatment of GIA mice with APL12 transgenic (APL12-TG) rice seeds significantly reduced the severity of arthritis and titers of serum anti-GPI antibodies compared with non-transgenic (Non-TG) rice-treated mice. APL12-TG and hGPI325-339 transgenic (hGPI325-339-TG) rice seeds improved the histopathological arthritis scores and decreased IL-17 production compared with non-TG rice-treated mice. APL12-TG rice-treated GIA mice showed upregulation of Foxp3 and GITR protein in CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3+ cells in the spleen compared with non-TG rice- and hGPI325-339-TG rice-treated mice.

CONCLUSION: APL12-TG rice seeds improved the severity of GIA through a decrease in production of IL-17 and anti-GPI antibodies via upregulation of Foxp3 and GITR expression on Treg cells in spleen.
27522959	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	Leaves are a major site for photosynthesis and a key determinant of plant architecture. Rice produces thin and slender leaves, which consist of the leaf blade and leaf sheath separated by the lamina joint. Two types of vasculature, the large and small vascular bundles, run in parallel, together with a strong structure, the midrib. In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7. We backcrossed original mutants of these genes with the standard wild-type rice, Taichung 65. We then compared the effect of each mutation on similar genetic backgrounds and examined genetic interactions of these genes. The nal1 single mutation and the nal2 nal3 double mutation showed a severe effect on leaf width, resulting in very narrow leaves. Although vein number was also reduced in the nal1 and nal2 nal3 mutants, the small vein number was more strongly reduced than the large vein number. In contrast, the nal7 mutation showed a milder effect on leaf width and vein number, and both the large and small veins were similarly affected. Thus, the genes responsible for narrow leaf phenotype seem to play distinct roles. The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation. In addition, observations of inner tissues revealed that cell differentiation was partially compromised in the nal2 nal3 nal7 mutant, consistent with the severe reduction in leaf width in this triple mutant.
27525914	Genomic identification, phylogeny, and expression analysis of MLO genes involved in susceptibility to powdery mildew in Fragaria vesca.	2016	Genet Mol Res	The MLO (powdery mildew locus O) gene family is important in resistance to powdery mildew (PM). In this study, all of the members of the MLO family were identified and analyzed in the strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genome. The strawberry contains at least 20 members of the MLO family, and the protein sequence contained between 171 and 1485 amino acids, with 0-34 introns. Chromosomal localization showed that the MLOs were unevenly distributed on each of the chromosomes, except for chromosome 4. The greatest number of MLOs (seven) was found on chromosome 3. A phylogenetic tree showed that the MLOs were divided into seven groups (I-VII), four of which consisted of MLOs from strawberry, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and maize, suggesting that these genes may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. Multiple sequence alignment showed that strawberry MLO candidates related to powdery mildew resistance possessed seven highly conserved transmembrane domains, a calmodulin-binding domain, and two conserved regions, all of which are important domains for powdery mildew resistance genes. Expressed sequence tag analysis revealed that the MLOs were induced by multiple abiotic stressors, including low and high temperature, drought, and high salinity. These findings will contribute to the functional characterization of MLOs related to PM susceptibility, and will assist in the development of disease resistance in strawberries.
27468303	Ambient insect pressure and recipient genotypes determine fecundity of transgenic crop-weed rice hybrid progeny: Implications for environmental biosafety assessment.	2016	Evol Appl	Transgene introgression into crop weedy/wild relatives can provide natural selective advantages, probably causing undesirable environmental impact. The advantages are likely associated with factors such as transgenes, selective pressure, and genetic background of transgene recipients. To explore the role of the environment and background of transgene recipients in affecting the advantages, we estimated the fitness of crop-weed hybrid lineages derived from crosses between marker-free insect-resistant transgenic (Bt/CpTI) rice with five weedy rice populations under varied insect pressure. Multiway anova indicated the significant effect of both transgenes and weedy rice genotypes on the performance of crop-weed hybrid lineages in the high-insect environment. Increased fecundity was detected in most transgene-present F1 and F2 hybrid lineages under high-insect pressure, but varied among crop-weed hybrid lineages with different weedy rice parents. Increased fecundity of transgenic crop-weed hybrid lineages was associated with the environmental insect pressure and genotypes of their weedy rice parents. The findings suggest that the fitness effects of an insect-resistant transgene introgressed into weedy populations are not uniform across different environments and genotypes of the recipient plants that have acquired the transgene. Therefore, these factors should be considered when assessing the environmental impact of transgene flow to weedy or wild rice relatives.
27493141	Rice-produced MSP142 of Plasmodium falciparum elicits antibodies that inhibit parasite growth in vitro.	2016	Parasite Immunol	Many malaria antigens contain multiple disulphide bonds involved in the formation of inhibitory B-cell epitopes. Producing properly folded malaria antigens in sufficient quantities for vaccination is often a challenge. The 42-kDa fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP142 ) is such a kind of malaria antigen. In this study, we investigated the expression of MSP142 in a rice system (9522, a cultivar of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica), which was used as a bioreactor for protein production. The MSP142 gene was synthesized according to rice-preferred codons and transformed into rice plants via an Agrobacterium-mediated method. The recombinant antigen was efficiently expressed in rice seeds with a level up to 1.56% of total soluble protein and was recognized by both the conformational monoclonal antibody 5.2 (mAb5.2) and the pooled sera of P. falciparum malaria patients. Rabbits were immunized intramuscularly with the purified MSP142 formulated with Freund's adjuvant. High antibody titres against MSP142 were elicited. The rabbit immune sera reacted well with the native protein of P. falciparum parasite and strongly inhibited the in vitro growth of blood-stage P. falciparum parasites, demonstrating that transgenic rice can become an efficient bioreactor for the production of malaria vaccine antigens.
27565205	The Dual Roles of the Golgi Transport 1 (GOT1B): RNA Localization to the Cortical Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Export of Proglutelin and α-Globulin from the Cortical ER to the Golgi.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	The rice glup2 lines are characterized by their abnormally high levels of endosperm 57 kDa proglutelins and of the luminal chaperone binding protein (BiP), features characteristic of a defect within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To elucidate the underlying genetic basis, the glup2 locus was identified by map based cloning. DNA sequencing of the genomes of three glup2 alleles and wild type demonstrated that the underlying genetic basis was mutations in the Golgi transport 1 (GOT1B) coding sequence. This conclusion was further validated by restoration of normal proglutelin levels in a glup2 line complemented by a GOT1B gene. Microscopic analyses indicated the presence of proglutelin-α-globulin-containing intracisternal granules surrounded by prolamine inclusions within the ER lumen. As assessed by in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of developing endosperm sections, prolamine and α-globulin RNAs were found to be mis-targeted from their usual sites on the protein body ER to the cisternal ER, the normal sites of proglutelin synthesis. Our results indicate that GLUP2/GOT1B has a dual role during rice endosperm development. It is required for localization of prolamine and α-globulin RNAs to the protein body ER and for efficient export of proglutelin and α-globulin proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.
27522958	Polar patterning of the spikelet is disrupted in the two opposite lemma mutant in rice.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	Angiosperms produce diverse flowers and the pattern of floral symmetry is a major factor for flower diversification. Bilaterally symmetric flowers have evolved multiple times in different angiosperm lineages from radially symmetric ancestors. Whereas most monocots produce radially symmetric flowers, grasses such as rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) generate bilaterally symmetric flowers and spikelets. In this paper, we focused on the two opposite lemma (tol) mutant, which displays a pleiotropic phenotype in the spikelet. Close morphological examination revealed that a typical spikelet phenotype of the tol mutant was principally based on the mirror image duplication of the lemma-side half of the spikelet. Other spikelet phenotypes can be explained as the derivation from the spikelet with this duplication. A polar pattern of organ formation along the lemma-palea axis was disrupted by this duplication. Accordingly, tol mutation seems to change the spikelet from bilateral symmetry (monosymmetry) to disymmetry. Thus, the tol mutant provides good genetic material to investigate the regulation of spikelet symmetry in rice.
27538481	Glucosidase II β-subunit, a novel substrate for caspase-3-like activity in rice, plays as a molecular switch between autophagy and programmed cell death.	2016	Sci Rep	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy. However, prolonged, severe stresses activate programmed cell death (PCD) in both animal and plant cells. Compared to the well-studied UPR pathway, the molecular mechanisms of ER-stress-induced PCD are less understood. Here, we report the identification of Gas2, the glucosidase II β subunit in the ER, as a potential switch between PCD and autophagy in rice. MS analysis identified Gas2, GRP94, and HSP40 protein in a purified caspase-3-like activity from heat stressed rice cell suspensions. The three corresponding genes were down-regulated under DTT-induced ER stress. Gas2 and GRP94 were localized to the ER, while HSP40 localized to the cytoplasm. Compared to wild-type, a Gas2 RNAi cell line was much sensitive to DTT treatment and had high levels of autophagy. Both caspase-3 and heat-stressed cell suspension lysate could cleave Gas2, producing a 14 kDa N-terminal fragment. Conditional expression of corresponding C-terminal fragment resulted in enhanced caspase-3-like activity in the protoplasts under heat stress. We proposed that mild ER stress causes down-regulation of Gas2 and induces autophagy, while severe stress results in Gas2 cleavage by caspase-3-like activity and the cleavage product amplifies this activity, possibly participating in the initiation of PCD.
27530495	Biochar amendment immobilizes lead in rice paddy soils and reduces its phytoavailability.	2016	Sci Rep	This study aimed to determine effects of rice straw biochar on Pb sequestration in a soil-rice system. Pot experiments were conducted with rice plants in Pb-contaminated paddy soils that had been amended with 0, 2.5, and 5% (w/w) biochar. Compared to the control treatment, amendment with 5% biochar resulted in 54 and 94% decreases in the acid soluble and CaCl2-extractable Pb, respectively, in soils containing rice plants at the maturity stage. The amount of Fe-plaque on root surfaces and the Pb concentrations of the Fe-plaque were also reduced in biochar amended soils. Furthermore, lead species in rice roots were determined using Pb L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and although Pb-ferrihydrite complexes dominated Pb inventories, increasing amounts of organic complexes like Pb-pectins and Pb-cysteine were found in roots from the 5% biochar treatments. Such organic complexes might impede Pb translocation from root to shoot and subsequently reduce Pb accumulation in rice with biochar amendment.
27544770	Genome-wide association study of eating and cooking qualities in different subpopulations of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Starch and protein are two major components of polished rice, and the amylose and protein contents affect eating and cooking qualities (ECQs). In the present study, genome-wide association study with high-quality re-sequencing data was performed for 10 ECQs in a panel of 227 non-glutinous rice accessions and four derived panels.

RESULTS: Population structure accounted for high phenotypic variation in three routine panels and had minor effects on subspecies-based panels. Using the mixed linear model method based on the P + K model, we detected 29, 24, 16, 17, and 29 loci that were significant for ECQ parameters in each of the five panels. Some of these loci were close to starch synthesis-related genes. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (chr.9: 15417525 ~ 15474876; 17538294 ~ 18443016) for several starch paste viscosity properties detected in four panels were close to the isoamylase 3 gene, one QTL (chr.1: 30627943 ~ 31668474) for consistency detected in three panels was close to the starch synthase IV-1 gene. The QTL (chr.7: 1118122 ~ 1967247) for breakdown (BD), detected in the whole panel and japonica panel, and one QTL (chr.7: 25312126 ~ 26540950) for BD and setback (SB), detected in the whole panel and indica panel, may be specific gene alleles in japonica or indica panels. One previously detected QTL (chr.11: 22240707 ~ 22563596) for protein content and one new QTL (chr.5: 7756614 ~ 8042699) for many ECQ traits detected in more than two panels, may represent valuable targets for future cloning of the underlying genes.

CONCLUSIONS: This study detected minor-effect QTLs affecting ECQs, and may increase our understanding of the genetic differences regulating the formation of ECQ between indica and japonica varieties.
27500558	Molecular cloning of melatonin 3-hydroxylase and its production of cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Pineal Res	Melatonin is metabolized in animals to cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin (3-OHM) not by an enzymatic pathway, but by interaction with hydroxyl radicals. The production of 3-OHM in animals suggests the possible presence of 3-OHM in plants. Prior to the identification of 3-OHM in plants, we directly cloned the corresponding gene(s) responsible for 3-OHM synthesis using Escherichia coli library strains expressing genes belonging to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD) superfamily from rice. Three of 35 E. coli library strains supplemented with 1 mmol/L melatonin were found to produce 3-OHM in their extracellular medium, suggestive of three 2-ODD genes involved in 3-OHM production. The purified recombinant 2-ODD 11, 2-ODD 26, and 2-ODD 33 proteins were shown to catalyze the metabolism of melatonin to 3-OHM, with 2-ODD 11 showing the highest melatonin 3-hydroxylase (M3H) catalytic activity. Consistent with the presence of M3H genes, rice leaves supplemented with 5 mmol/L melatonin produced 3-OHM [233 μg/g fresh weight (FW)], 2-hydroxymelatonin (21 μg/g FW), and N1 -acetyl-N2 -formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (5 μg/g FW). Three M3H transcripts were induced upon the treatment of rice leaves with cadmium followed by an increase in M3H enzyme activity. Cloning of M3H genes in plants has paved the way for the studies of melatonin in plants in terms of its multiple physiological roles.
27498808	A Gene Encoding Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Partially Restores Fertility in RT98-Type Cytoplasmic Male-Sterile Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) lines in rice, which have the cytoplasm of a wild species and the nuclear genome of cultivated rice, are of value for the study of genetic interactions between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. The RT98-type CMS line RT98A and the fertility restorer line RT98C carry the cytoplasm of the wild species Oryza rufipogon and the nuclear genome of the Taichung 65 cultivar (Oryza sativa L.). Based on a classical crossing experiment, fertility is reported to be restored gametophytically by the presence of a tentative single gene, designated Rf98, which is derived from the cytoplasm donor. Fine mapping of Rf98 revealed that at least two genes, which are closely positioned, are required for complete fertility restoration in RT98A. Here, we identified seven pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) genes that are located within a 170 kb region as candidates for Rf98 Complementation tests revealed that the introduction of one of these PPR genes, PPR762, resulted in the partial recovery of fertility with a seed setting rate up to 9.3%. We conclude that PPR762 is an essential fertility restorer gene for RT98-type CMS. The low rate of seed setting suggested that some other genes near the Rf98 locus are also necessary for the full recovery of seed setting.
27463793	Single-wall and multi-wall carbon nanotubes promote rice root growth by eliciting the similar molecular pathways and epigenetic regulation.	2016	IET Nanobiotechnol	Organisms are constantly exposed to environmental stimuli and have evolved mechanisms of protection and adaptation. Various effects of nanoparticles (NPs) on crops have been described and some results confirm that NPs could enhance plant growth at the physiological and genetic levels. This study comparatively analysed the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on rice growth. The results showed that single-wall CNTs were located in the intercellular space while multi-wall CNTs penetrated cell walls in roots. CNTs could promote rice root growth through the regulation of expression of the root growth related genes and elevated global histone acetylation in rice root meristem zones. These responses were returned to normal levels after CNTs were removed from medium. CNTs caused the similar histone acetylation and methylation statuses across the local promoter region of the Cullin-RING ligases 1 (CRL1) gene and increased micrococcal nuclease accessibility of this region, which enhanced this gene expression. The authors results suggested that CNTs could cause plant responses at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and these responses were independent on interaction modes between root cells and CNTs.
27486025	Haplotype distribution and association of candidate genes with salt tolerance in Indian wild rice germplasm.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The association of natural genetic variations of salt-responsive candidate genes belonging to different gene families with salt-tolerance phenotype and their haplotype variation in different geographic regions. Soil salinity covers a large part of the arable land of the world and is a major factor for yield losses in salt-sensitive crops, such as rice. Different gene families that respond to salinity have been identified in rice, but limited success has been achieved in developing salt-tolerant cultivars. Therefore, 21 salt stress-responsive candidate genes belonging to different gene families were re-sequenced to analyse their genetic variation and association with salt tolerance. The average single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density was 16 SNPs per kbp amongst these genes. The identified nucleotide and haplotype diversity showed comparatively higher genetic variation in the transporter family genes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed significant associations of SNPs in BADH2, HsfC1B, MIPS1, MIPS2, MYB2, NHX1, NHX2, NHX3, P5CS1, P5CS2, PIP1, SIK1, SOS1, and SOS2 genes with the salt-tolerant phenotype. A combined analysis of SNPs in the 21 candidate genes and eight other HKT transporter genes produced two separate clusters of tolerant genotypes, carrying unique SNPs in the ion transporter and osmoticum-related genes. Haplotype network analysis showed all the major and few minor alleles distributed over distant geographic regions. Minor haplotypes may be recently evolved alleles which migrated to distant geographic regions and may represent recent expansion of Indian wild rice. The analysis of genetic variation in different gene families identified the relationship between adaptive variations and functional significance of the genes. Introgression of the identified alleles from wild relatives may enhance the salt tolerance and consequently rice production in the salinity-affected areas.
27519315	Starch Content in Leaf Sheath Controlled by CO2-Responsive CCT Protein is a Potential Determinant of Photosynthetic Capacity in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	CO2-responsive CCT protein (CRCT) is the suggested positive regulator of starch synthesis in vegetative organs, particularly the leaf sheath of rice. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in the leaf blade using CRCT overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions. In leaf sheath, the starch content was markedly changed in relation to CRCT expression levels under both CO2 conditions. In contrast, the soluble sugar and starch contents of the leaf blade were markedly increased in the knockdown line grown under elevated CO2 conditions. The overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT did not cause large effects on the photosynthetic rate of the transgenic lines grown under ambient CO2 condition. However, the photosynthetic rate of the overexpression line was enhanced, while that of the knockdown line was substantially decreased under elevated CO2 conditions. These photosynthetic rates were weakly correlated with the nitrogen contents and negatively correlated with the total non-structural carbohydrate contents. Thus, the capacity for starch synthesis in leaf sheath, which is controlled by CRCT, can indirectly affect the carbohydrate content, and then the photosynthetic rate in the leaf blade of rice grown under elevated CO2 conditions.
27479744	An histidine covalent receptor and butenolide complex mediates strigolactone perception.	2016	Nat Chem Biol	Strigolactone plant hormones control plant architecture and are key players in both symbiotic and parasitic interactions. They contain an ABC tricyclic lactone connected to a butenolide group, the D ring. The DWARF14 (D14) strigolactone receptor belongs to the superfamily of α/β-hydrolases, and is known to hydrolyze the bond between the ABC lactone and the D ring. Here we characterized the binding and catalytic functions of RAMOSUS3 (RMS3), the pea (Pisum sativum) ortholog of rice (Oryza sativa) D14 strigolactone receptor. Using new profluorescent probes with strigolactone-like bioactivity, we found that RMS3 acts as a single-turnover enzyme that explains its apparent low enzymatic rate. We demonstrated the formation of a covalent RMS3-D-ring complex, essential for bioactivity, in which the D ring was attached to histidine 247 of the catalytic triad. These results reveal an undescribed mechanism of plant hormone reception in which the receptor performs an irreversible enzymatic reaction to generate its own ligand.
27535768	SNP-based discovery of salinity-tolerant QTLs in a bi-parental population of rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	Mol Genet Genomics	Breeding for salt tolerance is the most promising approach to enhance the productivity of saline prone areas. However, polygenic inheritance of salt tolerance in rice acts as a bottleneck in conventional breeding for salt tolerance. Hence, we set our goals to construct a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based molecular map employing high-throughput SNP marker technology and to investigate salinity tolerant QTLs with closest flanking markers using an elite rice background. Seedling stage salinity responses were assessed in a population of 281 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between At354 (salt tolerant) and Bg352 (salt susceptible), by 11 morpho-physiological indices under a hydroponic system. Selected extreme 94 RILs were genotyped using Illumina Infinium rice 6K SNP array and densely saturated molecular map spanning 1460.81 cM of the rice genome with an average interval of 1.29 cM between marker loci was constructed using 1135 polymorphic SNP markers. The results revealed 83 significant QTLs for 11 salt responsive traits explaining 12.5-46.7 % of phenotypic variation in respective traits. Of them, 72 QTLs responsible for 10 traits were co-localized together forming 14 QTL hotspots at 14 different genomic regions. The all QTL hotspots were flanked less than 1 Mb intervals and therefore the SNP loci associated with these QTL hotspots would be important in candidate gene discovery for salt tolerance.
27494628	Fine Mapping of Two Additive Effect Genes for Awn Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	PLoS One	Awns, important domestication and agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.), are conferred by polygenes and the environment. Near isogenic line (NIL) pairs BM33 and BM38 were constructed from crosses between awnless japonica cv Nipponbare as recurrent parent, and lines SLG or Funingxiaohongmang (awned japonica accessions), respectively, as donors. In order to study the genetic and molecular mechanism of awning, two unknown, independent genes with additive effects were identified in a cross between the NILs. To map and clone the two genes, a BC4F4 population of 8,103 individuals and a BC4F6 population of 11,206 individuals were constructed. Awn3-1 was fine mapped to a 101.13 kb genomic region between Indel marker In316 and SNP marker S9-1 on chromosome 3. Nine predicted genes in the interval were annotated in the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), and Os03g0418600 was identified as the most likely candidate for Awn3-1 through sequence comparisons and RT-PCR assays. Awn4-2 was fine mapped to a 62.4 kb genomic region flanked by simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker M1126 and Indel maker In73 on chromosome 4L. This region contained the previously reported gene An-1 that regulates awn development. Thus, An-1 may be the candidate gene of Awn4-2. These results will facilitate cloning of the awn genes and thereby provide an understanding of the molecular basis of awn development.
27535791	Cooperation between the H3K27me3 Chromatin Mark and Non-CG Methylation in Epigenetic Regulation.	2016	Plant Physiol	H3K27me3 is a repressive chromatin mark of genes and is catalyzed by homologs of Enhancer of zeste [E(z)], a component of Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), while DNA methylation that occurs in CG and non-CG (CHG and CHH, where H is A, C, or T) contexts is a hallmark of transposon silencing in plants. However, the relationship between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in gene repression remains unclear. In addition, the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment to specific genes is not known in plants. Here, we show that SDG711, a rice (Oryza sativa) E(z) homolog, is required to maintain H3K27me3 of many developmental genes after shoot meristem to leaf transition and that many H3K27me3-marked developmental genes are also methylated at non-CG sites in the body regions. SDG711-binding and SDG711-mediated ectopic H3K27me3 also target genes methylated at non-CG sites. Conversely, mutation of OsDRM2, a major rice CHH methyltransferase, resulted in loss of SDG711-binding and H3K27me3 from many genes and their de-repression. Furthermore, we show that SDG711 physically interacts with OsDRM2 and a putative CHG methylation-binding protein. These results together suggest that the repression of many developmental genes may involve both DRM2-mediated non-CG methylation and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 and that the two marks are not generally mutually exclusive but may cooperate in repression of developmentally regulated genes in rice.
27515776	Comparative transcriptome profiling of resistant and susceptible rice genotypes in response to the seedborne pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Fusarium fujikuroi is the causal agent of bakanae, the most significant seed-borne disease of rice. Molecular mechanisms regulating defence responses of rice towards this fungus are not yet fully known. To identify transcriptional mechanisms underpinning rice resistance, a RNA-seq comparative transcriptome profiling was conducted on infected seedlings of selected rice genotypes at one and three weeks post germination (wpg).

RESULTS: Twelve rice genotypes were screened against bakanae disease leading to the identification of Selenio and Dorella as the most resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. Transcriptional changes were more appreciable at 3 wpg, suggesting that this infection stage is essential to study the resistance mechanisms: 3,119 DEGs were found in Selenio and 5,095 in Dorella. PR1, germin-like proteins, glycoside hydrolases, MAP kinases, and WRKY transcriptional factors were up-regulated in the resistant genotype upon infection with F. fujikuroi. Up-regulation of chitinases and down-regulation of MAP kinases and WRKY transcriptional factors were observed in the susceptible genotype. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses detected in Selenio GO terms specific to response to F. fujikuroi: 'response to chitin', 'jasmonic acid biosynthetic process', and 'plant-type hypersensitive response', while Dorella activated different mechanisms, such as 'response to salicylic acid stimulus' and 'gibberellin metabolic process', which was in agreement with the production of gibberellin A3 in Dorella plants.

CONCLUSIONS: RNA-seq profiling was performed for the first time to analyse response of rice to F. fujikuroi infection. Our findings allowed the identification of genes activated in one- and three- week-old rice seedlings of two genotypes infected with F. fujikuroi. Furthermore, we found the pathways involved in bakanae resistance, such as response to chitin, JA-dependent signalling and hypersensitive response. Collectively, this provides important information to elucidate the molecular and cellular processes occurring in rice during F. fujikuroi infection and to develop bakanae resistant rice germplasm.
27558448	Functional characterization of open chromatin in bidirectional promoters of rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Bidirectional gene pairs tend to be highly coregulated and function in similar biological processes in eukaryotic genomes. Structural features and functional consequences of bidirectional promoters (BDPs) have received considerable attention among diverse species. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the bidirectional transcription and coexpression of BDPs remain poorly understood in plants. In this study, we integrated DNase-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and MNase-seq data and investigated the effect of physical DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) positions on the transcription of rice BDPs. We found that the physical position of a DHS relative to the TSS of bidirectional gene pairs can affect the expression of the corresponding genes: the closer a DHS is to the TSS, the higher is the expression level of the genes. Most importantly, we observed that the distribution of DHSs plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription and the coexpression of gene pairs, which are possibly mediated by orchestrating the positioning of histone marks and canonical nucleosomes around BDPs. Our results demonstrate that the combined actions of chromatin structures with DHSs, which contain functional cis-elements for interaction with transcriptional machinery, may play an important role in the regulation of the bidirectional transcription or coexpression in rice BDPs. Our findings may help to enhance the understanding of DHSs in the regulation of bidirectional gene pairs.
27496332	Comparative transcript profiling of alloplasmic male-sterile lines revealed altered gene expression related to pollen development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an ideal model for investigating the mitochondrial-nuclear interaction and down-regulated genes in CMS lines which might be the candidate genes for pollen development in rice. In this study, a set of rice alloplasmic sporophytic CMS lines was obtained by successive backcrossing of Meixiang B, with three different cytoplasmic types: D62A (D type), ZS97A (WA type) and XQZ-A (DA type).

RESULTS: Using microarray, the anther transcript profiles of the three indica rice CMS lines revealed 622 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each of the three CMS lines compared with the maintainer line Meixiang B. GO and MapMan analysis indicated that these DEGs were mainly involved in lipid metabolism and cell wall organization. Compared with the gene expression of sporophytic and gametophytic CMS lines, 303 DEGs were identified and 56 of them were down-regulated in all the CMS lines of rice. These down-regulated DEGs in the CMS lines were found to be involved in tapetum or cell wall formation and their suppressed expression might be related to male sterility. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed that two modules were significantly associated with male sterility and many hub genes that were differentially expressed in the CMS lines.

CONCLUSION: A large set of putative genes involved in anther development was identified in the present study. The results will give some information for the nuclear gene regulation by different cytoplasmic genotypes and provide a rich resource for further functional research on the pollen development in rice.
27481351	Comparative and evolutionary analysis of α-amylase gene across monocots and dicots.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	α-amylase is an important enzyme involved in starch degradation to provide energy to the germinating seedling. The present study was conducted to reveal structural and functional evolution of this gene among higher plants. Discounting polyploidy, most plant species showed only a single copy of the gene making multiple isoforms in different tissues and developmental stages. Genomic length of the gene ranged from 1472 bp in wheat to 2369 bp in soybean, and the size variation was mainly due to differences in the number and size of introns. In spite of this variation, the intron phase distribution and insertion sites were mostly conserved. The predicted protein size ranged from 414 amino acid (aa) in soybean to 449aa in Brachypodium. Overall, the protein sequence similarity among orthologs ranged from 56.4 to 97.4 %. Key motifs and domains along with their relative distances were conserved among plants although several species, genera, and class specific motifs were identified. The glycosyl hydrolase superfamily domain length varied from 342aa in soybean to 384aa in maize and sorghum while length of the C-terminal β-sheet domain was highly conserved with 61aa in all monocots and Arabidopsis but was 59aa in soybean and Medicago. Compared to rice, 3D structure of the proteins showed 89.8 to 91.3 % similarity among the monocots and 72.7 to 75.8 % among the dicots. Sequence and relative location of the five key aa required for the ligand binding were highly conserved in all species except rice.
27560036	The thioredoxin MoTrx2 protein mediates reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and controls pathogenicity as a target of the transcription factor MoAP1 in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Mol Plant Pathol	We have shown previously that the transcription factor MoAP1 governs the oxidative response and is important for pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. To explore the underlying mechanism, we have identified thioredoxin MoTrx2 as a target of MoAP1 in M. oryzae. Thioredoxins are highly conserved 12-kDa oxidoreductase enzymes containing a dithiol-disulfide active site, and function as antioxidants against free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). In yeast and fungi, thioredoxins are important for oxidative stress tolerance and growth. To study the functions of MoTrx2, we generated ΔMotrx2 mutants that exhibit various defects, including sulfite assimilation, asexual and sexual differentiation, infectious hyphal growth and pathogenicity. We found that ΔMotrx2 mutants possess a defect in the scavenging of ROS during host cell invasion and in the active suppression of the rice defence response. We also found that ΔMotrx2 mutants display higher intracellular ROS levels during conidial germination, but lower peroxidase and laccase activities, which contribute to the attenuation in virulence. Given that the function of MoTrx2 overlaps that of MoAP1 in the stress response and pathogenicity, our findings further indicate that MoTrx2 is a key thioredoxin protein whose function is subjected to transcriptional regulation by MoAP1 in M. oryzae.
27555853	Efficient Production of a Bioactive Bevacizumab Monoclonal Antibody Using the 2A Self-cleavage Peptide in Transgenic Rice Callus.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of multiple cancers. Bevacizumab was mostly produced by the mammalian cell expression system. We here reported the first plant-derived Bevacizumab by using transgenic rice callus as an alternative gene expression system. Codon-optimized Bevacizumab light chain (BLC) and Bevacizumab heavy chain (BHC) genes were designed, synthesized as a polyprotein with a 2A self-cleavage linker peptide from the Foot-and-mouth disease virus, cloned into a plant binary vector under a constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter, and transformed into rice nuclear genome through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Southern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the integration and expression of BLC and BHC genes in transgenic rice callus. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis indicated that the rice-derived Bevacizumab mAb was biologically active and the recombinant mAb was expressed at high levels (160.7-242.8 mg/Kg) in transgenic rice callus. The mAb was purified by using protein A affinity chromatography and the purified antibody was tested for its binding affinity with its target human VEGF (hVEGF) antigen by ELISA. Rice callus produced Bevacizumab and a commercial Bevacizumab (Avastin) were shown to have similar binding affinity to hVEGF. These results indicated that rice callus produced Bevacizumab could have similar biological activity and might potentially be used as a cost-effective biosimilar molecule in future cancer treatment.

27508500	QTL Mapping in Three Rice Populations Uncovers Major Genomic Regions Associated with African Rice Gall Midge Resistance.	2016	PLoS One	African rice gall midge (AfRGM) is one of the most destructive pests of irrigated and lowland African ecologies. This study aimed to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with AfRGM pest incidence and resistance in three independent bi-parental rice populations (ITA306xBW348-1, ITA306xTOG7106 and ITA306xTOS14519), and to conduct meta QTL (mQTL) analysis to explore whether any genomic regions are conserved across different genetic backgrounds. Composite interval mapping (CIM) conducted on the three populations independently uncovered a total of 28 QTLs associated with pest incidence (12) and pest severity (16). The number of QTLs per population associated with AfRGM resistance varied from three in the ITA306xBW348-1 population to eight in the ITA306xTOG7106 population. Each QTL individually explained 1.3 to 34.1% of the phenotypic variance. The major genomic region for AfRGM resistance had a LOD score and R2 of 60.0 and 34.1% respectively, and mapped at 111 cM on chromosome 4 (qAfrGM4) in the ITA306xTOS14519 population. The meta-analysis reduced the number of QTLs from 28 to 17 mQTLs, each explaining 1.3 to 24.5% of phenotypic variance, and narrowed the confidence intervals by 2.2 cM. There was only one minor effect mQTL on chromosome 1 that was common in the TOS14519 and TOG7106 genetic backgrounds; all other mQTLs were background specific. We are currently fine-mapping and validating the major effect genomic region on chromosome 4 (qAfRGM4). This is the first report in mapping the genomic regions associated with the AfRGM resistance, and will be highly useful for rice breeders.
27540387	Overexpression of Glycolate Oxidase Confers Improved Photosynthesis under High Light and High Temperature in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	While glycolate oxidase (GLO) is well known as a key enzyme for the photorespiratory metabolism in plants, its physiological function and mechanism remains to be further clarified. Our previous studies have shown that suppression of GLO in rice leads to stunted growth and inhibited photosynthesis (Pn) which is positively and linearly correlated with decreased GLO activities. It is, therefore, of interest to further understand whether Pn can be improved when GLO is up-regulated? In this study, four independent overexpression rice lines, with gradient increases in GLO activity, were generated and functionally analyzed. Phenotypic observations showed that the growth could be improved when GLO activities were increased by 60 or 100%, whereas reduced growth was noticed when the activity was further increased by 150 or 210%. As compared with WT plants, all the overexpression plants exhibited significantly improved Pn under conditions of high light and high temperature, but not under normal conditions. In addition, the overexpression plants were more resistant to the MV-induced photooxidative stress. It was further demonstrated that the antioxidant enzymes, and the antioxidant metabolite glutathione was not significantly altered in the overexpression plants. In contrast, H2O2 and salicylic acid (SA) were correspondingly induced upon the GLO overexpression. Taken together, the results suggest that GLO may play an important role for plants to cope with high light and high temperature, and that H2O2 and SA may serve as signaling molecules to trigger stress defense responses but antioxidant reactions appear not to be involved in the defense.
27554933	Structure and digestion of hybrid Indica rice starch and its biosynthesis.	2016	Int J Biol Macromol	The fine structure (including contents, size and chains length distribution) of amylose and amylopectin of Hybrid Indica Rice starch have an impact on digestion properties of Indica Rice. Indica Rice starches with different amylose contents were chosen as model materials in this study. The amylose and amylopectin size were characterized using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the fine structure of amylopectin were studied by flurophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) and parameterized by amylopectin biosynthesis model to identify associations with starch digestibility. The digestograms of all starches fit first-order kinetics. All results show that the hybrid Indica rice starch with higher amylose content has a slower digestion rate. SEC results show that there is no obviously in chains length distribution (CLD) for amylopectin, but a significantly sharp difference in amylose. No difference in amylopectin was also observed from FACE result. The amylose starch controlled by GBSSI enzyme may be the key parameter to influence starch digestion.
27467463	Vacuolar SPX-MFS transporters are essential for phosphate adaptation in plants.	2016	Plant Signal Behav	To survive in most soils in which inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels are limited and constantly changing, plants universally use the vacuoles as cellular Pi "sink" and "source" to maintain Pi homeostasis. However, the transporters that mediate Pi sequestration into the vacuoles remain unknown. Recently, we and other 2 groups independently identified the members of SPS-MSF family as the candidates for tonoplast Pi transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We and Liu et al. demonstrated that one of SPS-MSF member, VPT1 (Vacuolar Phosphate Transporter 1), also named as PHT5;1 (Phosphate Transporter 5;1), plays a predominant role in Pi sequestration of vacuoles in Arabidopsis. Here we show that vpt1 mutants and VPT1-GFP overexpressing lines displayed sensitive to Pi stress under the hydroponic system containing the medium with low iron, supporting that VPT1 is essential for Arabidopsis to adapt phosphate stress.
27559341	Root ABA Accumulation Enhances Rice Seedling Drought Tolerance under Ammonium Supply: Interaction with Aquaporins.	2016	Front Plant Sci	In previous studies, we demonstrated that ammonium nutrition enhances the drought tolerance of rice seedlings compared to nitrate nutrition and contributes to a higher root water uptake ability. It remains unclear why rice seedlings maintain a higher water uptake ability when supplied with ammonium under drought stress. Here, we focused on the effects of nitrogen form and drought stress on root abscisic acid (ABA) concentration and aquaporin expression using hydroponics experiments and stimulating drought stress with 10% PEG6000. Drought stress decreased the leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductivity and increased the leaf temperature of plants supplied with either ammonium or nitrate, but especially under nitrate supply. After 4 h of PEG treatment, the root protoplast water permeability and the expression of root PIP and TIP genes decreased in plants supplied with ammonium or nitrate. After 24 h of PEG treatment, the root hydraulic conductivity, the protoplast water permeability, and the expression of some aquaporin genes increased in plants supplied with ammonium compared to those under non-PEG treatment. Root ABA accumulation was induced by 24 h of PEG treatment, especially in plants supplied with ammonium. The addition of exogenous ABA decreased the expression of PIP and TIP genes under non-PEG treatment but increased the expression of some of them under PEG treatment. We concluded that drought stress induced a down-regulation of aquaporin expression, which appeared earlier than did root ABA accumulation. With continued drought stress, aquaporin expression and activity increased due to root ABA accumulation in plants supplied with ammonium.
27521428	A wide reprogramming of histone H3 modifications during male meiosis I in rice is dependent on the Argonaute protein MEL1.	2016	J Cell Sci	The roles of epigenetic mechanisms, including small-RNA-mediated silencing, in plant meiosis largely remain unclear, despite their importance in plant reproduction. This study unveiled that rice chromosomes are reprogrammed during the premeiosis-to-meiosis transition in pollen mother cells (PMCs). This large-scale meiotic chromosome reprogramming (LMR) continued throughout meiosis I, during which time H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) was increased, and H3K9 acetylation and H3S10 phosphorylation were broadly decreased, with an accompanying immunostaining pattern shift of RNA polymerase II. LMR was dependent on the rice Argonaute protein, MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1), which is specifically expressed in germ cells prior to meiosis, because LMR was severely diminished in mel1 mutant anthers. Pivotal meiotic events, such as pre-synaptic centromere association, DNA double-strand break initiation and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, were also disrupted in this mutant. Interestingly, and as opposed to the LMR loss in most chromosomal regions, aberrant meiotic protein loading and hypermethylation of H3K9 emerged on the nucleolar organizing region in the mel1 PMCs. These results suggest that MEL1 plays important roles in epigenetic LMR to promote faithful homologous recombination and synapsis during rice meiosis.
27555860	Two Novel AP2/EREBP Transcription Factor Genes TaPARG Have Pleiotropic Functions on Plant Architecture and Yield-Related Traits in Common Wheat.	2016	Front Plant Sci	AP2/EREBPs play significant roles in plant growth and development. A novel, pleiotropic TaPARG (PLANT ARCHITECTURE-RELATED GENE), a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor gene family, and its flanking sequences were isolated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two TaPARG genes were identified and named as TaPARG-2A and TaPARG-2D. Their amino acid sequences were highly similar especially in the functional domains. TaPARG-2A on chromosome 2A was flanked by markers Xwmc63 and Xgwm372. TaPARG-2D was mapped to chromosome 2D. Subcellular localization revealed that TaPARG-2D was localized in the nucleus. The results of tissue expression pattern, overexpression in rice, association analysis and distinct population verification jointly revealed that TaPARG functions during the entire growth cycle of wheat. Its functions include regulation of plant architecture-related and yield-related traits. Association analysis, geographic distribution and allelic frequencies suggested that favored haplotypes Hap-2A-2 and Hap-2A-3 were selected in Chinese wheat breeding programs. Both favored haplotypes might be caused by a single amino acid substitution (His/Tyr). These results suggest that TaPARG is a regulatory factor in plant growth and development, and that the favored alleles might be useful for improving plant architecture and grain yield of wheat.
27565968	A novel application of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and fluorescence imaging for analysing tapetum and microspore development.	2017	Histochem Cell Biol	The precisely timed process of tapetum development and its degradation involving programmed cell death is an important molecular event during anther development. Through its degeneration, the tapetum not only provides nutritive substances to the developing microspores but also contributes to the pollen wall by way of sporopollenin, which is a complex mixture of biopolymers, containing long-chain fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics and traces of carotenoids. A number of dyes and staining methods have been used to visualize tapetal structure and its components by using light microscopy techniques, but none of these methods could differentially stain and thus distinguish tapetal cells from other cell types of anther wall. While analysing progression of tapetum development in different cell types in rice anthers, we discovered a unique property of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which upon interaction with some specific component(s) in tapetal cells and developing microspores emits fluorescence at ~620 nm. In rice anthers, the PAS-associated fluorescence could be observed initially in tapetum and developing microspores, and subsequent to degeneration of tapetum, the fluorescence was found to emanate mainly from the pollen wall. We also show that PAS-dependent fluorescence in tapetal cells is distinct from the autofluorescence resulting from pollen wall components and is also not caused by interaction of PAS with pollen starch. Henceforth, this novel fluorescence property of PAS stain could prove to be a new tool in the toolkit of developmental biologists to analyse different aspects of tapetum development and its degeneration with little more ease and specificity.
27531613	Characteristic and inheritance analysis of targeted mutagenesis mediated by genome editing in rice.	2016	Yi Chuan	The transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) systems are two current genome editing technologies. Here, we compare and analyze the characteristics of the targeted mutations mediated by these two systems, such as efficiency, type, position, time, and genetic patterns. Both the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems can induce site-specific mutations in T0 rice plants effectively, but CRISPR/Cas9 is more effective. The major mutation type in both systems is the short insertion/deletion(InDel) mutation within 10 base pairs: deletions ranging from 1 to 10 bps are more often in TALEN, and 1bp insertions are more often in CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by CRISPR/Cas9 are more precise than TALEN. In addition, DSBs could be repaired by the homologous recombination at a low frequency, causing DNA fragment duplication mutations. In some cases, the DNA fragments between the two close targets are deleted or inverted, and the mutation efficiency does not positively correlatewith the mutation efficiency of each target. Mutagenesis mediated by the TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 system can occur as early as in transformed callus cells, and less frequently in somatic cells. Consequently, four different mutation types are formed, including homozygous, heterozygous, bi-allelic and chimeric mutations, with bi-allelic mutations having the highest rate and chimeric mutations having the lowest rate. All, except chimeric mutations, can descend stably into the next generation.
27574525	Phosphate Uptake and Allocation - A Closer Look at Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Oryza sativa L.	2016	Front Plant Sci	This year marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery and characterization of the two Arabidopsis PHT1 genes encoding the phosphate transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana. So far, multiple inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters have been described, and the molecular basis of Pi acquisition by plants has been well-characterized. These genes are involved in Pi acquisition, allocation, and/or signal transduction. This review summarizes how Pi is taken up by the roots and further distributed within two plants: A. thaliana and Oryza sativa L. by plasma membrane phosphate transporters PHT1 and PHO1 as well as by intracellular transporters: PHO1, PHT2, PHT3, PHT4, PHT5 (VPT1), SPX-MFS and phosphate translocators family. We also describe the role of the PHT1 transporters in mycorrhizal roots of rice as an adaptive strategy to cope with limited phosphate availability in soil.
27532545	Plant Growth Promotion and Suppression of Bacterial Leaf Blight in Rice by Inoculated Bacteria.	2016	PLoS One	The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of rice rhizosphere associated antagonistic bacteria for growth promotion and disease suppression of bacterial leaf blight (BLB). A total of 811 rhizospheric bacteria were isolated and screened against 3 prevalent strains of BLB pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) of which five antagonistic bacteria, i.e., Pseudomonas spp. E227, E233, Rh323, Serratia sp. Rh269 and Bacillus sp. Rh219 showed antagonistic potential (zone of inhibition 1-19 mm). Production of siderophores was found to be the common biocontrol determinant and all the strains solubilized inorganic phosphate (82-116 μg mL-1) and produced indole acetic acid (0.48-1.85 mg L-1) in vitro. All antagonistic bacteria were non-pathogenic to rice, and their co-inoculation significantly improved plant health in terms of reduced diseased leaf area (80%), improved shoot length (31%), root length (41%) and plant dry weight (60%) as compared to infected control plants. Furthermore, under pathogen pressure, bacterial inoculation resulted in increased activity of defense related enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase, along with 86% increase in peroxidase and 53% increase in catalase enzyme activities in plants inoculated with Pseudomonas sp. Rh323 as well as co-inoculated plants. Bacterial strains showed good colonization potential in the rice rhizosphere up to 21 days after seed inoculation. Application of bacterial consortia in the field resulted in an increase of 31% in grain yield and 10% in straw yield over non-inoculated plots. Although, yield increase was statistically non-significant but was accomplished with overall saving of 20% chemical fertilizers. The study showed that Pseudomonas sp. Rh323 can be used to develop dual-purpose inoculum which can serve not only to suppress BLB but also to promote plant growth in rice.
27536521	Suppression of Magnaporthe oryzae and interaction between Bacillus subtilis and rice plants in the control of rice blast.	2016	Springerplus	Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative pathogen of rice blast, has caused extensive losses to rice cultivation worldwide. Strains of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis have been used as biocontrol agents against rice blast. However, little has been reported about the interaction between B. subtilis and the rice plant and its mechanism of action. Here, the colonization process and induced disease resistance by B. subtilis SYX04 and SYX20 in rice plants was examined. Strains of B. subtilis labeled with green fluorescent protein reached population of more than 5 × 10(6) CFU/g after 20 days on mature rice leaves and were detected after 3 days on newly grown leaves. Results showed that SYX04 and SYX20 not only inhibited spore germination, germ tube length, and appressorial formation but also caused a series of alterations in the structures of hyphae and conidia. The cell walls and membrane structures of the fungus showed ultrastructural abnormalities, which became severely degraded as observed through scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The mixture of both B. subtilis and M. oryzae resulted in enhanced activity of peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase while there was significantly more superoxide dismutase activity in plants that had been sprayed with B. subtilis alone. The present study suggests that colonized SYX04 and SYX20 strains protected rice plants and exhibited antifungal activity and induced systemic resistance, thus indicating their potential biological control agents.
27498027	Isolation, structural analysis, and expression characteristics of the maize nuclear factor Y gene families.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) has been shown to play an important role in growth, development, and response to environmental stress. A NF-Y complex, which consists of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and, NF-YC, binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. Although NF-Y proteins have been reported in Arabidopsis and rice, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of ZmNF-Y genes has not yet been performed. To examine the functions of ZmNF-Y genes in this family, we isolated and characterized 50 ZmNF-Y (14 ZmNF-YA, 18 ZmNF-YB, and 18 ZmNF-YC) genes in an analysis of the maize genome. The 50 ZmNF-Y genes were distributed on all 10 maize chromosomes, and 12 paralogs were identified. Multiple alignments showed that maize ZmNF-Y family proteins had conserved regions and relatively variable N-terminal or C-terminal domains. The comparative syntenic map illustrated 40 paralogous NF-Y gene pairs among the 10 maize chromosomes. Microarray data showed that the ZmNF-Y genes had tissue-specific expression patterns in various maize developmental stages and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The results suggested that ZmNF-YB2, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 16 and ZmNF-YC6, 8, and 15 were induced, while ZmNF-YA1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, ZmNF-YB15, and ZmNF-YC3 and 9 were suppressed by drought stress. ZmNF-YA3, ZmNF-YA8 and ZmNF-YA12 were upregulated after infection by the three pathogens, while ZmNF-YA1 and ZmNF-YB2 were suppressed. These results indicate that the ZmNF-Ys may have significant roles in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses.
27493192	PcircRNA_finder: a software for circRNA prediction in plants.	2016	Bioinformatics	MOTIVATION: Recent studies reveal an important role of non-coding circular RNA (circRNA) in the control of cellular processes. Because of differences in the organization of plant and mammal genomes, the sensitivity and accuracy of circRNA prediction programs using algorithms developed for animals and humans perform poorly for plants.

RESULTS: A circRNA prediction software for plants (termed PcircRNA_finder) was developed that is more sensitive in detecting circRNAs than other frequently used programs (such as find_circ and CIRCexplorer), Based on analysis of simulated and real rRNA-/RNAase R RNA-Seq data from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice PcircRNA_finder provides a more comprehensive sensitive, precise prediction method for plants circRNAs.

27495313	Aroma volatile analyses and 2AP characterization at various developmental stages in Basmati and Non-Basmati scented rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice plant growth is comprised of distinct phases, such as vegetative, reproductive, grain filling and maturity phases. In these phases synthesis and availability of primary and secondary metabolites including volatile organic compounds (VOC's) is highly variable. In scented rice, aroma volatiles are synthesized in aerial plant parts and deposited in mature grains. There are more than 100 VOCs reported to be responsible for flavor in basmati rice. It will be interesting to keep track of aroma volatiles across the developmental stages in scented rice. Therefore, the aroma volatiles contributing in aroma with special reference to the major compound 2 acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) were screened at seven developmental stages in scented rice cultivars Basmati-370 and Ambemohar-157 along with non-scented rice cultivar IR-64 as a control following HS-SPME-GC-MS method. In addition, the expression levels of key genes and precursor levels involved in 2AP biosynthesis were studied.

RESULTS: The study indicated that volatilome of scented rice cultivars is more complex than non-scented rice cultivar. N-heterocyclic class was the major distinguishing class between scented from non-scented rice. A total of 14 compounds including, 2AP were detected specifically in scented rice cultivars. Maximum number of compounds were synthesized at seedling stage and decreased gradually at reproductive and maturity. The seedling stage is an active phase of development where maximum number green leaf volatiles were synthesized which are known to act as defense molecules for protection of young plant parts. Among the 14 odor active compounds (OACs), 10 OACs were accumulated at higher concentrations significantly in scented rice cultivars and contribute in the aroma. 2AP content was highest in mature grains followed by at booting stage. Gene expression analysis revealed that reduced expression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (badh2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and elevated level of triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and Δ1-Pyrolline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS) transcript enhances 2AP accumulation.

CONCLUSIONS: Most diverse compounds were synthesized at seedling stage and OACs were accumulated more at flowering followed by seedling stage. Distinct accumulation pattern exists for 2AP and other aroma volatiles at various developmental stages. The study revealed the mechanism of 2AP accumulation such that 2AP in mature grains might be transported from leaves and stem sheath and accumulation takes place in grains.
27551285	Analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae Genome Reveals a Fungal Effector, Which Is Able to Induce Resistance Response in Transgenic Rice Line Containing Resistance Gene, Pi54.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most important diseases of rice. Pi54, a rice gene that imparts resistance to M. oryzae isolates prevalent in India, was already cloned but its avirulent counterpart in the pathogen was not known. After decoding the whole genome of an avirulent isolate of M. oryzae, we predicted 11440 protein coding genes and then identified four candidate effector proteins which are exclusively expressed in the infectious structure, appresoria. In silico protein modeling followed by interaction analysis between Pi54 protein model and selected four candidate effector proteins models revealed that Mo-01947_9 protein model encoded by a gene located at chromosome 4 of M. oryzae, interacted best at the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of Pi54 protein model. Yeast-two-hybrid analysis showed that Mo-01947_9 protein physically interacts with Pi54 protein. Nicotiana benthamiana leaf infiltration assay confirmed induction of hypersensitive response in the presence of Pi54 gene in a heterologous system. Genetic complementation test also proved that Mo-01947_9 protein induces avirulence response in the pathogen in presence of Pi54 gene. Here, we report identification and cloning of a new fungal effector gene which interacts with blast resistance gene Pi54 in rice.
27559339	Carotenoids in Staple Cereals: Metabolism, Regulation, and Genetic Manipulation.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Carotenoids play a critical role in animal and human health. Animals and humans are unable to synthesize carotenoids de novo, and therefore rely upon diet as sources of these compounds. However, major staple cereals often contain only small amounts of carotenoids in their grains. Consequently, there is considerable interest in genetic manipulation of carotenoid content in cereal grain. In this review, we focus on carotenoid metabolism and regulation in non-green plant tissues, as well as genetic manipulation in staple cereals such as rice, maize, and wheat. Significant progress has been made in three aspects: (1) seven carotenogenes play vital roles in carotenoid regulation in non-green plant tissues, including 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase influencing isoprenoid precursor supply, phytoene synthase, β-cyclase, and ε-cyclase controlling biosynthesis, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases responsible for degradation, and orange gene conditioning sequestration sink; (2) provitamin A-biofortified crops, such as rice and maize, were developed by either metabolic engineering or marker-assisted breeding; (3) quantitative trait loci for carotenoid content on chromosomes 3B, 7A, and 7B were consistently identified, eight carotenogenes including 23 loci were detected, and 10 gene-specific markers for carotenoid accumulation were developed and applied in wheat improvement. A comprehensive and deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism in crops will be beneficial in improving our precision in improving carotenoid contents. Genomic selection and gene editing are emerging as transformative technologies for provitamin A biofortification.
27497661	Development and application of a general plasmid reference material for GMO screening.	None	Plasmid	The use of analytical controls is essential when performing GMO detection through screening tests. Additionally, the presence of taxon-specific sequences is analyzed mostly for quality control during GMO detection. In this study, 11 commonly used genetic elements involving three promoters (P-35S, P-FMV35S and P-NOS), four marker genes (Bar, NPTII, HPT and Pmi), and four terminators (T-NOS, T-35S, T-g7 and T-e9), together with the reference gene fragments from six major crops of maize, soybean, rapeseed, rice, cotton and wheat, were co-integrated into the same single plasmid to construct a general reference plasmid pBI121-Screening. The suitability test of pBI121-Screening plasmid as reference material indicated that the non-target sequence on the pBI121-Screening plasmid did not affect the PCR amplification efficiencies of screening methods and taxon-specific methods. The sensitivity of screening and taxon-specific assays ranged from 5 to 10 copies of pBI121-Screening plasmid, meeting the sensitivity requirement of GMO detection. The construction of pBI121-Screening solves the lack of a general positive control for screening tests, thereby reducing the workload and cost of preparing a plurality of the positive control.
27539013	The use of SNP hybridisation arrays and cytogenetics to characterise deletions of chromosome 4B in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Many deletions of the wheat Della ( Rht - B1 ) gene and its flanking regions were isolated in a simple phenotypic screen, and characterised by modified analysis of SNP hybridisation data and cytogenetics. In a dwarf wheat suppressor screen, many tall 'revertants' were isolated following mutagenesis of a severely dwarfed (Rht-B1c) hexaploid wheat. About 150 lines were identified as putative deletions of Rht-B1c, based on the PCR analysis. Southern blot hybridisation established that most of them lacked the Rht-B1 gene, but retained the homoeologues Rht-A1 and Rht-D1. PCR assays were developed for orthologues of two genes that flank Rht-1/Della in the genomes of the model species Brachypodium and rice. Deletion of the B-genome-specific homoeologues of these two genes was confirmed in the Rht-B1 deletion lines, indicating loss of more than a single gene. SNP chip hybridisation analysis established the extents of deletion in these lines. Based on the synteny with Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 4 g, and rice chromosomes 3g and 11g, notional deletion maps were established. The deletions ranged from interstitial deletions of 4BS through to loss of all 4BS markers. There were also instances, where all 4BS and 4BL markers were lost, and these lines had poor fertility and narrow stems and leaves. Cytogenetic studies on selected lines confirmed the loss of portions of 4BS in lines that lacked most or all 4BS markers. They also confirmed that lines lacking both 4BS and 4BL markers were nullisomics for 4B. These nested deletion lines share a common genetic background and will have applications in assigning markers to regions of 4BS as well as to 4BL. The potential for this type of analysis in other regions of the wheat genome is discussed.
27546334	Lanthanum regulates the reactive oxygen species in the roots of rice seedlings.	2016	Sci Rep	In this study, the effects of La(3+) on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant metabolism were studied in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Shengdao 16) exposed to increasing concentrations of La(3+) (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM). The level of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde was increased by 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mM La(3+), and the activity of catalase and peroxidase was increased by 0.05 and 0.1 mM La(3+). However, La(3+) treatments stimulated superoxide dismutase activity in the roots of rice seedlings at all tested concentrations. In addition, the probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) was used to investigate the instantaneous change of ROS in the root cells with the laser-scanning confocal microscopy. The result indicated that ROS level was declined after treated with 0.05 mM La(3+). The results showed that the appropriate concentration of La(3+) decreased the level of ROS, and hormetic effects on the antioxidant metabolism were found in the roots of rice exposed to 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM La(3+).
27528428	Three zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins in cabbage (Brassica rapa) play diverse roles in seed germination and plant growth under normal and abiotic stress conditions.	2017	Physiol Plant	Despite the increasing understanding of the stress-responsive roles of zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins (RZs) in several plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), the functions of RZs in cabbage (Brassica rapa) have not yet been elucidated. In this study, the functional roles of the three RZ family members present in the cabbage genome, designated as BrRZ1, BrRZ2 and BrRZ3, were investigated in transgenic Arabidopsis under normal and environmental stress conditions. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that all BrRZ proteins were exclusively localized in the nucleus. The expression levels of each BrRZ were markedly increased by cold, drought or salt stress and by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Expression of BrRZ3 in Arabidopsis retarded seed germination and stem growth and reduced seed yield of Arabidopsis plants under normal growth conditions. Germination of BrRZ2- or BrRZ3-expressing Arabidopsis seeds was delayed compared with that of wild-type seeds under dehydration or salt stress conditions and cold stress conditions, respectively. Seedling growth of BrRZ3-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants was significantly inhibited under salt, dehydration or cold stress conditions. Notably, seedling growth of all three BrRZ-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants was inhibited upon ABA treatment. Importantly, all BrRZs possessed RNA chaperone activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the three cabbage BrRZs harboring RNA chaperone activity play diverse roles in seed germination and seedling growth of plants under abiotic stress conditions as well as in the presence of ABA.
27426698	Characterization of the phytochelatins and their derivatives in rice exposed to cadmium based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with data-dependent hybrid linear ion trap orbitrap mass spectrometry.	2016	Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom	RATIONALE: The identification and quantification of phytochelatins (PCs) and their derivatives are important to understand their roles in plant growth and development. A method couplling high-performance liquid chromatography with hybrid linear ion trap Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap) was developed to screen PCs that have the same characteristic product ions. This approach was used for the fragmentation pattern analysis of glutathione (GSH) and PC standards, which allowed identification of the fragmentation pathways of their derivatives isolated from rice roots, stems and leaves.

METHODS: In this study, we developed a method to detect and identify PCs and their derivatives in rice based on HPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap. Spectrum interpretation and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of PCs provide sufficient information to discover the novel PC derivatives. This approach includes precursor ion scan and product ion scan to detect and character the novel PC derivatives.

RESULTS: Based on HCD-MS/MS fragmentation patterns, four PCs and 18 PC derivatives were identified. Among them, seven PC derivatives, i.e., iso-PC2 (Asn), iso-PC3 (Asn), iso-PC2 (Cys), des-γGlu-iso-PC3 (Ser), des-Cys-iso-PC2 (Glu), des-Cys-iso-PC3 (Glu) and des-Cys-iso-PC4 (Glu), have not been previously reported. This method was validated by profiling GSH, PCs and PC derivatives in rice. Preliminary results revealed that PCs and their derivatives, except GSH, are markedly induced by Cd treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap method was successfully developed for the identification of PCs and their derivatives. The C-terminal linked to Gly is replaced with Glu, Ser, Asn, Gln or Cys, thereby creating a family of chemicals that share several structural properties. This technique could be particularly useful for investigators studying plant metabolomics. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
27555544	OsFRDL1 expressed in nodes is required for distribution of iron to grains in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Iron (Fe) is essential for plant growth and development, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its distribution to different organs are poorly understood. We found that OsFRDL1 (FERRIC REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE LIKE 1), a plasma membrane-localized transporter for citrate, was highly expressed in the upper nodes of rice at the reproductive growth stage. OsFRDL1 was expressed in most cells of enlarged vascular bundles, diffuse vascular bundles, and the interjacent parenchyma cell bridges of uppermost node I, as well as vascular tissues of the leaf blade, leaf sheath, peduncle, rachis, husk, and stamen. Knockout of OsFRDL1 decreased pollen viability and grain fertility when grown in a paddy field. Iron was deposited in the parenchyma cell bridges, a few of the cell layers of the parenchyma tissues outside of the bundle sheath of enlarged vascular bundles in node I in both the wild-type rice and osfrdl1 mutant, but the mutant accumulated more Fe than the wild-type rice in this area. A stem-fed experiment with stable isotope 57Fe showed that the distribution of Fe in the anther and panicle decreased in the knockout line, but that in the flag leaf it increased compared with the wild-type rice. Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL1 expressed in the upper nodes is required for the distribution of Fe in the panicles through solubilizing Fe deposited in the apoplastic part of nodes in rice.
27567632	Reconstruction of the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway in rice endosperm reveals a metabolic bottleneck at the level of endogenous β-carotene hydroxylase activity.	2017	Transgenic Res	Astaxanthin is a high-value ketocarotenoid rarely found in plants. It is derived from β-carotene by the 3-hydroxylation and 4-ketolation of both ionone end groups, in reactions catalyzed by β-carotene hydroxylase and β-carotene ketolase, respectively. We investigated the feasibility of introducing an extended carotenoid biosynthesis pathway into rice endosperm to achieve the production of astaxanthin. This allowed us to identify potential metabolic bottlenecks that have thus far prevented the accumulation of this valuable compound in storage tissues such as cereal grains. Rice endosperm does not usually accumulate carotenoids because phytoene synthase, the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in the pathway, is not present in this tissue. We therefore expressed maize phytoene synthase 1 (ZmPSY1), Pantoea ananatis phytoene desaturase (PaCRTI) and a synthetic Chlamydomonas reinhardtii β-carotene ketolase (sCrBKT) in transgenic rice plants under the control of endosperm-specific promoters. The resulting grains predominantly accumulated the diketocarotenoids canthaxanthin, adonirubin and astaxanthin as well as low levels of monoketocarotenoids. The predominance of canthaxanthin and adonirubin indicated the presence of a hydroxylation bottleneck in the ketocarotenoid pathway. This final rate-limiting step must therefore be overcome to maximize the accumulation of astaxanthin, the end product of the pathway.
27513992	Post-flowering night respiration and altered sink activity account for high night temperature-induced grain yield and quality loss in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Physiol Plant	High night temperature (HNT) is a major constraint to sustaining global rice production under future climate. Physiological and biochemical mechanisms were elucidated for HNT-induced grain yield and quality loss in rice. Contrasting rice cultivars (N22, tolerant; Gharib, susceptible; IR64, high yielding with superior grain quality) were tested under control (23°C) and HNT (29°C) using unique field-based tents from panicle initiation till physiological maturity. HNT affected 1000 grain weight, grain yield, grain chalk and amylose content in Gharib and IR64. HNT increased night respiration (Rn) accounted for higher carbon losses during post-flowering phase. Gharib and IR64 recorded 16 and 9% yield reduction with a 63 and 35% increase in average post-flowering Rn under HNT, respectively. HNT altered sugar accumulation in the rachis and spikelets across the cultivars with Gharib and IR64 recording higher sugar accumulation in the rachis. HNT reduced panicle starch content in Gharib (22%) and IR64 (11%) at physiological maturity, but not in the tolerant N22. At the enzymatic level, HNT reduced sink strength with lower cell wall invertase and sucrose synthase activity in Gharib and IR64, which affected starch accumulation in the developing grain, thereby reducing grain weight and quality. Interestingly, N22 recorded lower Rn-mediated carbon losses and minimum impact on sink strength under HNT. Mechanistic responses identified will facilitate crop models to precisely estimate HNT-induced damage under future warming scenarios.
27566485	Oral immunisation of mice with transgenic rice calli expressing cholera toxin B subunit fused to consensus dengue cEDIII antigen induces antibodies to all four dengue serotypes.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Dengue virus (DENV) infection is an emerging global health threat. DENV consists of four distinct serotypes, necessitating a tetravalent vaccine. In this study, expression of consensus envelope protein domain III (cEDIII) fused to cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) in transgenic rice calli was improved using the luminal binding protein BiP at the N-terminus and the SEKDEL signal sequences at the C-terminus, targeting the recombinant protein to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that the fusion protein showed higher levels of expression when compared to the fusion proteins using rice amylase 3D (RAmy3D) or CTB native signal sequence only. The CTB-cEDIII fusion protein was evaluated as an oral dengue vaccine candidate in mice. Serotype specific systemic IgG antibodies and specific IgA response in feces were detected and furthermore, T cell proliferation and high frequency antibody-secreting B cells were detected in the spleen. These results suggest the possible use of plant-based dengue tetravalent vaccine targeted to the mucosal immune system for induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses to DENV infection.
27507407	Development and characterization of chromosome segment substitution lines derived from Oryza rufipogon in the genetic background of O. sativa spp. indica cultivar 9311.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) constitutes a primary gene source for rice breed improvement. Chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) for O. rufipogon is a powerful tool for fine mapping of quantitative traits, new gene discovery, and marker-assisted breeding. Thus, they provide a basis for a wide range of genomic and genetic studies.

RESULTS: In this study, a set of 198 CSSLs were developed from a cross between recurrent parent indica var. 9311 and an O. rufipogon donor parent; these were then genotyped using 313 polymorphic SSR markers evenly distributed across the 12 rice chromosomes. On average, each CSSL carried 2.16 introgressed segments, and the genetic distance of each segment was about 6 cM. The segments collectively covered 84.9 % of the wild rice genome. Based on these CSSLs, 25 QTLs involved in 10 agronomic traits were identified. Seven CSSLs were subjected to a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism chip assay and two QTLs, qSH4-1 and qDTH10-1, detected. In addition, a new QTL associated with the heading date was detected in a 78-Kb region on chromosome 10, thus proving the ability of these CSSLs to identify new QTLs and genes.

CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed CSSL population proved a useful tool for both gene identification and whole-genome research of wild rice. These CSSL materials will provide a foundation for rice variety improvement.
27543605	Albino Leaf 2 is involved in the splicing of chloroplast group I and II introns in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Chloroplasts play an essential role in plant growth and development through manipulating photosynthesis and the production of hormones and metabolites. Although many genes or regulators involved in chloroplast biogenesis and development have been isolated and characterized, identification of novel components is still lacking. We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, termed albino leaf 2 (al2), using genetic screening. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the al2 mutation caused obvious albino leaves at the early developmental stage, eventually leading to al2 seedling death. Electron microscopy investigations indicated that the chloroplast structure was disrupted in the al2 mutants at an early developmental stage and subsequently resulted in the breakdown of the entire chloroplast. Molecular cloning illustrated that AL2 encodes a chloroplast group IIA intron splicing facilitator (CRS1) in rice, which was confirmed by a genetic complementation experiment. Moreover, our results demonstrated that AL2 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, including green and non-green tissues. Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of a subset of chloroplast genes that contain group IIA and IIB introns were significantly reduced in the al2 mutant compared to that in the wild type, suggesting that AL2 is a functional CRS1 in rice. Differing from the orthologous CRS1 in maize and Arabidopsis that only regulates splicing of the chloroplast group II intron, our results demonstrated that the AL2 gene is also likely to be involved in the splicing of the chloroplast group I intron. They also showed that disruption of AL2 results in the altered expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, plastid-encoded polymerases and nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes. Taken together, these findings shed new light on the function of nuclear-encoded chloroplast group I and II intron splicing factors in rice.
27545518	ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES regulates cell proliferation and procambium cell establishment during aerial organ development in rice.	2017	New Phytol	To understand the molecular mechanisms of rice aerial organ development, we identified a mutant gene that caused a significant decrease in the width of aerial organs, termed ABNORMAL VASCULAR BUNDLES (AVB). Histological analysis showed that the slender aerial organs were caused by cell number reduction. In avb, the number of vascular bundles in aerial organs was reduced, whereas the area of the vascular bundles was increased. Ploidy analysis and the in situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in avb. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in avb. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that AVB encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions. Our research shows that AVB is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the AVB gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling.
27501838	Transcriptome profiling of drought responsive noncoding RNAs and their target genes in rice.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Plant transcriptome profiling has provided a tool for understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to stress conditions. Analysis of genome-wide transcriptome will provides a useful dataset of drought responsive noncoding RNAs and their candidate target genes that may be involved in drought stress responses.

RESULTS: Here RNA-seq analyses of leaves from drought stressed rice plants was performed, producing differential expression profiles of noncoding RNAs. We found that the transcript levels of 66 miRNAs changed significantly in response to drought conditions and that they were negatively correlated with putative target genes during the treatments. The negative correlations were further validated by qRT-PCR using total RNAs from both drought-treated leaves and various tissues at different developmental stages. The drought responsive miRNA/target pairs were confirmed by the presence of decay intermediates generated by miRNA-guided cleavages in Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE) libraries. We observed that the precursor miR171f produced two different mature miRNAs, miR171f-5p and miR171f-3p with 4 candidate target genes, the former of which was responsive to drought conditions. We found that the expression levels of the miR171f precursor negatively correlated with those of one candidate target gene, but not with the others, suggesting that miR171f-5p was drought-responsive, with Os03g0828701-00 being a likely target. Pre-miRNA expression profiling indicated that miR171f is involved in the progression of rice root development and growth, as well as the response to drought stress. Ninety-eight lncRNAs were also identified, together with their corresponding antisense transcripts, some of which were responsive to drought conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: We identified rice noncoding RNAs (66 miRNAs and 98 lncRNAs), whose expression was highly regulated by drought stress conditions, and whose transcript levels negatively correlated with putative target genes.
27555861	Development of Gene-Pyramid Lines of the Elite Restorer Line, RPHR-1005 Possessing Durable Bacterial Blight and Blast Resistance.	2016	Front Plant Sci	RPHR-1005, the stable restorer line of the popular medium slender (MS) grain type rice hybrid, DRRH-3 was improved in this study for resistance against bacterial blight (BB) and blast diseases through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). In this study, four major resistance genes (i.e., Xa21 and Xa33 for BB resistance and Pi2 and Pi54 for blast resistance) have been transferred to RPHR-1005 using RPBio Patho-1 (possessing Xa21 + Pi2), RPBio Patho-2 (possessing Xa21 + Pi54) and FBR1-15EM (possessing Xa33) as the donors. Foreground selection was carried out using PCR-based molecular markers specific for the target resistance genes and the major fertility restorer genes, Rf3 and Rf4, while background selection was carried out using a set of parental polymorphic rice SSR markers and backcrossing was continued uptoBC2 generation. At BC2F2, plants possessing the gene combination- Xa21 + Pi2, Xa21 + Pi54 and Xa33 in homozygous condition and with >92% recovery of the recurrent parent genome (RPG) were identified and intercrossed to combine all the four resistance genes. Twenty-two homozygous, pyramid lines of RPHR-1005 comprising of three single-gene containing lines, six 2-gene containing lines, eight 3-gene containing lines, and five 4-gene containing lines were identified among the double intercross lines at F3 generation (DICF3). They were then evaluated for their resistance against BB and blast, fertility restoration ability and for key agro-morphological traits. While single gene containing lines were resistant to either BB or blast, the 2-gene, 3-gene, and 4-gene pyramid lines showed good level of resistance against both and/or either of the two diseases. Most of the 2-gene, 3-gene, and 4-gene containing pyramid lines showed yield levels and other key agro-morphological and grain quality traits comparable to the original recurrent parent and showed complete fertility restoration ability, with a few showing higher yield as compared to RPHR-1005. Further, the experimental hybrids derived by crossing the gene-pyramid lines of RPHR-1005 with APMS6A (the female parent of DRRH-3), showed heterosis levels equivalent to or higher than DRRH-3. The results of present study exemplify the utility of MABB for targeted improvement of multiple traits in hybrid rice.
27544640	A proteomic analysis of salt stress response in seedlings of two African rice cultivars.	2016	Biochim Biophys Acta	Salt stress is one of the key abiotic stresses threatening future agricultural production and natural ecosystems. This study investigates the salt stress response of two rice seedlings, which were screened from 28 Kenya rice cultivars. A proteomic analysis was carried out and Mapman bin codes employed in protein function categorization. Proteins in the redox, stress, and signaling categories were identified, and whose expression differed between the salt tolerant and the salt sensitive samples employed in the present study. 104 and 102 root proteins were observed as significantly altered during salt stress in the tolerant and sensitive samples, respectively and 13 proteins were commonly expressed. Among the 13 proteins, ketol-acid reductoisomerase protein was upregulated in both 1 and 3days of salt treatment in the tolerant sample, while it was down-regulated in both 1 and 3days of salt treatment in the sensitive sample. Actin-7, tubulin alpha, V-type proton ATPase, SOD (Cu-Zn), SOD (Mn), and pyruvate decarboxylase were among the observed salt-induced proteins. In general, this study improves our understanding about salt stress response mechanisms in rice.
27228993	Root transcriptomes of two acidic soil adapted Indica rice genotypes suggest diverse and complex mechanism of low phosphorus tolerance.	2017	Protoplasma	Low phosphorus (P) tolerance in rice is a biologically and agronomically important character. Low P tolerant Indica-type rice genotypes, Sahbhagi Dhan (SD) and Chakhao Poreiton (CP), are adapted to acidic soils and show variable response to low P levels. Using RNAseq approach, transcriptome data was generated from roots of SD and CP after 15 days of low P treatment to understand differences and similarities at molecular level. In response to low P, number of genes up-regulated (1318) was more when compared with down-regulated genes (761). Eight hundred twenty-one genes found to be significantly regulated between SD and CP in response to low P. De novo assembly using plant database led to further identification of 1535 novel transcripts. Functional annotation of significantly expressed genes suggests two distinct methods of low P tolerance. While root system architecture in SD works through serine-threonine kinase PSTOL1, suberin-mediated cell wall modification seems to be key in CP. The transcription data indicated that CP relies more on releasing its internally bound Pi and coping with low P levels by transcriptional and translational modifications and using dehydration response-based signals. Role of P transporters seems to be vital in response to low P in CP while sugar- and auxin-mediated pathway seems to be preferred in SD. At least six small RNA clusters overlap with transcripts highly expressed under low P, suggesting role of RNA super clusters in nutrient response in plants. These results help us to understand and thereby devise better strategy to enhance low P tolerance in Indica-type rice.
27194164	Effect of enhanced UV-B radiation on methane emission in a paddy field and rice root exudation of low-molecular-weight organic acids.	2016	Photochem Photobiol Sci	A local rice variety, "Baijiaolaojing", was grown in a paddy field in the Yuanyang rice terraces under ambient and supplemental levels of ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation. The effects of enhanced UV-B radiation (5 and 10 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) on methane emissions in the paddy field were evaluated using a closed-chamber gas chromatography-based system, and the contents of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in root exudates were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Peaks in methane emissions in the paddy field were detected at 60, 80 and 100 days after rice transplantation. The highest level of cumulative methane emissions occurred at the tillering stage, followed by the jointing-booting and maturity stages. The lowest level was found at the flowering stage. The enhanced UV-B radiation did not change the seasonal variation in methane emissions in the paddy field; however, it induced a significant increase in the flux of methane emissions at the jointing-booting and maturity stages, as well as a significant increase in the cumulative flux of methane emissions throughout the growth period. In addition, the enhanced UV-B radiation caused an increase in the contents of oxalic acid and succinic acid and a decrease in the contents of tartaric acid and malic acid in rice root exudates. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (r = 0.725, p < 0.01) was found between the content of oxalic acid and the methane emissions in the paddy field. The results indicated that enhanced UV-B radiation promoted methane emissions in the paddy field, which was closely associated with its impact on the exudation of LMWOAs by rice roots.
27193349	Jointed toxicity of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and Cd to rice seedlings: NPs alleviated Cd toxicity and Cd promoted NPs uptake.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Previous studies have reported that nanoparticles (NPs) and heavy metals are toxic to the environment. However, the jointed toxicity is not yet well understood. This study was aimed to investigate the combined toxicity of TiO2 NPs and the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) to plants. Rice (Oryzasativa L.) was selected as the target plant. The rice seedlings were randomly separated into 12 groups and treated with CdCl2 (0, 10 and 20 mg/L) and TiO2 NPs (0, 10, 100 and 1000 mg/L). The plant height, biomass and root length indicated significant toxicity of Cd to the growth, but TiO2 NPs exhibited the potential ability to alleviate the Cd toxicity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) confirmed the existence of TiO2 NPs in plants. Elemental analysis of Ti and Cd suggested that the presences of Cd significantly decreased the Ti accumulation in the rice roots in the co-exposure treatments. Interestingly, TiO2 NPs could lower the Cd uptake and distribution in rice roots and leaves. The results of antioxidant enzyme activity, lipid peroxide as well as phytohormones varied in the different treatments. Comparing with the Cd alone treatment, the net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were significantly increased in the co-exposure treatments, suggesting that TiO2 NPs could tremendously reduce the Cd toxicity.
27192712	Environmental and physiological effects on grouping of drought-tolerant and susceptible rice varieties related to rice (Oryza sativa) root hydraulics under drought.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Root hydraulic limitations (i.e. intra-plant restrictions to water movement) may be related to crop performance under drought, and groupings in the hydraulic function of drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible rice (Oryza sativa) varieties have been previously reported. This study aimed to better understand the environmental and physiological relationships with rice root hydraulics under drought.

METHODS: Xylem sap bleeding rates in the field (gsap g-1shoot) were measured on seasonal and diurnal time frames, during which time environmental conditions were monitored and physiological measurements were conducted. Complementary experiments on the effects of vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on root hydraulic conductivity and on transpiration rates of de-rooted tillers were conducted in growth chambers.

KEY RESULTS: The diurnal effects on bleeding rate were more closely related to irradiance than VPD, and VPD effects on root hydraulic conductivity measured on 21-day-old plants were due to effects on plant growth including root surface area, maximum root depth and root:shoot ratio. Leaf osmotic potential was related to the grouping of drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible varieties in rice root hydraulics, and these groupings were independent of differences in phenology. Low single-tiller bleeding rates were observed under high evapo-transpirational demand, higher bleeding rates were observed at more negative leaf osmotic potentials in drought-susceptible varieties, and drought-tolerant and susceptible varieties differed in the VPD-induced increase in transpiration rates of de-rooted tillers. Low root suberin amounts in some of the drought-susceptible varieties may have resulted in higher ion transport, as evidenced by higher sap K+ concentration and higher bleeding rates in those varieties.

CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of the environmental effects on shoots that can influence root hydraulics. The consistent groupings of drought-tolerant and susceptible varieties suggest that traits affecting plant osmotic status may regulate root hydraulic response to drought in rice.
27174682	Finlay-Wilkinson's regression coefficient as a pre-screening criterion for yield responsiveness to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in crops.	2016	Physiol Plant	The rising atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2 ]) can increase crop productivity, but there are likely to be intraspecific variations in the response. To meet future world food demand, screening for genotypes with high [CO2 ] responsiveness will be a useful option, but there is no criterion for high [CO2 ] responsiveness. We hypothesized that the Finlay-Wilkinson regression coefficient (RC) (for the relationship between a genotype's yield versus the mean yield of all genotypes in a specific environment) could serve as a pre-screening criterion for identifying genotypes that respond strongly to elevated [CO2 ]. We collected datasets on the yield of 6 rice and 10 soybean genotypes along environmental gradients and compared their responsiveness to elevated [CO2 ] based on the regression coefficients (i.e. the increases of yield per 100 µmol mol-1 [CO2 ]) identified in previous reports. We found significant positive correlations between the RCs and the responsiveness of yield to elevated [CO2 ] in both rice and soybean. This result raises the possibility that the coefficient of the Finlay-Wilkinson relationship could be used as a pre-screening criterion for [CO2 ] responsiveness.
27185548	Temporal interactions of plant - insect - predator after infection of bacterial pathogen on rice plants.	2016	Sci Rep	Pathogenic infection on plants may affect interactions of host-plants with their herbivores, as well as the herbivores with their predators. In this study, the effects of infection by pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes a vascular disease in rice, on rice plants and consequent interactions with a rice herbivore, brown rice planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and its major predator, Cyrtorhinus lividipennis, were investigated. The results showed that the rice plants exhibited increased resistance to BPH only at 3 d post-inoculation of Xoo, while the Xoo infection did not affect the development and fecundity of BPH. BPH exhibited a higher preference to Xoo infected rice plants, whereas C. lividipennis preferred the Xoo infected rice plants after BPH fed, but preferred healthy rice plants without BPH fed. Volatile organic compounds emitted from Xoo rice were significantly higher than those from healthy rice plants, Xoo infection on BPH fed plants caused rice plants to emit more the herbivore-induced plant volatiles, while all of these changes correlated to the temporal dimension. These results demonstrated that Xoo infection significantly influenced the interactions of rice plants with two non-vectors, BPH and its predator, although these effects exhibited in a temporal pattern after infection.
27288224	The Metabolite Pathway between Bundle Sheath and Mesophyll: Quantification of Plasmodesmata in Leaves of C3 and C4 Monocots.	2016	Plant Cell	C4 photosynthesis is characterized by a CO2-concentrating mechanism between mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells of leaves. This generates high metabolic fluxes between these cells, through interconnecting plasmodesmata (PD). Quantification of these symplastic fluxes for modeling studies requires accurate quantification of PD, which has proven difficult using transmission electron microscopy. Our new quantitative technique combines scanning electron microscopy and 3D immunolocalization in intact leaf tissues to compare PD density on cell interfaces in leaves of C3 (rice [Oryza sativa] and wheat [Triticum aestivum]) and C4 (maize [Zea mays] and Setaria viridis) monocot species. Scanning electron microscopy quantification of PD density revealed that C4 species had approximately twice the number of PD per pitfield area compared with their C3 counterparts. 3D immunolocalization of callose at pitfields using confocal microscopy showed that pitfield area per M-BS interface area was 5 times greater in C4 species. Thus, the two C4 species had up to nine times more PD per M-BS interface area (S. viridis, 9.3 PD µm(-2); maize, 7.5 PD µm(-2); rice 1.0 PD µm(-2); wheat, 2.6 PD µm(-2)). Using these anatomical data and measured photosynthetic rates in these C4 species, we have now calculated symplastic C4 acid flux per PD across the M-BS interface. These quantitative data are essential for modeling studies and gene discovery strategies needed to introduce aspects of C4 photosynthesis to C3 crops.
27375646	Genetic Diversity and Elite Allele Mining for Grain Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Association Mapping.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Mining elite alleles for grain size and weight is of importance for the improvement of cultivated rice and selection for market demand. In this study, association mapping for grain traits was performed on a selected sample of 628 rice cultivars using 262 SSRs. Grain traits were evaluated by grain length (GL), grain width (GW), grain thickness (GT), grain length to width ratio (GL/GW), and 1000-grain weight (TGW) in 2013 and 2014. Our result showed abundant phenotypic and genetic diversities found in the studied population. In total, 2953 alleles were detected with an average of 11.3 alleles per locus. The population was divided into seven subpopulations and the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) ranged from 34 to 84 cM. Genome-wide association mapping detected 10 marker trait association (MTAs) loci for GL, 1MTAs locus for GW, 7 MTAs loci for GT, 3 MTAs loci for GL/GW, and 1 MTAs locus for TGW. Twenty-nine, 2, 10, 5, and 3 elite alleles were found for the GL, GW, GT, GL/GW, and TGW, respectively. Optimal cross designs were predicted for improving the target traits. The accessions containing elite alleles for grain traits mined in this study could be used for breeding rice cultivars and cloning the candidate genes.
27350029	Analyzing the performance of fluorescence parameters in the monitoring of leaf nitrogen content of paddy rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Leaf nitrogen content (LNC) is a significant factor which can be utilized to monitor the status of paddy rice and it requires a reliable approach for fast and precise quantification. This investigation aims to quantitatively analyze the correlation between fluorescence parameters and LNC based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technology. The fluorescence parameters exhibited a consistent positive linear correlation with LNC in different growing years (2014 and 2015) and different rice cultivars. The R(2) of the models varied from 0.6978 to 0.9045. Support vector machine (SVM) was then utilized to verify the feasibility of the fluorescence parameters for monitoring LNC. Comparison of the fluorescence parameters indicated that F740 is the most sensitive (the R(2) of linear regression analysis of the between predicted and measured values changed from 0.8475 to 0.9226, and REs ranged from 3.52% to 4.83%) to the changes in LNC among all fluorescence parameters. Experimental results demonstrated that fluorescence parameters based on LIF technology combined with SVM is a potential method for realizing real-time, non-destructive monitoring of paddy rice LNC, which can provide guidance for the decision-making of farmers in their N fertilization strategies.
27311455	Exploring the genetic characteristics of 93-11 and Nipponbare recombination inbred lines based on the GoldenGate SNP assay.	2016	Sci China Life Sci	Understanding genetic characteristics in rice populations will facilitate exploring evolutionary mechanisms and gene cloning. Numerous molecular markers have been utilized in linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mappings. However, segregation-distorted markers were rarely considered, which prevented understanding genetic characteristics in many populations. In this study, we designed a 384-marker GoldenGate SNP array to genotype 283 recombination inbred lines (RILs) derived from 93-11 and Nipponbare Oryza sativa crosses. Using 294 markers that were highly polymorphic between parents, a linkage map with a total genetic distance of 1,583.2 cM was constructed, including 231 segregation-distorted markers. This linkage map was consistent with maps generated by other methods in previous studies. In total, 85 significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) values≥5% were identified. Among them, 34 QTLs were overlapped with reported genes/QTLs relevant to corresponding traits, and 17 QTLs were overlapped with reported sterility-related genes/QTLs. Our study provides evidence that segregation-distorted markers can be used in linkage map construction and QTL mapping. Moreover, genetic information resulting from this study will help us to understand recombination events and segregation distortion. Furthermore, this study will facilitate gene cloning and understanding mechanism of inter-subspecies hybrid sterility and correlations with important agronomic traits in rice.
27468828	Comparative transcriptomics of rice plants under cold, iron, and salt stresses.	2016	Funct Integr Genomics	Abiotic stresses such as salinity, iron toxicity, and low temperatures are the main limiting factors of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield. The elucidation of the genes involved in responses to these stresses is extremely important to understand the mechanisms that confer tolerance, as well as for the development of cultivars adapted to these conditions. In this study, the RNA-seq technique was used to compare the transcriptional profile of rice leaves (cv. BRS Querência) in stage V3, exposed to cold, iron, and salt stresses for 24 h. A range of 41 to 51 million reads was aligned, in which a total range of 88.47 to 89.21 % was mapped in the reference genome. For cold stress, 7905 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed, 2092 for salt and 681 for iron stress; 370 of these were common to the three DEG stresses. Functional annotation by software MapMan demonstrated that cold stress usually promoted the greatest changes in the overall metabolism, and an enrichment analysis of overrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms showed that most of them are contained in plastids, ribosome, and chloroplasts. Saline stress induced a more complex interaction network of upregulated overrepresented GO terms with a relatively low number of genes compared with cold stress. Our study demonstrated a high number of differentially expressed genes under cold stress and a greater relationship between salt and iron stress levels. The physiological process most affected at the molecular level by the three stresses seems to be photosynthesis.
27406081	Dissection of genetic architecture of rice plant height and heading date by multiple-strategy-based association studies.	2016	Sci Rep	Xieyou9308 is a certified super hybrid rice cultivar with a high grain yield. To investigate its underlying genetic basis of high yield potential, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between the maintainer line XieqingzaoB (XQZB) and the restorer line Zhonghui9308 (ZH9308) was constructed for identification of quantitative trait SNPs (QTSs) associated with two important agronomic traits, plant height (PH) and heading date (HD). By re-sequencing of 138 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), a total of ~0.7 million SNPs were identified for the association studies on the PH and HD. Three association mapping strategies (including hypothesis-free genome-wide association and its two complementary hypothesis-engaged ones, QTL-based association and gene-based association) were adopted for data analysis. Using a saturated mixed linear model including epistasis and environmental interaction, we identified a total of 31 QTSs associated with either the PH or the HD. The total estimated heritability across three analyses ranged from 37.22% to 45.63% and from 37.53% to 55.96% for the PH and HD, respectively. In this study we examined the feasibility of association studies in an experimental population (RIL) and identified several common loci through multiple strategies which could be preferred candidates for further research.

27448955	Salicylic acid mediates antioxidant defense system and ABA pathway related gene expression in Oryza sativa against quinclorac toxicity.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	The auxin herbicide quinclorac is widely used for controlling weeds in transplanted and direct-seeded rice fields. However, its phytotoxic responses on rice are still unknown. Therefore, in the present investigation we studied the effects of different concentrations (0, 0.1 and 0.5g/L) of quinclorac herbicide on the physiological and biochemical changes of two rice cultivars (XS 134 and ZJ 88) and further analyzed the ameliorating role of salicylic acid (SA) on quinclorac toxicity in rice plants. The results revealed that exogenous application of SA significantly increased plant biomass and total chlorophyll contents in herbicide stressed plants. The lipid peroxidation and ROS (H2O2, O2(-.), (-)OH) production were significantly increased in roots and leaves of both rice cultivars under quinclorac stress, demonstrating an oxidative burst in rice plants. Whereas, application of SA significantly lowered ROS contents under quinclorac stress. Further, exogenous SA treatment significantly modulated antioxidant enzymes and enhanced GSH concentration in stress plants. Anatomical observations of leaf and root revealed that herbicide affected internal structures, while SA played a vital role in protection from toxic effects. Expression analysis of stress hormone ABA genes (OsABA8oxs, OsNCEDs) revealed that quinclorac application enhanced stress condition in cultivar ZJ 88, while SA treatment downregulated ABA genes more in cultivar XS 134, which correlated with the enhanced tolerance to quinclorac induced oxidative stress in this cultivar. The present study delineated that SA played a critical role under quinclorac stress in both rice cultivars by regulating antioxidant defense system, reducing ROS formation and preventing the degradation of internal cell organelles.
27516766	Comparative Transcriptional Profiling of Primed and Non-primed Rice Seedlings under Submergence Stress.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Submergence stress is a limiting factor for direct-seeded rice systems in rainfed lowlands and flood-prone areas of South and Southeast Asia. The present study demonstrated that submergence stress severely hampered the germination and seedling growth of rice, however, seed priming alleviated the detrimental effects of submergence stress. To elucidate the molecular basis of seed priming-induced submergence tolerance, transcriptome analyses were performed using 4-day-old primed (selenium-Se and salicylic acid-SA priming) and non-primed rice seedlings under submergence stress. Genomewide transcriptomic profiling identified 2371 and 2405 transcripts with Se- and SA-priming, respectively, that were differentially expressed in rice compared with non-priming treatment under submergence. Pathway and gene ontology term enrichment analyses revealed that genes involved in regulation of secondary metabolism, development, cell, transport, protein, and metal handling were over-represented after Se- or SA-priming. These coordinated factors might have enhanced the submergence tolerance and maintained the better germination and vigorous seedling growth of primed rice seedlings. It was also found that many genes involved in cellular and metabolic processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, cellular, and metabolic biosynthesis, nitrogen compound metabolic process, transcription, and response to oxidative stress were induced and overlapped in seed priming treatments, a finding which reveals the common mechanism of seed priming-induced submergence tolerance. Taken together, these results may provide new avenues for understanding and advancing priming-induced responses to submergence tolerance in crop plants.
27453463	A novel gene OsAHL1 improves both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	A novel gene, OsAHL1, containing an AT-hook motif and a PPC domain was identified through genome-wide profiling and analysis of mRNAs by comparing the microarray of drought-challenged versus normally watered rice. The results indicated OsAHL1 has both drought avoidance and drought tolerance that could greatly improve drought resistance of the rice plant. Overexpression of OsAHL1 enhanced multiple stress tolerances in rice plants during both seedling and panicle development stages. Functional studies revealed that OsAHL1 regulates root development under drought condition to enhance drought avoidance, participates in oxidative stress response and also regulates the content of chlorophyll in rice leaves. OsAHL1 specifically binds to the A/T rich sequence region of promoters or introns, and hence directly regulates the expression of many stress related downstream genes.
27388982	Heavy metals and essential elements in Italian cereals.	2016	Food Addit Contam Part B Surveill	Crops intended for human nutrition and food production containing different essential trace elements, such as copper and zinc, could be contaminated by toxic metals like cadmium and lead. The interrelationship between micronutrients and contaminant trace elements in different cereals was investigated in North-western Italy, where both agricultural and industrial activities are present. Elemental concentrations in sampled cereals were assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Rice, oats and barley reached the highest median levels for Al, Cd and Pb content, while corn samples were less contaminated by toxic metals. Regarding essential elements highest median values of Cu and Zn were both found in barley, while Ni median content was higher in oats. Rice had the lowest median levels of essential elements. The correlation study between toxic and essential elements seemed to demonstrate fixed trends in analysed samples, corroborating the importance of a different diet to limit potential adverse effects caused by toxic elements.
27381441	A Layered Defense Strategy Mediated by Rice E3 Ubiquitin Ligases against Diverse Pathogens.	2016	Mol Plant	
27296957	Endophytic bacterial and fungal microbiota in sprouts, roots and stems of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	None	Microbiol Res	The objective of this study was to elucidate the endophytic microbiota in rice sprouts, roots, and stems, and their transmission in the plant development. Prior to DNA extraction, roots and stems were treated with 36% formaldehyde and 0.1M NaOH solutions to remove epiphytic bacterial whole 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial and fungal taxa in the sprout, root, and stem samples were analyzed using Illumina-based sequencing of the V3-V4 hyper variable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and the ITS2 regions of fungal rRNA genes, respectively. Results showed that more diverse bacterial OTUs were detected in roots than in stems, while more diverse fungal OTUs were detected in stems than in roots. Compared with the endophytic microbiota in sprouts, the bacterial OTUs increased in roots but decreased in stems, whereas the fungal OTUs in both stems and roots decreased. Sprout-borne bacterial genera Sphingomonas and Pseudomonus, and fungal genera Fusarium, Pestalotiopsis, and Penicillium were detected in stems and roots. The coexistence of these indigenous bacterial and fungal taxa in sprouts, roots, and stems indicated their transmission during the development from sprouts to mature plants. The results from this study should be useful to better understand the plant-microbe interactions and to select suitable microbial taxa for rice production.
27498978	Multi Stakeholders' Attitudes toward Bt rice in Southwest, Iran: Application of TPB and Multi Attribute Models.	2017	Integr Psychol Behav Sci	Organisms that have been genetically engineered and modified (GM) are referred to as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Bt crops are plants that have been genetically modified to produce certain proteins from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which makes these plants resistant to certain lepidopteran and coleopteran species. Genetically Modified (GM) rice was produced in 2006 by Iranian researchers from Tarom Mowla'ii and has since been called 'Bt rice'. As rice is an important source of food for over 3 billion inhabitants on Earth, this study aims to use a correlational survey in order to shed light on the predicting factors relating to the extent of stakeholders' behavioral intentions towards Bt rice. It is assumed and the results confirm that "attitudes toward GM crops" can be used as a bridge in the Attitude Model and the Behavioral Intention Model in order to establish an integrated model. To this end, a case study was made of the Southwest part of Iran in order to verify this research model. This study also revealed that as a part of the integrated research framework in the Behavior Intention Model both constructs of attitude and the subjective norm of the respondents serve as the predicting factors of stakeholders' intentions of working with Bt rice. In addition, the Attitude Model, as the other part of the integrated research framework, showed that the stakeholders' attitudes toward Bt rice can only be determined by the perceived benefits (e.g. positive outcomes) of Bt rice.
27319052	Expression analysis of bZIP transcription factor encoding genes in response to water deficit stress in rice.	2016	Indian J Exp Biol	In plants, basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factors regulate several developmental processes and activate genes in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Role of stress responsive bZIP transcription factors was studied in paddy in relation to different stages of development and water deficit stress (WDS) in a drought tolerant cultivar N22 and susceptible IR 64. Further, relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI) and abscisic acid (ABA) content were measured as indices of WDS at different stages of development and levels of stress. Expression of stress responsive bZIP transcription factors was directly correlated to developmental stage and WDS and indirectly to RWC, MSI and ABA content.
27228161	Genome-Wide Association Study for Traits Related to Plant and Grain Morphology, and Root Architecture in Temperate Rice Accessions.	2016	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: In this study we carried out a genome-wide association analysis for plant and grain morphology and root architecture in a unique panel of temperate rice accessions adapted to European pedo-climatic conditions. This is the first study to assess the association of selected phenotypic traits to specific genomic regions in the narrow genetic pool of temperate japonica. A set of 391 rice accessions were GBS-genotyped yielding-after data editing-57000 polymorphic and informative SNPS, among which 54% were in genic regions.

RESULTS: In total, 42 significant genotype-phenotype associations were detected: 21 for plant morphology traits, 11 for grain quality traits, 10 for root architecture traits. The FDR of detected associations ranged from 3 · 10-7 to 0.92 (median: 0.25). In most cases, the significant detected associations co-localised with QTLs and candidate genes controlling the phenotypic variation of single or multiple traits. The most significant associations were those for flag leaf width on chromosome 4 (FDR = 3 · 10-7) and for plant height on chromosome 6 (FDR = 0.011).

CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the effectiveness and resolution of the developed platform for high-throughput phenotyping, genotyping and GWAS in detecting major QTLs for relevant traits in rice. We identified strong associations that may be used for selection in temperate irrigated rice breeding: e.g. associations for flag leaf width, plant height, root volume and length, grain length, grain width and their ratio. Our findings pave the way to successfully exploit the narrow genetic pool of European temperate rice and to pinpoint the most relevant genetic components contributing to the adaptability and high yield of this germplasm. The generated data could be of direct use in genomic-assisted breeding strategies.
27193099	Prediction and validation of cis-regulatory elements in 5' upstream regulatory regions of lectin receptor-like kinase gene family in rice.	2017	Protoplasma	Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) play crucial roles in regulating plant growth and developmental processes in response to stress. In transcriptional gene regulation for normal cellular functions, cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) direct the temporal and spatial gene expression with respect to environmental stimuli. A complete insightful of the transcriptional gene regulation system relies on effective functional analysis of CREs. Here, we analyzed the potential putative CREs present in the promoters of rice LecRLKs genes by using PlantCARE database. The CREs in LecRLKs promoters are associated with plant growth/development, light response, plant hormonal regulation processes, various stress responses, hormonal response like ABA, root-specific expression responsive, drought responsive, and cell and organ specific regulatory elements. The effect of methylation on these cis-regulatory elements was also analyzed. Real-time analysis of rice seedling under various stress conditions showed the expression levels of selected LecRLK genes superimposing the number of different CREs present in 5' upstream region. The overall results showed that the possible CREs function in the selective expression/regulation of LecRLKs gene family and during rice plant development under stress.
27192711	Ethylene is involved in root phosphorus remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) by regulating cell-wall pectin and enhancing phosphate translocation to shoots.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants are able to grow under phosphorus (P)-deficient conditions by coordinating Pi acquisition, translocation from roots to shoots and remobilization within the plant. Previous reports have demonstrated that cell-wall pectin contributes greatly to rice cell-wall Pi re-utilization under P-deficient conditions, but whether other factors such as ethylene also affect the pectin-remobilizing capacity remains unclear.

METHODS: Two rice cultivars, 'Nipponbare' (Nip) and 'Kasalath' (Kas) were cultured in the +P (complete nutrient solution), -P (withdrawing P from the complete nutrient solution), +P+ACC (1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, an ethylene precursor, adding 1 μm ACC to the complete nutrient solution) and -P+ACC (adding 1 μm ACC to -P nutrient solution) nutrient solutions for 7 d.

KEY RESULTS: After 7 d -P treatment, there was clearly more soluble P in Nip root and shoot, accompanied by additional production of ethylene in Nip root compared with Kas. Under P-deficient conditions, addition of ACC significantly increased the cell-wall pectin content and decreased cell-wall retained P, and thus more soluble P was released to the root and translocated to the shoot, which was mediated by the expression of the P deficiency- responsive gene OsPT2, which also strongly induced by ACC treatment under both P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: Ethylene positively regulates pectin content and expression of OsPT2, which ultimately makes more P available by facilitating the solubilization of P fixed in the cell wall and its translocation to the shoot.
27198135	Genome wide association mapping for grain shape traits in indica rice.	2016	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Using genome-wide association mapping, 47 SNPs within 27 significant loci were identified for four grain shape traits, and 424 candidate genes were predicted from public database. Grain shape is a key determinant of grain yield and quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, our knowledge of genes controlling rice grain shape remains limited. Genome-wide association mapping based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) has recently emerged as an effective approach for identifying genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying complex traits in plants. In this study, association mapping based on 5291 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted to identify significant loci associated with grain shape traits in a global collection of 469 diverse rice accessions. A total of 47 SNPs were located in 27 significant loci for four grain traits, and explained ~44.93-65.90 % of the phenotypic variation for each trait. In total, 424 candidate genes within a 200 kb extension region (±100 kb of each locus) of these loci were predicted. Of them, the cloned genes GS3 and qSW5 showed very strong effects on grain length and grain width in our study. Comparing with previously reported QTLs for grain shape traits, we found 11 novel loci, including 3, 3, 2 and 3 loci for grain length, grain width, grain length-width ratio and thousand grain weight, respectively. Validation of these new loci would be performed in the future studies. These results revealed that besides GS3 and qSW5, multiple novel loci and mechanisms were involved in determining rice grain shape. These findings provided valuable information for understanding of the genetic control of grain shape and molecular marker assistant selection (MAS) breeding in rice.
27294384	Genetic Variability in Phosphorus Responses of Rice Root Phenotypes.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Low phosphorus availability is a major factor limiting rice productivity. Since root traits determine phosphorus acquisition efficiency, they are logical selection targets for breeding rice with higher productivity in low phosphorus soils. Before using these traits for breeding, it is necessary to identify genetic variation and to assess the plasticity of each trait in response to the environment. In this study, we measured phenotypic variation and effect of phosphorus deficiency on root architectural, morphological and anatomical traits in 15 rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes. Rice plants were grown with diffusion-limited phosphorus using solid-phase buffered phosphorus to mimic realistic phosphorus availability conditions.

RESULTS: Shoot dry weight, tiller number, plant height, number of nodal roots and shoot phosphorus content were reduced under low phosphorus availability. Phosphorus deficiency significantly reduced large lateral root density and small and large lateral root length in all genotypes, though the degree of plasticity and relative allocation of root length between the two root classes varied among genotypes. Root hair length and density increased in all genotypes in response to low phosphorus. Nodal root cross-sectional area was significantly less under low phosphorus availability, and reduced cortical area was disproportionately responsible for this decline. Phosphorus deficiency caused a 20 % increase in the percent cortical area converted to aerenchyma. Total stele area and meta-xylem vessel area responses to low phosphorus differed significantly among genotypes. Phosphorus treatment did not significantly affect theoretical water conductance overall, but increased or reduced it in a few genotypes. All genotypes had restricted water conductance at the base of the nodal root compared to other positions along the root axis.

CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial genetic variation for all root traits investigated. Low phosphorus availability significantly affected most traits, often to an extent that varied with the genotype. With the exception of stele and meta-xylem vessel area, root responses to low phosphorus were in the same direction for all genotypes tested. Therefore, phenotypic evaluations conducted with adequate fertility should be useful for genetic mapping studies and identifying potential sources of trait variation, but these should be confirmed in low-phosphorus environments.
27324699	Rice Domestication Revealed by Reduced Shattering of Archaeological rice from the Lower Yangtze valley.	2016	Sci Rep	Plant remains dating to between 9000 and 8400 BP from a probable ditch structure at the Huxi site include the oldest rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet bases and associated plant remains recovered in China. The remains document an early stage of rice domestication and the ecological setting in which early cultivation was taking place. The rice spikelet bases from Huxi include wild (shattering), intermediate, and domesticated (non-shattering) forms. The relative frequency of intermediate and non-shattering spikelet bases indicates that selection for, at the very least, non-shattering rice was underway at Huxi. The rice also has characteristics of japonica rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica), helping to clarify the emergence of a significant lineage of the crop. Seeds, phytoliths and their context provide evidence of increasing anthropogenesis and cultivation during the occupation. Rice spikelet bases from Kuahuqiao (8000-7700 BP), Tianluoshan (7000-6500 BP), Majiabang (6300-6000 BP), and Liangzhu (5300-4300 BP) sites indicate that rice underwent continuing selection for reduced shattering and japonica rice characteristics, confirming a prolonged domestication process for rice.
27300326	Recent progress on the genetics and molecular breeding of brown planthopper resistance in rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating pest of rice. Host-plant resistance is the most desirable and economic strategy in the management of BPH. To date, 29 major BPH resistance genes have been identified from indica cultivars and wild rice species, and more than ten genes have been fine mapped to chromosome regions of less than 200 kb. Four genes (Bph14, Bph26, Bph17 and bph29) have been cloned. The increasing number of fine-mapped and cloned genes provide a solid foundation for development of functional markers for use in breeding. Several BPH resistant introgression lines (ILs), near-isogenic lines (NILs) and pyramided lines (PLs) carrying single or multiple resistance genes were developed by marker assisted backcross breeding (MABC). Here we review recent progress on the genetics and molecular breeding of BPH resistance in rice. Prospect for developing cultivars with durable, broad-spectrum BPH resistance are discussed.
27246799	Overcoming inter-subspecific hybrid sterility in rice by developing indica-compatible japonica lines.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple crop. The exploitation of the great heterosis that exists in the inter-subspecific crosses between the indica and japonica rice has long been considered as a promising way to increase the yield potential. However, the male and female sterility frequently occurred in the inter-subspecific hybrids hampered the utilization of the heterosis. Here we report that the inter-subspecific hybrid sterility in rice is mainly affected by the genes at Sb, Sc, Sd and Se loci for F1 male sterility and the gene at S5 locus for F1 female sterility. The indica-compatible japonica lines (ICJLs) developed by pyramiding the indica allele (S-i) at Sb, Sc, Sd and Se loci and the neutral allele (S-n) at S5 locus in japonica genetic background through marker-assisted selection are compatible with indica rice in pollen fertility and in spikelet fertility. These results showed a great promise of overcoming the inter-subspecific hybrid sterility and exploiting the heterosis by developing ICJLs.
27389871	Optimum breeding strategies using genomic selection for hybrid breeding in wheat, maize, rye, barley, rice and triticale.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A breeding strategy with moderate nursery selection followed by genomic selection and one-stage phenotypic selection maximizes annual selection gain for grain yield across a wide range of hybrid breeding scenarios. Genomic selection (GS) is a promising method for the selection of quantitatively inherited traits but its most effective implementation in routine hybrid breeding schemes requires further research. We compared five breeding strategies and varied their available budget, the costs for doubled haploid (DH) line and hybrid seed production as well as variance components for grain yield in a wide range. In contrast to previous studies, we included a nursery selection for disease resistance just before GS on grain yield. The breeding strategy GSrapid with moderate nursery selection followed by one stage GS and one final stage with phenotypic selection on grain yield had the highest annual selection gain across all strategies, budgets, costs and variance components considered and we, therefore, highly recommend its use in hybrid breeding of cereals. Although selecting on traits not correlated with grain yield in the observation nursery, this selection reduced the selection gain of grain yield, especially in the breeding schemes with GS and for selected fractions smaller than 0.3. Owing to the very high number of test candidates entering breeding strategies with GS, the costs for DH line production had a larger impact on the annual selection gain than the hybrid seed production costs. The optimum allocation of test resources maximizing annual selection gain in classical two-stage phenotypic selection on grain yield and for the recommended breeding strategy GSrapid is finally explored for maize, wheat, rye, barley, rice and triticale.
27519313	Enhanced Salt Tolerance under Nitrate Nutrition is Associated with Apoplast Na+ Content in Canola (Brassica. napus L.) and Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Plants.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	To analyze the effect of nitrogen form on salt stress, we studied the response of two different plant species, canola (Brassica napus L.), a dicotyledon which prefers NO3- nutrition, and rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocotyledon which prefers NH4+ nutrition, to salt stress under NO3- (NN) and NH4+ (AN) nutrition. Salt stress was simulated by the addition of 150 and 100 mM NaCl to NN (NNS) and AN (ANS) in canola and rice seedlings, respectively. Salt stress induced reductions of shoot and root biomass that were more drastic under ANS. A higher Na+ content was obtained in NNS than in ANS. The impact of Na+ on the reduction of biomass (Δbiomass/Na+) was 162, 181, 230 and 245% higher in canola root, canola shoot, rice root and rice shoot in ANS than in NNS, respectively. In both canola and rice seedlings, the ratio of leaf Na+ content in apoplasts to symplasts ([Na+]apo/[Na+]sym) was higher in NNS than in ANS. Also, in canola seedlings, the ratio of apoplast Na+ in the leaf edge to the leaf center ([Na+]LE/[Na+]LC) was 18 times higher in NNS than in ANS. Our results illustrate that the confinement of Na+ in the canola leaf edge, as well as the restriction of Na+ in leaf apoplasts of canola and rice seedlings, protect cells from suffering Na+ stress and contribute to the higher tolerance of NO3--fed plants.
27568375	Parental Genome Imbalance Causes Post-Zygotic Seed Lethality and Deregulates Imprinting in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Reproductive isolation between rice of different ploidy levels is manifested as endosperm and embryo abortion in seeds produced by interploidy crosses. Genomic imprinting is considered to be the underlying mechanism establishing the post-zygotic hybridization barrier. We characterized disrupted seed development in reciprocal crosses between a diploid Japonica rice and a tetraploid Indica rice.

RESULTS: Triploid seeds from these crosses had aborted development and could not germinate in soil but could be rescued in culture medium with significantly more seeds developing to seedlings in the 4n × 2n (♀-♂) cross with excess maternal genomes than in the 2n × 4n cross with excess paternal genome. Consistent with previous findings, precocious endosperm cellularization and bigger embryos were observed in the seeds from the maternal excess cross, whereas absence of cellularization and arrested globular embryos were found in the seeds from the paternal excess cross, supporting the idea that endosperm cellularization is an important transition for embryo development. Moreover, we found that starch granules were persistently deposited in the pericarp parenchyma cells of the paternal excess cross, while pericarp starch gradually decreased and relocated to the developing endosperm in balanced and maternal excess crosses in which cellularization and starch deposition occur in endosperm, suggesting that parental genome balance influences pericarp starch relocation via cellularization and starch deposition. Loss of imprinting, or altered expression of imprinted genes and epigenetic regulators, OsFIE2 and OsMET1b were observed, implying the potential role of imprinting and epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the differential parental genome dosage effects on endosperm development.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the maternal genome dosage promotes endosperm cellularization and the paternal genome dosage delays or inhibits cellularization via contributing different sets of imprinted genes.
27542721	Transcriptome analysis of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel), a monocot halophyte, reveals candidate genes involved in its adaptation to salinity.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Soil salinity affects growth and yield of crop plants. Plants respond to salinity by physiological and biochemical adjustments through a coordinated regulation and expression of a cascade of genes. Recently, halophytes have attracted attention of the biologists to understand their salt adaptation mechanisms. Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) is a Louisiana native monocot halophyte that can withstand salinity up to double the strength of sea water. To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying its salinity adaptation, leaf and root transcriptome of S. alterniflora was sequenced using 454/GS-FLX.

RESULTS: Altogether, 770,690 high quality reads with an average length 324-bp were assembled de novo into 73,131 contigs (average 577-bp long) with 5.9X sequence coverage. Most unigenes (95 %) annotated to proteins with known functions, and had more than 90 % similarity to rice genes. About 28 % unigenes were considered specific to S. alterniflora. Digital expression profiles revealed significant enrichment (P < 0.01) of transporters, vacuolar proton pump members and transcription factors under salt stress, which suggested the role of ion homeostasis and transcriptional regulation in the salinity adaptation of this grass. Also, 10,805 SSRs markers from 9457 unigenes were generated and validated through genetic diversity analysis among 13 accessions of S. alterniflora.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study explores the transcriptome of S. alterniflora to understand the gene regulation under salt stress in halophytes. The sequenced transcriptome (control and salt-regulated) of S. alterniflora provides a platform for further gene finding studies in grasses. This study and our previously published studies suggested that S. alterniflora is a rich reservoir of salt tolerance genes that can be used to develop salt tolerant cereal crops, especially rice, a major food crop of global importance.
27563306	Evolution and Molecular Control of Hybrid Incompatibility in Plants.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) plays an important role in speciation. According to the stage at which it functions and the symptoms it displays, postzygotic RI can be called hybrid inviability, hybrid weakness or necrosis, hybrid sterility, or hybrid breakdown. In this review, we summarized new findings about hybrid incompatibilities in plants, most of which are from studies on Arabidopsis and rice. Recent progress suggests that hybrid incompatibility is a by-product of co-evolution either with "parasitic" selfish elements in the genome or with invasive microbes in the natural environment. We discuss the environmental influences on the expression of hybrid incompatibility and the possible effects of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibility on sympatric speciation. We also discuss the role of domestication on the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities.
27524161	Rapid changes in root hydraulic conductivity and aquaporin expression in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in response to shoot removal - xylem tension as a possible signal.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not clear how plants adjust the rate of root water uptake to that of shoot water loss. The aim of this study on rice was to test the idea that root aquaporins (AQPs) and xylem tension play a role in this adjustment.

METHODS: Three-week-old rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants, which were grown hydroponically, had their entire shoot system removed, and root hydraulic conductivity (exudation analyses) and gene expression (quantitative real-time PCR) of root plasma membrane intrinsic aquaporin proteins (PIPs) was followed within 60 min after shoot excision.

KEY RESULTS: All three PIP1 genes (OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2 and OsPIP1;3) and three of the six PIP2 genes tested (OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5) showed a rapid (5 min) and lasting (60 min) decrease in gene expression. Expression decreased by up to 85 % within 60 min. The other three PIP2 genes tested (OsPIP2;2, OsPIP2;3 and OsPIP2;6) showed a varied response, with expression decreasing either only initially (5 min) or after 60 min, or not changing at all. In a follow-up experiment, plants had their shoot system removed and the detached root system immediately connected to a vacuum pump through which some tension (80 kPa) was applied. This application of tension prevented any significant decrease in PIP expression.

CONCLUSIONS: Shoot removal leads to a rapid decrease in expression of all PIP1s and some PIP2s in roots of rice. Xylem tension plays some role in this process.
27497079	Selenate mitigates arsenite toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by reducing arsenic uptake and ameliorates amino acid content and thiol metabolism.	2016	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Arsenic (As) is a toxic element with the potential to cause health effects in humans. Besides rice is a source of both amino acids (AAs) and mineral nutrients, it is undesired source of As for billions of people consuming rice as the staple food. Selenium (Se) is an essential metalloid, which can regulate As toxicity by strengthening antioxidant potential. The present study was designed to investigate As(III) stress mitigating effect of Se(VI) in rice. The level of As, thiolic ligands and AAs was analyzed in rice seedlings after exposure to As(III)/Se(VI) alone and As(III)+Se(VI) treatments. Selenate supplementation (As(III) 25μM+Se(VI) 25μM) decreased total As accumulation in both root and shoot (179 & 144%) as compared to As(III) alone treatment. The As(III)+Se(VI) treatment also induced the levels of non-protein thiols (NPTs), glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs) as compared to As(III) alone treatment and also modulated the activity of enzymes of thiol metabolism. The content of amino acids (AAs) was significantly altered with Se(VI) supplementation. Importantly, essential amino acids (EAAs) were enhanced in As(III)+Se(VI) treatment as compared to As(III) alone treatment. In contrast, stress related non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) like GABA, Glu, Gly, Pro and Cys showed enhanced levels in As(III) alone treatment. In conclusion, rice supplemented with Se(VI) tolerated As toxicity with reduced As accumulation and increased the nutrition quality by increasing EAAs.
27573488	Comparison of eating quality and physicochemical properties between Japanese and Chinese rice cultivars.	2016	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	In this study, we evaluated 16 Japanese and Chinese rice cultivars in terms of their main chemical components, iodine absorption curve, apparent amylose content (AAC), pasting property, resistant starch content, physical properties, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and enzyme activity. Based on these quality evaluations, we concluded that Chinese rice varieties are characterized by a high protein and the grain texture after cooking has high hardness and low stickiness. In a previous study, we developed a novel formula for estimating AAC based on the iodine absorption curve. The validation test showed a determination coefficient of 0.996 for estimating AAC of Chinese rice cultivars as unknown samples. In the present study, we developed a novel formulae for estimating the balance degree of the surface layer of cooked rice (A3/A1: a ratio of workload of stickiness and hardness) based on the iodine absorption curve obtained using milled rice.
16040665	Functional redundancy of AtFtsH metalloproteases in thylakoid membrane complexes.	2005	Plant Physiol	FtsH is an ATP-dependent metalloprotease found in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains 12 AtFtsH proteins, three in the mitochondrion and nine in the chloroplast. Four of the chloroplast FtsH proteins are encoded by paired members of closely related genes (AtFtsH1 and 5, and AtFtsH2 and 8). We have previously reported that AtFtsH2 and 8 are interchangeable components of AtFtsH complexes in the thylakoid membrane. In this article, we show that the var1 variegation mutant, which is defective in AtFtsH5, has a coordinate reduction in the AtFtsH2 and 8 pair, and that the levels of both pairs are restored to normal in var1 plants that overexpress AtFtsH1. Overexpression of AtFtsH1, but not AtFtsH2/VAR2, normalizes the pattern of var1 variegation, restoring a nonvariegated phenotype. We conclude that AtFtsH proteins within a pair, but not between pairs, are interchangeable and functionally redundant, at least in part. We further propose that the abundance of each pair is matched with that of the other pair, with excess subunits being turned over. The variegation phenotype of var1 (as well as var2, which is defective in AtFtsH2) suggests that a threshold concentration of subunits is required for normal chloroplast function. AtFtsH1, 2, 5, and 8 do not show evidence of tissue or developmental specific expression. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis share a conserved core of seven FtsH subunit genes, including the AtFtsH1 and 5 and AtFtsH2 and 8 pairs, and that the structure of the present-day gene families can be explained by duplication events in each species following the monocot/dicot divergence.
20454772	Structure, allelic diversity and selection of Asr genes, candidate for drought tolerance, in Oryza sativa L. and wild relatives.	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Asr (ABA, stress, ripening) genes represent a small gene family potentially involved in drought tolerance in several plant species. To analyze their interest for rice breeding for water-limited environments, this gene family was characterized further. Genomic organization of the gene family reveals six members located on four different chromosomes and with the same exon-intron structure. The maintenance of six members of the Asr gene family, which are the result of combination between tandem duplication and whole genome duplication, and their differential regulation under water stress, involves probably some sub-functionalization. The polymorphism of four members was studied in a worldwide collection of 204 accessions of Oryza sativa L. and 14 accessions of wild relatives (O. rufipogon and O. nivara). The nucleotide diversity of the Asr genes was globally low, but contrasted for the different genes, leading to different shapes of haplotype networks. Statistical tests for neutrality were used and compared to their distribution in a set of 111 reference genes spread across the genome, derived from another published study. Asr3 diversity exhibited a pattern concordant with a balancing selection at the species level and with a directional selection in the tropical japonica sub-group. This study provides a thorough description of the organization of the Asr family, and the nucleotide and haplotype diversity of four Asr in Oryza sativa species. Asr3 stood out as the best potential candidate. The polymorphism detected here represents a first step towards an association study between genetic polymorphisms of this gene family and variation in drought tolerance traits.
19306571	[Cloning and function analysis of the rice small GTP-binding protein gene OsPra2].	2008	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	Gene expression in rice roots under nutritional stress was studied using micro array techniques. The results showed that when re-supplied with sufficient amounts of nutrition after nutrition stress, the expression of OsPra2 (a small G protein which is homologous with Pea Pra2 protein) decreased in the plants root tissue. The cDNA sequence of the OsPra2 gene and its promoter, which is about 1 kb upstream of the translation origin point, was obtained using RT-PCR and PCR approaches. The OsPra2 protein contains four conserved GTP/GDP binding domains and specific domain of Rab small G protein family. The expression of OsPra2 and GST fusion protein in onion epidermal cells showed that OsPra2 protein was localized in the membrane and nucleus of the cell. The fusion expression of OsPra2 promoter and GUS reporter gene in transgenic rice suggested that the OsPra2 promoter allowed GUS expression in coleoptiles and roots. Compared with wild type rice, OsPra2 over expressed transgenic rice showed an obvious dwarf phenotype which resembles the BR deficient rice.
20213442	Reverse genetics approach to characterize a function of NADH-glutamate synthase1 in rice plants.	2010	Amino Acids	Rice plants grown in anaerobic paddy soil prefer to use ammonium ion as an inorganic nitrogen source for their growth. The ammonium ions are assimilated by the coupled reaction of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT). In rice, there is a small gene family for GOGAT: there are two NADH-dependent types and one ferredoxin (Fd)-dependent type. Fd-GOGAT is important in the re-assimilation of photorespiratorily generated ammonium ions in chloroplasts. Although cell-type and age-dependent expression of two NADH-GOGAT genes has been well characterized, metabolic function of individual gene product is not fully understood. Reverse genetics approach is a direct way to characterize functions of isoenzymes. We have isolated a knockout rice mutant lacking NADH-dependent glutamate synthase1 (NADH-GOGAT1) and our studies show that this isoenzyme is important for primary ammonium assimilation in roots at the seedling stage. NADH-GOGAT1 is also important in the development of active tiller number, when the mutant was grown in paddy field until the harvest. Expression of NADH-GOGAT2 and Fd-GOGAT in the mutant was identical with that in wild-type, suggesting that these GOGATs are not able to compensate for NADH-GOGAT1 function.
27986805	Emergence of a Novel Chimeric Gene Underlying Grain Number in Rice.	2017	Genetics	Grain number is an important factor in determining grain production of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The molecular genetic basis for grain number is complex. Discovering new genes involved in regulating rice grain number increases our knowledge regarding its molecular mechanisms and aids breeding programs. Here, we identified GRAINS NUMBER 2 (GN2), a novel gene that is responsible for rice grain number, from "Yuanjiang" common wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.). Transgenic plants overexpressing GN2 showed less grain number, reduced plant height, and later heading date than control plants. Interestingly, GN2 arose through the insertion of a 1094-bp sequence from LOC_Os02g45150 into the third exon of LOC_Os02g56630, and the inserted sequence recruited its nearby sequence to generate the chimeric GN2 The gene structure and expression pattern of GN2 were distinct from those of LOC_Os02g45150 and LOC_Os02g56630 Sequence analysis showed that GN2 may be generated in the natural population of Yuanjiang common wild rice. In this study, we identified a novel functional chimeric gene and also provided information regarding the molecular mechanisms regulating rice grain number.
27965387	PMS1T, producing phased small-interfering RNAs, regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phased small-interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are a special class of small RNAs, which are generated in 21- or 24-nt intervals from transcripts of precursor RNAs. Although phasiRNAs have been found in a range of organisms, their biological functions in plants have yet to be uncovered. Here we show that phasiRNAs generated by the photopheriod-sensetive genic male sterility 1 (Pms1) locus were associated with photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) in rice, a germplasm that started the two-line hybrid rice breeding. The Pms1 locus encodes a long-noncoding RNA PMS1T that was preferentially expressed in young panicles. PMS1T was targeted by miR2118 to produce 21-nt phasiRNAs that preferentially accumulated in the PSMS line under long-day conditions. A single nucleotide polymorphism in PMS1T nearby the miR2118 recognition site was critical for fertility change, likely leading to differential accumulation of the phasiRNAs. This result suggested possible roles of phasiRNAs in reproductive development of rice, demonstrating the potential importance of this RNA class as regulators in biological processes.
27956642	DNA demethylation is initiated in the central cells of Arabidopsis and rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cytosine methylation is a DNA modification with important regulatory functions in eukaryotes. In flowering plants, sexual reproduction is accompanied by extensive DNA demethylation, which is required for proper gene expression in the endosperm, a nutritive extraembryonic seed tissue. Endosperm arises from a fusion of a sperm cell carried in the pollen and a female central cell. Endosperm DNA demethylation is observed specifically on the chromosomes inherited from the central cell in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and maize, and requires the DEMETER DNA demethylase in Arabidopsis DEMETER is expressed in the central cell before fertilization, suggesting that endosperm demethylation patterns are inherited from the central cell. Down-regulation of the MET1 DNA methyltransferase has also been proposed to contribute to central cell demethylation. However, with the exception of three maize genes, central cell DNA methylation has not been directly measured, leaving the origin and mechanism of endosperm demethylation uncertain. Here, we report genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in the central cells of Arabidopsis and rice-species that diverged 150 million years ago-as well as in rice egg cells. We find that DNA demethylation in both species is initiated in central cells, which requires DEMETER in Arabidopsis However, we do not observe a global reduction of CG methylation that would be indicative of lowered MET1 activity; on the contrary, CG methylation efficiency is elevated in female gametes compared with nonsexual tissues. Our results demonstrate that locus-specific, active DNA demethylation in the central cell is the origin of maternal chromosome hypomethylation in the endosperm.
28002408	Reducing phosphorus accumulation in rice grains with an impaired transporter in the node.	2017	Nature	Phosphorus is an important nutrient for crop productivity. More than 60% of the total phosphorus in cereal crops is finally allocated into the grains and is therefore removed at harvest. This removal accounts for 85% of the phosphorus fertilizers applied to the field each year. However, because humans and non-ruminants such as poultry, swine and fish cannot digest phytate, the major form of phosphorus in the grains, the excreted phosphorus causes eutrophication of waterways. A reduction in phosphorus accumulation in the grain would contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Here we describe a rice transporter, SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (SPDT), that controls the allocation of phosphorus to the grain. SPDT is expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus. Knockout of this gene in rice (Oryza sativa) altered the distribution of phosphorus, with decreased phosphorus in the grains but increased levels in the leaves. Total phosphorus and phytate in the brown de-husked rice were 20-30% lower in the knockout lines, whereas yield, seed germination and seedling vigour were not affected. These results indicate that SPDT functions in the rice node as a switch to allocate phosphorus preferentially to the grains. This finding provides a potential strategy to reduce the removal of phosphorus from the field and lower the risk of eutrophication of waterways.
27990147	Molecular Characterization of Rice <i>OsLCB2a1</i> Gene and Functional Analysis of its Role in Insect Resistance.	2016	Front Plant Sci	In plants, sphingolipids, such as long-chain bases (LCBs), act as bioactive molecules in stress responses. Until now, it is still not clear if these lipids are involved in biotic stress responses to herbivore. Herein we report that a rice LCB gene, OsLCB2a1 encoding a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a key enzyme responsible for the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids, plays a critical role in plant defense response to the brown planthopper (BPH) attack and that its up-regulation protects plants from herbivore infestation. Transcripts of OsLCB2a1 gene in rice seedlings were increased at 4 h, but decreased at 8-24 h after BPH attack. Sphingolipid measurement profiling revealed that overexpression of OsLCB2a1 in Arabidopsis thaliana increased trihydroxylated LCB phytosphingosine (t18:0) and phytoceramide by 1.7 and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared with that of wild type (WT) plants. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants also showed higher callose and wax deposition in leaves than that of WT. Overexpression of OsLCB2a1 gene in A. thaliana reduced the population size of green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Moreover, the electrical penetration graph (EPG) results indicated that the aphids encounter resistance factors while reaching for the phloem on the transgenic plants. The defense response genes related to salicylic acid signaling pathway, remained uplgulated in the OsLCB2a1-overexpressing transgenic plants. Our data highlight the key functions of OsLCB2a1 in biotic stress response in plants.
27935412	Rice OsERF71-mediated root modification affects shoot drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Drought is the most serious problem that impedes crop development and productivity worldwide. Although several studies have documented the root architecture adaption for drought tolerance, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our latest study demonstrated that overexpression of the OsERF71 in rice roots under drought conditions modifies root structure including larger aerenchyma and radial root growth, and thereby, protects the rice plants from drought stresses. The OsERF71-mediated root modifications are caused by combinatory overexpression of general stress-inducible, cell wall-associated and lignin biosynthesis genes that contribute to drought tolerance. Here we addressed that the OsERF71-mediated root modifications alter physiological capacity in shoots without evidence of developmental changes for drought tolerance. Thus, the OsERF71-mediated root modifications provide novel molecular insights into drought tolerance mechanisms.
28039904	The oxalyl-CoA synthetase-regulated oxalate and its distinct effects on resistance to bacterial blight and aluminium toxicity in rice.	2017	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Oxalic acid is widely distributed in biological systems and known to play functional roles in plants. The gene AAE3 was recently identified to encode an oxalyl-CoA synthetase (OCS) in Arabidopsis that catalyses the conversion of oxalate and CoA into oxalyl-CoA. It will be particularly important to characterise the homologous gene in rice since rice is not only a monocotyledonous model plant, but also a staple food crop. Various enzymatic and biological methods have been used to characterise the homologous gene. We first defined that AAE3 in the rice genome (OsAAE3) also encodes an OCS enzyme. Its Km for oxalate is 1.73 ± 0.12 mm, and Vm is 6824.9 ± 410.29 U·min-1 ·mg protein-1 . Chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis analyses identified thiols as the active site residues for rice OCS catalysis, suggesting that the enzyme might be regulated by redox state. Subcellular localisation assay showed that the enzyme is located in the cytosol and predominantly distributed in leaf epidermal cells. As expected, oxalate levels increased when OCS was suppressed in RNAi transgenic plants. More interestingly, OCS-suppressed plants were more susceptible to bacterial blight but more resistant to Al toxicity. The results demonstrate that the OsAAE3-encoded protein also acts as an OCS in rice, and may play different roles in coping with stresses. These molecular, enzymatic and functional data provide first-hand information to further clarify the function and mechanism of OCS in rice plants.
27992560	Knocking Down the Expression of GMPase Gene OsVTC1-1 Decreases Salt Tolerance of Rice at Seedling and Reproductive Stages.	2016	PLoS One	Salinity is a severe environmental stress that greatly impairs production of crops worldwide. Previous studies have shown that GMPase plays an important role in tolerance of plants to salt stress at vegetative stage. However, the function of GMPase in plant responses to salt stress at reproductive stage remains unclear. Studies have shown that heterologous expression of rice GMPase OsVTC1-1 enhanced salt tolerance of tobacco seedlings, but the native role of OsVTC1-1 in salt stress tolerance of rice is unknown. To illustrate the native function of GMPase in response of rice to salt stress, OsVTC1-1 expression was suppressed using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Suppressing OsVTC1-1 expression obviously decreased salt tolerance of rice varieties at vegetative stage. Intriguingly, grain yield of OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice was also significantly reduced under salt stress, indicating that OsVTC1-1 plays an important role in salt tolerance of rice at both seedling and reproductive stages. OsVTC1-1 RNAi rice accumulated more ROS under salt stress, and supplying exogenous ascorbic acid restored salt tolerance of OsVTC1-1 RNAi lines, suggesting that OsVTC1-1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice through the biosynthesis regulation of ascorbic acid. Altogether, results of present study showed that rice GMPase gene OsVTC1-1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance of rice at both vegetative and reproductive stages through AsA scavenging of excess ROS.
28013008	Independent metal-thiolate cluster formation in C-terminal Cys-rich region of a rice type 1 metallothionein isoform.	2017	Int J Biol Macromol	In this study we examined the independent self assembly of metal-binding in C-terminal Cys- rich region of a type 1 metallothionein (MT) isoform from rice (OsMTI-1b). To this end the N-terminal of OsMTI-1b (C-OsMTI-1b) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). As compared with control (The E. coli cells containing pET41a without gene), transgenic E. coli cells expressing GST-C-OsMTI-1b accumulated more Ni2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ from culture medium and showed increased tolerance against these metals. The recombinant GST-C-OsMTI-1b was purified using affinity chromatography. According to in vitro assays the protein GST-C-OsMTI-1b was able to form complexes with Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+. These results demonstrate the formation of independent metal-thiolate cluster at C-terminal Cys-rich region of OsMTI-1b without participation of N-terminal Cys-rich region.
27917884	OsSGL, a novel pleiotropic stress-related gene enhances grain length and yield in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Abiotic stress seriously affects the yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Grain yield in rice is multiplicatively determined by the number of panicles, number of grains per panicle, and grain weight. Here, we describe the molecular and functional characterization of STRESS_tolerance and GRAIN_LENGTH (OsSGL), a rice gene strongly up-regulated by a wide spectrum of abiotic stresses. OsSGL encodes a putative member of the DUF1645 protein family of unknown function. Overexpression of OsSGL significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield. Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced OsSGL expression promoted cell division and grain filling. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that a large number of genes involved in stress-response, cell cycle and cytokinin signaling processes were induced or suppressed in OsSGL-overexpressing plants. Together, our results suggest that OsSGL may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the underlying mechanism regulating rice stress-tolerance and grain length, but also provides a strategy for tailor-made crop yield improvement.
27940269	Hydrogen sulfide alleviates mercury toxicity by sequestering it in roots or regulating reactive oxygen species productions in rice seedlings.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Soil mercury (Hg) contamination is a major factor that affects agricultural yield and food security. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays multifunctional roles in mediating a variety of responses to abiotic stresses. The effects of exogenous H2S on rice (Oryza sativa var 'Nipponbare') growth and metabolism under mercuric chloride (HgCl2) stress were investigated in this study. Either 100 or 200 μM sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H2S) pretreatment improved the transcription of bZIP60, a membrane-associated transcription factor, and then enhanced the expressions of non-protein thiols (NPT) and metallothioneins (OsMT-1) to sequester Hg in roots and thus inhibit Hg transport to shoots. Meanwhile, H2S promoted seedlings growth significantly even in the presences of Hg and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) or catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) inhibitors, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT). H2S might act as an antioxidant to inhibit or scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) productions for maintaining the lower MDA and H2O2 levels, and thereby preventing oxidative damages. All these results indicated H2S effectively alleviated Hg toxicity by sequestering it in roots or by regulating ROS in seedlings and then thus significantly promoted rice growth.
28025520	Plastoglobule-Targeting Competence of a Putative Transit Peptide Sequence from Rice Phytoene Synthase 2 in Plastids.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Plastoglobules (PGs) are thylakoid membrane microdomains within plastids that are known as specialized locations of carotenogenesis. Three rice phytoene synthase proteins (OsPSYs) involved in carotenoid biosynthesis have been identified. Here, the N-terminal 80-amino-acid portion of OsPSY2 (PTp) was demonstrated to be a chloroplast-targeting peptide by displaying cytosolic localization of OsPSY2(ΔPTp):mCherry in rice protoplast, in contrast to chloroplast localization of OsPSY2:mCherry in a punctate pattern. The peptide sequence of a PTp was predicted to harbor two transmembrane domains eligible for a putative PG-targeting signal. To assess and enhance the PG-targeting ability of PTp, the original PTp DNA sequence (PTp) was modified to a synthetic DNA sequence (stPTp), which had 84.4% similarity to the original sequence. The motivation of this modification was to reduce the GC ratio from 75% to 65% and to disentangle the hairpin loop structures of PTp. These two DNA sequences were fused to the sequence of the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) and drove GFP expression with different efficiencies. In particular, the RNA and protein levels of stPTp-sGFP were slightly improved to 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold more than those of sGFP, respectively. The green fluorescent signals of their mature proteins were all observed as speckle-like patterns with slightly blurred stromal signals in chloroplasts. These discrete green speckles of PTp-sGFP and stPTp-sGFP corresponded exactly to the red fluorescent signal displayed by OsPSY2:mCherry in both etiolated and greening protoplasts and it is presumed to correspond to distinct PGs. In conclusion, we identified PTp as a transit peptide sequence facilitating preferential translocation of foreign proteins to PGs, and developed an improved PTp sequence, a stPTp, which is expected to be very useful for applications in plant biotechnologies requiring precise micro-compartmental localization in plastids.
28000793	Root transcriptome of two contrasting indica rice cultivars uncovers regulators of root development and physiological responses.	2016	Sci Rep	The huge variation in root system architecture (RSA) among different rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars is conferred by their genetic makeup and different growth or climatic conditions. Unlike model plant Arabidopsis, the molecular basis of such variation in RSA is very poorly understood in rice. Cultivars with stable variation are valuable resources for identification of genes involved in RSA and related physiological traits. We have screened for RSA and identified two such indica rice cultivars, IR-64 (OsAS83) and IET-16348 (OsAS84), with stable contrasting RSA. OsAS84 produces robust RSA with more crown roots, lateral roots and root hairs than OsAS83. Using comparative root transcriptome analysis of these cultivars, we identified genes related to root development and different physiological responses like abiotic stress responses, hormone signaling, and nutrient acquisition or transport. The two cultivars differ in their response to salinity/dehydration stresses, phosphate/nitrogen deficiency, and different phytohormones. Differential expression of genes involved in salinity or dehydration response, nitrogen (N) transport, phosphate (Pi) starvation signaling, hormone signaling and root development underlies more resistance of OsAS84 towards abiotic stresses, Pi or N deficiency and its robust RSA. Thus our study uncovers gene-network involved in root development and abiotic stress responses in rice.

28066457	<i>OsMADS1</i> Represses microRNA172 in Elongation of Palea/Lemma Development in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Specification of floral organ identity is critical for the establishment of floral morphology and inflorescence architecture. Although multiple genes are involved in the regulation of floral organogenesis, our understanding of the underlying regulating network is still fragmentary. MADs-box genes are principle members in the ABCDE model that characterized floral organs. OsMADS1 specifies the determinacy of spikelet meristem and lemma/palea identity in rice. However, the pathway through which OsMADS1 regulates floral organs remains elusive; here, we identified the microRNA172 (miR172) family as possible regulators downstream of OsMADS1. Genetic study revealed that overexpression of each miR172 gene resulted in elongated lemma/palea and indeterminacy of the floret, which resemble the phenotype of osmads1 mutant. On the contrary, overexpression of each target APETALA2 (AP2) genes resulted in shortened palea/lemma. Expression level and specificity of miR172 was greatly influenced by OsMADS1, as revealed by Northern blot analysis and In situ hybridization. Genetically, AP2-3 and AP2-2 over expression rescued the elongation and inconsistent development of the lemma/palea in OsMADS1RNAi transgenic plants. Our results suggested that in rice, OsMADS1 and miR172s/AP2s formed a regulatory network involved in floral organ development, particularly the elongation of the lemma and the palea.
28029278	A novel trimeric complex in plant cells that contributes to the lamina inclination of rice.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	The architecture determining grain production in rice is mainly affected by factors such as lamina angle, tillering, plant height and panicle morphology. In particular, leaf angle, the degree of bending between the leaf blade and leaf sheath directly affects crop architecture and grain yields. Balancing activities between the 2 antagonistic groups of proteins, atypical helix-loop-helix (HLH) and basic HLH (bHLH) proteins have been regarded as one of the major molecular machineries regulating lamina angles through the control of cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Recently, formation of a complex consisting of atypical HLH protein, OsBUL1, a KxDL motif-containing protein, LO9-177 and a bHLH protein, OsBC1 has been reported to play a positive role in lamina inclination of rice unraveling a novel layer of cell elongation control in rice lamina joint. Here, we demonstrate a trimeric complex formation in rice cells by a combination of BiFC and FRET-FLIM assays.
28013072	Expression of α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) in rice grain and immunogenicity evaluation of plant-specific glycans.	2017	J Biotechnol	Rice seed is a cost-effective bioreactor for the large-scale production of pharmaceuticals. However, convincing evidence of the immunogenicity of plant-specific glycans is still limited although plant-specific glycans are considered potential allergic antigens. In the present study, we found that the α-1,3-fucose content of the glycoprotein produced from rice seed was much lower than that in leaf, and conversely, a higher β-1,2-xylose content was detected in seed than that in leaf. We detected the α-1,6-fucose content in the glutelin and recombinant human α1-antitrypsin (OsrAAT). The further results in a line containing AAT and FUT8 genes indicated that the α-1,6-fucose content of modified glycosylated recombinant α1-antitrypsin (mgOsrAAT) was 38.4%, while glutelin was only 6.8%. Interestingly, the α-1,3-fucose content of mgOsrAAT was significantly reduced by 59.8% compared with that of OsrAAT. Furthermore, we assessed the immunogenicity of OsrAAT, mgOsrAAT and human α1-antitrypsin (hAAT) using an animal system. The PCA results indicated no significant differences in the IgG, IgM and IgE titers among OsrAAT, mgOsrAAT and hAAT. Further studies revealed that those antibodies were mainly from α-1,3-fucose, but not from β-1,2-xylose, indicating that α-1,3-fucose was the major immunogenic resource. Our results demonstrated that α-1,3-fucose contents in seed proteins was much less than that of leaf, and could not be a plant-specific glycan because it also exists in human proteins.
27913740	A β-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor.	2017	Plant Physiol	Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) wax crystal-sparse leaf 4 (WSL4) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. WSL4 is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CER6. Complementation of the mutant wsl4-1 with WSL4 genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of WSL4 The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in wsl4-1 and wsl4-2 mutants, respectively. Overexpression of WSL4 increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of WSL4 alone in elo3 yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing OsCER2 alone showed no effect. Coexpression of WSL4 and OsCER2 in elo3 yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in elo3 yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.
27924841	Virus altered rice attractiveness to planthoppers is mediated by volatiles and related to virus titre and expression of defence and volatile-biosynthesis genes.	2016	Sci Rep	Viruses may induce changes in plant hosts and vectors to enhance their transmission. The white-backed planthopper (WBPH) and brown planthopper (BPH) are vectors of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) and Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), respectively, which cause serious rice diseases. We herein describe the effects of SRBSDV and RRSV infections on host-selection behaviour of vector and non-vector planthoppers at different disease stages. The Y-tube olfactometer choice and free-choice tests indicated that SRBSDV and RRSV infections altered the attractiveness of rice plants to vector and non-vector planthoppers. The attractiveness was mainly mediated by rice volatiles, and varied with disease progression. The attractiveness of the SRBSDV- or RRSV-infected rice plants to the virus-free WBPHs or BPHs initially decreased, then increased, and finally decreased again. For the viruliferous WBPHs and BPHs, SRBSDV or RRSV infection increased the attractiveness of plants more for the non-vector than for the vector planthoppers. Furthermore, we observed that the attractiveness of infected plants to planthoppers was positively correlated with the virus titres. The titre effects were greater for virus-free than for viruliferous planthoppers. Down-regulated defence genes OsAOS1, OsICS, and OsACS2 and up-regulated volatile-biosynthesis genes OsLIS, OsCAS, and OsHPL3 expression in infected plants may influence their attractiveness.
28000033	The protein phosphatase 2C clade A protein OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination by directly inactivating OsbZIP10.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Protein phosphatase 2C clade A members are major signaling components in the ABA-dependent signaling cascade that regulates seed germination. To elucidate the role of PP2CA genes in germination of rice seed, we selected OsPP2C51, which shows highly specific expression in the embryo compared with other protein phosphatases based on microarray data. GUS histochemical assay confirmed that OsPP2C51 is expressed in the seed embryo and that this expression pattern is unique compared with those of other OsPP2CA genes. Data obtained from germination assays and alpha-amylase assays of OsPP2C51 knockout and overexpression lines suggest that OsPP2C51 positively regulates seed germination in rice. The expression of alpha-amylase synthesizing genes was high in OsPP2C51 overexpressing plants, suggesting that elevated levels of OsPP2C51 might enhance gene expression related to higher rates of seed germination. Analysis of protein interactions between ABA signaling components showed that OsPP2C51 interacts with OsPYL/RCAR5 in an ABA-dependent manner. Furthermore, interactions were observed between OsPP2C51 and SAPK2, and between OsPP2C51 and OsbZIP10 and we found out that OsPP2C51 can dephosphorylates OsbZIP10. These findings suggest the existence of a new branch in ABA signaling pathway consisting of OsPYL/RCAR-OsPP2C-bZIP apart from the previously reported OsPYL/RCAR-OsPP2C-SAPK-bZIP. Overall, our result suggests that OsPP2C51 is a positive regulator of seed germination by directly suppressing active phosphorylated OsbZIP10.
27864513	Construction of a male sterility system for hybrid rice breeding and seed production using a nuclear male sterility gene.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The breeding and large-scale adoption of hybrid seeds is an important achievement in agriculture. Rice hybrid seed production uses cytoplasmic male sterile lines or photoperiod/thermo-sensitive genic male sterile lines (PTGMS) as female parent. Cytoplasmic male sterile lines are propagated via cross-pollination by corresponding maintainer lines, whereas PTGMS lines are propagated via self-pollination under environmental conditions restoring male fertility. Despite huge successes, both systems have their intrinsic drawbacks. Here, we constructed a rice male sterility system using a nuclear gene named Oryza sativa No Pollen 1 (OsNP1). OsNP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase regulating tapetum degeneration and pollen exine formation; it is specifically expressed in the tapetum and miscrospores. The osnp1 mutant plant displays normal vegetative growth but complete male sterility insensitive to environmental conditions. OsNP1 was coupled with an α-amylase gene to devitalize transgenic pollen and the red fluorescence protein (DsRed) gene to mark transgenic seed and transformed into the osnp1 mutant. Self-pollination of the transgenic plant carrying a single hemizygous transgene produced nontransgenic male sterile and transgenic fertile seeds in 1:1 ratio that can be sorted out based on the red fluorescence coded by DsRed Cross-pollination of the fertile transgenic plants to the nontransgenic male sterile plants propagated the male sterile seeds of high purity. The male sterile line was crossed with ∼1,200 individual rice germplasms available. Approximately 85% of the F1s outperformed their parents in per plant yield, and 10% out-yielded the best local cultivars, indicating that the technology is promising in hybrid rice breeding and production.
27803308	GOLGI TRANSPORT 1B Regulates Protein Export from the Endoplasmic Reticulum in Rice Endosperm Cells.	2016	Plant Cell	Coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates the first step of anterograde transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other endomembrane compartments in eukaryotes. A group of evolutionarily conserved proteins (Sar1, Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31) constitutes the basic COPII coat machinery; however, the details of how the COPII coat assembly is regulated remain unclear. Here, we report a protein transport mutant of rice (Oryza sativa), named glutelin precursor accumulation4 (gpa4), which accumulates 57-kD glutelin precursors and forms two types of ER-derived abnormal structures. GPA4 encodes the evolutionarily conserved membrane protein GOT1B (also known as GLUP2), homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GOT1p. The rice GOT1B protein colocalizes with Arabidopsis thaliana Sar1b at Golgi-associated ER exit sites (ERESs) when they are coexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana Moreover, GOT1B physically interacts with rice Sec23, and both proteins are present in the same complex(es) with rice Sar1b. The distribution of rice Sar1 in the endomembrane system, its association with rice Sec23c, and the ERES organization pattern are significantly altered in the gpa4 mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that GOT1B plays an important role in mediating COPII vesicle formation at ERESs, thus facilitating anterograde transport of secretory proteins in plant cells.
27889517	Rice pectin methylesterase inhibitor28 (OsPMEI28) encodes a functional PMEI and its overexpression results in a dwarf phenotype through increased pectin methylesterification levels.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Pectin methylesterases (PMEs, EC 3.1.1.11) belonging to carbohydrate esterase family 8 cleave the ester bond between a galacturonic acid and an methyl group and the resulting change in methylesterification level plays an important role during the growth and development of plants. Optimal pectin methylesterification status in each cell type is determined by the balance between PME activity and post-translational PME inhibition by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Rice contains 49 PMEIs and none of them are functionally characterized. Genomic sequence analysis led to the identification of rice PMEI28 (OsPMEI28). Recombinant OsPMEI28 exhibited inhibitory activity against commercial PME protein with the highest activities detected at pH 8.5. Overexpression of OsPMEI28 in rice resulted in an increased level of cell wall bound methylester groups and differential changes in the composition of cell wall neutral monosaccharides and lignin content in culm tissues. Consequently, transgenic plants overexpressing OsPMEI28 exhibited dwarf phenotypes and reduced culm diameter. Our data indicate that OsPMEI28 functions as a critical structural modulator by regulating the degree of pectin methylesterification and that an impaired status of pectin methylesterification affects physiochemical properties of the cell wall components and causes abnormal cell extensibility in rice culm tissues.
27878661	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: OsPHR4 mediates the regulation of Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis in a PHR1-subfamily dependent manner in rice. Phosphate (Pi) starvation response is a sophisticated process for plant in the natural environment. In this process, PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) subfamily genes play a central role in regulating Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis. Besides the three PHR1 orthologs in Oryza sativa L. (Os) [(Os) PHR1, (Os) PHR2, and (Os) PHR3], which were reported to regulated Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis redundantly, a close related PHR1 ortholog [designated as (Os) PHR4] is presented in rice genome with unknown function. In this study, we found that OsPHR4 is a Pi-starvation induced gene and mainly expresses in vascular tissues through all growth and development periods. The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3. The nuclear located OsPHR4 can respectively interact with other three PHR1 subfamily members to regulate downstream Pi-starvation induced genes. Consistent with the positive role of PHR4 in regulating Pi-starvation signaling, the OsPHR4 overexpressors display higher Pi accumulation in the shoot and elevated expression of Pi-starvation induced genes under Pi-sufficient condition. Besides, moderate growth retardation and repression of the Pi-starvation signaling in the OsPHR4 RNA interfering (RNAi) transgenic lines can be observed under Pi-deficient condition. Together, we propose that OsPHR4 mediates the regulation of Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis in a PHR1-subfamily dependent manner in rice.
27627618	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	The drought-induced 19 protein family consists of several atypical Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins in plants and plays an important role in abiotic stress. In this study, we found that overexpressing OsDi19-4 in rice altered the expression of a series of abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes, resulting in strong ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes including ABA-induced seed germination inhibition, early seedling growth inhibition and stomatal closure. On the contrary, OsDi19-4 knockdown lines were less sensitive to ABA. Additionally, OsCDPK14 was identified to interact with OsDi19-4 and be responsible for the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4, and the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 was further enhanced after the treatment of ABA. Apart from these, OsDi19-4 was shown to directly bind to the promoters of OsASPG1 and OsNAC18 genes, two ABA-responsive genes, and regulate their expression. Transient expression assays confirmed the direct regulation role of OsDi19-4, and the regulation was further enhanced by the increased phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 after the treatment of ABA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response by modulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes in rice.
27875019	Generation of targeted mutant rice using a CRISPR-Cpf1 system.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	CRISPR-Cpf1 is a newly identified CRISPR-Cas system, and Cpf1 was recently engineered as a molecular tool for targeted genome editing in mammalian cells. To test whether the engineered CRISPR-Cpf1 system could induce the production of rice mutants, we selected two genome targets in the OsPDS and OsBEL genes. Our results show that both targets could be efficiently mutated in transgenic rice plants using CRISPR-Cpf1. We found that pre-crRNAs with a full-length direct repeat sequence exhibited considerably increased efficiencies compared with mature crRNAs. In addition, the specificity and transmission of the mutation were investigated, and the behaviours of crRNA-Cpf1-induced plant targeted genome mutagenesis were assessed. Taken together, our results indicate that CRISPR-Cpf1 expression via stable transformation can efficiently generate specific and heritable targeted mutations in rice and thereby constitutes a novel and important approach to specific and precise plant genome editing.
27897241	Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly conserved signaling modules in eukaryotes, transmitting signals from upstream receptor to downstream target by phosphorelay mechanism. Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice. X. oryzae infection resulted in induction of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3. OsMKK3 was found to physically interact and phosphorylate OsMPK7. Overexpression of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3, individually and in combinations resulted in inhibition of disease symptoms caused by X. oryzae, however silencing of OsMPK7 resulted in disease susceptibility. Furthermore, OsWRKY30 was identified as downstream target of OsMPK7 through protein-protein interaction techniques and was found to be a positive regulator of defence response against X. oryzae pathogen. The overexpression of OsMKK3-OsMPK7 upregulated genes involved in pathogenesis, cell wall structure maintenance and cell metabolism indicating possible mechanism of disease resistance. These leaves also showed restricted movement of the pathogen from the point of infection to uninfected area. Taken together, this work suggests a positive involvement of OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRKY30 module in imparting disease resistance against X. oryzae infection in rice.
27965699	Genome-Wide Association Study for Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice under Contrasting Moisture Regimes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Drought is one of the vitally critical environmental stresses affecting both growth and yield potential in rice. Drought resistance is a complicated quantitative trait that is regulated by numerous small effect loci and hundreds of genes controlling various morphological and physiological responses to drought. For this study, 270 rice landraces and cultivars were analyzed for their drought resistance. This was done via determination of changes in plant height and grain yield under contrasting water regimes, followed by detailed identification of the underlying genetic architecture via genome-wide association study (GWAS). We controlled population structure by setting top two eigenvectors and combining kinship matrix for GWAS in this study. Eighteen, five, and six associated loci were identified for plant height, grain yield per plant, and drought resistant coefficient, respectively. Nine known functional genes were identified, including five for plant height (OsGA2ox3, OsGH3-2, sd-1, OsGNA1, and OsSAP11/OsDOG), two for grain yield per plant (OsCYP51G3 and OsRRMh) and two for drought resistant coefficient (OsPYL2 and OsGA2ox9), implying very reliable results. A previous study reported OsGNA1 to regulate root development, but this study reports additional controlling of both plant height and root length. Moreover, OsRLK5 is a new drought resistant candidate gene discovered in this study. OsRLK5 mutants showed faster water loss rates in detached leaves. This gene plays an important role in the positive regulation of yield-related traits under drought conditions. We furthermore discovered several new loci contributing to the three investigated traits (plant height, grain yield, and drought resistance). These associated loci and candidate genes significantly improve our knowledge of the genetic control of these traits in rice. In addition, many drought resistant cultivars screened in this study can be used as parental genotypes to improve drought resistance of rice by molecular breeding.
27803124	Rice aleurone layer specific OsNF-YB1 regulates grain filling and endosperm development by interacting with an ERF transcription factor.	2016	J Exp Bot	Grain yield and quality of rice mainly depend on grain filling and endosperm development. Here we report that a rice NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factor, OsNF-YB1, is specifically expressed in the aleurone layer of developing endosperm and regulates grain filling and endosperm development. Knockdown of OsNF-YB1 expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality. Whereas OsNF-YB1 shows subcellular localization in both the cytosol and the nucleus in roots, it was specifically targeted to the nucleus of aleurone layer cells, which was facilitated by interacting with OsNF-YC proteins preferentially expressed in the aleurone layer. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to membrane transport and ATP biosynthesis were enriched in the down-regulated category in OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants, which is consistent with the crucial role of OsNF-YB1 in rice grain filling and endosperm development. Identification of the genome-wide targets of OsNF-YB1 by ChIP sequencing showed that OsNF-YB1 directly regulates genes involved in the transport of nutrients such as sugar and amino acids. Interestingly, different from the binding sites reported for other NF-Y complexes, the GCC box, the binding motif of ERF transcription factors, was enriched in the binding peaks of OsNF-YB1. Indeed, further analyses confirmed the interaction of OsERF#115 with OsNF-YB1, and OsERF#115 directly binds to the GCC box. It is proposed that OsNF-YB1 specifically regulate the transcription of downstream genes during rice endosperm development by forming protein complexes consisting of OsNF-YB1, OsNF-YC and ERF, providing informative insights into the molecular functional mechanisms of the NF-Y factor.
27813190	The STN8 kinase-PBCP phosphatase system is responsible for high-light-induced reversible phosphorylation of the PSII inner antenna subunit CP29 in rice.	2017	Plant J	Reversible phosphorylation of thylakoid light-harvesting proteins is a mechanism to compensate for unbalanced excitation of photosystem I (PSI) versus photosystem II (PSII) under limiting light. In monocots, an additional phosphorylation event on the PSII antenna CP29 occurs upon exposure to excess light, enhancing resistance to light stress. Different from the case of the major LHCII antenna complex, the STN7 kinase and its related PPH1 phosphatase were proven not to be involved in CP29 phosphorylation, indicating that a different set of enzymes act in the high-light (HL) response. Here, we analyze a rice stn8 mutant in which both PSII core proteins and CP29 phosphorylation are suppressed in HL, implying that STN8 is the kinase catalyzing this reaction. In order to identify the phosphatase involved, we produced a recombinant enzyme encoded by the rice ortholog of AtPBCP, antagonist of AtSTN8, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PSII core proteins. The recombinant protein was active in dephosphorylating P-CP29. Based on these data, we propose that the activities of the OsSTN8 kinase and the antagonistic OsPBCP phosphatase, in addition to being involved in the repair of photo-damaged PSII, are also responsible for the HL-dependent reversible phosphorylation of the inner antenna CP29.
27892643	The rice OsNAC6 transcription factor orchestrates multiple molecular mechanisms involving root structural adaptions and nicotianamine biosynthesis for drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought has a serious impact on agriculture worldwide. A plant's ability to adapt to rhizosphere drought stress requires reprogramming of root growth and development. Although physiological studies have documented the root adaption for tolerance to the drought stress, underlying molecular mechanisms is still incomplete, which is essential for crop engineering. Here, we identified OsNAC6-mediated root structural adaptations, including increased root number and root diameter, which enhanced drought tolerance. Multiyear drought field tests demonstrated that the grain yield of OsNAC6 root-specific overexpressing transgenic rice lines was less affected by drought stress than were nontransgenic controls. Genome-wide analyses of loss- and gain-of-function mutants revealed that OsNAC6 up-regulates the expression of direct target genes involved in membrane modification, nicotianamine (NA) biosynthesis, glutathione relocation, 3'-phophoadenosine 5'-phosphosulphate accumulation and glycosylation, which represent multiple drought tolerance pathways. Moreover, overexpression of NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE genes, direct targets of OsNAC6, promoted the accumulation of the metal chelator NA and, consequently, drought tolerance. Collectively, OsNAC6 orchestrates novel molecular drought tolerance mechanisms and has potential for the biotechnological development of high-yielding crops under water-limiting conditions.
27878652	Genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analysis of the chalcone synthase gene family in rice.	2017	J Plant Res	The enzymes of the chalcone synthase family are also known as type III polyketide synthases (PKS), and produce a series of secondary metabolites in bacteria, fungi and plants. In a number of plants, genes encoding PKS comprise a large multigene family. Currently, detailed reports on rice (Oryza sativa) PKS (OsPKS) family genes and tissue expression profiling are limited. Here, 27 candidate OsPKS genes were identified in the rice genome,and 23 gene structures were confirmed by EST and cDNA sequencing; phylogenetic analysis has indicated that these 23 OsPKS members could be clustered into three groups (I-III). Comparative analysis has shown OsPKS08 and OsPKS26 could be classified with the CHS genes of other species. Two members OsPKS10 and OsPKS21 were grouped into anther specific chalcone synthase-like (ASCL) clade. Intron/exon structure analysis revealed that nearly all of the OsPKS members contained one phase-1 intron at a conserved Cys. Analysis of chromosomal localization and genome distribution showed that some of the members were distributed on a chromosome as a cluster. Expression data exhibited widespread distribution of the rice OsPKS gene family within plant tissues, suggesting functional diversification of the OsPKS genes. Our results will contribute to future study of the complexity of the OsPKS gene family in rice.
27888467	OsWRKY80-OsWRKY4 Module as a Positive Regulatory Circuit in Rice Resistance Against Rhizoctonia solani.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Plant WRKY transcription factors play pivotal roles in diverse biological processes but most notably in plant defense response to pathogens. Sheath blight represents one of the predominant diseases in rice. However, our knowledge about the functions of WRKY proteins in rice defense against sheath blight is rather limited.

RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the expression of Oryza sativa WRKY80 gene (OsWRKY80) is rapidly and strongly induced upon infection of Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of rice sheath blight disease. OsWRKY80 expression is also induced by exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), but not by salicylic acid (SA). OsWRKY80-GFP is localized in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells in a transient expression assay. Consistently, OsWRKY80 exhibits transcriptional activation activity in a GAL4 assay in yeast cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY80 in rice plants significantly enhanced disease resistance to R. solani, concomitant with elevated expression of OsWRKY4, another positive regulator in rice defense against R. solani. Suppression of OsWRKY80 by RNA interference (RNAi), on the other hand, compromised disease resistance to R. solani. Results of yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression assay in tobacco cells have revealed that OsWRKY80 specifically binds to the promoter regions of OsWRKY4, which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]) or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements.

CONCLUSIONS: We propose that OsWRKY80 functions upstream of OsWRKY4 as an important positive regulatory circuit that is implicated in rice defense response to sheath blight pathogen R. solani.
27832344	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the OsPsbR gene family in rice.	2017	Mol Genet Genomics	Low temperature may exert a negative impact on agronomical productivity. PsbR was known as the 10 kDa Photosystem II polypeptide. Although plant PsbR is thought to play important roles in photosynthesis, little is known about the contribution of plant PsbR to abiotic stress resistance. The expression patterns of three OsPsbR gene family members, OsPsbR1, OsPsbR2, and OsPsbR3, were characterized in rice 'Nipponbare'. Under normal condition, OsPsbR1 and OsPsbR3 showed tissue-specific expression, while the expression of OsPsbR2 could not be detected in all tested tissues. OsPsbR1 was upregulated in response to cold stress, and downregulated under drought, salt, or heat conditions. The upregulation of OsPsbR3 was observed under the treatment of ABA, and its downregulation was detected under drought or heat conditions. Upregulation of OsPsbR1 in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to cold, but did not affect the yield of rice. Furthermore, after 8 h cold-stress treatment, the expression levels of three cold stress-induced marker genes were significantly higher in the overexpression lines L11 and L19 in comparison with the wild type. All these results suggest that OsPsbR1 may play key roles in photosynthesis and cold stress response and thus has the potential to improve cold stress tolerance of crops.
27879391	Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex.	2017	Plant Physiol	Rice atypical HLH protein Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1-LIKE1 (OsBUL1) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. OsBUL1 knockout mutant (osbul1) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of OsBUL1 produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas OsBUL1 overexpressors and an activation tagging line of OsBUL1 exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain size. Moreover, OsBUL1 expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and osbul1 did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of OsBC1 is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of OsBUL1 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.
27820840	Transcriptomic Analysis of Responses to Imbalanced Carbon: Nitrogen Availabilities in Rice Seedlings.	2016	PLoS One	The internal C:N balance must be tightly controlled for the normal growth and development of plants. However, the underlying mechanisms, by which plants sense and balance the intracellular C:N status correspondingly to exogenous C:N availabilities remain elusive. In this study, we use comparative gene expression analysis to identify genes that are responsive to imbalanced C:N treatments in the aerial parts of rice seedlings. Transcripts of rice seedlings treated with four C:N availabilities (1:1, 1:60, 60:1 and 60:60) were compared and two groups of genes were classified: high C:low N responsive genes and low C:high N responsive genes. Our analysis identified several functional correlated genes including chalcone synthase (CHS), chlorophyll a-b binding protein (CAB) and other genes that are implicated in C:N balancing mechanism, such as alternative oxidase 1B (OsAOX1B), malate dehydrogenase (OsMDH) and lysine and histidine specific transporter 1 (OsLHT1). Additionally, six jasmonate synthetic genes and key regulatory genes involved in abiotic and biotic stresses, such as OsMYB4, autoinhibited calcium ATPase 3 (OsACA3) and pleiotropic drug resistance 9 (OsPDR9), were differentially expressed under high C:low N treatment. Gene ontology analysis showed that high C:low N up-regulated genes were primarily enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis and defense responses. Coexpression network analysis of these genes identified eight jasmonate ZIM domain protein (OsJAZ) genes and several defense response related regulators, suggesting that high C:low N status may act as a stress condition, which induces defense responses mediated by jasmonate signaling pathway. Our transcriptome analysis shed new light on the C:N balancing mechanisms and revealed several important regulators of C:N status in rice seedlings.
27864442	Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	Acetylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how crop plants accomplish cell wall polymer O-acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two trichome birefringence-like (tbl) mutants in rice (Oryza sativa), which are affected in xylan O-acetylation. ostbl1 and ostbl2 single mutant and the tbl1 tbl2 double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall acetylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan monoacetylation. The divergent expression levels of OsTBL1 and OsTBL2 explained the chemotype difference and indicated that OsTBL1 is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates acetyl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can transfer up to four acetyl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 transfers acetate to both 2-O and 3-O sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, ostbl1 and tbl1 tbl2 displayed susceptibility to rice blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance. This study identifies the major genes responsible for xylan acetylation in rice plants.
27829023	CONSTANS-Like 9 (OsCOL9) Interacts with Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1(OsRACK1) to Regulate Blast Resistance through Salicylic Acid and Ethylene Signaling Pathways.	2016	PLoS One	In a previous transcriptome analysis of early response genes in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection, we identified a CONSTANS-like (COL) gene OsCOL9. In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of OsCOL9 in blast resistance. OsCOL9 belonged to group II of the COL protein family, and it contained a BB-box and a C-terminal CCT (CONSTANS, COL and TOC1) domain. OsCOL9 was found in the nucleus of rice cells, and it exerted transcriptional activation activities through its middle region (MR). Magnaporthe oryzae infection induced OsCOL9 expression, and transgenic OsCOL9 knock-out rice plants showed increased pathogen susceptibility. OsCOL9 was a critical regulator of pathogen-related genes, especially PR1b, which were also activated by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylicacid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene (ET). Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis. Interestingly, we found that OsCOL9 physically interacted with the scaffold protein OsRACK1 through its CCT domain, and the OsRACK1 expression was induced in response to exogenous SA and ACC as well as M. oryzae infection. Taken together, these results indicated that the COL protein OsCOL9 interacted with OsRACK1, and it enhanced the rice blast resistance through SA and ET signaling pathways.
27871243	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Sporopollenin is a major component of the pollen exine pattern. In Arabidopsis, acyl-CoA synthetase5 (ACOS5) is involved in sporopollenin precursor biosynthesis. In this study, we identified its orthologue, OsACOS12, in rice (Oryza sativa) and compared the functional conservation of ACOS in rice to Arabidopsis.

RESULTS: Sequence analysis showed that OsACOS12 shares 63.9 % amino acid sequence identity with ACOS5. The osacos12 mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in LOC_Os04g24530 exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice. In situ hybridization shows that OsACOS12 is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level. The localization of OsACOS12-GFP demonstrated that OsACOS12 protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules. OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis.

CONCLUSIONS: OsACOS12 is an orthologue of ACOS5 that is essential for sporopollenin synthesis in rice. ACOS5 and OsACOS12 are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species.
27715009	Crystal Structure of Os79 (Os04g0206600) from Oryza sativa: A UDP-glucosyltransferase Involved in the Detoxification of Deoxynivalenol.	2016	Biochemistry	Fusarium head blight is a plant disease with significant agricultural and health impact which affects cereal crops such as wheat, barley, and maize and is characterized by reduced grain yield and the accumulation of trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Studies have identified trichothecene production as a virulence factor in Fusarium graminearum and have linked DON resistance to the ability to form DON-3-O-glucoside in wheat. Here, the structures of a deoxynivalenol:UDP-glucosyltransferase (Os79) from Oryza sativa are reported in complex with UDP in an open conformation, in complex with UDP in a closed conformation, and in complex with UDP-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose and trichothecene at 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. The active site of Os79 lies in a groove between the N-terminal acceptor and the C-terminal donor-binding domains. Structural alignments reveal that Os79 likely utilizes a catalytic mechanism similar to those of other plant UGTs, with His 27 activating the trichothecene O3 hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack at C1' of the UDP-glucose donor. Kinetic analysis of mutant Os79 revealed that Thr 291 plays a critical role in catalysis as a catalytic acid or to position the UDP moiety during the nucleophilic attack. Steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrated that Os79 conjugates multiple trichothecene substrates such as DON, nivalenol, isotrichodermol, and HT-2 toxin, but not T-2 toxin. These data establish a foundation for understanding substrate specificity and activity in this enzyme and can be used to guide future efforts to increase DON resistance in cereal crops.
27794118	Increasing resistant starch content in rice for better consumer health.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	
27791169	Allelic diversity in an NLR gene BPH9 enables rice to combat planthopper variation.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, is one of the most devastating insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Currently, 30 BPH-resistance genes have been genetically defined, most of which are clustered on specific chromosome regions. Here, we describe molecular cloning and characterization of a BPH-resistance gene, BPH9, mapped on the long arm of rice chromosome 12 (12L). BPH9 encodes a rare type of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing protein that localizes to the endomembrane system and causes a cell death phenotype. BPH9 activates salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-signaling pathways in rice plants and confers both antixenosis and antibiosis to BPH. We further demonstrated that the eight BPH-resistance genes that are clustered on chromosome 12L, including the widely used BPH1, are allelic with each other. To honor the priority in the literature, we thus designated this locus as BPH1/9 These eight genes can be classified into four allelotypes, BPH1/9-1, -2, -7, and -9 These allelotypes confer varying levels of resistance to different biotypes of BPH. The coding region of BPH1/9 shows a high level of diversity in rice germplasm. Homologous fragments of the nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains exist, which might have served as a repository for generating allele diversity. Our findings reveal a rice plant strategy for modifying the genetic information to gain the upper hand in the struggle against insect herbivores. Further exploration of natural allelic variation and artificial shuffling within this gene may allow breeding to be tailored to control emerging biotypes of BPH.
27661977	Role of Reversible Histidine Coordination in Hydroxylamine Reduction by Plant Hemoglobins (Phytoglobins).	2016	Biochemistry	Reduction of hydroxylamine to ammonium by phytoglobin, a plant hexacoordinate hemoglobin, is much faster than that of other hexacoordinate hemoglobins or pentacoordinate hemoglobins such as myoglobin, leghemoglobin, and red blood cell hemoglobin. The reason for differences in reactivity is not known but could be intermolecular electron transfer between protein molecules in support of the required two-electron reduction, hydroxylamine binding, or active site architecture favoring the reaction. Experiments were conducted with phytoglobins from rice, tomato, and soybean along with human neuroglobin and soybean leghemoglobin that reveal hydroxylamine binding as the rate-limiting step. For hexacoordinate hemoglobins, binding is limited by the dissociation rate constant for the distal histidine, while leghemoglobin is limited by an intrinsically low affinity for hydroxylamine. When the distal histidine is removed from rice phytoglobin, a hydroxylamine-bound intermediate is formed and the reaction rate is diminished, indicating that the distal histidine imidazole side chain is critical for the reaction, albeit not for electron transfer but rather for direct interaction with the substrate. Together, these results demonstrate that phytoglobins are superior at hydroxylamine reduction because they have distal histidine coordination affinity constants near 1, and facile rate constants for binding and dissociation of the histidine side chain. Hexacoordinate hemoglobins such as neuroglobin are limited by tighter histidine coordination that blocks hydroxylamine binding, and pentacoordinate hemoglobins have intrinsically lower hydroxylamine affinities.
27742800	Global Analysis of Truncated RNA Ends Reveals New Insights into Ribosome Stalling in Plants.	2016	Plant Cell	High-throughput approaches for profiling the 5' ends of RNA degradation intermediates on a genome-wide scale are frequently applied to analyze and validate cleavage sites guided by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the complexity of the RNA degradome other than miRNA targets is currently largely uncharacterized, and this limits the application of RNA degradome studies. We conducted a global analysis of 5'-truncated mRNA ends that mapped to coding sequences (CDSs) of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and soybean (Glycine max). Based on this analysis, we provide multiple lines of evidence to show that the plant RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. We observed a 3-nucleotide periodicity in the position of free 5' RNA ends and a bias toward the translational frame. By examining conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of Arabidopsis and rice, we found a predominance of 5' termini of RNA degradation intermediates that were separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment. Through the analysis of RNA degradome data, we discovered uORFs and CDS regions potentially associated with stacked ribosomes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, our analysis of RNA degradome data suggested that the binding of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE7 to a noncleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work demonstrates an alternative use of RNA degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling.
27791174	Critical roles of soluble starch synthase SSIIIa and granule-bound starch synthase Waxy in synthesizing resistant starch in rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Changes in human lifestyle and food consumption have resulted in a large increase in the incidence of type-2 diabetes, obesity, and colon disease, especially in Asia. These conditions are a growing threat to human health, but consumption of foods high in resistant starch (RS) can potentially reduce their incidence. Strategies to increase RS in rice are limited by a lack of knowledge of its molecular basis. Through map-based cloning of a RS locus in indica rice, we have identified a defective soluble starch synthase gene (SSIIIa) responsible for RS production and further showed that RS production is dependent on the high expression of the Waxya (Wxa) allele, which is prevalent in indica varieties. The resulting RS has modified granule structure; high amylose, lipid, and amylose-lipid complex; and altered physicochemical properties. This discovery provides an opportunity to increase RS content of cooked rice, especially in the indica varieties, which predominates in southern Asia.
27833629	Development of Marker-Free Insect-Resistant Indica Rice by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-Mediated Co-transformation.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation is an efficient strategy to generate marker-free transgenic plants. In this study, the vectors pMF-2A∗ containing a synthetic cry2A∗ gene driven by maize ubiquitin promoter and pCAMBIA1301 harboring hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) were introduced into Minghui86 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica), an elite indica restorer line. Two independent transformants containing both the cry2A∗ gene and hpt gene were regenerated. Several homozygous marker-free transgenic progenies were derived from family 2AH2, and three of them were selected for further insect bioassay in the laboratory and field. Insect-resistance assays revealed that all the three transgenic lines were highly resistant to striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis), yellow stem borer (Tryporyza incertulas) and rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). The measurement of Cry2A protein concentration showed that Cry2A protein was stably expressed in leaves and stems of homozygous transgenic lines and their hybrids. The yields of the marker-free homozygous transgenic lines and their hybrids were not significantly different from those of their corresponding controls. Furthermore, the results of flanking sequence isolation showed that the T-DNA in line 8-30 was integrated into the intergenic region of chromosome 2 (between Os02g43680 and Os02g43690). These results indicate that the marker-free transgenic rice has the potential for commercial production.
27718311	A rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, OsJRL, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	2017	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Salinity, which is one of the most common abiotic stresses, may severely affect plant productivity and quality. Although plant lectins are thought to play important roles in plant defense signaling during pathogen attack, little is known about the contribution of plant lectins to stress resistance. We cloned and functionally characterized a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, OsJRL, from rice 'Nipponbare'. We analyzed the expression patterns of OsJRL under various stress conditions in rice. Furthermore, we overexpressed OsJRL in Escherichia coli and rice. The cDNA of OsJRL contained a 438 bp open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 145 amino acids. OsJRL was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Real time PCR analyses revealed that OsJRL expression showed tissue specificity in rice and was upregulated under diverse stresses, namely salt, drought, cold, heat and abscisic acid treatments. Overexpression of OsJRL in E. coli enhanced cell viability and dramatically improved tolerance of high salinity. Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na+ transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B). Based on these results, we suggest that OsJRL plays an important role in cell protection and stress signal transduction.
27797431	A nuclear-localized rice glyoxalase I enzyme, OsGLYI-8, functions in the detoxification of methylglyoxal in the nucleus.	2017	Plant J	The cellular levels of methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic byproduct of glycolysis, rise under various abiotic stresses in plants. Detoxification of MG is primarily through the glyoxalase pathway. The first enzyme of the pathway, glyoxalase I (GLYI), is a cytosolic metalloenzyme requiring either Ni2+ or Zn2+ for its activity. Plants possess multiple GLYI genes, of which only some have been partially characterized; hence, the precise molecular mechanism, subcellular localization and physiological relevance of these diverse isoforms remain enigmatic. Here, we report the biochemical properties and physiological role of a putative chloroplast-localized GLYI enzyme, OsGLYI-8, from rice, which is strikingly different from all hitherto studied GLYI enzymes in terms of its intracellular localization, metal dependency and kinetics. In contrast to its predicted localization, OsGLYI-8 was found to localize in the nucleus along with its substrate, MG. Further, OsGLYI-8 does not show a strict requirement for metal ions for its activity, is functional as a dimer and exhibits unusual biphasic steady-state kinetics with a low-affinity and a high-affinity substrate-binding component. Loss of AtGLYI-2, the closest Arabidopsis ortholog of OsGLYI-8, results in severe germination defects in the presence of MG and growth retardation under salinity stress conditions. These defects were rescued upon complementation with AtGLYI-2 or OsGLYI-8. Our findings thus provide evidence for the presence of a GLYI enzyme and MG detoxification in the nucleus.
27702843	OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation.	2016	Plant Physiol	Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in rice. OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are able to complement an Escherichia coli mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. OsHAC1:1 and OsHAC1;2 are predominantly expressed in roots, with OsHAC1;1 being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while OsHAC1;2 is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out OsHAC1;1 or OsHAC1;2 decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As accumulation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either OsHAC1;1 or OsHAC1;2 increased arsenite efflux, reduced As accumulation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either OsHAC1;1 or OsHAC1;2 also decreased As accumulation in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As accumulation in rice shoots and grain.
27835768	Rice CYO1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledon chloroplast biogenesis factor AtCYO1, is expressed in leaves and involved in photosynthetic performance.	2016	J Plant Physiol	In the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the cotyledon chloroplast biogenesis factor AtCYO1 is crucial for the biogenesis of cotyledon chloroplasts. Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtCYO1 have pale cotyledons but develop normal mature leaves. In the monocotyledonous plant Oryza sativa, the gene OsCYO1 has high sequence identity to AtCYO1, but its function is unknown. We examined the role of OsCYO1 in O. sativa. We first confirmed that transformation with OsCYO1 could recover the phenotype of the Arabidopsis cyo1 mutant. Similar to AtCYO1, recombinant OsCYO1 has protein disulfide reductase (PDR) activity, which increased as a function of dieosin glutathione disulfide concentration with an apparent Km of 3.2μM and Kcat of 0.53min-1. The PDR activity was reduced when NADPH or NADH was used as an electron donor; however, PDR activity was observed with OsCYO1 and glutathione, suggesting that glutathione may serve as a reducing agent for OsCYO1 in vivo. In O. sativa, the OsCYO1 transcript level was higher in leaves compared with the coleoptile, which is the first leaf-like organ that forms during rice embryogenesis. Many OsCYO1 mutant lines defective in RNA interference had green leaves, however, three mutant lines had not only albino coleoptile but also albino leaves. Those having green leaves reduced photosynthetic performance in leaves. Our results demonstrate that OsCYO1 is enzymatically equivalent to AtCYO1 but that the physiological role of OsCYO1 in monocotyledonous plants may differ from that of AtCYO1 in dicotyledonous plants.
27742884	High Silicon Accumulation in the Shoot is Required for Down-Regulating the Expression of Si Transporter Genes in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice requires high silicon (Si) for its high and sustainable yield. The efficient uptake of Si in rice is mediated by two transporters OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, which function as influx and efflux transporters, respectively. Our previous studies showed that the mRNA expression levels of these transporter genes were down-regulated by Si. Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression. There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions. A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si. Analysis with transgenic rice carrying different lengths of OsLsi1 promoter regions fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene revealed that the region responsible for the Si response of OsLsi1 expression is present between -327 to -292 in the promoter. However, this region was not associated with the tissue and cellular localization of OsLsi1. In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and the region between -327 and -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice.
27701783	Activation of ethylene signaling pathways enhances disease resistance by regulating ROS and phytoalexin production in rice.	2017	Plant J	Ethylene plays diverse roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the roles of ethylene signaling in immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Resistant rice cultivars accumulated higher levels of ethylene than susceptible ones. Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance. Mutation of OsEIN2 led to enhanced disease susceptibility. Whole-genome transcription analysis revealed that responsive genes of ethylene, jasmonates (JAs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling as well as phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were remarkably induced. Transcription of OsrbohA/B, which encode NADPH oxidases, and OsOPRs, the JA biosynthesis genes, were induced by M. oryzae infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsEIL1 binds to the promoters of OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR4 to activate their expression. These data suggest that OsEIN2-mediated OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR transcription may play essential roles in ROS generation, JA biosynthesis and the subsequent phytoalexin accumulation. Therefore, the involvement of ethylene signaling in disease resistance is probably by activation of ROS and phytoalexin production in rice during M. oryzae infection.
27714489	Novel interaction between CCR4 and CAF1 in rice CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: Rice is an important crop in the world. However, little is known about rice mRNA deadenylation, which is an important regulation step of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The CCR4-NOT1 complex contains two key components, CCR4 and CAF1, which are the main cytoplasmic deadenylases in eukaryotic cells. In yeast and humans, CCR4 can interact with CAF1 via its N-terminal LRR domain. However, no CCR4 protein containing N-terminal LRR motifs have been found in plants. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a novel pattern of interaction between OsCCR4 and OsCAF1 in the rice CCR4-NOT complex, and that OsCAF1 acts as a bridge between OsCCR4 and OsNOT1 in this complex. Our results revealed that the Mynd-like domain at the N-terminus of rice CCR4 proteins and the PXLXP motif at the rice CAF1 N-terminus play critical roles in OsCCR4-OsCAF1 interaction. Deadenylation, also called poly(A) tail shortening, is the first rate-limiting step in general cytoplasmic mRNA degradation in eukaryotic cells. Carbon catabolite repressor (CCR)4 and CCR4-associated factor (CAF)1 in the CCR4-NOT complex function in mRNA poly(A) tail shortening. CCR4s contain N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs that interact with CAF1s in yeast, fruit fly and mammals. In silico analysis has not identified any plant CCR4 proteins that contain LRR motifs. Here, two rice CCR4 homologous genes, OsCCR4a and OsCCR4b, were identified. The isolated recombinant exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase domain of OsCCR4a and OsCCR4b exhibited 3'-5' exonuclease activity in vitro, and point mutation of a catalytic residue in this domain disrupted the deadenylase activity. Both OsCCR4a and OsCCR4b fluorescent fusion proteins were localized in the rice cytoplasm and nucleus, and both associated with processing bodies via their N-terminus. Binding analyses showed that OsCCR4a and OsCCR4b directly interacted with three rice CAF1 family members: OsCAF1A, OsCAF1G and OsCAF1H. The zf-MYND-like domain at the N terminus of rice CCR4 and the PXLXP motif of rice CAF1 play critical roles in OsCCR4-OsCAF1 interaction. OsCAF1 proteins, but not OsCCR4 proteins, can interact with the MIG4G domain of rice OsNOT1. Our studies thus reveal a hitherto undiscovered novel interaction pattern that connects OsCCR4 and OsCAF1 in the rice CCR4-NOT complex.
27766460	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: This manuscript reports the identification and characterization of five transcription factors binding to the promoter of OsNHX1 in a salt stress tolerant rice genotype (Hasawi). Although NHX1 encoding genes are known to be highly regulated at the transcription level by different abiotic stresses, namely salt and drought stress, until now only one transcription factor (TF) binding to its promoter has been reported. In order to unveil the TFs regulating NHX1 gene expression, which is known to be highly induced under salt stress, we have used a Y1H system to screen a salt induced rice cDNA expression library from Hasawi. This approach allowed us to identify five TFs belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) binding to the OsNHX1 gene promoter. We have also shown that these TFs act either as transcriptional activators (OsPCF2, OsNIN-like4) or repressors (OsCPP5, OsNIN-like2) and their encoding genes are differentially regulated by salt and PEG-induced drought stress in two rice genotypes, Nipponbare (salt-sensitive) and Hasawi (salt-tolerant). The transactivation activity of OsNIN-like3 was not possible to determine. Increased soil salinity has a direct impact on the reduction of plant growth and crop yield and it is therefore fundamental to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation under adverse environmental conditions. OsNHX1 is the most abundant K+-Na+/H+ antiporter localized in the tonoplast and its gene expression is induced by salt, drought and ABA. To investigate how OsNHX1 is transcriptionally regulated in response to salt stress in a salt-tolerant rice genotype (Hasawi), a salt-stress-induced cDNA expression library was constructed and subsequently screened using the yeast one-hybrid system and the OsNHX1 promoter as bait. Five transcription factors (TFs) belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) were identified as binding to OsNHX1 promoter. Transactivation activity assays performed in Arabidopsis and rice protoplasts showed that OsPCF2 and OsNIN-like4 are activators of the OsNHX1 gene expression, while OsCPP5 and OsNIN-like2 act as repressors. The transactivation activity of OsNIN-like3 needs to be further investigated. Gene expression studies showed that OsNHX1 transcript level is highly induced by salt and PEG-induced drought stress in both shoots and roots in both Nipponbare and Hasawi rice genotypes. Nevertheless, OsNHX1 seems to play a particular role in shoots in response to drought. Most of the TFs binding to OsNHX1 promoter showed a modest transcriptional regulation under stress conditions, however, in response to most of the conditions studied, the OsPCF2 was induced earlier than OsNHX1, indicating that OsPCF2 may activate OsNHX1 gene expression. In addition, although the OsNHX1 response to salt and PEG-induced drought stress in either shoots or roots was quite similar in both rice genotypes, the expression of OsPCF2 in roots under salt stress and the OsNIN-like4 in roots subjected to PEG was mainly up-regulated in Hasawi, indicating that these TFs may be associated with the salt and drought stress tolerance observed for this genotype.
27757415	Monolignol ferulate conjugates are naturally incorporated into plant lignins.	2016	Sci Adv	Angiosperms represent most of the terrestrial plants and are the primary research focus for the conversion of biomass to liquid fuels and coproducts. Lignin limits our access to fibers and represents a large fraction of the chemical energy stored in plant cell walls. Recently, the incorporation of monolignol ferulates into lignin polymers was accomplished via the engineering of an exotic transferase into commercially relevant poplar. We report that various angiosperm species might have convergently evolved to natively produce lignins that incorporate monolignol ferulate conjugates. We show that this activity may be accomplished by a BAHD feruloyl-coenzyme A monolignol transferase, OsFMT1 (AT5), in rice and its orthologs in other monocots.
27730518	Molecular and Bioinformatic Characterization of the Rice ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE Gene Family.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE (RUS) genes exist in most eukaryotic organisms, and encode proteins that contain a DUF647 (domain of unknown function 647). Although the RUS genes are known to play essential roles in Arabidopsis seedling development, their precise functions are not well understood in other plants, including rice.

FINDINGS: In this study, six OsRUS genes were cloned from rice root and leaf cDNA libraries. Our analysis showed that the sequence and open reading frame of cloned OsRUS3 cDNA differs from the predictions reported in the RAP-DB and RGAP databases. Public microarray, MPSS, and EST databases were used to analyze the expression profiles of the six OsRUS genes. Expression profiles for all OsRUS genes at different rice developmental stages were also analyzed by qRT-PCR. The signal peptide, GPI-anchor, transmembrane domain and subcellular localization of OsRUS proteins were predicted by various bioinformatics tools. Furthermore OsRUS1 was determined to be localized to the chloroplast by a protoplast experiment.

CONCLUSIONS: All the characterization of the OsRUS family generated from this study will provide a crucial foundation from which to further dissect how OsRUS genes function in rice development.
27744299	Retrotransposon-Mediated Aluminum Tolerance through Enhanced Expression of the Citrate Transporter OsFRDL4.	2016	Plant Physiol	High aluminum (Al) tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa) is controlled by multiple tolerance genes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential expression of these genes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the factors regulating the expression of OsFRDL4, a gene encoding a citrate efflux transporter involved in Al-induced citrate secretion from the roots. Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines derived from cv Nipponbare (high OsFRDL4 expression) and cv Kasalath (low OsFRDL4 expression) revealed that the differential expression of OsFRDL4 is responsible for the quantitative trait locus for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1. Comparison of the OsFRDL4 gene structure in cv Nipponbare and cv Kasalath showed that there was no difference in the position of the transcriptional start site, but a 1.2-kb insertion showing high similarity to the solo long terminal repeat of the retrotransposon was found in the promoter region of OsFRDL4 in cv Nipponbare. This insertion showed higher promoter activity and contained nine cis-acting elements for ALUMINUM RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (ART1). However, this insertion did not alter the spatial expression or cellular localization of OsFRDL4. Furthermore, this insertion was found in most japonica varieties but was largely absent from indica varieties or wild rice species. These results indicate that the 1.2-kb insertion in the OsFRDL4 promoter region in japonica subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of OsFRDL4 due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1. Our results also suggest that this insertion event happened at the initial stage of domestication of japonica subspecies.
27826301	Knock-Down of a Tonoplast Localized Low-Affinity Nitrate Transporter <i>OsNPF7.2</i> Affects Rice Growth under High Nitrate Supply.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The large nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) has been shown to transport diverse substrates, including nitrate, amino acids, peptides, phytohormones, and glucosinolates. However, the rice (Oryza sativa) root-specific family member OsNPF7.2 has not been functionally characterized. Here, our data show that OsNPF7.2 is a tonoplast localized low-affinity nitrate transporter, that affects rice growth under high nitrate supply. Expression analysis showed that OsNPF7.2 was mainly expressed in the elongation and maturation zones of roots, especially in the root sclerenchyma, cortex and stele. It was also induced by high concentrations of nitrate. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsNPF7.2 was localized on the tonoplast of large and small vacuoles. Heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes suggested that OsNPF7.2 was a low-affinity nitrate transporter. Knock-down of OsNPF7.2 retarded rice growth under high concentrations of nitrate. Therefore, we deduce that OsNPF7.2 plays a role in intracellular allocation of nitrate in roots, and thus influences rice growth under high nitrate supply.
27694845	Methyl-CpG binding domain protein acts to regulate the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers on rice DNA.	2016	Sci Rep	UVB radiation causes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) to form on the DNA of living organisms. This study found that overexpression of the silicon absorbance gene Lsi1 reduced the accumulation of CPDs in rice, which profited from the reactivation by photolyase. The transcript abundance of deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase (Os10g0167600) was generally correlated with the silicon content of the rice, and the up-regulation of Os10g0167600 was found to be highest in the UVB-treated Lsi1-overexpressed (Lsi1-OX) rice. A trans-acting factor, methyl-CpG binding domain protein (OsMeCP), was found to interact with the cis-element of Os10g0167600. The nucleic location of OsMeCP effectively enabled the transcriptional regulation. Compared with the WT, the level of OsMeCP was lower in the Lsi1-OX rice but higher in the Lsi1-RNAi line. Rice cultured in a high silicate-concentration solution also exhibited less OsMeCP abundance. Overexpression of OsMeCP led to lower Os10g0167600 transcript levels and a higher CPD content than in the WT, but the reverse was true in the OsMeCP-RNAi line. These findings indicate that OsMeCP acts as a negative regulator of silicon, and can mediate the repression of the transcription from Os10g0167600, which inhibits the photoreactivation of the photolyase involved in the repair of CPDs.
27718117	Overexpression of OsDT11, which encodes a novel cysteine-rich peptide, enhances drought tolerance and increases ABA concentration in rice.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Short-chain peptides play important roles in plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Here, we characterized a gene of unknown function termed OsDT11, which encodes an 88 amino acid short-chain peptide and belongs to the cysteine-rich peptide family. It was found that the expression of OsDT11 can be activated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Compared with wild-type lines, the OsDT11-overexpression lines displayed dramatically enhanced tolerance to drought and had reduced water loss, reduced stomatal density, and an increased the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA). The suppression of OsDT11 expression resulted in an increased sensitivity to drought compared to wild-type expression. Several drought-related genes, including genes encoding abscisic acid (ABA) signaling markers, were also strongly induced in the OsDT11-overexpressing lines. Moreover, the expression of OsDT11 was repressed in ABA-insensitive mutant Osbzip23 and Os2H16 RNAi lines. These results suggest that OsDT11-mediated drought tolerance may be dependent on the ABA signaling pathway.
27702997	Dynamic changes of small RNAs in rice spikelet development reveal specialized reproductive phasiRNA pathways.	2016	J Exp Bot	Dissection of the genetic pathways and mechanisms by which anther development occurs in grasses is crucial for both a basic understanding of plant development and for examining traits of agronomic importance such as male sterility. In rice, MULTIPLE SPOROCYTES1 (MSP1), a leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase, plays an important role in anther development by limiting the number of sporocytes. OsTDL1a (a TPD1-like gene in rice) encodes a small protein that acts as a cofactor of MSP1 in the same regulatory pathway. In this study, we analyzed small RNA and mRNA changes in different stages of spikelets from wild-type rice, and from msp1 and ostdl1a mutants. Analysis of the small RNA data identified miRNAs demonstrating differential abundances. miR2275 was depleted in the two rice mutants; this miRNA is specifically enriched in anthers and functions to trigger the production of 24-nt phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from PHAS loci. We observed that the 24-nt phasiRNAs as well as their precursor PHAS mRNAs were also depleted in the two mutants. An analysis of co-expression identified three Argonaute-encoding genes (OsAGO1d, OsAGO2b, and OsAGO18) that accumulate transcripts coordinately with phasiRNAs, suggesting a functional relationship. By mRNA in situ analysis, we demonstrated a strong correlation between the spatiotemporal pattern of these OsAGO transcripts and phasiRNA accumulations.
27708383	Evidence for nuclear interaction of a cytoskeleton protein (OsIFL) with metallothionein and its role in salinity stress tolerance.	2016	Sci Rep	Soil salinity is being perceived as a major threat to agriculture. Plant breeders and molecular biologist are putting their best efforts to raise salt-tolerant crops. The discovery of the Saltol QTL, a major QTL localized on chromosome I, responsible for salt tolerance at seedling stage in rice has given new hopes for raising salinity tolerant rice genotypes. In the present study, we have functionally characterized a Saltol QTL localized cytoskeletal protein, intermediate filament like protein (OsIFL), of rice. Studies related to intermediate filaments are emerging in plants, especially with respect to their involvement in abiotic stress response. Our investigations clearly establish that the heterologous expression of OsIFL in three diverse organisms (bacteria, yeast and tobacco) provides survival advantage towards diverse abiotic stresses. Screening of rice cDNA library revealed OsIFL to be strongly interacting with metallothionein protein. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay further confirmed this interaction to be occurring inside the nucleus. Overexpression of OsIFL in transgenic tobacco plants conferred salinity stress tolerance by maintaining favourable K+/Na+ ratio and thus showed protection from salinity stress induced ion toxicity. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of a cytoskeletal protein in salinity stress tolerance in diverse organisms.
27716044	Identification and expression analysis of OsLPR family revealed the potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is often limiting in soils and affects plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, Low Phosphate Root1 (LPR1) and its close paralog LPR2 encode multicopper oxidases (MCOs). They regulate meristem responses of root system to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. However, the roles of LPR gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) in maintaining Pi homeostasis have not been elucidated as yet.

RESULTS: Here, the identification and expression analysis for the homologs of LPR1/2 in rice were carried out. Five homologs, hereafter referred to as OsLPR1-5, were identified in rice, which are distributed on chromosome1 over a range of 65 kb. Phylogenetic analysis grouped OsLPR1/3/4/5 and OsLPR2 into two distinct sub-clades with OsLPR3 and 5 showing close proximity. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed higher expression levels of OsLPR3-5 and OsLPR2 in root and shoot, respectively. Deficiencies of different nutrients ie, P, nitrogen (N), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) exerted differential and partially overlapping effects on the relative expression levels of the members of OsLPR family. Pi deficiency (-P) triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5. Strong induction in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5 in osphr2 suggested their negative transcriptional regulation by OsPHR2. Further, the expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5 were either attenuated in ossiz1 and ospho2 or augmented in rice overexpressing OsSPX1.

CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of OsLPR family with potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice.
27833617	An Efficient Strategy Combining SSR Markers- and Advanced QTL-seq-driven QTL Mapping Unravels Candidate Genes Regulating Grain Weight in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Development and use of genome-wide informative simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and novel integrated genomic strategies are vital to drive genomics-assisted breeding applications and for efficient dissection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying complex traits in rice. The present study developed 6244 genome-wide informative SSR markers exhibiting in silico fragment length polymorphism based on repeat-unit variations among genomic sequences of 11 indica, japonica, aus, and wild rice accessions. These markers were mapped on diverse coding and non-coding sequence components of known cloned/candidate genes annotated from 12 chromosomes and revealed a much higher amplification (97%) and polymorphic potential (88%) along with wider genetic/functional diversity level (16-74% with a mean 53%) especially among accessions belonging to indica cultivar group, suggesting their utility in large-scale genomics-assisted breeding applications in rice. A high-density 3791 SSR markers-anchored genetic linkage map (IR 64 × Sonasal) spanning 2060 cM total map-length with an average inter-marker distance of 0.54 cM was generated. This reference genetic map identified six major genomic regions harboring robust QTLs (31% combined phenotypic variation explained with a 5.7-8.7 LOD) governing grain weight on six rice chromosomes. One strong grain weight major QTL region (OsqGW5.1) was narrowed-down by integrating traditional QTL mapping with high-resolution QTL region-specific integrated SSR and single nucleotide polymorphism markers-based QTL-seq analysis and differential expression profiling. This led us to delineate two natural allelic variants in two known cis-regulatory elements (RAV1AAT and CARGCW8GAT) of glycosyl hydrolase and serine carboxypeptidase genes exhibiting pronounced seed-specific differential regulation in low (Sonasal) and high (IR 64) grain weight mapping parental accessions. Our genome-wide SSR marker resource (polymorphic within/between diverse cultivar groups) and integrated genomic strategy can efficiently scan functionally relevant potential molecular tags (markers, candidate genes and alleles) regulating complex agronomic traits (grain weight) and expedite marker-assisted genetic enhancement in rice.
27771249	Chromosome mapping, molecular cloning and expression analysis of a novel gene response for leaf width in rice.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Genetic analysis revealed that narrow leaf, small panicle, thin and slender stems as well as low fertility rate of an Indica rice variety were recessive traits and controlled by a single gene. Applying map-based cloning strategy, a novel narrow leaf gene, which was named nal11 was delimited to an interval of 58.3 kb between the InDel markers N10 and InD5016. There are 9 genes in the mapping interval, and only a heat shock DNAJ protein encode gene (Os07g09450) has a specific G to T SNP, which was occurred at the last base of the second exon of Os07g09450 in ZYX. 5' and 3' RACE result shown that there were two transcripts in NAL11, and the SNP in nal11 leads to a variable shear of mRNA. In addition, this type of mRNA alternative splicing together with a stop codon closely followed the SNP which caused termination of translation destroyed the DNAJ domain of nal11's product. These results suggested that the heat shock DNAJ gene was most likely to be the candidate gene of nal11. The results of RT-PCR and real-time PCR further verified that the SNP in the ZYX-nal11 gene affects mRNA splicing pattern. Phenotype of ZYX may be caused by a statistically significant reduction in the total number of small veins in leaf, size and number of small vascular bundles and cells in stems, similar to several previous reported mutations. The basic molecular information we provide here will be useful for further investigations of the physiological function of the heat shock DNAJ gene, which will be helpful in better understanding the role of the DNAJ family in regulation of plant type traits such as leaf width of rice.
27601671	P31comet, a member of the synaptonemal complex, participates in meiotic DSB formation in rice.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The human mitotic arrest-deficient 2 (Mad2) binding protein p31(comet) participates in the spindle checkpoint and coordinates cell cycle events in mitosis although its function in meiosis remains unknown in all organisms. Here, we reveal P31(comet) as a synaptonemal complex (SC) protein in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In p31(comet), homologous pairing and synapsis are eliminated, leading to the homologous nondisjunction and complete sterility. The failure in loading of histone H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) in p31(comet), together with the suppressed chromosome fragmentation in rice completion of meiotic recombination 1 (com1) p31(comet) and radiation sensitive 51c (rad51c) p31(comet) double mutants, indicates that P31(comet) plays an essential role in double-strand break (DSB) formation. Interestingly, the dynamic colocalization pattern between P31(comet) and ZEP1 (a transverse filament protein of SC) by immunostaining, as well as the interaction between P31(comet) and CENTRAL REGION COMPONENT 1 (CRC1) in yeast two-hybrid assays, suggests possible involvement of P31(comet) in SC installation. Together, these data indicate that P31(comet) plays a key role in DSB formation and SC installation, mainly through its cooperation with CRC1.
27602511	Genomic architecture of heterosis for yield traits in rice.	2016	Nature	Increasing grain yield is a long-term goal in crop breeding to meet the demand for global food security. Heterosis, when a hybrid shows higher performance for a trait than both parents, offers an important strategy for crop breeding. To examine the genetic basis of heterosis for yield in rice, here we generate, sequence and record the phenotypes of 10,074 F2 lines from 17 representative hybrid rice crosses. We classify modern hybrid rice varieties into three groups, representing different hybrid breeding systems. Although we do not find any heterosis-associated loci shared across all lines, within each group, a small number of genomic loci from female parents explain a large proportion of the yield advantage of hybrids over their male parents. For some of these loci, we find support for partial dominance of heterozygous locus for yield-related traits and better-parent heterosis for overall performance when all of the grain-yield traits are considered together. These results inform on the genomic architecture of heterosis and rice hybrid breeding.
27634315	GAD1 Encodes a Secreted Peptide That Regulates Grain Number, Grain Length, and Awn Development in Rice Domestication.	2016	Plant Cell	Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which typically displays fewer grains per panicle and longer grains than cultivated rice. In addition, wild rice has long awns, whereas cultivated rice has short awns or lacks them altogether. These changes represent critical events in rice domestication. Here, we identified a major gene, GRAIN NUMBER, GRAIN LENGTH AND AWN DEVELOPMENT1 (GAD1), that regulates those critical changes during rice domestication. GAD1 is located on chromosome 8 and is predicted to encode a small secretary signal peptide belonging to the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE family. A frame-shift insertion in gad1 destroyed the conserved cysteine residues of the peptide, resulting in a loss of function, and causing the increased number of grains per panicle, shorter grains, and awnless phenotype characteristic of cultivated rice. Our findings provide a useful paradigm for revealing functions of peptide signal molecules in plant development and helps elucidate the molecular basis of rice domestication.
27655841	Field of Genes: Uncovering EGRINs (Environmental Gene Regulatory Influence Networks) in Rice That Function during High-Temperature and Drought Stress.	2016	Plant Cell	
27663737	Integrated analysis of phenome, genome, and transcriptome of hybrid rice uncovered multiple heterosis-related loci for yield increase.	2016	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hybrid rice is the dominant form of rice planted in China, and its use has extended worldwide since the 1970s. It offers great yield advantages and has contributed greatly to the world's food security. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis have remained a mystery. In this study we integrated genetics and omics analyses to determine the candidate genes for yield heterosis in a model two-line rice hybrid system, Liang-you-pei 9 (LYP9) and its parents. Phenomics study revealed that the better parent heterosis (BPH) of yield in hybrid is not ascribed to BPH of all the yield components but is specific to the BPH of spikelet number per panicle (SPP) and paternal parent heterosis (PPH) of effective panicle number (EPN). Genetic analyses then identified multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these two components. Moreover, a number of differentially expressed genes and alleles in the hybrid were mapped by transcriptome profiling to the QTL regions as possible candidate genes. In parallel, a major QTL for yield heterosis, rice heterosis 8 (RH8), was found to be the DTH8/Ghd8/LHD1 gene. Based on the shared allelic heterozygosity of RH8 in many hybrid rice cultivars, a common mechanism for yield heterosis in the present commercial hybrid rice is proposed.
27655842	EGRINs (Environmental Gene Regulatory Influence Networks) in Rice That Function in the Response to Water Deficit, High Temperature, and Agricultural Environments.	2016	Plant Cell	Environmental gene regulatory influence networks (EGRINs) coordinate the timing and rate of gene expression in response to environmental signals. EGRINs encompass many layers of regulation, which culminate in changes in accumulated transcript levels. Here, we inferred EGRINs for the response of five tropical Asian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars to high temperatures, water deficit, and agricultural field conditions by systematically integrating time-series transcriptome data, patterns of nucleosome-free chromatin, and the occurrence of known cis-regulatory elements. First, we identified 5447 putative target genes for 445 transcription factors (TFs) by connecting TFs with genes harboring known cis-regulatory motifs in nucleosome-free regions proximal to their transcriptional start sites. We then used network component analysis to estimate the regulatory activity for each TF based on the expression of its putative target genes. Finally, we inferred an EGRIN using the estimated transcription factor activity (TFA) as the regulator. The EGRINs include regulatory interactions between 4052 target genes regulated by 113 TFs. We resolved distinct regulatory roles for members of the heat shock factor family, including a putative regulatory connection between abiotic stress and the circadian clock. TFA estimation using network component analysis is an effective way of incorporating multiple genome-scale measurements into network inference.
27618555	The Multivesicular Bodies (MVBs)-Localized AAA ATPase LRD6-6 Inhibits Immunity and Cell Death Likely through Regulating MVBs-Mediated Vesicular Trafficking in Rice.	2016	PLoS Genet	Previous studies have shown that multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/endosomes-mediated vesicular trafficking may play key roles in plant immunity and cell death. However, the molecular regulation is poorly understood in rice. Here we report the identification and characterization of a MVBs-localized AAA ATPase LRD6-6 in rice. Disruption of LRD6-6 leads to enhanced immunity and cell death in rice. The ATPase activity and homo-dimerization of LRD6-6 is essential for its regulation on plant immunity and cell death. An ATPase inactive mutation (LRD6-6E315Q) leads to dominant-negative inhibition in plants. The LRD6-6 protein co-localizes with the MVBs marker protein RabF1/ARA6 and interacts with ESCRT-III components OsSNF7 and OsVPS2. Further analysis reveals that LRD6-6 is required for MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking and inhibits the biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds. Collectively, our study shows that the AAA ATPase LRD6-6 inhibits plant immunity and cell death most likely through modulating MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking in rice.
27624698	Overexpression of OsHox32 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Type Architecture and Leaf Development in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The Class III homeodomain Leu zipper (HD-Zip III) gene family plays important roles in plant growth and development. Here, we analyze the function of OsHox32, an HD-Zip III family member, and show that it exhibits pleiotropic effects on regulating plant type architecture and leaf development in rice.

RESULTS: Transgenic lines overexpressing OsHox32 (OsHox32-OV) produce narrow leaves that roll towards the adaxial side. Histological analysis revealed a decreased number of bulliform cells in OsHox32-OV lines. In addition, the angle between the leaf and culm was reduced, resulting in an erect plant phenotype. The height of the plants was reduced, resulting in a semi-dwarf phenotype. In addition, the chlorophyll level was reduced, resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate, but water use efficiency was significantly improved, presumably due to the rolled leaf phenotype. OsHox32 exhibited constitutive expression in different organs, with higher mRNA levels in the stem, leaf sheath, shoot apical meristems and young roots, suggesting a role in plant-type and leaf development. Moreover, OsHox32 mRNA levels were higher in light and lower in the dark under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that OsHox32 may be associated with light regulation. Photosynthesis-associated and chlorophyll biosynthesis-associated genes were down-regulated to result in the reduction of photosynthetic capacity in OsHox32-OV lines. mRNA level of six rice YABBY genes is up-regulated or down-regulated by OsHox32, suggesting that OsHox32 may regulate the architecture of plant type and leaf development by controlling the expression of YABBY genes in rice. In addition, OsHox32 mRNA level was induced by the phytohormones, indicating that OsHox32 may be involved in phytohormones regulatory pathways.

CONCLUSIONS: OsHox32, an HD-Zip III family member, plays pleiotropic effects on plant type architecture and leaf development in rice.
27620492	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Flowering or heading is one of most important agronomic traits in rice. It has been characterized that CONSTANS (CO) and CONSTANS-like (COL) proteins are critical flowering regulators in response to photoperiodic stress in plants. We have previously identified that the COL family member OsCOL9 can positively enhance the rice blast resistance. In the present study, we aimed to explore the functional role of OsCOL9 in modulating the photoperiodic flowering. Our data showed that overexpression of OsCOL9 delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level. OsCOL9 expression exhibited two types of circadian patterns under different daylight conditions, and it could delay the heading date by suppressing the Ehd1 photoperiodic flowering pathway. In contrast, the expressions of previously reported flowering regulators were not significantly changed in OsCOL9 transgenic plants, indicating that OsCOL9 functioned independently of other flowering pathways. In addition, OsCOL9 served as a potential yield gene, and its deficiency reduced the grain number of main panicle in plants. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that OsCOL9 physically interacted with Receptor for Activated C-kinase 1 (OsRACK1). Rhythmic pattern analysis suggested that OsRACK1 responded to the change of daylight, which was regulated by the circadian clock. Taken together, our results revealed that OsCOL9 could delay the flowering time in rice by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.
27733860	Association of Increased Grain Iron and Zinc Concentrations with Agro-morphological Traits of Biofortified Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Biofortification of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with micronutrients is widely recognized as a sustainable strategy to alleviate human iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies in developing countries where rice is the staple food. Constitutive overexpression of the rice nicotianamine synthase (OsNAS) genes has been successfully implemented to increase Fe and Zn concentrations in unpolished and polished rice grain. Intensive research is now needed to couple this high-micronutrient trait with high grain yields. We investigated associations of increased grain Fe and Zn concentrations with agro-morphological traits of backcross twice second filial (BC2F2) transgenic progeny carrying OsNAS1 or OsNAS2 overexpression constructs under indica/japonica and japonica/japonica genetic backgrounds. Thirteen agro-morphological traits were evaluated in BC2F2 transgenic progeny grown under hydroponic conditions. Concentrations of eight mineral nutrients (Fe, Zn, copper, manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus) in roots, stems/sheaths, non-flag leaves, flag leaves, panicles, and grain were also determined. A distance-based linear model (DistLM) was utilized to extract plant tissue nutrient predictors accounting for the largest variation in agro-morphological traits differing between transgenic and non-transgenic progeny. Overall, the BC2F2 transgenic progeny contained up to 148% higher Fe and 336% higher Zn concentrations in unpolished grain compared to non-transgenic progeny. However, unpolished grain concentrations surpassing 23 μg Fe g-1 and 40 μg Zn g-1 in BC2F2indica/japonica progeny, and 36 μg Fe g-1 and 56 μg Zn g1 in BC2F2japonica/japonica progeny, were associated with significant reductions in grain yield. DistLM analyses identified grain-Zn and panicle-magnesium as the primary nutrient predictors associated with grain yield reductions in the indica/japonica and japonica/japonica background, respectively. We subsequently produced polished grain from high-yield BC2F2 transgenic progeny carrying either the OsNAS1 or OsNAS2 overexpression constructs. The OsNAS2 overexpressing progeny had higher percentages of Fe and Zn in polished rice grain compared to the OsNAS1 overexpressing progeny. Results from this study demonstrate that genetic background has a major effect on the development of Fe and Zn biofortified rice. Moreover, our study shows that high-yielding rice lines with Fe and Zn biofortified polished grain can be developed by OsNAS2 overexpression and monitoring for Zn overaccumulation in the grain.
27588462	Plastidic phosphoglucomutase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase mutants impair starch synthesis in rice pollen grains and cause male sterility.	2016	J Exp Bot	To elucidate the starch synthesis pathway and the role of this reserve in rice pollen, we characterized mutations in the plastidic phosphoglucomutase, OspPGM, and the plastidic large subunit of ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc) pyrophosphorylase, OsAGPL4 Both genes were up-regulated in maturing pollen, a stage when starch begins to accumulate. Progeny analysis of self-pollinated heterozygous lines carrying the OspPGM mutant alleles, osppgm-1 and osppgm-2, or the OsAGPL4 mutant allele, osagpl4-1, as well as reciprocal crosses between the wild type (WT) and heterozygotes revealed that loss of OspPGM or OsAGPL4 caused male sterility, with the former condition rescued by the introduction of the WT OspPGM gene. While iodine staining and transmission electron microscopy analyses of pollen grains from homozygous osppgm-1 lines produced by anther culture confirmed the starch null phenotype, pollen from homozygous osagpl4 mutant lines, osagpl4-2 and osagpl4-3, generated by the CRISPR/Cas system, accumulated small amounts of starch which were sufficient to produce viable seed. Such osagpl4 mutant pollen, however, was unable to compete against WT pollen successfully, validating the important role of this reserve in fertilization. Our results demonstrate that starch is mainly polymerized from ADP-Glc synthesized from plastidic hexose phosphates in rice pollen and that starch is an essential requirement for successful fertilization in rice.
27582185	Identification of gamma ray irradiation-induced mutations in membrane transport genes in a rice population by TILLING.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	A high-salt environment represents environmental stress for most plants. Those that can grow and thrive in such an environment must have membrane transport systems that can respond effectively. Plant roots absorb Na+ from the soil, and the plant must maintain Na+ homeostasis to survive salt stress. A major mechanism by which salt-tolerant plants adapt to salt stress is through modulation of ion transport genes. We have subjected a population of rice plants to mutagenesis, and identified lines with both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in membrane transport genes and altered responses to salt stress. Primers labeled with FAM or HEX fluorescent dyes were designed for nine target genes encoding membrane transport proteins that are believed to regulate salt stress tolerance. A TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genome) assay was performed on 2,961 M2 rice mutant lines using electrophoresis. After the TILLING assay, a total of 41 mutant lines containing SNPs in the target genes were identified and screened. The average number of mutations per gene was 1/492 kb in lines having SNPs, and the percentage of mutation sites per total sequence was 0.67. Among the 41 lines, nine had altered sequences in the exon region of the genes. Of these nine lines, seven were tolerant to salt stress after exposure to 170 mM NaCl for three weeks, while the other two lines were not more salt-tolerant than the control lines. Furthermore, five mutant lines containing SNPs in the coding region of OsAKT1, OsHKT6, OsNSCC2, OsHAK11 and OsSOS1 showed changed expression levels for each gene. We conclude that variation in membrane transport genes, such as expression levels and protein structures, may affect the rice plant's tolerance to salt stress. These mutations represent traits that may be selected for large rice mutant populations, permitting efficient acquisition of salt-tolerant lines.
27639642	Expression and promoter analysis of the OsHSP16.9C gene in rice.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are molecular chaperones important for stress tolerance. In this study, heat induction of a rice sHSP gene OsHSP16.9C is analyzed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation in heat shock responses in rice. Promoter deletion analysis of the OsHSP16.9C using the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene in transgenic rice identifies a critical role of a promoter fragment containing an imperfect heat shock element (HSE) in heat induction. HSE was shown to be important for heat induction of AtHSP18.2, a homolog of OsHSP16.9C in Arabidopsis. In addition, the rice OsHSP16.9C promoter confers heat induction of the reporter gene expression in Arabidopsis. These data suggest that the heat induction mechanisms of OsHSP16.9C and AtHSP18.2 are similar in rice and Arabidopsis. The transgenic reporter line generated offers a system to genetically dissect signaling events in heat induction in rice.
27592839	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase regulation in C4-PEPC-expressing transgenic rice during early responses to drought stress.	2017	Physiol Plant	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC; EC 4.1.1.31) has important functions in C4 photosynthesis and biosynthesis of intermediate metabolites. In this study, the drought resistance of C4-PEPC-expressing transgenic rice (Oryza sativa, line PC) plants was assessed using simulated drought conditions [i.e. polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 treatment]. The dry weight of PC plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants following treatment with 15% PEG-6000 for 16 days. Furthermore, the water use efficiency, relative water content and proline content in PC plants were higher than those of WT plants, as were C4-PEPC activity and transcript levels following treatment with 5% PEG-6000 for 2 h. The protein kinase activities and transcript levels of sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) genes, such as SnRK1a, OsK24 and OsK35 were also higher in PC plants than in WT plants following treatment with 5% PEG-6000 for 2 h. Additionally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK, EC 4.1.1.32) activities and transcript levels (e.g. PPCK1 and PPCK2) increased following drought treatment. These changes were regulated by signaling molecules, such as calcium, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the -1095 to -416 region of the C4-PEPC promoter in PC plants was demethylated following exposure to drought conditions for 1 h. The demethylation coincided with an increase in C4-PEPC expression. Our data suggest that the demethylation of the C4-PEPC promoter and the phosphorylation catalyzed by PPCK have key roles in conferring drought tolerance to the transgenic rice plants.
27695459	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in <i>Oryza sativa</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles, whose basic enzymatic constituents are catalase and H2O2-producing flavin oxidases. Previous reports showed that peroxisome is involved in numerous processes including primary and secondary metabolism, plant development and abiotic stress responses. However, knowledge on the function of different peroxisome genes from rice and its regulatory roles in salt and other abiotic stresses is limited. Here, a novel prey protein, OsPEX11 (Os03g0302000), was screened and identified by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. Phenotypic analysis of OsPEX11 overexpression seedlings demonstrated that they had better tolerance to salt stress than wild type (WT) and OsPEX11-RNAi seedlings. Compared with WT and OsPEX11-RNAi seedlings, overexpression of OsPEX11 had lower level of lipid peroxidation, Na+/K+ ratio, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) and proline accumulation. Furthermore, qPCR data suggested that OsPEX11 acted as a positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of several well-known rice transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a, OsLti6b, OsSOS1, OsNHX1, and OsAKT1) involved in Na+/K+ homeostasis in transgenic plants under salinity. Ultrastructural observations of OsPEX11-RNAi seedlings showed that they were less sensitive to salt stress than WT and overexpression lines. These results provide experimental evidence that OsPEX11 is an important gene implicated in Na+ and K+ regulation, and plays a critical role in salt stress tolerance by modulating the expression of cation transporters and antioxidant defense. Thus, OsPEX11 could be considered in transgenic breeding for improvement of salt stress tolerance in rice crop.
27703462	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit e (OseIF3e) Influences Organ Size and Pollen Maturation.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a large protein complex that participates in most translation initiation processes. While eIF3 has been well characterized, less is known about the roles of individual eIF3 subunits, particularly in plants. Here, we identified and characterized OseIF3e in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OseIF3e was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but most strongly in vigorously growing organs. Transgenic OseIF3e-silenced rice plants showed inhibited growth in seedling and vegetative stages. Repression of OseIF3e led to defects in pollen maturation but did not affect pollen mitosis. In rice, eIF3e interacted with eIF3 subunits b, d, e, f, h, and k, and with eIF6, forming homo- and heterodimers to initiate translation. Furthermore, OseIF3e was shown by yeast two-hybrid assay to specifically bind to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 5, and 6. This interaction was mediated by the sequence of amino acid residues at positions 118-138, which included a conserved motif (IGPEQIETLYQFAKF). These results suggested although OseIF3e is not a "functional core" subunit of eIF3, it still plays crucial roles in rice growth and development, in combination with other factors. We proposed a pathway by which OseIF3e influence organ size and pollen maturation in rice, providing an opportunity to optimize plant architecture for crop breeding.
27621422	Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance.	2016	Plant Physiol	Alternative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that alternative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the alternatively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice (Oryza sativa) LAMMER kinase gene OsDR11, long OsDR11L and short OsDR11S, play opposite roles in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Overexpressing OsDR11S or suppressing OsDR11L in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing OsDR11S was associated with increased susceptibility to Xoo, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of OsDR11S suppressed OsDR11L expression. OsDR11 appeared to contribute to a minor quantitative trait locus against Xoo These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to resistance against Xoo.
27611904	Aldo-keto reductase enzymes detoxify glyphosate and improve herbicide resistance in plants.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	In recent years, concerns about the use of glyphosate-resistant crops have increased because of glyphosate residual levels in plants and development of herbicide-resistant weeds. In spite of identifying glyphosate-detoxifying genes from microorganisms, the plant mechanism to detoxify glyphosate has not been studied. We characterized an aldo-keto reductase gene from Pseudomonas (PsAKR1) and rice (OsAKR1) and showed, by docking studies, both PsAKR1 and OsAKR1 can efficiently bind to glyphosate. Silencing AKR1 homologues in rice and Nicotiana benthamiana or mutation of AKR1 in yeast and Arabidopsis showed increased sensitivity to glyphosate. External application of AKR proteins rescued glyphosate-mediated cucumber seedling growth inhibition. Regeneration of tobacco transgenic lines expressing PsAKR1 or OsAKRI on glyphosate suggests that AKR can be used as selectable marker to develop transgenic crops. PsAKR1- or OsAKRI-expressing tobacco and rice transgenic plants showed improved tolerance to glyphosate with reduced accumulation of shikimic acid without affecting the normal photosynthetic rates. These results suggested that AKR1 when overexpressed detoxifies glyphosate in planta.
27663411	A Rice Ca2+ Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation.	2016	Plant Physiol	In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca2+ is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (Oryza sativa), a Ca2+ binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In osdex1 anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. OsDEX1 is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca2+ and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in vitro, and osdex1 exhibited disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca2+ in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) dex1 mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca2+ homeostasis during pollen development.
27622591	The RNA Editing Factor WSP1 Is Essential for Chloroplast Development in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	Although the multiple organellar RNA editing factors (MORFs) in the plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana have been extensively studied, molecular details underlying how MORFs affect plant development in other species, particularly in rice, remain largely unknown. Here we describe the characterization of wsp1, a rice mutant with white-stripe leaves and panicles. Notably, wsp1 exhibited nearly white immature panicles at the heading stage. Transmission electron microscopy analysis and chlorophyll content measurement revealed a chloroplast developmental defect and reduced chlorophyll accumulation in wsp1. Positional cloning of WSP1 found a point mutation in Os04g51280, whose putative product shares high sequence similarity with MORF proteins. Complementation experiments demonstrated that WSP1 was responsible for the variegated phenotypes of wsp1. WSP1 is localized to chloroplasts and the point mutation in wsp1 affected the editing of multiple organellar RNA sites. Owing to the defect in plastid RNA editing, chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and ndhA splicing were also impaired in wsp1, which may affect normal chloroplast development in the leaves and panicles at the heading stage. Together, our results demonstrate the importance of rice WSP1 protein in chloroplast development and broaden our knowledge about MORF family members in rice.
27669230	Genome-Wide Characterization and Expression Analysis of the Germin-Like Protein Family in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Previous studies have shown that germin-like proteins (GLPs) are present ubiquitously in rice and Arabidopsis. However, the understanding regarding their role in development and abiotic/biotic stress resistance remains limited. In the present study, we report genome-wide identification, characterisation, subcellular localization, enzyme activity, and expression analysis of the GLP gene family in rice and Arabidopsis to study their functions. In total, 43 and 32 GLPs in the rice and Arabidopsis genome were identified based on a systematic analysis, respectively. The GLP genes were clustered into six clades based on phylogenetic analysis, and many stress and developmental-related cis-elements were detected in promoters of GLP genes. In addition, subcellular location and superoxide dismutase (SOD) analysis demonstrated that the random selected OsGLP genes on chromosomes 8 and 4 of rice were expressed in the cell wall with SOD activity. Overall, our results showed that tandem duplication events, especially the clusters of tandem duplication genes on chromosome 8 in rice, play a major role in expansion of the GLP family and thus increase our understanding of the role of the GLP family in abiotic/biotic stress and development.
27677631	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of qHD5, a novel major QTL with pleiotropism for yield-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A major QTL for heading date, qHD5, was fine-mapped to a 52.59-kb region on the short arm of rice chromosome 5. Heading date (HD) is one of the most important traits that enables rice to adapt to seasonal differences and specific growth conditions in diverse growing regions. In this study, a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL), qHD5, was resolved as a single Medelian factor that causes NIL(BG1) and NIL(XLJ) (two near-isogenic lines (NILs) used in our study) to have at a minimum of 10-day difference in HD under both long-day and short-day conditions in rice. qHD5 was initially mapped to a 309.52-kb genomic region in our previous study. Here, using an advanced BC4F3 population and map-based cloning, we further narrowed the location of qHD5 to a 52.59-kb region between the H71 and RD502 markers. Sequence analysis revealed that Os05g03040, which putatively encodes an AP2 (APETALA2) transcription factor, has six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between NIL(BG1) and NIL(XLJ). On this basis, this gene was concluded to be the most probable candidate gene for qHD5. Our results also showed that Hd3a, RFT1, Hd1, Ehd1, and Ghd7 were differentially expressed in the two NILs. Moreover, qHD5 was found to affect yield-related traits such as flag leaf width, flag leaf length, branch number, and 1000-grain weight.
27631432	The germin-like protein OsGLP2-1 enhances resistance to fungal blast and bacterial blight in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: This is the first report that GLP gene (OsGLP2-1) is involved in panicle blast and bacterial blight resistance in rice. In addition to its resistance to blast and bacterial blight, OsGLP2-1 has also been reported to co-localize with a QTLs for sheath blight resistance in rice. These suggest that the disease resistance provided by OsGLP2-1 is quantitative and broad spectrum. Its good resistance to these major diseases in rice makes it to be a promising target in rice breeding. Rice (Oryza sativa) blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae are the two most destructive rice diseases worldwide. Germin-like protein (GLP) gene family is one of the important defense gene families which have been reported to be involved in disease resistance in plants. Although GLP proteins have been demonstrated to positively regulate leaf blast resistance in rice, their involvement in resistance to panicle blast and bacterial blight, has not been reported. In this study, we reported that one of the rice GLP genes, OsGLP2-1, was significantly induced by blast fungus. Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight. The temporal and spatial expression analysis revealed that OsGLP2-1is highly expressed in leaves and panicles and sub-localized in the cell wall. Compared with empty vector transformed (control) plants, the OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants exhibited higher levels of H2O2 both before and after pathogen inoculation. Moreover, OsGLP2-1 was significantly induced by jasmonic acid (JA). Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection. Higher endogenous level of JA was also identified in OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants than in control plants both before and after pathogen inoculation. Together, these results suggest that OsGLP2-1 functions as a positive regulator to modulate disease resistance. Its good quantitative resistance to the two major diseases in rice makes it to be a promising target in rice breeding.
27677460	Rice Ferredoxin-Dependent Glutamate Synthase Regulates Nitrogen-Carbon Metabolomes and Is Genetically Differentiated between japonica and indica Subspecies.	2016	Mol Plant	Plants assimilate inorganic nitrogen absorbed from soil into organic forms as Gln and Glu through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine:2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle. Whereas GS catalyzes the formation of Gln from Glu and ammonia, GOGAT catalyzes the transfer of an amide group from Gln to 2-oxoglutarate to produce two molecules of Glu. However, the regulatory role of the GS/GOGAT cycle in the carbon-nitrogen balance is not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of rice ABNORMAL CYTOKININ RESPONSE 1 (ABC1) gene that encodes a ferredoxin-dependent (Fd)-GOGAT. The weak mutant allele abc1-1 mutant shows a typical nitrogen-deficient syndrome, whereas the T-DNA insertional mutant abc1-2 is seedling lethal. Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of an excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in abc1-1, suggesting that ABC1 plays a critical role in nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance. Five non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the ABC1 coding region and characterized as three distinct haplotypes, which have been highly and specifically differentiated between japonica and indica subspecies. Collectively, these results suggest that ABC1/OsFd-GOGAT is essential for plant growth and development by modulating nitrogen assimilation and the carbon-nitrogen balance.
27638689	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	CONSTANS (CO)-like genes have been intensively investigated for their roles in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering, but very limited information has been reported on their functions in other biological processes. Here, we found that a CO-like gene, Ghd2 (Grain number, plant height, and heading date2), which can increase the yield potential under normal growth condition just like its homologue Ghd7, is involved in the regulation of leaf senescence and drought resistance. Ghd2 is expressed mainly in the rice (Oryza sativa) leaf with the highest level detected at the grain-filling stage, and it is down-regulated by drought stress conditions. Overexpression of Ghd2 resulted in significantly reduced drought resistance, while its knockout mutant showed the opposite phenotype. The earlier senescence symptoms and the transcript up-regulation of many senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in Ghd2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants under drought stress conditions indicate that Ghd2 plays essential roles in accelerating drought-induced leaf senescence in rice. Moreover, developmental and dark-induced leaf senescence was accelerated in the Ghd2-overexpressing rice and delayed in the ghd2 mutant. Several SAGs were confirmed to be regulated by Ghd2 using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts. Ghd2 interacted with several regulatory proteins, including OsARID3, OsPURα, and three 14-3-3 proteins. OsARID3 and OsPURα showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions. These results indicate that Ghd2 functions as a regulator by integrating environmental signals with the senescence process into a developmental programme through interaction with different proteins.
27760723	OspTAC2 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and regulates rice chloroplast development.	2016	J Genet Genomics	Functional chloroplast generation depends on the precise coordination of gene expression between the plastid and the nucleus and is essential for plant growth and development. In this study, a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibited albino and seedling-lethal phenotypes was isolated from a60Co-irradiated rice population. The mutant gene was identified as an ortholog of the Arabidopsis plastid transcriptionally active chromosome protein 2 (pTAC2) gene, and the mutant strain was designated osptac2. Sequence and transcription analyses showed that OspTAC2 encodes a putative chloroplast protein consisting of 10 pentratricopeptide repeat (PPR) domains and a C-terminal small MutS-related (SMR) domain. Cytological observations via microscopy showed that the OspTAC2-green fluorescent fusion protein is localized in the chloroplasts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the chloroplast of the osptac2 mutant lacks an organized thylakoid membrane. The transcript levels of all investigated PEP (plastid-encoded RNA polymerase)-dependent genes were dramatically reduced in the osptac2 mutant, whereas the transcript levels of NEP (nuclear-encoded polymerase)-dependent genes were increased. These results suggest that OspTAC2 plays a critical role in chloroplast development and indicate that the molecular function of the OspTAC2 gene is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis.
27729915	A Systematic View of the <i>MLO</i> Family in Rice Suggests Their Novel Roles in Morphological Development, Diurnal Responses, the Light-Signaling Pathway, and Various Stress Responses.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The Mildew resistance Locus O (MLO) family is unique to plants, containing genes that were initially identified as a susceptibility factor to powdery mildew pathogens. However, little is known about the roles and functional diversity of this family in rice, a model crop plant. The rice genome has 12 potential MLO family members. To achieve systematic functional assignments, we performed a phylogenomic analysis by integrating meta-expression data obtained from public sources of microarray data and real-time expression data into a phylogenic tree. Subsequently, we identified 12 MLO genes with various tissue-preferred patterns, including leaf, root, pollen, and ubiquitous expression. This suggested their functional diversity for morphological agronomic traits. We also used these integrated transcriptome data within a phylogenetic context to estimate the functional redundancy or specificity among OsMLO family members. Here, OsMLO12 showed preferential expression in mature pollen; OsMLO4, in the root tips; OsMLO10, throughout the roots except at the tips; and OsMLO8, expression preferential to the leaves and trinucleate pollen. Of particular interest to us was the diurnal expression of OsMLO1, OsMLO3, and OsMLO8, which indicated that they are potentially significant in responses to environmental changes. In osdxr mutants that show defects in the light response, OsMLO1, OsMLO3, OsMLO8, and four calmodulin genes were down-regulated. This finding provides insight into the novel functions of MLO proteins associated with the light-responsive methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway. In addition, abiotic stress meta-expression data and real-time expression analysis implied that four and five MLO genes in rice are associated with responses to heat and cold stress, respectively. Upregulation of OsMLO3 by Magnaporthe oryzae infection further suggested that this gene participates in the response to pathogens. Our analysis has produced fundamental information that will enhance future studies of the diverse developmental or physiological phenomena mediated by the MLO family in this model plant system.
27581936	The rice OsSAG12-2 gene codes for a functional protease that negatively regulates stress-induced cell death.	2016	J Biosci	Senescence is the final stage of plant development. Although expression of most of the genes is suppressed during senescence, a set of genes referred as senescence-associated genes (SAGs) is induced. Arabidopsis thaliana SAG12 (AtSAG12) is one such gene that has been mostly studied for its strict association with senescence. AtSAG12 encodes a papain-like cysteine protease, expressed predominantly in senescence-associated vacuoles. Rice genome contains multiple AtSAG12 homologues (OsSAGs). OsSAG12-1, the closest structural homologue of AtSAG12, is a negative regulator of developmental and stress-induced cell death. Proteolytic activity has not been established for any SAG12 homologues in vitro. Here, we report that OsSAG12-2, the second structural homologue of AtSAG12 from rice, codes for a functional proteolytic enzyme. The recombinant OsSAG12-2 protein produced in Escherichia coli undergoes autolysis to generate a functional protease. The matured OsSAG12-2 protein shows 27 percent trypsin-equivalent proteolytic activity on azocasein substrate. Dark-induced senescence activates OsSAG12-2 expression. Down-regulation of OsSAG12-2 in the transgenic artificial miRNA lines results in enhanced salt- and UV-induced cell death, even though it does not affect cell viability in the stress-free condition. Our results show that OsSAG12-2 codes for a functional protease that negatively regulates stress-induced cell death in rice.
27795673	A single amino acid mutation of <i>OsSBEIIb</i> contributes to resistant starch accumulation in rice.	2016	Breed Sci	Foods rich in resistant starch can help prevent various diseases, including diabetes, colon cancers, diarrhea, and chronic renal and hepatic diseases. Variations in starch biosynthesis enzymes could contribute to the high content of resistant starch in some cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Our previously published work indicated that the sbe3-rs gene in the rice mutant line, 'Jiangtangdao1' was a putative allele of the rice starch branching enzyme gene SBEIIb (previously known as SBE3); sbe3-rs might control the biosynthesis of the high resistant starch content in the rice line. Biomolecular analysis showed that the activity of SBEs was significantly lower in soluble extracts of immature seeds harvested from 'Jiangtangdao1' 15 days after flowering than in the extracts of the wild-type rice line 'Huaqingdao'. We performed gene complementation assays by introducing the wild-type OsSBEIIb into the sbe3-rs mutant 'Jiangtangdao1'. The genetically complemented lines demonstrated restored seed-related traits. The structures of endosperm amylopectin and the morphological and physicochemical properties of the starch granules in the transformants recovered to wild-type levels. This study provides evidence that sbe3-rs is a novel allele of OsSBEIIb, responsible for biosynthesis of high resistant starch in 'Jiangtangdao1'.
27639962	Overexpression of a glyoxalase gene, OsGly I, improves abiotic stress tolerance and grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Glyoxalase I (Gly I) is a component of the glyoxalase system which is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis. In the present study, a gene of rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Nipponbare) encoding Gly I was cloned and characterized. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that rice Gly I (OsGly I) was ubiquitously expressed in root, stem, leaf, leaf sheath and spikelet with varying abundance. OsGly I was markedly upregulated in response to NaCl, ZnCl2 and mannitol in rice seedlings. For further functional investigation, OsGly I was overexpressed in rice using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic rice lines exhibited increased glyoxalase enzyme activity, decreased methylglyoxal level and improved tolerance to NaCl, ZnCl2 and mannitol compared to wild-type plants. Enhancement of stress tolerance in transgenic lines was associated with reduction of malondialdehyde content which was derived from cellular lipid peroxidation. In addition, the OsGly I-overexpression transgenic plants performed higher seed setting rate and yield. Collectively, these results indicate the potential of bioengineering the Gly I gene in crops.
27998028	Ectopic expression of specific GA2 oxidase mutants promotes yield and stress tolerance in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	A major challenge of modern agricultural biotechnology is the optimization of plant architecture for enhanced productivity, stress tolerance and water use efficiency (WUE). To optimize plant height and tillering that directly link to grain yield in cereals and are known to be tightly regulated by gibberellins (GAs), we attenuated the endogenous levels of GAs in rice via its degradation. GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) is a key enzyme that inactivates endogenous GAs and their precursors. We identified three conserved domains in a unique class of C20 GA2ox, GA2ox6, which is known to regulate the architecture and function of rice plants. We mutated nine specific amino acids in these conserved domains and observed a gradient of effects on plant height. Ectopic expression of some of these GA2ox6 mutants moderately lowered GA levels and reprogrammed transcriptional networks, leading to reduced plant height, more productive tillers, expanded root system, higher WUE and photosynthesis rate, and elevated abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in transgenic rice. Combinations of these beneficial traits conferred not only drought and disease tolerance but also increased grain yield by 10-30% in field trials. Our studies hold the promise of manipulating GA levels to substantially improve plant architecture, stress tolerance and grain yield in rice and possibly in other major crops.
28029738	DRO1 influences root system architecture in Arabidopsis and Prunus species.	2017	Plant J	Roots provide essential uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, as well as anchorage and stability for the whole plant. Root orientation, or angle, is an important component of the overall architecture and depth of the root system; however, little is known about the genetic control of this trait. Recent reports in Oryza sativa (rice) identified a role for DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) in influencing the orientation of the root system, leading to positive changes in grain yields under water-limited conditions. Here we found that DRO1 and DRO1-related genes are present across diverse plant phyla, and fall within the IGT gene family. The IGT family also includes TAC1 and LAZY1, which are known to affect the orientation of lateral shoots. Consistent with a potential role in root development, DRO1 homologs in Arabidopsis and peach showed root-specific expression. Promoter-reporter constructs revealed that AtDRO1 is predominantly expressed in both the root vasculature and root tips, in a distinct developmental pattern. Mutation of AtDRO1 led to more horizontal lateral root angles. Overexpression of AtDRO1 under a constitutive promoter resulted in steeper lateral root angles, as well as shoot phenotypes including upward leaf curling, shortened siliques and narrow lateral branch angles. A conserved C-terminal EAR-like motif found in IGT genes was required for these ectopic phenotypes. Overexpression of PpeDRO1 in Prunus domestica (plum) led to deeper-rooting phenotypes. Collectively, these data indicate a potential application for DRO1-related genes to alter root architecture for drought avoidance and improved resource use.
28034842	Effects of genome doubling on expression of genes regulating grain size in rice.	2016	Yi Chuan	Rice is one of the most important staple crops. It has been the major focus in breeding program to improve grain yield. A unique feature of tetraploid rice is the increased grain size and weight compared to diploid. Therefore, investigating the effects of genome doubling on expression of genes regulating grain size is important for yield improvement in rice breeding program. In this study, we analyzed differential expression of six genes regulating grain size in young panicles of various developmental stages between diploid and tetraploid rice. Transgenic approaches were employed to explore the dosage effects on gene expression and grain size. The results showed that genome duplications did not influence the developmental patterns of rice growth, but enhanced plant height, leaf width and grain size. The grain length and width in Indica tetraploid increased significantly, but the grain length showed more obvious change than width in Japonica tetraploid. The expression levels were affected not only by the developmental stages, but also by genetic background. Upon genome doubling, the positive regulation gene GS5 and HGW expression levels were generally higher in tetraploid than the corresponding diploid. Negative regulation gene GS3 in Indica tetraploid tended to be down-regulated or silenced, but increased in Japonica tetraploid. Another negative regulation GW2 was up-regulated in Indica tetraploid and silenced in Japonica tetraploid. The extra copies of GW2 in diploid transgenic lines exerted a gene dosage effect that resulted in the higher expression level than that of wild type diploid and tetraploid, which causes small grain formation in transgenic lines. Our results will help to understand the function of genes regulating the grain size in the diploid and tetraploid, and provide a theoretical basis for yield improvement.
27940610	RPAN: rice pan-genome browser for ∼3000 rice genomes.	2017	Nucleic Acids Res	A pan-genome is the union of the gene sets of all the individuals of a clade or a species and it provides a new dimension of genome complexity with the presence/absence variations (PAVs) of genes among these genomes. With the progress of sequencing technologies, pan-genome study is becoming affordable for eukaryotes with large-sized genomes. The Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L., is one of the major food sources for the world and a model organism in plant biology. Recently, the 3000 Rice Genome Project (3K RGP) sequenced more than 3000 rice genomes with a mean sequencing depth of 14.3×, which provided a tremendous resource for rice research. In this paper, we present a genome browser, Rice Pan-genome Browser (RPAN), as a tool to search and visualize the rice pan-genome derived from 3K RGP. RPAN contains a database of the basic information of 3010 rice accessions, including genomic sequences, gene annotations, PAV information and gene expression data of the rice pan-genome. At least 12 000 novel genes absent in the reference genome were included. RPAN also provides multiple search and visualization functions. RPAN can be a rich resource for rice biology and rice breeding. It is available at http://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/3kricedb/ or http://www.rmbreeding.cn/pan3k.
28019048	Temporal and spatial changes in gene expression, metabolite accumulation and phytohormone content in rice seedlings grown under drought stress conditions.	2017	Plant J	In order to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of plants to different levels of drought stress, we developed a soil matric potential (SMP)-based irrigation system that precisely controls soil moisture. Using this system, rice seedlings were grown under three different drought levels, denoted Md1, Md2 and Md3, with SMP values set to -9.8, -31.0 and -309.9 kPa, respectively. Although the Md1 treatment did not alter the visible phenotype, the Md2 treatment caused stomatal closure and shoot growth retardation (SGR). The Md3 treatment markedly induced SGR, without inhibition of photosynthesis. More severe drought (Sds) treatment, under which irrigation was terminated, resulted in the wilting of leaves and inhibition of photosynthesis. Metabolome analysis revealed the accumulation of primary sugars under Md3 and Sds and of most amino acids under Sds. The starch content was increased under Md3 and decreased under Sds. Transcriptome data showed that the expression profiles of associated genes supported the observed changes in photosynthesis and metabolites, suggesting that the time lag from SGR to inhibition of photosynthesis might lead to the accumulation of photosynthates under Md3, which can be used as osmolytes under Sds. To gain further insight into the observed SGR, transcriptome and hormonome analyses were performed in specific tissues. The results showed specific decreases in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin levels in Md2-, Md3- and Sds-treated shoot bases, though the expression levels of hormone metabolism-related genes were not reflected in IAA and cytokinin contents. These observations suggest that drought stress affects the distribution or degradation of cytokinin and IAA molecules.
28018418	Plastoquinone and Ubiquinone in Plants: Biosynthesis, Physiological Function and Metabolic Engineering.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plastoquinone (PQ) and ubiquinone (UQ) are two important prenylquinones, functioning as electron transporters in the electron transport chain of oxygenic photosynthesis and the aerobic respiratory chain, respectively, and play indispensable roles in plant growth and development through participating in the biosynthesis and metabolism of important chemical compounds, acting as antioxidants, being involved in plant response to stress, and regulating gene expression and cell signal transduction. UQ, particularly UQ10, has also been widely used in people's life. It is effective in treating cardiovascular diseases, chronic gingivitis and periodontitis, and shows favorable impact on cancer treatment and human reproductive health. PQ and UQ are made up of an active benzoquinone ring attached to a polyisoprenoid side chain. Biosynthesis of PQ and UQ is very complicated with more than thirty five enzymes involved. Their synthetic pathways can be generally divided into two stages. The first stage leads to the biosynthesis of precursors of benzene quinone ring and prenyl side chain. The benzene quinone ring for UQ is synthesized from tyrosine or phenylalanine, whereas the ring for PQ is derived from tyrosine. The prenyl side chains of PQ and UQ are derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate through the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and/or acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The second stage includes the condensation of ring and side chain and subsequent modification. Homogentisate solanesyltransferase, 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl diphosphate transferase and a series of benzene quinone ring modification enzymes are involved in this stage. PQ exists in plants, while UQ widely presents in plants, animals and microbes. Many enzymes and their encoding genes involved in PQ and UQ biosynthesis have been intensively studied recently. Metabolic engineering of UQ10 in plants, such as rice and tobacco, has also been tested. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent research progresses in the biosynthetic pathways of PQ and UQ and enzymes and their encoding genes involved in side chain elongation and in the second stage of PQ and UQ biosynthesis. Physiological functions of PQ and UQ played in plants as well as the practical application and metabolic engineering of PQ and UQ are also included.
28004781	Functional insights into the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein family from Dendrobium officinale (Orchidaceae) using an Escherichia coli system.	2016	Sci Rep	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, a diverse family, accumulate during seed desiccation in the later stages of embryogenesis. LEA proteins are associated with tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity and high or cold temperature. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of the LEA gene family in Dendrobium officinale, an important and widely grown medicinal orchid in China. Based on phylogenetic relationships with the complete set of Arabidopsis and Oryza LEA proteins, 17 genes encoding D. officinale LEAs (DofLEAs) were identified and their deduced proteins were classified into seven groups. The motif composition of these deduced proteins was correlated with the gene structure found in each LEA group. Our results reveal the DofLEA genes are widely distributed and expressed in tissues. Additionally, 11 genes from different groups were introduced into Escherichia coli to assess the functions of DofLEAs. Expression of 6 and 7 DofLEAs in E. coli improved growth performance compared with the control under salt and heat stress, respectively. Based on qPCR data, all of these genes were up-regulated in various tissues following exposure to salt and heat stresses. Our results suggest that DofLEAs play an important role in responses to abiotic stress.
27936403	Arsenic accumulation and speciation in rice grown in arsanilic acid-elevated paddy soil.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	P-arsanilic acid (AsA) is a emerging but less concerned contaminant used in animal feeding operations, for it can be degraded to more toxic metabolites after being excreted by animals. Rice is the staple food in many parts of the world, and also more efficient in accumulating arsenic (As) compared to other cereals. However, the uptake and transformation of AsA by rice is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of using AsA as a feed additive and using the AsA contaminated animal manure as a fertilizer. Five rice cultivars were grown in soil containing 100mg AsA/kg soil, after harvest, As species and their concentrations in different tissues were determined. Total As concentration of the hybrid rice cultivar was more than conventional rice cultivars for whole rice plant. For rice organs, the highest As concentration was found in roots. AsA could be absorbed by rice, partly degraded and converted to arsenite, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenate. The number of As species and their concentrations in each cultivar were related to their genotypes. The soil containing 100mg AsA/kg or more is unsuitable for growing rice. The use of AsA and the disposal of animal manure requires detailed attention.
27997534	DNA Methylation Signatures of the Plant Chromomethyltransferases.	2016	PLoS Genet	DNA methylation in plants is traditionally partitioned into CG, CHG and CHH contexts (with H any nucleotide but G). By investigating DNA methylation patterns in trinucleotide contexts in four angiosperm species, we show that such a representation hides spatial and functional partitioning of different methylation pathways and is incomplete. CG methylation (mCG) is largely context-independent whereas, at CHG motifs, there is under-representation of mCCG in pericentric regions of A. thaliana and tomato and throughout the chromosomes of maize and rice. In A. thaliana the biased representation of mCCG in heterochromatin is related to specificities of H3K9 methyltransferase SUVH family members. At CHH motifs there is an over-representation of different variant forms of mCHH that, similarly to mCCG hypomethylation, is partitioned into the pericentric regions of the two dicots but dispersed in the monocot chromosomes. The over-represented mCHH motifs in A. thaliana associate with specific types of transposon including both class I and II elements. At mCHH the contextual bias is due to the involvement of various chromomethyltransferases whereas the context-independent CHH methylation in A. thaliana and tomato is mediated by the RNA-directed DNA methylation process that is most active in the gene-rich euchromatin. This analysis therefore reveals that the sequence context of the methylome of plant genomes is informative about the mechanisms associated with maintenance of methylation and the overlying chromatin structure.
27905090	Marker-assisted breeding of the rice restorer line Wanhui 6725 for disease resistance, submergence tolerance and aromatic fragrance.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is a staple food crop in the world. With the increase in world population and economic development, farmers need to produce more rice in limited field. However, the rice production is frequently affected by biotic and abiotic stresses. The use of natural disease resistance and stress tolerance through genetic breeding is the most efficient and economical way to combat or acclimate to these stresses. In addition, rice with aromatic fragrance can significantly increase market value for its good grain quality. Mianhui 725 (MH725) is an elite restorer line that has been widely used to produce three-line hybrid rice in China. We previously introduced rice bacterial blight resistance genes Xa4 and Xa21 into MH725 and obtained an introgression rice line Wanhui 421 (WH421), which theoretically possesses 96.9% genetic background of MH725.

RESULTS: Here we report the introduction and pyramiding of disease resistance genes Xa27 and Pi9, submergence tolerance gene Sub1A and aromatic fragrance gene badh2.1 in WH421 through backcrossing and marker-assisted selection. The newly developed introgression rice line was designated as Wanhui 6725 (WH6725), which theoretically possesses 95.0% genetic background of MH725. WH6725 and its hybrid rice conferred disease resistance to both blast and bacterial blight diseases and showed tolerance to submergence for over 14 days without significant loss of viability. Compared with non-aromatic rice MH725, WH6725 has strong aromatic fragrance. The major important agronomic traits and grain quality of WH6725 and its hybrid rice obtained in field trials were similar to those of MH725 and the control hybrid rice, indicating that WH6725 is as good as MH725 when it is used as a restorer line for three-line hybrid rice production.

CONCLUSION: We have successfully developed a new restorer line WH6725 with disease resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight, tolerance to submergence and aromatic fragrance, which can be used to replace MH725 for hybrid rice production.
28008334	Transcriptome Analysis Highlights Defense and Signaling Pathways Mediated by Rice <i>pi21</i> Gene with Partial Resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. The pi21 gene confers partial and durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21. In this study, comparative transcriptome profiling of the Pi21-RNAi transgenic rice line and Nipponbare with M. oryzae infection at different time points (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi) were investigated using RNA sequencing. The results generated 43,222 unique genes mapped to the rice genome. In total, 1109 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the Pi21-RNAi line and Nipponbare with M. oryzae infection, with 103, 281, 209, 69, and 678 DEGs at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, respectively. Functional analysis showed that most of the DEGs were involved in metabolism, transport, signaling, and defense. Among the genes assigned to plant-pathogen interaction, we identified 43 receptor kinase genes associated with pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition and calcium ion influx. The expression levels of brassinolide-insensitive 1, flagellin sensitive 2, and elongation factor Tu receptor, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling genes, were higher in the Pi21-RNAi line than Nipponbare. This suggested that there was a more robust PTI response in Pi21-RNAi plants and that ET signaling was important to rice blast resistance. We also identified 53 transcription factor genes, including WRKY, NAC, DOF, and ERF families that show differential expression between the two genotypes. This study highlights possible candidate genes that may serve a function in the partial rice blast resistance mediated by the loss-of-function of Pi21 and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in partial resistance against M. oryzae.
28028166	Potato Tuber Induction is Regulated by Interactions Between Components of a Tuberigen Complex.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Photoperiod-regulated flowering and potato tuber formation involve leaf-produced mobile signals, florigen and tuberigen, respectively. The major protein component of florigen has been identified as the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein. In rice, an FT-like protein, Heading date 3a (Hd3a), induces flowering by making the florigen activation complex (FAC) through interactions with 14-3-3 and OsFD1, a rice FD-like protein. In potato, StSP6A, an FT-like protein, was identified as a major component of tuberigen. However, the molecular mechanism of how StSP6A triggers tuber formation remains elusive. Here we analyzed the significance of the formation of a complex including StSP6A, 14-3-3 and FD-like proteins in tuberization. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vitro pull-down assays showed that StSP6A and StFDL1, a potato FD-like protein, interact with St14-3-3s. StSP6A overexpression induced early tuberization in a 14-3-3-dependent manner, and suppression of StFDL1 delayed tuberization. These results strongly suggest that an FAC-like complex, the tuberigen activation complex (TAC), comprised of StSP6A, St14-3-3s and StFDL1, regulates potato tuber formation.
27978435	An E3 Ubiquitin Ligase-BAG Protein Module Controls Plant Innate Immunity and Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.	2016	Cell Host Microbe	Programmed cell death (PCD) and immunity in plants are tightly controlled to promote antimicrobial defense while preventing autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms contributing to this immune homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we isolated a rice mutant ebr1 (enhanced blight and blast resistance 1) that shows enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial and fungal disease resistance, but displays spontaneous PCD, autoimmunity, and stunted growth. EBR1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with OsBAG4, which belongs to the BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) family that functions in cell death, growth arrest, and immune responses in mammals. EBR1 directly targets OsBAG4 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Elevated levels of OsBAG4 in rice are necessary and sufficient to trigger PCD and enhanced disease resistance to pathogenic infection, most likely by activating pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI). Together, our study suggests that an E3-BAG module orchestrates innate immune homeostasis and coordinates the trade-off between defense and growth in plants.
28035023	Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1) regulates brassinosteroid-mediated activation of AMT1;2 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	J Exp Bot	The promotive effects of brassinosteroids (BRs) on plant growth and development have been widely investigated; however, it is not known whether BRs directly affect nutrient uptake. Here, we explored the possibility of a direct relationship between BRs and ammonium uptake via AMT1-type genes in rice (Oryza sativa). BR treatment increased the expression of AMT1;1 and AMT1;2, whereas in the mutant d61-1, which is defective in the BR-receptor gene BRI1, BR-dependent expression of these genes was suppressed. We then employed Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1), which is involved in BR homeostasis, to investigate BR-mediated AMT1 expression and its effect on NH4+ uptake in rice roots. AMT1;2 expression was lower in the ravl1 mutant, but higher in the RAVL1-overexpressing lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that RAVL1 activates the expression of AMT1;2 by directly binding to E-box motifs in its promoter. Moreover, 15NH4+ uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels. Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2. Thus, the present study shows how BRs may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of nutrient transporters to modulate their uptake capacity.
27576685	A Genome-Wide Association Study of Field Resistance to Magnaporthe Oryzae in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Breeding of rice cultivars with long-lasting resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is difficult, and identification of new resistance genes is essential. Most of the loci associated with blast resistance against M. oryzae in rice have been identified in controlled environments and with single isolates, and such loci may confer resistance to only a small faction of the M. oryzae strains. In the field, however, rice is commonly attacked by multiple strains. Research is therefore needed to identify loci that confer resistance in the field, i.e., "field blast resistance". To identify loci associated with field blast resistance (LAFBRs), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) cultivars. These cultivars were evaluated in the field in three major rice production areas of China.

RESULTS: GWAS identified 16 LAFBRs. Among them, 13 are novel and the other three are co-localized with known blast resistance regions. Seventy-four candidate genes are identified in the 16 LAFBR regions, which encode receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors, and other defense-related proteins. Using the rice transcriptome data, compared with the rice-rice blast compatible interaction, we identified seven candidate genes that are significantly up-regulated and five genes that are significantly down-regulated in the incompatible interaction among the candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS: We identified 16 LAFBRs involved in field resistance to M. oryzae and 20 cultivars that exhibit high levels of resistance in both the field and growth chamber. The resistant cultivars and the SNP markers identified in this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection of new rice cultivars that confer high levels of resistance against M. oryzae field populations.
27910002	The Rice Pentatricopeptide Repeat Gene TCD10 is Needed for Chloroplast Development under Cold Stress.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Chloroplast plays a vital role in plant development and growth. The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene family is one of the largest gene families in plants. In addition, cold stress affects a broad spectrum of cellular components, e.g. chloroplast, and metabolism in plants. However, the regulatory mechanism for rice PPR genes on chloroplast development still remains elusive under cold stress.

RESULT: In this paper, we characterized a new rice PPR gene mutant tcd10 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 10) that exhibits the albino phenotype, malformed chloroplast and could not survive after the 5-leaf stage when grown at 20 °C, but does the normal phenotype at 32 °C. Map-based cloning, followed by RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques, revealed that TCD10 encoding a novel PPR protein, mainly localized to the chloroplasts, with 27 PPR motifs, is responsible for the mutant phenotype. In addition, TCD10 is specific expression in tissues. The disruption of TCD10 resulted in an evidently reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes under cold stress (20 °C), whereas they did recovered to normal levels at high temperature (32 °C). These results showed an important role of TCD10 for chloroplast development under cold stress.

CONCLUSIONS: The TCD10 encodes a novel rice PPR protein, mainly located in chloroplasts, which is important for chloroplast development, growth and the maintenance of photosynthetic electron transport and its disorder would lead to an aberrant chloroplast and abnormal expressions in these genes for chloroplast development and photosynthesis in rice under cold stress.
28028232	Two independent S-phase checkpoints regulate appressorium-mediated plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	To cause rice blast disease, the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae develops a specialized infection structure called an appressorium. This dome-shaped, melanin-pigmented cell generates enormous turgor and applies physical force to rupture the rice leaf cuticle using a rigid penetration peg. Appressorium-mediated infection requires septin-dependent reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton at the base of the infection cell, which organizes polarity determinants necessary for plant cell invasion. Here, we show that plant infection by M. oryzae requires two independent S-phase cell-cycle checkpoints. Initial formation of appressoria on the rice leaf surface requires an S-phase checkpoint that acts through the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, involving the Cds1 kinase. By contrast, appressorium repolarization involves a novel, DDR-independent S-phase checkpoint, triggered by appressorium turgor generation and melanization. This second checkpoint specifically regulates septin-dependent, NADPH oxidase-regulated F-actin dynamics to organize the appressorium pore and facilitate entry of the fungus into host tissue.
27990152	Transcriptional Profiling of Rice Treated with MoHrip1 Reveal the Function of Protein Elicitor in Enhancement of Disease Resistance and Plant Growth.	2016	Front Plant Sci	MoHrip1 is a protein elicitor isolated from Magnaporthe oryzae and was found to induce blast-resistance in rice. To investigate the comprehensive functions of MoHrip1, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed to collect the transcriptional data of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by MoHrip1. A total of 308 genes were identified with differential expression, and 80 genes were predicted to be induced specifically by MoHrip1. Among these 308 genes, a series of genes associated with the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, phytoalexin, transcription factors, and pathogen-related proteins were identified. Both the SA signaling pathway and the gibberellin (GA) pathway were activated, while the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway was repressed. The contents of endogenous SA and GA and the morphological characteristics of the rice after treatment were measured to provide evidence supporting the predictions made based on the DGE data. The 80 genes mentioned above might be candidate genes for studying interactions with MoHrip1. The transcriptional data provided global effect information in rice induced by MoHrip1, and all the results demonstrated that MoHrip1 could induce pathogen resistance and promote plant growth by regulating the contents of SA and GA directly or indirectly.
28025977	Origins of rice cytoplasmic male sterility genes.	2017	Cell Res	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) factors have long been known in some wild plants, and also in some domesticated species, where they are used to produce plants to be used as maternal parents, for example to breed hybrids that display hybrid vigor. Their origins have been mystifying, and now a study recently published in Cell Research helps understand how one widely-used rice CMS factor evolved.
28025485	Overexpression of AmRosea1 Gene Confers Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Ectopic expression of the MYB transcription factor of AmROSEA1 from Antirrhinum majus has been reported to change anthocyanin and other metabolites in several species. In this study, we found that overexpression of AmRosea1 significantly improved the tolerance of transgenic rice to drought and salinity stresses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a considerable number of stress-related genes were affected by exogenous AmRosea1 during both drought and salinity stress treatments. These affected genes are involved in stress signal transduction, the hormone signal pathway, ion homeostasis and the enzymes that remove peroxides. This work suggests that the AmRosea1 gene is a potential candidate for genetic engineering of crops.
27959949	Chinese Milk Vetch as Green Manure Mitigates Nitrous Oxide Emission from Monocropped Rice System in South China.	2016	PLoS One	Monocropped rice system is an important intensive cropping system for food security in China. Green manure (GM) as an alternative to fertilizer N (FN) is useful for improving soil quality. However, few studies have examined the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) as GM on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from monocropped rice field in south China. Therefore, a pot-culture experiment with four treatments (control, no FN and CMV; CMV as GM alone, M; fertilizer N alone, FN; integrating fertilizer N with CMV, NM) was performed to investigate the effect of incorporating CMV as GM on N2O emission using a closed chamber-gas chromatography (GC) technique during the rice growing periods. Under the same N rate, incorporating CMV as GM (the treatments of M and NM) mitigated N2O emission during the growing periods of rice plant, reduced the NO3- content and activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase as well as the population of nitrifying bacteria in top soil at maturity stage of rice plant versus FN pots. The global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of N2O from monocropped rice field was ranked as M<NM<FN. However, the treatment of NM increased rice grain yield and soil NH4+ content, which were dramatically decreased in the M pots, over the treatment of FN. Hence, it can be concluded that integrating FN with CMV as GM is a feasible tactic for food security and N2O mitigation in the monocropped rice based system.

27994188	Marker-assisted improvement of the elite restorer line of rice, RPHR-1005 for resistance against bacterial blight and blast diseases.	2016	J Genet	This study was carried out to improve the RPHR-1005, a stable restorer line of the popular medium slender grain type rice hybrid, DRRH-3 for bacterial blight (BB) and blast resistance through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Two major BB resistance genes, Xa21 and Xa33 and a major blast resistance gene, Pi2 were transferred to RPHR-1005 as two individual crosses. Foreground selection for Xa21, Xa33, Pi2, Rf3 and Rf4 was done by using gene-specific functional markers, while 59 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers polymorphic between the donors and recipient parents were used to select the best plant possessing target resistance genes at each backcross generation. Backcrossing was continued till BC2F2 and a promising homozygous backcross derived line possessing Xa21+ Pi2 and another possessing Xa33 were intercrossed to stack the target resistance genes into the genetic background of RPHR-1005. At ICF4, 10 promising lines possessing three resistance genes in homozygous condition along with fine-grain type, complete fertility restoration, better panicle exertion and taller plant type (compared to RPHR-1005) were identified.

27976810	Jasmonic acid-mediated defense suppresses brassinosteroid-mediated susceptibility to Rice black streaked dwarf virus infection in rice.	2017	New Phytol	Plant hormones play a vital role in plant immune responses. However, in contrast to the relative wealth of information on hormone-mediated immunity in dicot plants, little information is available on monocot-virus defense systems. We used a high-throughput-sequencing approach to compare the global gene expression of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV)-infected rice plants with that of healthy plants. Exogenous hormone applications and transgenic rice were used to test RBSDV infectivity and pathogenicity. Our results revealed that the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway was induced while the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway was suppressed in infected plants. Foliar application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or brassinazole (BRZ) resulted in a significant reduction in RBSDV incidence, while epibrassinolide (BL) treatment increased RBSDV infection. Infection studies using coi1-13 and Go mutants demonstrated JA-mediated resistance and BR-mediated susceptibility to RBSDV infection. A mixture of MeJA and BL treatment resulted in a significant reduction in RBSDV infection compared with a single BL treatment. MeJA application efficiently suppressed the expression of BR pathway genes, and this inhibition depended on the JA coreceptor OsCOI1. Collectively, our results reveal that JA-mediated defense can suppress the BR-mediated susceptibility to RBSDV infection.
27905529	Efficient targeted mutagenesis of rice and tobacco genomes using Cpf1 from Francisella novicida.	2016	Sci Rep	CRISPR/Cas9 systems are nowadays applied extensively to effect genome editing in various organisms including plants. CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1) is a newly characterized RNA-guided endonuclease that has two distinct features as compared to Cas9. First, Cpf1 utilizes a thymidine-rich protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) while Cas9 prefers a guanidine-rich PAM. Cpf1 could be used as a sequence-specific nuclease to target AT-rich regions of a genome that Cas9 had difficulty accessing. Second, Cpf1 generates DNA ends with a 5' overhang, whereas Cas9 creates blunt DNA ends after cleavage. "Sticky" DNA ends should increase the efficiency of insertion of a desired DNA fragment into the Cpf1-cleaved site using complementary DNA ends. Therefore, Cpf1 could be a potent tool for precise genome engineering. To evaluate whether Cpf1 can be applied to plant genome editing, we selected Cpf1 from Francisella novicida (FnCpf1), which recognizes a shorter PAM (TTN) within known Cpf1 proteins, and applied it to targeted mutagenesis in tobacco and rice. Our results show that targeted mutagenesis had occurred in transgenic plants expressing FnCpf1 with crRNA. Deletions of the targeted region were the most frequently observed mutations. Our results demonstrate that FnCpf1 can be applied successfully to genome engineering in plants.
27929052	Effects of nitrogen and biochar amendment on soil methane concentration profiles and diffusion in a rice-wheat annual rotation system.	2016	Sci Rep	The CH4 emissions from soil were influenced by the changeable CH4 concentrations and diffusions in soil profiles, but that have been subjected to nitrogen (N) and biochar amendment over seasonal and annual time frames. Accordingly, a two-year field experiment was conducted in southeastern China to determine the amendment effects on CH4 concentrations and diffusive effluxes as measured by a multilevel sampling probe in paddy soil during two cycles of rice-wheat rotations. The results showed that the top 7-cm soil layers were the primary CH4 production sites during the rice-growing seasons. This layer acted as the source of CH4 generation and diffusion, and the deeper soil layers and the wheat season soil acted as the sink. N fertilization significantly increased the CH4 concentration and diffusive effluxes in the top 7-cm layers during the 2013 and 2014 rice seasons. Following biochar amendment, the soil CH4 concentrations significantly decreased during the rice season in 2014, relative to the single N treatment. Moreover, 40 t ha-1 biochar significantly decreased the diffusive effluxes during the rice seasons in both years. Therefore, our results showed that biochar amendment is a good strategy for reducing the soil profile CH4 concentrations and diffusive effluxes induced by N in paddy fields.
27925226	Leaf gas films contribute to rice (Oryza sativa) submergence tolerance during saline floods.	2016	Plant Cell Environ	Floods and salinization of agricultural land adversely impact global rice production. We investigated whether gas films on leaves of submerged rice delay salt entry during saline submergence. Two-week-old plants with leaf gas films (+GF) or with gas films experimentally removed (-GF) were submerged in artificial floodwater with 0 or 50 mm NaCl for up to 16 d. Gas films were present >9 d on GF plants after which gas films were diminished. Tissue ion analysis (Na+ , Cl- and K+ ) showed that gas films caused some delay of Na+ entry, as leaf Na+ concentration was 36-42% higher in -GF leaves than +GF leaves on days 1-5. However, significant net uptakes of Na+ and Cl- , and K+ net loss, occurred despite the presence of gas films, indicating the likely presence of some leaf-to-floodwater contact, so that the gas layer must not have completely separated the leaf surfaces from the water. Natural loss and removal of gas films resulted in severe declines in growth, underwater photosynthesis, chlorophylla and tissue porosity. Submergence was more detrimental to leaf PN and growth than the additional effect of 50 mm NaCl, as salt did not significantly affect underwater PN at 200 μm CO2 nor growth.
28012016	The ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (OsFd-GOGAT) participates in leaf senescence and the nitrogen remobilization in rice.	2017	Mol Genet Genomics	Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1) plays major roles in photorespiration and primary nitrogen assimilation. However, due to no mutant or knockdown lines of OsFd-GOGAT have been reported in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the contribution of OsFd-GOGAT to rice foliar nitrogen metabolism remains little up-to-date. Here, we isolated a rice premature leaf senescence mutant named gogat1, which was reduced in 67% of the total GOGAT enzyme activity in leaves. The gogat1 mutant exhibited chlorosis under natural condition, while showed less extent premature leaf senescence under low light treatment. The gogat1 locus was mapped to a 54.1 kb region on chromosome 7, and the sequencing of OsFd-GOGAT showed one substitution (A to T) at the 3017th nucleotide of the open reading frame, leading to the amino-acid substitution of leucine changed to histidine. The gogat1 mutant showed reduced seed setting rate, while the grain protein content in gogat1 mutant was significantly higher than that in wild type. Meanwhile, during the grain-filling stage, total amino acids in the up three leaves and the upmost internode were increased dramatically. The results in this study suggested that OsFd-GOGAT might participate in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence, which provides a potential way to improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice.
27917941	Comparative phylogenomic analysis provides insights into TCP gene functions in Sorghum.	2016	Sci Rep	Sorghum is a highly efficient C4 crop with potential to mitigate challenges associated with food, feed and fuel. TCP proteins are of particular interest for crop improvement programs due to their well-demonstrated roles in crop domestication and shaping plant architecture thereby, affecting agronomic traits. We identified 20 TCP genes from Sorghum. Except SbTCP8, all are either intronless or contain introns in the untranslated regions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and Sorghum TCP proteins revealed two distinct classes categorized into ten sub-clades. Sub-clade F is dicot-specific, whereas A2, G1 and I1 groups only contained genes from grasses. Sub-clade B was missing in Sorghum, whereas group A1 was missing in rice indicating species-specific divergence of TCP proteins. TCP proteins of Sorghum are enriched in disorder promoting residues with class I containing higher percent disorder than class II proteins. Seven pairs of paralogous TCP genes were identified from Sorghum, five of which seem to predate Rice-Sorghum divergence. All of them have diverged in their expression. Based on the expression and orthology analysis, five Sorghum genes have been shortlisted for further investigation for their roles in regulating plant morphology. Whereas, three genes have been identified as candidates for engineering abiotic stress tolerance.
28066479	SWATH-MS Quantitative Analysis of Proteins in the Rice Inferior and Superior Spikelets during Grain Filling.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Modern rice cultivars have large panicle but their yield potential is often not fully achieved due to poor grain-filling of late-flowering inferior spikelets (IS). Our earlier work suggested a broad transcriptional reprogramming during grain filling and showed a difference in gene expression between IS and earlier-flowering superior spikelets (SS). However, the links between the abundances of transcripts and their corresponding proteins are unclear. In this study, a SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry) -based quantitative proteomic analysis has been applied to investigate SS and IS proteomes. A total of 304 proteins of widely differing functionality were observed to be differentially expressed between IS and SS. Detailed gene ontology analysis indicated that several biological processes including photosynthesis, protein metabolism, and energy metabolism are differentially regulated. Further correlation analysis revealed that abundances of most of the differentially expressed proteins are not correlated to the respective transcript levels, indicating that an extra layer of gene regulation which may exist during rice grain filling. Our findings raised an intriguing possibility that these candidate proteins may be crucial in determining the poor grain-filling of IS. Therefore, we hypothesize that the regulation of proteome changes not only occurs at the transcriptional, but also at the post-transcriptional level, during grain filling in rice.
27941309	Gene interaction at seed-awning loci in the genetic background of wild rice.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	Seed awning is one of the important traits for successful propagation in wild rice. During the domestication of rice by ancient humans, plants with awnless seeds may have been selected because long awns hindered collection and handling activities. To investigate domestication of awnless rice, QTL analysis for seed awning was first carried out using backcross recombinant inbred lines between Oryza sativa Nipponbare (recurrent parent) and O. rufipogon W630 (donor parent). Two strong QTLs were detected in the same regions as known major seed-awning loci, An-1 and RAE2. Subsequent causal mutation surveying and fine mapping confirmed that O. rufipogon W630 has functional alleles at both loci. The gene effects and interactions at these loci were examined using two backcross populations with reciprocal genetic backgrounds of O. sativa Nipponbare and O. rufipogon W630. As awn length in wild rice varied among seeds even in the same plant, awn length was measured based on spikelet position. In the genetic background of cultivated rice, the wild alleles at An-1 and RAE2 had awning effects, and plants having both wild homozygous alleles produced awns whose length was about 70% of those of the wild parent. On the other hand, in the genetic background of wild rice, the substitution of cultivated alleles at An-1 and RAE2 contributed little to awn length reduction. These results indicate that the domestication process of awnless seeds was complicated because many genes are involved in awn formation in wild rice.
28006731	Selenite modulates the level of phenolics and nutrient element to alleviate the toxicity of arsenite in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Arsenic (As) contamination of paddy rice is a serious threat all over the world particularly in South East Asia. Selenium (Se) plays important role in protection of plants against various abiotic stresses including heavy metals. Moreover, arsenite (AsIII) and selenite (SeIV) can be biologically antagonistic due to similar electronic configuration and sharing the common transporter for their uptake in plant. In the present study, the response of oxidative stress, phenolic compounds and nutrient elements was analyzed to investigate Se mediated As tolerance in rice seedlings during AsIII and SeIV exposure in hydroponics. Selenite (25µM) significantly decreased As accumulation in plant than As (25µM) alone treated plants. Level of oxidative stress related parameters viz., reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, electrical conductivity, nitric oxide and pro-oxidant enzyme (NADPH oxidase), were in the order of As>As+Se>control>Se. Selenium ameliorated As phytotoxicity by increased level of phenolic compounds particularly gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid and rutin and thiol metabolism related enzymes viz., serine acetyl transferase (SAT) and cysteine synthase (CS). Selenium supplementation enhanced the uptake of nutrient elements viz., Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, and improved plant growth. The results concluded that Se addition in As contaminated environment might be an important strategy to reduce As uptake and associated phytotoxicity in rice plant by modulation of phenolic compounds and increased uptake of nutrient elements.
28003004	Defense Against Pathogens: Structural Insights into the Mechanism of Chitin Induced Activation of Innate Immunity.	2017	Curr Med Chem	Pattern recognition receptors on the plant cell surface mediate the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns, in a process which activates downstream immune signaling. These receptors are plasma membrane-localized kinases which need to be autophosphorylated to activate downstream responses. Perception of attacks from fungi occurs through recognition of chitin, a polymer of an N-acetylglucosamine which is a characteristic component of the cell walls of fungi. This process is regulated in Arabidopsis by chitin elicitor receptor kinase CERK1. A more complex process characterizes rice, in which regulation of chitin perception is operated by a complex composed of OsCERK1, a homolog of CERK1, and the chitin elicitor binding protein OsCEBiP. Recent literature has provided a mechanistic description of the complex regulation of activation of innate immunity in rice and an advance in the structural description of molecular players involved in this process. This review describes the current status of the understanding of molecular events involved in innate immunity activation in rice.
27999987	Mapping and application of the twin-grain1 gene in rice.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The map-based cloning and application of a flower organ number gene twin - grain1 provide great potential for improving seed production in hybrid rice. A new germplasm for high-yield rice breeding, the twin-grain1 (tg1) mutant with more than one grain in a glume, was obtained from the Zhejing 22 rice variety via physical mutagenesis. The mapping results showed that TG1 is allelic to FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2)/FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), a flower organ number gene located at 88.7 cM on chromosome 11. The novel tg1 gene allele was introgressed into the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) line Zhejing 22A, giving rise to a new CMS line Zhejing 22-tg1A. The Zhejing 22-tg1A line showed enhanced glume opening and stigma exsertion, which increased the outcrossing rate in hybrid rice. A small-scale hybrid rice seed production test demonstrated that the grain yield of the Zhejing 22-tg1A/Zhejinghui 5 line was significantly increased compared to that of the Zhejing 22A/Zhejinghui 5 line. The plot yield evaluation of the F1 hybrid lines showed a higher yield for the Zhejing 22-tg1A/Zhejinghui 5 line than that of the Zhejing 22A/Zhejinghui 5 line. The results implied great potentials for the tg1 gene in hybrid rice breeding.
28028608	Accumulation of foreign polypeptides to rice seed protein body type I using prolamin portion sequences.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Rice prolamins are accumulated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived proteins bodies, although conserved sequences retained in ER are not confirmed. We investigated portion sequences of prolamins that must accumulate in PB-Is. Rice seed prolamins are accumulated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived protein body type I (PB-I), but ER retention sequences in rice prolamin polypeptides have not been confirmed. Here we investigated the lengths of the prolamin portion sequences required for accumulation in PB-Is. Of the rice prolamins, we compared 13a and 13b prolamins because the amino acid sequences of these prolamins are quite similar except for the presence or absence of Cys-residues. We also generated and analyzed transgenic rice expressing several prolamin portion sequence-GFP fusion proteins. We observed that in 13a prolamin, when the portion sequences were extended more than the 68th amino acid residue from the initiating methionine, the prolamin portion sequence-GFP fusion proteins were accumulated in PB-Is. In 13b prolamin, when the portion sequences were extended by more than the 82nd amino acid residue from the initiating methionine, the prolamin portion sequence-GFP fusion proteins were accumulated in PB-Is. When those fusion proteins were extracted under non-reduced or reduced conditions, the 13a prolamin portion sequence-GFP fusion proteins in PB-Is were soluble under only the reduced condition. In contrast, 13b prolamin portion sequence-GFP fusion proteins were soluble under both non-reduced and reduced conditions. These results suggest that the accumulation of 13a prolamin in PB-Is is associated with the formation of disulfide bonds and/or hydrophobicity in 13a prolamin polypeptide, whereas the accumulation of 13b prolamin in PB-Is was less involved in the formation of disulfide bonds.
28005988	HvDep1 Is a Positive Regulator of Culm Elongation and Grain Size in Barley and Impacts Yield in an Environment-Dependent Manner.	2016	PLoS One	Heterotrimeric G proteins are intracellular membrane-attached signal transducers involved in various cellular processes in both plants and animals. They consist of three subunits denoted as α, β and γ. The γ-subunits of the so-called AGG3 type, which comprise a transmembrane domain, are exclusively found in plants. In model species, these proteins have been shown to participate in the control of plant height, branching and seed size and could therefore impact the harvestable yield of various crop plants. Whether AGG3-type γ-subunits influence yield in temperate cereals like barley and wheat remains unknown. Using a transgenic complementation approach, we show here that the Scottish malting barley cultivar (cv.) Golden Promise carries a loss-of-function mutation in HvDep1, an AGG3-type subunit encoding gene that positively regulates culm elongation and seed size in barley. Somewhat intriguingly, agronomic field data collected over a 12-year period reveals that the HvDep1 loss-of-function mutation in cv. Golden Promise has the potential to confer either a significant increase or decrease in harvestable yield depending on the environment. Our results confirm the role of AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes in shaping plant architecture, but interestingly also indicate that the impact HvDep1 has on yield in barley is both genotypically and environmentally sensitive. This may explain why widespread exploitation of variation in AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes has not occurred in temperate cereals while in rice the DEP1 locus is widely exploited to improve harvestable yield.
27918246	Rice Leaf Transcriptional Profiling Suggests a Functional Interplay Between Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Lipopolysaccharide and Extracellular Polysaccharide in Modulation of Defense Responses During Infection.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Treatment of rice leaves with isolated Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the production of callose deposits, reactive oxygen species, and enhanced resistance against subsequent bacterial infection. Expression profiling of X. oryzae pv. oryzae LPS-treated rice (Oryza sativa subsp. indica) leaves showed that genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways for lignins, phenylpropanoids, chorismate, phenylalanine, salicylic acid, and ethylene, as well as a number of pathogenesis-related proteins are up-regulated. Gene ontology categories like cell-wall organization, defense response, stress response, and protein phosphorylation/kinases were found to be upregulated, while genes involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated. Coinfiltration with xanthan gum, the xanthomonas extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), suppressed LPS-induced callose deposition. Gene expression analysis of rice leaves that are treated with an EPS-deficient mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae indicated that a number of defense-regulated functions are up-regulated during infection. These transcriptional responses are attenuated in rice leaves treated with an EPS-deficient mutant that is also deficient in the O-antigen component of LPS. Overall, these results suggest that the O-antigen component of X. oryzae pv. oryzae LPS induces rice defense responses during infection and that these are suppressed by bacterial EPS.
27990555	Root-associated bacterial diversities of Oryza rufipogon and Oryza sativa and their influencing environmental factors.	2017	Arch Microbiol	Oryza rufipogon is the ancestor of human-cultivated Oryza sativa. However, little is known about the difference between the root-associated microorganisms of O. rufipogon and O. sativa. In this study, the root-associated bacteria of O. rufipogon, Leersia hexandra, and O. sativa from different latitudes in China were studied by DGGE analysis. Their bacterial community structures were compared by principal component analysis. The relationship between root-associated bacteria and soil properties was explored by canonical correspondence analysis. The relationships of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) content, soluble sugar content, proline content of the plant, and bacterial diversity indices of their root-associated microorganisms were also investigated. We found both broad-spectrum and host-specific bacteria, and the similarity, diversity and abundance indices of O. rufipogon and L. hexandra were higher than O. sativa root-associated bacteria. However, even living in the same habitat, O. rufipogon and L. hexandra selected different root-associated bacteria. Microbial composition was primarily correlated with available N, P, and K and the annual precipitation. We also found a positive correlation between the soluble sugar content of the plant and GRSP content of the root soil. The above results indicated that the community structure of root-associated bacteria differs between wild rice and cultivated rice. Human activity and the natural selection of the host plants shaped the differences, consistent with our hypothesis.
28027007	Multiple roles of nitric oxide in root development and nitrogen uptake.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Nitric oxide (NO) is widely recognized for its role as a signaling molecule in regulating plant developmental processes. We summarize recent work on NO generation via nitrate reductase (NR) or/and NO synthase (NOS) pathway in response to nutrient fluctuation and its regulation of plant root growth and N metabolism. The promotion or inhibition of root development most likely depends on NO concentrations and/or experimental conditions. NO plays an important role in regulating plant NR activity at posttranslational level probably via a direct interaction mechanism, thus contributing largely to N assimilation. NO also regulates N distribution and uptake in many plant species. In rice cultivar, NR-generated NO plays a pivotal role in improving N uptake capacity by increasing root growth and inorganic N uptake, representing a potential strategy for rice adaption to a fluctuating nitrate supply.
27999965	Genotypic-dependent effects of N fertilizer, glutathione, silicon, zinc, and selenium on proteomic profiles, amino acid contents, and quality of rice genotypes with contrasting grain Cd accumulation.	2017	Funct Integr Genomics	Soil heavy metal (HM) contamination has posed a serious problem for safe food production. For restricting the translocation of HM into grain, many proteins were regulated to involve in the process. To identify these proteins, 2D-based proteomic analysis was carried out using different rice genotypes with distinct Cd accumulation in grains and as affected by an alleviating regulator (AR) in field experiments. AR application improved grain quality, with increased contents in Glu, Cys, His, Pro, and protein. Twenty-six low-grain HM accumulation-associated protein species were identified and categorized as physiological functions via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, 8, 9, and 9 proteins exhibited higher accumulation, lower accumulation, and unchanged accumulation, respectively, in Xiushui817 (low accumulator) vs R8097 (high accumulator) under control conditions but showed differential accumulation patterns after AR application. These proteins included sucrose synthase 3, alanine aminotransferase, glutelin, cupin family protein, and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 32. The differential expression of these protein species might contribute to decreased HM accumulation in grain via decreasing the protein accumulation which had high affinity to HM or regulating energy metabolism and signal transduction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of low-grain HM accumulation in rice and possible utilization of candidate protein species in developing low-grain HM accumulation genotypes.

Their functions remain as yet largely unknown. Mining potential stress responsive PPRs, and checking whether known PPR editing factors are affected in the stress treatments. It is beneficial to elucidate the regulation mechanism of PPRs involved in biotic and abiotic stress. Here, we explored the characteristics and origin of the 105 E subgroup PPRs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis categorized the E subgroup PPRs into five discrete groups (Cluster I to V), and they may have a common origin in both A. thaliana and rice. An in silico expression analysis of the 105 E subgroup PPRs in A. thaliana was performed using available microarray data. Thirty-four PPRs were differentially expressed during A. thaliana seed imbibition, seed development stage(s), and flowers development processes. To explore potential stress responsive PPRs, differential expression of 92 PPRs was observed in A. thaliana seedlings subjected to different abiotic stresses. qPCR data of E subgroup PPRs under stress conditions revealed that the expression of 5 PPRs was responsive to abiotic stresses. In addition, PPR96 is involved in plant responses to salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and oxidative stress. The T-DNA insertion mutation inactivating PPR96 expression results in plant insensitivity to salt, ABA, and oxidative stress. The PPR96 protein is localized in the mitochondria, and altered transcription levels of several stress-responsive genes under abiotic stress treatments. Our results suggest that PPR96 may important function in a role connecting the regulation of oxidative respiration and environmental responses in A. thaliana.
28025342	RiceATM: a platform for identifying the association between rice agronomic traits and miRNA expression.	2016	Database (Oxford)	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play critical roles in plant development and stress-response regulation, and they frequently display multi-targeting characteristics. The control of defined rice phenotypes occurs through multiple genes; however, evidence demonstrating the relationship between agronomic traits and miRNA expression profiles is lacking. In this study, we investigated eight yield-related traits in 187 local rice cultivars and profiled the expression levels of 193 miRNAs in these cultivars using microarray analyses. By integrating the miRBase database, the rice annotation project database, and the miRanda and psRNATarget web servers, we constructed a database (RiceATM) that can be employed to investigate the association between rice agronomic traits and miRNA expression. The functions of this platform include phenotype selection, sample grouping, microarray data pretreatment, statistical analysis and target gene predictions. To demonstrate the utility of RiceATM, we used the database to identify four miRNAs associated with the heading date and validated their expression trends in the cultivars with early or late heading date by real-time PCR. RiceATM is a useful tool for researchers seeking to characterize the role of certain miRNAs for a specific phenotype and discover potential biomarkers for breeding or functional studies.Database URL: http://syslab3.nchu.edu.tw/rice/.
27580728	Deposition mode of transforming growth factor-β expressed in transgenic rice seed.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Mouse TGF-β highly accumulated by expressing as a secretory homodimeric protein in transgenic rice endosperm. It was tightly deposited in ER-derived PBs by interaction with cysteine-rich prolamins. TGF-β is one of the key players involved in the induction and maintenance of mucosal immune tolerance to dietary proteins through the induction of regulatory T cells. In order to utilize rice-based TGF-β as a tool to promote oral immune tolerance induction, high production of TGF-β is essentially required. When the codon-optimized mTGF-β was expressed as a secretory protein by ligating an N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal KDEL ER retention signal under the control of the endosperm-specific rice storage protein glutelin GluB-1 promoter, accumulation level was low in stable transgenic rice seeds. Then, to increase the accumulation level of mTGF-β, it was expressed as fusion proteins by inserting into the C terminus of acidic subunit of glutelin GluA and the variable region of 26 kDa globulin. When fused with the glutelin, it could accumulate well as visible bands by CBB staining gel, but not for the 26 kDa globulin. Unexpectedly, expression of homodimeric mTGF-β linked by a 6×Gly1×Ser linker as secretory protein resulted in higher level of accumulation. This expression level was further enhanced by reduction of some endogenous prolamins by RNA interference. The monomeric and dimeric mTGF-βs were deposited in ER-derived PBs containing prolamins. When highly produced in rice seed, it is notable that most of ER-derived PBs were distorted and granulated. Step-wise extraction of storage proteins from rice seeds suggested that the mTGF-β strongly interacted with cysteine-rich prolamins via disulfide bonds. This result was also supported by the finding that reducing agent was absolutely required for mTGF-β extraction.

27957808	GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 2 regulates grain filling and starch synthesis during rice caryopsis development.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Rice grain filling determines grain weight, final yield and grain quality. Here, a rice defective grain filling mutant, gif2, was identified. Grains of gif2 showed a slower filling rate and a significant lower final grain weight and yield compared to wild-type. The starch content in gif2 was noticeably decreased and its physicochemical properties were also altered. Moreover, gif2 endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound granule formation. Positional cloning identified GIF2 to encode an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) large subunit, AGPL2; consequently, AGP enzyme activity in gif2 endosperms was remarkably decreased. GIF2 is mainly expressed in developing grains and the coded protein localizes in the cytosol. Yeast two hybrid assay showed that GIF2 interacted with AGP small subunits OsAGPS1, OsAGPS2a and OsAGPS2b. Transcript levels for granule-bound starch synthase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme and starch debranching enzyme were distinctly elevated in gif2 grains. In addition, the level of nucleotide diversity of the GIF2 locus was extremely low in both cultivated and wild rice. All of these results suggest that GIF2 plays important roles in the regulation of grain filling and starch biosynthesis during caryopsis development, and that it has been preserved during selection throughout domestication of modern rice.
28013273	CATchUP: A Web Database for Spatiotemporally Regulated Genes.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	For proper control of biological activity, some key genes are highly expressed in a particular spatiotemporal domain. Mining of such spatiotemporally expressed genes using large-scale gene expression data derived from a broad range of experimental sources facilitates our understanding of genome-scale functional gene networks. However, comprehensive information on spatiotemporally expressed genes is lacking in plants. To collect such information, we devised a new index, Δdmax, which is the maximum difference in relative gene expression levels between sample runs which are neighboring when sorted by the levels. Employing this index, we comprehensively evaluated transcripts using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data stored in the Sequence Read Archive for eight plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), Solanum tuberosum (potato), Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), Vitis vinifera (grape), Medicago truncatula (Medicago), and Glycine max (soybean). Based on the frequency distribution of the Δdmax values, approximately 70,000 transcripts showing 0.3 or larger Δdmax values were extracted for the eight species. Information on these genes including the Δdmax values, functional annotations, conservation among species, and experimental conditions where the genes show high expression levels is provided in a new database, CATchUP (http://plantomics.mind.meiji.ac.jp/CATchUP). The CATchUP database assists in identifying genes specifically expressed under particular conditions with powerful search functions and an intuitive graphical user interface.
28008850	Pathogen effectors and plant immunity determine specialization of the blast fungus to rice subspecies.	2016	Elife	Understanding how fungi specialize on their plant host is crucial for developing sustainable disease control. A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzaeh play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies. Our results have indicated that major differences in several components of basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity of the japonica and indica rice varieties are associated with specialization of M. oryzae. These differences thus play a key role in determining M. oryzae host specificity and may limit the spread of the pathogen within the Yuanyang agro-system. Specifically, the AVR-Pia effector has been identified as a possible determinant of the specialization of M. oryzae to local japonica rice.
28013174	Dwarf and short grain 1, encoding a putative U-box protein regulates cell division and elongation in rice.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Plant hormones coordinate a plant's responses to environmental stimuli and the endogenous developmental programs for cell division and elongation. Brassinosteroids are among the most important of these hormones in plant development. Recently, the ubiquitin-26S-proteasome system was identified to play a key role in hormone biology. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, DSG1, which encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the dsg1 mutant (an allelic mutant of tud1), the lengths of the roots, internodes, panicles, and seeds were shorter than that in the wild-type, which was due to defects in cell division and elongation. In addition, the leaves of the dsg1 mutant were wider and curled. The DSG1 protein is nuclear- and cytoplasm-localized and does not show tissue specificity in terms of its expression, which occurs in roots, culms, leaves, sheaths, and spikelets. The dsg1 mutant is less sensitive to brassinosteroid treatment than the wild-type, and DSG1 expression is negatively regulated by brassinosteroids, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid. These results demonstrate that DSG1 positively regulates cell division and elongation and may be involved in multiple hormone pathways.
28066455	Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Studies Disclose Key Metabolism Pathways Contributing to Well-maintained Photosynthesis under the Drought and the Consequent Drought-Tolerance in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	In contrast to wild species, drought-tolerance in crops requires a fully functional metabolism during drought (particularly photosynthetic processes). However, the link between drought-tolerance, photosynthetic regulation during drought, and the associated transcript and metabolic foundation, remains largely unknown. For this study, we used two rice cultivars with contrasting drought-tolerance (the drought-intolerant cultivar IRAT109 and the drought-tolerant cultivar IAC1246) to explore transcript and metabolic responses to long-term drought. The drought-tolerant cultivar represented higher osmotic adjustment and antioxidant capacity, as well as higher relative photosynthesis rate under a progressive drought stress occurred in a modified field with shallow soil-layers. A total of 4059 and 2677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in IRAT109 and IAC1246 between the drought and well-watered conditions, respectively. A total of 69 and 47 differential metabolites (DMs) were identified between the two treatments in IRAT109 and IAC1246, respectively. Compared to IRAT109, the DEGs of IAC1246 displayed enhanced regulatory amplitude during drought. We found significant correlations between DEGs and the osmolality and total antioxidant capacity (AOC) of both cultivars. During the early stages of drought, we detected up-regulation of DEGs in IAC1246 related to photosynthesis, in accordance with its higher relative photosynthesis rate. The contents of six differential metabolites were correlated with the osmotic potential and AOC. Moreover, they were differently regulated between the two cultivars. Particularly, up-regulations of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and ferulic acid were consistent with the performance of photosynthesis-related DEGs at the early stages of drought in IAC1246. Therefore, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and ferulic acid were considered as key metabolites for rice drought-tolerance. DEGs involved in pathways of these metabolites are expected to be good candidate genes to improve drought-tolerance. In conclusion, well-maintained photosynthesis under drought should contribute to improved drought-tolerance in rice. Metabolites play vital roles in protecting photosynthesis under dehydration via osmotic adjustments and/or antioxidant mechanisms. A metabolite-based method was thus an effective way to explore drought candidate genes. Metabolic accompanied by transcript responses to drought stress should be further studied to find more useful metabolites, pathways, and genes.
28036378	Characterization and Fine Mapping of a Blast Resistant Gene Pi-jnw1 from the japonica Rice Landrace Jiangnanwan.	2016	PLoS One	Rice blast is a destructive disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, and it has a large impact on rice production worldwide. Compared with leaf blast resistance, our understanding of panicle blast resistance is limited. The japonica landrace Jiangnanwan from Taihu Lake region in China shows highly resistance to panicle and leaf blast. In this study, three generations (F2:5, F2:6, F2:7) consisting of 221 RILs (recombination inbreeding lines), developed from the cross of Jiangnanwan and Suyunuo, a susceptible-blast japonica variety, were evaluated for panicle blast resistance in the fields and leaf blast resistance in greenhouse in Nanjing in 2013, 2014 and 2015. A blast resistance gene Pi-jnw1 referring to panicle blast resistance and leaf blast resistance was identified in the three generations and located in the region of RM27273 and RM27381 in chromosome 11. The RIL18 line harboring Pi-jnw1 was selected to be backcrossed with Suyunuo to develop BC2F2 populations. According to the genotyping of 1,150 BC2F2 individuals and panicle blast and leaf blast resistance evaluation of 47 recombinants between RM27150 and RM27381, Pi-jnw1 was finally mapped to the 282 kb region between markers W28 and BS39. This study revealed that Jiangnanwan harboring a panicle blast and leaf blast resistance gene Pi-jnw1 could be a genetic source for breeding new rice cultivars with panicle blast resistance.
27976484	High-Throughput Screening of Catalytic H<sub>2</sub> Production.	2017	Angew Chem Int Ed Engl	Hydrogenases, ferredoxins, and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases (FNR) are redox proteins that mediate electron metabolism in vivo, and are also potential components for biological H2 production technologies. A high-throughput H2 production assay device (H2 PAD) is presented that enables simultaneous evaluation of 96 individual H2 production reactions to identify components that improve performance. Using a CCD camera and image analysis software, H2 PAD senses the chemo-optical response of Pd/WO3 thin films to the H2 produced. H2 PAD-enabled discovery of hydrogenase and FNR mutants that enhance biological H2 production is reported. From a library of 10 080 randomly mutated Clostridium pasteurianum [FeFe] hydrogenases, we found a mutant with nearly 3-fold higher H2 production specific activity. From a library of 400 semi-randomly mutated Oryza sativa FNR, the top hit enabled a 60 % increase in NADPH-driven H2 production rates. H2 PAD can also facilitate elucidation of fundamental biochemical mechanisms within these systems.

28018389	Regulatory Role of <i>OsMADS34</i> in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Grasses produce seeds on spikelets, a unique type of inflorescence. Despite the importance of grass crops for food, the genetic mechanisms that control spikelet development remain poorly understood. In this study, we used m34-z, a new mutant allele of the rice (Oryza sativa) E-class gene OsMADS34, to examine OsMADS34 function in determining the identities of glumes (rudimentary glume and sterile lemma) and grain size. In the m34-z mutant, both the rudimentary glume and sterile lemma were homeotically converted to the lemma-like organ and acquired the lemma identity, suggesting that OsMADS34 plays important roles in the development of glumes. In the m34-z mutant, most of the grains from the secondary panicle branches (spb) were decreased in size, compared with grains from wild-type, but no differences were observed in the grains from the primary panicle branches. The amylose content and gel consistency, and a seed-setting rate from the spb were reduced in the m34-z mutant. Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant. These findings revealed that OsMADS34 largely affects grain yield by affecting the size of grains from the secondary branches.
28058034	Retrospective analysis of the effects of a highly standardized mixture of <i>Berberis aristata</i>, <i>Silybum marianum</i>, and monacolins K and KA in patients with dyslipidemia.	2017	Clin Pharmacol	BACKGROUND: Berberis aristata, because of its berberine content, and Monascus purpureus fermented rice, because of the presence of monacolins (naturally derived statins), are widely investigated food-grade ingredients used to formulate cholesterol-lowering supplements. Although they are extensively used, berberine is poorly absorbed and monacolins are poorly chemically characterized, not standardized, and possibly contaminated with toxic compounds. Silymarin is reported to enhance berberine absorption, while Monakopure™-K20 (MK-20) is a highly standardized red yeast rice containing monacolins K and KA in the ratio of 1:1 but not secondary monacolins, dehydromonacolins, or citrinin.

AIM: The effects of a cholesterol-lowering supplement (Berberol®K) containing berberine, silymarin, and MK-20 (BSM) in patients with dyslipidemia were clinically analyzed.

METHODS: The clinical role of BSM in naïve and in statin-intolerant patients was retrospectively evaluated and the effects observed were compared with those obtained in patients without treatment or treated with lovastatin.

RESULTS: Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels were approximately 4%, 6%, and 11% lower, respectively, and the creatine phosphokinase increase was reduced in patients treated with BSM compared to those treated with lovastatin. Similar results were also obtained in statin-intolerant subjects where BSM was administered as add-on therapy to ezetimibe or fenofibrate.

CONCLUSION: BSM is a food supplement potentially useful 1) as a primary intervention in low-cardiovascular-risk subjects with dyslipidemia; 2) as add-on therapy in mildly statin-intolerant patients; and 3) in dyslipidemic patients with a negative perception of statins who prefer a treatment seen as natural.
27943653	Cross-resistance to three phenylpyrazole insecticides and A2'N mutation detection of GABA receptor subunit in fipronil-resistant Laodelphax striatellus (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) is an important pest of crops in East Asia. Over the past decade, phenylpyrazole insecticides, which target the insect GABA receptor, have increasingly been used as alternatives against rice planthoppers.

RESULTS: Cross-resistance to ethiprole and butene-fipronil was detected in a laboratory-selected fipronil-resistant strain of L. striatellus (LsFR). Compared with a fipronil-susceptible strain (LsFS), LsFR had obtained a high-level resistance to fipronil (112.1-fold) and moderate resistance to ethiprole (24.5-fold) and butene-fipronil (14.7-fold). For the resistance of field populations, LC50 values of ethiprole were remarkably higher than the other two analogues in Gaochun and Yancheng populations in 2016. Significant correlations were demonstrated between the LC50 values of three phenylpyrazole insecticides (R = 0.944-0.998, P = 0.007-0.016). Additionally, an AS-PCR assay was developed to detect the A2'N mutant GABA receptor in L. striatellus strains or populations. It was noteworthy that mutation frequencies of 19.2 and 3.6% appeared in Lujiang and Gaochun populations in 2016, respectively. Furthermore, there was an extremely significant difference in genomic expression of Lsrdl between the LsFS and LsFR individuals (1.85-fold, F = 26.8, P = 0.0008).

CONCLUSIONS: This study could help us better understand the cross-resistance mechanisms in L. striatellus, and be beneficial for proposing effective pest management strategies of phenylpyrazole resistance. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.
27729434	Little White Lies: Pericarp Color Provides Insights into the Origins and Evolution of Southeast Asian Weedy Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Weedy rice is a conspecific form of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) that infests rice fields and results in severe crop losses. Weed strains in different world regions appear to have originated multiple times from different domesticated and/or wild rice progenitors. In the case of Malaysian weedy rice, a multiple-origin model has been proposed based on neutral markers and analyses of domestication genes for hull color and seed shattering. Here, we examined variation in pericarp (bran) color and its molecular basis to address how this trait evolved in Malaysian weeds and its possible role in weed adaptation. Functional alleles of the Rc gene confer proanthocyanidin pigmentation of the pericarp, a trait found in most wild and weedy Oryzas and associated with seed dormancy; nonfunctional rc alleles were strongly favored during rice domestication, and most cultivated varieties have nonpigmented pericarps. Phenotypic characterizations of 52 Malaysian weeds revealed that most strains are characterized by the pigmented pericarp; however, some weeds have white pericarps, suggesting close relationships to cultivated rice. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Rc haplotypes present in Malaysian weeds likely have at least three distinct origins: wild O. rufipogon, white-pericarp cultivated rice, and red-pericarp cultivated rice. These diverse origins contribute to high Rc nucleotide diversity in the Malaysian weeds. Comparison of Rc allelic distributions with other rice domestication genes suggests that functional Rc alleles may confer particular fitness benefits in weedy rice populations, for example, by conferring seed dormancy. This may promote functional Rc introgression from local wild Oryza populations.
27973585	Impacts of Steel-Slag-Based Silicate Fertilizer on Soil Acidity and Silicon Availability and Metals-Immobilization in a Paddy Soil.	2016	PLoS One	Slag-based silicate fertilizer has been widely used to improve soil silicon- availability and crop productivity. A consecutive early rice-late rice rotation experiment was conducted to test the impacts of steel slag on soil pH, silicon availability, rice growth and metals-immobilization in paddy soil. Our results show that application of slag at a rate above higher or equal to 1 600 mg plant-available SiO2 per kg soil increased soil pH, dry weight of rice straw and grain, plant-available Si concentration and Si concentration in rice shoots compared with the control treatment. No significant accumulation of total cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) was noted in soil; rather, the exchangeable fraction of Cd significantly decreased. The cadmium concentrations in rice grains decreased significantly compared with the control treatment. In conclusion, application of steel slag reduced soil acidity, increased plant-availability of silicon, promoted rice growth and inhibited Cd transport to rice grain in the soil-plant system.
28036107	Linkage drag constrains the roots of modern wheat.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Roots, the hidden half of crop plants, are essential for resource acquisition. However, knowledge about the genetic control of below-ground plant development in wheat, one of the most important small-grain crops in the world, is very limited. The molecular interactions connecting root and shoot development and growth, and thus modulating the plant's demand for water and nutrients along with its ability to access them, are largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that linkage drag in European bread wheat, driven by strong selection for a haplotype variant controlling heading date, has eliminated a specific combination of two flanking, highly conserved haplotype variants whose interaction confers increased root biomass. Reversing this inadvertent consequence of selection could recover root diversity that may prove essential for future food production in fluctuating environments. Highly conserved synteny to rice across this chromosome segment suggests that adaptive selection has shaped the diversity landscape of this locus across different, globally important cereal crops. By mining wheat gene expression data, we identified root-expressed genes within the region of interest that could help breeders to select positive variants adapted to specific target soil environments.
28018384	Allele Mining and Selective Patterns of <i>Pi9</i> Gene in a Set of Rice Landraces from India.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Allelic variants of the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene, Pi9 (nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat region) have been analyzed in Indian rice landraces. They were selected from the list of 338 rice landraces phenotyped in the rice blast nursery at central Rainfed Upland Rice Research Station, Hazaribag. Six of them were further selected on the basis of their resistance and susceptible pattern for virulence analysis and selective pattern study of Pi9 gene. The sequence analysis and phylogenetic study illustrated that such sequences are vastly homologous and clustered into two groups. All the blast resistance Pi9 alleles were grouped into one cluster, whereas Pi9 alleles of susceptible landraces formed another cluster even though these landraces have a low level of DNA polymorphisms. A total number of 136 polymorphic sites comprising of transitions, transversions, and insertion and deletions (InDels) were identified in the 2.9 kb sequence of Pi9 alleles. Lower variation in the form of mutations (77) (Transition + Transversion), and InDels (59) were observed in the Pi9 alleles isolated from rice landraces studied. The results showed that the Pi9 alleles of the selected rice landraces were less variable, suggesting that the rice landraces would have been exposed to less number of pathotypes across the country. The positive Tajima's D (0.33580), P > 0.10 (not significant) was observed among the seven rice landraces, which suggests the balancing selection of Pi9 alleles. The value of synonymous substitution (-0.43337) was less than the non-synonymous substitution (0.78808). The greater non-synonymous substitution than the synonymous means that the coding region, mainly the leucine-rich repeat domain was under diversified selection. In this study, the Pi9 gene has been subjected to balancing selection with low nucleotide diversity which is different from the earlier reports, this may be because of the closeness of the rice landraces, cultivated in the same region, and under low pathotype pressure.
27922088	Analysis of four toxic metals in a single rice seed by matrix solid phase dispersion -inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.	2016	Sci Rep	Toxic metals in rice pose great risks to human health. Metal bioaccumulation in rice grains is a criterion of breeding. Rice breeding requires a sensitive method to determine metal content in single rice grains to assist the variety selection. In the present study, four toxic metals of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) in a single rice grain were determined by a simple and rapid method. The developed method is based on matrix solid phase dispersion using multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as dispersing agent and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The experimental parameters were systematically investigated. The limits of detection (LOD) were 5.0, 0.6, 10 and 2.1 ng g-1 for As, Cd, Cr, and Pb, respectively, with relative standard deviations (n = 6) of <7.7%, demonstrating the good sensitivity and precision of the method. The results of 30 real world rice samples analyzed by this method agreed well with those obtained by the standard microwave digestion. The amount of sample required was reduced approximately 100 fold in comparison with the microwave digestion. The method has a high application potential for other sample matrices and elements with high sensitivity and sample throughput.
27749149	CatB is Critical for Total Catalase Activity and Reduces Bactericidal Effects of Phenazine-1-Carboxylic Acid on Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2017	Phytopathology	Rice bacterial leaf blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and rice bacterial leaf streak, caused by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, are major diseases of rice. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) is a natural product that is isolated from Pseudomonas spp. and is used to control many important rice diseases in China. We previously reported that PCA disturbs the redox balance, which results in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. In this study, we found that PCA significantly upregulated the transcript levels of catB and katE, which encode catalases, and that PCA sensitivity was reduced when X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola were cultured with exogenous catalase. Furthermore, catB deletion mutants of X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola showed dramatically decreased total catalase activity, increased sensitivity to PCA, and reduced virulence in rice. In contrast, deletion mutants of srpA and katG, which also encode catalases, exhibited little change in PCA sensitivity. The results indicate that catB in both X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola encodes a catalase that helps protect the bacteria against PCA-induced stress.
28066483	TCP Transcription Factors at the Interface between Environmental Challenges and the Plant's Growth Responses.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Plants are sessile and as such their reactions to environmental challenges differ from those of mobile organisms. Many adaptions involve growth responses and hence, growth regulation is one of the most crucial biological processes for plant survival and fitness. The plant-specific TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF1 (TCP) transcription factor family is involved in plant development from cradle to grave, i.e., from seed germination throughout vegetative development until the formation of flowers and fruits. TCP transcription factors have an evolutionary conserved role as regulators in a variety of plant species, including orchids, tomatoes, peas, poplar, cotton, rice and the model plant Arabidopsis. Early TCP research focused on the regulatory functions of TCPs in the development of diverse organs via the cell cycle. Later research uncovered that TCP transcription factors are not static developmental regulators but crucial growth regulators that translate diverse endogenous and environmental signals into growth responses best fitted to ensure plant fitness and health. I will recapitulate the research on TCPs in this review focusing on two topics: the discovery of TCPs and the elucidation of their evolutionarily conserved roles across the plant kingdom, and the variety of signals, both endogenous (circadian clock, plant hormones) and environmental (pathogens, light, nutrients), TCPs respond to in the course of their developmental roles.
27959472	Polymer-based oral rehydration solution for treating acute watery diarrhoea.	2016	Cochrane Database Syst Rev	BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoea is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries. Glucose-based oral rehydration solution (ORS) helps replace fluid and prevent further dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Since 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the osmolarity of less than 270 mOsm/L (ORS ≤ 270) versus greater than 310 mOsm/L formulation (ORS ≥ 310). Polymer-based ORS (for example, prepared using rice or wheat) slowly releases glucose and may be superior to glucose-based ORS.

OBJECTIVES: To compare polymer-based oral rehydration solution (polymer-based ORS) with glucose-based oral rehydration solution (glucose-based ORS) for treating acute watery diarrhoea.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following sources up to 5 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 5 September 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 5 September 2016), LILACS (1982 to 5 September 2016), and mRCT (2007 to 5 September 2016). We also contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and searched reference lists.

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with acute watery diarrhoea (cholera and non-cholera associated) that compared polymer-based and glucose-based ORS (with identical electrolyte contents).

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results and risk of bias, and extracted data. In multiple-treatment arms with two or more treatment groups, we combined outcomes as appropriate and compared collectively with the control group.

MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five trials that included 4284 participants met the inclusion criteria: 28 trials exclusively included children, five included adults, and two included both adults and children. Polymer-based ORS versus glucose-based ORS (osmolarity ≤ 270) Eight trials (752 participants) evaluated this comparison, and seven trials used rice as a polymer source. Polymer-based ORS may decrease mean stool output in the first 24 hours by 24 mL/kg (mean difference (MD) -24.60 mL/kg, 95% CI -40.69 to -8.51; one trial, 99 participants, low quality evidence). The average duration of diarrhoea may be reduced by eight hours (MD -8.24 hours, 95% CI -13.17 to -3.30; I² statistic = 86%, five trials, 364 participants, low quality evidence) with polymer ORS but results are heterogeneous. Limited trials showed no observed difference in the risk of unscheduled use of intravenous fluid (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.02; I² statistic = 30%; four trials, 376 participants, very low quality evidence), vomiting (very low quality evidence), and hyponatraemia (very low quality evidence). Polymer-based ORS versus glucose-based ORS (osmolarity ≥ 310) Twenty-seven trials (3532 participants) evaluated this comparison using a variety of polymers. On average, polymer ORS may reduce the total stool output in the first 24 hours by around 65 mL/kg (MD -65.47 mL/kg, 95% CI -83.92 to -47.03; 16 trials, 1483 participants, low quality evidence), and may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by around eight hours (MD -8.57 hours; SD -13.17 to -4.03; 16 trials, 1137 participants, low quality evidence) with substantial heterogeneity. The proportion of participants that required intravenous hydration was low in most trials with fewer in the polymer ORS group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98; 19 trials, 1877 participant, low quality evidence) . Subgroup analysis by type of pathogen suggested an effect on unscheduled intravenous fluid in those infected with mixed pathogens (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96; 11 trials, 928 participants, low quality evidence), but not in participants positive for Vibrio cholerae (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 7 trials, 535 participants, low quality evidence). No difference was observed in the number of patients who developed vomiting (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.14; 10 trials, 584 participants, very low quality evidence), hyponatraemia (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.44; 4 trials, 385 participants, very low quality evidence), hypokalaemia (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.25; 2 trials, 260 participants, low quality evidence), or persistent diarrhoea (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.41; 2 trials, 885 participants, very low quality evidence).

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Polymer-based ORS shows advantages compared to glucose-based ORS (at ≥ 310 mOsm/L). Comparisons favoured polymer-based ORS over ORS ≤ 270 but analysis was underpowered.
28040774	Comparative "Omics" of the Fusarium fujikuroi Species Complex Highlights Differences in Genetic Potential and Metabolite Synthesis.	2016	Genome Biol Evol	Species of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFC) cause a wide spectrum of often devastating diseases on diverse agricultural crops, including coffee, fig, mango, maize, rice, and sugarcane. Although species within the FFC are difficult to distinguish by morphology, and their genes often share 90% sequence similarity, they can differ in host plant specificity and life style. FFC species can also produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites (SMs), including the mycotoxins fumonisins, fusarins, fusaric acid, and beauvericin, and the phytohormones gibberellins, auxins, and cytokinins. The spectrum of SMs produced can differ among closely related species, suggesting that SMs might be determinants of host specificity. To date, genomes of only a limited number of FFC species have been sequenced. Here, we provide draft genome sequences of three more members of the FFC: a single isolate of F. mangiferae, the cause of mango malformation, and two isolates of F. proliferatum, one a pathogen of maize and the other an orchid endophyte. We compared these genomes to publicly available genome sequences of three other FFC species. The comparisons revealed species-specific and isolate-specific differences in the composition and expression (in vitro and in planta) of genes involved in SM production including those for phytohormome biosynthesis. Such differences have the potential to impact host specificity and, as in the case of F. proliferatum, the pathogenic versus endophytic life style.
27907079	Identification of Pectin Degrading Enzymes Secreted by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Determination of Their Role in Virulence on Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae (Xoo) causes the serious bacterial blight disease of rice. Xoo secretes a repertoire of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) like cellulases, xylanases, esterases etc., which act on various components of the rice cell wall. The major cellulases and xylanases secreted by Xoo have been identified and their role in virulence has been determined. In this study, we have identified some of the pectin degrading enzymes of Xoo and assessed their role in virulence. Bioinformatics analysis indicated the presence of four pectin homogalacturonan (HG) degrading genes in the genome of Xoo. The four HG degrading genes include one polygalacturonase (pglA), one pectin methyl esterase (pmt) and two pectate lyases (pel and pelL). There was no difference in the expression of pglA, pmt and pel genes by laboratory wild type Xoo strain (BXO43) grown in either nutrient rich PS medium or in plant mimic XOM2 medium whereas the expression of pelL gene was induced in XOM2 medium as indicated by qRT-PCR experiments. Gene disruption mutations were generated in each of these four genes. The polygalacturonase mutant pglA- was completely deficient in degrading the substrate Na-polygalacturonicacid (PGA). Strains carrying mutations in the pmt, pel and pelL genes were as efficient as wild type Xoo (BXO43) in cleaving PGA. These observations clearly indicate that PglA is the major pectin degrading enzyme produced by Xoo. The pectin methyl esterase, Pmt, is the pectin de-esterifying enzyme secreted by Xoo as evident from the enzymatic activity assay performed using pectin as the substrate. Mutations in the pglA, pmt, pel and pelL genes have minimal effects on virulence. This suggests that, as compared to cellulases and xylanases, the HG degrading enzymes may not have a major role in the pathogenicity of Xoo.
27910910	Genome-wide characterisation and expression profile of the grapevine ATL ubiquitin ligase family reveal biotic and abiotic stress-responsive and development-related members.	2016	Sci Rep	The Arabidopsis Tóxicos en Levadura (ATL) protein family is a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases with a characteristic RING-H2 Zn-finger structure that mediates diverse physiological processes and stress responses in plants. We carried out a genome-wide survey of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) ATL genes and retrieved 96 sequences containing the canonical ATL RING-H2 domain. We analysed their genomic organisation, gene structure and evolution, protein domains and phylogenetic relationships. Clustering revealed several clades, as already reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), with an expanded subgroup of grapevine-specific genes. Most of the grapevine ATL genes lacked introns and were scattered among the 19 chromosomes, with a high level of duplication retention. Expression profiling revealed that some ATL genes are expressed specifically during early or late development and may participate in the juvenile to mature plant transition, whereas others may play a role in pathogen and/or abiotic stress responses, making them key candidates for further functional analysis. Our data offer the first genome-wide overview and annotation of the grapevine ATL family, and provide a basis for investigating the roles of specific family members in grapevine physiology and stress responses, as well as potential biotechnological applications.
27905546	Transcriptome analysis confers a complex disease resistance network in wild rice Oryza meyeriana against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the devastating diseases of rice. It is well established that the wild rice Oryza meyeriana is immune to BB. In this study, the transcriptomic analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing of O. meyeriana leaves, inoculated with Xoo to understand the transcriptional responses and interaction between the host and pathogen. Totally, 57,313 unitranscripts were de novo assembled from 58.7 Gb clean reads and 14,143 unitranscripts were identified after Xoo inoculation. The significant metabolic pathways related to the disease resistance enriched by KEGG, were revealed to plant-pathogen interaction, phytohormone signaling, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Further, many disease resistance genes were also identified to be differentially expressed in response to Xoo infection. Conclusively, the present study indicated that the induced innate immunity comprise the basal defence frontier of O. meyeriana against Xoo infection. And then, the resistance genes are activated. Simultaneously, the other signaling transduction pathways like phytohormones and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis may contribute to the disease defence through modulation of the disease-related genes or pathways. This could be an useful information for further investigating the molecular mechanism associated with disease resistance in O. meyeriana.
27992591	Relationship of Rice Grain Amylose, Gelatinization Temperature and Pasting Properties for Breeding Better Eating and Cooking Quality of Rice Varieties.	2016	PLoS One	A total of 787 non-waxy rice lines- 116 hybrids and 671 inbreds-were used to study the apparent amylose content (AAC), gelatinization temperature (GT), and rapid visco analyzer (RVA) pasting viscosity properties of rice starch to understand their importance in breeding better rice varieties. The investigated traits showed a wide range of diversity for both hybrid (HG) and inbred (IG) groups. The combinations of the different categories of AAC and GT were random in HG but were non-random in IG. For inbred lines, the high level of AAC tended to combine with the low level of GT, the intermediate level of AAC tended to have high or intermediate GT, and the low level of AAC tended to have high or low GT. Some stable correlations of the AAC, GT, and RVA properties may be the results derived from the physicochemical relationships among these traits, which rice breeders could utilize for selection in advanced breeding generations. Through cluster analysis, IG and HG were divided into 52 and 31 sub-clusters, respectively. Identifying the cultivars having AAC, GT, and RVA properties similar to that of popular high-quality rice varieties seems to be an interesting strategy and could be directly used for adaptation trials to breed high-quality rice varieties in targeted areas in a more customized manner.
28018373	Non-destructive Assessment of Plant Nitrogen Parameters Using Leaf Chlorophyll Measurements in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Non-destructive assessment of plant nitrogen (N) status is essential for efficient crop production and N management in intensive rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems. Chlorophyll meter (SPAD-502) has been widely used as a rapid, non-destructive and cost-effective diagnostic tool for in-season assessment of crop N status. The present study was intended to establish the quantitative relationships between chlorophyll meters readings, plant N concentration (PNC), N nutrition index (NNI), accumulated N deficit (AND), and N requirement (NR), as well as to compare the stability of these relationships at different vegetative growth stages in Japonica and Indica rice cultivars. Seven multi-locational field experiments using varied N rates and seven rice cultivars were conducted in east China. The results showed that the PNC and chlorophyll meters readings increased with increasing N application rates across the cultivars, growing seasons, and sites. The PNC and chlorophyll meters readings under varied N rates ranged from 2.29 to 3.21, 1.06 to 1.82 and 37.10 to 45.4 and 37.30 to 46.6, respectively, at TL and HD stages for Japonica rice cultivars, while they ranged from 2.25 to 3.23, 1.34 to 1.91 and 35.6 to 43.3 and 37.3 to 45.5 for Indica rice cultivars, respectively. The quantitative relationships between chlorophyll meters readings, PNC, NNI, AND, and NR established at different crop growth stages in two rice ecotypes, were highly significant with R2 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.93 and 0.71 to 0.86 for Japonica and Indica rice, respectively. The strongest relationships were observed for AND and NR at panicle initiation and booting stages in both rice ecotypes. The validation of the relationships developed in the present study with an independent data exhibited a solid model performance and confirmed their robustness as a reliable and rapid diagnostic tool for in-season estimation of plant N parameters for sustainable N management in rice. The results of this study will offer a suitable approach for managing N application precisely during the growth period of the rice crop in intensive rice cropping systems of east China.
28008549	Globisporangium oryzicola sp. nov., causing poor seedling establishment of directly seeded rice.	2017	Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek	A new species, Globisporangium oryzicola, was isolated from directly seeded rice seedlings, and from soils of paddy fields and an uncultivated field. Despite their different origins, five of the seven isolates studied caused poor seedling establishment of rice in a laboratory inoculation experiment. The species is characterized by oogonia with smooth-walled or sometimes one projection, with one to two antheridia, and aplerotic oospores. Hyphal swellings were rarely observed. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and 2 genes confirmed that the species differed from other Globisporangium species. This novel species is described and illustrated in detail.
27910900	Zn uptake behavior of rice genotypes and its implication on grain Zn biofortification.	2016	Sci Rep	Understanding Zn uptake dynamics is critical to rice grain Zn biofortification. Here we examined soil Zn availability and Zn uptake pathways as affected by genotype (high-grain Zn varieties IR69428 and IR68144), Zn fertilization and water management in two pot experiments. Results showed significant interactions (P < 0.05) between genotypes and Zn fertilization on DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)-extractable soil Zn from early tillering to flowering. DTPA-extractable Zn in soils grown with IR69428 was positively correlated with stem (r = 0.78, P < 0.01), flagleaf (r = 0.60, P < 0.01) and grain (r = 0.67, P < 0.01) Zn concentrations, suggesting improved soil Zn availability and continued soil Zn uptake by IR69428 even at maturity. Conversely for IR68144, DTPA-extractable Zn was positively correlated only with leaf Zn uptake (r = 0.60, P < 0.01) at active tillering, indicating dependence on remobilization for grain Zn loading. Furthermore, the highest grain Zn concentration (P < 0.05) was produced by a combination of IR69428 and Zn fertilization applied at panicle initiation (38.5 μg g-1) compared with other treatments (P < 0.05). The results highlight that Zn uptake behavior of a rice genotype determines the fate of Zn from the soil to the grain. This has implications on overcoming Zn translocation barriers between vegetative parts and grains, and achieving grain Zn biofortification targets (30.0 μg g-1).
27849025	PiHOG1, a stress regulator MAP kinase from the root endophyte fungus Piriformospora indica, confers salinity stress tolerance in rice plants.	2016	Sci Rep	In this study, yeast HOG1 homologue from the root endophyte Piriformospora indica (PiHOG1) was isolated and functionally characterized. Functional expression of PiHOG1 in S. cerevisiae ∆hog1 mutant restored osmotolerance under high osmotic stress. Knockdown (KD) transformants of PiHOG1 generated by RNA interference in P. indica showed that genes for the HOG pathway, osmoresponse and salinity tolerance were less stimulated in KD-PiHOG1 compared to the wild-type under salinity stress. Furthermore, KD lines are impaired in the colonization of rice roots under salinity stress of 200 mM NaCl, and the biomass of the host plants, their shoot and root lengths, root number, photosynthetic pigment and proline contents were reduced as compared to rice plants colonized by WT P. indica. Therefore, PiHOG1 is critical for root colonisation, salinity tolerance and the performance of the host plant under salinity stress. Moreover, downregulation of PiHOG1 resulted not only in reduced and delayed phosphorylation of the remaining PiHOG1 protein in colonized salinity-stressed rice roots, but also in the downregulation of the upstream MAP kinase genes PiPBS2 and PiSSK2 involved in salinity tolerance signalling in the fungus. Our data demonstrate that PiHOG1 is not only involved in the salinity response of P. indica, but also helping host plant to overcome salinity stress.
27762074	NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is closely related to leaf and flower development. Coordinative regulation of leaf, pollen, and seed development in rice as a critical biological and agricultural question should be addressed. Here we identified two allelic rice mutants with narrow and semi-rolled leaves, named narrow and rolled leaf 2-1 (nrl2-1) and nrl2-2. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that NRL2 encodes a novel protein with unknown biochemical function. The mutation of NRL2 caused pleiotropic effects, including a reduction in the number of longitudinal veins, defective abaxial sclerenchymatous cell differentiation, abnormal tapetum degeneration and microspore development, and the formation of more slender seeds compared with the wild type (WT). The NRL2 protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the nrl2 mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration. Thus, this gene is an essential developmental regulator controlling fundamental cellular and developmental processes, serving as a potential breeding target for high-yielding rice cultivars.
27882529	QTL Mapping of Grain Quality Traits Using Introgression Lines Carrying Oryza rufipogon Chromosome Segments in Japonica Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Improved eating quality is a major breeding target in japonica rice due to market demand. Consequently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for glossiness of cooked rice and amylose content associated with eating quality have received much research focus because of their importance in rice quality.

RESULTS: In this study, QTL associated with 12 grain quality traits were identified using 96 introgression lines (IL) of rice developed from an interspecific cross between the Korean elite O. sativa japonica cultivar 'Hwaseong' and O. rufipogon over 7 years. QTL analyses indicated that QTL qDTH6 for heading date, detected on chromosome 6 is associated with variance in grain traits. Most QTLs detected in this study clustered near the qDTH6 locus on chromosome 6, suggesting the effect of qDTH6. O. rufipogon alleles negatively affected grain quality traits except for a few QTLs, including qGCR9 for glossiness of cooked rice on chromosome 9. To characterize the effect of the O. rufipogon locus harboring qGCR9, four lines with a single but different O. rufipogon segment near qGCR9 were compared to Hwaseong. Three lines (O. rufipopgon ILs) having O. rufipogon segment between RM242 and RM245 in common showed higher glossiness of cooked rice than Hwaseong and the other line (Hwaseong IL), indicating that qGCR9 is located in the 3.4-Mb region between RM242 and RM245. Higher glossiness of cooked rice conferred by the O. rufipogon allele might be associated with protein content considering that three lines had lower protein content than Hwaseong (P < 0.1). These three O. rufipogon ILs showed higher yield than Hwaseong and Hwaseong IL due to increase in spikelets per panicle and grain weight indicating the linkage of qGCR9 and yield component QTLs.

CONCLUSION: The qGCR9 locus is of particular interest because of its independence from other undesirable grain quality traits in O. rufipogon. SSR markers linked to qGCR9 can be used to develop high-quality japonica lines and offer a starting point for map-based cloning of genes underlying this trait. To our knowledge, this is the first report to map a beneficial QTL for glossiness of cooked rice from a wild rice, O. rufipogon.
27862521	Design of an optimal promoter involved in the heat-induced transcriptional pathway in Arabidopsis, soybean, rice and maize.	2017	Plant J	Interactions between heat shock (HS) factors (HSFs) and heat shock response elements (HSEs) are important during the heat shock response (HSR) of flora and fauna. Moreover, plant HSFs that are involved in heat stress are also involved in abiotic stresses such as dehydration and cold as well as development, cell differentiation and proliferation. Because the specific combination of HSFs and HSEs involved in plants under heat stress remains unclear, the mechanism of their interaction has not yet been utilized in molecular breeding of plants for climate change. For the study reported herein, we compared the sequences of HS-inducible genes and their promoters in Arabidopsis, soybean, rice and maize and then designed an optimal HS-inducible promoter. Our analyses suggest that, for the four species, the abscisic acid-independent, HSE/HSF-dependent transcriptional pathway plays a major role in HS-inducible gene expression. We found that an 18-bp sequence that includes the HSE has an important role in the HSR, and that those sequences could be classified as representative of monocotyledons or dicotyledons. With the HS-inducible promoter designed based on our bioinformatic predictions, we were able to develop an optimal HS-specific inducible promoter for seedlings or single cells in roots. These findings demonstrate the utility of our HS-specific inducible promoter, which we expect will contribute to molecular breeding efforts and cell-targeted gene expression in specific plant tissues.
27848161	Genome-wide Association Mapping of Cold Tolerance Genes at the Seedling Stage in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is a temperature-sensitive crop and its production is severely affected by low temperature in temperate and sub-tropical regions. To understand the genetic basis of cold tolerance in rice, we evaluated the cold tolerance at the seedling stage (CTS) of 295 rice cultivars in the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1), these cultivars were collected from 82 countries.

RESULTS: The evaluations revealed that both temperate and tropical japonica rice cultivars are more tolerant to cold stress than indica and AUS cultivars. Using the cold tolerance phenotypes and 44 K SNP chip dataset of RDP1, we performed genome-wide association mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for CTS. The analysis identified 67 QTLs for CTS that are located on 11 chromosomes. Fifty-six of these QTLs are located in regions without known cold tolerance-related QTLs.

CONCLUSION: Our study has provided new information on the genetic architecture of rice cold tolerance and has also identified highly cold tolerant cultivars and CTS-associated SNP markers that will be useful rice improvement.
27814357	A Novel Tiller Angle Gene, TAC3, together with TAC1 and D2 Largely Determine the Natural Variation of Tiller Angle in Rice Cultivars.	2016	PLoS Genet	Tiller angle is one of the most important components of the ideal plant architecture that can greatly enhance rice grain yield. Understanding the genetic basis of tiller angle and mining favorable alleles will be helpful for breeding new plant-type varieties. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes controlling tiller angle using 529 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa including 295 indica and 156 japonica accessions in two environments. We identified 7 common quantitative trait loci (QTLs), including the previously reported major gene Tiller Angle Control 1 (TAC1), in the two environments, 10 and 13 unique QTLs in Hainan and Wuhan, respectively. More QTLs were identified in indica than in japonica, and three major QTLs (qTA3, qTA1b/DWARF2 (D2) and qTA9c/TAC1) were fixed in japonica but segregating in indica, which explained the wider variation observed in indica compared with that in japonica. No common QTLs were identified between the indica and japonica subpopulations. Mutant analysis for the candidate gene of qTA3 on chromosome 3 indicated a novel gene, Tiller Angle Control 3 (TAC3), encoding a conserved hypothetical protein controlling tiller angle. TAC3 is preferentially expressed in the tiller base. The ebisu dwarf (d2) mutant exhibited a decreased tiller angle, in addition to its previously described abnormal phenotype. A nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that TAC3, D2 and TAC1 have been subjected to selection during japonica domestication. A haplotype analysis identified favorable alleles of TAC3, D2 and TAC1, which may be used for breeding plants with an ideal architecture. In conclusion, there is a diverse genetic basis for tiller angle between the two subpopulations, and it is the novel gene TAC3 together with TAC1, D2, and other newly identified genes in this study that controls tiller angle in rice cultivars.
27933072	Development and Evaluation of Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines Carrying Overlapping Chromosome Segments of the Whole Wild Rice Genome.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) represents an important resource for rice improvement. Genetic populations provide the basis for a wide range of genetic and genomic studies. In particular, chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) are most powerful tools for the detection and precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, 146 CSSLs were produced; they were derived from the crossing and back-crossing of two rice cultivars: Dongnanihui 810 (Oryza sativa L.), an indica rice cultivar as the recipient, and ZhangPu wild rice, a wild rice cultivar as the donor. First, a physical map of the 146 CSSLs was constructed using 149 molecular markers. Based on this map, the total size of the 147 substituted segments in the population was 1145.65 Mb, or 3.04 times that of the rice genome. To further facilitate gene mapping, heterozygous chromosome segment substitution lines (HCSSLs) were also produced, which were heterozygous in the target regions. Second, a physical map of the 244 HCSSLs was produced using 149 molecular markers. Based on this map, the total length of substituted segments in the HCSSLs was 1683.75 Mb, or 4.47 times the total length of the rice genome. Third, using the 146 CSSLs, two QTLs for plant height, and one major QTL for apiculus coloration were identified. Using the two populations of HCSSLs, the qPa-6-2 gene was precisely mapped to an 88 kb region. These CSSLs and HCSSLs may, therefore, provide powerful tools for future whole genome large-scale gene discovery in wild rice, providing a foundation enabling the development of new rice varieties. This research will also facilitate fine mapping and cloning of quantitative trait genes, providing for the development of superior rice varieties.
27902802	Identification and Characterization of Quantitative Trait Loci for Shattering in Rice Landrace Jiucaiqing from Taihu Lake Valley, China.	2016	Plant Genome	Easy shattering reduces yield from grain loss during rice ( L.) harvest. We characterized a nonshattering rice landrace Jiucaiqing from Taihu Lake valley in China. The breaking tensile strength (BTS; grams force, gf) of the grain pedicel was measured using a digital force gauge to evaluate the degree of shattering at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d after heading (DAH). The BTS of Jiucaiqing did not significantly decrease with increasing DAH, maintaining a level of 152.2 to 195.9 gf, while that of IR26 decreased greatly during 0 to 14 DAH and finally stabilized at ∼100 gf. Then the chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and near isogenic lines (NILs) of Jiucaiqing in IR26 background were developed for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Four putative QTL (, , , and ) for shattering were detected, and the was confirmed on chromosome 1. We further mapped to a 98.4-kb region, which contains 14 genes. Os01g62920 was considered to be a strong candidate for , which colocated with . Further quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses confirmed that the QTL can significantly decrease the expression of shattering related genes (, , , , and ) especially at the middle development stage at 10 and 15 cm panicle length, which causes rice shattering decrease. The elite allele and the NIL with desirable agronomic traits identified in this study could be useful for rice breeding.
27881984	Gene Discovery and Advances in Finger Millet [<i>Eleusine coracana</i> (L.) Gaertn.] Genomics-An Important Nutri-Cereal of Future.	2016	Front Plant Sci	The rapid strides in molecular marker technologies followed by genomics, and next generation sequencing advancements in three major crops (rice, maize and wheat) of the world have given opportunities for their use in the orphan, but highly valuable future crops, including finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.]. Finger millet has many special agronomic and nutritional characteristics, which make it an indispensable crop in arid, semi-arid, hilly and tribal areas of India and Africa. The crop has proven its adaptability in harsh conditions and has shown resilience to climate change. The adaptability traits of finger millet have shown the advantage over major cereal grains under stress conditions, revealing it as a storehouse of important genomic resources for crop improvement. Although new technologies for genomic studies are now available, progress in identifying and tapping these important alleles or genes is lacking. RAPDs were the default choice for genetic diversity studies in the crop until the last decade, but the subsequent development of SSRs and comparative genomics paved the way for the marker assisted selection in finger millet. Resistance gene homologs from NBS-LRR region of finger millet for blast and sequence variants for nutritional traits from other cereals have been developed and used invariably. Population structure analysis studies exhibit 2-4 sub-populations in the finger millet gene pool with separate grouping of Indian and exotic genotypes. Recently, the omics technologies have been efficiently applied to understand the nutritional variation, drought tolerance and gene mining. Progress has also occurred with respect to transgenics development. This review presents the current biotechnological advancements along with research gaps and future perspective of genomic research in finger millet.
27877189	Genome-Wide Differences in DNA Methylation Changes in Two Contrasting Rice Genotypes in Response to Drought Conditions.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Differences in drought stress tolerance within diverse rice genotypes have been attributed to genetic diversity and epigenetic alterations. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that influences diverse biological processes, but its effects on rice drought stress tolerance are poorly understood. In this study, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and an Affymetrix GeneChip rice genome array were used to profile the DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes of the drought-tolerant introgression line DK151 and its drought-sensitive recurrent parent IR64 under drought and control conditions. The introgression of donor genomic DNA induced genome-wide DNA methylation changes in DK151 plants. A total of 1190 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected between the two genotypes under normal growth conditions, and the DMR-associated genes in DK151 plants were mainly related to stress response, programmed cell death, and nutrient reservoir activity, which are implicated to constitutive drought stress tolerance. A comparison of the DNA methylation changes in the two genotypes under drought conditions indicated that DK151 plants have a more stable methylome, with only 92 drought-induced DMRs, than IR64 plants with 506 DMRs. Gene ontology analyses of the DMR-associated genes in drought-stressed plants revealed that changes to the DNA methylation status of genotype-specific genes are associated with the epigenetic regulation of drought stress responses. Transcriptome analysis further helped to identify a set of 12 and 23 DMR-associated genes that were differentially expressed in DK151 and IR64, respectively, under drought stress compared with respective controls. Correlation analysis indicated that DNA methylation has various effects on gene expression, implying that it affects gene expression directly or indirectly through diverse regulatory pathways. Our results indicate that drought-induced alterations to DNA methylation may influence an epigenetic mechanism that regulates the expression of unique genes responsible for drought stress tolerance.
27965705	Characterization and Genetic Analysis of Rice Mutant <i>crr1</i> Exhibiting Compromised Non-host Resistance to <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>).	2016	Front Plant Sci	Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in China. Rapid change to virulence following release of resistant cultivars necessitates ongoing discovery and exploitation of new resistance resources. Considerable effort has been directed at non-host resistance (NHR) which is believed to be durable. In the present study we identified rice mutant crr1 (compromised resistance to rust 1) that exhibited compromised NHR to Pst. Compared with wild type rice variety Nipponbare, crr1 mutant displayed a threefold increase in penetration rate by Pst, and enhanced hyphal growth. The pathogen also developed haustoria in crr1 mesophyll cells, but failed to sporulate. The response to the adapted rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae was unchanged in crr1 relative to the wild type. Several defense-related genes involved in the SA- and JA-mediated defense pathways response and in phytoalexin synthesis (such as OsPR1a, OsLOX1, and OsCPS4) were more rapidly and strongly induced in infected crr1 leaves than in the wild type, suggesting that other layers of defense are still in effect. Genetic analysis and mapping located the mutant loci at a region between markers ID14 and RM25792, which cover about 290 kb genome sequence on chromosome 10. Further fine mapping and cloning of the locus should provide further insights into NHR to rust fungi in rice, and may reveal new strategies for improving rust resistance in wheat.
27965688	Mutations in <i>Rice yellow mottle virus</i> Polyprotein P2a Involved in <i>RYMV2</i> Gene Resistance Breakdown.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is one of the major diseases of rice in Africa. The high resistance of the Oryza glaberrima Tog7291 accession involves a null allele of the RYMV2 gene, whose ortholog in Arabidopsis, CPR5, is a transmembrane nucleoporin involved in effector-triggered immunity. To optimize field deployment of the RYMV2 gene and improve its durability, which is often a weak point in varietal resistance, we analyzed its efficiency toward RYMV isolates representing the genetic diversity of the virus and the molecular basis of resistance breakdown. Tog7291 resistance efficiency was highly variable depending on the isolate used, with infection rates ranging from 0 to 98% of plants. Back-inoculation experiments indicated that infection cases were not due to an incomplete resistance phenotype but to the emergence of resistance-breaking (RB) variants. Interestingly, the capacity of the virus to overcome Tog7291 resistance is associated with a polymorphism at amino-acid 49 of the VPg protein which also affects capacity to overcome the previously studied RYMV1 resistance gene. This polymorphism appeared to be a main determinant of the emergence of RB variants. It acts independently of the resistance gene and rather reflects inter-species adaptation with potential consequences for the durability of resistance. RB mutations were identified by full-length or partial sequencing of the RYMV genome in infected Tog7291 plants and were validated by directed mutagenesis of an infectious viral clone. We found that Tog7291 resistance breakdown involved mutations in the putative membrane anchor domain of the polyprotein P2a. Although the precise effect of these mutations on rice/RYMV interaction is still unknown, our results offer a new perspective for the understanding of RYMV2 mediated resistance mechanisms. Interestingly, in the susceptible IR64 variety, RB variants showed low infectivity and frequent reversion to the wild-type genotype, suggesting that Tog7291 resistance breakdown is associated with a major loss of viral fitness in normally susceptible O. sativa varieties. Despite the high frequency of resistance breakdown in controlled conditions, this loss of fitness is an encouraging element with regards to RYMV2 resistance durability.
27891136	Characterization of Salinity Tolerance of Transgenic Rice Lines Harboring <i>HsCBL8</i> of Wild Barley (<i>Hordeum spontanum</i>) Line from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice is more sensitive to salinity, particularly at its early vegetative and later productive stages. Wild plants growing in harsh environments such as wild barley from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau adapt to the adverse environment with allelic variations at the loci responsible for stressful environment, which could be used for rice genetic improvement. In this study, we overexpressed HsCBL8 encoding a calcium-sensor calcineurin B-like (CBL) protein in rice. The gene was isolated from XZ166, a wild-barley (Hordeum spontanum) line originated from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We found that XZ166 responded to high NaCl concentration (200 mM) with more HsCBL8 transcripts than CM72, a cultivated barley line known for salinity tolerance. XZ166 is significantly different from CM72 with nucleotide sequences at HsCBL8. The overexpression of HsCBL8 in rice resulted in significant improvement of water protection in vivo and plasma membrane, more proline accumulation, and a reduction of overall Na+ uptake but little change in K+ concentration in the plant tissues. Notably, HsCBL8 did not act on some genes downstream of the rice CBL family genes, suggesting an interesting interaction between HsCBL8 and unknown factors to be further investigated.
27841331	Abscinazole-E3M, a practical inhibitor of abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase for improving drought tolerance.	2016	Sci Rep	Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential phytohormone that regulates plant water use and drought tolerance. However, agricultural applications of ABA have been limited because of its rapid inactivation in plants, which involves hydroxylation of ABA by ABA 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A). We previously developed a selective inhibitor of CYP707A, (-)-Abz-E2B, by structurally modifying S-uniconazole, which functions as an inhibitor of CYP707A and as a gibberellin biosynthetic enzyme. However, its synthetic yield is too low for practical applications. Therefore, we designed novel CYP707A inhibitors, Abz-T compounds, that have simpler structures in which the 1,2,3-triazolyl ring of (-)-Abz-E2B has been replaced with a triple bond. They were successfully synthesised in shorter steps, resulting in greater yields than that of (-)-Abz-E2B. In the enzymatic assays, one of the Abz-T compounds, (-)-Abz-E3M, acted as a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP707A, similar to (-)-Abz-E2B. Analysis of the biological effects in Arabidopsis revealed that (-)-Abz-E3M enhanced ABA's effects more than (-)-Abz-E2B in seed germination and in the expression of ABA-responsive genes. Treatment with (-)-Abz-E3M induced stomatal closure and improved drought tolerance in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, (-)-Abz-E3M also increased the ABA response in rice and maize. Thus, (-)-Abz-E3M is a more practical and effective inhibitor of CYP707A than (-)-Abz-E2B.
27900550	Biogenesis of diverse plant phasiRNAs involves an miRNA-trigger and Dicer-processing.	2017	J Plant Res	It has been almost 30 years since RNA interference (RNAi) was shown to silence genes via double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fire et al. 1998). 20-30-nucleotide (nt) small non-coding RNAs are a key element of the RNAi machinery. Recently, phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), small RNAs that are generated from a long RNA precursor at intervals of 21 to 26-nt, have been identified in plants and animals. In Drosophila, phasiRNAs are generated by the endonuclease, Zucchini (Zuc), in germlines. These phasiRNAs, known as one of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), mainly repress transposable elements. Similarly, reproduction-specific phasiRNAs have been identified in the family Poaceae, although DICER LIKE (DCL) protein-dependent phasiRNA biogenesis in rice is distinct from piRNA biogenesis in animals. In plants, phasiRNA biogenesis is initiated when 22-nt microRNAs (miRNAs) cleave single-stranded target RNAs. Subsequently, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) forms dsRNAs from the cleaved RNAs, and dsRNAs are further processed by DCLs into 21 to 24-nt phasiRNAs. Finally, the phasiRNAs are loaded to ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins to induce RNA-silencing. There are diverse types of phasiRNA precursors and the miRNAs that trigger the biogenesis. Their expression patterns also differ among plant species, suggesting that species-specific combinations of these triggers dictate the spatio-temporal pattern of phasiRNA biogenesis during development, or in response to environmental stimuli.
27875742	Map-based cloning and characterization of the novel yellow-green leaf gene ys83 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Leaf-color mutants have been extensively studied in rice, and many corresponding genes have been identified up to now. However, leaf-color mutation mechanisms are diverse and still need further research through identification of novel genes. In the present paper, we isolated a leaf-color mutant, ys83, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant displayed a yellow-green leaf phenotype at seedling stage, and then slowly turned into light-green leaf from late tillering stage. In its yellow leaves, photosynthetic pigment contents significantly decreased and the chloroplast development was retarded. The mutant phenotype was controlled by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 2. Map-based cloning and sequencing analysis suggested that the candidate gene was YS83 (LOC_Os02g05890) encoding a protein containing 165 amino acid residues. Gene YS83 was expressed in a wide range of tissues, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast. In the mutant, a T-to-A substitution occurred in coding sequence of gene YS83, which caused a premature translation of its encoded product. By introduction of the wild-type gene, the ys83 mutant recovered to normal green-leaf phenotype. Taken together, we successfully identified a novel yellow-green leaf gene YS83. In addition, number of productive panicles per plant and number of spikelets per panicle only reduced by 6.7% and 7.6%, respectively, meanwhile its seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight (seed size) were not significantly affected in the mutant, so leaf-color mutant gene ys83 could be used as a trait marker gene in commercial hybrid rice production.
27717469	De novo transcriptome assembly and identification of the gene conferring a "pandan-like" aroma in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.).	2016	Plant Sci	Thailand's aromatic coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a special type of green dwarf coconut, the liquid endosperm of which is characterized by a pleasant "pandan-like" aroma due to the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). The aim of this study was to perform a de novo assembly of transriptome from C. nucifera endosperm and to identify the gene responsible for 2AP biosynthesis. CnAMADH2 was identified as an ortholog of the rice aromatic gene and a G-to-C substitution found in exon 14 was associated with 2AP content in the aromatic green dwarf coconut accessions. The base substitution caused an amino-acid change, alanine-to-proline, at position 442 (P442A). The presence of P at this position might alter the steric conformation at the loop region and subsequently result in an unstabilized dimer conformation that could lower AMADH enzyme activity. Among AMADH/BADH protein sequences in different plant species, the P442A mutation was found exclusively in aromatic coconut. The PCR marker developed based on this sequence variation can perfectly detect the aromatic and non-aromatic alleles of the gene. This study confirms the hypothesis that plants may share a mechanism of 2AP biosynthesis. This is the first identification of the gene associated with 2AP biosynthesis in a tree plant.
27901067	A chitin deacetylase from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. efficiently inactivates the elicitor activity of chitin oligomers in rice cells.	2016	Sci Rep	To successfully survive in plants, endophytes need strategies to avoid being detected by the plant immune system, as the cell walls of endophytes contain easily detectible chitin. It is possible that endophytes "hide" this chitin from the plant immune system by modifying it, or oligomers derived from it, using chitin deacetylases (CDA). To explore this hypothesis, we identified and expressed a CDA from Pestalotiopsis sp. (PesCDA), an endophytic fungus, in E. coli and characterized this enzyme and its chitosan oligomer products. We found that when PesCDA modifies chitin oligomers, the products are partially deacetylated chitosan oligomers with a specific acetylation pattern: GlcNAc-GlcNAc-(GlcN)n-GlcNAc (n ≥ 1). Then, in a bioactivity assay where suspension-cultured rice cells were incubated with the PesCDA products (processed chitin hexamers), we found that, unlike the substrate hexamers, chitosan oligomer products no longer elicited the plant immune system. Thus, this endophytic enzyme can prevent the endophyte from being recognized by the plant immune system; this might represent a more general hypothesis for how certain fungi are able to live in or on their hosts.
27889940	Sequencing of Australian wild rice genomes reveals ancestral relationships with domesticated rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The related A genome species of the Oryza genus are the effective gene pool for rice. Here, we report draft genomes for two Australian wild A genome taxa: O. rufipogon-like population, referred to as Taxon A, and O. meridionalis-like population, referred to as Taxon B. These two taxa were sequenced and assembled by integration of short- and long-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to create a genomic platform for a wider rice gene pool. Here, we report that, despite the distinct chloroplast genome, the nuclear genome of the Australian Taxon A has a sequence that is much closer to that of domesticated rice (O. sativa) than to the other Australian wild populations. Analysis of 4643 genes in the A genome clade showed that the Australian annual, O. meridionalis, and related perennial taxa have the most divergent (around 3 million years) genome sequences relative to domesticated rice. A test for admixture showed possible introgression into the Australian Taxon A (diverged around 1.6 million years ago) especially from the wild indica/O. nivara clade in Asia. These results demonstrate that northern Australia may be the centre of diversity of the A genome Oryza and suggest the possibility that this might also be the centre of origin of this group and represent an important resource for rice improvement.
27865844	Perturbations of carotenoid and tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways result in differential alterations in chloroplast function and plastid signaling.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	In this study, we used the biosynthetic inhibitors of carotenoid and tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways, norflurazon (NF) and oxyfluorfen (OF), as tools to gain insight into mechanisms of photooxidation in rice plants. NF resulted in bleaching symptom on leaves of the treated plants, whereas OF treatment developed a fast symptom of an apparent necrotic phenotype. Both plants exhibited decreases in photosynthetic efficiency, as indicated by Fv/Fm. NF caused severe disruption in thylakoid membranes, whereas OF-treated plants exhibited disruption of chloroplast envelope and plasma membrane. Levels of Lhca and Lhcb proteins in photosystem I (PSI) and PSII were reduced by photooxidative stress in NF- and OF-treated plants, with a greater decrease in NF plants. The down-regulation of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes Lhcb and rbcS was also found in both NF- and OF-treated plants, whereas plastid-encoded photosynthetic genes including RbcL, PsaC, and PsbD accumulated normally in NF plants but decreased drastically in OF plants. This proposes that the plastids in NF plants retain their potential to develop thylakoid membranes and that photobleaching is mainly controlled by nuclear genes. Distinct photooxidation patterns between NF- and OF-treated plants developed differential signaling, which might enable the plant to coordinate the expression of photosynthetic genes from the nuclear and plastidic genomes.
27825304	OxyR-regulated catalase CatB promotes the virulence in rice via detoxifying hydrogen peroxide in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	BMC Microbiol	BACKGROUND: To facilitate infection, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, needs to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by the host defense response via a mechanism that is mediated by the transcriptional regulator OxyR. The catalase (CAT) gene catB has previously been shown to belong to the OxyR regulon in Xoo. However, its expression patterns and function in H2O2 detoxification and bacterial pathogenicity on rice remain to be elucidated.

RESULTS: The catB gene encodes a putative catalase and is highly conserved in the sequenced strains of Xanthomonas spp. β-galactosidase analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that OxyR positively regulated the transcription of catB by directly binding to its promoter region. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays revealed that the expression levels of catB and oxyR were significantly induced by H2O2. Deletion of catB or oxyR drastically impaired bacterial viability in the presence of extracellular H2O2 and reduced CAT activity, demonstrating that CatB and OxyR contribute to H2O2 detoxification in Xoo. In addition, ΔcatB and ΔoxyR displayed shorter bacterial blight lesions and reduced bacterial growth in rice compared to the wild-type stain, indicating that CatB and OxyR play essential roles in the virulence of Xoo.

CONCLUSIONS: Transcription of catB is enhanced by OxyR in response to exogenous H2O2. CatB functions as an active catalase that is required for the full virulence of Xoo in rice.
27895204	Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	Phosphate overaccumulator2 (PHO2) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in rice (Oryza sativa; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in rice protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the "WCGPC" motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in rice protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves and rice seedlings. Characterization of rice pho2 complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic OsPHO2 or OsPHO2C445S (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that OsPHO2C445S restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native OsPHO2 Moreover, the suppression of OsTrxh1 (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in rice.
27894970	Genome-wide characterization of the SiDof gene family in foxtail millet (Setaria italica).	2017	Biosystems	Dof (DNA binding with one finger) proteins, which constitute a class of transcription factors found exclusively in plants, are involved in numerous physiological and biochemical reactions affecting growth and development. A genome-wide analysis of SiDof genes was performed in this study. Thirty five SiDof genes were identified and those genes were unevenly distributed across nine chromosomes in the Seteria italica genome. Protein lengths, molecular weights, and theoretical isoelectric points of SiDofs all vary greatly. Gene structure analysis demonstrated that most SiDof genes lack introns. Phylogenetic analysis of SiDof proteins and Dof proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, sorghum, and Setaria viridis revealed six major groups. Analysis of RNA-Seq data indicated that SiDof gene expression levels varied across roots, stems, leaves, and spike. In addition, expression profiling of SiDof genes in response to stress suggested that SiDof 7 and SiDof 15 are involved in drought stress signalling. Overall, this study could provide novel information on SiDofs for further investigation in foxtail millet.
27874312	Momilactone B Inhibits Ketosis In Vitro by Regulating the ANGPTL3-LPL Pathway and Inhibiting HMGCS2.	2017	Anim Biotechnol	Ketogenesis is the production of ketone bodies, which provide energy when the body lacks glucose. Under ketogenic conditions, the body switches from primarily carbohydrate to fat metabolism to maintain energy balance. However, accumulation of high levels of ketone bodies in the blood results in ketosis. Treating ketosis with natural substances is preferable, because they are unlikely to cause side-effects. Momilactone B is an active compound isolated from Korean rice. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that momilactone B could inhibit ketosis. We constructed an in vitro ketosis model by glucose starvation. We used this model to test the anti-ketosis effects of momilactone B. A primary target for treating ketosis is angiopoietin-like-3 (ANGPTL3), which modulates lipoprotein metabolism by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a multifunctional enzyme that breaks down stored fat to produce triglycerides. We showed that momilactone B could regulate the ANGPTL3-LPL pathway. However, a strong anti-ketosis candidate drug should also inhibit ketogenesis. Ketogenesis can be suppressed by inhibiting the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase-2 (HMGCS2), a mitochondrial enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA to ketone bodies. We found that momilactone B suppressed the expression of HMGCS2 through the increased expression of STAT5b. We also elucidated the relationship of STAT5b to ANGPTL3 and LPL expression.
27819540	Fine Mapping of a New Race-Specific Blast Resistance Gene, Pi-hk2, in Japonica Heikezijing from Taihu Region of China.	2017	Phytopathology	Heikezijing, a japonica rice landrace from the Taihu region of China, exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to more than 300 isolates of the blast pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae). In our previous research, we fine mapped a broad-spectrum resistance gene, Pi-hk1, in chromosome 11. In this research, 2010-9(G1), one of the predominant races of blast in the Taihu Lake region of China, was inoculated into 162 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and two parents, Heikezijing and Suyunuo, for mapping the resistance-blast quantitative trait loci (QTL). Three QTL (Lsqtl4-1, Lsqtl9-1, and Lsqtl11-1) associated with lesion scores were detected on chromosomes 4, 9, and 11 and two QTL (Lnqtl1-1 and Lnqtl9-1) associated with average lesion numbers were detected on chromosomes 1 and 9. The QTL Lsqtl9-1 conferring race-specific resistance to 2010-9(G1) at seedling stages showed logarithm of the odds scores of 9.10 and phenotypic variance of 46.19% and might be a major QTL, named Pi-hk2. The line RIL84 with Pi-hk2 derived from a cross between Heikezijing and Suyunuo was selected as Pi-hk2 gene donor for developing fine mapping populations. According to the resistance evaluation of recombinants of three generations (BC1F2, BC1F3, and BC1F4), Pi-hk2 was finally mapped to a 143-kb region between ILP-19 and RM24048, and 18 candidate genes were predicted, including genes that encode pleiotropic drug resistance protein 4 (n = 2), WRKY74 (n = 1), cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain containing protein (n = 1), protein kinase (n = 1), and ankyrin repeat family protein (n = 1). These results provide essential information for cloning of Pi-hk2 and its potential utility in breeding resistant rice cultivars by marker-assisted selection.
27809780	Dual functions of the ZmCCT-associated quantitative trait locus in flowering and stress responses under long-day conditions.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Photoperiodism refers to the ability of plants to measure day length to determine the season. This ability enables plants to coordinate internal biological activities with external changes to ensure normal growth. However, the influence of the photoperiod on maize flowering and stress responses under long-day (LD) conditions has not been analyzed by comparative transcriptome sequencing. The ZmCCT gene was previously identified as a homolog of the rice photoperiod response regulator Ghd7, and associated with the major quantitative trait locus (QTL) responsible for Gibberella stalk rot resistance in maize. However, its regulatory mechanism has not been characterized.

RESULTS: We mapped the ZmCCT-associated QTL (ZmCCT-AQ), which is approximately 130 kb long and regulates photoperiod responses and resistance to Gibberella stalk rot and drought in maize. To investigate the effects of ZmCCT-AQ under LD conditions, the transcriptomes of the photoperiod-insensitive inbred line Huangzao4 (HZ4) and its near-isogenic line (HZ4-NIL) containing ZmCCT-AQ were sequenced. A set of genes identified by RNA-seq exhibited higher basal expression levels in HZ4-NIL than in HZ4. These genes were associated with responses to circadian rhythm changes and biotic and abiotic stresses. The differentially expressed genes in the introgressed regions of HZ4-NIL conferred higher drought and heat tolerance, and stronger disease resistance relative to HZ4. Co-expression analysis and the diurnal expression rhythms of genes related to stress responses suggested that ZmCCT and one of the circadian clock core genes, ZmCCA1, are important nodes linking the photoperiod to stress tolerance responses under LD conditions.

CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that the photoperiod influences flowering and stress responses under LD conditions. Additionally, ZmCCT and ZmCCA1 are important functional links between the circadian clock and stress tolerance. The establishment of this particular molecular link has uncovered a new relationship between plant photoperiodism and stress responses.
27873004	Use of a novel metal indicator to judge loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detecting the 35S promoter.	2017	Anal Bioanal Chem	Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a widely used isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. Here we developed a new closed-tube colorimetric method for judging LAMP with a novel metal indicator. First, the metal indicator, acid chrome blue K (ACBK), was evaluated in the LAMP reaction with various combinations of reaction reagents, such as reaction buffer, dNTP mixtures, primer mixtures, or Mg2+. We found that the solution color of the LAMP reaction with ACBK changed from red to blue based on a decrease in the Mg2+ concentration in the reaction solution. We then optimized the LAMP with ACBK method for detecting the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter. Further, the specificity of the new colorimetric assay using ACBK in the LAMP reaction for detecting the 35S promoter was tested with diverse transgenic events in different crops, and the sensitivity threshold of the assay was ∼50 copies for transgenic rice genomic DNA and 100 ng of 0.1 % DNA from rice, soybean, rapeseed, and maize. Finally, the applicability of the LAMP assay was successfully validated using practical maize samples. All the detection results could be easily discerned either by UV-vis spectroscopy or the naked eye. Graphical Abstract The visual detect LAMP amplification by the addition of ACBK as a signal indicator. The color of the LAMP-ACBK solution turned from red to blue as the concentration of free Mg2+ decreases. The detection results could be easily discerned either by UV-vis spectroscopy or the naked eye.
27853319	Genetic determination of the enhanced drought resistance of rice maintainer HuHan2B by pedigree breeding.	2016	Sci Rep	The ongoing deficit of fresh water resource in rice growing regions has made the selection of water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR) a crucial factor in developing sustainable cultivation. HuHan2B, a new japonica maintainer for WDR breeding, had the same yield potential as recurrent parent HanFengB but showed improved drought resistance in fields. We investigated the genomic content accumulation and candidate genes passed from parent to offspring using the genomic and transcriptomic approaches. The genomic constitution indicated that the genetic similarity was 84% between HuHan2B and HanFengB; additionally, 7,256 genes with specific alleles were inherited by HuHan2B from parents other than HanFengB. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under drought stress showed that biological function was significantly enriched for transcript regulation in HuHan2B, while the oxidation-reduction process was primarily enriched in HanFengB. Furthermore, 36 DEGs with specific inherited alleles in HuHan2B were almost involved in the regulatory network of TFs and target genes. These findings suggested that major-effect genes were congregated and transformed into offspring in manner of interacting network by breeding. Thus, exploiting the potential biological function of allelic-influencing DEGs would be of great importance for improving selection efficiency and the overall genetic gain of multiple complex traits.
27900537	RNAi-mediated resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf virus in transgenic rice.	2017	Transgenic Res	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae, causes significant economic losses in rice production in China and many other Asian countries. Development of resistant varieties by using conventional breeding methods is limited, as germplasm with high level of resistance to RBSDV have not yet been found. One of the most promising methods to confer resistance against RBSDV is the use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology. RBSDV non-structural protein P7-2, encoded by S7-2 gene, is a potential F-box protein and involved in the plant-virus interaction through the ubiquitination pathway. P8, encoded by S8 gene, is the minor core protein that possesses potent active transcriptional repression activity. In this study, we transformed rice calli using a mini-twin T-DNA vector harboring RNAi constructs of the RBSDV genes S7-2 or S8, and obtained plants harboring the target gene constructs and the selectable marker gene, hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT). From the offspring of these transgenic plants, we obtained selectable marker (HPT gene)-free plants. Homozygous T5 transgenic lines which harbored either S7-2-RNAi or S8-RNAi exhibited high level resistance against RBSDV under field infection pressure from indigenous viruliferous small brown planthoppers. Thus, our results showed that RNA interference with the expression of S7-2 or S8 genes seemed an effective way to induce high level resistance in rice against RBSD disease.
27819727	Changes in gene expression and catalase activity in Oryza sativa L. under abiotic stress.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Different rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes were subjected to high salinity and low temperature (150 mM NaCl and 13°C, respectively) for 0, 6, 24, 48, or 72 h. We evaluated the simultaneous expression of the genes OsCATA, OsCATB, and OsCATC, correlated gene expression with enzyme activity, and verified the regulation of these genes through identification of cis-elements in the promoter region. The hydrogen peroxide content increased in a tolerant genotype and decreased in a sensitive genotype under both stress conditions. Lipid peroxidation increased in the tolerant genotype when exposed to cold, and in the sensitive genotype when exposed to high salinity. Catalase activity significantly increased in both genotypes when subjected to 13°C. In the tolerant genotype, OsCATA and OsCATB were the most responsive to high salinity and cold, while in the sensitive genotype, OsCATA and OsCATC responded positively to saline stress, as did OsCATA and OsCATB to low temperature. Cis-element analysis identified different regulatory sequences in the catalase promoter region of each genotype. The sensitive genotype maintained a better balance between hydrogen oxyacid levels, catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation under low temperature than the resistant genotype. OsCATA and OsCATB were the most responsive in the salt-tolerant genotype to cold, OsCATA and OsCATC were the most responsive to saline stress, and OsCATA and OsCATB were the most responsive to chilling stress in the sensitive genotype. There were positive correlations between catalase activity and OsCATB expression in the tolerant genotype under saline stress and in the sensitive genotype under cold stress.
27974904	Evaluation of a Standardized Extract from <i>Morus alba</i> against <i>α</i>-Glucosidase Inhibitory Effect and Postprandial Antihyperglycemic in Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance: A Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial.	2016	Evid Based Complement Alternat Med	To evaluate the antihyperglycemic effect of a standardized extract of the leaves of Morus alba (SEMA), the present study was designed to investigate the α-glucosidase inhibitory effect and acute single oral toxicity as well as evaluate blood glucose reduction in animals and in patients with impaired glucose tolerance in a randomized double-blind clinical trial. SEMA was found to inhibit α-glucosidase at a fourfold higher level than the positive control (acarbose), in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, blood glucose concentration was suppressed by SEMA in vivo. Clinical signs and weight changes were observed when conducting an evaluation of the acute toxicity of SEMA through a single-time administration, with clinical observation conducted more than once each day. After administration of the SEMA, observation was for 14 days; all of the animals did not die and did not show any abnormal symptoms. In addition, the inhibitory effects of rice coated with SEMA were evaluated in a group of impaired glucose tolerance patients on postprandial glucose and a group of normal persons, and results showed that SEMA had a clear inhibitory effect on postprandial hyperglycemia in both groups. Overall, SEMA showed excellent potential in the present study as a material for improving postprandial hyperglycemia.
27858291	Molecular characterization of a novel ssRNA ourmia-like virus from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Arch Virol	In this study we characterize a novel positive and single stranded RNA (ssRNA) mycovirus isolated from the rice field isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae Guy11. The ssRNA contains a single open reading frame (ORF) of 2,373 nucleotides in length and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) closely related to ourmiaviruses (plant viruses) and ourmia-like mycoviruses. Accordingly, we name this virus Magnaporthe oryzae ourmia-like virus 1 (MOLV1). Although phylogenetic analysis suggests that MOLV1 is closely related to ourmia and ourmia-like viruses, it has some features never reported before within the Ourmiavirus genus. 3' RLM-RACE (RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and extension poly(A) tests (ePAT) suggest that the MOLV1 genome contains a poly(A) tail whereas the three cytosine and the three guanine residues present in 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ourmia viruses are not observed in the MOLV1 sequence. The discovery of this novel viral genome supports the hypothesis that plant pathogenic fungi may have acquired this type of viruses from their host plants.
27837430	Isolation and Characterization of an Aluminum-resistant Mutant in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Aluminum (Al) toxicity represents a major constraint for crop production on acid soils. Rice is a high Al-resistant plant species among small-grain cereals, but its molecular mechanisms of Al resistance are not fully understood. We adopted a forward genetic screen strategy to uncover the Al-resistance mechanisms in rice. In this study, we screened an ethylmethylsulfone (EMS)-mutagenized library to isolate and characterize mutants with altered sensitivity to Al in rice.

RESULTS: Treatment of an Al-intolerant indica variety Kasalath with 20 μM Al induced root swelling. This phenotype could be suppressed by the addition of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, an ethylene synthesis inhibitor), suggesting that increased production of ethylene is responsible for the root swelling under Al stress. By utilizing the root swelling as an indicator, we developed a highly effective method to screen Al-sensitive or -resistant mutants in rice. Through screening of ~5000 M2 lines, we identified 10 Al-sensitive mutants and one Al-resistant mutant ral1 (resistance to aluminum 1). ral1 mutant showed short root phenotype under normal growth condition, which was attributed to reduced cell elongation in the mutant. A dose-response experiment revealed that ral1 mutant was more resistant to Al than wild-type (WT) at all Al concentrations tested. The mutant was also more resistant to Al when grown in an acid soil. The mutant accumulated much lower Al in the root tips (0-1 cm) than WT. The mutant contained less Al in the cell wall of root tips than WT, whereas Al concentration in the cell sap was similar between WT and the mutant. In addition to Al, the mutant was also more resistant to Cd than WT. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of known Al-resistance genes were not increased in the mutant compared to WT. Genetic analysis indicated that the Al-resistance phenotype in ral1 mutant was controlled by a single recessive gene mapped on the long arm of chromosome 6.

CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a highly efficient method for the screening of rice mutants with altered Al sensitivity. We identified a novel mutant ral1 resistant to Al by this screening. The increased resistance of ral1 to Al toxicity is caused by the reduced Al binding to the cell wall of root tips and the responsible gene is mapped on the long arm of chromosome 6.
27837098	Transcription Factor WRKY62 Plays a Role in Pathogen Defense and Hypoxia-Responsive Gene Expression in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	WRKY62 is a transcriptional repressor regulated downstream of WRKY45, a central transcription factor of the salicylic acid signaling pathway in rice. Previously, WRKY62 was reported to regulate defense negatively. However, our expressional analysis using WRKY62-knockdown rice indicated that WRKY62 positively regulates defense genes, including diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes and their transcriptional regulator DPF. Blast and leaf blight resistance tests also showed that WRKY62 is a positive defense regulator. Yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays showed that WRKY45 and WRKY62 can form a heterodimer, as well as homodimers, that bind to W-boxes in the DPF promoter. In transient assays in rice sheaths, the simultaneous introduction of WRKY45 and WRKY62 as effectors resulted in a strong activation of the DPF promoter:hrLUC reporter gene, whereas the activity declined with excessive WRKY62. Thus, the WRKY45-WRKY62 heterodimer acts as a strong activator, while the WRKY62 homodimer acts as a repressor. While benzothiadiazole induced equivalent numbers of WRKY45 and WRKY62 transcripts, consistent with heterodimer formation and DPF activation, submergence and nitrogen replacement induced only WRKY62 transcripts, consistent with WRKY62 homodimer formation and DPF repression. Moreover, WRKY62 positively regulated hypoxia genes, implying a role forWRKY62 in the modulation of the 'trade-off' between defense and hypoxia responses.
27811915	Interfering TAL effectors of Xanthomonas oryzae neutralize R-gene-mediated plant disease resistance.	2016	Nat Commun	Plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas possess transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that activate transcription of disease susceptibility genes in the host, inducing a state of disease. Here we report that some isolates of the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae use truncated versions of TALEs (which we term interfering TALEs, or iTALEs) to overcome disease resistance. In comparison with typical TALEs, iTALEs lack a transcription activation domain but retain nuclear localization motifs and are expressed from genes that were previously considered pseudogenes. We show that the rice gene Xa1, encoding a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein, confers resistance against X. oryzae isolates by recognizing multiple TALEs. However, the iTALEs present in many isolates interfere with the otherwise broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Xa1. Our findings illustrate how bacterial effectors that trigger disease resistance in the host can evolve to interfere with the resistance process and, thus, promote disease.
27881987	Microscopic and Molecular Characterization of the Prehaustorial Resistance against Wheat Leaf Rust (<i>Puccinia triticina</i>) in Einkorn (<i>Triticum monococcum</i>).	2016	Front Plant Sci	Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici (Eriks.), the causal agent of leaf rust, causes substantial yield losses in wheat production. In wheat many major leaf rust resistance genes have been overcome by virulent races. In contrast, the prehaustorial resistance (phr) against wheat leaf rust detected in the diploid wheat Einkorn (Triticum monoccocum var. monococcum) accession PI272560 confers race-independent resistance against isolates virulent on accessions harboring resistance genes located on the A-genome of Triticum aestivum. Phr in PI272560 leads to abortion of fungal development during the formation of haustorial mother cells and to increased hydrogen peroxide concentration in comparison to the susceptible accession 36554 (Triticum boeoticum ssp. thaoudar var. reuteri). Increased peroxidase and endochitinase activity was detected in PI272560 within 6 h after inoculation (hai). Comparative transcriptome profiling using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) in infected and non-infected leaves detected 14220 differentially expressed tags in PI272560 and 15472 in accession 36554. Of these 2908 and 3004, respectively, could be assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) categories of which 463 were detected in both accessions and 311 were differentially expressed between the accessions. In accordance with the concept of non-host resistance in PI272560, genes with similarity to peroxidases, chitinases, β-1,3-glucanases and other pathogenesis-related genes were up-regulated within the first 8 hai, whereas up-regulation of such genes was delayed in 36554. Moreover, a Phosphoribulokinase gene contributing to non-host resistance in rice against stripe rust was exclusively expressed in the resistant accession PI272560. Gene expression underpinned physiological and phenotypic observations at the site of infection and are in accordance with the concept of non-host resistance.
27876142	Magnetic polyethyleneimine functionalized reduced graphene oxide as a novel magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the determination of polar acidic herbicides in rice.	2017	Anal Chim Acta	A novel magnetic polyethyleneimine modified reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4@PEI-RGO) had been fabricated based on a self-assemble approach between positive charged magnetic polyethyleneimine (Fe3O4@PEI) and negative charged GO sheets via electrostatic interaction followed by chemical reduction of GO to RGO. The as-prepared Fe3O4@PEI-RGO was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and zeta potential analysis, and then was successfully applied to determine four phenoxy acid herbicides and dicamba in rice coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As a surface modifier of RGO, PEI not only effectually affected the surface property of RGO (e.g. zeta potential), but also changed the polarity of RGO and offered anion exchange groups to polar acidic herbicides, which would directly influence the type of adsorbed analytes. Compared with Fe3O4@PEI, Fe3O4/RGO and Fe3O4@PEI-GO, the as-prepared Fe3O4@PEI-RGO, integrating the superiority of PEI and RGO, showed higher extraction efficiency for polar acidic herbicides. Besides, the adsorption mechanism was investigated as well. It turned out that electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction were considered to be two major driving force for the adsorption process. Response surface methodology (RSM), a multivariate experimental design technique, was used to optimize experimental parameters affecting the extraction efficiency in detail. Under the optimal conditions, a satisfactory performance was obtained. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranging from 2 to 300 ng g-1 with correlation coefficients (r) between 0.9985 and 0.9994. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.67-2 ng g-1. The recoveries ranged from 87.41% to 102.52% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 8.94%. Taken together, the proposed method was an efficient pretreatment and enrichment procedure and could be successfully applied for selective extraction and determination of polar acidic herbicides in complex matrices.
27889499	The OsAMT1.1 gene functions in ammonium uptake and ammonium-potassium homeostasis over low and high ammonium concentration ranges.	2016	J Genet Genomics	Rice (Oryza sativa) grown in paddy fields is an ammonium (NH4+)-preferring crop; however, its AMT-type NH4+ transporters that mediate root N acquisition have not been well characterized yet. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern and physiological function of the OsAMT1.1 gene of the AMT1 subfamily in rice. OsAMT1.1 is located in the plasma membrane and is mainly expressed in the root epidermis, stele and mesophyll cells. Disruption of the OsAMT1.1 gene decreased the uptake of NH4+, and the growth of roots and shoots under both low NH4+ and high NH4+ conditions. OsAMT1.1 contributed to the short-term (5 min) 15NH4+ influx rate by approximately one-quarter, irrespective of the NH4+ concentration. Knockout of OsAMT1.1 significantly decreased the total N transport from roots to shoots under low NH4+ conditions. Moreover, compared with the wild type, the osamt1.1 mutant showed an increase in the potassium (K) absorption rate under high NH4+ conditions and a decrease under low NH4+ conditions. The mutants contained a significantly high concentration of K in both the roots and shoots at a limited K (0.1 mmol/L) supply when NH4+ was replete. Taken together, the results indicated that OsAMT1.1 significantly contributes to the NH4+ uptake under both low and high NH4+ conditions and plays an important role in N-K homeostasis in rice.
27878453	Evaluation of stability and validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR expression studies in rice plants under water deficit.	2017	J Appl Genet	Many studies use strategies that allow for the identification of a large number of genes expressed in response to different stress conditions to which the plant is subjected throughout its cycle. In order to obtain accurate and reliable results in gene expression studies, it is necessary to use reference genes, which must have uniform expression in the majority of cells in the organism studied. RNA isolation of leaves and expression analysis in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were carried out. In this study, nine candidate reference genes were tested, actin 11 (ACT11), ubiquitin conjugated to E2 enzyme (UBC-E2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta tubulin (β-tubulin), eukaryotic initiation factor 4α (eIF-4α), ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10), ubiquitin 5 (UBQ5), aquaporin TIP41 (TIP41-Like) and cyclophilin, in two genotypes of rice, AN Cambará and BRS Querência, with different levels of soil moisture (20%, 10% and recovery) in the vegetative (V5) and reproductive stages (period preceding flowering). Currently, there are different softwares that perform stability analyses and define the most suitable reference genes for a particular study. In this study, we used five different methods: geNorm, BestKeeper, ΔCt method, NormFinder and RefFinder. The results indicate that UBC-E2 and UBQ5 can be used as reference genes in all samples and softwares evaluated. The genes β-tubulin and eIF-4α, traditionally used as reference genes, along with GAPDH, presented lower stability values. The gene expression of basic leucine zipper (bZIP23 and bZIP72) was used to validate the selected reference genes, demonstrating that the use of an inappropriate reference can induce erroneous results.
27817046	Production and Purification of Recombinant Glucocerebrosidase in Transgenic Rice Cell Suspension Cultures.	2017	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Gaucher disease, which is caused by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GCD), is currently treated by enzyme replacement therapy. Plant-based systems produce glycoproteins and can be combined with targeting strategies to generate proteins with terminal mannose structures for macrophage uptake. However, the gliding step for the purification is essential since the produced protein still exists inside cells. In the case of rice-amylase 1A (RAmy1A) secretion signal peptide, GCD protein is secreted outside of cells and simplifies the purification step. Here, an established cell line was confirmed as having fundamental characteristics of growth and production. GCD from transgenic calli was examined by Western blot analysis and compared with that from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Calli expressing high levels of GCD were used to establish suspension cell lines. Growth and production characteristics were investigated in suspension cell cultures. Production of GCD in suspension cultures was confirmed upon induction for 12-24 h. The amount of GCD in medium increased until 60-84 h and decreased thereafter. Purification of GCD was performed in three steps (ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography) and verified. Purified GCD was able to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate. Thus, a rice expression system could be a suitable alternative to GCD expression in mammalian cells.
27835850	Rice mutants deficient in ω-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD8) fail to acclimate to cold temperatures.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	To investigate the role of ω-3 fatty acid (FA) desaturase (FAD8) during cold acclimation in higher plants, we characterized three independent T-DNA insertional knock-out mutants of OsFAD8 from rice (Oryza sativa L.). At room temperature (28 °C), osfad8 plants exhibited significant alterations in fatty acid (FA) unsaturation for all four investigated plastidic lipid classes. During a 5-d acclimation period at 4 °C, further changes in FA unsaturation in both wild-type (WT) and mutant plants varied according to the type of lipid. We also monitored the fluidity of the thylakoid membrane using a threshold temperature to represent the change in fluorescence. The values were altered significantly by both FAD8 mutation and cold acclimation, suggesting that factors other than FAD8 are involved in C18 FA unsaturation and fluctuations in membrane fluidity. Similarly, significant changes were noted for both the mutant and WT samples in terms of their FA compositions as well as activities related to photosystem (PS) I, PSII, and photoprotection. This included the development of non-photochemical quenching and increased zeaxanthin accumulation. Despite the relatively small changes in FA composition during cold acclimation, cold-inducible FAD8 knock-out mutants displayed strong differences in photoprotective activities and a further drop in membrane fluidity. The mutants were more sensitive than WT to short-term low-temperature stress that resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species after 5 d of chilling. Taken together, our findings suggest that FA unsaturation by OsFAD8 is crucial for the acclimation of higher plants to low-temperature stress.
27815966	MicroRNA-mediated regulation of flower development in grasses.	2016	Acta Biochim Pol	Flower structure in grasses is very unique. There are no petals or sepals like in eudicots but instead flowers develop bract-like structures - palea and lemma. Reproductive organs are enclosed by round lodicule that not only protects reproductive organs but also plays an important role during flower opening. The first genetic model for floral organ development was proposed 25 years ago and it was based on the research on model eudicots. Since then, studies have been carried out to answer the question whether this model could be applicable in the case of monocots. Genes from all classes found in eudicots have been also identified in genomes of such monocots like rice, maize or barley. What's more, it seems that miRNA-mediated regulation of floral organ genes that was observed in the case of Arabidopsis thaliana also takes place in monocots. MiRNA172, miRNA159, miRNA171 and miRNA396 regulate expression of floral organ identity genes in barley, rice and maize, affecting various features of the flower structure, ranging from formation of lemma and palea to the development of reproductive organs. A model of floral development in grasses and its genetic regulation is not yet fully characterized. Further studies on both, the model eudicots and grasses, are needed to unravel this topic. This review provides general overview of genetic model of flower organ identity specification in monocots and it's miRNA-mediated regulation.
27815670	Novel rice mutants overexpressing the brassinosteroid catabolic gene CYP734A4.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: Moderate overexpression of CYP734A4 improves grain number per main panicle and seed setting rate. Brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and signaling are crucial for plant growth and development. CYP734A genes encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that control the level of bioactive BRs by degrading BRs. However, fertile plants overexpressing CYP734As have not been reported in rice. Here, we isolated a novel semi-dominant mutant brd3-D, in which T-DNA was inserted approximately 4 kb upstream of the CYP734A4 gene (GenBank Accession AB488667), causing its overexpression. The mutant is characterized by dwarfism, small grains, and erect leaves and is less sensitive to brassinolide-induced lamina joint inclination and primary root elongation. However, increased grain number per main panicle and improved seed setting rate were also found in heterozygous brd3-D. To our knowledge, these traits have not been reported in other BR deficient mutants. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that phenotypic severity of the brd3-D mutant is positively correlated with the CYP734A4 transcription level. In accordance with the increased expression of CYP734A4, a lower castasterone (a rice BR) content was detected in the brd3-D mutants. Knockout of brd3-D by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system rescued the mutation. In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing CYP734A4 with the 35S enhancer mimicked the brd3-D phenotypes, confirming that moderate overexpression of the CYP734A4 gene can improve grain number per main panicle and the seed setting rate in rice. Further studies showed that overexpression of CYP734A4 influences the expressions of multiple genes involved in the BR pathway, and the expression of CYP734A4 is induced by exogenous brassinolide, confirming the negative regulatory role of CYP734A4 in the BR pathway. CYP734A4 might provide a useful gene resource for developing new high-yielding rice varieties.
27900723	SMALL GRAIN 11 Controls Grain Size, Grain Number and Grain Yield in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Grain size is one of key agronomic traits that determine grain yield in rice. Several regulators of grain size have been identified in rice, but the mechanisms that determine grain size and yield remain largely unknown.

RESULTS: Here we characterize a small grain (smg11) mutant in rice, which exhibits small grains, dense panicles and the increased number of grains per panicle. Cloning and sequence analyses of the SMG11 gene reveal that smg11 is a new allele of DWARF2 (D2), which encodes a cytochrome P450 (CYP90D2) involved in brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway. Overexpression of D2/SMG11 increases grain size and grain weight of wild-type plants. Overexpression of D2/SMG11 at a suitable level also significantly increases grain yield in rice. Cellular analyses indicate that D2/SMG11 controls grain size by promoting cell expansion. Further results reveal that D2/SMG11 influences expression of several known grain size genes involved in the regulation of cell expansion, revealing a novel link between D2/SMG11 and known grain size genes.

CONCLUSIONS: SMG11 controls grain size by promoting cell expansion in grain hulls. SMG11 regulates cell expansion, at least in part, by influencing expression of several grain size genes involved in the regulation of cell expansion. The smg11 is a new allele of DWARF2/D2. The suitable expression of SMG11 increases grain size, grain weight and grain yield. Our findings reveal the functions of D2/SMG11 in grain size and grain yield, suggesting that the suitable expression of D2/SMG11 is a promising approach to improve grain yield in rice.
27830537	Association mapping of resistance to rice blast in upland field conditions.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice blast is one of the most damaging disease of rice. The use of resistant cultivars is the only practical way to control the disease in developing countries where most farmers cannot afford fungicides. However resistance often breaks down. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) allow high resolution exploration of rice genetic diversity for quantitative and qualitative resistance alleles that can be combined in breeding programs to achieve durability. We undertook a GWAS of resistance to rice blast using a tropical japonica panel of 150 accessions genotyped with 10,937 markers and an indica panel of 190 accessions genotyped with 14,187 markers.

RESULTS: The contrasted distribution of blast disease scores between the indica and tropical japonica groups observed in the field suggest a higher level of quantitative resistance in the japonica panel than in the indica panel. In the japonica panel, two different loci significantly associated with blast resistance were identified in two experimental sites. The first, detected by seven SNP markers located on chromosome 1, colocalized with a cluster of four NBS-LRR including the two cloned resistance genes Pi37 and Pish/Pi35. The second is located on chromosome 12 and is associated with partial resistance to blast. In the indica panel, we identified only one locus associated with blast resistance. The three markers significantly detected at this locus were located on chromosome 8 in the 240 kb region carrying Pi33, which encompasses a cluster of three nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRRs) and six LRR-kinases in the Nipponbare sequence. Within this region, there is an insertion in the IR64 sequence compared to the Nipponbare sequence which also contains resistance gene analogs. Pi33 may belong to this insertion. The analysis of haplotype diversity in the target region revealed two distinct haplotypes, both associated with Pi33 resistance.

CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to identify three chromosomal regions associated with resistance in the field through GWAS in this study. Future research should concentrate on specific indica markers targeting the identified insertion in the Pi33 zone. Specific experimental designs should also be implemented to dissect quantitative resistance among tropical japonica varieties.
27914544	Resistance monitoring and cross-resistance patterns of three rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens, Sogatella furcifera and Laodelphax striatellus to dinotefuran in China.	2016	Pestic Biochem Physiol	Three rice planthoppers, brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, white-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera and small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus, are important pests of cultivated rice in tropical and temperate Asia. They have caused severe economic loss and developed resistance to insecticides from most chemical classes. Dinotefuran is the third neonicotinoid which possesses a broad spectrum and systemic insecticidal activity. We determined the susceptibility of dinotefuran to field populations from major rice production areas in China from 2013 to 2015. All the populations of S. furcifera and L. striatellus were kept susceptible to dinotefuran (0.7 to 1.4-fold of S. furcifera and 1.1-to 3.4-fold of L. striatellus) However, most strains of N. lugens (except FQ15) collected in 2015 had developed moderate resistance to dinotefuran, with resistance ratios (RR) ranging from 23.1 to 100.0 folds. Cross-resistance studies showed that chlorpyrifos-resistant and buprofezin-resistant Sogatella furcifera, chlorpyrifos-resistant and fipronil-resistant L. striatellus, imidacloprid-resistant and buprofezin-resistant Nilaparvata lugens exhibited negligible or no cross-resistance to dinotefuran. Synergism tests showed that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) produced a high synergism of dinotefuran effects in the DY15 and JS15 populations (2.14 and 2.52-fold, respectively). The obvious increase in resistance to dinotefuran in N. lugens indicates that insecticide resistance management strategies are urgently needed to prevent or delay further increase of insecticide resistance in N. lugens.
27876888	Bph32, a novel gene encoding an unknown SCR domain-containing protein, confers resistance against the brown planthopper in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	An urgent need exists to identify more brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH) resistance genes, which will allow the development of rice varieties with resistance to BPH to counteract the increased incidence of this pest species. Here, using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing approaches, we identified a novel BPH resistance gene, LOC_Os06g03240 (MSU LOCUS ID), from the rice variety Ptb33 in the interval between the markers RM19291 and RM8072 on the short arm of chromosome 6, where a gene for resistance to BPH was mapped by Jirapong Jairin et al. and renamed as "Bph32". This gene encodes a unique short consensus repeat (SCR) domain protein. Sequence comparison revealed that the Bph32 gene shares 100% sequence identity with its allele in Oryza latifolia. The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH. Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24 h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH. Western blotting revealed the presence of Pph (Ptb33) and Tph (TN1) proteins using a Penta-His antibody, and both proteins were insoluble. This study provides information regarding a valuable gene for rice defence against insect pests.
27838237	CC-type glutaredoxins recruit the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS to TGA-dependent target promoters in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2017	Biochim Biophys Acta	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are small proteins which bind glutathione to either reduce disulfide bonds or to coordinate iron sulfur clusters. Whereas these well-established functions are associated with ubiquitously occurring GRXs that encode variants of a CPYC or a CGFS motif in the active center, land plants also possess CCxC/S-type GRXs (named ROXYs in Arabidopsis thaliana) for which the biochemical functions are yet unknown. ROXYs and CC-type GRXs from rice and maize physically and genetically interact with bZIP transcription factors of the TGA family to control developmental and stress-associated processes. Here we demonstrate that ROXYs interact with transcriptional co-repressors of the TOPLESS (TPL) family which are related to Tup1 in fungi and Groucho/TLE in animals. In ROXYs, the functionally important conserved A(L/I)W(L/V) motif at the very C terminus mediates the interaction with TPL. A ternary TGA2/ROXY19/TPL complex is formed when all three proteins are co-expressed in yeast. Loss-of-function evidence for the role of TPL in ROXY19-mediated repression was hampered by the redundancy of the five members of the TPL gene family and developmental defects of higher order tpl mutants. As an alternative strategy, we ectopically expressed known TPL-interacting proteins in order to out-compete the amount of available TPL in transiently transformed protoplasts. Indeed, ROXY19-mediated transcriptional repression was strongly alleviated by this approach. Our data suggest a yet unrecognized function of GRXs acting as adapter proteins for the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes on TGA-regulated target promoters.
27902426	Unravelling the biosynthesis of pyriculol in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Microbiology	Pyriculol was isolated from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and found to induce lesion formation on rice leaves. These findings suggest that it could be involved in virulence. The gene MoPKS19 was identified to encode a polyketide synthase essential for the production of the polyketide pyriculol in the rice blast fungus M. oryzae. The transcript abundance of MoPKS19 correlates with the biosynthesis rate of pyriculol in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, gene inactivation of MoPKS19 resulted in a mutant unable to produce pyriculol, pyriculariol and their dihydro derivatives. Inactivation of a putative oxidase-encoding gene MoC19OXR1, which was found to be located in the genome close to MoPKS19, resulted in a mutant exclusively producing dihydropyriculol and dihydropyriculariol. By contrast, overexpression of MoC19OXR1 resulted in a mutant strain only producing pyriculol. The MoPKS19 cluster, furthermore, comprises two transcription factors MoC19TRF1 and MoC19TRF2, which were both found individually to act as negative regulators repressing gene expression of MoPKS19. Additionally, extracts of ΔMopks19 and ΔMoC19oxr1 made from axenic cultures failed to induce lesions on rice leaves compared to extracts of the wild-type strain. Consequently, pyriculol and its isomer pyriculariol appear to be the only lesion-inducing secondary metabolites produced by M. oryzae wild-type (MoWT) under these culture conditions. Interestingly, the mutants unable to produce pyriculol and pyriculariol were as pathogenic as MoWT, demonstrating that pyriculol is not required for infection.
27881876	The efficacy of high-throughput sequencing and target enrichment on charred archaeobotanical remains.	2016	Sci Rep	The majority of archaeological plant material is preserved in a charred state. Obtaining reliable ancient DNA data from these remains has presented challenges due to high rates of nucleotide damage, short DNA fragment lengths, low endogenous DNA content and the potential for modern contamination. It has been suggested that high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies coupled with DNA enrichment techniques may overcome some of these limitations. Here we report the findings of HTS and target enrichment on four important archaeological crops (barley, grape, maize and rice) performed in three different laboratories, presenting the largest HTS assessment of charred archaeobotanical specimens to date. Rigorous analysis of our data - excluding false-positives due to background contamination or incorrect index assignments - indicated a lack of endogenous DNA in nearly all samples, except for one lightly-charred maize cob. Even with target enrichment, this sample failed to yield adequate data required to address fundamental questions in archaeology and biology. We further reanalysed part of an existing dataset on charred plant material, and found all purported endogenous DNA sequences were likely to be spurious. We suggest these technologies are not suitable for use with charred archaeobotanicals and urge great caution when interpreting data obtained by HTS of these remains.
27845739	Impact of SNPs on Protein Phosphorylation Status in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used in functional genomics and genetics research work. The high-quality sequence of rice genome has provided a genome-wide SNP and proteome resource. However, the impact of SNPs on protein phosphorylation status in rice is not fully understood. In this paper, we firstly updated rice SNP resource based on the new rice genome Ver. 7.0, then systematically analyzed the potential impact of Non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on the protein phosphorylation status. There were 3,897,312 SNPs in Ver. 7.0 rice genome, among which 9.9% was nsSNPs. Whilst, a total 2,508,261 phosphorylated sites were predicted in rice proteome. Interestingly, we observed that 150,197 (39.1%) nsSNPs could influence protein phosphorylation status, among which 52.2% might induce changes of protein kinase (PK) types for adjacent phosphorylation sites. We constructed a database, SNP_rice, to deposit the updated rice SNP resource and phosSNPs information. It was freely available to academic researchers at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn. As a case study, we detected five nsSNPs that potentially influenced heterotrimeric G proteins phosphorylation status in rice, indicating that genetic polymorphisms showed impact on the signal transduction by influencing the phosphorylation status of heterotrimeric G proteins. The results in this work could be a useful resource for future experimental identification and provide interesting information for better rice breeding.
27876748	Driving Pest Insect Populations: Agricultural Chemicals Lead to an Adaptive Syndrome in Nilaparvata Lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2016	Sci Rep	The brown planthopper (BPH) is a devastating pest of rice throughout Asia. In this paper we document the BPH biogeographic range expansion in China over the 20-year period, 1992 to 2012. We posed the hypothesis that the range expansion is due to a syndrome of adaptations to the continuous presence of agricultural chemicals (insecticides and a fungicide) over the last 40 years. With respect to biogeography, BPH ranges have expanded by 13% from 1992 to 1997 and by another 3% from 1997 to 2012. In our view, such expansions may follow primarily from the enhancing effects of JGM, among other agricultural chemicals, and from global warming. JGM treatments led to increased thermotolerance, recorded as decreased mortality under heat stress at 40 ± 1 °C (down from 80% to 55%) and increased fecundity (by 49%) at 34 °C. At the molecular level, JGM treatments led to increased abundances of mRNA encoding Acetyl Co-A carboxylase (Acc) (up 25%) and Hsp70 (up 32%) in experimental BPH. RNAi silencing of Hsp70 and Acc eliminated the JGM effects on fecundity and silencing Hsp70 reduced JGM-induced thermotolerance. Integrated with global climate change scenarios, such syndromes in pest insect species have potential for regional- and global-scale agricultural disasters.
27889933	Development and field performance of nitrogen use efficient rice lines for Africa.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are a major input cost in rice production, and its excess application leads to major environmental pollution. Development of rice varieties with improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is essential for sustainable agriculture. Here, we report the results of field evaluations of marker-free transgenic NERICA4 (New Rice for Africa 4) rice lines overexpressing barley alanine amino transferase (HvAlaAT) under the control of a rice stress-inducible promoter (pOsAnt1). Field evaluations over three growing seasons and two rice growing ecologies (lowland and upland) revealed that grain yield of pOsAnt1:HvAlaAT transgenic events was significantly higher than sibling nulls and wild-type controls under different N application rates. Our field results clearly demonstrated that this genetic modification can significantly increase the dry biomass and grain yield compared to controls under limited N supply. Increased yield in transgenic events was correlated with increased tiller and panicle number in the field, and evidence of early establishment of a vigorous root system in hydroponic growth. Our results suggest that expression of the HvAlaAT gene can improve NUE in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes. The NUE technology described in this article has the potential to significantly reduce the need for N fertilizer and simultaneously improve food security, augment farm economics and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the rice ecosystem.
27874087	Development of Commercial Thermo-sensitive Genic Male Sterile Rice Accelerates Hybrid Rice Breeding Using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TMS5 Editing System.	2016	Sci Rep	Hybrid rice breeding offers an important strategy to improve rice production, in which the cultivation of a male sterile line is the key to the success of cross-breeding. CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been widely used in target-site genome editing, whereas their application for crop genetic improvement has been rarely reported. Here, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we induced specific mutations in TMS5, which is the most widely applied thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) gene in China, and developed new "transgene clean" TGMS lines. We designed 10 target sites in the coding region of TMS5 for targeted mutagenesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessed the potential rates of on- and off-target effects. Finally, we established the most efficient construct, the TMS5ab construct, for breeding potentially applicable "transgene clean" TGMS lines. We also discussed factors that affect the editing efficiency according to the characteristics of different target sequences. Notably, using the TMS5ab construct, we developed 11 new "transgene clean" TGMS lines with potential applications in hybrid breeding within only one year in both rice subspecies. The application of our system not only significantly accelerates the breeding of sterile lines but also facilitates the exploitation of heterosis.
27862861	The overexpression of insect endogenous small RNAs in transgenic rice inhibits growth and delays pupation of striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis).	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis Walker, is a major rice insect pest worldwide. RNA interference (RNAi) has become a promising strategy for developing insect-resistant crops. In a previous study, five double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting important SSB housekeeping genes were overexpressed in rice, but none of the acquired dsRNA-transgenic rice plants showed significant effects on SSB.

RESULTS: Thirteen selected SSB endogenous small RNAs, predicted as SSB novel microRNAs (miRNAs), were overexpressed in rice using artificial miRNA (amiRNA) expression technology. Feeding tests showed that two out of 13 selected SSB novel miRNAs caused significant growth inhibition for feeding SSB larvae based on transgenic rice expression. Pupation was delayed 4 days when SSB larvae consecutively fed on transgenic rice expressing the SSB novel miRNA candidate csu-novel-miR15 (csu-15 rice). Gene expression analysis confirmed that the expression levels of at least six SSB unigenes significantly changed (i.e., were up- or down-regulated) after feeding on csu-15 rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated a novel RNAi strategy using SSB endogenous small RNAs to develop RNAi crops for pest management; this strategy is different from the common RNAi resulting from transgenic dsRNAs or amiRNAs targeting certain insect endogenous genes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.
28007175	Transformation of hydroxylated and methoxylated 2,2',4,4',5-brominated diphenyl ether (BDE-99) in plants.	2016	J Environ Sci (China)	The occurrence and fate of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) have received significant attention. However, there is limited information on the metabolism relationship between OH-pentaBDEs and MeO-pentaBDEs that were frequently detected with relatively high concentrations in the environment. In this study, the biotransformation between OH-BDE-99 and MeO-BDE-99 was investigated in rice, wheat, and soybean plants. All the three plants can metabolize OH-BDE-99 to corresponding homologous methoxylated metabolites, while the transformation from MeO-BDE-99 to OH-BDE-99 could only be found in soybean. The conversion of parent compounds was the highest in soybean, followed by wheat and rice. Transformation products were found mainly in the roots, with few metabolites being translocated to the shoots and solution after exposure. The results of this study provide valuable information for a better understanding of the accumulation and transformation of OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs in different plants.
27671120	Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Is Required for Rice Immune Response and Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae Infection.	2016	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Recent studies have suggested that ethylene enhances host resistance to fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Among the six 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes in rice, OsACS1 and OsACS2 are induced within 24 h of inoculation by M. oryzae. This induction occurs simultaneously with an increase in ethylene production that is noticeable 12 h postinoculation. The purpose of this study was to examine the dynamics of ethylene production and signaling in wild type and RNA interference-mediated suppression lines deficient in ethylene production (acs2) or signaling (eil1) after challenge with M. oryzae as well as fungal cell-wall elicitors. Ethylene-insensitive mutant lines show an attenuated basal defense response including lower basal expression of the genes encoding a chitin-binding receptor, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of diterprenoid phytoalexins, a reduction on early hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death, and reduced incidence of callose deposition. Ethylene-deficient mutants showed an intermediate phenotype, with a significant reduction in expression of defense-related genes and callose deposition, but only a slight reduction in HR-like cell death. As a result, all ethylene-insensitive mutants show increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, whereas the ethylene-deficient lines show a slight but less significant increase in disease severity. These results show that ethylene signaling and, to some extent, ethylene production are required for rice basal resistance against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
27912109	Characterization and fine-mapping of a novel premature leaf senescence mutant yellow leaf and dwarf 1 in rice.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Leaves are the main organs in which photosynthates are produced. Leaf senescence facilitates the translocation of photosynthates and nutrients from source to sink, which is important for plant development and especially for crop yield. However, the molecular mechanism of leaf senescence is unknown. Here, we identified a mutant, yellow leaf and dwarf 1 (yld1), which exhibited decreased plant height and premature leaf senescence. Nitroblue tetrazolium and diamiobenzidine staining analyses revealed that the concentrations of reactive oxygen species were higher in yld1 leaves than in wild type leaves. The photosynthetic pigment contents were significantly decreased in yld1. The yld1 chloroplasts had collapsed and were filled with abnormal starch granules. Combining bulk segregant and MutMap gene mapping approaches, the mutation responsible for the yld1 phenotype was mapped to a 7.3 Mb centromeric region, and three non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms located in three novel genes were identified in this region. The expression patterns of the three candidate genes indicated that LOC_Os06g29380 had the most potential for functional verification. Plant hormone measurements showed that salicylic acid was highly accumulated in yld1 leaves when compared with wild type leaves, and yld1 was more sensitive to salicylic acid than wild type. This work lays the foundation for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanism of leaf senescence, and may reveal new connections among the molecular pathways related to leaf senescence, starch metabolism and salicylic acid signaling.
28049856	IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation.	2017	Plant Physiol	Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective barriers for pollen development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), few genes have been characterized in maize (Zea mays) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, irregular pollen exine1 (ipe1), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the IPE1 gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of IPE1 were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that ipe1 anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in ipe1 mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.
27815665	Electrophysiological and behavioral responses of female African rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzivora Harris and Gagné, to host plant volatiles.	2017	J Chem Ecol	African rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzivora Harris and Gagné, is a major pest of rice in Africa. Depsite its economic importance, its chemical ecology is not well understood. Here, we assessed behavioral and electrophysiological responses of O. oryzivora to host plant volatiles. In olfactometer bioassays, mated female O. oryzivora were attracted to volatiles emitted from intact rice plants but were repelled by volatiles collected from plants infested by conspecifics. In a choice test, there was a preference for volatiles from uninfested plants over those from infested plants. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography analyses of panicle volatiles isolated four electrophysiologically active components: (S)-linalool, 4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, (E)-caryophyllene, and (R/S)-(E)-nerolidol. A synthetic blend of volatiles at the same concentration and ratio as that from an intact plant was attractive to mated females, whereas a blend based on the ratio of volatiles from an infested plant was repellent. This suggests that O. oryzivora uses olfaction for host plant recognition. The identification of blends of volatiles emitted by plants that can both attract and repel O. oryzivora may aid the development of sustainable control measures.
27800704	Rice Plasma Membrane Proteomics Reveals Magnaporthe oryzae Promotes Susceptibility by Sequential Activation of Host Hormone Signaling Pathways.	2016	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plant plasma membrane (PM) plays important roles in immune response. Here, we utilized quantitative mass spectrometry to explore rice PM protein composition and dynamic changes during Magnaporthe oryzae infection. We report, thus far, the largest rice PM proteome dataset with 3,906 identified proteins, among which 484 proteins were differentially expressed after M. oryzae infection. One third of the identified proteins are predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain. Half of the identified proteins are predicted to have binding functions and over one third of the proteins have enzyme-related functions. In addition, Gene Ontology analyses revealed that abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) signaling were sequentially activated after M. oryzae infection in rice. We found that the activation of ABA signaling and the suppression of rice immune response occurred at the early infection stage, while the activation of CK signaling, the upregulation of sugar transporter genes expression, and the nutrient efflux of infected rice cells occurred at later infection stage. Thus, we further propose that M. oryzae activates ABA signaling to repress rice immune signaling for initial invasion and redirects nutrient efflux of infected cells for massive growth at the later infection stage.
27899926	Bioinformatic Analyses of Subgroup-A Members of the Wheat bZIP Transcription Factor Family and Functional Identification of <i>TabZIP174</i> Involved in Drought Stress Response.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Extensive studies in Arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that Subgroup-A members of the bZIP transcription factor family play important roles in plant responses to multiple abiotic stresses. Although common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world, there are limited investigations into Subgroup A of the bZIP family in wheat. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses of the 41 Subgroup-A members of the wheat bZIP family. Phylogenetic and conserved motif analyses showed that most of the Subgroup-A bZIP proteins involved in abiotic stress responses of wheat, Arabidopsis, and rice clustered in Clade A1 of the phylogenetic tree, and shared a majority of conserved motifs, suggesting the potential importance of Clade-A1 members in abiotic stress responses. Gene structure analysis showed that TabZIP genes with close phylogenetic relationships tended to possess similar exon-intron compositions, and the positions of introns in the hinge regions of the bZIP domains were highly conserved, whereas introns in the leucine zipper regions were at variable positions. Additionally, eleven groups of homologs and two groups of tandem paralogs were also identified in Subgroup A of the wheat bZIP family. Expression profiling analysis indicated that most Subgroup-A TabZIP genes were responsive to abscisic acid and various abiotic stress treatments. TabZIP27, TabZIP74, TabZIP138, and TabZIP174 proteins were localized in the nucleus of wheat protoplasts, whereas TabZIP9-GFP fusion protein was simultaneously present in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TabZIP174 displayed increased seed germination rates and primary root lengths under drought treatments. Overexpression of TabZIP174 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred enhanced drought tolerance, and transgenic plants exhibited lower water loss rates, higher survival rates, higher proline, soluble sugar, and leaf chlorophyll contents, as well as more stable osmotic potential under drought conditions. Additionally, overexpression of TabZIP174 increased the expression of stress-responsive genes (RD29A, RD29B, RAB18, DREB2A, COR15A, and COR47). The improved drought resistance might be attributed to the increased osmotic adjustment capacity. Our results indicate that TabZIP174 may participate in regulating plant response to drought stress and holds great potential for genetic improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
27761892	Integrated analysis of rice transcriptomic and metabolomic responses to elevated night temperatures identifies sensitivity- and tolerance-related profiles.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Transcript and metabolite profiling were performed on leaves from six rice cultivars under high night temperature (HNT) condition. Six genes were identified as central for HNT response encoding proteins involved in transcription regulation, signal transduction, protein-protein interactions, jasmonate response and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Sensitive cultivars showed specific changes in transcript abundance including abiotic stress responses, changes of cell wall-related genes, of ABA signaling and secondary metabolism. Additionally, metabolite profiles revealed a highly activated TCA cycle under HNT and concomitantly increased levels in pathways branching off that could be corroborated by enzyme activity measurements. Integrated data analysis using clustering based on one-dimensional self-organizing maps identified two profiles highly correlated with HNT sensitivity. The sensitivity profile included genes of the functional bins abiotic stress, hormone metabolism, cell wall, signaling, redox state, transcription factors, secondary metabolites and defence genes. In the tolerance profile, similar bins were affected with slight differences in hormone metabolism and transcription factor responses. Metabolites of the two profiles revealed involvement of GABA signaling, thus providing a link to the TCA cycle status in sensitive cultivars and of myo-inositol as precursor for inositol phosphates linking jasmonate signaling to the HNT response specifically in tolerant cultivars.
27805032	Understanding the immune system architecture and transcriptome responses to southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus in Sogatella furcifera.	2016	Sci Rep	Sogatella furcifera, the white-backed planthopper (WBPH), has become one of the most destructive pests in rice production owing to its plant sap-sucking behavior and efficient transmission of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) in a circulative, propagative and persistent manner. The dynamic and complex SRBSDV-WBPH-rice plant interaction is still poorly understood. In this study, based on a homology-based genome-wide analysis, 348 immune-related genes belonging to 28 families were identified in WBPH. A transcriptome analysis of non-viruliferous (NVF) and viruliferous groups with high viral titers (HVT) and median viral titers (MVT) revealed that feeding on SRBSDV-infected rice plants has a significant impact on gene expression, regardless of viral titers in insects. We identified 278 up-regulated and 406 down-regulated genes shared among the NVF, MVT, and HVT groups and detected significant down-regulation of primary metabolism-related genes and oxidoreductase. In viruliferous WBPH with viral titer-specific transcriptome changes, 1,906 and 1,467 genes exhibited strict monotonically increasing and decreasing expression, respectively. The RNAi pathway was the major antiviral response to increasing viral titers among diverse immune responses. These results clarify the responses of immune genes and the transcriptome of WBPH to SRBSDV and improve our knowledge of the functional relationship between pathogen, vector, and host.
27848980	Influence of leaf vein density and thickness on hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) during water stress.	2016	Sci Rep	The leaf venation architecture is an ideal, highly structured and efficient irrigation system in plant leaves. Leaf vein density (LVD) and vein thickness are the two major properties of this system. Leaf laminae carry out photosynthesis to harvest the maximum biological yield. It is still unknown whether the LVD and/or leaf vein thickness determines the plant hydraulic conductance (Kplant) and leaf photosynthetic rate (A). To investigate this topic, the current study was conducted with two varieties under three PEG-induced water deficit stress (PEG-IWDS) levels. The results showed that PEG-IWDS significantly decreased A, stomatal conductance (gs), and Kplant in both cultivars, though the IR-64 strain showed more severe decreases than the Hanyou-3 strain. PEG-IWDS significantly decreased the major vein thickness, while it had no significant effect on LVD. A, gs and Kplant were positively correlated with each other, and they were negatively correlated with LVD. A, gs and Kplant were positively correlated with the inter-vein distance and major vein thickness. Therefore, the decreased photosynthesis and hydraulic conductance in rice plants under water deficit conditions are related to the decrease in the major vein thickness.
27895202	The LBD12-1 Transcription Factor Suppresses Apical Meristem Size by Repressing Argonaute 10 Expression.	2017	Plant Physiol	The shoot apical meristem (SAM) consists of a population of multipotent cells that generates all aerial structures and regenerates itself. SAM maintenance and lateral organ development are regulated by several complex signaling pathways, in which the Argonaute gene-mediated pathway plays a key role. One Argonaute gene, AGO10, functions as a microRNA locker that attenuates miR165/166 activity and positively regulates shoot apical meristem development, but little is known about when and how AGO10 is regulated at the transcriptional level. In this work, we showed that transgenic rice plants overexpressing LBD12-1, an LBD family transcription factor, exhibited stunted growth, twisted leaves, abnormal anthers, and reduced SAM size. Further research revealed that LBD12-1 directly binds to the promoter region and represses the expression of AGO10. Overexpression of AGO10 in an LBD12-1 overexpression background rescued the growth defect phenotype of LBD12-1-overexpressing plants. The expression of LBD12-1 and its binding ability to the AGO10 promoter is induced by stress. lbd12-1 loss-of-function mutants showed similar phenotypes and SAM size to the wild type under normal conditions, but lbd12-1 had a larger SAM under salt stress. Our findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of AGO10 by which SAM size is controlled under stress conditions.
27819745	NJ cluster analysis of the SnRK2, PYR/PYL/RCAR, and ABF genes in Tibetan hulless barley.	2016	Genet Mol Res	The abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is known as one of the most important signaling pathways in plants and is mediated by multiple regulators. The genes SnRK2, PYR/PYL/RCAR, and ABF are relevant to both ABA-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. To elucidate the profile of these genes from Tibetan hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum Hook. f.), we collected available sequences from RNA-Seq data, together with NCBI data from five other model plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, and Sorghum bicolor). Gene trees of SnRK2, PYR/PYL/RCAR, and ABF were constructed using a neighbor joining (NJ) method. For all genes, we identified a dominant group in which all six species were represented. Three, four, and five groups were found in the NJ trees of SnRK2, PYR/PYL/RCAR, and ABF, respectively. For each gene, Tibetan hulless barley was divided into three groups. Our analyses indicated that Tibetan hulless barley was associated with B. distachyon. The NJ cluster analysis also suggested that Tibetan hulless barley was affiliated with S. bicolor (SnRK2), A. thaliana (PYR/PYL/RCAR), and O. sativa (ABF). These results illustrate a diverse expression of genes SnRK2, PYR/PYL/RCAR, and ABF, and suggest a relationship among the six species studied. Collectively, our characterization of the three components of the ABA signaling pathway may contribute to improve stress tolerance in Tibetan hulless barley.
27901104	Development and evaluation of near-isogenic lines for brown planthopper resistance in rice cv. 9311.	2016	Sci Rep	Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice in Asia. To date 29 BPH resistance genes have been identified, but only a few genes are being used in breeding due to inefficient markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and little knowledge of the real effects of the genes. In this study we individually transferred 13 genes or QTLs (Bph14, QBph3, QBph4, Bph17, Bph15, Bph20, Bph24, Bph6, Bph3, Bph9, Bph10, Bph18 and Bph21) into cultivar 9311 by marker assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Through positive and negative selection we narrowed the segments from donors containing Bph14, Bph15, Bph6 and Bph9 to 100-400 kb. Whole-genome background selection based on a high resolution SNP array was performed to maximize reconstitution of the recurrent parent genome (RPG 99.2-99.9%). All genes reduced BPH growth and development and showed antibiotic responses in seedlings. Based on genetic effects and amino acid sequences of genes in three clusters we inferred that Bph10 and Bph21 might be identical to Bph26, whereas Bph9 and Bph18 were different. Bph15 might be same with Bph17, but QBph4, Bph20 and Bph24 might be different. We believe that these NILs will be useful in rice BPH resistance research and breeding.
27810475	Novel insights into the regulatory roles of gene hshB in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	None	Res Microbiol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola causes leaf streak disease of rice. The gene hshB is a newly identified virulence-associated gene that is co-regulated by diffusible signal factor signaling and global regulator Clp in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Our previous study showed that mutation of hshB remarkably impaired the virulence, extracellular protease activity, extracellular polysaccharide production and resistance to oxidative stress of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. In this study, the regulatory role of hshB in X. oryzae pv .oryzicola was expanded. Results showed that hshB was also required for cell swimming motility. Transcriptome analysis showed that 305 genes were significantly differentially expressed after deletion of hshB in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Further analysis of transcriptome data indicated that the differentially expressed genes focused on two aspects: namely, cell motility and cell signal transduction. This finding strongly identified the closely related function of hshB to cell motility and signal transduction. In addition, the mutation of hshB of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola enhanced biofilm formation. Collectively, the study showed novel functions of gene hshB in cell motility and biofilm formation by transcriptome analysis, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of gene hshB in the pathogenic X. oryzae pv. oryzicola.
27664745	Biocontrol and plant growth promoting activities of a Streptomyces corchorusii strain UCR3-16 and preparation of powder formulation for application as biofertilizer agents for rice plant.	2016	Microbiol Res	Streptomyces corchorusii strain UCR3-16, obtained from rice rhizospheric soils showed antifungal activities against 6 major rice fungal pathogens by diffusible and volatile compounds production. The strain was found positive for production of fungal cell wall degrading enzymes such as chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, β-1,4-glucanase, lipase and protease. The strain was also positive for plant growth promoting traits. It produced up to 30.5μg/ml of IAA and solubilized a significant amount of inorganic phosphate (up to 102μg/ml). It also produced 69% siderophore units. The strain also produced ammonia and gave positive result for ACC deaminase activity. Highest vigor index of inoculated seedlings was observed when rice seeds were treated with cell suspension of UCR3-16 corresponding to 4.5×10(8)cfu/ml. Bioinoculant-treated seeds also showed similar results under pathogen challenged conditions. In pot trial experiments, UCR3-16-treated rice plants showed significantly increased growth and grain yield production. Powder formulation of the strain was developed using talcum and corn starch as carriers and the shelf-lives were monitored. Talcum formulation showed higher cell-count than corn starch even after 6 months of storage, and optimum condition for storage of the powder formulation were found to be at 4°C. Pot trial experiments using talcum powder formulation also showed significant positive effects on growth of rice plants. Field trial using talcum powder formulation also exhibited significant enhancement in shoot length and weight of shoot and root, and total grain yield and weight of grains in rice plants. Talcum formulation also significantly reduced the sheath blight disease in rice leaves.
27899667	Rice SNP-seek database update: new SNPs, indels, and queries.	2017	Nucleic Acids Res	We describe updates to the Rice SNP-Seek Database since its first release. We ran a new SNP-calling pipeline followed by filtering that resulted in complete, base, filtered and core SNP datasets. Besides the Nipponbare reference genome, the pipeline was run on genome assemblies of IR 64, 93-11, DJ 123 and Kasalath. New genotype query and display features are added for reference assemblies, SNP datasets and indels. JBrowse now displays BAM, VCF and other annotation tracks, the additional genome assemblies and an embedded VISTA genome comparison viewer. Middleware is redesigned for improved performance by using a hybrid of HDF5 and RDMS for genotype storage. Query modules for genotypes, varieties and genes are improved to handle various constraints. An integrated list manager allows the user to pass query parameters for further analysis. The SNP Annotator adds traits, ontology terms, effects and interactions to markers in a list. Web-service calls were implemented to access most data. These features enable seamless querying of SNP-Seek across various biological entities, a step toward semi-automated gene-trait association discovery. URL: http://snp-seek.irri.org.
27896932	Mesoionic insecticides: a novel class of insecticides that modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: As the world population grows towards 9 billion by 2050, it is projected that food production will need to increase by 60%. A critical part of this growth includes the safe and effective use of insecticides to reduce the estimated 20-49% loss of global crop yields owing to pests. The development of new insecticides will help to sustain this protection and overcome insecticide resistance.

RESULTS: A novel class of mesoionic compounds has been discovered, with exceptional insecticidal activity on a range of Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. These compounds bind to the orthosteric site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and result in a highly potent inhibitory action at the receptor with minimal agonism. The synthesis, biological activity, optimization and mode of action will be discussed.

CONCLUSION: Triflumezopyrim insect control will provide a powerful tool for control of hopper species in rice throughout Asia. Dicloromezotiaz can provide a useful control tool for lepidopteran pests, with an underexploited mode of action among these pests. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.
27838799	The far-upstream regulatory region of RFL is required for its precise spatial-temporal expression for floral development in rice.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: A rice mutant aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) was identified, showing increased floral organ number, aberrant floral organ identity and loss of floral meristem determinacy. A disruption of sequence integrity at 6292-bp upstream of RFL by a T-DNA insertion led to varied RFL expression patterns in floral meristem and floret in afo1 and caused the mutant phenotype. The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factor and its homologs affect many aspects of plant development, especially floral development. RICE FLORICAULA/LEAFY (RFL), the rice ortholog of LFY, has complicated expression patterns and different functions in floral development. However, the mechanisms regulating the spatial-temporal expression of RFL remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a rice aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) mutant that was produced by a T-DNA insertion at 6292-bp upstream of the start codon of RFL. This insertion altered the expression of RFL in floral meristem (FM) and floret. The in situ hybridization result showed that, when florets appear, RFL was expressed almost exclusively at the palea/lemma adaxial base adjacent to lodicules in the wild-type panicle. However, in afo1 florets, RFL mRNA signals were detected in the region between lodicule and stamen, and strong signals persisted in FM. The altered pattern of RFL expression in afo1 resulted in enlarged FMs, more floral organs, aberrant floral organ identity, and loss of FM determinacy. Transformation of rice with an RFL construct driven by the 6292-bp upstream genomic sequence re-built the mutant phenotype similar to afo1. The results suggest that the far-upstream region of RFL may contain potential cis element(s) that are critical to define the precise spatial-temporal expression pattern of RFL for its function in floral development.
27866313	Two MYB-related transcription factors play opposite roles in sugar signaling in Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: Sugar regulation of gene expression has profound effects at all stages of the plant life cycle. Although regulation at the transcriptional level is one of the most prominent mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated, only a few transcription factors have been identified and demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of sugar-regulated gene expression. OsMYBS1, an R1/2-type MYB transcription factor, has been demonstrated to be involved in sugar- and hormone-regulated α-amylase gene expression in rice. Arabidopsis contains two OsMYBS1 homologs. In the present study, we investigate MYBS1 and MYBS2 in sugar signaling in Arabidopsis. Our results indicate that MYBS1 and MYBS2 play opposite roles in regulating glucose and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis during seed germination and early seedling development. MYB proteins have been classified into four subfamilies: R2R3-MYB, R1/2-MYB, 3R-MYB, and 4R-MYB. An R1/2-type MYB transcription factor, OsMYBS1, has been demonstrated to be involved in sugar- and hormone-regulated α-amylase genes expression in rice. In this study, two genes homologous to OsMYBS1, MYBS1 and MYBS2, were investigated in Arabidopsis. Subcellular localization analysis showed that MYBS1 and MYBS2 were localized in the nucleus. Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that both MYBS1 and MYBS2 could recognize the sugar response element, TA-box, in the promoter and induced promoter activity. mybs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to glucose, whereas mybs2 seedlings were hyposensitive to it. MYBS1 and MYBS2 are involved in the control of glucose-responsive gene expression, as the mybs1 mutant displayed increased expression of a hexokinase gene (HXK1), chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene (CAB1), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene (APL3), and chalcone synthase gene (CHS), whereas the mybs2 mutant exhibited decreased expression of these genes. mybs1 also showed an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA) in the seed germination and seedling growth stages, while mybs2 showed reduced responses. The ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone rescued the mybs1 glucose-hypersensitive phenotype. Moreover, the mRNA levels of three ABA biosynthesis genes, ABA1, NCED9, and AAO3, and three ABA signaling genes, ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5, were increased upon glucose treatment of mybs1 seedlings, but were decreased in mybs2 seedlings. These results indicate that MYBS1 and MYBS2 play opposite roles in regulating glucose and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis during seed germination and early seedling development.
27879387	Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance.	2017	Plant Physiol	The crystallographic structure of a rice (Oryza sativa) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 Å resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.
27717449	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7.	2016	Plant Sci	Under long day (LD) lengths, flowering can be delayed in rice by modulating several regulatory genes. We found activation tagging lines that showed an early flowering phenotype preferentially under LD conditions. Expression of Rice outermost cell-specific gene 4 (Roc4), encoding a homeodomain Leu-zipper class IV family protein, was significantly increased. Transcript levels of Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) were significantly reduced while those of Ghd7 downstream genes were increased. However, other flowering regulators were unaffected. Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in 'Dongjin' japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in 'Longjing27' rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result. This confirmed that Roc4 regulates flowering time mainly through Ghd7. Phytochromes and O. sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI) function upstream of Roc4. Transgenic plants showed ubiquitous expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene under the Roc4 promoter. Furthermore, Roc4 had transcriptional activation activity in the N-terminal region of the StAR-related lipid-transfer domain. All of these findings are evidence that Roc4 is an LD-preferential flowering enhancer that functions downstream of phytochromes and OsGI, but upstream of Ghd7.
27923179	Structural dynamics of Casein Kinase I (CKI) from malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Isolate 3D7): Insights from theoretical modelling and molecular simulations.	2017	J Mol Graph Model	The protein kinases (PKs), belonging to serine/threonine kinase (STKs), are important drug targets for a wide spectrum of diseases in human. Among protein kinases, the Casein Kinases (CKs) are vastly expanded in various organisms, where, the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses a single member i.e., PfCKI, which can phosphorylate various proteins in parasite extracts in vitro condition. But, the structure-function relationship of PfCKI and dynamics of ATP binding is yet to be understood. Henceforth, an attempt was made to study the dynamics, stability, and ATP binding mechanisms of PfCKI through computational modelling, docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM/PBSA binding free energy estimation. Bi-lobed catalytic domain of PfCKI shares a high degree of secondary structure topology with CKI domains of rice, human, and mouse indicating co-evolution of these kinases. Molecular docking study revealed that ATP binds to the active site where the glycine-rich ATP-binding motif (G16-X-G18-X-X-G21) along with few conserved residues plays a crucial role maintaining stability of the complex. Structural superposition of PfCKI with close structural homologs depicted that the location and length of important loops are different, indicating the dynamic properties of these loops among CKIs, which is consistent with principal component analysis (PCA). PCA displayed that the overall global motion of ATP-bound form is comparatively higher than that of apo form. The present study provides insights into the structural features of PfCKI, which could contribute towards further understanding of related protein structures, dynamics of catalysis and phosphorylation mechanism in these important STKs from malarial parasite in near future.
27833163	Increase phosphorus availability from the use of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) green manure in rice (Oryza sativa L.) agroecosystem.	2016	Sci Rep	Alfalfa is a good green manure source, but its effect on rice growth has not been fully elucidated. Two green manure species, alfalfa and broad bean (Vicia faba L.), and two N fertilizer levels, alone or combination, were applied to a rice field. The results indicated that alfalfa had more pronounced effects on increasing soil labile phosphorus (P) fractions (including NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi), P uptake and soil enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, urease, acid phosphatase and β-glucosidase) than broad bean and N fertilizer. The transformation of NaHCO3-Po to labile P regulated by alfalfa played a significant direct and indirect effect on grain yield. Although a much lower N input from alfalfa addition, a similar grain yield with N fertilizer treatment was achieved, and the integration of alfalfa with N fertilizer produced the highest grain yield and P availability, which was associated with the highest urease, acid phosphatase and β-glucosidase activity in soil. These results indicate that alfalfa green manure had a great ability of increasing grain yield through enhancing P availability in rice paddy, which could give us a way to reduce N fertilizer application by enhancing P availability.
27804786	Heavy-ion beam mutagenesis identified an essential gene for chloroplast development under cold stress conditions during both early growth and tillering stages in rice.	2017	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We isolated a cold sensitive virescent1 (csv1) mutant from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) population mutagenized by carbon ion irradiation. The mutant exhibited chlorotic leaves during the early growth stages, and produced normal green leaves as it grew. The growth of csv1 plants displayed sensitivity to low temperatures. In addition, the mutant plants that were transferred to low temperatures at the fifth leaf stage produced chlorotic leaves subsequently. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed translocation of a 13-kb genomic fragment that disrupted the causative gene (CSV1; LOC_Os05g34040). CSV1 encodes a plastid-targeted oxidoreductase-like protein conserved among land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Furthermore, CSV1 transcripts were more abundant in immature than in mature leaves, and they did not markedly increase or decrease with temperature. Taken together, our results indicate that CSV1 supports chloroplast development under cold stress conditions, in both the early growth and tillering stages in rice.
27881726	Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis.	2017	Plant Physiol	A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 indica rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of Granule Bound Starch Synthase I was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.
27823898	RNAi in the striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, establishes a functional role for aminopeptidase N in Cry1Ab intoxication.	2017	J Invertebr Pathol	The striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, is a major target pest of transgenic rice expressing the Cry1Ab protein from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in China. Evolution of resistance in this pest is a major threat to the durability of Bt rice. Since Bt exerts its activity through binding to specific receptors in the midgut of target insects, identification of functional Cry1Ab receptors in the midgut of C. suppressalis larvae is crucial to evaluate potential resistance mechanisms and develop effective strategies for delaying insect resistance. In this work, we identified the putative Cry1Ab toxin-binding protein, aminopeptidase-N (APN), in the midgut of C. suppressalis by ligand blot and mass spectrometry. After cloning the full-length cDNAs encoding APN isoforms from the C. suppressalis larval midgut, we studied their spatiotemporal expression in different gut tissues and developmental stages. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) against C. suppressalis aminopeptidases (CsAPNs) was employed to illustrate a functional role for CsAPNs in Cry1Ab toxicity to C. suppressalis larvae using injection and oral delivery of Stealth™ siRNA. Down-regulating the expression of CsAPNs by RNAi was closely associated with reduced susceptibility of C. suppressalis to Cry1Ab. These data provide the first direct evidence that CsAPNs participate in the mode of Cry1Ab action and may act as the functional receptor of Cry1A in C. suppressalis larvae.
27717459	The down-regulation of the genes encoding Isoamylase 1 alters the starch composition of the durum wheat grain.	2016	Plant Sci	In rice, maize and barley, the lack of Isoamylase 1 activity materially affects the composition of endosperm starch. Here, the effect of this deficiency in durum wheat has been characterized, using transgenic lines in which Isa1 was knocked down via RNAi. Transcriptional profiling confirmed the partial down-regulation of Isa1 and revealed a pleiotropic effect on the level of transcription of genes encoding other isoamylases, pullulanase and sucrose synthase. The polysaccharide content of the transgenic endosperms was different from that of the wild type in a number of ways, including a reduction in the content of starch and a moderate enhancement of both phytoglycogen and β-glucan. Some alterations were also induced in the distribution of amylopectin chain length and amylopectin fine structure. The amylopectin present in the transgenic endosperms was more readily hydrolyzable after a treatment with hydrochloric acid, which disrupted its semi-crystalline structure. The conclusion was that in durum wheat, Isoamylase 1 is important for both the synthesis of amylopectin and for determining its internal structure.
27867151	Genetic analysis and gene mapping of the glabrous leaf and hull mutant glr3 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Yi Chuan	We obtained a glabrous leaf and hull mutant from a population of radiation mutagenesis of an indica rice cultivar R401. The mutant produced smooth leaves and hairless glumes under normal growth conditions. An F2 population was developed from a cross between a japonica cultivar Nipponbare and the glabrous leaf and hull mutant. By investigating the performance of the F2 population, we found that the mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated GLR3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on the F2 mapping population revealed that GLR3 is located on chromosome 6. By analyzing 417 typical glabrous leaf F2 plants using molecular markers, GLR3 was mapped to a 0.2 cM interval between InDel markers ID27101 and ID27199, and the physical distance between the two markers is 98 kb. Thus we have mapped the gene GLR3, and our work will provide basis for future mechanistic analysis of GLR3 function.
27898176	Structure-function analyses of the Pth11 receptor reveal an important role for CFEM motif and redox regulation in rice blast.	2017	New Phytol	The interaction of Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, and rice begins when M. oryzae establishes contact with the host plant surface. On perception of appropriate surface signals, M. oryzae forms appressoria and initiates host invasion. Pth11, an important G-protein-coupled receptor necessary for appressorium formation in M. oryzae, contains seven transmembrane regions and a CFEM (common in several fungal extracellular membrane proteins) domain with the characteristic eight cysteine residues. We focused on gaining further insight into the role of the CFEM domain in the putative surface sensing/response function of Pth11. Increased/constitutive expression of CFEM resulted in precocious, albeit defective, appressoria formation in wild-type M. oryzae. The Pth11C63A/C65A mutant, probably with disrupted disulfide bonds in the CFEM, showed delayed appressorium formation and reduced virulence. Furthermore, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found to be altered in the pth11Δ strain. Strikingly, antioxidant treatment induced appressorium formation in pth11Δ. The Gα subunit MagB and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Pmk1 were required for the formation of antioxidant-induced appressoria. We conclude that the CFEM domain of Pth11 is required for proper development of the appressoria, appressoria-like structures and pathogenicity. Highly regulated ROS homeostasis is important for Pth11-mediated appressorium formation in M. oryzae.
27825968	The wheat MYB transcription factor TaMYB18 regulates leaf rolling in rice.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding. Moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency. Although some genes controlling leaf rolling have been isolated from rice and other plant species, few studies have examined leaf rolling in wheat. In the present study, the leaf rolling regulator gene, TaMYB18, was identified in a large-scale transgene project involving the transformation of 1455 wheat transcription factor genes into rice. Three homologous sequences of TaMYB18 were isolated from hexaploid wheat and localized to chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, respectively. TaMYB18, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, localized to the nucleus. TaMYB18 overexpression induced leaf rolling in transgenic rice. Additionally, the three members of TaMYB18 exhibited functional redundancy in rice. Furthermore, the function of TaMYB18 in regulating leaf rolling in rice was a dose-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that TaMYB18 may play an important role in the regulation of leaf development.
27848097	Transcription dynamics of Saltol QTL localized genes encoding transcription factors, reveals their differential regulation in contrasting genotypes of rice.	2017	Funct Integr Genomics	Salinity is one of the major environmental factors affecting the growth and yield of rice crop. Salinity stress response is a multigenic trait and numerous approaches have been used to dissect out the key determinants of complex salt tolerance trait and their regulation in plant. In the current study, we have investigated expression dynamics of the genes encoding transcription factors (SalTFs) localized within a major salinity tolerance related QTL-'Saltol' in the contrasting cultivars of rice. SalTFs were found to be differentially regulated between the contrasting genotypes of rice, with higher constitutive expression in the salt tolerant landrace, Pokkali than the cultivar IR64. Moreover, SalTFs were found to exhibit inducibility in the salt sensitive cultivar at late duration (after 24 h) of salinity stress. Further, the transcript abundance analysis of these SalTFs at various developmental stages of rice revealed that low expressing genes may be involved in developmental responses, while high expressing genes can be linked with the salt stress response. Grouping of these genes was well supported by in silico protein-protein interaction studies and distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) in the promoter and genic regions of these genes. Taken together, we propose that out of 14 SalTFs, eight members are strongly correlated with the salinity stress tolerance in rice and six are involved in plant growth and development.
27900724	Suppression of OsVPE3 Enhances Salt Tolerance by Attenuating Vacuole Rupture during Programmed Cell Death and Affects Stomata Development in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) are cysteine proteinases that act as crucial mediators of programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. In rice, however, the role of VPEs in abiotic stress-induced PCD remains largely unknown. In this study, we generated OsVPE3 overexpression and suppression transgenic lines to elucidate the function of this gene in rice.

RESULTS: Survival rate and chlorophyll retention analyses showed that suppression of OsVPE3 clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance in transgenic rice compared with wild type. Furthermore, fragmentation of genomic DNA was inhibited in plants with down-regulated OsVPE3. Vital staining studies indicated that vacuole rupture occurred prior to plasma membrane collapse during salt-induced PCD. Notably, overexpression of OsVPE3 promoted vacuole rupture, whereas suppression of OsVPE3 attenuated or delayed the disintegration of vacuolar membranes. Moreover, we found that suppression of OsVPE3 caused decreased leaf width and guard cell length in rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicated that suppression of OsVPE3 enhances salt tolerance by attenuating vacuole rupture during PCD. Therefore, we concluded that OsVPE3 plays a crucial role in vacuole-mediated PCD and in stomatal development in rice.
27891171	A rapid approach to investigate spatiotemporal distribution of phytohormones in rice.	2016	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Phytohormones play crucial roles in almost all stages of plant growth and development. Accurate and simultaneous determination of multiple phytohormones enabled us to better understand the physiological functions and the regulatory networks of phytohormones. However, simultaneous determination of multiple phytohormones in plant is still a challenge due to their low concentrations, structural and chemical diversity, and complex matrix of plant tissues. Therefore, development of a simple and selective method for the simultaneous determination of multiple phytohormones is highly needed.

RESULTS: We developed a clean-up strategy for profiling of multiple phytohormones, which can overcome the challenge of structural and chemical diversity. By using a one-step dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) combined with UPLC-MS/MS, 54 phytohormones including auxins, ABA, SA, JA, GAs and CKs were simultaneously analyzed from a single rice sample extract. Using the developed method, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of phytohormones in rice. The profiling of various tissues of rice at different growth stages revealed the complexity of metabolic regulation and allocations of phytohormone species.

CONCLUSION: A rapid one-step method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of six groups of phytohormones, including cytokinins, auxins, salicylic acid, jasmonates, abscisic acid and gibberellins in a single run, using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The proposed method was successfully applied to investigate spatiotemporal distribution of multiple phytohormones in rice. The spatiotemporal information obtained may be helpful for better understanding of phytohormones functions throughout life cycle of rice when integrated into transcriptome and other omics data.
27817054	Effects of co-overexpression of the genes of Rubisco and transketolase on photosynthesis in rice.	2017	Photosynth Res	Metabolome analyses have indicated an accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate in transgenic rice plants with overproduction of Rubisco (Suzuki et al. in Plant Cell Environ 35:1369-1379, 2012. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02494.x ). Since Rubisco overproduction did not quantitatively enhance photosynthesis even under CO2-limited conditions, it is suspected that such an accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate hampers the improvement of photosynthetic capacity. In the present study, the gene of transketolase, which is involved in the metabolism of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, was co-overexpressed with the Rubisco small subunit gene in rice. Rubisco and transketolase were successfully overproduced in comparison with those in wild-type plants by 35-53 and 39-84 %, respectively. These changes in the amounts of the proteins were associated with those of the mRNA levels. However, the rate of CO2 assimilation under high irradiance and different [CO2] did not differ between co-overexpressed plants and wild-type plants. Thus, co-overproduction of Rubisco and transketolase did not improve photosynthesis in rice. Transketolase was probably not a limiting factor of photosynthesis as overproduction of transketolase alone by 80-94 % did not affect photosynthesis.
27797723	Effects of Hd2 in the presence of the photoperiod-insensitive functional allele of Hd1 in rice.	2016	Biol Open	The role of photoperiod sensitivity (PS) of flowering genes have become well recognized in rice, whereas little attention has been drawn to the non-PS component of these genes, especially to their influence on gene-by-gene interactions. Rice populations in which the photoperiod-sensitive allele at Hd1 has become insensitive to photoperiod but continued to affect heading date (HD) were used in this study to fine-map a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for HD and analyze its genetic relationship to Hd1 The QTL was delimitated to a 96.3-kb region on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 7. Sequence comparison revealed that this QTL is identical to Hd2 In the near-isogenic line (NIL) populations analyzed, Hd1 and Hd2 were shown to be photoperiod insensitive and have pleiotropic effects for HD, plant height and yield traits. The two genes were found to largely act additively in regulating HD and yield traits. The results indicate that non-PS components of flowering genes involved in photoperiod response play an important role in controlling flowering time and grain yield in rice, which should allow breeders to better manipulate pleiotropic genes for balancing adaptability and high-yielding accumulation.
27811002	Efficient acquisition of iron confers greater tolerance to saline-alkaline stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	J Exp Bot	To elucidate the mechanisms underlying tolerance to saline-alkaline stress in two rice genotypes, Dongdao-4 and Jigeng-88, we exposed them to medium supplemented with 10 mM Na2CO3 and 40 mM NaCl (pH 8.5). Dongdao-4 plants displayed higher biomass, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rates, and a larger root system than Jigeng-88 under saline-alkaline conditions. Dongdao-4 had a higher shoot Na+/K+ ratio than Jigeng-88 under both control and saline-alkaline conditions. Dongdao-4 exhibited stronger rhizospheric acidification than Jigeng-88 under saline-alkaline conditions, resulting from greater up-regulation of H+-ATPases at the transcriptional level. Moreover, Fe concentrations in shoots and roots of Dongdao-4 were higher than those in Jigeng-88, and a higher rate of phytosiderophore exudation was detected in Dongdao-4 versus Jigeng-88 under saline-alkaline conditions. The Fe-deficiency-responsive genes OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL2, and OsYSL15 were more strongly up-regulated in Dongdao-4 than Jigeng-88 plants in saline-alkaline medium, implying greater tolerance of Dongdao-4 plants to Fe deficiency. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of Fe deficiency on the two genotypes, and found that Dongdao-4 was more tolerant to Fe deficiency. Exposure to Fe-deficient medium led to greater rhizospheric acidification and phytosiderophore exudation in Dongdao-4 than Jigeng-88 plants. Expression levels of OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL2, and OsYSL15 were higher in Dongdao-4 than Jigeng-88 plants under Fe-deficient conditions. These results demonstrate that a highly efficient Fe acquisition system together with a large root system may underpin the greater tolerance of Dongdao-4 plants to saline-alkaline stress.
27833097	Exploitation of heterosis loci for yield and yield components in rice using chromosome segment substitution lines.	2016	Sci Rep	We constructed 128 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), derived from a cross between indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) 9311 and japonica rice Nipponbare, to investigate the genetic mechanism of heterosis. Three photo-thermo-sensitive-genic male sterile lines (Guangzhan63-4s, 036s, and Lian99s) were selected to cross with each CSSL to produce testcross populations (TCs). Field experiments were carried out in 2009, 2011, and 2015 to evaluate yield and yield-related traits in the CSSLs and TCs. Four traits (plant height, spikelet per panicle, thousand-grain weight, and grain yield per plant) were significantly related between CSSLs and TCs. In the TCs, plant height, panicle length, seed setting rate, thousand-grain weight, and grain yield per plant showed partial dominance, indicating that dominance largely contributes to heterosis of these five traits. While overdominance may be more important for heterosis of panicles per plant and spikelet per panicle. Based on the bin-maps of CSSLs and TCs, we detected 62 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 97 heterotic loci (HLs) using multiple linear regression analyses. Some of these loci were clustered together. The identification of QTLs and HLs for yield and yield-related traits provide useful information for hybrid rice breeding, and help to uncover the genetic basis of rice heterosis.
27838598	Evaluation of effectiveness of seed priming with selenium in rice during germination under arsenic stress.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	Due to extensive use of arsenic (As) contaminated ground water in rice cultivation As toxicity has become a growing concern to rice growers of south east Asian countries. The presence of As in soil and irrigation water causes impaired crop growth and development. Selenium (Se) at lower concentration (1.0 mg L-1) is reported to be stimulatory on crop growth and it has also an antagonistic behavior with As. With this rationale the present study was conducted to investigate into the potentiality of seed priming technology with Se to ameliorate the As stress on rice seed germination and seedling growth. The seed germination percentage, seedling growth, total phenolics, proline and malonaldehyde content as well as total As uptake pattern of rice seedlings grown under As stressed condition were measured. The As induced toxicity markedly reduced the germination percentage by 70%, whereas, Se supplementation through seed priming enhanced the rice seed germination by 9% and root and shoot length vis-a-vis seedling biomass accumulation by 1.3, 1.6 and 1.4 fold respectively. The inhibitory effect of As stress was more on root growth than that of shoot. The toxicity due to arsenite stress was higher than the arsenate stress. Seed priming with Se enhanced seed germination and seedling growth by reducing As uptake, suppressing the oxidative damage through increase in antioxidants accumulation in rice seedlings. Seed primed with 0.8 mg Se L-1 was more effective in improving rice seed germination and seedling growth, compared to 1.0 mg Se L-1.
27872632	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	2016	Front Plant Sci	NACs are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) involved in multiple aspects of development and stress. In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels. They exhibit significantly strong association with seed size/weight with the sequence variations located in the upstream regulatory region. Concomitantly, their expression pattern/levels during seed development vary amongst different accessions with variation in seed size. The alterations in the promoter sequences of the three genes, amongst the five rice accessions, correlate with the expression levels to a certain extent only. In terms of transcriptional properties, the three NAC TFs can activate and/or suppress downstream genes, though to different extents. Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively. Interestingly, these two proteins interact with ONAC026 and the dimers localize in the nucleus. Trans-splicing between ONAC020 and ONAC026 results in three additional forms of ONAC020. The transcriptional properties including activation, repression, subcellular localization and heterodimerization of trans-spliced forms of ONAC020 and ONAC026 are different, indicating toward their role as competitors. The analysis presented in this paper helps to conclude that the three NAC genes, which are associated with seed size, have independent as well as overlapping roles during the process and can be exploited as potential targets for crop improvement.
27895653	Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of the Tubby-Like Protein Family in the <i>Malus domestica</i> Genome.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Tubby-like proteins (TLPs), which have a highly conserved β barrel tubby domain, have been found to be associated with some animal-specific characteristics. In the plant kingdom, more than 10 TLP family members were identified in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and they were found to be involved in responses to stress. The publication of the apple genome makes it feasible to systematically study the TLP family in apple. In this investigation, nine TLP encoding genes (TLPs for short) were identified. When combined with the TLPs from other plant species, the TLPs were divided into three groups (group A, B, and C). Most plant TLP members in group A contained an additional F-box domain at the N-terminus. However, no common domain was identified other than tubby domain either in group B or in group C. An analysis of the tubby domains of MdTLPs identified three types of conserved motifs. Motif 1 and 2, the signature motifs in the confirmed TLPs, were always present in MdTLPs, while motif 3 was absent from group B. Homology modeling indicated that the tubby domain of most MdTLPs had a closed β barrel, as in animal tubby domains. Expression profiling revealed that the MdTLP genes were expressed in multiple organs and were abundant in roots, stems, and leaves but low in flowers. An analysis of cis-acting elements showed that elements related to the stress response were prevalent in the promoter sequences of MdTLPs. Expression profiling by qRT-PCR indicated that almost all MdTLPs were up-regulated at some extent under abiotic stress, exogenous ABA and H2O2 treatments in leaves and roots, though different MdTLP members exhibited differently in leaves and roots. The results and information above may provide a basis for further investigation of TLP function in plants.
27834403	Erratum: Map-based Cloning and Characterization of the BPH18 Gene from Wild Rice Conferring Resistance to Brown Planthopper (BPH) Insect Pest.	2016	Sci Rep	
27840573	A Multilayered Screening Method for the Identification of Regulatory Genes in Rice by Agronomic Traits.	2016	Evol Bioinform Online	We developed a multilayered screening method that integrates both genome and transcriptome data to effectively identify regulatory genes in rice (Oryza sativa). We tested our method using eight rice accessions that differed in three important nutritional and agricultural traits, anthocyanin biosynthesis, amylose content, and heading date. In the genome resequencing of eight rice accessions with 24 RNA sequencing experiments, 98% of the preprocessed reads could be uniquely mapped to the reference genome, resulting in the identification of 42,699 unique transcripts. Comparison between black and white rice cultivars showed evidence of intensive selective sweeps in chromosomes 3, 10, and 12. A total of 131 genes were differentially expressed among the black rice cultivars and found to be associated with three Gene Ontology terms (secondary metabolic process, biosynthetic process, and response to stimulus). We identified nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) that likely play an important role in determining the agronomic traits differences, two upregulated and three downregulated genes in the black cultivars, and two downregulated genes in the white cultivars. The three agronomic traits were clearly grouped together by the developmental stages, regardless of any other traits, suggesting that the developmental stage is the most important factor that triggers global changes in gene expression. Interestingly, glutinous and nonglutinous black rice cultivars were distinguished from one another by different heading dates.
27861933	A single base change explains the independent origin of and selection for the nonshattering gene in African rice domestication.	2017	New Phytol	Reduced seed shattering was a critical evolutionary step in crop domestication. Two cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, were independently domesticated from the wild species Oryza rufipogon in Asia and Oryza barthii in Africa, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the c gene, which encodes a trihelix transcription factor, causes nonshattering in O. sativa. However, the genetic mechanism of nonshattering in O. glaberrima is poorly understood. We conducted an association analysis for the coding sequences of SH3/SH4 in AA- genome rice species and the mutation suggested to cause nonshattering was demonstrated to do so using a positional-cloning approach in the O. sativa genetic background. We found that the loss of seed shattering in O. glaberrima was caused by an SNP resulting in a truncated SH3/SH4 protein. This mutation appears to be endemic and to have spread in the African gene pool by hybridization with some O. barthii accessions. We showed that interaction between the O. sativa and O. glaberrima domestication alleles of SH3 in heterozygotes induces a 'throwback' seed-shattering phenotype similar to that in the wild species. Identification of the causative SNP provides new insights into the molecular basis of seed shattering in crops and may facilitate investigation of the history of African rice domestication.
27833841	Plant growth-promotion and biofortification of chickpea and pigeonpea through inoculation of biocontrol potential bacteria, isolated from organic soils.	2016	Springerplus	Seven strains of bacteria [Pseudomonas plecoglossicida SRI-156, Brevibacterium antiquum SRI-158, Bacillus altitudinis SRI-178, Enterobacter ludwigii SRI-211, E. ludwigii SRI-229, Acinetobacter tandoii SRI-305 and Pseudomonas monteilii SRI-360; demonstrated previously for control of charcoal rot disease in sorghum and plant growth-promotion (PGP) in rice] were evaluated for their PGP and biofortification traits in chickpea and pigeonpea under field conditions. When treated on seed, the seven selected bacteria significantly enhanced the shoot height and root length of both chickpea and pigeonpea over the un-inoculated control. Under field conditions, in both chickpea and pigeonpea, the plots inoculated with test bacteria enhanced the nodule number, nodule weight, root and shoot weights, pod number, pod weight, leaf weight, leaf area and grain yield over the un-inoculated control plots. Among the seven bacteria, SRI-229 was found to significantly and consistently enhance all the studied PGP and yield traits including nodule number (24 and 36%), nodule weight (11 and 44%), shoot weight (22 and 20%), root weight (23 and 16%) and grain yield (19 and 26%) for both chickpea and pigeonpea, respectively. When the harvested grains were evaluated for their mineral contents, iron (up to 18 and 12%), zinc (up to 23 and 5%), copper (up to 19 and 8%), manganese (up to 2 and 39%) and calcium (up to 22 and 11%) contents in chickpea and pigeonpea, respectively, were found enhanced in test bacteria inoculated plots over the un-inoculated control plots. This study further confirms that the selected bacterial isolates not only have the potential for PGP in cereals and legumes but also have the potential for biofortification of mineral nutrients.
27737708	Study of arsenic accumulation in rice and evaluation of protective effects of Chorchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic contaminated rice induced toxicities in Wistar albino rats.	2016	BMC Pharmacol Toxicol	BACKGROUND: In the present study, we investigated the arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice irrigated with arsenic contaminated water. Besides, we also evaluated the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic contaminated rice induced toxicities in animal model.

METHODS: A pot experiment was conducted with arsenic amended irrigation water (0.0, 25.0, 50.0 and 75.0 mg/L As) to investigate the arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice. In order to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves, twenty Wistar albino rats were divided into four different groups. The control group (Group-I) was supplied with normal laboratory pellets while groups II, III, and IV received normal laboratory pellets supplemented with arsenic contaminated rice, C. olitorius leaf powder (4 %), arsenic contaminated rice plus C. olitorius leaf powder (4 %) respectively. Different haematological parameters and serum indices were analyzed to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic intoxication. To gather more supportive evidences of Corchorus olitorius potentiality against arsenic intoxication, histopathological analysis of liver, kidney, spleen and heart tissues was also performed.

RESULTS: From the pot experiment, we have found a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase of arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice with the increase of arsenic concentrations in irrigation water and the trend of accumulation was found as root > straw > husk > grain. Another part of the experiment revealed that supplementation of C. olitorius leaves with arsenic contaminated rice significantly (p < 0.05) restored the altered haematological parameters and other serum indices towards the normal values. Arsenic deposition pattern on different organs and histological studies on the ultrastructural changes of liver, kidneys, spleen and heart also supported the protective roles of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic contaminated rice induced toxicities.

CONCLUSION: Arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice increased dose-dependently. Hence, for irrigation purpose arsenic contaminated water cannot be used. Furthermore, arsenic contaminated rice induced several toxicities in animal model, most of which could be minimized with the food supplementation of Corchorus olitorius leaves. Therefore, Corchorus olitorius can be used as a potential food supplement to the affected people of arsenic prone zone to ensure the food security.
27595571	Identification of an H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> permeable PIP aquaporin in barley and a serine residue promoting H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> transport.	2017	Physiol Plant	A barley (Hordeum vulgare) plasma membrane type aquaporin, HvPIP2;5, was identified as an H2 O2 permeable aquaporin among 21 barley and rice PIPs examined in the heterologous expression system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four TIPs were also detected as H2 O2 -transporting aquaporins among 15 barley and rice TIPs. Influx of H2 O2 into yeast cells expressing HvPIP2;5 was determined with a florescent-dye-based assay. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that the expression of HvPIP2;5 protein was ubiquitous in root tissues, and was also weakly observed in leaf epidermal cells and cells in the vascular bundle. Point mutated variants of HvPIP2;5 were generated by the site-directed mutagenesis. Growth assays of yeast cells expressing these mutated HvPIP2;5 proteins suggested that Ser-126 in HvPIP2;5 has a large impact on H2 O2 transport with a minor influence on the HvPIP2;5-mediated water transport.
27697785	A flow cytometric method for estimating S-phase duration in plants.	2016	J Exp Bot	The duration of the DNA synthesis stage (S phase) of the cell cycle is fundamental in our understanding of cell cycle kinetics, cell proliferation, and DNA replication timing programs. Most S-phase duration estimates that exist for plants are based on indirect measurements. We present a method for directly estimating S-phase duration by pulse-labeling root tips or actively dividing suspension cells with the halogenated thymidine analog 5-ethynl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and analyzing the time course of replication with bivariate flow cytometry. The transition between G1 and G2 DNA contents can be followed by measuring the mean DNA content of EdU-labeled S-phase nuclei as a function of time after the labeling pulse. We applied this technique to intact root tips of maize (Zea mays L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and to actively dividing cell cultures of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) and rice. Estimates of S-phase duration in root tips were remarkably consistent, varying only by ~3-fold, although the genome sizes of the species analyzed varied >40-fold.
27765484	Sequencing and comparative analyses of Aegilops tauschii chromosome arm 3DS reveal rapid evolution of Triticeae genomes.	2017	J Genet Genomics	Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is an allohexaploid species derived from two rounds of interspecific hybridizations. A high-quality genome sequence assembly of diploid Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the wheat D genome, will provide a useful platform to study polyploid wheat evolution. A combined approach of BAC pooling and next-generation sequencing technology was employed to sequence the minimum tiling path (MTP) of 3176 BAC clones from the short arm of Ae. tauschii chromosome 3 (At3DS). The final assembly of 135 super-scaffolds with an N50 of 4.2 Mb was used to build a 247-Mb pseudomolecule with a total of 2222 predicted protein-coding genes. Compared with the orthologous regions of rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum, At3DS contains 38.67% more genes. In comparison to At3DS, the short arm sequence of wheat chromosome 3B (Ta3BS) is 95-Mb large in size, which is primarily due to the expansion of the non-centromeric region, suggesting that transposable element (TE) bursts in Ta3B likely occurred there. Also, the size increase is accompanied by a proportional increase in gene number in Ta3BS. We found that in the sequence of short arm of wheat chromosome 3D (Ta3DS), there was only less than 0.27% gene loss compared to At3DS. Our study reveals divergent evolution of grass genomes and provides new insights into sequence changes in the polyploid wheat genome.
27702995	A rhamnose-deficient lipopolysaccharide mutant of Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 is defective in root colonization and beneficial interactions with its flooding-tolerant hosts Sesbania cannabina and wetland rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 develops a classical nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with the aquatic legume Sesbania cannabina (Retz.). It also promotes the growth of wetland rice (Oryza sativa L.), but little is known about the rhizobial determinants important for these interactions. In this study, we analyzed the colonization of S. cannabina and rice using a strain of Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 dually marked with β-glucuronidase and the green fluorescent protein. This bacterium colonized S. cannabina by crack entry and through root hair infection under flooded and non-flooded conditions, respectively. Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 colonized the surfaces of wetland rice roots, but also entered them at the base of lateral roots. It became endophytically established within intercellular spaces in the rice cortex, and intracellularly within epidermal and hypodermal cells. A mutant of Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 altered in the synthesis of the rhamnose-containing O-antigen exhibited significant defects, not only in nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation with S. cannabina, but also in rice colonization and plant growth promotion. Supplementation with purified lipopolysaccharides from the wild-type strain, but not from the mutant, restored the beneficial colonization of rice roots, but not fully effective nodulation of S. cannabina Commonalities and differences in the rhizobial colonization of the roots of wetland legume and rice hosts are discussed.
27739910	Full-length sequence assembly reveals circular RNAs with diverse non-GT/AG splicing signals in rice.	2017	RNA Biol	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in diverse eukaryotic species and are characterized by RNA backsplicing events. Current available methods for circRNA identification are able to determine the start and end locations of circRNAs in the genome but not their full-length sequences. In this study, we developed a method to assemble the full-length sequences of circRNAs using the backsplicing RNA-Seq reads and their corresponding paired-end reads. By applying the method to an rRNA-depleted/RNase R-treated RNA-Seq dataset, we for the first time identified full-length sequences of nearly 3,000 circRNAs in rice. We further showed that alternative circularization of circRNA is a common feature in rice and, surprisingly, found that the junction sites of a large number of rice circRNAs are flanked by diverse non-GT/AG splicing signals while most human exonic circRNAs are flanked by canonical GT/AG splicing signals. Our study provides a method for genome-wide identification of full-length circRNAs and expands our understanding of splicing signals of circRNAs.
27729470	Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5'UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants.	2016	Plant Physiol	Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed carotene. While PSY constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), predominantly possess a single PSY gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5'UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5'UTR (untranslated region) and is involved in developmentally regulated carotenoid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5'UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the carotenoid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5'UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the translational activity in response to high carotenoid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5'UTR stretch with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux sensor. The translation-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5'UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass translational inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The mechanism is not found in the rice (Oryza sativa) PSY1 5'UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control mechanisms in taxa with multiple PSY genes. The translational control mechanism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the plastid-localized carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.
27747971	Discovery of rice essential genes by characterizing a CRISPR-edited mutation of closely related rice MAP kinase genes.	2017	Plant J	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system depends on a guide RNA (gRNA) to specify its target. By efficiently co-expressing multiple gRNAs that target different genomic sites, the polycistronic tRNA-gRNA gene (PTG) strategy enables multiplex gene editing in the family of closely related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) genes in Oryza sativa (rice). In this study, we identified MPK1 and MPK6 (Arabidopsis AtMPK6 and AtMPK4 orthologs, respectively) as essential genes for rice development by finding the preservation of MPK functional alleles and normal phenotypes in CRISPR-edited mutants. The true knock-out mutants of MPK1 were severely dwarfed and sterile, and homozygous mpk1 seeds from heterozygous parents were defective in embryo development. By contrast, heterozygous mpk6 mutant plants completely failed to produce homozygous mpk6 seeds. In addition, the functional importance of specific MPK features could be evaluated by characterizing CRISPR-induced allelic variation in the conserved kinase domain of MPK6. By simultaneously targeting between two and eight genomic sites in the closely related MPK genes, we demonstrated 45-86% frequency of biallelic mutations and the successful creation of single, double and quadruple gene mutants. Indels and fragment deletion were both stably inherited to the next generations, and transgene-free mutants of rice MPK genes were readily obtained via genetic segregation, thereby eliminating any positional effects of transgene insertions. Taken together, our study reveals the essentiality of MPK1 and MPK6 in rice development, and enables the functional discovery of previously inaccessible genes or domains with phenotypes masked by lethality or redundancy.
27701737	Isolation and functional characterization of CsLsi1, a silicon transporter gene in Cucumis sativus.	2017	Physiol Plant	Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely grown cucurbitaceous vegetable that exhibits a relatively high capacity for silicon (Si) accumulation, but the molecular mechanism for silicon uptake remains to be clarified. Here we isolated and characterized CsLsi1, a gene encoding a silicon transporter in cucumber (cv. Mch-4). CsLsi1 shares 55.70 and 90.63% homology with the Lsi1s of a monocot and dicot, rice (Oryza sativa) and pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata), respectively. CsLsi1 was predominantly expressed in the roots, and application of exogenous silicon suppressed its expression. Transient expression in cucumber protoplasts showed that CsLsi1 was localized in the plasma membrane. Heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that CsLsi1 evidenced influx transport activity for silicon but not urea or glycerol. Expression of cucumber CsLsi1-mGFP under its own promoter showed that CsLsi1 was localized at the distal side of the endodermis and the cortical cells in the root tips as well as in the root hairs near the root tips. Heterologous expression of CsLsi1 in a rice mutant defective in silicon uptake and the over-expression of this gene in cucumber further confirmed the role of CsLsi1 in silicon uptake. Our results suggest that CsLsi1 is a silicon influx transporter in cucumber. The cellular localization of CsLsi1 in cucumber roots is different from that in other plants, implying the possible effect of transporter localization on silicon uptake capability.
27711180	Magnaporthe oryzae Glycine-Rich Secretion Protein, Rbf1 Critically Participates in Pathogenicity through the Focal Formation of the Biotrophic Interfacial Complex.	2016	PLoS Pathog	Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus causing rice blast disease, should contend with host innate immunity to develop invasive hyphae (IH) within living host cells. However, molecular strategies to establish the biotrophic interactions are largely unknown. Here, we report the biological function of a M. oryzae-specific gene, Required-for-Focal-BIC-Formation 1 (RBF1). RBF1 expression was induced in appressoria and IH only when the fungus was inoculated to living plant tissues. Long-term successive imaging of live cell fluorescence revealed that the expression of RBF1 was upregulated each time the fungus crossed a host cell wall. Like other symplastic effector proteins of the rice blast fungus, Rbf1 accumulated in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and was translocated into the rice cytoplasm. RBF1-knockout mutants (Δrbf1) were severely deficient in their virulence to rice leaves, but were capable of proliferating in abscisic acid-treated or salicylic acid-deficient rice plants. In rice leaves, Δrbf1 inoculation caused necrosis and induced defense-related gene expression, which led to a higher level of diterpenoid phytoalexin accumulation than the wild-type fungus did. Δrbf1 showed unusual differentiation of IH and dispersal of the normally BIC-focused effectors around the short primary hypha and the first bulbous cell. In the Δrbf1-invaded cells, symplastic effectors were still translocated into rice cells but with a lower efficiency. These data indicate that RBF1 is a virulence gene essential for the focal BIC formation, which is critical for the rice blast fungus to suppress host immune responses.
27744491	QTL mapping identifies a major locus for resistance in wheat to Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps) feeding at the vegetative growth stage.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: This research provides the first report of a major locus controlling wheat resistance to Sunn pest. It developed and validated SNP markers that will be useful for marker-assisted selection. Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps Puton) is the most destructive insect pest of bread wheat and durum wheat in West and Central Asia and East Europe. Breeding for resistance at the vegetative stage of growth is vital in reducing the damage caused by overwintered adult populations that feed on shoot and leaves of seedlings, and in reducing the next generation of pest populations (nymphs and adults), which can cause damage to grain quality by feeding on spikes. In the present study, two doubled haploid (DH) populations involving resistant landraces from Afghanistan were genotyped with the 90k SNP iSelect assay and candidate gene-based KASP markers. The DH lines and parents were phenotyped for resistance to Sunn pest feeding, using artificial infestation cages at Terbol station, in Lebanon, over three years. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a single major locus on chromosome 4BS in the two populations, with the resistance allele derived from the landrace accessions, IG139431 and IG139883. The QTL explained a maximum of 42 % of the phenotypic variation in the Cham6 × IG139431 and 56 % in the Cham6 × IG139883 populations. SNP markers closest to the QTL showed high similarity to rice genes that putatively encode proteins for defense response to herbivory and wounding. The markers were validated in a large, unrelated population of parental wheat genotypes. All wheat lines carrying the 'C-G' haplotype at the identified SNPs were resistant, suggesting that selection based on a haplotype of favourable alleles would be effective in predicting resistance status of unknown genotypes.
27799937	Responses of Photosystem I Compared with Photosystem II to Fluctuating Light in the Shade-Establishing Tropical Tree Species <i>Psychotria henryi</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Shade-establishing plants growing in the forest understory are exposed to constant high light or fluctuating light when gaps are created by fallen trees. Our previous studies indicate that photosystem I (PSI) is sensitive to constant high light in shade-establishing tree species, however, the effects of fluctuating light on PSI and photosystem II (PSII) in shade-establishing species are little known. In the present study, we examined the responses of PSI and PSII to fluctuating light in comparison to constant high light in the shade-establishing species Psychotria henryi. Accompanying with significant activation of cyclic electron flow (CEF), the P700 oxidation ratio was maintained at high levels when exposed to strong light either under fluctuating light or constant high light. Under moderate fluctuating light, PSI and PSII activities were remained stable in P. henryi. Interestingly, PSI was insusceptible to fluctuating light but sensitive to constant high light in P. henryi. Furthermore, both PSI and PSII were more sensitive to constant high light than fluctuating light. These results suggest that CEF is essential for photoprotection of PSI under fluctuating light in P. henryi. Furthermore, photoinhibition of PSI under high light in P. henryi is more related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species rather than to P700 redox state, which is different from the mechanisms of PSI photoinhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Taking together, PSI is a key determiner of photosynthetic responses to fluctuating light and constant high light in the shade-establishing species P. henryi.
27843443	RNA Interference-Mediated Simultaneous Suppression of Seed Storage Proteins in Rice Grains.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Seed storage proteins (SSPs) such as glutelin, prolamin, and globulin are abundant components in some of the most widely consumed food cereals in the world. Synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), SSPs are translocated to the protein bodies. Prolamins are located at the spherical protein body I derived from the ER, whereas, glutelins and globulin are accumulated in the irregularly shaped protein bodies derived from vacuoles. Our previous studies have shown that the individual suppression of glutelins, 13-kDa prolamins and globulin caused the compensative accumulation of other SSPs. Herein, to investigate the phenotypic and molecular features of SSP deficiency transgenic rice plants suppressing all glutelins, prolamins, and globulin were generated using RNA interference (RNAi). The results revealed that glutelin A, cysteine-rich 13-kDa prolamin and globulin proteins were less accumulated but that glutelin B and ER chaperones, such as binding protein 1 (BiP1) and protein disulfide isomerase-like 1-1 (PDIL1-1), were highly accumulated at the transcript and protein levels in seeds of the transformants compared to those in the wild-type seeds. Further, the transcription of starch synthesis-related genes was reduced in immature seeds at 2 weeks after flowering, and the starch granules were loosely packaged with various sphere sizes in seed endosperms of the transformants, resulting in a floury phenotype. Interestingly, the rates of sprouting and reducing sugar accumulation during germination were found to be delayed in the transformants compared to the wild-type. In all, our results provide new insight into the role of SSPs in the formation of intracellular organelles and in germination.
27713528	Heat-induced phytohormone changes are associated with disrupted early reproductive development and reduced yield in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Heat stress causes morphological and physiological changes and reduces crop yield in rice (Oryza sativa). To investigate changes in phytohormones and their relationships with yield and other attributes under heat stress, four rice varieties (Nagina22, Huanghuazhan, Liangyoupeijiu, and Shanyou 63) were grown in pots and subjected to three high temperature treatments plus control in temperature-controlled greenhouses for 15 d during the early reproductive phase. Yield reductions in Nagina22, Huanghuazhan, and Liangyoupeijiu were attributed to reductions in spikelet fertility, spikelets per panicle, and grain weight. The adverse effects of high temperature were alleviated by application of exogenous 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) in the heat-susceptible Liangyoupeijiu. High temperature stress reduced active cytokinins, gibberellin A1 (GA1), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), but increased abscisic acid (ABA) and bound cytokinins in young panicles. Correlation analyses and application of exogenous 6-BA revealed that high temperature-induced cytokinin changes may regulate yield components by modulating the differentiation and degradation of branches and spikelets, panicle exsertion, pollen vigor, anther dehiscence, and grain size. Heat-tolerant Shanyou 63 displayed minor changes in phytohormones, panicle formation, and grain yield under high temperature compared with those of the other three varieties. These results suggest that phytohormone changes are closely associated with yield formation, and a small reduction or stability in phytohormone content is required to avoid large yield losses under heat stress.
27813561	Quantitative trait loci mapping of the stigma exertion rate and spikelet number per panicle in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2016	Genet Mol Res	The stigma exertion rate is a polygenic inherited trait that is important for increased seed yield in hybrid rice breeding. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with high stigma exertion rate, we conducted QTL mapping using 134 recombinant inbred lines derived from XieqingzaoB and Zhonghui9308, which have high and low stigma exertion rates, respectively. A total of eight QTLs (qSES6, qSSE11, qDSE1a, qDSE1b, qDSE10, qDSE11, qTSE1, and qTSE11) for single stigma exertion, double stigma exertion, and total stigma exertion were detected. The locations of qSSE11 and qTSE11 have not been previously reported, and the qDSE11 allele from parent XQZB exhibited a positive additive effect. In addition, three QTLs (qSNP1, qSNP3a, and qSNP3b), for spikelet number per panicle were identified. Of note, one QTL (qSNP1) was detected in two different environments (Hainan and Zhejiang). To evaluate the advantage of exerted stigma for cross-pollination, single, dual, and total stigma exertion should be considered separately for future genetic improvement in the production of rice hybrid seeds. In addition, this study provides information for fine mapping, gene cloning, and marker assisted selection, with emphasis on the latter.
27790231	Suppression of <i>Xo1</i>-Mediated Disease Resistance in Rice by a Truncated, Non-DNA-Binding TAL Effector of <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Delivered into plant cells by type III secretion from pathogenic Xanthomonas species, TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors are nuclear-localized, DNA-binding proteins that directly activate specific host genes. Targets include genes important for disease, genes that confer resistance, and genes inconsequential to the host-pathogen interaction. TAL effector specificity is encoded by polymorphic repeats of 33-35 amino acids that interact one-to-one with nucleotides in the recognition site. Activity depends also on N-terminal sequences important for DNA binding and C-terminal nuclear localization signals (NLS) and an acidic activation domain (AD). Coding sequences missing much of the N- and C-terminal regions due to conserved, in-frame deletions are present and annotated as pseudogenes in sequenced strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and pv. oryzae (Xoo), which cause bacterial leaf streak and bacterial blight of rice, respectively. Here we provide evidence that these sequences encode proteins we call "truncTALEs," for "truncated TAL effectors." We show that truncTALE Tal2h of Xoc strain BLS256, and by correlation truncTALEs in other strains, specifically suppress resistance mediated by the Xo1 locus recently described in the heirloom rice variety Carolina Gold. Xo1-mediated resistance is triggered by different TAL effectors from diverse X. oryzae strains, irrespective of their DNA binding specificity, and does not require the AD. This implies a direct protein-protein rather than protein-DNA interaction. Similarly, truncTALEs exhibit diverse predicted DNA recognition specificities. And, in vitro, Tal2h did not bind any of several potential recognition sites. Further, a single candidate NLS sequence in Tal2h was dispensable for resistance suppression. Many truncTALEs have one 28 aa repeat, a length not observed previously. Tested in an engineered TAL effector, this repeat required a single base pair deletion in the DNA, suggesting that it or a neighbor disengages. The presence of the 28 aa repeat, however, was not required for resistance suppression. TruncTALEs expand the paradigm for TAL effector-mediated effects on plants. We propose that Tal2h and other truncTALEs act as dominant negative ligands for an immune receptor encoded by the Xo1 locus, likely a nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat protein. Understanding truncTALE function and distribution will inform strategies for disease control.
27785615	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein γ subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence of a unique function of RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice without affecting yield. It also provides a good example for signal transduction from the external environment to inside for enhanced agricultural production that withstands the extreme climatic conditions and ensures food security. The role of heterotrimeric G-proteins functioning as signalling molecules has not been studied as extensively in plants as in animals. Recently, their importance in plant stress signalling has been emerging. In this study, the function of rice G-protein γ subunit (RGG1) in the promotion of salinity tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR64) was investigated. The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200 mM NaCl. Transcript levels of antioxidative genes, i.e., CAT, APX, and GR, and their enzyme activities increased in salinity-stressed transgenic rice plants suggesting a better antioxidant system to cope the oxidative-damages caused by salinity stress. The RGG1-induced signalling events that conferred tolerance to salinity was mediated by increased gene expression of the enzymes that scavenged reactive oxygen species. In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1. These observations suggest that most likely the stoichiometry of the G-protein complex was not disturbed under stress. Agronomic parameters, endogenous sugar content (glucose and fructose) and hormones (GA3, zeatin and IAA) were also higher in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants. A BiFC assay confirmed the interaction of RGG1 with different stress-responsive proteins which play active roles in signalling and prevention of aggregation of proteins under stress-induced perturbation. The present study will help in understanding the G-protein-mediated stress tolerance in plants.
27760223	Asymmetric Spread of SRBSDV between Rice and Corn Plants by the Vector Sogatella furcifera (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2016	PLoS One	Plant viruses are mostly transmitted by sucking insects via their piercing behaviors, which may differ due to host plant species and their developmental stages. We characterized the transmission of a fijivirus, southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), by the planthopper vector Sogatella furcifera Horváth (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), between rice and corn plants of varying developmental stages. SRBSDV was transmitted from infected rice to uninfected corn plants as efficiently as its transmission between rice plants, while was acquired by S. furcifera nymphs at a much lower rate from infected corn plants than from infected rice plants. We also recorded a high mortality of S. furcifera nymphs on corn plants. It is evident that young stages of both the virus donor and recipient plants added to the transmission efficiency of SRBSDV from rice to corn plants. Feeding behaviors of the vector recorded by electrical penetration graph showed that phloem sap ingestion, the behavioral event that is linked with plant virus acquisition, was impaired on corn plants, which accounts for the high mortality of and low virus acquisition by S. furcifera nymphs on corn plants. Our results reveal an asymmetric spread of SRBSDV between its two host plants and the underlying behavioral mechanism, which is of significance for assessing SRBSDV transmission risks and field epidemiology, and for developing integrated management approaches for SRBSDV disease.
27747443	Photo-modulation of programmed cell death in rice leaves triggered by salinity.	2017	Apoptosis	In this paper we provide evidence for involvement of chloroplast as alternate organelle for initiating PCD in plants under light and abiotic stress. In animals, mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and key executioner of programmed cell death (PCD). In plants, however, the primary site of generation of ROS is chloroplast and yet its involvement in PCD has not been worked out in details. We found by Evans blue staining that salt (150 mM NaCl)-treated protoplasts obtained from green seedlings had higher rate of cell death than protoplasts obtained from etiolated seedlings. This indicated that cell death induced by NaCl is accentuated by light. Imposition of salt-stress to green protoplasts generated H2O2. Known hallmarks of PCD i.e., blebbing of cell membrane, loabing in nucleus, nick in DNA were observed in light-exposed salt-treated protoplasts and seedlings. TUNEL-FACS assay demonstrate several DNA nicks in the salt-treated green protoplasts exposed to light. Conversely, salt-treated etiolated protoplasts kept in dark had only a few TUNEL-positive nuclei. Similarly, a substantial numbers of TUNEL positive nuclei were observed in green seedlings due to salt treatment in light. However, salt-treated etiolated seedlings kept in dark had very few TUNEL positive nuclei. Addition of Caspase 3 inhibitor (DAVD-CHO) rescued (~50 %) green protoplasts from salt-stress induced cell death suggesting an involvement of apoptosis like PCD (AL-PCD). Ultra structure studies of chloroplast, mitochondria and nucleus from the leaves obtained from salt treated seedlings at the time point that showed PCD signature, resulted to severe granal de-stacking in chloroplasts while structural integrity of mitochondria was maintained. These studies demonstrate the photo-modulation of salinity-induced PCD in photosynthetic tissues is mainly executed by chloroplasts.
27761320	Mutation of the rice XA21 predicted nuclear localization sequence does not affect resistance to <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>.	2016	PeerJ	BACKGROUND: The rice receptor kinase XA21 confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv. oryzae(Xoo). We previously reported that XA21 is cleaved in transgenic plants overexpressing XA21 with a GFP tag (Ubi-XA21-GFP) and that the released C-terminal domain is localized to the nucleus. XA21 carries a predicted nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that directs the C-terminal domain to the nucleus in transient assays, whereas alanine substitutions in the NLS disrupt the nuclear localization.

METHODS: To determine if the predicted NLS is required for XA21-mediated immunity in planta, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing an XA21 variant carrying the NLS with the same alanine substitutions (Ubi-XA21nls-GFP).

RESULTS: Ubi-XA21nls-GFP plants displayed slightly longer lesion lengths, higher Xoobacterial populations after inoculation and lower levels of reactive oxygen species production compared with the Ubi-XA21-GFP control plants. However, the Ubi-XA21nls-GFP plants express lower levels of protein than that observed in Ubi-XA21-GFP.

DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that the predicted NLS is not required for XA21-mediated immunity.
27840631	Metabolic Regulation of Carotenoid-Enriched Golden Rice Line.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is the leading cause of blindness among children and is associated with high risk of maternal mortality. In order to enhance the bioavailability of vitamin A, high carotenoid transgenic golden rice has been developed by manipulating enzymes, such as phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI). In this study, proteome and metabolite analyses were carried out to comprehend metabolic regulation and adaptation of transgenic golden rice after the manipulation of endosperm specific carotenoid pathways. The main alteration was observed in carbohydrate metabolism pathways of the transgenic seeds. The 2D based proteomic studies demonstrated that carbohydrate metabolism-related enzymes, such as pullulanase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, were primarily up-regulated in transgenic rice seeds. In addition, the enzyme PPDK was also elevated in transgenic seeds thus enhancing pyruvate biosynthesis, which is the precursor in the carotenoids biosynthetic pathway. GC-MS based metabolite profiling demonstrated an increase in the levels of glyceric acid, fructo-furanose, and galactose, while decrease in galactonic acid and gentiobiose in the transgenic rice compared to WT. It is noteworthy to mention that the carotenoid content, especially β-carotene level in transgenic rice (4.3 μg/g) was significantly enhanced. The present study highlights the metabolic adaptation process of a transgenic golden rice line (homozygous T4 progeny of SKBR-244) after enhancing carotenoid biosynthesis. The presented information would be helpful in the development of crops enriched in carotenoids by expressing metabolic flux of pyruvate biosynthesis.
27734628	Golden bananas in the field: elevated fruit pro-vitamin A from the expression of a single banana transgene.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Vitamin A deficiency remains one of the world's major public health problems despite food fortification and supplements strategies. Biofortification of staple crops with enhanced levels of pro-vitamin A (PVA) offers a sustainable alternative strategy to both food fortification and supplementation. As a proof of concept, PVA-biofortified transgenic Cavendish bananas were generated and field trialed in Australia with the aim of achieving a target level of 20 μg/g of dry weight (dw) β-carotene equivalent (β-CE) in the fruit. Expression of a Fe'i banana-derived phytoene synthase 2a (MtPsy2a) gene resulted in the generation of lines with PVA levels exceeding the target level with one line reaching 55 μg/g dw β-CE. Expression of the maize phytoene synthase 1 (ZmPsy1) gene, used to develop 'Golden Rice 2', also resulted in increased fruit PVA levels although many lines displayed undesirable phenotypes. Constitutive expression of either transgene with the maize polyubiquitin promoter increased PVA accumulation from the earliest stage of fruit development. In contrast, PVA accumulation was restricted to the late stages of fruit development when either the banana 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase or the expansin 1 promoters were used to drive the same transgenes. Wild-type plants with the longest fruit development time had also the highest fruit PVA concentrations. The results from this study suggest that early activation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and extended fruit maturation time are essential factors to achieve optimal PVA concentrations in banana fruit.
27725674	Multi-step formation, evolution, and functionalization of new cytoplasmic male sterility genes in the plant mitochondrial genomes.	2017	Cell Res	New gene origination is a major source of genomic innovations that confer phenotypic changes and biological diversity. Generation of new mitochondrial genes in plants may cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which can promote outcrossing and increase fitness. However, how mitochondrial genes originate and evolve in structure and function remains unclear. The rice Wild Abortive type of CMS is conferred by the mitochondrial gene WA352c (previously named WA352) and has been widely exploited in hybrid rice breeding. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of WA352c by the identification and analyses of 11 mitochondrial genomic recombinant structures related to WA352c in wild and cultivated rice. We deduce that these structures arose through multiple rearrangements among conserved mitochondrial sequences in the mitochondrial genome of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, coupled with substoichiometric shifting and sequence variation. We identify two expressed but nonfunctional protogenes among these structures, and show that they could evolve into functional CMS genes via sequence variations that could relieve the self-inhibitory potential of the proteins. These sequence changes would endow the proteins the ability to interact with the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11, resulting in premature programmed cell death in the anther tapetum and male sterility. Furthermore, we show that the sequences that encode the COX11-interaction domains in these WA352c-related genes have experienced purifying selection during evolution. We propose a model for the formation and evolution of new CMS genes via a "multi-recombination/protogene formation/functionalization" mechanism involving gradual variations in the structure, sequence, copy number, and function.
27733415	Genome-wide dynamics of alternative polyadenylation in rice.	2016	Genome Res	Alternative polyadenylation (APA), in which a transcript uses one of the poly(A) sites to define its 3'-end, is a common regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic gene expression. However, the potential of APA in determining crop agronomic traits remains elusive. This study systematically tallied poly(A) sites of 14 different rice tissues and developmental stages using the poly(A) tag sequencing (PAT-seq) approach. The results indicate significant involvement of APA in developmental and quantitative trait loci (QTL) gene expression. About 48% of all expressed genes use APA to generate transcriptomic and proteomic diversity. Some genes switch APA sites, allowing differentially expressed genes to use alternate 3' UTRs. Interestingly, APA in mature pollen is distinct where differential expression levels of a set of poly(A) factors and different distributions of APA sites are found, indicating a unique mRNA 3'-end formation regulation during gametophyte development. Equally interesting, statistical analyses showed that QTL tends to use APA for regulation of gene expression of many agronomic traits, suggesting a potential important role of APA in rice production. These results provide thus far the most comprehensive and high-resolution resource for advanced analysis of APA in crops and shed light on how APA is associated with trait formation in eukaryotes.
27775871	Overexpression of the 16-kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor RAG2 improves grain yield and quality of rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Increasing grain yield and improving grain quality are two important goals for rice breeding. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to the overall grain quantity and nutritional quality of rice will lay the foundation for developing new breeding strategies. RAG2 is a member of 14-to-16-kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors in rice, which belong to the albumin of seed storage proteins. We found that RAG2 was specifically expressed in ripening seed and its transcription peak was between 14 and 21 days after flowering. Grain size and 1000-grain weight were obviously increased in RAG2-overexpressed lines compared with wild type, and grain size was reduced in RAG2-suppressed lines. In addition, the major storage substances of the seeds differed significantly in RAG2-overexpressed and RAG2-suppressed lines compared to wild type. The protein content and amount of total lipids were increased and decreased, respectively, in the seeds of RAG2-overexpressed and RAG2-suppressed lines. Overexpression of RAG2 significantly increased grain size and improved grain quality and yield simultaneously. These results imply that RAG2 might play an important role in regulating grain weight and seed quality of rice. The functional characterization of rice RAG2 facilitates a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in grain size and seed quality and may be helpful in improving grain yield and quantity in cereal crops.
27965027	A functional centromere lacking CentO sequences in a newly formed ring chromosome in rice.	2016	J Genet Genomics	An awned rice (Oryza sativa) plant carrying a tiny extra chromosome was discovered among the progeny of a telotrisomic line 2n+4L. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using chromosome specific BAC clones revealed that this extra chromosome was a ring chromosome derived from part of the long arm of chromosome 4. So the aneuploidy plant was accordingly named as 2n+4L ring. We did not detect any CentO FISH signals on the ring chromosome, and found only the centromeric probe Centromeric Retrotransposon of Rice (CRR) was co-localized with the centromere-specific histone CENH3 as revealed by sequential FISH after immunodetection. The extra ring chromosome exhibited a unique segregation pattern during meiosis, including no pairing between the ring chromosome and normal chromosome 4 during prophase I and pre-separation of sister chromatids at anaphase I.
27793713	Y flowering? Regulation and activity of CONSTANS and CCT-domain proteins in Arabidopsis and crop species.	2017	Biochim Biophys Acta	Changes in day length regulate the proper timing of flowering in several plant species. The genetic architecture of this process is based on CCT-domain proteins, many of which interact with NF-Y subunits to regulate transcription of target genes. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the CONSTANS CCT-domain protein is a central photoperiodic sensor. We will discuss how the diurnal rhythms of its transcription and protein accumulation are generated, and how the protein engages into multiple complexes to control production of a systemic flowering signal. Regulatory parallels will be drawn between Arabidopsis and major crops that indicate conservation of some CCT/NF-Y modules during plant evolution. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear Factor Y in Development and Disease, edited by Prof. Roberto Mantovani.
27755575	Collinearity Analysis and High-Density Genetic Mapping of the Wheat Powdery Mildew Resistance Gene Pm40 in PI 672538.	2016	PLoS One	The wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm40, which is located on chromosomal arm 7BS, is effective against nearly all prevalent races of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) in China and is carried by the common wheat germplasm PI 672538. A set of the F1, F2 and F2:3 populations from the cross of the resistant PI 672538 with the susceptible line L1034 were used to conduct genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance and construct a high-density linkage map of the Pm40 gene. We constructed a high-density linkage genetic map with a total length of 6.18 cM and average spacing between markers of 0.48 cM.Pm40 is flanked by Xwmc335 and BF291338 at genetic distances of 0.58 cM and 0.26 cM, respectively, in deletion bin C-7BS-1-0.27. Comparative genomic analysis based on EST-STS markers established a high level of collinearity of the Pm40 genomic region with a 1.09-Mbp genomic region on Brachypodium chromosome 3, a 1.16-Mbp genomic region on rice chromosome 8, and a 1.62-Mbp genomic region on sorghum chromosome 7. We further anchored the Pm40 target intervals to the wheat genome sequence. A putative linear index of 85 wheat contigs containing 97 genes on 7BS was constructed. In total, 9 genes could be considered as candidates for the resistances to powdery mildew in the target genomic regions, which encoded proteins that were involved in the plant defense and response to pathogen attack. These results will facilitate the development of new markers for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of Pm40 in wheat breeding programs.
27752792	Molecular cloning and characterization of α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor from rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong.	2017	Biotechnol Lett	OBJECTIVES: To clone and characterize a novel bi-functional α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor (LASI) from the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong, a traditional Chinese medicine.

RESULTS: The LASI showed strong homology with members of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor family. Its putative amino acid sequence has a 40 % identity with that of the α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor from rice. LASI gene without signal peptide was expressed in E. coli Rosetta. After purification, the recombinant LASI protein was inhibitory against not only α-amylase from porcine pancreas, Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera litura and Plutella xylostella, but also subtilisin A, but not against trypsin or chymotrypsin. In addition, the expression level of LASI in rhizome was higher than that in leaf and LASI expression was enhanced by salt, chilling and drought treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first member of the Kunitz-protease inhibitor family identified in traditional Chinese medicine and it might be involved in the plant defense responses against lepidopterous pests, microorganisms and abiotic stresses.
27774087	Identification of Genes Involved in Indole-3-Acetic Acid Biosynthesis by <i>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</i> PAL5 Strain Using Transposon Mutagenesis.	2016	Front Microbiol	Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus is a beneficial nitrogen-fixing endophyte found in association with sugarcane plants and other important crops. Beneficial effects of G. diazotrophicus on sugarcane growth and productivity have been attributed to biological nitrogen fixation process and production of phytohormones especially indole-3-acetic acid (IAA); however, information about the biosynthesis and function of IAA in G. diazotrophicus is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify genes and pathways involved in IAA biosynthesis in this bacterium. In our study, the screening of two independent Tn5 mutant libraries of PAL5T strain using the Salkowski colorimetric assay revealed two mutants (Gdiaa34 and Gdiaa01), which exhibited 95% less indolic compounds than the parental strain when grown in LGIP medium supplemented with L-tryptophan. HPLC chromatograms of the wild-type strain revealed the presence of IAA and of the biosynthetic intermediates indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) and indole-3-lactate (ILA). In contrast, the HPLC profiles of both mutants showed no IAA but only a large peak of non-metabolized tryptophan and low levels of IPyA and ILA were detected. Molecular characterization revealed that Gdiaa01 and Gdiaa34 mutants had unique Tn5 insertions at different sites within the GDI2456 open read frame, which is predicted to encode a L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO). GDI2456 (lao gene) forms a cluster with GDI2455 and GDI2454 ORFs, which are predicted to encode a cytochrome C and an RidA protein, respectively. RT-qPCR showed that transcript levels of lao. cccA, and ridA genes were reduced in the Gdiaa01 as compared to PAL5T. In addition, rice plants inoculated with Gdiaa01 showed significantly smaller root development (length, surface area, number of forks and tips) than those plants inoculated with PAL5T. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that G. diazotrophicus PAL5T produces IAA via the IPyA pathway in cultures supplemented with tryptophan and provides evidence for the involvement of an L-amino acid oxidase gene cluster in the biosynthesis of IAA. Furthermore, we showed that the mutant strains with reduction in IAA biosynthesis ability, in consequence of the lower transcription levels of genes of the lao cluster, had remarkable effects on development of rice roots.
27796586	Application of rice microspore-preferred promoters to manipulate early pollen development in Arabidopsis: a heterologous system.	2016	Plant Reprod	KEY MESSAGE: Rice microspore-promoters. Based on microarray data analyzed for developing anthers and pollen grains, we identified nine rice microspore-preferred (RMP) genes, designated RMP1 through RMP9. To extend their biotechnological applicability, we then investigated the activity of RMP promoters originating from monocotyledonous rice in a heterologous system of dicotyledonous Arabidopsis. Expression of GUS was significantly induced in transgenic plants from the microspore to the mature pollen stages and was driven by the RMP1, RMP3, RMP4, RMP5, and RMP9 promoters. We found it interesting that, whereas RMP2 and RMP6 directed GUS expression in microspore at the early unicellular and bicellular stages, RMP7 and RMP8 seemed to be expressed at the late tricellular and mature pollen stages. Moreover, GUS was expressed in seven promoters, RMP3 through RMP9, during the seedling stage, in immature leaves, cotyledons, and roots. To confirm microspore-specific expression, we used complementation analysis with an Arabidopsis male-specific gametophytic mutant, sidecar pollen-2 (scp-2), to verify the activity of three promoters. That mutant shows defects in microspore development prior to pollen mitosis I. These results provide strong evidence that the SIDECAR POLLEN gene, driven by RMP promoters, successfully complements the scp-2 mutation, and they strongly suggest that these promoters can potentially be applied for manipulating the expression of target genes at the microspore stage in various species.
27706188	Edible Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Rice T1C-1 for Sprague Dawley Rats through Horizontal Gene Transfer, Allergenicity and Intestinal Microbiota.	2016	PLoS One	In this study, assessment of the safety of transgenic rice T1C-1 expressing Cry1C was carried out by: (1) studying horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Sprague Dawley rats fed transgenic rice for 90 d; (2) examining the effect of Cry1C protein in vitro on digestibility and allergenicity; and (3) studying the changes of intestinal microbiota in rats fed with transgenic rice T1C-1 in acute and subchronic toxicity tests. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing either 60% GM Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice T1C-1 expressing Cry1C protein, the parental rice Minghui 63, or a basic diet for 90 d. The GM Bt rice T1C-1 showed no evidence of HGT between rats and transgenic rice. Sequence searching of the Cry1C protein showed no homology with known allergens or toxins. Cry1C protein was rapidly degraded in vitro with simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The expressed Cry1C protein did not induce high levels of specific IgG and IgE antibodies in rats. The intestinal microbiota of rats fed T1C-1 was also analyzed in acute and subchronic toxicity tests by DGGE. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed significant individual differences in the rats' intestinal microbiota.
27704482	Molecular Breeding of Rice Restorer Lines and Hybrids for Brown Planthopper (BPH) Resistance Using the Bph14 and Bph15 Genes.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The development of hybrid rice is a practical approach for increasing rice production. However, the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål, causes severe yield loss of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and can threaten food security. Therefore, breeding hybrid rice resistant to BPH is the most effective and economical strategy to maintain high and stable production. Fortunately, numerous BPH resistance genes have been identified, and abundant linkage markers are available for molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs. Hence, we pyramided two BPH resistance genes, Bph14 and Bph15, into a susceptive CMS restorer line Huahui938 and its derived hybrids using MAS to improve the BPH resistance of hybrid rice.

RESULTS: Three near-isogenic lines (NILs) with pyramided Bph14 and Bph15 were obtained by molecular marker-assisted backcross (MAB) and phenotypic selection. The genomic components of these NILs were detected using the whole-genome SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism) array, RICE6K, suggesting that the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of the NILs was 87.88, 87.70 and 86.62 %, respectively. BPH bioassays showed that the improved NILs and their derived hybrids carrying homozygous Bph14 and Bph15 were resistant to BPH. However, the hybrids with heterozygous Bph14 and Bph15 remained susceptible to BPH. The developed NILs showed no significant differences in major agronomic traits and rice qualities compared with the recurrent parent. Moreover, the improved hybrids derived from the NILs exhibited better agronomic performance and rice quality compared with the controls under natural field conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is essential to stack Bph14 and Bph15 into both the maternal and paternal parents for developing BPH-resistant hybrid rice varieties. The SNP array with abundant DNA markers is an efficient tool for analyzing the RPG recovery of progenies and can be used to monitor the donor segments in NILs, thus being extremely important for rice molecular breeding.
27780273	Grain Filling Characteristics and Their Relations with Endogenous Hormones in Large- and Small-Grain Mutants of Rice.	2016	PLoS One	This study determined if the variation in grain filling parameters between two different spikelet types of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is regulated by the hormonal levels in the grains. Two rice mutants, namely, a large-grain mutant (AZU-M) and a small-grain mutant (ZF802-M), and their respective wild types (AZU-WT and ZF802-WT) were grown in the field. The endosperm cell division rate, filling rate, and hormonal levels: zeatin + zeatin riboside (Z+ZR), indo-3-acetic acid (IAA), polyamines (PAs), and abscisic acid (ABA) were determined. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the filling and endosperm cell division rates. These rates were synchronous between the superior and inferior spikelets for both mutants. However, the abovementioned parameters were significantly different between the two spikelet types for the two wild types. The superior spikelets filled faster and their filling rate was higher compared to the inferior ones. Changes in the concentrations of plant hormones were consistent with the observed endosperm cell division rate and the filling rate for both types of spikelets of mutant and wild type plants. Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between cell division and filling rates with the concentrations of the investigated hormones. Exogenous chemical application verified the role of ABA, IAA, and PAs in grain filling. The results indicate that poor filling of inferior spikelets in rice occurs primarily due to the reduced hormone concentrations therein, leading to lower division rate of endosperm cells, fewer endosperm cells, slower filling rate, and smaller grain weight.
27745656	Assessing the bioremediation potential of arsenic tolerant bacterial strains in rice rhizosphere interface.	2016	J Environ Sci (China)	The arsenic tolerant bacterial strains Staphylococcus arlettae (NBRIEAG-6), Staphylococcus sp. (NBRIEAG-8) and Brevibacillus sp. (NBRIEAG-9) were tested for their roles in enhancing plant growth and induction of stress-related enzymes in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. NDR-359) plants at two different concentrations, 30 and 15mg/kg of As(V) and As(III), respectively. An experiment was conducted to test the effect of these strains on plant growth promotion and arsenic uptake. We found 30%-40% reduction in total As uptake in bacteria-inoculated plants, with increased plant growth parameters compared to non-inoculated plants. Moreover, the bacteria-inoculated plants showed reduced activity of total glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR) compared to their respective controls, which suggests the bacteria-mediated reduction of oxidative stress in plants. Thus, these strains were found to be beneficial in terms of the biochemical and physiological status of the plants under arsenic stress conditions. Furthermore, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA) on enzymatic and non-enzymatic assays also revealed clear variations. The results support the distinction between control and treatments in both shoots and roots. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of rhizobacteria in alleviating arsenic stress in rice plants.
27764161	Polycomb Protein OsFIE2 Affects Plant Height and Grain Yield in Rice.	2016	PLoS One	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have been shown to affect growth and development in plants. To further elucidate their role in these processes in rice, we isolated and characterized a rice mutant which exhibits dwarfism, reduced seed setting rate, defective floral organ, and small grains. Map-based cloning revealed that abnormal phenotypes were attributed to a mutation of the Fertilization Independent Endosperm 2 (OsFIE2) protein, which belongs to the PcG protein family. So we named the mutant as osfie2-1. Histological analysis revealed that the number of longitudinal cells in the internodes decreased in osfie2-1, and that lateral cell layer of the internodes was markedly thinner than wild-type. In addition, compared to wild-type, the number of large and small vascular bundles decreased in osfie2-1, as well as cell number and cell size in spikelet hulls. OsFIE2 is expressed in most tissues and the coded protein localizes in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that OsFIE2 interacts with OsiEZ1 which encodes an enhancer of zeste protein previously identified as a histone methylation enzyme. RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that some homeotic genes and genes involved in endosperm starch synthesis, cell division/expansion and hormone synthesis and signaling are differentially expressed between osfie2-1 and wild-type. In addition, the contents of IAA, GA3, ABA, JA and SA in osfie2-1 are significantly different from those in wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate that OsFIE2 plays an important role in the regulation of plant height and grain yield in rice.
27287092	An investigation of effects of modification processes on physical properties and mechanism of drug release for sustaining drug release from modified rice.	2016	Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of modification processes on physical properties and explain the mechanism of sustained drug release from modified rice (MR). Various types of Vietnamese rice were introduced in the study as the matrices of sustained release dosage form. Rice was thermally modified in water for a determined temperature at different times with a simple process. Then tablets containing MR and isradipine, the model drug, were prepared to investigate the capability of sustained drug release. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine different morphologies between MR formulations. Flow property of MR was analyzed by Hausner ratio and Carr's indices. The dissolution rate and swelling/erosion behaviors of tablets were evaluated at pH 1.2 and pH6.8 at 37±0.5°C. The matrix tablet containing MR showed a sustained release as compared to the control. The SEM analyses and swelling/erosion studies indicated that the morphology as well as swelling/erosion rate of MR were modulated by modification time, drying method and incubation. It was found that the modification process was crucial because it could highly affect the granule morphologies and hence, leading to the change of flowability and swelling/erosion capacity for sustained release of drug.
27812419	Genome-wide identification and characterization of TIFY family genes in Moso Bamboo (<i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>) and expression profiling analysis under dehydration and cold stresses.	2016	PeerJ	The proteins containing the TIFY domain belong to a plant-specific family of putative transcription factors and could be divided into four subfamilies: ZML, TIFY, PPD and JAZ. They not only function as key regulators of jasmonate hormonal response, but are also involved in responding to abiotic stress. In this study, we identified 24 TIFY genes (PeTIFYs) in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) of Poaceae by analyzing the whole genome sequence. One PeTIFY belongs to TIFY subfamily, 18 and five belong to JAZ and ZML subfamilies, respectively. Two equivocal gene models were re-predicted and a putative retrotransposition event was found in a ZML protein. The distribution and conservation of domain or motif, and gene structure were also analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis with TIFY proteins of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa indicated that JAZ subfamily could be further divided to four groups. Evolutionary analysis revealed intragenomic duplication and orthologous relationship between P. edulis, O. sativa, and B. distachyon. Calculation of the non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates and their ratios indicated that the duplication of PeTIFY may have occurred around 16.7 million years ago (MYA), the divergence time of TIFY family among the P. edulis-O. sativa, P. edulis-B. distachyon, and O. sativa-B. distachyon was approximately 39 MYA, 39 MYA, and 45 MYA, respectively. They appear to have undergone extensive purifying selection during evolution. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that more than 50% of PeTIFY genes could be up-regulated by cold and dehydration stresses, and some PeTIFYs also share homology to know TIFYs involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Our results made insights into TIFY family of Moso bamboo, an economically important non-timber forest resource, and provided candidates for further identification of genes involved in regulating responses to abiotic stress.
27872859	Mapping QTLs for Fertility Restoration of Different Cytoplasmic Male Sterility Types in Rice Using Two <i>Oryza sativa ×O. rufipogon</i> Backcross Inbred Line Populations.	2016	Biomed Res Int	Hybrid rice breeding using cytoplasmic male sterility/fertility restoration (CMS/Rf) systems plays an important role in ensuring global food security. Two backcross inbred line (BIL) populations derived from either Xieqingzao B (XB)//XB/Dongxiang wild rice (DWR) (XXD) or XB//DWR/XB (XDX) were used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fertility restoration of Dwarf wild abortive- (DA-), Indonesia Paddy- (ID-), and DWR-type CMS in rice. Lines with ID- and DA-type CMS were testcrossed with both the XXD- and XDX-BILs, while the line with DWR-type CMS was testcrossed with the XDX-BILs only. A total of 16 QTLs for fertility restoration of CMS systems were identified, including three for DWR-type CMS, six for DA-type CMS, and seven for ID-type CMS. All of the additive alleles in the QTLs were derived from Oryza rufipogon. Eleven QTLs were clustered in five chromosomal regions, indicating that common Rf loci restored different CMS systems, and the favorable O. rufipogon alleles could be used to develop restorer lines for various CMS types by marker-assisted selection.
27738714	Transcription factors involved in drought tolerance and their possible role in developing drought tolerant cultivars with emphasis on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: TFs involved in drought tolerance in plants may be utilized in future for developing drought tolerant cultivars of wheat and some other crops. Plants have developed a fairly complex stress response system to deal with drought and other abiotic stresses. These response systems often make use of transcription factors (TFs); a gene encoding a specific TF together with -its target genes constitute a regulon, and take part in signal transduction to activate/silence genes involved in response to drought. Since, five specific families of TFs (out of >80 known families of TFs) have gained widespread attention on account of their significant role in drought tolerance in plants, TFs and regulons belonging to these five multi-gene families (AP2/EREBP, bZIP, MYB/MYC, NAC and WRKY) have been described and their role in improving drought tolerance discussed in this brief review. These TFs often undergo reversible phosphorylation to perform their function, and are also involved in complex networks. Therefore, some details about reversible phosphorylation of TFs by different protein kinases/phosphatases and the co-regulatory networks, which involve either only TFs or TFs with miRNAs, have also been discussed. Literature on transgenics involving genes encoding TFs and that on QTLs and markers associated with TF genes involved in drought tolerance has also been reviewed. Throughout the review, there is a major emphasis on wheat as an important crop, although examples from the model cereal rice (sometimes maize also), and the model plant Arabidopsis have also been used. This knowledge base may eventually allow the use of TF genes for development of drought tolerant cultivars, particularly in wheat.
27826313	Search for Nodulation and Nodule Development-Related Cystatin Genes in the Genome of Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>).	2016	Front Plant Sci	Nodulation, nodule development and senescence directly affects nitrogen fixation efficiency, and previous studies have shown that inhibition of some cysteine proteases delay nodule senescence, so their nature inhibitors, cystatin genes, are very important in nodulation, nodule development, and senescence. Although several cystatins are actively transcribed in soybean nodules, their exact roles and functional diversities in legume have not been well explored in genome-wide survey studies. In this report, we performed a genome-wide survey of cystatin family genes to explore their relationship to nodulation and nodule development in soybean and identified 20 cystatin genes that encode peptides with 97-245 amino acid residues, different isoelectric points (pI) and structure characteristics, and various putative plant regulatory elements in 3000 bp putative promoter fragments upstream of the 20 soybean cystatins in response to different abiotic/biotic stresses, hormone signals, and symbiosis signals. The expression profiles of these cystatin genes in soybean symbiosis with rhizobium strain Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain 113-2 revealed that 7 cystatin family genes play different roles in nodulation as well as nodule development and senescence. However, these genes were not root nodule symbiosis (RNS)-specific and did not encode special clade cystatin protein with structures related to nodulation and nodule development. Besides, only two of these soybean cystatins were not upregulated in symbiosis after ABA treatment. The functional analysis showed that a candidate gene Glyma.15G227500 (GmCYS16) was likely to play a positive role in soybean nodulation. Besides, evolutionary relationships analysis divided the cystatin genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, rice, barley and four legume plants into three groups. Interestingly, Group A cystatins are special in legume plants, but only include one of the above-mentioned 7 cystatin genes related to nodulation and nodule development. Overall, our results provide useful information or clues for our understanding of the functional diversity of legume cystatin family proteins in soybean nodulation and nodule development and for finding nodule-specific cysteine proteases in soybean.
27716126	Unraveling the molecular basis of oxidative stress management in a drought tolerant rice genotype Nagina 22.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Drought stress tolerance for crop improvement is an important goal worldwide. Drought is a complex trait, and it is vital to understand the complex physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance to ﻿tackle﻿ it effectively. Osmotic adjustment, oxidative stress management (OSM), and cell membrane stability (CMS) are major components of cellular tolerance under drought stress. In the current study, we explored the molecular basis of OSM in the drought tolerant rice variety, Nagina 22 and compared it with the popular drought sensitive rice variety, IR 64, under drought imposed at the reproductive stage, to understand how the parental polymorphisms correlate with the superiority of Nagina 22 and tolerant bulk populations under drought.

RESULTS: We generated recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from contrasting parents Nagina 22 and IR 64 and focussed on spikelet fertility (SF), in terms of its correlation with OSM, which is an important component of drought tolerance in Nagina 22. Based on SF under drought stress and its correlations with other yield related traits, we used superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity assays to establish the relationship between SF and OSM genes in the tolerant and sensitive lines. Among the OSM enzymes studied, GR had a significant and positive correlation with single plant yield (SPY) under drought stress. GR was also positively correlated with APX but negatively so with SOD. Interestingly, none of the enzyme-morphology correlations were significant under irrigated control (IC). Through genome-wide SNP analysis of the 21 genes encoding for OSM enzymes, we identified the functional polymorphisms between the parents and identified superior alleles. By using network analysis of OSM genes in rice, we identified the genes that are central to the OSM network.

CONCLUSIONS: From the biochemical and morphological data and the SNP analysis, the superiority of Nagina 22 in spikelet fertility under drought stress is because of its superior alleles for SOD (SOD2, SODCC1, SODA) and GR (GRCP2) rather than for APX, for which IR 64 had the superior allele (APX8). Nagina 22 can bypass APX8 by directly interacting with SODA. For nine of the 11 genes present in the central network, Nagina 22 had the superior alleles. We propose that Nagina 22 tolerance could mainly be because of SODA which is a reactive oxygen scavenger in mitochondria which is directly associated with spikelet fertility.
27729476	Analysis of high iron rice lines reveals new miRNAs that target iron transporters in roots.	2016	J Exp Bot	The present study highlights the molecular regulation of iron transport in soyFER1-overexpressing transgenic rice. Accumulation of iron in three different seed developmental stages, milk, dough, and mature, has been examined. The transgenic seeds of the milk stage showed significant augmentation of iron and zinc levels compared with wild-type seeds, and similar results were observed throughout the dough and mature stages. To investigate the regulation of iron transport, the role of miRNAs was studied in roots of transgenic rice. Sequencing of small RNA libraries revealed 153 known and 41 novel miRNAs in roots. Among them, 59 known and 14 novel miRNAs were found to be significantly expressed. miR166, miR399, and miR408 were identified as playing a vital role in iron uptake in roots of transgenic plants . Most importantly, four putative novel miRNAs, namely miR11, miR26, miR30, and miR31, were found to be down-regulated in roots of transgenic plants. For all these four novel miRNAs, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 4 (NRAMP4), encoding a metal transporter, was predicted as a target gene. It is hypothesized that the NRAMP4 transporter is activated in roots of transgenic plants due to the lower abundance of its corresponding putative novel miRNAs. The relative transcript level of the NRAMP4 transcript was increased from 0.107 in the wild type to 65.24 and 55.39 in transgenic plants, which demonstrates the elevated amount of iron transport in transgenic plants. In addition, up-regulation of OsYSL15, OsFRO2, and OsIRT1 in roots also facilitates iron loading in transgenic seeds.
27764111	The QTL GNP1 Encodes GA20ox1, Which Increases Grain Number and Yield by Increasing Cytokinin Activity in Rice Panicle Meristems.	2016	PLoS Genet	Cytokinins and gibberellins (GAs) play antagonistic roles in regulating reproductive meristem activity. Cytokinins have positive effects on meristem activity and maintenance. During inflorescence meristem development, cytokinin biosynthesis is activated via a KNOX-mediated pathway. Increased cytokinin activity leads to higher grain number, whereas GAs negatively affect meristem activity. The GA biosynthesis genes GA20oxs are negatively regulated by KNOX proteins. KNOX proteins function as modulators, balancing cytokinin and GA activity in the meristem. However, little is known about the crosstalk among cytokinin and GA regulators together with KNOX proteins and how KNOX-mediated dynamic balancing of hormonal activity functions. Through map-based cloning of QTLs, we cloned a GA biosynthesis gene, Grain Number per Panicle1 (GNP1), which encodes rice GA20ox1. The grain number and yield of NIL-GNP1TQ were significantly higher than those of isogenic control (Lemont). Sequence variations in its promoter region increased the levels of GNP1 transcripts, which were enriched in the apical regions of inflorescence meristems in NIL-GNP1TQ. We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher GNP1 transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA2oxs and reduced GA1 and GA3 accumulation. This rebalancing process increased cytokinin activity, thereby increasing grain number and grain yield in rice. These findings uncover important, novel roles of GAs in rice florescence meristem development and provide new insights into the crosstalk between cytokinin and GA underlying development process.
27723774	Combining Limited Multiple Environment Trials Data with Crop Modeling to Identify Widely Adaptable Rice Varieties.	2016	PLoS One	Multi-Environment Trials (MET) are conventionally used to evaluate varietal performance prior to national yield trials, but the accuracy of MET is constrained by the number of test environments. A modeling approach was innovated to evaluate varietal performance in a large number of environments using the rice model ORYZA (v3). Modeled yields representing genotype by environment interactions were used to classify the target population of environments (TPE) and analyze varietal yield and yield stability. Eight Green Super Rice (GSR) and three check varieties were evaluated across 3796 environments and 14 seasons in Southern Asia. Based on drought stress imposed on rainfed rice, environments were classified into nine TPEs. Relative to the check varieties, all GSR varieties performed well except GSR-IR1-5-S14-S2-Y2, with GSR-IR1-1-Y4-Y1, and GSR-IR1-8-S6-S3-Y2 consistently performing better in all TPEs. Varietal evaluation using ORYZA (v3) significantly corresponded to the evaluation based on actual MET data within specific sites, but not with considerably larger environments. ORYZA-based evaluation demonstrated the advantage of GSR varieties in diverse environments. This study substantiated that the modeling approach could be an effective, reliable, and advanced approach to complement MET in the assessment of varietal performance on spatial and temporal scales whenever quality soil and weather information are accessible. With available local weather and soil information, this approach can also be adopted to other rice producing domains or other crops using appropriate crop models.
27725719	Effect of methyl salicylate (MeSA), an elicitor on growth, physiology and pathology of resistant and susceptible rice varieties.	2016	Sci Rep	Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a volatile organic compound synthesized from salicylic acid (SA) a plant hormone that helps to fight against plant disease. Seed treatment with MeSA, is an encouraging method to the seed industry to produce more growth and yield. The aim of our study is to find out the growth, development and disease tolerance of rice seed treated with different concentrations of MeSA. Also the seed treatments were studied to determine whether they directly influenced seedling emergence and growth in rice (Oryza sativa L) cultivars 'IR 20, IR 50, IR 64, ASD 16, ASD 19 and ADT 46' under greenhouse condition. MeSA seed treatments at 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/L significantly increased seedling emergence. Effects were stronger in IR 50, and IR 64 and the effects were dose dependent, although the relationship between dose and effect was not always linear. MeSA seed treated rice plant against bacterial blight were analyzed. Bacterial blight was more effectively controlled by the seed treated with 100 mg/L than others. These results suggest that seed treatment with MeSA alters plant physiology in ways that may be useful for crop production as well as protection.
27816829	Small family, big impact: In silico analysis of DREB2 transcription factor family in rice.	2016	Comput Biol Chem	Dehydration-responsive element- (DREB) proteins are considered as the master regulators of plant abiotic stress responses including drought, salinity and cold. They are also involved in other developmental processes such as embryo and endosperm development. DREB family of transcription factors consist of two sub families namely CBF1/DREB1 and DREB2. In this study, a genome-wide in silico analysis was carried out to dissect the structure and function of DREB2 family transcription factors in the rice genome. Using Arabidopsis DREB2 sequences a total of five rice DREB2 homologs were identified and they were distributed among four chromosomes. All OsDREBs contained the AP2 domain and unique [K/R]GKKGPxN motif characteristic to DREB2 family. During rice growth and development, three OsDREB2s namely OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B and OsABI4 were expressed and their expression was confined to embryo and endosperm tissues. OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B and OsDREB2C were expressed under abiotic stress conditions. OsDREB2B was expressed under drought, salinity and cold stress conditions while OsDREB2A and OsDREB2C were expressed only under drought and salinity conditions. The putative promoter regions of OsDREB2s were enriched with elements related to cellular development, hormonal regulation and stress response validating the observed expression dynamics. Co-expression analysis revealed that embryo development and stress related genes were expressed together with OsDREB2s. Predicted post-translational modifications indicated the fine regulation of OsDREB2s. These findings may shed light in uncovering the complex abiotic stress signaling networks and future genomics studies targeting the development of climate ready crops.
27578842	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	2016	J Exp Bot	YABBY genes encode seed plant-specific transcription factors that play pivotal roles in diverse aspects of leaf, shoot, and flower development. Members of the YABBY gene family are primarily expressed in lateral organs in a polar manner and function to specify abaxial cell fate in dicotyledons, but this polar expression is not conserved in monocotyledons. The function of YABBY genes is therefore not well understood in monocotyledons. Here we show that overexpression of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) YABBY4 gene (OsYABBY4) leads to a semi-dwarf phenotype, abnormal development in the uppermost internode, an increased number of floral organs, and insensitivity to gibberellin (GA) treatment. We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice). OsYABBY4 also suppresses the expression level of SLR1 and interacts with SLR1 protein. The interaction inhibits GA-dependent degradation of SLR1 and therefore leads to GA insensitivity. These data together suggest that OsYABBY4 serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development.
27634462	The NtrY-NtrX two-component system is involved in controlling nitrate assimilation in Herbaspirillum seropedicae strain SmR1.	2016	FEBS J	Herbaspirillum seropedicae is a diazotrophic β-Proteobacterium found endophytically associated with gramineae (Poaceae or graminaceous plants) such as rice, sorghum and sugar cane. In this work we show that nitrate-dependent growth in this organism is regulated by the master nitrogen regulatory two-component system NtrB-NtrC, and by NtrY-NtrX, which functions to specifically regulate nitrate metabolism. NtrY is a histidine kinase sensor protein predicted to be associated with the membrane and NtrX is the response regulator partner. The ntrYntrX genes are widely distributed in Proteobacteria. In α-Proteobacteria they are frequently located downstream from ntrBC, whereas in β-Proteobacteria these genes are located downstream from genes encoding an RNA methyltransferase and a proline-rich protein with unknown function. The NtrX protein of α-Proteobacteria has an AAA+ domain, absent in those from β-Proteobacteria. An ntrY mutant of H. seropedicae showed the wild-type nitrogen fixation phenotype, but the nitrate-dependent growth was abolished. Gene fusion assays indicated that NtrY is involved in the expression of genes coding for the assimilatory nitrate reductase as well as the nitrate-responsive two-component system NarX-NarL (narK and narX promoters, respectively). The purified NtrX protein was capable of binding the narK and narX promoters, and the binding site at the narX promoter for the NtrX protein was determined by DNA footprinting. In silico analyses revealed similar sequences in other promoter regions of H. seropedicae that are related to nitrate assimilation, supporting the role of the NtrY-NtrX system in regulating nitrate metabolism in H. seropedicae.
27714836	Ingestion of Bt rice pollen does not reduce the survival or hypopharyngeal gland development of Apis mellifera adults.	2017	Environ Toxicol Chem	Because of its ecological and economic importance, the honey bee Apis mellifera is commonly used to assess the environmental risk of insect-resistant, genetically modified plants. In the present study, feeding-exposure experiments were used to determine whether pollen from transgenic rice harms A. mellifera worker bees. In 1 experiment, the survival and mean acinus diameter of hypopharyngeal glands of adult bees were similar when bees were fed on pollen from Bt rice lines or from a non-Bt rice line, but bee survival was significantly reduced when they received pollen that was mixed with potassium arsenate as a positive control. In a second experiment, bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were not reduced when adult bees were fed on non-Bt pollen and a sucrose solution supplemented with Cry2A at 400 µg/g, Cry1C at 50 µg/g, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 400 µg/g, but bee survival and hypopharyngeal gland development were reduced when the diet was supplemented with soybean trypsin inhibitor as a positive control. In both experiments, the uptake of Cry proteins by adult bees was confirmed. Overall, the results indicate that the planting of Bt rice lines expressing Cry2A or Cry1C protein poses a negligible risk to A. mellifera worker bees.

27984138	Physico-chemical, structural, pasting and thermal properties of starches of fourteen Himalayan rice cultivars.	2017	Int J Biol Macromol	Starch of fourteen rice cultivars grown in Himalayan region were evaluated for physico-chemical, structural, pasting and thermal properties. The rice cultivars selected showed a wide variation in apparent amylose content (AAC), ranging between 10.76%-26.87%, highest in CH-1039 and lowest in SKAU-292 starch. There were ten low, three intermediate and one high AAC rice. Resistant starch content varied significantly among the rice cultivars, ranging from 6.00% to 19.60%. Generally, high ACC starches presented high contents of resistant starch. Water absorption capacity (80.10-130.32%), swelling (5.73-9.61g/g) and solubility (0.037-0.090g/g) indices varied significantly among the rice cultivars. The rice starch granule morphology showed polyhedral or irregular shapes and granular sizes in the range of 1.8-6.7μm in different rice starches. Pasting profile of starch varied significantly among the rice cultivars, probably due to variations in their AAC. Thermal properties of the starches ranged considerably among different rice cultivars: onset temperature of gelatinization, To (58.25-72.49°C), peak temperature of gelatinization, Tp (69.93-93.26°C), conclusion temperature of gelatinization, Tc (97.28±8.28-112.16°C) and gelatinization enthalpy ΔHG (14.29-29.63J/g). The ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of rice starches identified most of the α-1→4 glucosidic linkages within the absorption bands of 1149-1023cm-1.
27771250	Characterization and evolutionary analysis of ent-kaurene synthase like genes from the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) possesses various labdane-related diterpene synthase genes, homologs of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS) that are responsible for the biosynthesis of phytohormone gibberellins. The CPS homologs and KS like (KSL) homologs successively converted geranylgeranyl diphosphate to cyclic diterpene hydrocarbons via ent-copalyl diphosphate or syn-copalyl diphosphate in O. sativa. Consequently, a variety of labdane-related diterpenoids, including phytoalexin phytocassanes, momilactones and oryzalexins, have been identified from cultivated rice. Our previous report indicated that the biosynthesis of phytocassanes and momilactones is conserved in Oryza rufipogon, the progenitor of Asian cultivated rice. Moreover, their biosynthetic gene clusters, containing OsCPS2 and OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis and OsCPS4 and OsKSL4 for momilactone biosynthesis, are also present in the O. rufipogon genome. We herein characterized O. rufipogon homologs of OsKSL5, OsKSL6, OsKSL8 responsible for oryzalexin S biosynthesis, and OsKSL10 responsible for oryzalexins A-F biosynthesis, to obtain more evolutionary insight into diterpenoid biosynthesis in O. sativa. Our phytoalexin analyses showed that no accumulation of oryzalexins was detected in extracts from O. rufipogon leaf blades. In vitro functional analyses indicated that unlike OsKSL10, O. rufipogon KSL10 functions as an ent-miltiradiene synthase, which explains the lack of accumulation of oryzalexins A-F in O. rufipogon. The different functions of KSL5 and KSL8 in O. sativa japonica to those in indica are conserved in each type of O. rufipogon, while KSL6 functions (ent-isokaurene synthases) are well conserved. Our study suggests that O. sativa japonica has evolved distinct specialized diterpenoid metabolism, including the biosynthesis of oryzalexins.
27924127	SSR based genetic diversity of pigmented and aromatic rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) genotypes of the western Himalayan region of India.	2016	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	A set of 24 of SSR markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity in 16 rice genotypes found in Western Himalayas of Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, India. The level of polymorphism among the genotypes of rice was evaluated from the number of alleles and PIC value for each of the 24 SSR loci. A total of 68 alleles were detected across the 16 genotypes through the use of these 24 SSR markers The number of alleles per locus generated varied from 2 (RM 338, RM 452, RM 171) to 6 (RM 585, RM 249, RM 481, RM 162). The PIC values varied from 0.36 (RM 1) to 0.86 (RM 249) with an average of 0.62 per locus. Based on information generated, the genotypes got separated in six different clusters. Cluster 1 comprised of 4 genotypes viz; Zag 1, Zag 13, Pusa sugandh 3, and Zag 14, separated from each other at a similarity value of 0.40. Cluster second comprised of 3 landraces viz; Zag 2. Zag 4 and Zag10 separated from each other at a similarity value of 0.45. Cluster third comprised of 3 genotypes viz; Grey rice, Mushk budji and Kamad separated from each other at a similarity value of 0.46. Cluster fourth had 2 landraces viz; Kawa kreed and Loual anzul, and was not sub clustered. Fifth cluster had 3 genotypes viz; Zag 12, Purple rice and Jhelum separated from each other at a similarity value of 0.28. Cluster 6 comprised of a single popular variety i.e. Shalimar rice 1 with independent lineage.
27696287	Molecular Dissection of Seedling Salinity Tolerance in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Using a High-Density GBS-Based SNP Linkage Map.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Salinity is one of the many abiotic stresses limiting rice production worldwide. Several studies were conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for traits associated to salinity tolerance. However, due to large confidence interval for the position of QTLs, utility of reported QTLs and the associated markers has been limited in rice breeding programs. The main objective of this study is to construct a high-density rice genetic map for identification QTLs and candidate genes for salinity tolerance at seedling stage.

RESULTS: We evaluated a population of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between Bengal and Pokkali for nine traits related to salinity tolerance. A total of 9303 SNP markers generated by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) were mapped to 2817 recombination points. The genetic map had a total map length of 1650 cM with an average resolution of 0.59 cM between markers. For nine traits, a total of 85 additive QTLs were identified, of which, 16 were large-effect QTLs and the rest were small-effect QTLs. The average interval size of QTL was about 132 kilo base pairs (Kb). Eleven of the 85 additive QTLs validated 14 reported QTLs for shoot potassium concentration, sodium-potassium ratio, salt injury score, plant height, and shoot dry weight. Epistatic QTL mapping identified several pairs of QTLs that significantly contributed to the variation of traits. The QTL for high shoot K+ concentration was mapped near the qSKC1 region. However, candidate genes within the QTL interval were a CC-NBS-LRR protein, three uncharacterized genes, and transposable elements. Additionally, many QTLs flanked small chromosomal intervals containing few candidate genes. Annotation of the genes located within QTL intervals indicated that ion transporters, osmotic regulators, transcription factors, and protein kinases may play essential role in various salt tolerance mechanisms.

CONCLUSION: The saturation of SNP markers in our linkage map increased the resolution of QTL mapping. Our study offers new insights on salinity tolerance and presents useful candidate genes that will help in marker-assisted gene pyramiding to develop salt tolerant rice varieties.
27733118	Genome-wide analysis of autophagy-associated genes in foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) and characterization of the function of SiATG8a in conferring tolerance to nitrogen starvation in rice.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Autophagy is a cellular degradation process that is highly evolutionarily-conserved in yeast, plants, and animals. In plants, autophagy plays important roles in regulating intracellular degradation and recycling of amino acids in response to nutrient starvation, senescence, and other environmental stresses. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) has strong resistance to stresses and has been proposed as an ideal material for use in the study of the physiological mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Although the genome sequence of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is available, the characteristics and functions of abiotic stress-related genes remain largely unknown for this species.

RESULTS: A total of 37 putative ATG (autophagy-associated genes) genes in the foxtail millet genome were identified. Gene duplication analysis revealed that both segmental and tandem duplication events have played significant roles in the expansion of the ATG gene family in foxtail millet. Comparative synteny mapping between the genomes of foxtail millet and rice suggested that the ATG genes in both species have common ancestors, as their ATG genes were primarily located in similar syntenic regions. Gene expression analysis revealed the induced expression of 31 SiATG genes by one or more phytohormone treatments, 26 SiATG genes by drought, salt and cold, 24 SiATG genes by darkness and 25 SiATG genes by nitrogen starvation. Results of qRT-PCR showing that among 37 SiATG genes, the expression level of SiATG8a was the highest after nitrogen starvation treatment 24 h, suggesting its potential role in tolerance to nutrient starvation. Moreover, the heterologous expression of SiATG8a in rice improved nitrogen starvation tolerance. Compared to wild type rice, the transgenic rice performed better and had higher aboveground total nitrogen content when the plants were grown under nitrogen starvation conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results deepen understanding about the characteristics and functions of ATG genes in foxtail millet and also identify promising new genetic resources that should be of use in future efforts to develop varieties of foxtail millet and other crop species that have resistance to nitrogen deficiency stress.
27756006	Senescence-specific change in ROS scavenging enzyme activities and regulation of various SOD isozymes to ROS levels in psf mutant rice leaves.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	To clarify the interaction between different antioxidant enzymes for monitoring oxidative stress and ROS burst in rice senescent leaves, we investigated the genotype-dependent alteration in temporal patterns of the O2•- production rate, H2O2 content, and ROS-scavenging enzyme activities during leaf senescence in two rice genotypes, namely, the premature senescence of flag leaf (psf) mutant and its wild type. Results showed that the psf mutant differed obviously from its wild type in leaf O2•- generation rate and H2O2 content accumulation, and the decreased activities of SOD, CAT, and APX in the psf leaves were strongly responsible for the increased ROS level and the accelerated leaf senescence. By contrast, the increase in POD activity was positively correlated with the senescence-related enhancement in O2•- generation in rice leaves. Among various SOD isoforms, Mn-SOD responded sensitively to the increasing O2•- generation rate, whereas Cu/Zn-SOD remained stable with the progression of leaf senescence. These findings suggest that the senescence-related decline in total SOD activity was mostly attributable to the downregulation of both the translation and transcription of Mn-SOD isoform. This occurrence finally resulted in the collapse of SOD defense system and accelerated leaf senescence for the psf mutant. Furthermore, we presented the possible contribution of several Cu/Zn-SOD expression patterns to the senescence-related O2•- detoxification in different cell compartments.
27813582	Genome-wide expression analysis of a rice mutant line under salt stress.	2016	Genet Mol Res	Salinity is a major environmental stress to plants. In this study, the ability of plants to tolerate salt was investigated by studying growth, physiological characteristics, and expression levels of genes related to the salt-stress response in the salt-tolerant rice mutant (Till-II-877), which was derived from γ-ray irradiation. Compared to plants grown under normal conditions, the height and root length of wild type (WT) were reduced by approximately 40 and 29% following exposure to salt stress for 3 weeks, whereas Till-II-877 line showed 29 and 23% reductions in plant height and root length, respectively. No significant changes were observed in total chlorophyll content, and the malondialdehyde content of the mutant increased less than that of the WT under salt treatment. Gene expression was compared between the WT and mutant lines using microarray analysis. An unbiased analysis of the gene expression datasets allowed us to identify the pathways involved in salt-stress responses. Among the most significantly affected pathways, changes in gene expression were observed in α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (in lipid metabolism), fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis (in carbohydrate metabolism), cysteine and methionine metabolism (in amino acid metabolism), and carbon fixation (in the energy metabolism of photosynthetic organisms) under salt stress. These results show that the differential response of plants subjected to salt stress was due to changes in multiple metabolic pathways. These findings increase our understanding of the effects of salt stress in rice and may aid in the development of salt-tolerant rice cultivars.
27775031	Evolutionary plasticity of restorer-of-fertility-like proteins in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Hybrid seed production in rice relies on cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) induced by specific mitochondrial proteins, whose deleterious effects are suppressed by nuclear Restorer of Fertility (RF) genes. The majority of RF proteins belong to a specific clade of the RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat protein family. We have characterised 'restorer-of-fertility-like' (RFL) sequences from 13 Oryza genomes and the Brachypodium distachyon genome. The majority of the RFL sequences are found in genomic clusters located at two or three chromosomal loci with only a minor proportion being present as isolated genes. The RFL genomic cluster located on Oryza chromosome 10, the location of almost all known active rice RF genes, shows extreme variation in structure and gene content between species. We show evidence for homologous recombination events as an efficient mechanism for generating the huge repertoire of RNA sequence recognition motifs within RFL proteins and a major driver of RFL sequence evolution. The RFL sequences identified here will improve our understanding of the molecular basis of CMS and fertility restoration in plants and will accelerate the development of new breeding strategies.
27757115	Association Mapping for Aluminum Tolerance in a Core Collection of Rice Landraces.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Trivalent aluminum (Al3+) has drastic effect on the rice production in acidic soils. Elite genes for aluminum (Al) tolerance might exist in rice landraces. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to mine the elite genes within rice landraces. Association mapping for Al tolerance traits [i.e., relative root elongation (RRE)] was performed by using a core collection of 150 accessions of rice landraces (i.e., Ting's rice core collection). Our results showed that the Ting's rice core collection possessed a wide-range of phenotypic variation for Al tolerance, and the index of Al tolerance (RRE) was ranged from 0.22 to 0.89. Moreover, the groups with different origins and compositions of indica and japonica rice showed different degrees of tolerance to varying levels of Al. These rice landraces were further screened with 274 simple sequence repeat markers, and association mapping was performed using a mixed linear model approach. The mapping results showed that a total of 23 significant (P < 0.05) trait-marker associations were detected for Al tolerance. Of these, three associations (13%) were identical to the quantitative trait loci reported previously, and other 20 associations were reported for the first time in this study. The proportion of phenotypic variance (R2) explained by 23 significant associations ranged from 5.03 to 20.03% for Al tolerance. We detected several elite alleles for Al tolerance based on multiple comparisons of allelic effects, which could be used to develop Al tolerant rice cultivars through marker-assisted breeding.
27720675	Cultivable Methylobacterium species diversity in rice seeds identified with whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis.	2017	J Biosci Bioeng	Methylobacterium species are methylotrophic bacteria that widely inhabit plant surfaces. In addition to studies on methylotrophs as model organisms, research has also been conducted on their mechanism of plant growth promotion as well as the species-species specificity of plant-microbe interaction. We employed whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (WC-MS) analysis, which enables the rapid and accurate identification of bacteria at the species level, to identify Methylobacterium isolates collected from the rice seeds of different cultivars harvested in Japan, Thailand, and Kenya. Rice seeds obtained from diverse geographical locations showed different communities of Methylobacterium species. We found that M. fujisawaense, M. aquaticum, M. platani, and M. radiotolerans are the most frequently isolated species, but none were isolated as common species from 18 seed samples due to the highly biased communities in some samples. These findings will contribute to the development of formulations containing selected species that promote rice growth, though it may be necessary to customize the formulations depending on the cultivars and farm conditions.
27722771	Rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 expression improves dietary iron and zinc levels in wheat.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Iron and zinc deficiencies negatively impact human health worldwide. We developed wheat lines that meet or exceed recommended dietary target levels for iron and zinc in the grains. These lines represent useful germplasm for breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce iron and zinc deficiency-associated health burdens in the affected populations. Micronutrient deficiencies, including iron and zinc deficiencies, have negative impacts on human health globally. Iron-deficiency; anemia affects nearly two billion people worldwide and is the cause of reduced cognitive development, fatigue and overall low productivity. Similarly, zinc deficiency causes stunted growth, decreased immunity and increased risk of respiratory infections. Biofortification of staple crops is a sustainable and effective approach to reduce the burden of health problems associated with micronutrient deficiencies. Here, we developed wheat lines expressing rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 (OsNAS2) and bean FERRITIN (PvFERRITIN) as single genes as well as in combination. NAS catalyzes the biosynthesis of nicotianamine (NA), which is a precursor of the iron chelator deoxymugeneic acid (DMA) required for long distance iron translocation. FERRITIN is important for iron storage in plants because it can store up to 4500 iron ions. We obtained significant increases of iron and zinc content in wheat grains of plants expressing either OsNAS2 or PvFERRTIN, or both genes. In particular, wheat lines expressing OsNAS2 greatly surpass the HarvestPlus recommended target level of 30 % dietary estimated average requirement (EAR) for iron, and 40 % of EAR for zinc, with lines containing 93.1 µg/g of iron and 140.6 µg/g of zinc in the grains. These wheat lines with dietary significant levels of iron and zinc represent useful germplasm for breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce micronutrient deficiencies in affected populations.
27704315	Lessons from the Far End: Caterpillar FRASS-Induced Defenses in Maize, Rice, Cabbage, and Tomato.	2016	J Chem Ecol	Plant defenses to insect herbivores have been studied in response to several insect behaviors on plants such as feeding, crawling, and oviposition. However, we have only scratched the surface about how insect feces induce plant defenses. In this study, we measured frass-induced plant defenses in maize, rice, cabbage, and tomato by chewing herbivores such as European corn borer (ECB), fall armyworm (FAW), cabbage looper (CL), and tomato fruit worm (TFW). We observed that caterpillar frass induced plant defenses are specific to each host-herbivore system, and they may induce herbivore or pathogen defense responses in the host plant depending on the composition of the frass deposited on the plant, the plant organ where it is deposited, and the species of insect. This study adds another layer of complexity in plant-insect interactions where analysis of frass-induced defenses has been neglected even in host-herbivore systems where naturally frass accumulates in enclosed feeding sites over extended periods of time.
27744227	Silicon improves rice grain yield and photosynthesis specifically when supplied during the reproductive growth stage.	2016	J Plant Physiol	Silicon (Si) has been recognized as a beneficial element to improve rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain yield. Despite some evidence suggesting that this positive effect is observed when Si is supplied along the reproductive growth stage (from panicle initiation to heading), it remains unclear whether its supplementation during distinct growth phases can differentially impact physiological aspects of rice and its yield and the underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the effects of additions/removals of Si at different growth stages and their impacts on rice yield components, photosynthetic performance, and expression of genes (Lsi1, Lsi2 and Lsi6) involved in Si distribution within rice shoots. Positive effects of Si on rice production and photosynthesis were manifested when it was specifically supplied during the reproductive growth stage, as demonstrated by: (1) a high crop yield associated with higher grain number and higher 1000-grain weight, whereas the leaf area and whole-plant biomass remained unchanged; (2) an increased sink strength which, in turn, exerted a feed-forward effect on photosynthesis that was coupled with increases in both stomatal conductance and biochemical capacity to fix CO2; (3) higher Si amounts in the developing panicles (and grain husks) in good agreement with a remarkable up-regulation of Lsi6 (and to a lesser extent Lsi1). We suggest that proper levels of Si in these reproductive structures seem to play an as yet unidentified role culminating with higher grain number and size.
27767093	Turning rice meiosis into mitosis.	2016	Cell Res	Introduction of clonal reproduction through seeds (apomixis) in crops has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by allowing self-propagation of any elite variety, in particular F1 hybrids. In the sexual model plant Arabidopsis thaliana synthetic clonal reproduction through seeds can be artificially implemented by (i) combining three mutations to turn meiosis into mitosis (MiMe) and (ii) crossing the obtained clonal gametes with a line expressing modified CENH3 and whose genome is eliminated in the zygote. Here we show that additional combinations of mutations can turn Arabidopsis meiosis into mitosis and that a combination of three mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) efficiently turns meiosis into mitosis, leading to the production of male and female clonal diploid gametes in this major crop. Successful implementation of the MiMe technology in the phylogenetically distant eudicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice opens doors for its application to any flowering plant and paves the way for introducing apomixis in crop species.
27807437	Genotype × Environment Interactions of Yield Traits in Backcross Introgression Lines Derived from <i>Oryza sativa</i> cv. Swarna/<i>Oryza nivara</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Advanced backcross introgression lines (BILs) developed from crosses of Oryza sativa var. Swarna/O. nivara accessions were grown and evaluated for yield and related traits. Trials were conducted for consecutive three seasons in field conditions in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data on yield traits under irrigated conditions were analyzed using the Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI), Genotype and Genotype × Environment Interaction (GGE) and modified rank-sum statistic (YSi) for yield stability. BILs viz., G3 (14S) and G6 (166S) showed yield stability across the seasons along with high mean yield performance. G3 is early in flowering with high yield and has good grain quality and medium height, hence could be recommended for most of the irrigated locations. G6 is a late duration genotype, with strong culm strength, high grain number and panicle weight. G6 has higher yield and stability than Swarna but has Swarna grain type. Among the varieties tested DRRDhan 40 and recurrent parent Swarna showed stability for yield traits across the seasons. The component traits thousand grain weight, panicle weight, panicle length, grain number and plant height explained highest genotypic percentage over environment and interaction factors and can be prioritized to dissect stable QTLs/ genes. These lines were genotyped using microsatellite markers covering the entire rice genome and also using a set of markers linked to previously reported yield QTLs. It was observed that wild derived lines with more than 70% of recurrent parent genome were stable and showed enhanced yield levels compared to genotypes with higher donor genome introgressions.
27694332	Energetics of acclimation to NaCl by submerged, anoxic rice seedlings.	2017	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our aim was to elucidate how plant tissues under a severe energy crisis cope with imposition of high NaCl, which greatly increases ion fluxes and hence energy demands. The energy requirements for ion regulation during combined salinity and anoxia were assessed to gain insights into ion transport processes in the anoxia-tolerant coleoptile of rice.

METHODS: We studied the combined effects of anoxia plus 50 or 100 mm NaCl on tissue ions and growth of submerged rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. Excised coleoptiles allowed measurements in aerated or anoxic conditions of ion net fluxes and O2 consumption or ethanol formation and by inference energy production.

KEY RESULTS: Over 80 h of anoxia, coleoptiles of submerged intact seedlings grew at 100 mm NaCl, but excised coleoptiles, with 50 mm exogenous glucose, survived only at 50 mm NaCl, possibly due to lower energy production with glucose than for intact coleoptiles with sucrose as substrate. Rates of net uptake of Na+ and Cl- by coleoptiles in anoxia were about half those in aerated solution. Ethanol formation in anoxia and O2 uptake in aerobic solution were each increased by 13-15 % at 50 mm NaCl, i.e. ATP formation was stimulated. For acclimation to 50 mm NaCl, the anoxic tissues used only 25 % of the energy that was expended by aerobic tissues. Following return of coleoptiles to aerated non-saline solution, rates of net K+ uptake recovered to those in continuously aerated solution, demonstrating there was little injury during anoxia with 50 mm NaCl.

CONCLUSION: Rice seedlings survive anoxia, without the coleoptile incurring significant injury, even with the additional energy demands imposed by NaCl (100 mm when intact, 50 mm when excised). Energy savings were achieved in saline anoxia by less coleoptile growth, reduced ion fluxes as compared to aerobic coleoptiles and apparent energy-economic ion transport systems.
27843741	Trace elements in native and improved paddy rice from different climatic regions of Sri Lanka: implications for public health.	2016	Springerplus	BACKGROUND: Samples of 226 new improved and 21 indigenous rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties were collected from the rice fields in three climatic zones of Sri Lanka and concentrations of 18 trace elements (Li, B, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Ba, Pb and Bi) were measured giving particular emphasis on Se, Cd and As using ICP-MS. The two way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) method was employed to identify the differences in composition among rice from different climatic zones.

RESULTS: The mean values obtained for both white and red rice were Se (36; 25 µg/kg), As (42; 45 µg/kg) and Cd (70; 123 µg/kg) on dry weight basis. However mean content of Se, As and Cd of native rice varieties were 69, 74 and 33 µg/kg, respectively. Statistical interpretations showed that in the majority of cases, there was a significant difference in Cd content among climatic zones whereas Se and Pb show differences between white and red rice varieties. Arsenic did not indicate any significant difference either between rice types or among climatic regions. Notably Se and As contents in indigenous rice were higher than that of improved rice types. To assess the safety of dietary of intake, daily intake of Se, Cd and As by rice were calculated. Non-gender specific Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of Se, Cd and As consuming improved rice are 9.31, 24.1 and 12.2 µg day-1, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Since over 50 % of daily meals of people contain rice or rice based products, Se intake is expected to be deficient among the Sri Lankan population.
27586643	Overexpression of PDH45 or SUV3 helicases in rice leads to delayed leaf senescence-associated events.	2017	Protoplasma	Senescence is a very complex process characterized by a highly regulated series of degenerative events which include changes in cell structure, metabolism and gene expression. In animals, one of the indicators of senescence is telomere shortening. In plants, this aspect is more puzzling because telomere shortening is not always correlated with senescence. In some cases, there were no differences in telomere length during plant developmental stages while in other cases both shortening and lengthening have been observed. Several genes involved in telomere homeostasis have been identified in plants, including some helicases. In the present study, the salinity stress-tolerant transgenic IR64 rice plants overexpressing the PDH45 (Pea DNA Helicase 45) or SUV3 (Suppressor of Var1-3) genes were used to test their performance during natural senescence at flowering (S2) and seed maturation (S4) developmental stages. Our results reveal that both PDH45 and SUV3 transgenic rice lines present decreased levels of necrosis/apoptosis as compared to wild type plants. Additionally, in these plants, some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were downregulated at S2 and S4 stages, while genes involved in the maintenance of genome stability and DNA repair were upregulated. More interestingly, the telomeres were up to 3.8-fold longer in the SUV3 overexpressing lines as compared to wild type plants. This was associated with an increase (2.5-fold) in telomerase (OsTERT) transcript level. This is an interesting result reporting a possible involvement of SUV3 in telomere homeostasis in plants.
27968990	An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Wax, cutin and sporopollenin are essential components for the formation of the anther cuticle and the pollen exine, respectively. Their lipid precursors are synthesized by secretory tapetal cells and transported to the anther and microspore surface for deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the anther cuticle and pollen exine are poorly understood in rice. Here, we characterized a rice male sterile mutant osabcg26. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed a point mutation in the gene encoding an ATP binding cassette transporter G26 (OsABCG26). OsABCG26 was specifically expressed in the anther and pistil. Cytological analysis revealed defects in tapetal cells, lipidic Ubisch bodies, pollen exine, and anther cuticle in the osabcg26 mutant. Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport. Additionally, wild-type pollen tubes showed a growth defect in osabcg26 pistils, leading to low seed setting in osabcg26 cross-pollinated with the wild-type pollen. These results indicated that OsABCG26 plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice.
27733859	Physiological Basis and Transcriptional Profiling of Three Salt-Tolerant Mutant Lines of Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Salinity is a complex trait that affects growth and productivity in many crops, including rice. Mutation induction, a useful tool to generate salt tolerant plants, enables the analysis of plants with similar genetic background, facilitating the understanding of the salt tolerance mechanisms. In this work, we generated three salt tolerant mutant lines by irradiation of a salt-sensitive cultivar plants and screened M2 plants at seedling stage in the presence of high salinity. These three lines, SaT20, SaS62, and SaT58, showed different responses to salinity, but exhibited similar phenotype to wild type plants, except SaT20 that displayed shorter height when grown in the absence of salt. Under salt conditions, all three mutants and the parental line showed similar reduction in yield, although relevant differences in other physiological parameters, such as Na+ accumulation in healthy leaves of SaT20, were registered. Microarray analyses of gene expression profiles in roots revealed the occurrence of common and specific responses in the mutants. The three mutants showed up-regulation of responsive genes, the activation of oxido-reduction process and the inhibition of ion transport. The participation of jasmonate in the plant response to salt was evident by down-regulation of a gene coding for a jasmonate O-methyltransferase. Genes dealing with lipid transport and metabolism were, in general, up-regulated except in SaS62, that also exhibited down-regulation of genes involved in ion transport and Ca2+ signal transduction. The two most tolerant varieties, SaS62 and SaT20, displayed lower levels of transcripts involved in K+ uptake. The physiological study and the description of the expression analysis evidenced that the three lines showed different responses to salt: SaT20 showed a high Na+ content in leaves, SaS62 presented an inhibition of lipid metabolism and ion transport and SaT58 differs in both features in the response to salinity. The analysis of these salt tolerant mutants illustrates the complexity of this trait evidencing the breadth of the plant responses to salinity including simultaneous cooperation of alternative or complementary mechanisms.
27795689	Identification and linkage analysis of a new rice bacterial blight resistance gene from XM14, a mutant line from IR24.	2016	Breed Sci	Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a chief factor limiting rice productivity worldwide. XM14, a rice mutant line resistant to Xoo, has been obtained by treating IR24, which is susceptible to six Philippine Xoo races and six Japanese Xoo races, with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. XM14 showed resistance to six Japanese Xoo races. The F2 population from XM14 × IR24 clearly showed 1 resistant : 3 susceptible segregation, suggesting control of resistance by a recessive gene. The approximate chromosomal location of the resistance gene was determined using 10 plants with shortest lesion length in the F2 population from XM14 × Koshihikari, which is susceptible to Japanese Xoo races. DNA marker-assisted analysis revealed that the gene was located on chromosome 3. IAS16 line carries IR24 genetic background with a Japonica cultivar Asominori segment of chromosome 3, on which the resistance gene locus was thought to be located. The F2 population from IAS16 × XM14 showed a discrete distribution. Linkage analysis indicated that the gene is located around the centromeric region. The resistance gene in XM14 was a new gene, named XA42. This gene is expected to be useful for resistance breeding programs and for genetic analysis of Xoo resistance.
27599761	DNA transposon activity is associated with increased mutation rates in genes of rice and other grasses.	2016	Nat Commun	DNA (class 2) transposons are mobile genetic elements which move within their 'host' genome through excising and re-inserting elsewhere. Although the rice genome contains tens of thousands of such elements, their actual role in evolution is still unclear. Analysing over 650 transposon polymorphisms in the rice species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, we find that DNA repair following transposon excisions is associated with an increased number of mutations in the sequences neighbouring the transposon. Indeed, the 3,000 bp flanking the excised transposons can contain over 10 times more mutations than the genome-wide average. Since DNA transposons preferably insert near genes, this is correlated with increases in mutation rates in coding sequences and regulatory regions. Most importantly, we find this phenomenon also in maize, wheat and barley. Thus, these findings suggest that DNA transposon activity is a major evolutionary force in grasses which provide the basis of most food consumed by humankind.
27614468	ER-localized adenine nucleotide transporter ER-ANT1: an integrator of energy and stress signaling in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Most environmental perturbations have a direct or indirect deleterious impact on photosynthesis, and, in consequence, the overall energy status of the cell. Despite our increased understanding of convergent energy and stress signals, the connections between photosynthesis, energy and stress signals through putative common nodes are still unclear. Here we identified an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized adenine nucleotide transporter1 (ER-ANT1), whose deficiency causes seedling lethality in air but viable under high CO2, exhibiting the typical photorespiratory phenotype. Metabolic analysis suggested that depletion of ER-ANT1 resulted in circadian rhythm disorders in sucrose synthesis and induced sucrose signaling pathways, indicating that the ER is involved in the regulation of vital energy metabolism in plants. In addition, the defect of ER-ANT1 triggers ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response in plant cells, suggesting ER stress and photorespiration are closely linked. These findings provide an important evidence for a key role of ER-localized ER-ANT1 in convergent energy and stress signals in rice. Our findings support the idea that ATP is a central signal involved in the plant response to a variety of stresses.
27646344	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) transcriptional factors constitute a large family with more than 150 members in rice and some of them have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in plant abiotic stress response. Here, we report the characterization of a rice stress-responsive NAC gene, ONAC095, and the exploration of its function in drought and cold stress tolerance.

RESULTS: Expression of ONAC095 was up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) but down-regulated by cold stress. ONAC095 protein had transactivation activity and the C2 domain in C-terminal was found to be critical for transactivation activity. Transgenic rice lines with overexpression of ONAC095 (ONAC095-OE) and dominant chimeric repressor-mediated suppression of ONAC095 (ONAC095-SRDX) were generated. The ONAC095-OE plants showed comparable phenotype to wild type under drought and cold stress conditions. However, the ONAC095-SRDX plants displayed an improved drought tolerance but exhibited an attenuated cold tolerance. The ONAC095-SRDX plants had decreased water loss rate, increased proline and soluble sugar contents, and up-regulated expression of drought-responsive genes under drought condition, whereas the ONAC095-SRDX plants accumulated excess reactive oxygen species, increased malondialdehyde content and down-regulated expression of cold-responsive genes under cold condition. Furthermore, ONAC095-SRDX plants showed an increased ABA sensitivity, contained an elevated ABA level, and displayed altered expression of ABA biosynthetic and metabolic genes as well as some ABA signaling-related genes.

CONCLUSION: Functional analyses through dominant chimeric repressor-mediated suppression of ONAC095 demonstrate that ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance, acting as a negative regulator of drought response but as a positive regulator of cold response in rice.
27703843	XA21-specific induction of stress-related genes following <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection of detached rice leaves.	2016	PeerJ	The rice XA21 receptor kinase confers robust resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaepv. oryzae (Xoo). We developed a detached leaf infection assay to quickly and reliably measure activation of the XA21-mediated immune response using genetic markers. We used RNA sequencing of elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP plants to identify candidate genes that could serve as markers for XA21 activation. From this analysis, we identified eight genes that are up-regulated in both in elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP rice leaves and Xoo infected XA21 rice leaves. These results provide a rapid and reliable method to assess bacterial-rice interactions.
27621428	The HvNramp5 Transporter Mediates Uptake of Cadmium and Manganese, But Not Iron.	2016	Plant Physiol	The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) represents a transporter family for metal ions in all organisms. Here, we functionally characterized a member of Nramp family in barley (Hordeum vulgare), HvNramp5. This member showed different expression patterns, transport substrate specificity, and cellular localization from its close homolog in rice (Oryza sativa), OsNramp5, although HvNramp5 was also localized to the plasma membrane. HvNramp5 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was not affected by Cd and deficiency of Zn, Cu, and Mn, but slightly up-regulated by Fe deficiency. Spatial expression analysis showed that the expression of HvNramp5 was higher in the root tips than that in the basal root regions. Furthermore, analysis with laser microdissection revealed higher expression of HvNramp5 in the outer root cell layers. HvNramp5 showed transport activity for both Mn2+ and Cd2+, but not for Fe2+ when expressed in yeast. Immunostaining with a HvNramp5 antibody showed that this protein was localized in the root epidermal cells without polarity. Knockdown of HvNramp5 in barley resulted in a significant reduction in the seedling growth at low Mn supply, but this reduction was rescued at high Mn supply. The concentration of Mn and Cd, but not other metals including Cu, Zn, and Fe, was decreased in both the roots and shoots of knockdown lines compared with the wild-type barley. These results indicate that HvNramp5 is a transporter required for uptake of Mn and Cd, but not for Fe, and that barley has a distinct uptake system from rice.
27622467	Building two indica rice reference genomes with PacBio long-read and Illumina paired-end sequencing data.	2016	Sci Data	Over the past 30 years, we have performed many fundamental studies on two Oryza sativa subsp. indica varieties, Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Minghui 63 (MH63). To improve the resolution of many of these investigations, we generated two reference-quality reference genome assemblies using the most advanced sequencing technologies. Using PacBio SMRT technology, we produced over 108 (ZS97) and 174 (MH63) Gb of raw sequence data from 166 (ZS97) and 209 (MH63) pools of BAC clones, and generated ~97 (ZS97) and ~74 (MH63) Gb of paired-end whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequence data with Illumina sequencing technology. With these data, we successfully assembled two platinum standard reference genomes that have been publicly released. Here we provide the full sets of raw data used to generate these two reference genome assemblies. These data sets can be used to test new programs for better genome assembly and annotation, aid in the discovery of new insights into genome structure, function, and evolution, and help to provide essential support to biological research in general.
27795687	Association between QTLs and morphological traits toward sheath blight resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2016	Breed Sci	Sheath blight is considered the most significant disease of rice and causes enormous yield losses over the world. Breeding for resistant varieties is the only viable option to combat the disease efficiently. Seventeen diverged rice genotypes along with 17 QTL-linked SSR markers were evaluated under greenhouse conditions. Pearson's correlation showed only the flag leaf angle had a significant correlation with sheath blight resistance under greenhouse screening. Multivariate analysis based on UPGMA clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the flag leaf angle, flag leaf length, and plant compactness were significantly associated with the following SSR marker alleles: RM209 (116,130), RM202 (176), RM224 (126), RM257 (156), RM426 (175), and RM6971 (196), which are linked to the SB QTLs: QRlh11, qSBR11-3, qSBR11-1, qSBR9-1, qShB3-2, and qSB-9. A Mantel test suggested a weak relationship between the observed phenotypes and allelic variation patterns, implying the independent nature of morphological and molecular variations. Teqing and Tetep were found to be the most resistant cultivars. IR65482-4-136-2-2, MR219-4, and MR264 showed improved resistance potentials. These results suggest that the morphological traits and QTLs which have been found to associate with sheath blight resistance are a good choice to enhance resistance through pyramiding either 2 QTLs or QTLs and traits in susceptible rice cultivars.
27643852	Differential deposition of H2A.Z in combination with histone modifications within related genes in Oryza sativa callus and seedling.	2017	Plant J	As a histone variant, H2A.Z is highly conserved among species and plays a significant role in diverse cellular processes. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of H2A.Z in Oryza sativa (rice) callus and seedling by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation using H2A.Z antibody and high-throughput sequencing. We found a significantly high peak and a small peak of H2A.Z distributed at the 5' and 3' ends of highly expressed genes, respectively. H2A.Z was also associated with inactive genes in both tissues. H3 lysine 4 trimethylation was associated with H2A.Z deposition at the 5' end of expressed genes, and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation peaks were partially associated with H2A.Z. In summary, our study provides global analysis data for the distribution of H2A.Z in the rice genome. Our results demonstrate that the differential deposition of H2A.Z might play important roles in gene transcription during rice development.
27618611	Gene replacements and insertions in rice by intron targeting using CRISPR-Cas9.	2016	Nat Plants	Sequence-specific nucleases have been exploited to create targeted gene knockouts in various plants(1), but replacing a fragment and even obtaining gene insertions at specific loci in plant genomes remain a serious challenge. Here, we report efficient intron-mediated site-specific gene replacement and insertion approaches that generate mutations using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Using a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting adjacent introns and a donor DNA template including the same pair of sgRNA sites, we achieved gene replacements in the rice endogenous gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) at a frequency of 2.0%. We also obtained targeted gene insertions at a frequency of 2.2% using a sgRNA targeting one intron and a donor DNA template including the same sgRNA site. Rice plants harbouring the OsEPSPS gene with the intended substitutions were glyphosate-resistant. Furthermore, the site-specific gene replacements and insertions were faithfully transmitted to the next generation. These newly developed approaches can be generally used to replace targeted gene fragments and to insert exogenous DNA sequences into specific genomic sites in rice and other plants.
27670771	Fine mapping of a new race-specific blast resistance gene Pi-hk2 in Japonica Heikezijing from Taihu region of China.	2016	Phytopathology	Heikezijing, a japonica rice landrace from Taihu region of China, exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to more than 300 isolates of the blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). In our previous research, we fine mapped a broad-spectrum resistance gene Pi-hk1 in chromosome 11. In this research, 2010-9(G1), one of the predominant race of the blast in Taihu Lake region of China, was inoculated into 162 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and two parents Heikezijing and Suyunuo for mapping the resistance-blast quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three QTLs Lsqtl4-1, Lsqtl9-1 and Lsqtl11-1 associated with lesion scores were detected on chromosomes 4, 9, and 11 and two QTLs, Lnqtl1-1 and Lnqtl9-1 associated with average lesion number on chromosomes 1 and 9. The QTL Lsqtl9-1 conferring race-specific resistance to 2010-9(G1) at seedling stages showed the logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores of 9.10 and phenotypic variance of 46.19% and might be a major QTL, named as Pi-hk2. The line RIL84 with Pi-hk2 derived from a cross between Heikezijing and Suyunuo was selected as Pi-hk2 gene donor for developing fine mapping populations. According to the resistance evaluation of recombinants of three generations (BC1F2, BC1F3 and BC1F4), Pi-hk2 was finally mapped to 143 kb region between ILP-19 and RM24048, and 18 candidate genes were predicted, including two pleiotropic drug resistance protein 4, one WRKY74, one cytochrome b5-like Heme/Steroid binding domain containing protein, one protein kinase and one ankyrin repeat family protein. These results provide essential information for cloning of Pi-hk2 and its potential utility in breeding resistant rice cultivars by marker-assisted selection.
27633505	The expression of heterologous Fe (III) phytosiderophore transporter HvYS1 in rice increases Fe uptake, translocation and seed loading and excludes heavy metals by selective Fe transport.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Many metal transporters in plants are promiscuous, accommodating multiple divalent cations including some which are toxic to humans. Previous attempts to increase the iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) content of rice endosperm by overexpressing different metal transporters have therefore led unintentionally to the accumulation of copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and cadmium (Cd). Unlike other metal transporters, barley Yellow Stripe 1 (HvYS1) is specific for Fe. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this preference by constitutively expressing HvYS1 in rice under the control of the maize ubiquitin1 promoter and comparing the mobilization and loading of different metals. Plants expressing HvYS1 showed modest increases in Fe uptake, root-to-shoot translocation, seed accumulation and endosperm loading, but without any change in the uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of Zn, Mn or Cu, confirming the selective transport of Fe. The concentrations of Zn and Mn in the endosperm did not differ significantly between the wild-type and HvYS1 lines, but the transgenic endosperm contained significantly lower concentrations of Cu. Furthermore, the transgenic lines showed a significantly reduced Cd uptake, root-to-shoot translocation and accumulation in the seeds. The underlying mechanism of metal uptake and translocation reflects the down-regulation of promiscuous endogenous metal transporters revealing an internal feedback mechanism that limits seed loading with Fe. This promotes the preferential mobilization and loading of Fe, therefore displacing Cu and Cd in the seed.
27600536	Morphogenic Regulators Baby boom and Wuschel Improve Monocot Transformation.	2016	Plant Cell	While transformation of the major monocot crops is currently possible, the process typically remains confined to one or two genotypes per species, often with poor agronomics, and efficiencies that place these methods beyond the reach of most academic laboratories. Here, we report a transformation approach involving overexpression of the maize (Zea mays) Baby boom (Bbm) and maize Wuschel2 (Wus2) genes, which produced high transformation frequencies in numerous previously non-transformable maize inbred lines. For example, the Pioneer inbred PHH5G is recalcitrant to biolistic and Agrobacterium transformation. However, when Bbm and Wus2 were expressed, transgenic calli were recovered from over 40% of the starting explants, with most producing healthy, fertile plants. Another limitation for many monocots is the intensive labor and greenhouse space required to supply immature embryos for transformation. This problem could be alleviated by using alternative target tissues that could be supplied consistently with automated preparation. As a major step toward this objective, we transformed Bbm and Wus2 directly into either embryo slices from mature seed or leaf segments from seedlings in a variety of Pioneer inbred lines, routinely recovering healthy, fertile T0 plants. Finally, we demonstrated that the maize Bbm and Wus2 genes stimulate transformation in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) immature embryos, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) callus, and indica rice (Oryza sativa var. indica) callus.
27606959	Rice Dwarf Virus P2 Protein Hijacks Auxin Signaling by Directly Targeting the Rice OsIAA10 Protein, Enhancing Viral Infection and Disease Development.	2016	PLoS Pathog	The phytohormone auxin plays critical roles in regulating myriads of plant growth and developmental processes. Microbe infection can disturb auxin signaling resulting in defects in these processes, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Auxin signaling begins with perception of auxin by a transient co-receptor complex consisting of an F-box transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) protein and an auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) protein. Auxin binding to the co-receptor triggers ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins, leading to subsequent events, including expression of auxin-responsive genes. Here we report that Rice dwarf virus (RDV), a devastating pathogen of rice, causes disease symptoms including dwarfing, increased tiller number and short crown roots in infected rice as a result of reduced sensitivity to auxin signaling. The RDV capsid protein P2 binds OsIAA10, blocking the interaction between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1 and inhibiting 26S proteasome-mediated OsIAA10 degradation. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing wild-type or a dominant-negative (degradation-resistant) mutant of OsIAA10 phenocopy RDV symptoms are more susceptible to RDV infection; however, knockdown of OsIAA10 enhances the resistance of rice to RDV infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of viral protein reprogramming of a key step in auxin signaling initiation that enhances viral infection and pathogenesis.
27658241	Genome-Wide Comparison of Magnaporthe Species Reveals a Host-Specific Pattern of Secretory Proteins and Transposable Elements.	None	PLoS One	Blast disease caused by the Magnaporthe species is a major factor affecting the productivity of rice, wheat and millets. This study was aimed at generating genomic information for rice and non-rice Magnaporthe isolates to understand the extent of genetic variation. We have sequenced the whole genome of the Magnaporthe isolates, infecting rice (leaf and neck), finger millet (leaf and neck), foxtail millet (leaf) and buffel grass (leaf). Rice and finger millet isolates infecting both leaf and neck tissues were sequenced, since the damage and yield loss caused due to neck blast is much higher as compared to leaf blast. The genome-wide comparison was carried out to study the variability in gene content, candidate effectors, repeat element distribution, genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and SNPs. The analysis of repeat element footprints revealed some genes such as naringenin, 2-oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase being targeted by Pot2 and Occan, in isolates from different host species. Some repeat insertions were host-specific while other insertions were randomly shared between isolates. The distributions of repeat elements, secretory proteins, CAZymes and SNPs showed significant variation across host-specific lineages of Magnaporthe indicating an independent genome evolution orchestrated by multiple genomic factors.
26747650	The binding versatility of plant acyl-CoA-binding proteins and their significance in lipid metabolism.	2016	Biochim Biophys Acta	Acyl-CoA esters are the activated form of fatty acids and play important roles in lipid metabolism and the regulation of cell functions. They are bound and transported by nonenzymic proteins such as the acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs). Although plant ACBPs were so named by virtue of amino acid homology to existing yeast and mammalian counterparts, recent studies revealed that ligand specificities of plant ACBPs are not restricted to acyl-CoA esters. Arabidopsis and rice ACBPs also interact with phospholipids, and their affinities to different acyl-CoA species and phospholipid classes vary amongst isoforms. Their ligands also include heavy metals. Interactors of plant ACBPs are further diversified due to the evolution of protein-protein interacting domains. This review summarizes our current understanding of plant ACBPs with a focus on their binding versatility. Their broad ligand range is of paramount significance in serving a multitude of functions during development and stress responses as discussed herein. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant Lipid Biology edited by Kent D. Chapman and Ivo Feussner.
27708655	Proteomic Analysis Reveals Different Involvement of Embryo and Endosperm Proteins during Aging of Yliangyou 2 Hybrid Rice Seeds.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Seed aging is a process that results in a delayed germination, a decreased germination percentage, and finally a total loss of seed viability. However, the mechanism of seed aging is poorly understood. In the present study, Yliangyou 2 hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds were artificially aged at 100% relative humidity and 40°C, and the effect of artificial aging on germination, germination time course and the change in protein profiles of embryo and endosperm was studied to understand the molecular mechanism behind seed aging. With an increasing duration of artificial aging, the germination percentage and germination rate of hybrid rice seeds decreased. By comparing the protein profiles from the seeds aged for 0, 10 and 25 days, a total of 91 and 100 protein spots were found to show a significant change of more than 2-fold (P < 0.05) in abundance, and 71 and 79 protein spots were identified, in embryos and endosperms, respectively. The great majority of these proteins increased in abundance in embryos (95%) and decreased in abundance in endosperms (99%). In embryos, most of the identified proteins were associated with energy (30%), with cell defense and rescue (28%), and with storage protein (18%). In endosperms, most of the identified proteins were involved in metabolism (37%), in energy (27%), and in protein synthesis and destination (11%). The most marked change was the increased abundance of many glycolytic enzymes together with the two fermentation enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in the embryos during aging. We hypothesize that the decreased viability of hybrid rice seeds during artificial aging is caused by the development of hypoxic conditions in the embryos followed by ethanol accumulation.
27695474	Genome-Wide Identification, Evolution, and Co-expression Network Analysis of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinases in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are the conserved and universal signal transduction modules in all eukaryotes, which play the vital roles in plant growth, development, and in response to multiple stresses. In this study, we used bioinformatics methods to identify 86 MAPKKK protein encoded by 73 MAPKKK genes in Brachypodium. Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKKK family from Arabidopsis, rice, and Brachypodium has classified them into three subfamilies, of which 28 belonged to MEKK, 52 to Raf, and 6 to ZIK subfamily, respectively. Conserved protein motif, exon-intron organization, and splicing intron phase in kinase domains supported the evolutionary relationships inferred from the phylogenetic analysis. And gene duplication analysis suggested the chromosomal segment duplication happened before the divergence of the rice and Brachypodium, while all of three tandem duplicated gene pairs happened after their divergence. We further demonstrated that the MAPKKKs have evolved under strong purifying selection, implying the conservation of them. The splicing transcripts expression analysis showed that the splicesome translating longest protein tended to be adopted. Furthermore, the expression analysis of BdMAPKKKs in different organs and development stages as well as heat, virus and drought stresses revealed that the MAPKKK genes were involved in various signaling pathways. And the circadian analysis suggested there were 41 MAPKKK genes in Brachypodium showing cycled expression in at least one condition, of which seven MAPKKK genes expressed in all conditions and the promoter analysis indicated these genes possessed many cis-acting regulatory elements involved in circadian and light response. Finally, the co-expression network of MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK in Brachypodium was constructed using 144 microarray and RNA-seq datasets, and ten potential MAPK cascades pathway were predicted. To conclude, our study provided the important information for evolutionary and functional characterization of MAPKKK family in Brachypodium, which will facilitate the functional analysis of BdMAPKKK genes, and also will facilitate better understanding the MAPK signal pathway in Brachypodium and beyond.
27693372	Characterization and comparative profiling of the small RNA transcriptomes in the Hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens.	2016	Gene	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small RNAs involved in various biological processes through negative regulation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is one of the most serious and destructive insect pests of rice. In the present study, two small RNA libraries of virulent N. lugens populations (Biotype I survives on susceptive rice variety TN1 and Biotype Y survives on moderately resistant rice variety YHY15) were constructed and sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing technology in order to identify the relationship between miRNAs of N.lugens and adaptation of BPH pests to rice resistance. In total 15,758,632 and 11,442,592 reads, corresponding to 3,144,026 and 2,550,049 unique sequences, were obtained in the two libraries (BPH-TN1 and BPH-YHY15 libraries), respectively. A total of 41 potential novel miRNAs were predicted in the two libraries, and 26 miRNAs showed significantly differential expression between two libraries. All miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in the BPH-TN1 library. Target genes likely regulated by these differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using computational prediction. The functional annotation of target genes performed by Gene Ontology enrichment (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis (KEGG) indicated that a majority of differential miRNAs were involved in "Metabolism" pathway. These results provided an understanding of the role of miRNAs in BPH to adaptability of BPH on rice resistance, and will be useful in developing new control strategies for host defense against BPH.
27677708	Improving protein content and quality by over-expressing artificially synthetic fusion proteins with high lysine and threonine constituent in rice plants.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice grains are rich in starch but low in protein with very low level of both lysine and threonine. Thus, it is important to further improve protein quality and quantity, especially to increase lysine and threonine content in rice grains. We artificially synthesized two new genes by fusing endogenous rice genes with lysine (K)/threonine (T) motif (TKTKK) coding sequences. They were designated as TKTKK1 and TKTKK2 and their encoded proteins consist of 73.1% and 83.5% of lysine/threonine, respectively. These two genes were under the control of 35S promoter and were independently introduced into the rice genome to generate transgenic plants. Our data showed that overexpression of TKTKK1 generated stable proteins with expected molecular weight and the transgenic rice seeds significantly increased lysine, threonine, total amino acids and crude protein content by 33.87%, 21.21%, 19.43% and 20.45%, respectively when compared with wild type control; significant improvement was also observed in transgenic rice seeds overexpressing TKTKK2. However, limited improvement in protein quality and quantity was observed in transgenic seeds carrying tandom array of these two new genes. Our data provide the basis and alternative strategy on further improving protein quality and quantity in other crops or vegetable plants by synthetic biology.
27708650	A Novel <i>FC116</i>/<i>BC10</i> Mutation Distinctively Causes Alteration in the Expression of the Genes for Cell Wall Polymer Synthesis in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	We report isolation and characterization of a fragile culm mutant fc116 that displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered cell wall structure in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that fc116 was a base substitution mutant (G to A) in a putative beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) gene (LOC_Os05g07790, allelic to BC10). This mutation resulted in one amino acid missing within a newly-identified protein motif "R, RXG, RA." The FC116/BC10 gene was lowly but ubiquitously expressed in the all tissues examined across the whole life cycle of rice, and slightly down-regulated during secondary growth. This mutant also exhibited a significant increase in the content of hemicelluloses and lignins, as well as the content of pentoses (xylose and arabinose). But the content of hexoses (glucose, mannose, and galactose) was decreased in both cellulosic and non-cellulosic (pectins and hemicelluloses) fractions of the mutant. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that the typical genes in the fc116 mutant were up-regulated corresponding to xylan biosynthesis, as well as lignin biosynthesis including p-hydroxyphenyl (H), syringyl (S), and guaiacyl (G). Our results indicate that FC116 has universal function in regulation of the cell wall polymers in rice.
27605490	Involvement of type VI secretion system in secretion of iron chelator pyoverdine in Pseudomonas taiwanensis.	2016	Sci Rep	Rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. Therefore, in addition to breeding disease-resistant rice cultivars, it is desirable to develop effective biocontrol agents against Xoo. Here, we report that a soil bacterium Pseudomonas taiwanensis displayed strong antagonistic activity against Xoo. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry, we identified an iron chelator, pyoverdine, secreted by P. taiwanensis that could inhibit the growth of Xoo. Through Tn5 mutagenesis of P. taiwanensis, we showed that mutations in genes that encode components of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) as well as biosynthesis and maturation of pyoverdine resulted in reduced toxicity against Xoo. Our results indicated that T6SS is involved in the secretion of endogenous pyoverdine. Mutations in T6SS component genes affected the secretion of mature pyoverdine from the periplasmic space into the extracellular medium after pyoverdine precursor is transferred to the periplasm by the inner membrane transporter PvdE. In addition, we also showed that other export systems, i.e., the PvdRT-OpmQ and MexAB-OprM efflux systems (for which there have been previous suggestions of involvement) and the type II secretion system (T2SS), are not involved in pyoverdine secretion.
27647523	Transcriptomic comparison between Brassica oleracea and rice (Oryza sativa) reveals diverse modulations on cell death in response to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.	2016	Sci Rep	Sclerotinia stem rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease of Brassica crops, but not in rice. The leaves of a rice line, a partial resistant (R) and a susceptible (S) Brassica oleracea pool that bulked from a resistance-segregating F2 population were employed for transcriptome sequencing before and after inoculation by S. sclerotiorum for 6 and 12 h. Distinct transcriptome profiles were revealed between B. oleracea and rice in response to S. sclerotiorum. Enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG indicated an enhancement of antioxidant activity in the R B. oleracea and rice, and histochemical staining exhibited obvious lighter reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cell death in rice and the R B. oleracea as compared to that in the S B. oleracea. Significant enhancement of Ca(2+) signalling, a positive regulator of ROS and cell death, were detected in S B. oleracea after inoculation, while it was significantly repressed in the R B. oleracea group. Obvious difference was detected between two B. oleracea groups for WRKY transcription factors, particularly for those regulating cell death. These findings suggest diverse modulations on cell death in host in response to S. sclerotiorum. Our study provides useful insight into the resistant mechanism to S. sclerotiorum.
27795679	A practical, rapid generation-advancement system for rice breeding using simplified biotron breeding system.	2016	Breed Sci	A new plant breeding method-the biotron breeding system (BBS)-can rapidly produce advanced generations in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding. This method uses a growth chamber (biotron) with CO2 control, accompanied by tiller removal and embryo rescue to decrease the period before seed maturity. However, tiller removal and embryo rescue are laborious and impractical for large populations. We investigated the influences of increased CO2, tiller removal, and root restriction on the days to heading (DTH) from seeding in growth chambers. The higher CO2 concentration significantly decreased DTH, but tiller removal and root restriction had little effect on DTH and drastically reduced seed yield. Based on these findings, we propose a simplified BBS (the sBBS) that eliminates the need for tiller removal and embryo rescue, but controls CO2 levels and day-length and maintains an appropriate root volume. Using the sBBS, we could reduce the interval between generations in 'Nipponbare' to less than 3 months, without onerous manipulations. To demonstrate the feasibility of the sBBS, we used it to develop isogenic lines using 'Oborozuki' as the donor parent for the low-amylose allele Wx1-1 and 'Akidawara' as the recipient. We were able to perform four crossing cycles in a year.
27671164	Analysis of Allelic Imbalance in Rice Hybrids Under Water Stress and Association of Asymmetrically Expressed Genes with Drought-Response QTLs.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Information on the effect of stress on the allele-specific expression (ASE) profile of rice hybrids is limited. More so, the association of allelically imbalanced genes to important traits is yet to be understood. Here we assessed allelic imbalance (AI) in the heterozygote state of rice under non- and water-stress treatments and determined association of asymmetrically expressed genes with grain yield (GY) under drought stress by in-silico co-localization analysis and selective genotyping. The genotypes IR64, Apo and their F1 hybrid (IR64 × Apo) were grown under normal and water-limiting conditions. We sequenced the total RNA transcripts for all genotypes then reconstructed the two chromosomes in the heterozygote.

RESULTS: We are able to estimate the transcript abundance of and the differential expression (DE) between the two parent-specific alleles in the rice hybrids. The magnitude and direction of AI are classified into two categories: (1) symmetrical or biallelic and (2) asymmetrical. The latter can be further classified as either IR64- or Apo-favoring gene. Analysis showed that in the hybrids grown under non-stress conditions, 179 and 183 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively. Hence, the number of IR64- and Apo-favoring genes is relatively equal. Under water-stress conditions, 179 and 255 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively, indicating that the number of allelically imbalanced genes is skewed towards IR64. This is nearly 40-60 % preference for Apo and IR64 alleles, respectively, to the hybrid transcriptome. We also observed genes which exhibit allele preference switching when exposed to water-stress conditions. Results of in-silico co-localization procedure and selective genotyping of Apo/IR64 F3:5 progenies revealed significant association of several asymmetrically expressed genes with GY under drought stress conditions.

CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that water stress skews AI on a genome-wide scale towards the IR64 allele, the cross-specific maternal allele. Several asymmetrically expressed genes are strongly associated with GY under drought stress which may shed hints that genes associated with important traits are allelically imbalanced. Our approach of integrating hybrid expression analysis and QTL mapping analysis may be an efficient strategy for shortlisting candidate genes for gene discovery.
27746792	Genome-Wide Identification and Evolution Analysis of Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthase Gene Family in <i>Nelumbo nucifera</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) plays a key role in plant carbohydrate metabolism and the perception of carbohydrate availability. In the present work, the publicly available Nelumbo nucifera (lotus) genome sequence database was analyzed which led to identification of nine lotus TPS genes (NnTPS). It was found that at least two introns are included in the coding sequences of NnTPS genes. When the motif compositions were analyzed we found that NnTPS generally shared the similar motifs, implying that they have similar functions. The dN /dS ratios were always less than 1 for different domains and regions outside domains, suggesting purifying selection on the lotus TPS gene family. The regions outside TPS domain evolved relatively faster than NnTPS domains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using all predicted coding sequences of lotus TPS genes, together with those from Arabidopsis, poplar, soybean, and rice. The result indicated that those TPS genes could be clearly divided into two main subfamilies (I-II), where each subfamily could be further divided into 2 (I) and 5 (II) subgroups. Analyses of divergence and adaptive evolution show that purifying selection may have been the main force driving evolution of plant TPS genes. Some of the critical sites that contributed to divergence may have been under positive selection. Transcriptome data analysis revealed that most NnTPS genes were predominantly expressed in sink tissues. Expression pattern of NnTPS genes under copper and submergence stress indicated that NNU_014679 and NNU_022788 might play important roles in lotus energy metabolism and participate in stress response. Our results can facilitate further functional studies of TPS genes in lotus.
27608922	Genomic identification, characterization and differential expression analysis of SBP-box gene family in Brassica napus.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: SBP-box genes belong to one of the largest families of transcription factors. Though members of this family have been characterized to be important regulators of diverse biological processes, information of SBP-box genes in the third most important oilseed crop Brassica napus is largely undefined.

RESULTS: In the present study, by whole genome bioinformatics analysis and transcriptional profiling, 58 putative members of SBP-box gene family in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) were identified and their expression pattern in different tissues as well as possible interaction with miRNAs were analyzed. In addition, B. napus lines with contrasting branch angle were used for investigating the involvement of SBP-box genes in plant architecture regulation. Detailed gene information, including genomic organization, structural feature, conserved domain and phylogenetic relationship of the genes were systematically characterized. By phylogenetic analysis, BnaSBP proteins were classified into eight distinct groups representing the clear orthologous relationships to their family members in Arabidopsis and rice. Expression analysis in twelve tissues including vegetative and reproductive organs showed different expression patterns among the SBP-box genes and a number of the genes exhibit tissue specific expression, indicating their diverse functions involved in the developmental process. Forty-four SBP-box genes were ascertained to contain the putative miR156 binding site, with 30 and 14 of the genes targeted by miR156 at the coding and 3'UTR region, respectively. Relative expression level of miR156 is varied across tissues. Different expression pattern of some BnaSBP genes and the negative correlation of transcription levels between miR156 and its target BnaSBP gene were observed in lines with different branch angle.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study represents the first systematic analysis of the SBP-box gene family in Brassica napus. The data presented here provides base foundation for understanding the crucial roles of BnaSBP genes in plant development and other biological processes.
27682162	Map-based Cloning and Characterization of the BPH18 Gene from Wild Rice Conferring Resistance to Brown Planthopper (BPH) Insect Pest.	2016	Sci Rep	Brown planthopper (BPH) is a phloem sap-sucking insect pest of rice which causes severe yield loss. We cloned the BPH18 gene from the BPH-resistant introgression line derived from the wild rice species Oryza australiensis. Map-based cloning and complementation test revealed that the BPH18 encodes CC-NBS-NBS-LRR protein. BPH18 has two NBS domains, unlike the typical NBS-LRR proteins. The BPH18 promoter::GUS transgenic plants exhibited strong GUS expression in the vascular bundles of the leaf sheath, especially in phloem cells where the BPH attacks. The BPH18 proteins were widely localized to the endo-membranes in a cell, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network, and prevacuolar compartments, suggesting that BPH18 may recognize the BPH invasion at endo-membranes in phloem cells. Whole genome sequencing of the near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-BPH18 and NIL-BPH26, revealed that BPH18 located at the same locus of BPH26. However, these two genes have remarkable sequence differences and the independent NILs showed differential BPH resistance with different expression patterns of plant defense-related genes, indicating that BPH18 and BPH26 are functionally different alleles. These findings would facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanism of BPH resistance and the identified novel alleles to fast track breeding BPH resistant rice cultivars.
27683727	The role of OsPT8 in arsenate uptake and varietal difference in arsenate tolerance in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	Arsenic (As) contamination in paddy soil can cause phytotoxicity and elevated As accumulation in rice grain. Rice varieties vary in As uptake and tolerance, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the aus variety Kasalath was found to be more tolerant to arsenate [As(V)] than the japonica variety Nipponbare, but the two varieties showed similar arsenite [As(III)] tolerance. Nipponbare took up more phosphate (Pi) and As(V) than Kasalath. The expression of genes for Pi transporters or Pi homeostasis regulation was quantified. Nipponbare showed 2- to 3-fold higher expression of the Pi transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 than Kasalath. Two ospt8 mutants were isolated from the Kasalath background and compared with an ospt8 mutant in the Nipponbare background. Mutation in OsPT8 in both backgrounds decreased As(V) uptake by 33-57%, increased As(V) tolerance assayed by root elongation by >100-fold, and abolished the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance. The results show that OsPT8 plays a key role in As(V) uptake and that As(V) uptake mediated by OsPT8 exerts a profound toxic effect on root elongation. The results also suggest that differential OsPT8 expression explains the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance between Kasalath and Nipponbare.
27620639	Mapping quantitative trait loci responsible for resistance to Bakanae disease in rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Bakanae or foot rot disease caused by Fusarium fujikuroi [teleomorph: Gibberella fujikuroi (Sawada) Ito] is emerging as a serious disease in rice. The disease causes both quantitative and qualitative losses to the grains under the field conditions. Breeding for resistance to Bakanae disease is a promising strategy to manage this emerging disease. In this study, we used a population of 168 F14 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two indica rice parents Pusa 1342, a highly resistant variety and Pusa Basmati 1121, a highly susceptible variety to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing resistance against Bakanae disease.

RESULTS: The disease reaction of 168 F14 RILs were measured on the seedlings inoculated using Fusarium fujikuroi culture using high-throughput screening protocol under glasshouse conditions. Utilizing inclusive composite interval mapping, three QTLs governing resistance to Bakanae were identified, namely qBK1.1, qBK1.2 and qBK1.3 which accounted 4.76, 24.74 and 6.49 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. The major effect QTL designated qBK1.2 was mapped in 0.26 Mb region between RM5336 and RM10153. A total of 55 annotated genes were identified within the identified QTL region qBK1.2.

CONCLUSIONS: The novel QTLs identified in this study are useful resource for efficiently breeding rice cultivars resistant to Bakanae disease. This is the first report on identification of QTLs governing resistance against Bakanae in rice using inclusive composite interval mapping strategy in a RIL population.
27706742	Characterization and gene cloning of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) dwarf and narrow-leaf mutant dnl3.	2016	Genet Mol Res	The dwarf and narrow-leaf rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant dnl3 was isolated from the Japonica cultivar Zhonghua 11 (wild-type). dnl3 exhibited pleiotropic developmental defects. The narrow-leaf phenotype resulted from a marked reduction in the number of vascular bundles, while the dwarf stature was caused by the formation of foreshortened internodes and a reduced number of parenchyma cells. The suggestion that cell division is impaired in the mutant was consistent with the transcriptional behavior of various genes associated with cell division. The mutant was less responsive to exogenously supplied gibberellic acid than the wild-type, and profiling the transcription of genes involved in gibberellin synthesis and response revealed that a lesion in the mutant affected gibberellin signal transduction. The dnl3 phenotype was inherited as a single-dominant gene, mapping within a 19.1-kb region of chromosome 12, which was found to harbor three open reading frames. Resequencing the open reading frames revealed that the mutant carried an allele at one of the three genes that differed from the wild-type sequence by 2-bp deletions; this gene encoded a cellulose synthase-like D4 (CSLD4) protein. Therefore, OsCSLD4 is a candidate gene for DNL3. DNL3 was expressed in all of the rice organs tested at the heading stage, particularly in the leaves, roots, and culms. These results suggest that DNL3 plays important roles in rice leaf morphogenesis and vegetative development.
27721133	Gibberellins producing Bacillus methylotrophicus KE2 supports plant growth and enhances nutritional metabolites and food values of lettuce.	2016	Plant Physiol Biochem	The nutritional quality of green leafy vegetables can be enhanced by application of plant beneficial micro-organisms. The present study was aimed to increase the food values of lettuce leaves by bacterial treatment. We isolated bacterial strain KE2 from Kimchi food and identified as Bacillus methylotrophicus by phylogenetic analysis. The beneficial effect of B. methylotrophicus KE2 on plants was confirmed by increasing the percentage of seed germination of Lactuca sativa L., Cucumis melo L., Glycine max L. and Brassica juncea L. It might be the secretion of array of gibberellins (GA1, GA3, GA7, GA8, GA9, GA12, GA19, GA20, GA24, GA34 and GA53) and indole-acetic acid from B. methylotrophicus KE2. The mechanism of plant growth promotion via their secreted metabolites was confirmed by a significant increase of GA deficient mutant rice plant growth. Moreover, the bacterial association was favor to enhance shoot length, shoot fresh weight and leaf width of lettuce. The higher concentration of protein, amino acids (Asp, Thr, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Leu, Tyr and His), gama-aminobutric acid and fructose was found in bacterial culture (KE2) applied plants. The macro and micro minerals such as K, Mg, Na, P, Fe, Zn and N were also detected as significantly higher quantities in bacteria treated plants than untreated control plants. In addition, the carotenoids and chlorophyll a were also increased in lettuce at bacterial inoculation. The results of this study suggest that B. methylotrophicus KE2 application to soil helps to increase the plant growth and food values of lettuce.
27670819	Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones.	2016	Plant Physiol	The cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that RAMOSUS3, a pea ortholog of D14, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the transport of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 transport weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular transport of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.
27681580	Transcriptional regulatory mechanism of alcohol dehydrogenase 1-deficient mutant of rice for cell survival under complete submergence.	2016	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is the only crop that germinates and elongates the coleoptile under complete submergence. It has been shown that alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)-deficient mutant of rice with reduced alcohol dehydrogenase activity (rad) and reduced ATP level, is viable with much reduced coleoptile elongation under such condition. To understand the altered transcriptional regulatory mechanism of this mutant, we aimed to establish possible relationships between gene expression and cis-regulatory information content.

FINDINGS: We performed promoter analysis of the publicly available differentially expressed genes in ADH1 mutant. Our results revealed that a crosstalk between a number of key transcription factors (TFs) and different phytohormones altered transcriptional regulation leading to the survival of the mutant. Amongst the key TFs identified, we suggest potential involvement of MYB, bZIP, ARF and ERF as transcriptional activators and WRKY, ABI4 and MYC as transcriptional repressors of coleoptile elongation to maintain metabolite levels for the cell viability. Out of the repressors, WRKY TF is most likely playing a major role in the alteration of the physiological implications associated with the cell survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our analysis provides a possible transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlying the survival of the rad mutant under complete submergence in an energy crisis condition and develops hypotheses for further experimental validation.
27616208	Linking hydrogen-mediated boron toxicity tolerance with improvement of root elongation, water status and reactive oxygen species balance: a case study for rice.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Boron is essential for plant growth but hazardous when present in excess. As the antioxidant properties of hydrogen gas (H2) were recently described in plants, oxidative stress induced by excess boron was investigated along with other biological responses during rice (Oryza sativa) seed germination to study the beneficial role of H2 METHODS: Rice seeds were pretreated with exogenous H2 Using physiological, pharmacological and molecular approaches, the production of endogenous H2, growth status, reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and relative gene expression in rice were measured under boron stress to investigate mechanisms of H2-mediated boron toxicity tolerance.

KEY RESULTS: In our test, boron-inhibited seed germination and seedling growth, and endogenous H2 production, were obviously blocked by exogenously applying H2 The re-establishment of ROS balance was confirmed by reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS accumulation. Meanwhile, activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) were increased. Suppression of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity and downregulation of PME transcripts by H2 were consistent with the alleviation of root growth inhibition caused by boron. Water status was improved as well. This result was confirmed by the upregulation of genes encoding specific aquaporins (AQPs), the maintenance of low osmotic potential and high content of soluble sugar. Increased transcription of representative AQP genes (PIP2;7 in particular) and BOR2 along with decreased BOR1 mRNA may contribute to lowering boron accumulation.

CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen provides boron toxicity tolerance mainly by improving root elongation, water status and ROS balance.
27681945	Genome-wide identification and characterization of tRNA-derived RNA fragments in land plants.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: The manuscript by Alves et al. entitled "Genome-wide identification and characterization of tRNA-derived RNA fragments in land plants" describes the identification and characterization of tRNAderived sRNA fragments in plants. By combining bioinformatic analysis and genetic and molecular approaches, we show that tRF biogenesis does not rely on canonical microRNA/siRNA processing machinery (i.e., independent of DICER-LIKE proteins). Moreover, we provide evidences that the Arabidopsis S-like Ribonuclease 1 (RNS1) might be involved in the biogenesis of tRFs. Detailed analyses showed that plant tRFs are sorted into different types of ARGONAUTE proteins and that they have potential target candidate genes. Our work advances the understanding of the tRF biology in plants by providing evidences that plant and animal tRFs shared common features and raising the hypothesis that an interplay between tRFs and other sRNAs might be important to fine-tune gene expression and protein biosynthesis in plant cells. Small RNA (sRNA) fragments derived from tRNAs (3'-loop, 5'-loop, anti-codon loop), named tRFs, have been reported in several organisms, including humans and plants. Although they may interfere with gene expression, their biogenesis and biological functions in plants remain poorly understood. Here, we capitalized on small RNA sequencing data from distinct species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Physcomitrella patens to examine the diversity of plant tRFs and provide insight into their properties. In silico analyzes of 19 to 25-nt tRFs derived from 5' (tRF-5s) and 3'CCA (tRF-3s) tRNA loops in these three evolutionary distant species showed that they are conserved and their abundance did not correlate with the number of genomic copies of the parental tRNAs. Moreover, tRF-5 is the most abundant variant in all three species. In silico and in vivo expression analyses unraveled differential accumulation of tRFs in Arabidopsis tissues/organs, suggesting that they are not byproducts of tRNA degradation. We also verified that the biogenesis of most Arabidopsis 19-25 nt tRF-5s and tRF-3s is not primarily dependent on DICER-LIKE proteins, though they seem to be associated with ARGONAUTE proteins and have few potential targets. Finally, we provide evidence that Arabidopsis ribonuclease RNS1 might be involved in the processing and/or degradation of tRFs. Our data support the notion that an interplay between tRFs and other sRNAs might be important to fine tune gene expression and protein biosynthesis in plant cells.
27659322	Genomewide analysis of the lateral organ boundaries domain gene family in Vitis vinifera.	2016	J Genet	In plants, the transcription factor families have been implicated in many important biological processes. These processes include morphogenesis, signal transduction and environmental stress responses. Proteins containing the lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD), which encodes a zinc finger-like domain are only found in plants. This finding indicates that this unique gene family regulates only plant-specific biological processes. LBD genes play crucial roles in the growth and development of plants such as Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, poplar, apple and tomato. However, relatively little is known about the LBD genes in grape (Vitis vinifera). In this study, we identified 40 LBD genes in the grape genome. A complete overview of the chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, structures and expression profiles of this gene family during development in grape is presented here. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the LBD genes could be divided into classes I and II, together with LBDs from Arabidopsis. We mapped the 40 LBD genes on the grape chromosomes (chr1-chr19) and found that 37 of the predicted grape LBD genes were distributed in different densities across 12 chromosomes. Grape LBDs were found to share a similar intron/exon structure and gene length within the same class. The expression profiles of grape LBD genes at different developmental stages were analysed using microarray data. Results showed that 21 grape LBD genes may be involved in grape developmental processes, including preveraison, veraison and ripening. Finally, we analysed the expression patterns of six LBD genes through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reation analysis. The six LBD genes showed differential expression patterns among the three representative grape tissues, and five of these genes were found to be involved in responses to mannitol, sodium chloride, heat stress and low temperature treatments. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the LBD gene family in grape and provides valuable information for classification and functional investigation of this gene family.
27653809	Leaf anatomy mediates coordination of leaf hydraulic conductance and mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> in Oryza.	2017	New Phytol	Leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf ) and mesophyll conductance (gm ) both represent major constraints to photosynthetic rate (A), and previous studies have suggested that Kleaf and gm is correlated in leaves. However, there is scarce empirical information about their correlation. In this study, Kleaf , leaf hydraulic conductance inside xylem (Kx ), leaf hydraulic conductance outside xylem (Kox ), A, stomatal conductance (gs ), gm , and anatomical and structural leaf traits in 11 Oryza genotypes were investigated to elucidate the correlation of H2 O and CO2 diffusion inside leaves. All of the leaf functional and anatomical traits varied significantly among genotypes. Kleaf was not correlated with the maximum theoretical stomatal conductance calculated from stomatal dimensions (gsmax ), and neither gs nor gsmax were correlated with Kx . Moreover, Kox was linearly correlated with gm and both were closely related to mesophyll structural traits. These results suggest that Kleaf and gm are related to leaf anatomical and structural features, which may explain the mechanism for correlation between gm and Kleaf .
27703460	Combining Image Analysis, Genome Wide Association Studies and Different Field Trials to Reveal Stable Genetic Regions Related to Panicle Architecture and the Number of Spikelets per Panicle in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Number of spikelets per panicle (NSP) is a key trait to increase yield potential in rice (O. sativa). The architecture of the rice inflorescence which is mainly determined by the length and number of primary (PBL and PBN) and secondary (SBL and SBN) branches can influence NSP. Although several genes controlling panicle architecture and NSP in rice have been identified, there is little evidence of (i) the genetic control of panicle architecture and NSP in different environments and (ii) the presence of stable genetic associations with panicle architecture across environments. This study combines image phenotyping of 225 accessions belonging to a genetic diversity array of indica rice grown under irrigated field condition in two different environments and Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) based on the genotyping of the diversity panel, providing 83,374 SNPs. Accessions sown under direct seeding in one environement had reduced Panicle Length (PL), NSP, PBN, PBL, SBN, and SBL compared to those established under transplanting in the second environment. Across environments, NSP was significantly and positively correlated with PBN, SBN and PBL. However, the length of branches (PBL and SBL) was not significantly correlated with variables related to number of branches (PBN and SBN), suggesting independent genetic control. Twenty- three GWAS sites were detected with P ≤ 1.0E-04 and 27 GWAS sites with p ≤ 5.9E-04. We found 17 GWAS sites related to NSP, 10 for PBN and 11 for SBN, 7 for PBL and 11 for SBL. This study revealed new regions related to NSP, but only three associations were related to both branching number (PBN and SBN) and NSP. Two GWAS sites associated with SBL and SBN were stable across contrasting environments and were not related to genes previously reported. The new regions reported in this study can help improving NSP in rice for both direct seeded and transplanted conditions. The integrated approach of high-throughput phenotyping, multi-environment field trials and GWAS has the potential to dissect complex traits, such as NSP, into less complex traits and to match single nucleotide polymorphisms with relevant function under different environments, offering a potential use for molecular breeding.
27652777	Structure and catalytic mechanism of monodehydroascorbate reductase, MDHAR, from Oryza sativa L. japonica.	2016	Sci Rep	Ascorbic acid (AsA) maintains redox homeostasis by scavenging reactive oxygen species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, especially plants. The enzyme monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) regenerates AsA by catalysing the reduction of monodehydroascorbate, using NADH or NADPH as an electron donor. The detailed recycling mechanism of MDHAR remains unclear due to lack of structural information. Here, we present the crystal structures of MDHAR in the presence of cofactors, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), and complexed with AsA as well as its analogue, isoascorbic acid (ISD). The overall structure of MDHAR is similar to other iron-sulphur protein reductases, except for a unique long loop of 63-80 residues, which seems to be essential in forming the active site pocket. From the structural analysis and structure-guided point mutations, we found that the Arg320 residue plays a major substrate binding role, and the Tyr349 residue mediates electron transfer from NAD(P)H to bound substrate via FAD. The enzymatic activity of MDHAR favours NADH as an electron donor over NADPH. Our results show, for the first time, structural insights into this preference. The MDHAR-ISD complex structure revealed an alternative binding conformation of ISD, compared with the MDHAR-AsA complex. This implies a broad substrate (antioxidant) specificity and resulting greater protective ability of MDHAR.
27578792	Jasmonate regulates juvenile-to-adult phase transition in rice.	2016	Development	Juvenile-to-adult phase transition is an important shift for the acquisition of adult vegetative characteristics and subsequent reproductive competence. We identified a recessive precocious (pre) mutant exhibiting a long leaf phenotype in rice. The long leaf phenotype is conspicuous in the second to the fourth leaves, which are juvenile and juvenile-to-adult transition leaves. We found that morphological and physiological traits, such as midrib formation, shoot meristem size, photosynthetic rate and plastochron, in juvenile and juvenile-to-adult transition stages of the pre mutant have precociously acquired adult characteristics. In agreement with these results, expression patterns of miR156 and miR172, which are microRNAs regulating phase change, support the accelerated juvenile-to-adult phase change in the pre mutant. The mutated gene encodes an allene oxide synthase (OsAOS1), which is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). The pre mutant showed a low level of JA and enhanced sensitivity to gibberellic acid, which promotes the phase change in some plant species. We also show that prolonged plastochron in the pre mutant is caused by accelerated PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1) function. The present study reveals a substantial role of JA as a negative regulator of vegetative phase change.
27795683	Genetic diversity of the <i>wx</i> flanking region in rice landraces in northern Laos.	2016	Breed Sci	A glutinous texture of endosperm is one of the important traits of rice (Oyza sativa L.). Northern Laos is known as a center of glutinous rice diversity. We genotyped INDEL, SSR and SNP markers in a sample of 297 rice landraces collected in northern Laos. These glutinous varieties were confirmed to share a loss-of-function mutation in Granule bound starch synthase I (Wx). INDEL markers revealed a high frequency of recombinant genotypes between indica and japonica. Principal component analysis using SSR genotypes of Wx flanking region revealed that glutinous indica landraces were scattered between non-glutinous indica and glutinous-japonica types. High ratios of heterozygosity were found especially in glutinous indica. Haplotype analysis using SNP markers around Wx locus revealed that glutinous indica landraces would have a few chromosome segments of glutinous japonica. Frequent recombinations were confirmed outside of this region in glutinous indica. This intricate genetic structure of landraces suggested that glutinous indica landraces in Laos were generated through repeated natural crossing with glutinous-japonica landraces and severe selection by local farmers.
27659335	Genomewide association analysis for awn length linked to the seed shattering gene qSH1 in rice.	2016	J Genet	Awn is one of the most important domesticated traits in rice (Oryza sativa). Understanding the genetic basis of awn length is important for grain harvest and production, because long awn length is disadvantageous for both grain harvest and milling. We investigated the awn length of 529 rice cultivars and performed a Genomewide association studies (GWAS) in the indica and japonica subpopulations, and the whole population. In total, we found 17 loci associated with awn length. Of these loci, seven were linked to previously reported quantitative trait loci, and one was linked to the awn gene An-1. Nine novel loci were repeatedly identified in different environments. One of the nine associations was identified in both the whole and japonica populations. Special interest was the detection of the most significant association SNP, sf0136352825, which was less than 95 kb from the seed shattering gene qSH1. These results may provide potentially favourable haplotypes for molecular breeding in rice.
27590335	Phosphorus uptake, partitioning and redistribution during grain filling in rice.	2016	Ann Bot	BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: In cultivated rice, phosphorus (P) in grains originates from two possible sources, namely exogenous (post-flowering root P uptake from soil) or endogenous (P remobilization from vegetative parts) sources. This study investigates P partitioning and remobilization in rice plants throughout grain filling to resolve contributions of P sources to grain P levels in rice.

METHODS: Rice plants (Oryza sativa 'IR64') were grown under P-sufficient or P-deficient conditions in the field and in hydroponics. Post-flowering uptake, partitioning and re-partitioning of P was investigated by quantifying tissue P levels over the grain filling period in the field conditions, and by employing 33P isotope as a tracer in the hydroponic study.

KEY RESULTS: Post-flowering P uptake represented 40-70 % of the aerial plant P accumulation at maturity. The panicle was the main P sink in all studies, and the amount of P potentially remobilized from vegetative tissues to the panicle during grain filling was around 20 % of the total aerial P measured at flowering. In hydroponics, less than 20 % of the P tracer taken up at 9 d after flowering (DAF) was found in the above-ground tissues at 14 DAF and half of it was partitioned to the panicle in both P treatments.

CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that P uptake from the soil during grain filling is a critical contributor to the P content in grains in irrigated rice. The P tracer study suggests that the mechanism of P loading into grains involves little direct transfer of post-flowering P uptake to the grain but rather substantial mobilization of P that was previously taken up and stored in vegetative tissues.
27649148	Molecular and Biochemical Analysis of Two Rice Flavonoid 3'-Hydroxylase to Evaluate Their Roles in Flavonoid Biosynthesis in Rice Grain.	2016	Int J Mol Sci	Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, the major flavonoids in black and red rice grains, respectively, are mainly derived from 3',4'-dihydroxylated leucocyanidin. 3'-Hydroxylation of flavonoids in rice is catalyzed by flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H: EC 1.14.13.21). We isolated cDNA clones of the two rice F3'H genes (CYP75B3 and CYP75B4) from Korean varieties of white, black, and red rice. Sequence analysis revealed allelic variants of each gene containing one or two amino acid substitutions. Heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that CYP75B3 preferred kaempferol to other substrates, and had a low preference for dihydrokaempferol. CYP75B4 exhibited a higher preference for apigenin than for other substrates. CYP75B3 from black rice showed an approximately two-fold increase in catalytic efficiencies for naringenin and dihydrokaempferol compared to CYP75B3s from white and red rice. The F3'H activity of CYP75B3 was much higher than that of CYP75B4. Gene expression analysis showed that CYP75B3, CYP75B4, and most other flavonoid pathway genes were predominantly expressed in the developing seeds of black rice, but not in those of white and red rice, which is consistent with the pigmentation patterns of the seeds. The expression levels of CYP75B4 were relatively higher than those of CYP75B3 in the developing seeds, leaves, and roots of white rice.
27683092	Double overexpression of DREB and PIF transcription factors improves drought stress tolerance and cell elongation in transgenic plants.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Although a variety of transgenic plants that are tolerant to drought stress have been generated, many of these plants show growth retardation. To improve drought tolerance and plant growth, we applied a gene-stacking approach using two transcription factor genes: DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING 1A (DREB1A) and rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE 1 (OsPIL1). The overexpression of DREB1A has been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in various crops, although it also causes a severe dwarf phenotype. OsPIL1 is a rice homologue of Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and it enhances cell elongation by activating cell wall-related gene expression. We found that the OsPIL1 protein was more stable than PIF4 under light conditions in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Transactivation analyses revealed that DREB1A and OsPIL1 did not negatively affect each other's transcriptional activities. The transgenic plants overexpressing both OsPIL1 and DREB1A showed the improved drought stress tolerance similar to that of DREB1A overexpressors. Furthermore, double overexpressors showed the enhanced hypocotyl elongation and floral induction compared with the DREB1A overexpressors. Metabolome analyses indicated that compatible solutes, such as sugars and amino acids, accumulated in the double overexpressors, which was similar to the observations of the DREB1A overexpressors. Transcriptome analyses showed an increased expression of abiotic stress-inducible DREB1A downstream genes and cell elongation-related OsPIL1 downstream genes in the double overexpressors, which suggests that these two transcription factors function independently in the transgenic plants despite the trade-offs required to balance plant growth and stress tolerance. Our study provides a basis for plant genetic engineering designed to overcome growth retardation in drought-tolerant transgenic plants.
27795684	Pyramiding and evaluation of both a foreign <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> and a <i>Lysine-rich protein</i> gene in the elite <i>indica</i> rice 9311.	2016	Breed Sci	Gene pyramiding is an efficient approach for the genetic improvement of multiple agronomic traits simultaneously. In this study, we pyramided two foreign genes, cry1Ac driven by the rice Actin I promoter, and lysine-rich protein (LRP), driven by the endosperm-specific GLUTELIN1 (GT1) promoter, into the elite indica cultivar 9311. These two genes were chosen in an attempt to enhance insect-resistance and Lysine (Lys) content. In the pyramided line, the foreign gene cry1Ac was efficiently expressed in the leaves and stems, and exhibited highly efficient resistance to striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis Walker) in the laboratory and rice leaf folder (RLF, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee) in the field. Furthermore, the LRP gene was highly expressed in the endosperm and produced a remarkable increase of Lys content in the seeds of the pyramided line. The data from field trials demonstrated that most of the agronomic traits including yield were well maintained in the pyramided line compared to the parental control. These results strongly suggest that the foreign cry1Ac and LRP genes have remarkable application potential in rice, and the resultant pyramided line serves as an ideal bridge material for the improvement of insect-resistance and high Lys rice in the future.
27619227	Comparative proteomic analysis reveals alterations in development and photosynthesis-related proteins in diploid and triploid rice.	2016	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Polyploidy has pivotal influences on rice (Oryza sativa L.) morphology and physiology, and is very important for understanding rice domestication and improving agricultural traits. Diploid (DP) and triploid (TP) rice shows differences in morphological parameters, such as plant height, leaf length, leaf width and the physiological index of chlorophyll content. However, the underlying mechanisms determining these morphological differences are remain to be defined. To better understand the proteomic changes between DP and TP, tandem mass tags (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was used to detect the significant changes to protein expression between DP and TP.

RESULTS: Results indicated that both photosynthesis and metabolic pathways were highly significantly associated with proteomic alteration between DP and TP based on biological process and pathway enrichment analysis, and 13 higher abundance chloroplast proteins involving in these two pathways were identified in TP. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 5 of the 13 chloroplast proteins ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL in TP were higher abundance compared with those in DP.

CONCLUSIONS: This study integrates morphology, physiology and proteomic profiling alteration of DP and TP to address their underlying different molecular mechanisms. Our finding revealed that ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL can induce considerable expression changes in TP and may affect the development and growth of rice through photosynthesis and metabolic pathways.
27968995	A reduction of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity affects sucrose/starch ratio in leaves but does not inhibit normal plant growth in rice.	2016	Plant Sci	Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) has been shown to mediate sucrose/starch ratio in plant leaves through studies of 'starch leaf' species that mainly accumulate starch in their leaves. However, the contribution of SPS to sucrose/starch ratio in rice leaves, which mainly accumulate sucrose (i.e., 'sugar leaf'), has not been confirmed due to inconsistencies in the results of previous studies. In this study, we analyzed mutant lines with reduced SPS activity, which were generated using Tos17 insertion, RNAi, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The knockdown and knockout mutants of OsSPS1 showed a 29-46% reduction in SPS activity in the leaves, but the carbohydrate content in the leaves and plant growth were not significantly different from those of wild-type plants. In a double knockout mutant of OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 (sps1/sps11), an 84% reduction in leaf SPS activity resulted in higher starch accumulation in the leaves than in the wild-type leaves. However, the sps1/sps11 plants grew normally, which is in contrast to the inhibited growth of SPS mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, a typical starch leaf plant. These results suggest that SPS has a smaller effect on the sucrose/starch ratio in leaves and growth of rice than on starch leaf species.
27717164	No effect of Bt-transgenic rice litter on the meiobenthos community in field ditches.	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The non-target effect of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins in aquatic ecosystems is crucial to improve the present assessment of Bt-transgenic plants, particularly where crops are cultivated near aquatic ecosystems. We conducted decomposition experiments during two growing seasons to determine the effects of Bt-transgenic rice litter with and without insecticide application on the meiobenthos communities in a field ditch.

RESULTS: The community composition of meiobenthos colonised on leaf litter was not significantly different between Bt and non-Bt rice. The abundance of meiobenthos colonising leaves differed between insecticide application and control, and this insecticide effect interacted with rice type. No Bt toxin was detected in field ditch water. Leaf decomposition and nutrient content were comparable for both Bt and non-Bt rice with or without insecticide application.

CONCLUSION: Bt-transgenic rice litter had no effect on the meiobenthos community composition in field ditches, but the chronic persistence of transgenic litter in nature needs to be taken into account at large scales in aquatic ecosystems. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.
27649324	Abiotic stress and phytohormones affect enzymic activity of 1-O-(indole-3-acetyl)-β-d-glucose: myo-inositol indoleacetyl transferase from rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Plant Physiol	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conjugation is a part of mechanism regulating free auxin concentration. 1-O-(indole-3-acetyl)-β-d-glucose: myo-inositol indoleacetyl transferase (IAInos synthase) is an enzyme involved in IAA-ester conjugates biosynthesis. Biotic and abiotic stress conditions can modulate auxin conjugates formation in plants. In this study, we investigated effect of plant hormones (IAA, ABA, SA and 2,4-D) and abiotic stress (drought and salt stress: 150mM NaCl and 300mM NaCl) on expression level and catalytic activity of rice IAInos synthase. Enzymic activity assay indicated that all tested phytohormones affected activity of IAInos synthase, but only ABA had inhibiting effect, while IAA, SA and 2,4-D activated the enzyme. Drought and salt stress induced with lower NaCl concentration resulted in decreased activity of IAInos synthase, but 300mM NaCl had no effect on the enzyme. Despite observed differences in enzymic activities, no changes of expression level, tested by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, were detected. Based on our results it has been supposed that plant hormones and stress conditions affect IAInos synthase activity on posttranslational level.
27795685	Variations in <i>DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1</i> (<i>DEP1</i>) contribute to the diversity of the panicle trait in high-yielding <i>japonica</i> rice varieties in northern China.	2016	Breed Sci	Rice is one of mankind's major food staples, and the erect panicle architecture in rice is an important morphological improvement. The dense and erect panicle 1 (DEP1) locus corresponds with the formation of erect panicles and has been widely used in rice breeding. However, the genetic diversity of DEP1 remains narrow. In order to improve the genetic diversity of DEP1, we used a rice germplasm collection of 72 high yielding japonica rice varieties to analyze the contribution of DEP1 to the panicle traits. We found 45 SNPs and 26 insertions and deletions (indels) within the DNA fragment of DEP1. We further detected 7 haplotypes and found that the replacement of 637 bp by a 12 bp fragment could explain the erect panicle architecture in all 72 germplasms. An SNP (G/C) at the -1253 bp of the promoter region caused a core sequence shift (TGGGCC) of a site II transcriptional regulatory element. The association analysis showed that the SNP(G/C) largely affects the number of primary and secondary branches, and grain number per panicle. Our results provide novel insights into the function and genetic diversity of DEP1. The SNP (G/C) at the promoter region will contribute to the flexible application of DEP1 in rice breeding.
27716929	RSL class I genes positively regulate root hair development in Oryza sativa.	2017	New Phytol	Root hairs are filamentous protuberances from superficial cells of plant roots that are critical for nutrient uptake. Genes encoding ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE-SIX LIKE (RSL) class I basic helix-loop-helix proteins are expressed in future root hair cells (trichoblasts) of the Arabidopsis thaliana root where they positively regulate root hair cell development. We characterized the function of class I genes in Oryza sativa root development. We show that there are three RSL class I genes in O. sativa and that each is expressed in developing root hair cells. Reduction of RSL class I function results in the development of shorter root hairs than in wild-type. Ectopic overexpression results in the development of ectopic root hair cells. These data suggest that expression of individual RSL class I proteins is sufficient for root hair development in the cereal O. sativa (rice). Therefore RSL class I genes have been conserved since O. sativa and A. thaliana last shared a common ancestor. However, given that RSL class I genes are not sufficient for root hair development in A. thaliana, it suggests that there are differences in the mechanisms repressing RSL class I gene activity between members of the Poaceae and Brassicaceae.
27689766	The ABCs of flower development: mutational analysis of AP1/FUL-like genes in rice provides evidence for a homeotic (A)-function in grasses.	2017	Plant J	The well-known ABC model describes the combinatorial interaction of homeotic genes in specifying floral organ identities. While the B- and C-functions are highly conserved throughout flowering plants and even in gymnosperms, the A-function, which specifies the identity of perianth organs (sepals and petals in eudicots), remains controversial. One reason for this is that in most plants that have been investigated thus far, with Arabidopsis being a remarkable exception, one does not find recessive mutants in which the identity of both types of perianth organs is affected. Here we report a comprehensive mutational analysis of all four members of the AP1/FUL-like subfamily of MADS-box genes in rice (Oryza sativa). We demonstrate that OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, in addition to their function of specifying meristem identity, are also required to specify palea and lodicule identities. Because these two grass-specific organs are very likely homologous to sepals and petals of eudicots, respectively, we conclude that there is a floral homeotic (A)-function in rice as defined previously. Together with other recent findings, our data suggest that AP1/FUL-like genes were independently recruited to fulfil the (A)-function in grasses and some eudicots, even though other scenarios cannot be excluded and are discussed.
27644410	Sequence analysis of the Hsp70 family in moss and evaluation of their functions in abiotic stress responses.	2016	Sci Rep	The 70-kD heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) are highly conserved molecular chaperones that play essential roles in cellular processes including abiotic stress responses. Physcomitrella patens serves as a representative of the first terrestrial plants and can recover from serious dehydration. To assess the possible relationship between P. patens Hsp70s and dehydration tolerance, we analyzed the P. patens genome and found at least 21 genes encoding Hsp70s. Gene structure and motif composition were relatively conserved in each subfamily. The intron-exon structure of PpcpHsp70-2 was different from that of other PpcpHsp70s; this gene exhibits several forms of intron retention, indicating that introns may play important roles in regulating gene expression. We observed expansion of Hsp70s in P. patens, which may reflect adaptations related to development and dehydration tolerance, and results mainly from tandem and segmental duplications. Expression profiles of rice, Arabidopsis and P. patens Hsp70 genes revealed that more than half of the Hsp70 genes were responsive to ABA, salt and drought. The presence of overrepresented cis-elements (DOFCOREZM and GCCCORE) among stress-responsive Hsp70s suggests that they share a common regulatory pathway. Moss plants overexpressing PpcpHsp70-2 showed salt and dehydration tolerance, further supporting a role in adaptation to land. This work highlights directions for future functional analyses of Hsp70s.
27628577	QTL editing confers opposing yield performance in different rice varieties.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	Grain yield is one of the most important and complex trait for genetic improvement in crops; it is known to be controlled by a number of genes known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In the past decade, many yield-contributing QTLs have been identified in crops. However, it remains unclear whether those QTLs confer the same yield performance in different genetic backgrounds. Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated QTL editing in five widely-cultivated rice varieties and revealed that the same QTL can have diverse, even opposing, effects on grain yield in different genetic backgrounds.
27684490	Immunotoxicological Evaluation of Genetically Modified Rice Expressing Cry1Ab/Ac Protein (TT51-1) by a 6-Month Feeding Study on Cynomolgus Monkeys.	None	PLoS One	The present study was performed to evaluate the food safety of TT51-1, a new type of genetically modified rice that expresses the Cry1Ab/Ac protein (Bt toxin) and is highly resistant to most lepidopteran pests. Sixteen male and 16 female cynomolgus monkeys were randomly divided into four groups: conventional rice (non-genetically modified rice, non-GM rice), positive control, 17.5% genetically modified rice (GM rice) and 70% GM rice. Monkeys in the non-GM rice, positive control, and GM rice groups were fed on diets containing 70% non-GM rice, 17.5% GM rice or 70% GM rice, respectively, for 182 days, whereas animals in the positive group were intravenously injected with cyclophosphamide every other day for a total of four injections before the last treatment. Six months of treatment did not yield abnormal observations. Specifically, the following parameters did not significantly differ between the non-GM rice group and GM rice groups: body weight, food consumption, electrocardiogram, hematology, immuno-phenotyping of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, mitogen-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation, splenocyte proliferation, KLH-T cell-dependent antibody response, organ weights and ratios, and histological appearance (p>0.05). Animals from the GM rice group differed from animals in the non-GM rice group (p<0.05) in several parameters: specifically, their body temperatures and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were higher, whereas their levels of serum K+, Cl- and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5) were lower. Because dose- or time-dependent changes were not observed in this study and animals appeared histologically normal, the aforementioned differences were not considered to be adverse or related to the treatment with GM rice. In conclusion, a 6-month feeding study of TT51-1 did not show adverse immunotoxicological effects on cynomolgus monkeys.
27603678	Genetic Diversity and Phenotypic Variation in an Introgression Line Population Derived from an Interspecific Cross between Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa.	2016	PLoS One	The introduction of closely related species genomic fragments is an effective way to enrich genetic diversity and creates new germplasms in crops. Here, we studied the genetic diversity of an introgression line (IL) population composed of 106 ILs derived from an interspecific tetra cross between O. glaberrima and O. sativa (RAM3/Jin23B//Jin23B///YuetaiB). The proportion of O. glaberrima genome (PGG) in the ILs ranged from 0.3% to 36.7%, with an average value of 12.32% which is close to the theoretically expected proportion. A total of 250 polymorphic alleles were amplified by 21 AFLP primer combinations with an average of 12 alleles per primer. Population structure analysis revealed that the IL population can be divided into four genetically distinct subpopulations. Both principal component analysis and neighbor-joining tree analysis showed that ILs with a higher PGG displayed greater genetic diversity. Canonical discriminant analysis identified six phenotypic traits (plant height, yield per plant, filled grain percentage, panicle length, panicle number and days to flowering) as the main discriminatory traits among the ILs and between the subpopulations and showed significant phenotypic distances between subpopulations. The effects of PGG on phenotypic traits in the ILs were estimated using a linear admixed model, which showed a significant positive effect on grain yield per plant (0.286±0.117), plant height (0.418 ± 0.132), panicle length (0.663 ± 0.107), and spikelet number per panicle (0.339 ± 0.128), and a significant negative effect on filled grain percentage (-0.267 ± 0.123) and days to flowering (-0.324 ± 0.075). We found that an intermediate range (10% - 20%) of PGG was more effective for producing ILs with favorable integrated agronomic traits. Our results confirm that construction of IL population carrying O. glaberrima genomic fragments could be an effective approach to increase the genetic diversity of O. sativa genome and an appropriate level of PGG could facilitate pyramiding more favorable genes for developing more adaptive and productive rice.
27600710	Effect of Elevated CO2 Concentration, Elevated Temperature and No Nitrogen Fertilization on Methanogenic Archaeal and Methane-Oxidizing Bacterial Community Structures in Paddy Soil.	2016	Microbes Environ	Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 ([CO2]) enhance the production and emission of methane in paddy fields. In the present study, the effects of elevated [CO2], elevated temperature (ET), and no nitrogen fertilization (LN) on methanogenic archaeal and methane-oxidizing bacterial community structures in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experimental paddy field were investigated by PCR-DGGE and real-time quantitative PCR. Soil samples were collected from the upper and lower soil layers at the rice panicle initiation (PI) and mid-ripening (MR) stages. The composition of the methanogenic archaeal community in the upper and lower soil layers was not markedly affected by the elevated [CO2], ET, or LN condition. The abundance of the methanogenic archaeal community in the upper and lower soil layers was also not affected by elevated [CO2] or ET, but was significantly increased at the rice PI stage and significantly decreased by LN in the lower soil layer. In contrast, the composition of the methane-oxidizing bacterial community was affected by rice-growing stages in the upper soil layer. The abundance of methane-oxidizing bacteria was significantly decreased by elevated [CO2] and LN in both soil layers at the rice MR stage and by ET in the upper soil layer. The ratio of mcrA/pmoA genes correlated with methane emission from ambient and FACE paddy plots at the PI stage. These results indicate that the decrease observed in the abundance of methane-oxidizing bacteria was related to increased methane emission from the paddy field under the elevated [CO2], ET, and LN conditions.
27708649	Gene Overexpression Resources in Cereals for Functional Genomics and Discovery of Useful Genes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Identification and elucidation of functions of plant genes is valuable for both basic and applied research. In addition to natural variation in model plants, numerous loss-of-function resources have been produced by mutagenesis with chemicals, irradiation, or insertions of transposable elements or T-DNA. However, we may be unable to observe loss-of-function phenotypes for genes with functionally redundant homologs and for those essential for growth and development. To offset such disadvantages, gain-of-function transgenic resources have been exploited. Activation-tagged lines have been generated using obligatory overexpression of endogenous genes by random insertion of an enhancer. Recent progress in DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics has enabled the preparation of genomewide collections of full-length cDNAs (fl-cDNAs) in some model species. Using the fl-cDNA clones, a novel gain-of-function strategy, Fl-cDNA OvereXpressor gene (FOX)-hunting system, has been developed. A mutant phenotype in a FOX line can be directly attributed to the overexpressed fl-cDNA. Investigating a large population of FOX lines could reveal important genes conferring favorable phenotypes for crop breeding. Alternatively, a unique loss-of-function approach Chimeric REpressor gene Silencing Technology (CRES-T) has been developed. In CRES-T, overexpression of a chimeric repressor, composed of the coding sequence of a transcription factor (TF) and short peptide designated as the repression domain, could interfere with the action of endogenous TF in plants. Although plant TFs usually consist of gene families, CRES-T is effective, in principle, even for the TFs with functional redundancy. In this review, we focus on the current status of the gene-overexpression strategies and resources for identifying and elucidating novel functions of cereal genes. We discuss the potential of these research tools for identifying useful genes and phenotypes for application in crop breeding.
27641772	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	2016	Curr Biol	Hemibiotrophic pathogens are some of the most destructive plant pathogens, causing huge economic losses and threatening global food security. Infection with these organisms often involves an initial biotrophic infection phase, during which the pathogen spreads in host tissue asymptomatically, followed by a necrotrophic phase, during which host-cell death is induced. How hemibiotrophic pathogens trigger host necrosis and how plants inhibit the transition from the biotrophic stage to the necrotrophic stage in disease symptom expression are mainly unknown. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae spreads in rice biotrophically early during infection, but this biotrophic stage is followed by a pronounced switch to cell death and lesion formation. Here, we show that the M. oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage. Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t. Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage. At the same time, APIP5 is essential for Piz-t stability. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the suppression of effector-triggered necrosis at the necrotrophic stage by an NLR receptor in plants.
27585744	A Nucleus-Encoded Chloroplast Protein YL1 Is Involved in Chloroplast Development and Efficient Biogenesis of Chloroplast ATP Synthase in Rice.	2016	Sci Rep	Chloroplast ATP synthase (cpATPase) is an importance thylakoid membrane-associated photosynthetic complex involved in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In this study, we isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant yellow leaf 1 (yl1), which exhibits chlorotic leaves throughout developmental stages. The YL1 mutation showed reduced chlorophyll contents, abnormal chloroplast morphology, and decreased photochemical efficiency. Moreover, YL1 deficiency disrupts the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that YL1 is a nucleus-encoded protein with a predicted transmembrane domain in its carboxyl-terminus that is conserved in the higher plant kingdom. YL1 localizes to chloroplasts and is preferentially expressed in green tissues containing chloroplasts. Immunoblot analyses showed that inactivation of YL1 leads to drastically reduced accumulation of AtpA (α) and AtpB (β), two core subunits of CF1αβ subcomplex of cpATPase, meanwhile, a severe decrease (ca. 41.7%) in cpATPase activity was observed in the yl1-1 mutant compared with the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed a specific interaction between YL1 and AtpB subunit of cpATPase. Taken together, our results suggest that YL1 is a plant lineage-specific auxiliary factor involved in the biogenesis of the cpATPase complex, possibly via interacting with the β-subunit.
27639667	Novosphingobium pokkalii sp nov, a novel rhizosphere-associated bacterium with plant beneficial properties isolated from saline-tolerant pokkali rice.	None	Res Microbiol	Pokkali rice varieties are known for their saline tolerance when specifically grown in coastal saline affected agri-fields of southern Kerala. These fields are prone to seawater intrusion. During characterization of phytobeneficial rhizobacteria from this pokkali rice, L3E4T was isolated. This strain showed some plant growth-promoting functions (production of indole acetic acid (IAA), acetoin, and siderophore), biofilm formation and capacity to use a wide range of plant-derived organic compounds. In planta assay under axenic conditions showed a positive effect of L3E4T on pokkali rice growth; importantly, it was able to attach and colonize pokkali rice roots in the presence of natural seawater, a key adaptation required for survival in pokkali rice fields. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA, recA, and gyrB gene sequences showed that strain L3E4T belongs to the genus Novosphingobium, with Novosphingobium capsulatum GIFU 11526T and Novosphingobium rhizosphaerae JM.1T being the nearest phylogenetic relatives. In addition, DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and phenotypic traits established that this strain belongs to a novel Novosphingobium species, for which we propose the name Novosphingobium pokkalii sp. nov. The type strain is represented by strain L3E4T (=MTCC 12357T = KCTC 42224T).
27614049	Targeted mutagenesis of a conserved anther-expressed P450 gene confers male sterility in monocots.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Targeted mutagenesis using programmable DNA endonucleases has broad applications for studying gene function in planta and developing approaches to improve crop yields. Recently, a genetic method that eliminates the need to emasculate the female inbred during hybrid seed production, referred to as Seed Production Technology, has been described. The foundation of this genetic system relied on classical methods to identify genes critical to anther and pollen development. One of these genes is a P450 gene which is expressed in the tapetum of anthers. Homozygous recessive mutants in this gene render maize and rice plants male sterile. While this P450 in maize corresponds to the male fertility gene Ms26, male fertility mutants have not been isolated in other monocots such as sorghum and wheat. In this report, a custom designed homing endonuclease, Ems26+, was used to generate in planta mutations in the rice, sorghum and wheat orthologs of maize Ms26. Similar to maize, homozygous mutations in this P450 gene in rice and sorghum prevent pollen formation resulting in male sterile plants and fertility was restored in sorghum using a transformed copy of maize Ms26. In contrast, allohexaploid wheat plants that carry similar homozygous nuclear mutations in only one, but not all three, of their single genomes were male fertile. Targeted mutagenesis and subsequent characterization of male fertility genes in sorghum and wheat is an important step for capturing heterosis and improving crop yields through hybrid seed.
27716056	Histone modifications facilitate the coexpression of bidirectional promoters in rice.	2016	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Bidirectional gene pairs are highly abundant and mostly co-regulated in eukaryotic genomes. The structural features of bidirectional promoters (BDPs) have been well studied in yeast, humans and plants. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the coexpression of BDPs remain understudied, especially in plants.

RESULTS: Here, we characterized chromatin features associated with rice BDPs. Several unique chromatin features were present in rice BDPs but were missing from unidirectional promoters (UDPs), including overrepresented active histone marks, canonical nucleosomes and underrepresented H3K27me3. In particular, overrepresented active marks (H3K4ac, H4K12ac, H4K16ac, H3K4me2 and H3K36me3) were truly overrepresented in type I BDPs but not in the other two BDPs, based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that active marks (H3K4ac, H4K12ac, H4K16ac, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac) may coordinate with repressive marks (H3K27me3 and H3K9me1/3) to build a unique chromatin structure that favors the coregulation of bidirectional gene pairs. Thus, our findings help to enhance the understanding of unique epigenetic mechanisms that regulate bidirectional gene pairs and may improve the manipulation of gene pairs for crop bioengineering.
27746797	Elucidation of Complex Nature of PEG Induced Drought-Stress Response in Rice Root Using Comparative Proteomics Approach.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Along with many adaptive strategies, dynamic changes in protein abundance seem to be the common strategy to cope up with abiotic stresses which can be best explored through proteomics. Understanding of drought response is the key to decipher regulatory mechanism of better adaptation. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) proteome represents a phenomenal source of proteins that govern traits of agronomic importance, such as drought tolerance. In this study, a comparison of root cytoplasmic proteome was done for a drought tolerant rice (Heena) cultivar in PEG induced drought conditions. A total of 510 protein spots were observed by PDQuest analysis and 125 differentially regulated spots were subjected for MALDI-TOF MS-MS analysis out of which 102 protein spots identified which further led to identification of 78 proteins with a significant score. These 78 differentially expressed proteins appeared to be involved in different biological pathways. The largest percentage of identified proteins was involved in bioenergy and metabolism (29%) and mainly consists of malate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA, putative acetyl-CoA synthetase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase etc. This was followed by proteins related to cell defense and rescue (22%) such as monodehydroascorbate reductase and stress-induced protein sti1, then by protein biogenesis and storage class (21%) e.g. putative thiamine biosynthesis protein, putative beta-alanine synthase, and cysteine synthase. Further, cell signaling (9%) proteins like actin and prolyl endopeptidase, and proteins with miscellaneous function (19%) like Sgt1 and some hypothetical proteins were also represented a large contribution toward drought regulatory mechanism in rice. We propose that protein biogenesis, cell defense, and superior homeostasis may render better drought-adaptation. These findings might expedite the functional determination of the drought-responsive proteins and their prioritization as potential molecular targets for perfect adaptation.
27695876	Genetic control of flowering time in rice: integration of Mendelian genetics and genomics.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Integration of previous Mendelian genetic analyses and recent molecular genomics approaches, such as linkage mapping and QTL cloning, dramatically strengthened our current understanding of genetic control of rice flowering time. Flowering time is one of the most important agronomic traits for seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). It is controlled mainly by genes associated with photoperiod sensitivity, particularly in short-day plants such as rice. Since the early twentieth century, rice breeders and researchers have been interested in elucidating the genetic basis of flowering time because its modification is important for regional adaptation and yield optimization. Although flowering time is a complex trait controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), classical genetic studies have shown that many associated genes are inherited in accordance with Mendelian laws. Decoding the rice genome sequence opened a new era in understanding the genetic control of flowering time on the basis of genome-wide mapping and gene cloning. Heading date 1 (Hd1) was the first flowering time QTL to be isolated using natural variation in rice. Recent accumulation of information on rice genome has facilitated the cloning of other QTLs, including those with minor effects on flowering time. This information has allowed us to rediscover some of the flowering genes that were identified by classical Mendelian genetics. The genes characterized so far, including Hd1, have been assigned to specific photoperiod pathways. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that led to an in-depth understanding of the genetic control of flowering time in rice, and of the current state of improving and fine-tuning this trait for rice breeding.
27598392	Nuclear and Chloroplast DNA Variation Provides Insights into Population Structure and Multiple Origin of Native Aromatic Rices of Odisha, India.	2016	PLoS One	A large number of short grain aromatic rice suited to the agro-climatic conditions and local preferences are grown in niche areas of different parts of India and their diversity is evolved over centuries as a result of selection by traditional farmers. Systematic characterization of these specialty rices has not been attempted. An effort was made to characterize 126 aromatic short grain rice landraces, collected from 19 different districts in the State of Odisha, from eastern India. High level of variation for grain quality and agronomic traits among these aromatic rices was observed and genotypes having desirable phenotypic traits like erect flag leaf, thick culm, compact and dense panicles, short plant stature, early duration, superior yield and grain quality traits were identified. A total of 24 SSR markers corresponding to the hyper variable regions of rice chromosomes were used to understand the genetic diversity and to establish the genetic relationship among the aromatic short grain rice landraces at nuclear genome level. SSR analysis of 126 genotypes from Odisha and 10 genotypes from other states revealed 110 alleles with an average of 4.583 and the Nei's genetic diversity value (He) was in the range of 0.034-0.880 revealing two sub-populations SP 1 (membership percentage-27.1%) and SP 2 (72.9%). At the organelle genomic level for the C/A repeats in PS1D sequence of chloroplasts, eight different plastid sub types and 33 haplotypes were detected. The japonica (Nipponbare) subtype (6C7A) was detected in 100 genotypes followed by O. rufipogon (KF428978) subtype (6C6A) in 13 genotypes while indica (93-11) sub type (8C8A) was seen in 14 genotypes. The tree constructed based on haplotypes suggests that short grain aromatic landraces might have independent origin of these plastid subtypes. Notably a wide range of diversity was observed among these landraces cultivated in different parts confined to the State of Odisha.
27876244	Overexpression of OsSPL9 enhances accumulation of Cu in rice grain and improves its digestibility and metabolism.	2016	J Genet Genomics	
27795680	Development and molecular characterization of a doubled haploid population derived from a hybrid between <i>japonica</i> rice and wide compatible <i>indica</i> rice.	2016	Breed Sci	Doubled haploid (DH) populations, particularly those from subspecies crosses possessing the wide compatible gene S5n , are important germplasm resources for rice genetic studies and breeding, but their feature and potential have not been fully assessed and explored. In the present study, we produced a DH population from the hybrid of japonica 668B and wide compatible indica T23. Genotyping of the S5 locus with allele-specific markers for ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 revealed a potential recombination hot spot in the ORF3-ORF4 region. Haplotyping analysis revealed that 21/34 subspecies specific Indel markers segregated in distortion in the DH population, with a few lines having indica alleles either extremely low (1.7%) or high (98.3%), with little effect of the S5 allele. While DH lines with the S5n allele had higher frequency of indica alleles, no effect of the S5n allele was observed on all agronomic traits but flowering time. Taken together, the present study advanced understanding of the genetics of wide crosses in general, and DH production in particular between the two rice subspecies, and the new DH population generated will become a useful resource for rice genetic study and breeding in the future.
27688090	Metabolomic study of two rice lines infected by Rhizoctonia solani in negative ion mode by CE/TOF-MS.	2016	J Plant Physiol	Rhizoctonia solani is a fungal pathogen that causes sheath blight disease in rice plants. In this study, metabolomic analysis using CE/TOF-MS in negative ion mode was used to investigate the resistance response of resistant and susceptible rice lines (32R and 29S, respectively) due to R. solani infection. Two rice lines showed different responses to the infection of R. solani. In 32R, R. solani infection induced significant increases in adenosine diphosphate (ADP), glyceric acid, mucic acid and jasmonic acid. In 29S, inosine monophosphate (IMP) was involved in the plant response to R. solani infection. Phenol compounds showed an increase as a response of the rice lines to R. solani infection. The study suggests that R. solani infection effects in 32R are associated with the induction of plant metabolic processes such as respiration, photorespiration, pectin synthesis, and lignin accumulation. In 29S, the R. solani infection is suggested to correlate with nitrogen metabolism.
27624829	CLAVATA-WUSCHEL signaling in the shoot meristem.	2016	Development	Shoot meristems are maintained by pluripotent stem cells that are controlled by CLAVATA-WUSCHEL feedback signaling. This pathway, which coordinates stem cell proliferation with differentiation, was first identified in Arabidopsis, but appears to be conserved in diverse higher plant species. In this Review, we highlight the commonalities and differences between CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathways in different species, with an emphasis on Arabidopsis, maize, rice and tomato. We focus on stem cell control in shoot meristems, but also briefly discuss the role of these signaling components in root meristems.
27677080	The growth and uptake of Ga and In of rice (Oryza sative L.) seedlings as affected by Ga and In concentrations in hydroponic cultures.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Limited information is available on the effects of gallium (Ga) and indium (In) on the growth of paddy rice. The Ga and In are emerging contaminants and widely used in high-tech industries nowadays. Understanding the toxicity and accumulation of Ga and In by rice plants is important for reducing the effect on rice production and exposure risk to human by rice consumption. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of Ga and In on the growth of rice seedlings and examines the accumulation and distribution of those elements in plant tissues. Hydroponic cultures were conducted in phytotron glasshouse with controlled temperature and relative humidity conditions, and the rice seedlings were treated with different levels of Ga and In in the nutrient solutions. The growth index and the concentrations of Ga and In in roots and shoots of rice seedlings were measured after harvesting. A significant increase in growth index with increasing Ga concentrations in culture solutions (<10mgGaL-1) was observed. In addition, the uptake of N, K, Mg, Ca, Mn by rice plants was also enhanced by Ga. However, the growth inhibition were observed while the In concentrations higher than 0.08mgL-1, and the nutrients accumulated in rice plants were also significant decreased after In treatments. Based on the dose-response curve, we observed that the EC10 (effective concentration resulting in 10% growth inhibition) value for In treatment was 0.17mgL-1. The results of plant analysis indicated that the roots were the dominant sink of Ga and In in rice seedlings, and it was also found that the capability of translocation of Ga from roots to shoots were higher than In. In addition, it was also found that the PT10 (threshold concentration of phytotoxicity resulting in 10% growth retardation) values based on shoot height and total biomass for In were 15.4 and 10.6μgplant-1, respectively. The beneficial effects on the plant growth of rice seedlings were found by the addition of Ga in culture solutions. In contrast, the In treatments led to growth inhibition of rice seedlings. There were differences in the phytotoxicity, uptake, and translocation of the two emerging contaminants in rice seedlings.
27649618	Predicting rice hybrid performance using univariate and multivariate GBLUP models based on North Carolina mating design II.	2017	Heredity (Edinb)	Genomic selection (GS) is more efficient than traditional phenotype-based methods in hybrid breeding. The present study investigated the predictive ability of genomic best linear unbiased prediction models for rice hybrids based on the North Carolina mating design II, in which a total of 115 inbred rice lines were crossed with 5 male sterile lines. Using 8 traits of the 575 (115 × 5) hybrids from two environments, both univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) prediction analyses, including additive and dominance effects, were performed. Using UV models, the prediction results of cross-validation indicated that including dominance effects could improve the predictive ability for some traits in rice hybrids. Additionally, we could take advantage of GS even for a low-heritability trait, such as grain yield per plant (GY), because a modest increase in the number of top selection could generate a higher, more stable mean phenotypic value for rice hybrids. Thus this strategy was used to select superior potential crosses between the 115 inbred lines and those between the 5 male sterile lines and other genotyped varieties. In our MV research, an MV model (MV-ADV) was developed utilizing a MV relationship matrix constructed with auxiliary variates. Based on joint analysis with multi-trait (MT) or with multi-environment, the prediction results confirmed the superiority of MV-ADV over an UV model, particularly in the MT scenario for a low-heritability target trait (such as GY), with highly correlated auxiliary traits. For a high-heritability trait (such as thousand-grain weight), MT prediction is unnecessary, and UV prediction is sufficient.
27729916	Genotypic Variation in Grain P Loading across Diverse Rice Growing Environments and Implications for Field P Balances.	2016	Front Plant Sci	More than 60% of phosphorus (P) taken up by rice (Oryza spp.) is accumulated in the grains at harvest and hence exported from fields, leading to a continuous removal of P. If P removed from fields is not replaced by P inputs then soil P stocks decline, with consequences for subsequent crops. Breeding rice genotypes with a low concentration of P in the grains could be a strategy to reduce maintenance fertilizer needs and slow soil P depletion in low input systems. This study aimed to assess variation in grain P concentrations among rice genotypes across diverse environments and evaluate the implications for field P balances at various grain yield levels. Multi-location screening experiments were conducted at different sites across Africa and Asia and yield components and grain P concentrations were determined at harvest. Genotypic variation in grain P concentration was evaluated while considering differences in P supply and grain yield using cluster analysis to group environments and boundary line analysis to determine minimum grain P concentrations at various yield levels. Average grain P concentrations across genotypes varied almost 3-fold among environments, from 1.4 to 3.9 mg g-1. Minimum grain P concentrations associated with grain yields of 150, 300, and 500 g m-2 varied between 1.2 and 1.7, 1.3 and 1.8, and 1.7 and 2.2 mg g-1 among genotypes respectively. Two genotypes, Santhi Sufaid and DJ123, were identified as potential donors for breeding for low grain P concentration. Improvements in P balances that could be achieved by exploiting this genotypic variation are in the range of less than 0.10 g P m-2 (1 kg P ha-1) in low yielding systems, and 0.15-0.50 g P m-2 (1.5-5.0 kg P ha-1) in higher yielding systems. Improved crop management and alternative breeding approaches may be required to achieve larger reductions in grain P concentrations in rice.
18759033	The defense-responsive genes showing enhanced and repressed expression after pathogen infection in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2002	Sci China C Life Sci	Despite large numbers of studies about defense response, processes involved in the resistance of plants to incompatible pathogens are still largely uncharacterized. The objective of this study was to identify genes involved in defense response by cDNA array analysis and to gain knowledge about the functions of the genes involved in defense response. Approximately 20000 rice cDNA clones were arrayed on nylon filters. RNA samples isolated from different rice lines after infection with incompatible strains or isolates of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Pyricularia grisea, respectively, were used to synthesize cDNA as probes for screening the cDNA arrays. A total of 100 differentially expressed unique sequences were identified from 5 pathogen-host combinations. Fifty-three sequences were detected as showing enhanced expression and 47 sequences were detected as showing repressed expression after pathogen infection. Sequence analysis revealed that most of the 100 sequences had various degrees of homology with genes in databases which encode or putatively encode transcription regulating proteins, translation regulating proteins, transport proteins, kinases, metabolic enzymes, and proteins involved in other functions. Most of the genes have not been previously reported as being involved in the disease resistance response in rice. The results from cDNA arrays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and RNA gel blot analysis suggest that activation or repression of most of these genes might occur commonly in the defense response.
26190741	Evolution, functions, and mysteries of plant ARGONAUTE proteins.	2015	Curr Opin Plant Biol	ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins bind small RNAs (sRNAs) to form RNA-induced silencing complexes for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Genomes of primitive plants encode only a few AGO proteins. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes ten AGO proteins, designated AGO1 to AGO10. Most early studies focused on these ten proteins and their interacting sRNAs. AGOs in other flowering plant species have duplicated and diverged from this set, presumably corresponding to new, diverged or specific functions. Among these, the grass-specific AGO18 family has been discovered and implicated as playing important roles during plant reproduction and viral defense. This review covers our current knowledge about functions and features of AGO proteins in both eudicots and monocots and compares their similarities and differences. On the basis of these features, we propose a new nomenclature for some plant AGOs.
18612237	Fine mapping of the rice Bph1 gene, which confers resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens stal), and development of STS markers for marker-assisted selection.	2008	Mol Cells	The brown planthopper (BPH) is a major insect pest in rice, and damages these plants by sucking phloem-sap and transmitting viral diseases. Many BPH resistance genes have been identified in indica varieties and wild rice accessions, but none has yet been cloned. In the present study we report fine mapping of the region containing the Bph1 locus, which enabled us to perform marker-aided selection (MAS). We used 273 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Cheongcheongbyeo, an indica type variety harboring Bph1 from Mudgo, and Hwayeongbyeo, a BPH susceptible japonica variety. By random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis using 656 random 10-mer primers, three RAPD markers (OPH09, OPA10 and OPA15) linked to Bph1 were identified and converted to SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) markers. These markers were found to be contained in two BAC clones derived from chromosome 12: OPH09 on OSJNBa0011B18, and both OPA10 and OPA15 on OSJNBa0040E10. By sequence analysis of ten additional BAC clones evenly distributed between OSJNBa0011B18 and OSJNBa0040E10, we developed 15 STS markers. Of these, pBPH4 and pBPH14 flanked Bph1 at distances of 0.2 cM and 0.8 cM, respectively. The STS markers pBPH9, pBPH19, pBPH20, and pBPH21 co-segregated with Bph1. These markers were shown to be very useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding populations of 32 F6 RILs from a cross between Andabyeo and IR71190, and 32 F5 RILs from a cross between Andabyeo and Suwon452.
23136524	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG.	2012	Breed Sci	Grain size is an important yield component in rice, however, genes controlling the trait remain poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length. Here, we report the involvement of another atypical bHLH protein gene, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 (PGL2), in the regulation of rice grain length. Over-expression of PGL2 in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma of PGL2-overexpressing lines revealed that the long grain size is caused by an increase in cell length. PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo. It was reported that overexpression of BU1 (BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1), the closest homolog of PGL2, caused an increase in grain length. However, we detected no interaction between BU1 and APG. These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG.
15695464	Induction of class-1 non-symbiotic hemoglobin genes by nitrate, nitrite and nitric oxide in cultured rice cells.	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Non-symbiotic hemoglobins (ns-Hbs) are found in all plants, although their physiological function remains to be determined. The present study was undertaken to explore the mode of induction of ns-Hb genes by metabolites of nitrate assimilation using cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells. Two class-1 ns-Hb genes, ORYsa GLB1a and ORYsa GLB1b, were strongly induced by nitrate, nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) donors, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside. The rapid and transient accumulation of ORYsa GLB1a and ORYsa GLB1b transcripts in response to nitrate, nitrite and NO donors was similar to that of nia1, which encodes NADH-nitrate reductase (NR), although repression by glutamine and asparagines was significant only for nia1. In the mutants defective in NR mRNA expression, nitrate, nitrite and NO donors failed to induce not only nia1 but also ORYsa GLB1a and ORYsa GLB1b transcripts, indicating that the induction of ns-Hb genes is closely associated with that of the NR gene. Although the kinetics of induction by nitrate, nitrite and NO donors are similar for the two ns-Hb genes, an inhibitor study demonstrated that de novo synthesis of the protein in cytoplasm is essential for inducing ORYsa GLB1b. In contrast, ORYsa GLB1a, like nia1, can be induced in the primary response to these signals without de novo protein synthesis. The role of nitrate, nitrite and NO in the induction of ns-Hb gene expression in rice cells and the possible cellar function of ns-Hbs were discussed in relation to nitrate reduction pathways.
28211849	Improvement of multiple agronomic traits by a disease resistance gene via cell wall reinforcement.	2017	Nat Plants	The major disease resistance gene Xa4 confers race-specific durable resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Although Xa4 has been one of the most widely exploited resistance genes in rice production worldwide, its molecular nature remains unknown. Here we show that Xa4, encoding a cell wall-associated kinase, improves multiple traits of agronomic importance without compromising grain yield by strengthening the cell wall via promoting cellulose synthesis and suppressing cell wall loosening. Strengthening of the cell wall by Xa4 enhances resistance to bacterial infection, and also increases mechanical strength of the culm with slightly reduced plant height, which may improve lodging resistance of the rice plant. The simultaneous improvement of multiple agronomic traits conferred by Xa4 may account for its widespread and lasting utilization in rice breeding programmes globally.
28442795	Becoming weeds.	2017	Nat Genet	A new resequencing analysis of weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) biotypes illuminates distinct evolutionary paths and outcomes of de-domestication and ferality. This largest effort to date in weedy plant genomics gives a better understanding of weediness while also providing a promising source of alleles for rice breeding.
28369039	Signatures of adaptation in the weedy rice genome.	2017	Nat Genet	Crop domestication provided the calories that fueled the rise of civilization. For many crop species, domestication was accompanied by the evolution of weedy crop relatives, which aggressively outcompete crops and reduce harvests. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie the evolution of weedy crop relatives is critical for agricultural weed management and food security. Here we use whole-genome sequences to examine the origin and adaptation of the two major strains of weedy rice found in the United States. We find that de-domestication from cultivated ancestors has had a major role in their evolution, with relatively few genetic changes required for the emergence of weediness traits. Weed strains likely evolved both early and late in the history of rice cultivation and represent an under-recognized component of the domestication process. Genomic regions identified here that show evidence of selection can be considered candidates for future genetic and functional analyses for rice improvement.
28390989	Molecular, structural, and phylogenetic analyses of Taxus chinensis JAZs.	2017	Gene	Taxus spp. are ancient gymnosperms that produce a unique secondary metabolite, namely, taxol, an anticancer drug. JAZ proteins are key regulators of the JA signaling pathway, which control taxol biosynthesis. However, the JAZ proteins of Taxus spp. are poorly studied. In this work, nine JAZ genes from Taxus chinensis were identified using our previous transcriptome data and named as TcJAZ1-TcJAZ9. Of these nine TcJAZ proteins, eight contain Jas and TIFY domains, and the Jas domain of TcJAZ6 is incomplete. Most TcJAZs and PsJAZs are not related to AtJAZs and OsJAZs. Phylogenetic analysis divided all JAZ proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Picea sitchensis, and T. chinensis into eight subgroups; gymnosperms JAZs were classified into subgroups V-VIII, and angiosperm JAZs were categorized into subgroups I-V. Three motifs of subgroups VI-VIII were identified in gymnosperm JAZs, indicating that gymnosperm JAZ proteins exhibit a different evolutionary process from those of angiosperms. The expression patterns of nine TcJAZs showed that TcJAZ2/3/8 was a key regulator, indicating their important roles in T. chinensis. Results revealed that gymnosperm JAZs differ from angiosperm JAZs in terms of molecular structure. Three novel conserved motifs were found in TcJAZs and PsJAZs. This study provides a basis for research on JA regulatory system in Taxus spp. and for elucidating the significance of JA signaling pathway to land plants.
28407265	OsHAC4 is critical for arsenate tolerance and regulates arsenic accumulation in rice.	2017	New Phytol	Soil contamination with arsenic (As) can cause phytotoxicity and elevated As accumulation in rice grain. Here, we used a forward genetics approach to investigate the mechanism of arsenate (As(V)) tolerance and accumulation in rice. A rice mutant hypersensitive to As(V), but not to As(III), was isolated. Genomic resequencing and complementation tests were used to identify the causal gene. The function of the gene, its expression pattern and subcellular localization were characterized. OsHAC4 is the causal gene for the As(V)-hypersensitive phenotype. The gene encodes a rhodanase-like protein that shows As(V) reductase activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. OsHAC4 was highly expressed in roots and was induced by As(V). In OsHAC4pro-GUS transgenic plants, the gene was expressed exclusively in the root epidermis and exodermis. OsHAC4-eGFP was localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Mutation in OsHAC4 resulted in decreased As(V) reduction in roots, decreased As(III) efflux to the external medium and markedly increased As accumulation in rice shoots. Overexpression of OsHAC4 increased As(V) tolerance and decreased As accumulation in rice plants. OsHAC4 is an As(V) reductase that is critical for As(V) detoxification and for the control of As accumulation in rice. As(V) reduction, followed by As(III) efflux, is an important mechanism of As(V) detoxification.
28385155	OsLG3 contributing to rice grain length and yield was mined by Ho-LAMap.	2017	BMC Biol	BACKGROUND: Most agronomic traits in rice are complex and polygenic. The identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain length is an important objective of rice genetic research and breeding programs.

RESULTS: Herein, we identified 99 QTL for grain length by GWAS based on approximately 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms from 504 cultivated rice accessions (Oryza sativa L.), 13 of which were validated by four linkage populations and 92 were new loci for grain length. We scanned the Ho (observed heterozygosity per locus) index of coupled-parents of crosses mapping the same QTL, based on linkage and association mapping, and identified two new genes for grain length. We named this approach as Ho-LAMap. A simulation study of six known genes showed that Ho-LAMap could mine genes rapidly across a wide range of experimental variables using deep-sequencing data. We used Ho-LAMap to clone a new gene, OsLG3, as a positive regulator of grain length, which could improve rice yield without influencing grain quality. Sequencing of the promoter region in 283 rice accessions from a wide geographic range identified four haplotypes that seem to be associated with grain length. Further analysis showed that OsLG3 alleles in the indica and japonica evolved independently from distinct ancestors and low nucleotide diversity of OsLG3 in indica indicated artificial selection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsLG3 might have much potential value for improvement of grain length in japonica breeding.

CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that Ho-LAMap is a potential approach for gene discovery and OsLG3 is a promising gene to be utilized in genomic assisted breeding for rice cultivar improvement.
28065924	Gibberellins regulate iron deficiency-response by influencing iron transport and translocation in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa).	2017	Ann Bot	Background and aims: Gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones with diverse functions. However, there has been little information on the role of GAs in response to plant nutrient deficiency.

Methods: To evaluate the roles of GAs in regulation of Fe homeostasis, the effects of GA on Fe accumulation and Fe translocation in rice seedlings were investigated using wild-type, a rice mutant ( eui1 ) displaying enhnaced endogenous GA concentrations due to a defect in GA deactivation, and transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsEUI .

Key Results: Exposure to Fe-deficient medium significantly reduced biomass of rice plants. Both exogenous application of GA and an endogenous increase of bioactive GA enhanced Fe-deficiency response by exaggerating foliar chlorosis and reducing growth. Iron deficiency significantly suppressed production of GA 1 and GA 4 , the biologically active GAs in rice. Exogenous application of GA significantly decreased leaf Fe concentration regardless of Fe supply. Iron concentration in shoot of eui1 mutants was lower than that of WT plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions. Paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, alleviated Fe-deficiency responses, and overexpression of EUI significantly increased Fe concentration in shoots and roots. Furthermore, both exogenous application of GA and endogenous increase in GA resulting from EUI mutation inhibited Fe translocation within shoots by suppressing OsYSL2 expression, which is involved in Fe transport and translocation.

Conclusions: The novel findings provide compelling evidence to support the involvement of GA in mediation of Fe homeostasis in strategy II rice plants by negatively regulating Fe transport and translocation.
28413359	Disulfide proteomics of rice cultured cells in response to OsRacl and probenazole-related immune signaling pathway in rice.	2016	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is an early event in the immune response of plants. ROS production affects the redox-based modification of cysteine residues in redox proteins, which contribute to protein functions such as enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, oligomerization, and intracellular localization. Thus, the sensitivity of cysteine residues to changes in the cellular redox status is critical to the immune response of plants.

METHODS: We used disulfide proteomics to identify immune response-related redox proteins. Total protein was extracted from rice cultured cells expressing constitutively active or dominant-negative OsRacl, which is a key regulator of the immune response in rice, and from rice cultured cells that were treated with probenazole, which is an activator of the plant immune response, in the presence of the thiol group-specific fluorescent probe monobromobimane (mBBr), which was a tag for reduced proteins in a differential display two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The mBBr fluorescence was detected by using a charge-coupled device system, and total protein spots were detected using Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Both of the protein spots were analyzed by gel image software and identified using MS spectrometry. The possible disulfide bonds were identified using the disulfide bond prediction software. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis were performed in one of the identified proteins: Oryza sativa cold shock protein 2 (OsCSP2).

RESULTS: We identified seven proteins carrying potential redox-sensitive cysteine residues. Two proteins of them were oxidized in cultured cells expressing DN-OsRac1, which indicates that these two proteins would be inactivated through the inhibition of OsRac1 signaling pathway. One of the two oxidized proteins, OsCSP2, contains 197 amino acid residues and six cysteine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of these cysteine residues revealed that a Cys140 mutation causes mislocalization of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein in the root cells of rice. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that OsCSP2 is localized in the nucleus as a homo dimer in rice root cells.

CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study indicate that redox-sensitive cysteine modification would contribute to the immune response in rice.
28444616	Genome-wide identification of grain filling genes regulated by the OsSMF1 transcription factor in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Spatial- and temporal-specific expression patterns are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by gene promoters. Therefore, it is important to identify the binding motifs of transcription factors to better understand the networks associated with embryogenesis.

RESULTS: Here, we used a protein-binding microarray (PBM) to identify the binding motifs of OsSMF1, which is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor involved in the regulation of rice seed maturation. OsSMF1 (previously called RISBZ1 or OsbZIP58) is known to interact with GCN4 motifs (TGA(G/C)TCA) to regulate seed storage protein synthesis, and it functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis. Quadruple 9-mer-based PBM analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that OsSMF1 bound to the GCN4 (TGA(G/C)TCA), ACGT (CCACGT(C/G)), and ATGA (GGATGAC) motifs with three different affinities. We predicted 44 putative OsSMF1 target genes using data obtained from both the PBM and RiceArrayNet. Among these putative target genes, 18, 21, and 13 genes contained GCN4, ACGT, and ATGA motifs within their 1-kb promoter regions, respectively. Among them, six genes encoding major grain filling proteins and transcription factors were chosen to confirm the activation of their expression in vivo. OsSMF1 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of Os03g0168500 (GCN4 motif), patatin-like gene (GCN4 motif), α-globulin (ACGT motif), rice prolamin box-binding factor (RPBF) (ATGA motif), and ONAC024 (GCN4 and ACGT motifs) and to regulate their expression.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that OsSMF1 is one of the key transcription factors that functions in a wide range of seed developmental processes with different specific binding affinities for the three DNA-binding motifs.
28471368	The first plant acyl-CoA-binding protein structures: the close homologues OsACBP1 and OsACBP2 from rice.	2017	Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol	Acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are a family of proteins that facilitate the binding of long-chain acyl-CoA esters at a conserved acyl-CoA-binding domain. ACBPs act to form intracellular acyl-CoA pools, transport acyl-CoA esters and regulate lipid metabolism. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a family of six ACBPs has been demonstrated to function in stress and development. Six ACBPs (OsACBPs) have also been identified in Oryza sativa (rice), but they are not as well characterized as those in Arabidopsis thaliana. To understand the need in rice for the two 10 kDa ACBPs, namely OsACBP1 and OsACBP2, which share 79% sequence identity, their crystal structures were elucidated and their affinities toward acyl-CoA esters were compared using isothermal titration calorimetry. OsACBP2 was found to display a higher binding affinity for unsaturated acyl-CoA esters than OsACBP1. A difference between the two proteins is observed at helix 3 and is predicted to lead to different ligand-binding modes in terms of the shape of the binding pocket and the residues that are involved. OsACBP1 thus resembles bovine ACBP, while OsACBP2 is similar to human liver ACBP, in both structure and binding affinity. This is the first time that ACBP structures have been reported from plants, and suggests that OsACBP1 and OsACBP2 are not redundant in function despite their high sequence identity and general structural similarity.
28414264	The rice transcription factors OsICE confer enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Cold stress is one of the major constraints for crop yield. Plants have in turn evolved highly sophisticated mechanisms involving altered physiologic and biochemical processes to cope with the cold stress. Previous studies have revealed that the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, directly binds and activates the expression of C-Repeat Binding Factor/Dehydration-Responsive-Element-Binding protein (CBF/DREB1) to regulate the cold-response pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the function of AtICE1 orthologues in rice is largely unknown. Here we identified that OsICE1 and OsICE2 in rice shared highly conserved amino acid sequence with AtICE1 in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes. Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice. These results demonstrated that the 2 OsICEs are orthologues of AtICE1 and play positive regulators in activation of cold-response genes to regulate the cold tolerance.
28482332	A gibberellin-stimulated transcript, OsGASR1, controls seedling growth and α-amylase expression in rice.	2017	J Plant Physiol	From a T-DNA-tagging population in rice, we identified OsGASR1 (LOC_Os03g55290), a member of the GAST (gibberellin (GA)-Stimulated Transcript) family that is induced by salt stress and ABA treatment. This gene was highly expressed in the regions of cell proliferation and panicle development, as revealed by a GUS assay of the mutant line. In the osgasr1 mutants, the second leaf blades were much longer than those of the segregating wild type due to an increase in cell length. In addition, five α-amylase genes were up-regulated in the mutants, implying that OsGASR1 is a negative regulator of those genes. These results suggest that OsGASR1 plays important roles in seedling growth and α-amylase gene expression.
28451936	Nitrogen fertilizer application affects lodging resistance by altering secondary cell wall synthesis in japonica rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	J Plant Res	Stem mechanical strength is an important agricultural quantitative trait that is closely related to lodging resistance in rice, which is known to be reduced by fertilizer with higher levels of nitrogen. To understand the mechanism that regulates stem mechanical strength in response to nitrogen, we analysed stem morphology, anatomy, mechanical properties, cell wall components, and expression of cell wall-related genes, in two varieties of japonica rice, namely, Wuyunjing23 (lodging-resistant variety) and W3668 (lodging-susceptible variety). The results showed that higher nitrogen fertilizer increased the lodging index in both varieties due to a reduction in breaking strength and bending stress, and these changes were larger in W3668. Cellulose content decreased slightly under higher nitrogen fertilizer, whereas lignin content reduced remarkably. Histochemical staining revealed that high nitrogen application decreased lignin deposition in the secondary cell wall of the sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundle cells compared with the low nitrogen treatments, while it did not alter the pattern of cellulose deposition in these cells in both Wuyunjing23 and W3668. In addition, the expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, OsPAL, OsCoMT, Os4CL3, OsCCR, OsCAD2, OsCAD7, OsCesA4, and OsCesA7, were also down-regulated under higher nitrogen conditions at the early stage of culm growth. These results suggest that the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis are down-regulated by higher nitrogen fertilizer, which causes lignin deficiency in the secondary cell walls and the weakening of mechanical tissue structure. Subsequently, this results in these internodes with reduced mechanical strength and poor lodging resistance.
28385728	Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility.	2017	Plant Physiol	Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is derived primarily from oxidative couplings of monolignols (p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was discovered recently that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of the flavonoids, tricin (3',5'-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural comonomer with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, our tricin-deficient fnsII mutant was analyzed further with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for the deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin, which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The fnsII mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that the cell wall recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through the manipulation of the flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.
28401568	A secreted chitinase-like protein (OsCLP) supports root growth through calcium signaling in Oryza sativa.	2017	Physiol Plant	Chitinases belong to a conserved protein family and play multiple roles in defense, development and growth regulation in plants. Here, we identified a secreted chitinase-like protein, OsCLP, which functions in rice growth. A T-DNA insertion mutant of OsCLP (osclp) showed significant retardation of root and shoot growth. A comparative proteomic analysis was carried out using root tissue of wild-type and the osclp mutant to understand the OsCLP-mediated rice growth retardation. Results obtained revealed that proteins related to glycolysis (phosphoglycerate kinase), stress adaption (chaperonin) and calcium signaling (calreticulin and CDPK1) were differentially regulated in osclp roots. Fura-2 molecular probe staining, which is an intracellular calcium indicator, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis suggested that the intracellular calcium content was significantly lower in roots of osclp as compared with the wild-type. Exogenous application of Ca2+ resulted in successful recovery of both primary and lateral root growth in osclp. Moreover, overexpression of OsCLP resulted in improved growth with modified seed shape and starch structure; however, the overall yield remained unaffected. Taken together, our results highlight the involvement of OsCLP in rice growth by regulating the intracellular calcium concentrations.
28382520	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility. Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACOS) is one of the enzymes activating fatty acids for various metabolic functions in plants. Here, we show that OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis ACOS5 in rice, is crucial for rice fertility. Similar to acos5, osaocs12 mutant had no mature pollen. But unlike acos5, osaocs12 produced defective anthers lacking cutin and Ubisch bodies on the epidermal and inner surfaces, respectively, and delayed programmed cell death (PCD)-induced tapetum degradation. Those phenotypic changes were evident at stage 10, during which OsACOS12 had its maximum expression in tapetal cells and microspores. Chemical analysis revealed that the levels of anther cuticular lipid components (wax and cutin monomers) were significantly reduced in osaocs12, while the expression levels of three known lipid biosynthetic genes were unchanged. Recombinant OsACOS12 enzyme was shown to catalyze the conversion of C18:1 fatty acid to C18:1 CoA in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsACOS12 is an ancient and conserved enzyme associated with the plant's colonization to earth. Collectively, our study suggests that OsACOS12 is an ancient enzyme participating in a conserved metabolic pathway for diversified biochemical functions to secure male reproduction in plants.
28424874	Identification of OsMYC2-regulated senescence-associated genes in rice.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive transcription factor OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct regulation of some senescence-associated genes in rice. OsMYC2, a transcription factor (TF), acts as a positive regulator of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling involved in development and defense in rice. Here, we report that OsMYC2 plays an important role in leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions. Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice. Leaf senescence under the DIS conditions was negatively regulated by OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein involved in the JA signaling pathway. OsMYC2 upregulated the expression of some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and selectively bound to the G-box/G-box-like motifs in the promoters of some SAGs in vivo. These results suggest that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct- or indirect-regulation of SAGs in rice.
28421330	Regulation of CONIFERALDEHYDE 5-HYDROXYLASE expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Regulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase leads to substantial alterations in lignin structure in rice cell walls, identifying a promising genetic engineering target for improving grass biomass utilization. The aromatic composition of lignin greatly affects utilization characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and, therefore, has been one of the primary targets of cell wall engineering studies. Limited information is, however, available regarding lignin modifications in monocotyledonous grasses, despite the fact that grass lignocelluloses have a great potential for feedstocks of biofuel production and various biorefinery applications. Here, we report that manipulation of a gene encoding coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H, or ferulate 5-hydroxylase, F5H) leads to substantial alterations in syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) lignin aromatic composition in rice (Oryza sativa), a major model grass and commercially important crop. Among three CAld5H genes identified in rice, OsCAld5H1 (CYP84A5) appeared to be predominantly expressed in lignin-producing rice vegetative tissues. Down-regulation of OsCAld5H1 produced altered lignins largely enriched in G units, whereas up-regulation of OsCAld5H1 resulted in lignins enriched in S units, as revealed by a series of wet-chemical and NMR structural analyses. Our data collectively demonstrate that OsCAld5H1 expression is a major factor controlling S/G lignin composition in rice cell walls. Given that S/G lignin composition affects various biomass properties, we contemplate that manipulation of CAld5H gene expression represents a promising strategy to upgrade grass biomass for biorefinery applications.
28186255	Lack of Cytosolic Glutamine Synthetase1;2 Activity Reduces Nitrogen-Dependent Biosynthesis of Cytokinin Required for Axillary Bud Outgrowth in Rice Seedlings.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	A mutation abolishing cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 (GS1;2) activity impairs assimilation of ammonium into glutamine in both roots and basal portions of shoots, and severely decreases axillary bud outgrowth (tillering) in mutant rice seedlings. Although the gs1;2 mutant phenotype is independent of strigolactone, which inhibits tillering, it also demonstrates glutamine- or related metabolite-responsive biosynthesis of cytokinin (CK), which promotes tillering. Here, we examined the connection between GS1;2 and CK biosynthesis during tillering, focusing on basal portions of the shoots as well as apical and axillary bud meristems in the gs1;2 mutant. Despite a sufficient ammonium supply, decreases in precursor CK contents and a decrease in ammonium assimilation into glutamine were observed in basal portions of mutant shoots. Reintroducing expression of OsGS1;2 cDNA driven by its own promoter restored precursor CK contents and ammonium assimilation to wild-type levels. In basal portions of the shoots, glutamine-responsive adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase4 (OsIPT4), which is also predominant in rice roots, was the predominant isogene for IPT, which synthesizes CK. Cell-specific expression of OsIPT4 in phloem companion cells in nodal vascular anastomoses connected to the axillary bud vasculature also decreased in the gs1;2 mutant. Expression of CK-responsive type-A response regulator genes as local indicators of active CKs was also abolished in the axillary bud meristem of the mutant. These results suggest that the lack of GS1;2 activity decreased levels of glutamine or a related metabolite required for CK biosynthesis, causing a deficiency in active CK in the axillary bud meristem necessary for tillering.
28412545	DNA Topoisomerase 1 Prevents R-loop Accumulation to Modulate Auxin-Regulated Root Development in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	R-loop structures (RNA:DNA hybrids) have important functions in many biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and genome instability among diverse organisms. DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), an essential manipulator of DNA topology during RNA transcription and DNA replication processes, can prevent R-loop accumulation by removing the positive and negative DNA supercoiling that is made by RNA polymerases during transcription. TOP1 is required for plant development, but little is known about its function in preventing co-transcriptional R-loop accumulation in various biological processes in plants. Here we show that knockdown of OsTOP1 strongly affects rice development, causing defects in root architecture and gravitropism, which are the consequences of misregulation of auxin signaling and transporter genes. We found that R-loops are naturally formed at rice auxin-related gene loci, and overaccumulate when OsTOP1 is knocked down or OsTOP1 protein activity is inhibited. OsTOP1 therefore sets the accurate expression levels of auxin-related genes by preventing the overaccumulation of inherent R-loops. Our data reveal R-loops as important factors in polar auxin transport and plant root development, and highlight that OsTOP1 functions as a key to link transcriptional R-loops with plant hormone signaling, provide new insights into transcriptional regulation of hormone signaling in plants.
28430017	Two NRAMP6 Isoforms Function as Iron and Manganese Transporters and Contribute to Disease Resistance in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Metal ions are essential elements for all living organisms. However, metals can be toxic when present in excess. In plants, metal homeostasis is partly achieved through the function of metal transporters, including the diverse natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMP). Among them, the OsNramp6 gene encodes a previously uncharacterized member of the rice NRAMP family that undergoes alternative splicing to produce different NRAMP6 proteins. In this work, we determined the metal transport activity and biological role of the full-length and the shortest NRAMP6 proteins (l-NRAMP6 and s-NRAMP6, respectively). Both l-NRAMP6 and s-NRAMP6 are plasma membrane-localized proteins that function as iron and manganese transporters. The expression of l-Nramp6 and s-Nramp6 is regulated during infection with the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, albeit with different kinetics. Rice plants grown under high iron supply show stronger induction of rice defense genes and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae infection. Also, loss of function of OsNramp6 results in enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, supporting the idea that OsNramp6 negatively regulates rice immunity. Furthermore, nramp6 plants showed reduced biomass, pointing to a role of OsNramp6 in plant growth. A better understanding of OsNramp6-mediated mechanisms underlying disease resistance in rice will help in developing appropriate strategies for crop protection.
28204743	OsNucleolin1-L Expression in Arabidopsis Enhances Photosynthesis via Transcriptome Modification under Salt Stress Conditions.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	OsNUC1 encodes rice nucleolin, which has been shown to be involved in salt stress responses. Expression of the full-length OsNUC1 gene in Arabidopsis resulted in hypersensitivity to ABA during germination. Transcriptome analysis of the transgenic lines, in comparison with the wild type, revealed that the RNA abundance of >1,900 genes was significantly changed under normal growth conditions, while under salt stress conditions the RNAs of 999 genes were found to be significantly regulated. Gene enrichment analysis showed that under normal conditions OsNUC1 resulted in repression of genes involved in photosynthesis, while in salt stress conditions OsNUC1 increased expression of the genes involved in the light-harvesting complex. Correspondingly, the net rate of photosynthesis of the transgenic lines was increased under salt stress. Transgenic rice lines with overexpression of the OsNUC1-L gene were generated and tested for photosynthetic performance under salt stress conditions. The transgenic rice lines treated with salt stress at the booting stage had a higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance in flag leaves and second leaves than the wild type. Moreover, higher contents of Chl a and carotenoids were found in flag leaves of the transgenic rice. These results suggest a role for OsNUC1 in the modification of the transcriptome, especially the gene transcripts responsible for photosynthesis, leading to stabilization of photosynthesis under salt stress conditions.
28403192	A novel Meloidogyne graminicola effector, MgGPP, is secreted into host cells and undergoes glycosylation in concert with proteolysis to suppress plant defenses and promote parasitism.	2017	PLoS Pathog	Plant pathogen effectors can recruit the host post-translational machinery to mediate their post-translational modification (PTM) and regulate their activity to facilitate parasitism, but few studies have focused on this phenomenon in the field of plant-parasitic nematodes. In this study, we show that the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne graminicola has evolved a novel effector, MgGPP, that is exclusively expressed within the nematode subventral esophageal gland cells and up-regulated in the early parasitic stage of M. graminicola. The effector MgGPP plays a role in nematode parasitism. Transgenic rice lines expressing MgGPP become significantly more susceptible to M. graminicola infection than wild-type control plants, and conversely, in planta, the silencing of MgGPP through RNAi technology substantially increases the resistance of rice to M. graminicola. Significantly, we show that MgGPP is secreted into host plants and targeted to the ER, where the N-glycosylation and C-terminal proteolysis of MgGPP occur. C-terminal proteolysis promotes MgGPP to leave the ER, after which it is transported to the nucleus. In addition, N-glycosylation of MgGPP is required for suppressing the host response. The research data provide an intriguing example of in planta glycosylation in concert with proteolysis of a pathogen effector, which depict a novel mechanism by which parasitic nematodes could subjugate plant immunity and promote parasitism and may present a promising target for developing new strategies against nematode infections.
28304228	Induction of Xa10-like Genes in Rice Cultivar Nipponbare Confers Disease Resistance to Rice Bacterial Blight.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is one of the most destructive bacterial diseases throughout the major rice-growing regions in the world. The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa10 confers race-specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the corresponding transcription activator-like (TAL) effector AvrXa10. Upon bacterial infection, AvrXa10 binds specifically to the effector binding element in the promoter of the R gene and activates its expression. Xa10 encodes an executor R protein that triggers hypersensitive response and activates disease resistance. 'Nipponbare' rice carries two Xa10-like genes in its genome, of which one is the susceptible allele of the Xa23 gene, a Xa10-like TAL effector-dependent executor R gene isolated recently from 'CBB23' rice. However, the function of the two Xa10-like genes in disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains has not been investigated. Here, we designated the two Xa10-like genes as Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni and characterized their function for disease resistance to rice bacterial blight. Both Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni provided disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver the matching artificially designed TAL effectors (dTALE). Transgenic rice plants containing Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni under the Xa10 promoter provided specific disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains that deliver AvrXa10. Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni knock-out mutants abolished dTALE-dependent disease resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Heterologous expression of Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nicotiana benthamiana triggered cell death. The 19-amino-acid residues at the N-terminal regions of XA10 or XA10-Ni are dispensable for their function in inducing cell death in N. benthamiana and the C-terminal regions of XA10, XA10-Ni, and XA23-Ni are interchangeable among each other without affecting their function. Like XA10, both XA10-Ni and XA23-Ni locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, show self-interaction, and induce ER Ca2+ depletion in leaf cells of N. benthamiana. The results indicate that Xa10-Ni and Xa23-Ni in Nipponbare encode functional executor R proteins, which induce cell death in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and have the potential of being engineered to provide broad-spectrum disease resistance to plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas spp.
28429296	Diurnal Changes in Transcript and Metabolite Levels during the Iron Deficiency Response of Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is highly susceptible to iron (Fe) deficiency due to low secretion levels of the mugineic acid (MA) family phytosiderophore (PS) 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) into the rhizosphere. The low levels of DMA secreted by rice have proved challenging to measure and, therefore, the pattern of DMA secretion under Fe deficiency has been less extensively studied relative to other graminaceous monocot species that secrete high levels of PS, such as barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).

RESULTS: Gene expression and metabolite analyses were used to characterise diurnal changes occurring during the Fe deficiency response of rice. Iron deficiency inducible genes involved in root DMA biosynthesis and secretion followed a diurnal pattern with peak induction occurring 3-5 h after the onset of light; a result consistent with that of other Strategy II plant species such as barley and wheat. Furthermore, triple quadrupole mass spectrometry identified 3-5 h after the onset of light as peak time of DMA secretion from Fe-deficient rice roots. Metabolite profiling identified accumulation of amines associated with metal chelation, metal translocation and plant oxidative stress responses occurring with peak induction 10-12 h after the onset of light.

CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirmed that rice shares a similar peak time of Fe deficiency associated induction of DMA secretion compared to other Strategy II plant species but has less prominent daily fluctuations of DMA secretion. It also revealed metabolic changes associated with the remediation of Fe deficiency and mitigation of damage from resulting stress in rice roots. This study complements previous studies on the genetic changes in response to Fe deficiency in rice and constitutes an important advance towards our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the rice Fe deficiency response.
28446247	Difference in oxidative stress tolerance between rice cultivars estimated with chlorophyll fluorescence analysis.	2017	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is considered to be involved in growth retardation of plants when they are exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite its potential importance in improving crop production, comparative studies on oxidative stress tolerance between rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars are limited. This work describes the difference in term of oxidative stress tolerance between 72 rice cultivars.

METHODS: 72 rice cultivars grown under naturally lit greenhouse were used in this study. Excised leaf discs were subjected to a low concentration of methyl viologen (paraquat), a chemical reagent known to generate reactive oxygen species in chloroplast. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis using a two-dimensional fluorescence meter, ion leakage analysis as well as the measurement of chlorophyll contents were used to evaluate the oxidative stress tolerance of leaf discs. Furthermore, fluorescence intensities were finely analyzed based on new fluorescence theories that we have optimized.

RESULTS: Treatment of leaf discs with methyl viologen caused differential decrease of maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) between cultivars. Decrease of Fv/Fm was also closely correlated with increase of ion leakage and decrease of chlorophyll a/b ratio. Fv/Fm was factorized into photochemical and non-photochemical parameters to classify rice cultivars into sensitive and tolerant ones. Among the 72 compared rice cultivars, the traditional cultivar Co13 was identified as the most tolerant to oxidative stress. Koshihikari, a dominant modern Japonica cultivar in Japan as well as IR58, one of the modern Indica breeding lines exhibited a strong tolerance to oxidative stress.

CONCLUSIONS: Close correlation between Fv/Fm and chlorophyll a/b ratio provides a simple method to estimate oxidative stress tolerance, without measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence with special equipment. The fact that modern cultivars, especially major cultivars possessed tolerance to oxidative stress suggests that oxidative stress tolerance is one of the agricultural traits prerequisite for improvement of modern rice cultivars. Data presented in this study would enable breeding of rice cultivars having strong tolerance to oxidative stress.
28397859	An optimized transit peptide for effective targeting of diverse foreign proteins into chloroplasts in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Various chloroplast transit peptides (CTP) have been used to successfully target some foreign proteins into chloroplasts, but for other proteins these same CTPs have reduced localization efficiencies or fail completely. The underlying cause of the failures remains an open question, and more effective CTPs are needed. In this study, we initially observed that two E.coli enzymes, EcTSR and EcGCL, failed to be targeted into rice chloroplasts by the commonly-used rice rbcS transit peptide (rCTP) and were subsequently degraded. Further analyses revealed that the N-terminal unfolded region of cargo proteins is critical for their localization capability, and that a length of about 20 amino acids is required to attain the maximum localization efficiency. We considered that the unfolded region may alleviate the steric hindrance produced by the cargo protein, by functioning as a spacer to which cytosolic translocators can bind. Based on this inference, an optimized CTP, named RC2, was constructed. Analyses showed that RC2 can more effectively target diverse proteins, including EcTSR and EcGCL, into rice chloroplasts. Collectively, our results provide further insight into the mechanism of CTP-mediated chloroplastic localization, and more importantly, RC2 can be widely applied in future chloroplastic metabolic engineering, particularly for crop plants.
28448202	Current progress in orchid flowering/flower development research.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Genetic pathways relevant to flowering of Arabidopsis are under the control of environmental cues such as day length and temperatures, and endogenous signals including phytohormones and developmental aging. However, genes and even regulatory pathways for flowering identified in crops show divergence from those of Arabidopsis and often do not have functional equivalents to Arabidopsis and/or existing species- or genus-specific regulators and show modified or novel pathways. Orchids are the largest, most highly evolved flowering plants, and form an extremely peculiar group of plants. Here, we briefly summarize the flowering pathways of Arabidopsis, rice and wheat and present them alongside recent discoveries/progress in orchid flowering and flower developmental processes including our transgenic Phalaenopsis orchids for LEAFY overexpression. Potential biotechnological applications in flowering/flower development of orchids with potential target genes are also discussed from an interactional and/or comparative viewpoint.
28383047	Identified of a novel cis-element regulating the alternative splicing of LcDREB2.	2017	Sci Rep	Alternative splicing (AS) is an important gene regulation mechanism in plants. Despite the widespread use of AS in plant gene expression regulation, the identification of the cis-elements involved in the AS mechanism is rarely reported in plants. To explore the regulation mechanism of the AS of LcDREB2, a DREB2 ortholog from Sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis), the genomic sequences of LcDREB2 and its homologs in Poaceae were aligned, and six mutations were introduced in the conserved sequence of LcDREB2. By analyzing the distinct transcript patterns of the LcDREB2 mutants in transgenic Oryza sativa, a novel cis-element that affected the AS of LcDREB2 was identified as Exonic Splicing Enhancer 1 (ESE1). In addition, five serine-arginine rich (SR) proteins were confirmed to interact with ESE1 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). To further explore the expression regulation mechanism of the DREB subfamily, phylogenetic analysis of DREB2 paralogous genes was performed. The results strongly supported the hypothesis that AS is conserved in Poaceae plants and that it is an evolutionary strategy for the regulation of the functional expression of genes. The findings and methods of our study will promote a substantial step forward in understanding of the plant AS regulation mechanism.
28458046	Transcriptional events defining plant immune responses.	2017	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Rapid and massive transcriptional reprogramming upon pathogen recognition is the decisive step in plant-phytopathogen interactions. Plant transcription factors (TFs) are key players in this process but they require a suite of other context-specific co-regulators to establish sensory transcription regulatory networks to bring about host immunity. Molecular, genetic and biochemical studies, particularly in the model plants Arabidopsis and rice, are continuously uncovering new components of the transcriptional machinery that can selectively impact host resistance toward a diverse range of pathogens. Moreover, detailed studies on key immune regulators, such as WRKY TFs and NPR1, are beginning to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which defense hormones influence the function of these factors. Here we provide a short update on such recent developments.
28400493	A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes.	2017	Plant Physiol	Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express Flowering Locus T (FT) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of Potato virus X (PVX)-based VIF in the short-day Nicotiana tabacum cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtFT by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous FT ortholog NtFT4; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-based VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-based VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-based VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of FT genes from heterologous species, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SFT and rice (Oryza sativa) Hd3a Thus, the PVX-based VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous FT genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.
28413161	Rapid and Recent Evolution of LTR Retrotransposons Drives Rice Genome Evolution During the Speciation of AA-Genome <i>Oryza</i> Species.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	The dynamics of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and their contribution to genome evolution during plant speciation have remained largely unanswered. Here, we perform a genome-wide comparison of all eight Oryza AA-genome species, and identify 3911 intact LTR retrotransposons classified into 790 families. The top 44 most abundant LTR retrotransposon families show patterns of rapid and distinct diversification since the species split over the last ∼4.8 MY (million years). Phylogenetic and read depth analyses of 11 representative retrotransposon families further provide a comprehensive evolutionary landscape of these changes. Compared with Ty1-copia, independent bursts of Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon expansions have occurred with the three largest showing signatures of lineage-specific evolution. The estimated insertion times of 2213 complete retrotransposons from the top 23 most abundant families reveal divergent life histories marked by speedy accumulation, decline, and extinction that differed radically between species. We hypothesize that this rapid evolution of LTR retrotransposons not only divergently shaped the architecture of rice genomes but also contributed to the process of speciation and diversification of rice.
28417193	Genome-wide analysis of VQ motif-containing proteins in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis).	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: 29 Moso bamboo VQ proteins were genome-wide identified for the first time, and bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergence. The qRT-PCR data show that PeVQ genes response to different stress treatments. Accumulating evidence suggests that VQ motif-containing proteins in rice (Oryza sativa), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and maize (Zea mays) play fundamental roles in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is known about the functions of VQ family proteins in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis). In this study, we performed a genome-wide bioinformatic analysis and expression profiling of PeVQ genes. A total of 29 VQ genes was identified and divided into seven subgroups (I-VII) based on phylogenetic analysis. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis revealed that 25 of 29 VQ genes contained no introns. Multiple sequence alignment showed that Moso bamboo VQ motif-containing proteins contained five variations of the conserved motif. The time of duplication and divergence of Moso bamboo from rice and maize was calculated using K s analysis. A heat map was generated using microarray data from 29 Moso bamboo VQ genes suggesting that these genes were expressed in different tissues or developmental stages. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and promoter analysis indicated that PeVQ genes were differentially regulated following treatment with polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid and salicylic acid. Our results provide a solid foundation for further research of the specific functions of VQ motif-containing proteins in Moso bamboo.
28393269	Overexpression of SbAP37 in rice alleviates concurrent imposition of combination stresses and modulates different sets of leaf protein profiles.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: SbAP37 transcription factor contributes to a combination of abiotic stresses when applied simultaneously in rice. It modulates a plethora of proteins that might regulate the downstream pathways to impart salt stress tolerance. APETALA type of transcription factor was isolated from Sorghum bicolor (SbAP37), overexpressed in rice using a salt inducible abscisic acid 2 (ABA2) promoter through Agrobacterium tumefaciens following in planta method. Transgenics were confirmed by PCR amplification of SbAP37, hygromycin phosphotransferase (hptII) marker and ABA2 promoter and DNA blot analysis. Plants were exposed to 150 mM NaCl coupled with high day/night 36 ± 2/25 ± 2 °C temperatures and also drought stress by withholding water for 1-week separately at the booting stage. SbAP37 expression was 2.8- to 4.7-folds higher in transgenic leaf under salt, but 1.8- to 3.3-folds higher in roots under drought stress. Native gene expression analysis showed that it is expressed more in stem than in roots and leaves under 150 mM NaCl and 6% PEG stress. In the present study, proteomic analysis of transgenics exposed to 150 mM NaCl coupled with elevated temperatures was taken up using quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The leaf proteome revealed 11 down regulated, 26 upregulated, 101 common (shared), 193 newly synthesized proteins in transgenics besides 368 proteins in untransformed plants. Some of these protein sets appeared different and unique to combined stresses. Our results suggest that the SbAP37 has the potential to improve combined stress tolerance without causing undesirable phenotypic characters when used under the influence of ABA2 promoter.
28401463	Crop specific plant growth promoting effects of ACCd enzyme and siderophore producing and cynogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas.	2017	3 Biotech	Fluorescent Pseudomonas, aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria possess many traits that make them well suited as biocontrol and growth promoting agents. Our study revealed that isolates vary in mechanisms involved in the antagonist interactions against pathogen and growth stimulatory effects on host plant. Most of the potential antagonistic fluorescent Pseudomonas identified were avid iron chelators (P233, P201, 176, P76 and, P76). Wide variation in ACCd enzyme production was observed. ACCd enzyme assay tested P141 > P247 > P126, as potential ACCd enzyme producer. Cynogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates P76 and P124 exerted strong inhibitory against S. rolfsii. However, another cynogenic fluorescent Pseudomonas P179 had no influence against R solani and S. rolfsii which remains unexplained. Noticeable crop specific plant growth stimulation exerted by different fluorescent Pseudomonas was observed on wheat (P124), chickpea (P72), lathyrus (P85, P216), greengram (P11), blackgram (P99, P233); bottlegourd (P248, P167); rice (P176, P247).
28340002	Overexpression of the Rice SUMO E3 Ligase Gene OsSIZ1 in Cotton Enhances Drought and Heat Tolerance, and Substantially Improves Fiber Yields in the Field under Reduced Irrigation and Rainfed Conditions.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	The Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase gene AtSIZ1 plays important roles in plant response to abiotic stresses as loss of function in AtSIZ1 leads to increased sensitivity to drought, heat and salt stresses. Overexpression of the AtSIZ1 rice homolog, OsSIZ1, leads to increased heat and drought tolerance in bentgrass, suggesting that the function of the E3 ligase SIZ1 is highly conserved in plants and it plays a critical role in abiotic stress responses. To test the possibility that the SUMO E3 ligase could be used to engineer drought- and heat-tolerant crops, the rice gene OsSIZ1 was overexpressed in cotton. We report here that overexpression of OsSIZ1 in cotton results in higher net photosynthesis and better growth than wild-type cotton under drought and thermal stresses in growth chamber and greenhouse conditions. Additionally, this tolerance to abiotic stresses was correlated with higher fiber yield in both controlled-environment and field trials carried out under reduced irrigation and rainfed conditions. These results suggest that OsSIZ1 is a viable candidate gene to improve crop yields under water-limited and rainfed agricultural production systems.
28417425	Overexpression of OsHSP18.0-CI Enhances Resistance to Bacterial Leaf Streak in Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The small heat shock proteins represent a large family of proteins that respond to a wide range of abiotic and biotic stresses. OsHsp18.0-CI confers tolerance to salt and cadmium and interacts with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). However, the direct function of OsHsp18.0-CI in resistance against biotic stresses remains unclear in rice.

RESULTS: Here, we report that the expression of OsHsp18.0-CI was up-regulated upon inoculation with RS105, a strain of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) that causes bacterial leaf streak in rice. In comparison with wild-type, OsHsp18.0-CI overexpression (OE) lines exhibited enhanced resistance to RS105, whereas repression lines exhibited compromised resistance to RS105. In addition, the transcriptional profiles of wild type and OE lines were compared with and without inoculation with RS105. After inoculation with RS105, most of the genes with up-regulated expression were commonly stimulated in the wild type and OE lines, with stronger induction in the OE lines than in wild type.

CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that OsHsp18.0-CI positively regulates resistance to Xoc by mediating an enhanced version of the basal defense response in rice.
28454637	Uptake and translocation of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and difenoconazole in rice plants.	2017	Environ Pollut	Uptake and translocation of imidacloprid (IMI), thiamethoxam (THX) and difenoconazole (DFZ) in rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) were investigated with a soil-treated experiment at two application rates: field rate (FR) and 10*FR under laboratory conditions. The dissipation of the three compounds in soil followed the first-order kinetics and DFZ showed greater half-lives than IMI and THX. Detection of the three compounds in rice tissues indicated that rice plants could take up and accumulate these pesticides. The concentrations of IMI and THX detected in leaves (IMI, 10.0 and 410 mg/kg dw; THX, 23.0 and 265 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in roots (IMI, 1.37 and 69.3 mg/kg dw; THX, 3.19 and 30.6 mg/kg dw), which differed from DFZ. The DFZ concentrations in roots (15.6 and 79.1 mg/kg dw) were much greater than those in leaves (0.23 and 3.4 mg/kg dw). The bioconcentration factor (BCF), representing the capability of rice to accumulate contaminants from soil into plant tissues, ranged from 1.9 to 224.3 for IMI, from 2.0 to 72.3 for THX, and from 0.4 to 3.2 for DFZ at different treated concentrations. Much higher BCFs were found for IMI and THX at 10*FR treatment than those at FR treatment, however, the BCFs of DFZ at both treatments were similar. The translocation factors (TFs), evaluating the capability of rice to translocate contaminants from the roots to the aboveground parts, ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 for stems and from 0.02 to 9.0 for leaves. The tested compounds were poorly translocated from roots to stems, with a TF below 1. However, IMI and THX were well translocated from roots to leaves. Clothianidin (CLO), the main metabolite of THX, was detected at the concentrations from 0.02 to 0.5 mg kg-1 in soil and from 0.07 to 7.0 mg kg-1 in plants. Concentrations of CLO in leaves were almost 14 times greater than those in roots at 10*FR treatment.
28425127	Manipulation of glyoxalase pathway confers tolerance to multiple stresses in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Crop plants face a multitude of diverse abiotic and biotic stresses in the farmers' fields. Although there now exists a considerable knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of response to individual stresses, the crosstalk between response pathways to various abiotic and biotic stresses remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated if the cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MG), excess of which is generated as a common consequence of many abiotic and biotic stresses, may serve as a key molecule linking responses to diverse stresses. For this, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing the entire two-step glyoxalase pathway for MG detoxification. Through assessment of various morphological, physiological and agronomic parameters, we found that glyoxalase-overexpression imparts tolerance towards abiotic stresses like salinity, drought and heat and also provides resistance towards damage caused by the sheath blight fungus (Rhizoctonia solani) toxin phenylacetic acid. We show that the mechanism of observed tolerance of the glyoxalase-overexpressing plants towards these diverse abiotic and biotic stresses involves improved MG detoxification and reduced oxidative damage leading to better protection of chloroplast and mitochondrial ultrastructure and maintained photosynthetic efficiency under stress conditions. Together, our findings indicate that MG may serve as a key link between abiotic and biotic stress response in plants.
28398878	Development and Validation of a TaqMan Real-Time PCR Assay for the Specific Detection and Quantification of Fusarium fujikuroi in Rice Plants and Seeds.	2017	Phytopathology	Bakanae disease, which is caused by the seedborne pathogen Fusarium fujikuroi, is found throughout the world on rice. A TaqMan real-time PCR has been developed on the TEF 1-α gene to detect F. fujikuroi in different rice tissues. Three primer/probe sets were tested. The selected set produced an amplicon of 84 bp and was specific for F. fujikuroi with respect to eight Fusarium species of rice and six other rice common pathogens. The assay was validated for specificity, selectivity, sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility. The detection limit was set at 27.5 fg of DNA, which is approximately equivalent to one haploid genome of F. fujikuroi. The developed TaqMan real-time assay was able to efficiently detect and quantify F. fujikuroi from rice culms, leaves, roots, and seeds. At 1 week post-germination (wpg), the pathogen was more diffused in the green tissues, while at 3 wpg it was uniformly spread also in the roots. The highest concentration of F. fujikuroi was measured in the M6 cultivar, which showed around 1,450 fungal cells/g. The assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect a few genomic equivalents in the rice seeds, corresponding to 9.89 F. fujikuroi cells/g. The assay permitted bakanae disease to be detected in asymptomatic tissues at the early rice development stages.
28445706	Fabrication of electrochemical biosensor with vanadium pentoxide nano-interface for the detection of methylglyoxal in rice.	2017	Anal Biochem	Increased consumption of raw and par-boiled rice results in the formation of methylglyoxal (MG) at higher concentration and leads to complications in diabetic patients. Highly sensitive electrochemical biosensor was developed using glutathione (GSH) as a co-factor with vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) as a nano-interface for MG detection in rice samples. The Pt/V2O5/GSH/Chitosan bioelectrode displayed two well-defined redox peaks in its cyclic voltammograms for MG reduction. This occurred as two electron transfer process where MG gained two electrons from oxidized glutathione disulfide and formed hemithioacetal. The current density response of the fabricated bioelectrode was linear towards MG in the concentration range of 0.1-100 μM with the correlation coefficient of 0.99, sensitivity of 1130.86 μA cm-2 μM-1, limit of detection of 2 nM and response time of less than 18 s. The developed bioelectrode was used for the detection of MG in raw and par-boiled rice samples.
28407080	Genome-wide changes in microRNA expression during short and prolonged heat stress and recovery in contrasting rice cultivars.	2017	J Exp Bot	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate expression of genes under stress. We report here the deep sequencing of small RNAs expressed during control, short and prolonged heat stress and recovery. Genome-wide identification of miRNAs in tolerant (Nagina 22) and susceptible (Vandana) rice cultivars was performed in 16 samples representing root and shoot of 13-day-old seedlings. The expression profile of miRNAs was analysed in 36 pairwise combinations to identify the genotype-, treatment- and tissue-dependent expression of miRNAs. Small-RNA sequencing of 16 libraries yielded ~271 million high-quality raw sequences; 162 miRNA families were identified. The highly expressed miRNAs in rice tissues were miR166, miR168, miR1425, miR529, mR162, miR1876, and miR1862. Expression of osa-miR1436, osa-miR5076, osa-miR5161, and osa-miR6253 was observed only in stressed tissue of both genotypes indicating their general role in heat stress response. Expression of osa-miR1439, osa-miR1848, osa-miR2096, osa-miR2106, osa-miR2875, osa-miR3981, osa-miR5079, osa-miR5151, osa-miR5484, osa-miR5792, and osa-miR5812 was observed only in Nagina 22 during high temperature, suggesting a specific role of these miRNAs in heat stress tolerance. This study provides details of the repertoire of miRNAs expressed in root and shoot of heat susceptible and tolerant rice genotypes under heat stress and recovery.
28420345	Selective sweep with significant positive selection serves as the driving force for the differentiation of japonica and indica rice cultivars.	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), including japonica and indica, is unarguable the most important crop in Asia as well as worldwide. However, a decisive conclusion of its origination and domestication processes are still lacking. Nowadays, the ever-increasing high-throughput sequencing data of numerous rice samples have provided us new opportunities to get close to the answer of these questions.

RESULTS: By compiling 296 whole-genome sequenced rice cultivars and 39 diverse wild rice, two types of domesticated regions (DR-I and DR-II) with strong selective sweep signals between different groups were detected. DR-I regions included 28 blocks which significantly differentiated between japonica and indica subspecies, while DR-II regions were consisted of another 28 blocks which significantly differentiated between wild and cultivated rice, each covered 890 kb and 640 kb, respectively. In-depth analysis suggested that both DR-Is and DR-IIs could have originated from Indo-China Peninsula to southern China, and DR-IIs might be introgressed from indica to japonica. Functional bias with significant positive selection has also been detected in the genes of DR-I, suggesting important role of the selective sweep in differentiation of japonica and indica.

CONCLUSIONS: This research promoted a new possible model of the origin of the cultivated rice that DR-Is in japonica and indica maybe independently originated from the divergent wild rice in the Indo-China Peninsula to southern China, and then followed by frequent introgression. Genes with significant positive selection and biased functions were also detected which could play important roles in rice domestication and differentiation processes.
28451819	Overexpression of miR529a confers enhanced resistance to oxidative stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Overexpressing miR529a can enhance oxidative stress resistance by targeting OsSPL2 and OsSPL14 genes that can regulate the expression of their downstream SOD and POD related genes. MicroRNAs are involved in the regulation of plant developmental and physiological processes, and their expression can be altered when plants suffered environment stresses, including salt, oxidative, drought and Cadmium. The expression of microRNA529 (miR529) can be induced under oxidative stress. However, its biological function under abiotic stress responses is still unclear. In this study, miR529a was overexpressed to investigate the function of miR529a under oxidative stress in rice. Our results demonstrated that the expression of miR529a can be induced by exogenous H2O2, and overexpressing miR529a can increase plant tolerance to high level of H2O2, resulting in increased seed germination rate, root tip cell viability, reduced leaf rolling rate and chlorophyll retention. The expression of oxidative stress responsive genes and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) were increased in miR529a overexpression plant, which could help to reduce redundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, only OsSPL2 and OsSPL14 were targeted by miR529a in rice seedlings, repressing their expression in miR529aOE plants could lead to strengthen plant tolerance to oxidation stress. Our study provided the evidence that overexpression of miR529a could strengthen oxidation resistance, and its target genes OsSPL2 and OsSPL14 were responsible for oxidative tolerance, implied the manipulation of miR529a and its target genes regulation on H2O2 related response genes could improve oxidative stress tolerance in rice.
28494393	Alterations in growth, oxidative damage, and metal uptake of five aromatic rice cultivars under lead toxicity.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Lead (Pb) affects plant growth and its related physio-biochemical functions negatively. The present study investigated the responses of five different fragrant rice cultivars viz., Meixiangzhan (MXZ-2), Xiangyaxiangzhan (XYXZ), Guixiangzhan (GXZ), Basmati-385 (B-385), and Nongxiang-18 (NX-18) to four different Pb concentrations viz., 0, 400, 800 and 1200 μM. Results depicted that Pb toxicity significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the plant height, tillering ability and biomass accumulation by causing oxidative damage to rice plants; nonetheless, a significant variation was found in the sensitivity of rice cultivars to Pb toxicity. Soluble sugars increased significantly only at 1200 μM in GXZ and 800 μM in B-385, whilst the maximum reductions in protein contents were observed at 1200 μM Pb for all rice cultivars. Proline contents were reduced for XYXZ and NX-18 at Pb1200 μM. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) showed differential behavior among Pb treatments and rice cultivars. Among rice cultivars, GXZ showed better antioxidative defense system under Pb toxicity compared with all other cultivars. For all rice cultivars, the trend for Pb accumulation was recorded as: roots > stems > leaves. Furthermore, significant but negative correlations among Pb uptake and plant height (r = -0.79), tillers per plant (r = -0.91) and plant dry biomass (r = -0.81) were recorded for all rice cultivars whereas the values of translocation factor (TF) from stems to leaves were higher than roots to stems. In sum, Pb reduced the early growth and caused physio-biochemical changes in all rice cultivars, nonetheless, GXZ proved better able to tolerate Pb stress than all other rice cultivars under study.
28455510	Effects of fertilization on crop production and nutrient-supplying capacity under rice-oilseed rape rotation system.	2017	Sci Rep	Incredible accomplishments have been achieved in agricultural production in China, but many demanding challenges for ensuring food security and environmental sustainability remain. Field experiments were conducted from 2011-2013 at three different sites, including Honghu, Shayang, and Jingzhou in China, to determine the effects of fertilization on enhancing crop productivity and indigenous nutrient-supplying capacity (INuS) in a rice (Oryza sativa L.)-rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) rotation. Four mineral fertilizer treatments (NPK, NP, NK and PK) were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Crop yields were increased by 19-41% (rice) and 61-76% (rapeseed) during the two years of rice-rapeseed rotation under NPK fertilization compared to PK fertilization across the study sites. Yield responses to fertilization were ranked NPK > NP > NK > PK, illustrating that N deficiency was the most limiting condition in a rice-rapeseed rotation, followed by P and K deficiencies. The highest and lowest N, P and K accumulations were observed under NPK and PK fertilization, respectively. The INuS of the soil decreased to a significant extent and affected rice-rapeseed rotation productivity at each site under NP, NK, and PK fertilization when compared to NPK. Based on the study results, a balanced nutrient application using NPK fertilization is a key management strategy for enhancing rice-rapeseed productivity and environmental safety.
28424214	Functional Conservation and Divergence among Homoeologs of <i>TaSPL20</i> and <i>TaSPL21</i>, Two SBP-Box Genes Governing Yield-Related Traits in Hexaploid Wheat.	2017	Plant Physiol	Maintaining high and stable yields has become an increasing challenge in wheat breeding due to climate change. Although Squamosa-promoter binding protein (SBP)-box genes have important roles in plant development, very little is known about the actual biological functions of wheat SBP-box family members. Here, we dissect the functional conservation, divergence, and exploitation of homoeologs of two paralogous TaSPL wheat loci during domestication and breeding. TaSPL20 and TaSPL21 were highly expressed in the lemma and palea. Ectopic expressions of TaSPL20/21 in rice exhibited similar functions in terms of promoting panicle branching but had different functions during seed development. We characterized all six TaSPL20/21 genes located across the three homoeologous (A, B, and D) genomes. According to the functional analysis of naturally occurring variants in 20 environments, four favorable haplotypes were identified. Together, they reduced plant height by up to 27.5%, and TaSPL21-6D-HapII increased 1000-grain weight by 9.73%. Our study suggests that TaSPL20 and TaSPL21 homoeologs underwent diversification in function with each evolving its own distinctive characteristics. During domestication and breeding of wheat in China, favorable haplotypes of each set were selected and exploited to varying degrees due to their large effects on plant height and 1000-grain weight.
28168930	Avirulence (AVR) Gene-Based Diagnosis Complements Existing Pathogen Surveillance Tools for Effective Deployment of Resistance (R) Genes Against Rice Blast Disease.	2017	Phytopathology	Avirulence (AVR) genes in Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen that causes the devastating rice blast disease, have been documented to be major targets subject to mutations to avoid recognition by resistance (R) genes. In this study, an AVR-gene-based diagnosis tool for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population was developed and validated. A set of 77 single-spore field isolates was subjected to pathotype analysis using differential lines, each containing a single R gene, and classified into 20 virulent pathotypes, except for 4 isolates that lost pathogenicity. In all, 10 differential lines showed low frequency (<24%) of resistance whereas 8 lines showed a high frequency (>95%), inferring the effectiveness of R genes present in the respective differential lines. In addition, the haplotypes of seven AVR genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing, if applicable. The calculated frequency of different AVR genes displayed significant variations in the population. AVRPiz-t and AVR-Pii were detected in 100 and 84.9% of the isolates, respectively. Five AVR genes such as AVR-Pik-D (20.5%) and AVR-Pik-E (1.4%), AVRPiz-t (2.7%), AVR-Pita (0%), AVR-Pia (0%), and AVR1-CO39 (0%) displayed low or even zero frequency. The frequency of AVR genes correlated almost perfectly with the resistance frequency of the cognate R genes in differential lines, except for International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines IRBLzt-T, IRBLta-K1, and IRBLkp-K60. Both genetic analysis and molecular marker validation revealed an additional R gene, most likely Pi19 or its allele, in these three differential lines. This can explain the spuriously higher resistance frequency of each target R gene based on conventional pathotyping. This study demonstrates that AVR-gene-based diagnosis provides a precise, R-gene-specific, and differential line-free assessment method that can be used for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population and for predicting the effectiveness of target R genes in rice varieties.
28438013	Characterization of Newly Bred <i>Cordyceps militaris</i> Strains for Higher Production of Cordycepin through HPLC and URP-PCR Analysis.	2017	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Cordyceps militaris, a member of Ascomycota, a mushroom referred to as caterpillar Dongchung-ha-cho, is commercially valuable because of its high content of bioactive substances, including cordycepin, and its potential for artificial cultivation. Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) is highly associated with the pharmacological effects of C. militaris. C. militaris is heterothallic in that two mating-type loci, idiomorph MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, exist discretely in two different spores. In this study, nine C. militaris strains were mated with each other to prepare newly bred strains that produced a larger amount of cordycepin than the parent strains. Nine strains of C. militaris were identified by comparing the internal transcribed spacer sequence, and a total of 12 single spores were isolated from the nine strains of C. militaris. After the MAT idiomorph was confirmed by PCR, 36 mating combinations were performed with six single spores with MAT1-1 and the others with MAT1-2. Eight mating combinations were successfully mated, producing stroma with perithecia. Cordycepin content analysis of all strains by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the KASP4-bred strain produced the maximum cordycepin among all strains, regardless of the medium and stroma parts. Finally, universal rice primer-PCR was performed to demonstrate that the bred strains were genetically different from the parental strains and new C. militaris strains. These results may be related to the recombination of genes during mating. The newly produced strains can be used to meet the industrial demand for cordycepin. In addition, breeding through mating suggests the possibility of producing numerous cordycepin-producing C. militaris strains.
28106309	Transposable elements (TEs) contribute to stress-related long intergenic noncoding RNAs in plants.	2017	Plant J	Noncoding RNAs have been extensively described in plant and animal transcriptomes by using high-throughput sequencing technology. Of these noncoding RNAs, a growing number of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been described in multicellular organisms, however the origins and functions of many lincRNAs remain to be explored. In many eukaryotic genomes, transposable elements (TEs) are widely distributed and often account for large fractions of plant and animal genomes yet the contribution of TEs to lincRNAs is largely unknown. By using strand-specific RNA-sequencing, we profiled the expression patterns of lincRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and identified 47 611 and 398 TE-associated lincRNAs (TE-lincRNAs), respectively. TE-lincRNAs were more often derived from retrotransposons than DNA transposons and as retrotransposon copy number in both rice and maize genomes so did TE-lincRNAs. We validated the expression of these TE-lincRNAs by strand-specific RT-PCR and also demonstrated tissue-specific transcription and stress-induced TE-lincRNAs either after salt, abscisic acid (ABA) or cold treatments. For Arabidopsis TE-lincRNA11195, mutants had reduced sensitivity to ABA as demonstrated by longer roots and higher shoot biomass when compared to wild-type. Finally, by altering the chromatin state in the Arabidopsis chromatin remodelling mutant ddm1, unique lincRNAs including TE-lincRNAs were generated from the preceding untranscribed regions and interestingly inherited in a wild-type background in subsequent generations. Our findings not only demonstrate that TE-associated lincRNAs play important roles in plant abiotic stress responses but lincRNAs and TE-lincRNAs might act as an adaptive reservoir in eukaryotes.
28378144	Development and Genetic Characterization of A Novel Herbicide (Imazethapyr) Tolerant Mutant in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Increased water and labour scarcity in major rice growing areas warrants a shift towards direct seeded rice cultivation under which management of weeds is a major issue. Use of broad spectrum non-selective herbicides is an efficient means to manage weeds. Availability of rice genotypes with complete tolerance against broad-spectrum non-selective herbicides is a pre-requisite for advocating use of such herbicides. In the present study, we developed an EMS induced rice mutant, 'HTM-N22', exhibiting tolerance to a broad spectrum herbicide, 'Imazethapyr', and identified the mutations imparting tolerance to the herbicide.

RESULTS: We identified a stable and true breeding rice mutant, HTM-N22 (HTM), tolerant to herbicide, Imazethapyr, from an EMS-mutagenized population of approximately 100,000 M2 plants of an upland rice variety, Nagina 22 (N22). Analysis of inheritance of herbicide tolerance in a cross between Pusa 1656-10-61/HTM showed that this trait is governed by a single dominant gene. To identify the causal gene for Imazethapyr tolerance, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was followed using microsatellite markers flanking the three putative candidate genes viz., an Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) on chromosome 6 and two Acetohydroxy Acid Synthase (AHAS) genes, one on chromosomes 2 and another on chromosome 4. RM 6844 on chromosome 2 located 0.16 Mbp upstream of AHAS (LOC_Os02g30630) was found to co-segregate with herbicide tolerance. Cloning and sequencing of AHAS (LOC_Os02g30630) from the wild type, N22 and the mutant HTM and their comparison with reference Nipponbare sequence revealed several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mutant, of which eight resulted in non-synonymous mutations. Three of the eight amino acid substitutions were identical to Nipponbare and hence were not considered as causal changes. Of the five putative candidate SNPs, four were novel (at positions 30, 50, 81 and 152) while the remaining one, S627D was a previously reported mutant, known to result in Imidazolinone tolerance in rice. Of the novel ones, G152E was found to alter the hydrophobicty and abolish an N myristoylation site in the HTM compared to the WT, from reference based modeling and motif prediction studies.

CONCLUSIONS: A novel mutant tolerant to the herbicide "Imazethapyr" was developed and characterized for genetic, sequence and protein level variations. This is a HTM in rice without any IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) infringements and hence can be used in rice breeding as a novel genetic stock by the public funded organizations in the country and elsewhere.
28397857	Reproductive stage physiological and transcriptional responses to salinity stress in reciprocal populations derived from tolerant (Horkuch) and susceptible (IR29) rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Global increase in salinity levels has made it imperative to identify novel sources of genetic variation for tolerance traits, especially in rice. The rice landrace Horkuch, endemic to the saline coastal area of Bangladesh, was used in this study as the source of tolerance in reciprocal crosses with the sensitive but high-yielding IR29 variety for discovering transcriptional variation associated with salt tolerance in the resulting populations. The cytoplasmic effect of the Horkuch background in leaves under stress showed functional enrichment for signal transduction, DNA-dependent regulation and transport activities. In roots the enrichment was for cell wall organization and macromolecule biosynthesis. In contrast, the cytoplasmic effect of IR29 showed upregulation of apoptosis and downregulation of phosphorylation across tissues relative to Horkuch. Differential gene expression in leaves of the sensitive population showed downregulation of GO processes like photosynthesis, ATP biosynthesis and ion transport. Roots of the tolerant plants conversely showed upregulation of GO terms like G-protein coupled receptor pathway, membrane potential and cation transport. Furthermore, genes involved in regulating membrane potentials were constitutively expressed only in the roots of tolerant individuals. Overall our work has developed genetic resources and elucidated the likely mechanisms associated with the tolerance response of the Horkuch genotype.
28400567	Genetic dissection of yield traits in super hybrid rice Xieyou9308 using both unconditional and conditional genome-wide association mapping.	2017	Sci Rep	With the development and application of super rice breeding, elite rice hybrids with super high-yielding potential have been widely developed in last decades in China. Xieyou9308 is one of the most famous super hybrid rice varieties. To uncover the genetic mechanism of Xieyou9308's high yield potential, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from cross of XieqingzaoB and Zhonghui9308 was re-sequenced and investigated on the grain yield (GYD) and its three component traits, number of panicles per plant (NP), number of filled grains per panicle (NFGP), and grain weight (GW). Unconditional and conditional genome-wide association analysis, based on a linear mixed model with epistasis and gene-environment interaction effects, were conducted, using ~0.7 million identified SNPs. There were six, four, seven, and seven QTSs identified for GYD, NP, NFGP, and GW, respectively, with accumulated explanatory heritability varying from 43.06% to 48.36%; additive by environment interactions were detected for GYD, some minor epistases were detected for NP and NFGP. Further, conditional genetic mapping analysis for GYD given its three components revealed several novel QTSs associated with yield than that were suppressed in our unconditional mapping analysis.
28430356	CRISPR/Cas9: An RNA-guided highly precise synthetic tool for plant genome editing.	2018	J Cell Physiol	CRISPR/Cas9 is a newly developed and naturally occurred genome editing tool, which is originally used by bacteria for immune defence. In the past years, it has been quickly employed and modified to precisely edit genome sequences in both plants and animals. Compared with the well-developed zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), CRISPR/Cas9 has lots of advantages, including easier to design and implement, higher targeting efficiency, and less expensive. Thus, it is becoming one of the most powerful tools for knockout of an individual gene as well as insertion of one gene and/or control of gene transcription. Studies have shown that CRISPR/Cas9 is a great tool to edit many genes in a variety of plant species, including the model plant species as well as agriculturally important crops, such as cotton, maize, wheat, and rice. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing can be used for plant functional studies and plant improvement to yield, quality, and tolerance to environmental stress.
28103409	Zea mays Fe deficiency-related 4 (ZmFDR4) functions as an iron transporter in the plastids of monocots.	2017	Plant J	Iron (Fe)-homeostasis in the plastids is closely associated with Fe transport proteins that prevent Fe from occurring in its toxic free ionic forms. However, the number of known protein families related to Fe transport in the plastids (about five) and the function of iron in non-green plastids is limited. In the present study, we report the functional characterization of Zea mays Fe deficiency-related 4 (ZmFDR4), which was isolated from a differentially expressed clone of a cDNA library of Fe deficiency-induced maize roots. ZmFDR4 is homologous to the bacterial FliP superfamily, coexisted in both algae and terrestrial plants, and capable of restoring the normal growth of the yeast mutant fet3fet4, which possesses defective Fe uptake systems. ZmFDR4 mRNA is ubiquitous in maize and is inducible by iron deficiency in wheat. Transient expression of the 35S:ZmFDR4-eGFP fusion protein in rice protoplasts indicated that ZmFDR4 maybe localizes to the plastids envelope and thylakoid. In 35S:c-Myc-ZmFDR4 transgenic tobacco, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting confirmed that ZmFDR4 is targeted to both the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid. Meanwhile, ultrastructure analysis indicates that ZmFDR4 promotes the density of plastids and accumulation of starch grains. Moreover, Bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS) colorimetry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicate that ZmFDR4 is related to Fe uptake by plastids and increases seed Fe content. Finally, 35S:c-Myc-ZmFDR4 transgenic tobacco show enhanced photosynthetic efficiency. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrate that ZmFDR4 functions as an iron transporter in monocot plastids and provide insight into the process of Fe uptake by plastids.
28461082	Mechanism study of sulfur fertilization mediating copper translocation and biotransformation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants.	2017	Environ Pollut	Metabolism of sulfur (S) is suggested to be an important factor for the homeostasis and detoxification of Cu in plants. We investigated the effects of S fertilizers (S0, Na2SO4) on Cu translocation and biotransformation in rice plants by using multiple synchrotron-based techniques. Fertilization of S increased the biomass and yield of rice plants, as well as the translocation factor of Cu from root to shoot and shoot to grain, resulting in enhanced Cu in grain. Sulfur K-edge X-ray near edge structure (XANES) analysis showed that fertilization of S increased the concentration of glutathione in different rice tissues, especially in rice stem and leaf. Copper K-edge XANES results indicated that a much higher proportion of Cu (I) species existed in rice grain than husk and leaf, which was further confirmed by soft X-ray scanning transmission microscopy results. Sulfur increased the proportion of Cu (I) species in rice grain, husk and leaf, suggesting the inducing of Cu (II) reduction in rice tissues by S fertilization. These results suggested that fertilization of S in paddy soils increased the accumulation of Cu in rice grain, possibly due to the reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (I) by enhancing glutathione synthesis and increasing the translocation of Cu from shoot to grain.
28422161	Impact of low-temperature, overcast and rainy weather during the reproductive growth stage on lodging resistance of rice.	2017	Sci Rep	The objectives of this study were to explore the mechanism by which the lodging resistance of the rice population during the late growth period responds to low-temperature, overcast and rainy weather during the reproductive growth stage. Field experiments were conducted using indica rice Yliangyou2 (lodging-resistance variety), IIyou084 (lodging-susceptible variety) and japonica rice Wuyunjing23 (lodging-resistance variety) and W3668 (lodging- susceptible variety) in 2013 (high temperature and strong radiation during the rice reproductive growth stage), 2012 and 2014 (low temperature and weak radiation during rice reproductive growth stage). The results showed that the length of the basal internodes and the height of the gravitational centres were greater in plants grown in 2014. Dry weight of basal culms, culm diameter, lignin content and total content of structural carbohydrates (lignin and cellulose) in basal internodes were reduced in these plants, causing a significant reduction in the bending stress and lodging resistance of the rice stems. Low-temperature, overcast and rainy weather had a greater effect on lodging resistance in indica rice compared with japonica rice. This was reflected in a greater reduction in the lignin content of the indica rice stems, which yielded a significantly lower breaking strength and bending stress.
28446328	Combined GC- and UHPLC-HR-MS Based Metabolomics to Analyze Durable Anti-fungal Resistance Processes in Cereals.	2017	Chimia (Aarau)	Introduction of durable resistance genes in crops is an important strategy to prevent yield loss caused by pathogens. The durable multi-pathogen resistance gene Lr34 originating from wheat is widely used in breeding, and is functionally transferable to barley and rice. The molecular resistance mechanism of Lr34, encoding for an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter, is not known yet. To understand the molecular function and the defense response of durable disease resistance in cereals, the metabolic response of Lr34 was investigated in, except for the Lr34 gene, genetically identical lines of barley, rice and wheat. A broad range of compounds including primary, secondary and lipophilic metabolites were analyzed by a combination of gas (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS) based methods. Data from metabolomics correlated well with transcriptomics data for plant defense responses such as the formation of anti-fungal hordatines or the components of the glyoxylate cycle. Induction of the glyoxylate cycle found in transgenic Lr34 rice grown in the greenhouse was confirmed in field-grown natural Lr34 wheat. Constitutively active plant defense responses were observed in the different cereals.
28409435	Aldo-ketoreductase 1 (AKR1) improves seed longevity in tobacco and rice by detoxifying reactive cytotoxic compounds generated during ageing.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Maintenance of seed viability is an important factor for seedling vigour and plant establishment. Lipid peroxidation mediated reactive carbonyl compounds (RCC's) and non-enzymatic modifications of proteins through Maillard and Amadori products reduce seed viability and seedling vigour.

RESULTS: In this study, the relevance of RCCs on genotypic variation in rice seed viability and overexpression of an aldo-ketoreductase (AKR1) enzyme that detoxify cytotoxic compounds to improve seed viability and vigour was studied. Physiological and biochemical approaches were integrated to quantify the variation in seed viability and seedling vigour in rice genotypes after exposing to ageing treatment. AKR1 was overexpressed in a susceptible rice genotype and tobacco to study the relevance of reduced RCC's on seed viability and seedling vigour. The glycation and lipid peroxidation compounds accumulated after accelerated ageing treatments in rice genotypes. The accumulation of malondialdehyde, methyl glyoxal, Maillard and Amadori products affected the seed viability and germination as they showed a significant negative relationship. The transgenic rice and tobacco seeds expressing AKR1 showed lower levels of cytotoxic compounds and glycation products that resulted in improved seed viability and seedling vigour in rice and tobacco.

CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that, reactive cytotoxic compounds affect the seed viability during storage. Detoxification of reactive cytotoxic compounds by Aldo-keto reductases is one of the mechanisms to improve the seed longevity during storage.
28339724	Three cis-Regulatory Motifs, AuxRE, MYCRS1 and MYCRS2, are Required for Modulating the Auxin- and Mycorrhiza-Responsive Expression of a Tomato GH3 Gene.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Auxin is well known to be a key regulator that acts in almost all physiological processes during plant growth, and in interactions between plants and microbes. However, to date, the regulatory mechanisms underlying auxin-mediated plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi symbiosis have not been well deciphered. Previously we identified a GH3 gene, SlGH3.4, strongly responsive to both auxin induction and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we reported a refined dissection of the SlGH3.4 promoter activity using the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter. The SlGH3.4 promoter could drive GUS expression strongly in mycorrhizal roots of soybean and rice plants, and in IAA-treated soybean roots, but not in IAA-treated rice roots. A promoter deletion assay revealed three cis-acting motifs, i.e. the auxin-responsive element, AuxRE, and two newly identified motifs named MYCRS1 and MYCRS2, involved in the activation of auxin- and AM-mediated expression of SlGH3.4. Deletion of the AuxRE from the SlGH3.4 promoter caused almost complete abolition of GUS staining in response to external IAA induction. Seven repeats of AuxRE fused to the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S minimal promoter could direct GUS expression in both IAA-treated and AM fungal-colonized roots of tobacco plants. Four repeats of MYCRS1 or MYCRS2 fused to the CaMV35S minimal promoter was sufficient to drive GUS expression in arbuscule-containing cells, but not in IAA-treated tobacco roots. In summary, our results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential cross-talk between the auxin and the AM regulatory pathways in modulating the expression of AM-responsive GH3 genes in diverse mycorrhizal plants.
28378532	Overexpression of an Arabidopsis thaliana galactinol synthase gene improves drought tolerance in transgenic rice and increased grain yield in the field.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought stress has often caused significant decreases in crop production which could be associated with global warming. Enhancing drought tolerance without a grain yield penalty has been a great challenge in crop improvement. Here, we report the Arabidopsis thaliana galactinol synthase 2 gene (AtGolS2) was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in two different rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes under dry field conditions. The developed transgenic lines expressing AtGolS2 under the control of the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:AtGolS2) also had higher levels of galactinol than the non-transgenic control. The increased grain yield of the transgenic rice under drought conditions was related to a higher number of panicles, grain fertility and biomass. Extensive confined field trials using Ubi:AtGolS2 transgenic lines in Curinga, tropical japonica and NERICA4, interspecific hybrid across two different seasons and environments revealed the verified lines have the proven field drought tolerance of the Ubi:AtGolS2 transgenic rice. The amended drought tolerance was associated with higher relative water content of leaves, higher photosynthesis activity, lesser reduction in plant growth and faster recovering ability. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that AtGolS2 is a useful biotechnological tool to reduce grain yield losses in rice beyond genetic differences under field drought stress.
28378445	Rice No Pollen 1 (NP1) is required for anther cuticle formation and pollen exine patterning.	2017	Plant J	Angiosperm male reproductive organs (anthers and pollen grains) have complex and interesting morphological features, but mechanisms that underlie their patterning are poorly understood. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a male sterile mutant of No Pollen 1 (NP1) in rice (Oryza sativa). The np1-4 mutant exhibited smaller anthers with a smooth cuticle surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and aborted pollen grains covered with irregular exine. Wild-type exine has two continuous layers; but np1-4 exine showed a discontinuous structure with large granules of varying size. Chemical analysis revealed reduction in most of the cutin monomers in np1-4 anthers, and less cuticular wax. Map-based cloning suggested that NP1 encodes a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase; and expression analyses found NP1 preferentially expressed in the tapetal layer from stage 8 to stage 10 of anther development. Additionally, the expression of several genes involved in biosynthesis and in the transport of lipid monomers of sporopollenin and cutin was decreased in np1-4 mutant anthers. Taken together, these observations suggest that NP1 is required for anther cuticle formation, and for patterning of Ubisch bodies and the exine. We propose that products of NP1 are likely important metabolites in the development of Ubisch bodies and pollen exine, necessary for polymerization, assembly, or both.
28339688	An Activity-Staining Method on Filtration Paper Enables High-Throughput Screening of Temperature-Sensitive and Inactive Mutations of Rice α-Amylase for Improvement of Rice Grain Quality.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	α-Amylase is a starch-hydrolyzing enzyme (EC 3.2.1.1) indispensable for germination of cereal seeds, but it is also expressed during the ripening stage. Previous studies demonstrated that the enzyme is activated in developing rice seeds under extremely hot weather and triggers a loss of grain quality by hindering the accumulation of storage starch in the endosperm. Since inactive or, preferably, heat-labile α-amylases are preferable for breeding premium rice, we developed a method for rapid screening of inactive and temperature-sensitive mutants of the enzyme by combining the random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR and an on-filter activity test of the recombinant enzyme expressed by Escherichia coli. This technique was applied to a major α-amylase in the developing seed, Amy3D, and the activity of the isolated mutant enzymes was verified with both the bacteria-expressed recombinant proteins and the extract from the endosperm overexpressing each of them. Then, we identified several substitutions leading to loss of the activity of amino acid residues (Leu28, Asp112, Cys149, Trp201, Asp204, Gly295, Leu300 and Cys342), as well as a variety of heat-sensitive substitutions of Asp83, Asp187 and Glu252. Furthermore, variations of the heat-labile enzymes were created by combining these heat-sensitive mutations. The effects of the respective mutations and their relationship to the structure of the enzyme molecule are discussed.
28416245	A simple and efficient method for CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutant screening.	2017	J Genet Genomics	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system provides a technological breakthrough in mutant generation. Several methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction enzyme (RE) assay, T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay, Surveyor nuclease assay, PAGE-based genotyping assay, and high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis-based assay have been developed for screening CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants. However, these methods are time- and labour-intensive and may also be sequence-limited or require very expensive equipment. Here, we described a cost-effective and sensitive screening technique based on conventional PCR, annealing at critical temperature PCR (ACT-PCR), for identifying mutants. ACT-PCR requires only a single PCR step followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. We demonstrated that ACT-PCR accurately distinguished CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants from wild type in both rice and zebrafish. Moreover, the method can be adapted for accurately determining mutation frequency in cultured cells. The simplicity of ACT-PCR makes it particularly suitable for rapid, large-scale screening of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants in both plants and animals.
28365842	An RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis revealing novel insights into aluminum tolerance and accumulation in tea plant.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The tea plant ( Camellia sinensis L. O. Kuntze) is a high aluminum (Al) tolerant and accumulator species. Candidate genes related to Al tolerance in tea plants were assembled based on de novo transcriptome analysis. The homologs implied some common and distinct Al-tolerant mechanism between tea plants and rice, Arabidopsis and buckwheat. In addition to high Al tolerance, the tea plant exhibits good performance exposure to a proper Al level, and accumulates high Al in the leaves without any toxicity symptom. Therefore, Al was considered as a hyperaccumulator and beneficial element for tea plants. However, the whole-genome molecular mechanisms accounting for Al-tolerance and accumulation remain unknown in tea plants. In this study, transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq following a gradient Al-level exposure was assessed to further reveal candidate genes involved. Totally more than 468 million high-quality reads were generated and 213,699 unigenes were de novo assembled, among which 8922 unigenes were all annotated in the seven databases used. A large number of transporters, transcription factors, cytochrome P450, ubiquitin ligase, organic acid biosynthesis, heat shock proteins differentially expressed in response to high Al (P ≤ 0.05) were identified, which were most likely ideal candidates involved in the Al tolerance or accumulation. Furthermore, a few of the candidate Al-responsive genes related to Al sequestration, cell wall modification and organic acid excretion have been well elucidated as was already found in Arabidopsis, rice, and buckwheat. Thus, some consistent Al-tolerance mechanisms across the species are indicated. In conclusion, the transcriptome data provided useful insights of promising candidates for further characterizing the functions of genes involved in Al tolerance and accumulation in tea plants.
28405745	Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: An albinic rice is caused by mutation of threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which is essential for plant development by stabilizing of NEP and PEP gene expressions and chloroplast protein synthesis. Chloroplast biogenesis and development depend on complex genetic mechanisms. Apart from their function in translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play additional role in gene expression regulation, RNA splicing, and cytokine activity. However, their detailed functions in plant development are still poorly understood. We isolated a lethal albinic seedling (las) mutant in rice. Physiological and ultrastructural analysis of las mutant plants revealed weak chlorophyll fluorescence, negligible chlorophyll accumulation, and defective thylakoid membrane development. By map based cloning we determined that the LAS allele gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS). LAS was constitutively expressed with relatively high level in leaves. NEP-dependent gene transcripts accumulated in the developing chloroplasts, while PEP-dependent transcripts were reduced in the las mutant. This result indicated that PEP activity was impaired. Chloroplast-encoded protein levels were sharply reduced in the las mutant. Biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs (16S and 23S rRNA) was arrested, leading to impaired translation and protein synthesis. Together, our findings indicated that LAS is essential not only for chloroplast development by stabilizing the NEP and PEP gene expression, but also for protein synthesis and construction of the ribosome system in rice chloroplasts.
28455404	A Rice <i>PECTATE LYASE-LIKE</i> Gene Is Required for Plant Growth and Leaf Senescence.	2017	Plant Physiol	To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant growth and leaf senescence in monocot plants, we identified a mutant exhibiting dwarfism and an early-senescence leaf phenotype, termed dwarf and early-senescence leaf1 (del1). Histological analysis showed that the abnormal growth was caused by a reduction in cell number. Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in del1 was affected by the cell cycle. Physiological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and TUNEL assays showed that leaf senescence was triggered by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The DEL1 gene was cloned using a map-based approach. It was shown to encode a pectate lyase (PEL) precursor that contains a PelC domain. DEL1 contains all the conserved residues of PEL and has strong similarity with plant PelC. DEL1 is expressed in all tissues but predominantly in elongating tissues. Functional analysis revealed that mutation of DEL1 decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan, and altered the cell wall composition and structure. In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function- and senescence-related gene expression was altered in del1 plants. Our research indicates that DEL1 is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for plant growth and leaf senescence mediated by PECTATE LYASE-LIKE genes.
28378373	Chloroplast overexpression of rice caffeic acid O-methyltransferase increases melatonin production in chloroplasts via the 5-methoxytryptamine pathway in transgenic rice plants.	2017	J Pineal Res	Recent analyses of the enzymatic features of various melatonin biosynthetic genes from bacteria, animals, and plants have led to the hypothesis that melatonin could be synthesized via the 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) pathway. 5-MT is known to be synthesized in vitro from serotonin by the enzymatic action of O-methyltransferases, including N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), leading to melatonin synthesis by the subsequent enzymatic reaction with serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT). Here, we show that 5-MT was produced and served as a precursor for melatonin synthesis in plants. When rice seedlings were challenged with senescence treatment, 5-MT levels and melatonin production were increased in transgenic rice seedlings overexpressing the rice COMT in chloroplasts, while no such increases were observed in wild-type or transgenic seedlings overexpressing the rice COMT in the cytosol, suggesting a 5-MT transport limitation from the cytosol to chloroplasts. In contrast, cadmium treatment led to results different from those in senescence. The enhanced melatonin production was not observed in the chloroplast COMT lines relative over the cytosol COMT lines although 5-MT levels were equally induced in all genotypes upon cadmium treatment. The transgenic seedlings with enhanced melatonin in their chloroplasts exhibited improved seedling growth vs the wild type under continuous light conditions. This is the first report describing enhanced melatonin production in chloroplasts via the 5-MT pathway with the ectopic overexpression of COMT in chloroplasts in plants.
28418377	The Magnaporthe oryzae nitrooxidative stress response suppresses rice innate immunity during blast disease.	2017	Nat Microbiol	Understanding how microorganisms manipulate plant innate immunity and colonize host cells is a major goal of plant pathology. Here, we report that the fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defences to facilitate the growth and development of the important rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in leaf cells. Nitronate monooxygenases encoded by NMO genes catalyse the oxidative denitrification of nitroalkanes. We show that the M. oryzae NMO2 gene is required for mitigating damaging lipid nitration under nitrooxidative stress conditions and, consequently, for using nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen sources. On plants, the Δnmo2 mutant strain penetrated host cuticles like wild type, but invasive hyphal growth in rice cells was restricted and elicited plant immune responses that included the formation of cellular deposits and a host reactive oxygen species burst. Development of the M. oryzae effector-secreting biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) was misregulated in the Δnmo2 mutant. Inhibiting or quenching host reactive oxygen species suppressed rice innate immune responses and allowed the Δnmo2 mutant to grow and develop normally in infected cells. NMO2 is thus essential for mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage and, in rice cells, maintaining redox balance to avoid triggering plant defences that impact M. oryzae growth and BIC development.
28394310	GW5 acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.	2017	Nat Plants	Grain size is a major determinant of grain yield in cereal crops. qSW5/GW5, which exerts the greatest effect on rice grain width and weight, was fine-mapped to a 2,263-bp/21-kb genomic region containing a 1,212-bp deletion, respectively. Here, we show that a gene encoding a calmodulin binding protein, located ∼5 kb downstream of the 1,212-bp deletion, corresponds to qSW5/GW5. GW5 is expressed in various rice organs, with highest expression level detected in young panicles. We provide evidence that the 1,212-bp deletion affects grain width most likely through influencing the expression levels of GW5. GW5 protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight). Our results suggest that GW5 is a novel positive regulator of BR signalling and a viable target for genetic manipulation to improve grain yield in rice and perhaps in other cereal crops as well.
28404726	Regulation of Strigolactone Biosynthesis by Gibberellin Signaling.	2017	Plant Physiol	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate diverse physiological processes, including shoot branching and root development. They also act as rhizosphere signaling molecules to stimulate the germination of root parasitic weeds and the branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Although various types of cross talk between SLs and other hormones have been reported in physiological analyses, the cross talk between gibberellin (GA) and SLs is poorly understood. We screened for chemicals that regulate the level of SLs in rice (Oryza sativa) and identified GA as, to our knowledge, a novel SL-regulating molecule. The regulation of SL biosynthesis by GA is dependent on the GA receptor GID1 and F-box protein GID2. GA treatment also reduced the infection of rice plants by the parasitic plant witchers weed (Striga hermonthica). These data not only demonstrate, to our knowledge, the novel plant hormone cross talk between SL and GA, but also suggest that GA can be used to control parasitic weed infections.

28351990	An NADPH Oxidase RBOH Functions in Rice Roots during Lysigenous Aerenchyma Formation under Oxygen-Deficient Conditions.	2017	Plant Cell	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the NADPH oxidase, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH), trigger signal transduction in diverse biological processes in plants. However, the functions of RBOH homologs in rice (Oryza sativa) and other gramineous plants are poorly understood. Ethylene induces the formation of lysigenous aerenchyma, which consists of internal gas spaces created by programmed cell death of cortical cells, in roots of gramineous plants under oxygen-deficient conditions. Here, we report that, in rice, one RBOH isoform (RBOHH) has a role in ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation in roots. Induction of RBOHH expression under oxygen-deficient conditions was greater in cortical cells than in cells of other root tissues. In addition, genes encoding group I calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK5 and CDPK13) were strongly expressed in root cortical cells. Coexpression of RBOHH with CDPK5 or CDPK13 induced ROS production in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Inhibitors of RBOH activity or cytosolic calcium influx suppressed ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation. Moreover, knockout of RBOHH by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced ROS accumulation and inducible aerenchyma formation in rice roots. These results suggest that RBOHH-mediated ROS production, which is stimulated by CDPK5 and/or CDPK13, is essential for ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation in rice roots under oxygen-deficient conditions.
28298520	Tissue-Specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	Plant architecture, a collection of genetically controlled agronomic traits, is one of the decisive factors that determine grain production. IDEAL PLANT ARCHITECTURE1 (IPA1) encodes a key transcription factor with pleiotropic effects on regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa), and IPA1 expression is controlled at the posttranscriptional level by microRNA156 and microRNA529. Here, we report the identification and characterization of IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (IPI1), a RING-finger E3 ligase that can interact with IPA1 in the nucleus. IPI1 promotes the degradation of IPA1 in panicles, while it stabilizes IPA1 in shoot apexes. Consistent with these findings, the ipi1 loss-of-function mutants showed markedly altered plant architecture, including more tillers, enlarged panicles, and increased yield per plant. Moreover, IPI1 could ubiquitinate the IPA1-mediated complex with different polyubiquitin chains, adding K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in panicles and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the shoot apex. These results demonstrate that IPI1 affects plant architecture through precisely tuning IPA1 protein levels in different tissues in rice and provide new insight into the tissue-specific regulation of plant architecture and important genetic resources for molecular breeding.
28298519	ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM1 Functions in Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis to Maintain Proper Reactive Oxygen Species Levels for Root Meristem Activity in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	Root meristem activity determines root growth and root architecture and consequently affects water and nutrient uptake in plants. However, our knowledge about the regulation of root meristem activity in crop plants is very limited. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a short root mutant in rice (Oryza sativa) with reduced root meristem activity. This root growth defect is caused by a mutation in ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM1 (AIM1), which encodes a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in β-oxidation. The reduced root meristem activity of aim1 results from reduced salicylic acid (SA) levels and can be rescued by SA application. Furthermore, reduced SA levels are associated with reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aim1, likely due to increased expression of redox and ROS-scavenging-related genes, whose increased expression is (at least in part) caused by reduced expression of the SA-inducible transcriptional repressors WRKY62 and WRKY76. Like SA, ROS application substantially increased root length and root meristem activity in aim1 These results suggest that AIM1 is required for root growth in rice due to its critical role in SA biosynthesis: SA maintains root meristem activity through promoting ROS accumulation by inducing the activity of WRKY transcriptional repressors, which repress the expression of redox and ROS-scavenging genes.
28363779	Genome-wide analysis and expression profiling of the GRF gene family in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.).	2017	Gene	Growth regulating-factors (GRFs) are plant-specific transcription factors that help regulate plant growth and development. Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of GRF gene families have been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, and Brassica rapa, but a comprehensive analysis of the GRF gene family in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) has not yet been reported. In the current study, we identified 35 members of the BnGRF family in B. napus. We analyzed the chromosomal distribution, phylogenetic relationships (Bayesian Inference and Neighbor Joining method), gene structures, and motifs of the BnGRF family members, as well as the cis-acting regulatory elements in their promoters. We also analyzed the expression patterns of 15 randomly selected BnGRF genes in various tissues and in plant varieties with different harvest indices and gibberellic acid (GA) responses. The expression levels of BnGRFs under GA treatment suggested the presence of possible negative feedback regulation. The evolutionary patterns and expression profiles of BnGRFs uncovered in this study increase our understanding of the important roles played by these genes in oilseed rape.

28254780	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by the Ubiquitin-Like Domain Kinase OsUbDKγ4.	2017	Plant Cell	Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait that determines successful seed production and adaptation of crop plants. Photoperiodic control of this process in flowering plants is mediated by the long-distance mobile signal called florigen partly encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana and its orthologs in other plant species. Despite the progress in understanding FT transport in the dicot model Arabidopsis, the mechanisms of florigen transport in monocots, which provide most of the biomass in agriculture, are unknown. Here, we show that rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (OsFTIP1), a member of the family of multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) and the closest ortholog of Arabidopsis FTIP1, is required for export of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) from companion cells to sieve elements. This affects RFT1 movement to the shoot apical meristem and its regulation of rice flowering time under long days. We further reveal that a ubiquitin-like domain kinase γ4, OsUbDKγ4, interacts with OsFTIP1 and modulates its degradation in leaves through the 26S proteasome, which in turn affects RFT1 transport to the shoot apical meristem. Thus, dynamic modulation of OsFTIP1 abundance in leaves by a negative regulator OsUbDKγ4 is integral to the role of OsFTIP1 in mediating RFT1 transport in rice and provides key evidence for a conserved role of FTIP1-like MCTPs in mediating florigen transport in flowering plants.
28366833	Molecular characterization of FMRFamide-like peptides in Meloidogyne graminicola and analysis of their knockdown effect on nematode infectivity.	2017	Gene	The rice root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne graminicola, seriously impairs the growth and yield of rice which is an important staple food worldwide. The disruption of neuropeptide signalling leading to attenuation in nematode behaviour and thereby perturbed infection, offers an attractive alternative to control nematodes. In this direction, the present study was aimed at mining of putative FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) from the transcriptomic dataset of M. graminicola followed by characterization of those FLPs via sequencing of PCR products, qRT-PCR and Southern hybridization analysis. We have characterized nine flp genes (flp-1, flp-3, flp-6, flp-7, flp-11, flp-12, flp-14, flp-16 and flp-18) and a partial neuropeptide receptor gene (flp-18 GPCR) from M. graminicola in the present study. In addition, in situ localization revealed the expression of flp-1 and flp-7 in neurons posterior to the circumpharyngeal nerve ring of M. graminicola. In vitro silencing of nine flp genes and flp-18 GPCR in M. graminicola J2 and their subsequent infection in rice and wheat roots demonstrated the reduced penetration ability of FLP silenced worms which underscores the potential of the FLPergic system as a broad-spectrum target to manage the root-knot nematode problem in rice-wheat cropping system.
28349358	CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1 mediated targeting of a stomatal developmental gene EPFL9 in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 system with its unique gene targeting efficiency, could be an important tool for functional study of early developmental genes through the generation of successful knockout plants. The introduction and utilization of systems biology approaches have identified several genes that are involved in early development of a plant and with such knowledge a robust tool is required for the functional validation of putative candidate genes thus obtained. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 genome editing system has provided a convenient tool for creating loss of function mutants for genes of interest. The present study utilized CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1 technology to knock out an early developmental gene EPFL9 (Epidermal Patterning Factor like-9, a positive regulator of stomatal development in Arabidopsis) orthologue in rice. Germ-line mutants that were generated showed edits that were carried forward into the T2 generation when Cas9-free homozygous mutants were obtained. The homozygous mutant plants showed more than an eightfold reduction in stomatal density on the abaxial leaf surface of the edited rice plants. Potential off-target analysis showed no significant off-target effects. This study also utilized the CRISPR-LbCpf1 (Lachnospiracae bacterium Cpf1) to target the same OsEPFL9 gene to test the activity of this class-2 CRISPR system in rice and found that Cpf1 is also capable of genome editing and edits get transmitted through generations with similar phenotypic changes seen with CRISPR-Cas9. This study demonstrates the application of CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 to precisely target genomic locations and develop transgene-free homozygous heritable gene edits and confirms that the loss of function analysis of the candidate genes emerging from different systems biology based approaches, could be performed, and therefore, this system adds value in the validation of gene function studies.
28248438	TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress during development by interacting with plastidic thioredoxin Z.	2017	New Phytol	Rice is vulnerable to cold stress. Seedlings are very sensitive to cold stress and this harms global rice production. The effects of cold on chloroplast development are well known, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we isolated a temperature-sensitive virescent (tsv) mutant that is extremely sensitive to cold stress. It displayed defective chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll and zero survivorship under cold stress. We isolated and identified TSV by map-based cloning and rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analyses. We found that TSV, a putative plastidic oxidoreductase, is a new type of virescent protein. A mutation in tsv causes premature termination of the gene product. The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the tsv mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures. TSV expression was induced by low temperatures. Strikingly, TSV interacted with OsTrxZ (a subunit of PEP in chloroplasts) and enhanced OsTrxZ stability under low temperatures. We demonstrated that TSV protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ. These results provide novel insights into ways in which rice chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis are protected by TSV under cold stress.
28285416	A naturally occurring conditional albino mutant in rice caused by defects in the plastid-localized OsABCI8 transporter.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	A wide range of molecules are transported across membranes by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Plants possess a collection of ABC proteins bearing similarities to the components of prokaryotic multi subunit ABC transporters, designed as ABC group I. However the functions of most of them are not well understood. Here, we characterized a naturally occurring rice mutant that exhibited albino phenotype under continuous rainy days in the field, but gradually recovered to normal green after the rainy season. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the phenotypes were caused by a mutation in the OsABCI8 that encoded a member of the ABCI family. Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsABCI8 is a chloroplast ABC transporter. Expression of OsABCI8 is significantly enhanced in rainy days compared to sunny days. Besides defects in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis, the mutant phenotype is accompanied by a higher accumulation of iron, suggesting that OsABCI8 is involved in iron transportation and/or homeostasis in rice. Our results demonstrate that OsABCI8 represents a conserved ABCI protein involved in transition metals transportation and/or homeostasis and suggest an important role of the plastid-localized OsABCI8 for chloroplast development.
28357539	Screening of rice mutants with improved saccharification efficiency results in the identification of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The screening of rice mutants with improved cellulose to glucose saccharification efficiency (SE) identifies reduced xylan and/or ferulic acid, and a qualitative change of lignin to impact SE. To ensure the availability of sustainable energy, considerable effort is underway to utilize lignocellulosic plant biomass as feedstock for the production of biofuels. However, the high cost of degrading plant cell wall components to fermentable sugars (saccharification) has been problematic. One way to overcome this barrier is to develop plants possessing cell walls that are amenable to saccharification. In this study, we aimed to identify new molecular factors that influence saccharification efficiency (SE) in rice. By screening 22 rice mutants, we identified two lines, 122 and 108, with improved SE. Reduced xylan and ferulic acid within the cell wall of line 122 were probable reasons of improved SE. Line 108 showed reduced levels of thioglycolic-released lignin; however, the amount of Klason lignin was comparable to the wild-type, indicating that structural changes had occurred in the 108 lignin polymer which resulted in improved SE. Positional cloning revealed that the genes responsible for improved SE in 122 and 108 were rice CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (OsCOP1) and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1 (GH1), respectively, which have not been previously reported to influence SE. The screening of mutants for improved SE is an efficient approach to identify novel genes that affect SE, which is relevant in the development of crops as biofuel sources.
28142196	Absence of OsβCA1 causes a CO<sub>2</sub> deficit and affects leaf photosynthesis and the stomatal response to CO<sub>2</sub> in rice.	2017	Plant J	Plants always adjust the opening of stomatal pores to adapt to the environment, for example CO2 concentration ([CO2 ]), humidity and temperature. Low [CO2 ] will trigger the opening of stomatal pores to absorb extra CO2 . However, little is known about how CO2 supply affects the carbon fixation and opening of stomatal pores in rice. Here, a chloroplast-located gene coding for β-carbonic anhydrase (βCA) was found to be involved in carbon assimilation and the CO2 -mediated stomatal pore response in rice. OsβCA1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its transcripts were induced by high [CO2 ] in leaves. Both T-DNA mutant and RNA interference lines showed phenotypes of lower biomass and CA activities. Knockout of OsβCA1 obviously decreased photosynthetic capacity, as demonstrated by the increased CO2 compensation point and decreased light saturation point in the mutant, while knockout increased the opening ratio of stomatal pores and the rate of water loss. Moreover, the mutant showed a delayed response to low [CO2 ], and stomatal pores could not be closed to the same degree as those of wild type even though the stomatal pores could rapidly respond to high [CO2 ]. Genome-wide gene expression analysis via RNA sequencing demonstrated that the transcript abundance of genes related to Rubisco, photosystem compounds and the opening of stomatal pores was globally upregulated in the mutant. Taken together, the inadequate CO2 supply caused by the absence of OsβCA1 reduces photosynthetic efficiency, triggers the opening of stomatal pores and finally decreases their sensitivity to CO2 fluctuation.
28402719	OsPRA2 fine-tunes rice brassinosteroid receptor.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a kind of plant hormones that regulate many important agronomic traits. Although the framework of the BR signaling pathway has been outlined, detailed working mechanisms at several steps of this pathway, especially at the BR receptor level, need to be further elucidated. Recently we have reported that a rice small G protein, OsPRA2, bound to the BR receptor OsBRI1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and inhibited its kinase activity and its interaction with the co-receptor OsBAK1, leading to a lower sensitivity to BR treatment and dephosphorylation of OsBZR1. In this follow-up study, we identified an OsPRA2-interacting protein through yeast 2 hybrid system, which is annotated as a C2-domain containing GTPase activating protein (OsGAP1). Overexpression of OsGAP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in a phenotype mimic to BR-deficiency, implying that the GTPase activity of OsPRA2 is also involved in regulating BR signaling. In addition, we observed that, besides colocalizing at the PM, OsPRA2 was also colocalized with OsBRI1 in small granules near PM, suggesting that the function of OsPRA2 in vesicle traffic may contribute to the regulation of OsBRI1.
28321650	The small auxin-up RNA OsSAUR45 affects auxin synthesis and transport in rice.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: This research is the first to demonstrate that OsSAUR45 is involved in plant growth though affecting auxin synthesis and transport by repressing OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice. Small auxin-up RNAs (SAURs) comprise a large multigene family and are rapidly activated as part of the primary auxin response in plants. However, little is known about the role of SAURs in plant growth and development, especially in monocots. Here, we report the biological function of OsSAUR45 in the model plant rice (Oryza sativa). OsSAUR45 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern and is localized to the cytoplasm. Rice lines overexpressing OsSAUR45 displayed pleiotropic developmental defects including reduced plant height and primary root length, fewer adventitious roots, narrower leaves, and reduced seed setting. Auxin levels and transport were reduced in the OsSAUR45 overexpression lines, potentially because of decreased expression of Flavin-binding monooxygenase family proteins (OsYUCCAs) and PIN-FORMED family proteins (OsPINs). Exogenous auxin application rapidly induced OsSAUR45 expression and partially restored the phenotype of rice lines overexpressing OsSAUR45. These results demonstrate that OsSAUR45 is involved in plant growth by affecting auxin synthesis and transport through the repression of OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice.
28369589	Bivalent Formation 1, a plant-conserved gene, encodes an OmpH/coiled-coil motif-containing protein required for meiotic recombination in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Meiosis is essential for eukaryotic sexual reproduction and plant fertility. In comparison with over 80 meiotic genes identified in Arabidopsis, there are only ~30 meiotic genes characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Many genes involved in the regulation of meiotic progression remain to be determined. In this study, we identified a sterile rice mutant and cloned a new meiotic gene, OsBVF1 (Bivalent Formation 1) by map-based cloning. Molecular genetics and cytological approaches were carried out to address the function of OsBVF1 in meiosis. Phylogenetic analyses were used to study the evolution of OsBVF1 and its homologs in plant species. Here we showed that the bvf1 male meiocytes were defective in formation of meiotic double strand break, thereby resulting in a failure of bivalent formation in diakinesis and unequal chromosome segregation in anaphase I. The causal gene, OsBVF1, encodes a unique OmpH/coiled-coil motif-containing protein and its homologs are highly conserved in the plant kingdom and seem to be a single-copy gene in the majority of plant species. Our study demonstrates that OsBVF1 is a novel plant-conserved factor involved in meiotic recombination in rice, providing a new insight into understanding of meiotic progression regulation.
28347822	OsMYC2 mediates numerous defence-related transcriptional changes via jasmonic acid signalling in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Jasmonic acid (JA) plays central roles in various events in plants, especially defence against pathogens and insects. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC2 has attracted attention as a master regulator of JA signalling in dicotyledonous plants. However, how MYC2 functions in monocotyledonous plants, including agriculturally important crops such as cultivated rice, has been poorly understood. To elucidate the comprehensive effects of rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) on the JA-inducible transcriptional modifications, we performed RNA-sequencing by using OsMYC2-knockdown plants (osmyc2RNAi). In osmyc2RNAi, JA-inducible expression of many defence-related genes, for example chitinases and proteinase inhibitors, was compromised. Decrease in JA-dependent activation of the biosynthetic pathways of specialised metabolites, especially defence compounds, was also evident in the osmyc2RNAi line. Furthermore, a substantial change was noted in the expression of distinct types of transcription factors, such as MYB-type factors, likely depicting the importance of OsMYC2 in not only defence responses but also other morphogenetic events. Our findings provide fundamental information to understand the overall functions of MYC2 in JA signalling in monocotyledonous plants, which might yield agricultural benefits.
28250070	Mitochondrial ABC Transporter ATM3 Is Essential for Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly.	2017	Plant Physiol	The mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ATM3 has been studied in Arabidopsis. Its function, however, is poorly understood in other model plant species. This study reports that the ATM3 is required for cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly and is essential for meristem maintenance in rice (Oryza sativa). The loss of function of OsATM3 is lethal in rice at the four-leaf stage. In the osatm3 T-DNA insertion mutant, the fourth leaf fails to develop and the lateral roots are short. Cytosolic iron-sulfur protein activities were significantly reduced in both osatm3 and RNA interference transgenic lines. The expression profiles of many iron metabolism genes were altered in the osatm3 and RNA interference lines. Glutathione metabolism was impaired and reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide, accumulated in osatm3 Promoter-β-glucuronidase staining of the transgenic line indicated that OsATM3 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia, root tip meristem zones, and shoot apical meristem regions. The average cell size was significantly greater in osatm3 than in the wild type. Massive cell death occurred in the osatm3 root tip meristem zone. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed transcriptional reprogramming of the genes in the osatm3 and RNAi lines involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial ATM3 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.
28263767	SHR overexpression induces the formation of supernumerary cell layers with cortex cell identity in rice.	2017	Dev Biol	The number of root cortex cell layers varies among plants, and many species have several cortical cell layers. We recently demonstrated that the two rice orthologs of the Arabidopsis SHR gene, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2, could complement the A. thaliana shr mutant. Moreover, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2 expression in A. thaliana roots induced the formation of extra root cortical cell layers. In this article, we demonstrate that the overexpression of AtSHR and OsSHR2 in rice roots leads to plants with wide and short roots that contain a high number of extra cortical cell layers. We hypothesize that SHR genes share a conserved function in the control of cortical cell layer division and the number of ground tissue cell layers in land plants.
28059476	An epiallele of rice AK1 affects photosynthetic capacity.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Epigenetic gene variants, termed epialleles, can broaden genetic and phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes. Here, we identify a natural epiallele of OsAK1, which encodes a rice adenylate kinase. The Epi-ak1 plants show albino in young leaf and panicle with abnormal chloroplast structures. We found that no nucleotide sequence variation but hypermethylation at promoter region caused silencing of OsAK1 (Os08g01770) in Epi-ak1 plants. OsAK1 localizes to chloroplast and many genes associated with photosynthesis processes were downregulated in Epi-ak1. Thus, the work identified a novel rice epiallele caused by DNA methylation changes, shedding light on significant roles of DNA methylation on rice development.
28283922	Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene OsPCS2 involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: The OsPCS2 exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation. Enzymatic activity of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in plant produces phytochelatins, which help in sequestration of heavy metal(loid)s inside the cell vacuole to alleviate toxicity. Here we report that among the two PCS genes-OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 in indica rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar, the OsPCS2 produces an alternatively spliced OsPCS2b transcript that bears the unusual premature termination codon besides the canonically spliced OsPCS2a transcript. Root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced OsPCS2a and OsPCS2b transcript expressions were observed under cadmium stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with OsPCS2a exhibited increased cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) tolerance and accumulation, unlike the OsPCS2b transformed yeast cells. An intron-containing hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing was carried out in endosperm-specific manner for efficient down-regulation of OsPCS genes in rice grains. Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant. Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the OsPCS2 gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.
28342018	Overexpression of OsGATA12 regulates chlorophyll content, delays plant senescence and improves rice yield under high density planting.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	Agronomic traits controlling the formation, architecture and physiology of source and sink organs are main determinants of rice productivity. Semi-dwarf rice varieties with low tiller formation but high seed production per panicle and dark green and thick leaves with prolonged source activity are among the desirable traits to further increase the yield potential of rice. Here, we report the functional characterization of a zinc finger transcription factor, OsGATA12, whose overexpression causes increased leaf greenness, reduction of leaf and tiller number, and affects yield parameters. Reduced tillering allowed testing the transgenic plants under high density which resulted in significantly increased yield per area and higher harvest index compared to wild-type. We show that delayed senescence of transgenic plants and the corresponding longer stay-green phenotype is mainly due to increased chlorophyll and chloroplast number. Further, our work postulates that the increased greenness observed in the transgenic plants is due to more chlorophyll synthesis but most significantly to decreased chlorophyll degradation, which is supported by the reduced expression of genes involved in the chlorophyll degradation pathway. In particular we show evidence for the down-regulation of the STAY GREEN RICE gene and in vivo repression of its promoter by OsGATA12, which suggests a transcriptional repression function for a GATA transcription factor for prolonging the onset of senescence in cereals.
28118490	Overexpression of rice serotonin N-acetyltransferase 1 in transgenic rice plants confers resistance to cadmium and senescence and increases grain yield.	2017	J Pineal Res	While ectopic overexpression of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) in plants has been accomplished using animal SNAT genes, ectopic overexpression of plant SNAT genes in plants has not been investigated. Because the plant SNAT protein differs from that of animals in its subcellular localization and enzyme kinetics, its ectopic overexpression in plants would be expected to give outcomes distinct from those observed from overexpression of animal SNAT genes in transgenic plants. Consistent with our expectations, we found that transgenic rice plants overexpressing rice (Oryza sativa) SNAT1 (OsSNAT1) did not show enhanced seedling growth like that observed in ovine SNAT-overexpressing transgenic rice plants, although both types of plants exhibited increased melatonin levels. OsSNAT1-overexpressing rice plants did show significant resistance to cadmium and senescence stresses relative to wild-type controls. In contrast to tomato, melatonin synthesis in rice seedlings was not induced by selenium and OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants did not show tolerance to selenium. T2 homozygous OsSNAT1 transgenic rice plants exhibited increased grain yield due to increased panicle number per plant under paddy field conditions. These benefits conferred by ectopic overexpression of OsSNAT1 had not been observed in transgenic rice plants overexpressing ovine SNAT, suggesting that plant SNAT functions differently from animal SNAT in plants.
28270131	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	2017	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Xylanase inhibitors have been confirmed to be involved in plant defence. OsXIP is a XIP-type rice xylanase inhibitor, yet its transcriptional regulation remains unknown.

RESULTS: Herbivore infestation, wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment enhanced mRNA levels and protein levels of OsXIP. By analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of OsXIP promoter exposed to rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens stress, a 562 bp region (-1451 - -889) was finally identified as the key sequence for the herbivores stress response. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562 bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay. Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with MeJA resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of OsbHLH59 and OsERF71 in root and shoot tissues.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that two proteins as direct transcriptional activators of OsXIP responding to stress were identified. These results reveal a coordinated regulatory mechanism of OsXIP, which may probably be involved in defence responses via a JA-mediated signaling pathway.
28369864	The rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1 is required for the perception of short-chain chitin oligomers in arbuscular mycorrhizal signaling.	2017	New Phytol	The rice lysin-motif (LysM) receptor-like kinase OsCERK1 is now known to have a dual role in both pathogenic and symbiotic interactions. Following the recent discovery that the Oscerk1 mutant is unable to host arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, we have examined whether OsCERK1 is directly involved in the perception of the short-chain chitin oligomers (Myc-COs) identified in AM fungal exudates and shown to activate nuclear calcium (Ca2+ ) spiking in the rice root epidermis. An Oscerk1 knockout mutant expressing the cameleon NLS-YC2.60 was used to monitor nuclear Ca2+ signaling following root treatment with either crude fungal exudates or purified Myc-COs. Compared with wild-type rice, Ca2+ spiking responses to AM fungal elicitation were absent in root atrichoblasts of the Oscerk1 mutant. By contrast, rice lines mutated in OsCEBiP, encoding the LysM receptor-like protein which associates with OsCERK1 to perceive chitin elicitors of the host immune defense pathway, responded positively to Myc-COs. These findings provide direct evidence that the bi-functional OsCERK1 plays a central role in perceiving short-chain Myc-CO signals and activating the downstream conserved symbiotic signal transduction pathway.
28337744	Knockdown of an inflorescence meristem-specific cytokinin oxidase - OsCKX2 in rice reduces yield penalty under salinity stress condition.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Cytokinins play a significant role in determining grain yield in plants. Cytokinin oxidases catalyse irreversible degradation of cytokinins and hence modulate cellular cytokinin levels. Here, we studied the role of an inflorescence meristem-specific rice cytokinin oxidase - OsCKX2 - in reducing yield penalty under salinity stress conditions. We utilized an RNAi-based approach to study the function of OsCKX2 in maintaining grain yield under salinity stress condition. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-based estimation revealed a significant increase in cytokinins in the inflorescence meristem of OsCKX2-knockdown plants. To determine if there exists a correlation between OsCKX2 levels and yield under salinity stress condition, we assessed the growth, physiology and grain yield of OsCKX2-knockdown plants vis-à-vis the wild type. OsCKX2-knockdown plants showed better vegetative growth, higher relative water content and photosynthetic efficiency and reduced electrolyte leakage as compared with the wild type under salinity stress. Importantly, we found a negative correlation between OsCKX2 expression and plant productivity as evident by assessment of agronomical parameters such as panicle branching, filled grains per plant and harvest index both under control and salinity stress conditions. These results suggest that OsCKX2, via controlling cytokinin levels, regulates floral primordial activity modulating rice grain yield under normal as well as abiotic stress conditions.
28342864	OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors which are involved in many biological process of plant development, including lateral organ development, photomorphogenesis, pathogen response, pollen development and plant regeneration. Here, we report new functions of LBD proteins that participate in the regulation of heading date and yield in rice. OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are two class II type LBD proteins, function as transcriptional activators. Overexpression of OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 separately causes delayed heading date and increased yield. Both OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are expressed in rhythmic pattern, and their proteins are localized in the nucleus. Further analysis revealed that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 delayed heading date by down-regulating the expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 through key regulator of heading date Ehd1. These data indicates that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, may function as novel regulators of heading date and crop yield in rice.
28267270	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	The plant hormone auxin plays a crucial role in lateral root development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lateral root formation, an auxin-responsive gene OsCYP2 (Os02g0121300) was characterized from rice. Compared to the wild type, OsCYP2-RNAi (RNA interference) lines exhibited distinctive defects in lateral root development. Yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus. T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild-type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of certain Aux/IAA (auxin/indole-3-acetic acid) genes was altered in OsCYP2- and OsZFP-RNAi lines in response to IAA. These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development. More importantly, OsIAA11 showed functional redundancy not only in OsCYP2-RNAi lines but also in OsZFP-RNAi lines, which provides important clues for the elucidation of mechanisms controlling lateral root development in response to auxin.
28301324	Response of alternative splice isoforms of OsRad9 gene from Oryza sativa to environmental stress.	2017	Z Naturforsch C	Rad9 protein plays an important role in cell-cycle checkpoint signal transduction in human and yeast cells, but knowledge about Rad9 in plants is limited. This study reports that the Rad9 gene of rice can generate the transcript products OsRad9.1 and OsRad9.2 through alternative splicing. OsRad9.1, with all nine exons, is the main cell-cycle checkpoint protein involved in the response of rice to genotoxic stresses (ultraviolet radiation and antibiotic stress), environmental stresses (drought, salt, and heavy metal stress), and auxin stimuli (2,4-D, IAA, and IBA). Meanwhile, transcript isoform OsRad9.2, which lost exon7 and exon8, showed different preferential stimulation effects on these stresses and pollen development duration. These results might indicat that besides the monitoring and repair of DNA damage, Rad9 might involve in the development of pollen.
28369540	The 2'-O-methyladenosine nucleoside modification gene OsTRM13 positively regulates salt stress tolerance in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Stress induces changes of modified nucleosides in tRNA, and these changes can influence codon-anticodon interaction and therefore the translation of target proteins. Certain nucleoside modification genes are associated with regulation of stress tolerance and immune response in plants. In this study, we found a dramatic increase of 2'-O-methyladenosine (Am) nucleoside in rice seedlings subjected to salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified LOC_Os03g61750 (OsTRM13) as a rice candidate methyltransferase for the Am modification. OsTRM13 transcript levels increased significantly upon salt stress and ABA treatment, and the OsTrm13 protein was found to be located primarily to the nucleus. More importantly, OsTRM13 overexpression plants displayed improved salt stress tolerance, and vice versa, OsTRM13 RNA interference (RNAi) plants showed reduced tolerance. Furthermore, OsTRM13 complemented a yeast trm13Δ mutant, deficient in Am synthesis, and the purified OsTrm13 protein catalysed Am nucleoside formation on tRNA-Gly-GCC in vitro. Our results show that OsTRM13, encoding a rice tRNA nucleoside methyltransferase, is an important regulator of salt stress tolerance in rice.
28371870	Conservation of Chitin-Induced MAPK Signaling Pathways in Rice and Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) including chitin by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) rapidly induces activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. However, how PRRs transmit immune signals to the MAPK cascade is largely unknown. Recently, Arabidopsis receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBL27 has been reported to activate MAPKs through phosphorylation of AtMAPKKK5 in the chitin signaling pathway. In this study, we found that OsRLCK185, a rice ortholog of PBL27, regulates chitin-induced MAPK activation in a similar fashion to PBL27 in rice. Upon chitin perception, OsRLCK185 is phosphorylated by OsCERK1, a component of the chitin receptor complex. OsRLCK185 interacted with OsMAPKKK11 and OsMAPKKK18, rice orthologs of AtMAPKKK5, in yeast two-hybrid assays. Silencing of both OsMAPKKK11 and OsMAPKKK18 significantly reduced chitin-induced activation of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. Expression levels of OsMAPKKK18 were much higher than that of OsMAPKKK11 in rice cells, which was consistent with the fact that the Osmapkkk11 single mutation did not affect MAPK activation. This result suggested that OsMAPKKK18 plays a more important role than OsMAPKKK11 in the chitin-induced activation of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiment indicated that OsRLCK185 interacted with OsMAPKKK18 at the plasma membrane in planta. In vitro phosphorylation experiments showed that OsRLCK185 directly phosphorylates OsMAPKKK18. Furthermore, OsMAPKKK18 interacted with the MAPKK OsMKK4, the upstream component of OsMPK3/6. These results suggested that OsRLCK185 connects the chitin receptor to the MAPK cascade consisting of OsMAPKKK18-OsMKK4-OsMPK3/6. Our data revealed that chitin-induced MAPK activation in rice and Arabidopsis is regulated by common homologous elements.
28272449	Design and Functional Characterization of a Novel Abscisic Acid Analog.	2017	Sci Rep	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in mediating plant growth and development by recruiting genetically redundant ABA receptors. To overcome its oxidation inactivation, we developed a novel ABA analog named 2',3'-benzo-iso-ABA (iso-PhABA) and studied its function and structural characterization with A. thaliana ABA receptors. The (+)-iso-PhABA form showed much higher ABA-like activities than (+)-ABA including inhibitory effects on the seed germination of lettuce and A. thaliana, wheat embryo germination and rice seedling elongation. The PP2C (protein phosphatases 2C) activity assay showed that (+)-iso-PhABA acted as a potent and selective ABA receptor agonist, which is preferred to PYL10. In some cases, (-)-iso-PhABA showed moderate to high activity for the PYL protein inhibiting PP2C activity, suggesting different mechanisms of action of iso-PhABA and ABA. The complex crystal structure of iso-PhABA with PYL10 was determined and elucidated successfully, revealing that (+)-iso-PhABA was better coordinated in the same binding pocket compared to (+)-ABA. Moreover, the detailed interaction network of iso-PhABA/PYL10 was disclosed and involves hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic interactions that provide a robust framework for the design of novel ABA receptor agonists/antagonists.
28369656	Two maize Kip-related proteins differentially interact with, inhibit and are phosphorylated by cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.	2017	J Exp Bot	The family of maize Kip-related proteins (KRPs) has been studied and a nomenclature based on the relationship to rice KRP genes is proposed. Expression studies of KRP genes indicate that all are expressed at 24 h of seed germination but expression is differential in the different tissues of maize plantlets. Recombinant KRP1;1 and KRP4;2 proteins, members of different KRP classes, were used to study association to and inhibitory activity on different maize cyclin D (CycD)-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. Kinase activity in CycD2;2-CDK, CycD4;2-CDK, and CycD5;3-CDK complexes was inhibited by both KRPs; however, only KRP1;1 inhibited activity in the CycD6;1-CDK complex, not KRP4;2. Whereas KRP1;1 associated with either CycD2;2 or CycD6;1, and to cyclin-dependent kinase A (CDKA) recombinant proteins, forming ternary complexes, KRP4;2 bound CDKA and CycD2;2 but did not bind CycD6;1, establishing a differential association capacity. All CycD-CDK complexes included here phosphorylated both the retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein and the two KRPs; interestingly, while KRP4;2 phosphorylated by the CycD2;2-CDK complex increased its inhibitory capacity, when phosphorylated by the CycD6;1-CDK complex the inhibitory capacity was reduced or eliminated. Evidence suggests that the phosphorylated residues in KRP4;2 may be different for every kinase, and this would influence its performance as a cyclin-CDK inhibitor.
28370092	Expression of lima bean terpene synthases in rice enhances recruitment of a beneficial enemy of a major rice pest.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Volatile terpenoids play a key role in plant defence against herbivory by attracting parasitic wasps. We identified seven terpene synthase genes from lima bean, Phaseolus lunatus L. following treatment with either the elicitor alamethicin or spider mites, Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Four of the genes (Pltps2, Pltps3, Pltps4 and Pltps5) were up-regulated with their derived proteins phylogenetically clustered in the TPS-g subfamily and PlTPS3 positioned at the base of this cluster. Recombinant PlTPS3 was able to convert geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate to linalool and (E)-nerolidol, the latter being precursor of the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). Recombinant PlTPS4 showed a different substrate specificity and produced linalool and (E)-nerolidol, as well as (E,E)-geranyllinalool from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Transgenic rice expressing Pltps3 emitted significantly more (S)-linalool and DMNT than wild-type plants, whereas transgenic rice expressing Pltps4 produced (S)-linalool, DMNT and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT). In laboratory bioassays, female Cotesia chilonis, the natural enemy of the striped rice stemborer, Chilo suppressalis, were significantly attracted to the transgenic plants and their volatiles. We further confirmed this with synthetic blends mimicking natural rice volatile composition. Our study demonstrates that the transformation of rice to produce volatile terpenoids has the potential to enhance plant indirect defence through natural enemy recruitment.
28292258	Production of BP178, a derivative of the synthetic antibacterial peptide BP100, in the rice seed endosperm.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: BP178 peptide is a synthetic BP100-magainin derivative possessing strong inhibitory activity against plant pathogenic bacteria, offering a great potential for future applications in plant protection and other fields. Here we report the production and recovery of a bioactive BP178 peptide using rice seeds as biofactories.

RESULTS: A synthetic gene encoding the BP178 peptide was prepared and introduced in rice plants. The gene was efficiently expressed in transgenic rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter. Among the three endosperm-specific rice promoters (Glutelin B1, Glutelin B4 or Globulin 1), best results were obtained when using the Globulin 1 promoter. The BP178 peptide accumulated in the seed endosperm and was easily recovered from rice seeds using a simple procedure with a yield of 21 μg/g. The transgene was stably inherited for at least three generations, and peptide accumulation remained stable during long term storage of transgenic seeds. The purified peptide showed in vitro activity against the bacterial plant pathogen Dickeya sp., the causal agent of the dark brown sheath rot of rice. Seedlings of transgenic events showed enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, supporting that the in planta produced peptide was biologically active.

CONCLUSIONS: The strategy developed in this work for the sustainable production of BP178 peptide using rice seeds as biofactories represents a promising system for future production of peptides for plant protection and possibly in other fields.
28370563	Short and Solid Culm/RFL/APO2 for culm development in rice.	2017	Plant J	The culm development of rice is characterized by elongation and medullary cavity (MC) formation, which are determined by node formation meristem and residual meristem, respectively. Although many factors have been shown to affect culm elongation, molecules involved in MC formation remained to be identified. In this study, we show that a point mutation in SHORT and SOLID CULM (SSC), the rice homologue of Arabidopsis LFY, resulted in plants with drastically reduced culm length and completely abolished MC formation. Analysis of transgenic plants with moderately enhanced SSC expression revealed significant decreases in plant height and MC size in contrast to slight changes in heading date, indicating that the culm developmental process is much more tightly monitored by the gene. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the differential expression of knotted-1 like homeobox (KNOX) protein genes and gibberellin (GA) metabolic genes in the ssc mutant background, and most of the genes contained well-conserved LFY-binding cis-elements that could be effectively recognized by SSC. Genetic analysis found that the reduced culm length of the mutant could be largely rescued by the GA-accumulating mutation eui, whereas MC formation remained unchanged in the double mutant plants. Taken together, our results suggest that SSC affects culm elongation mainly through maintaining GA homeostasis, while functions in MC formation by mediating residual meristem activity possibly via the KNOX pathway. The present study provides a potential strategy for improving the culm morphology and plant architecture in rice by manipulating SSC and/or its downstream components.
28363873	Production of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase with high-mannose glycans in gnt1 rice for the treatment of Pompe disease.	2017	J Biotechnol	Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders. Patients are treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in which the replacement enzymes are required to carry terminal mannose or mannose 6-phosphate residues to allow efficient uptake into target cells and tissues. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (GnTI) mediates N-glycosylation in the cis cisternae of the Golgi apparatus by adding N-acetylglucosamine to the exposed terminal mannose residue of core N-glycan structures for further processing. Mutant rice lacking GnTI produces only high mannosylated glycoproteins. In this study, we introduced a gene encoding recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA), which is used in ERT for Pompe disease, into gnt1 rice callus by particle bombardment. Integration of the target gene into the genome of the gnt1 rice line and its mRNA expression were confirmed by PCR and Northern blot, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm secretion of the target proteins into the culture media. Using an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the maximum expression of rhGAA to be approximately 45mg/L, 13days after induction. To assay the enzymatic activity and determine the N-glycan profile of rhGAA, we purified the protein using a 6×histidine tag. The in vitro α-glucosidase activity of rhGAA from gnt1 rice callus (gnt1-GAA) was 3.092U/mg, similar to the activity of the Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived GAA (3.154U/mg). N-glycan analysis revealed the presence of high-mannose N-glycans on gnt1-GAA. In addition, the production of high-mannose GAA using gnt1 rice calli as an expression host was characterized, which may aid the future development of therapeutic enzymes for the treatment of Pompe disease.
28278368	Dynamic metabolic responses of brown planthoppers towards susceptible and resistant rice plants.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål, BPH) causes huge economic losses in rice-growing regions, and new strategies for combating BPH are required. To understand how BPHs respond towards BPH-resistant plants, we systematically analysed the metabolic differences between BPHs feeding on the resistant and susceptible plants using NMR and GC-FID/MS. We also measured the expression of some related genes involving glycolysis and biosyntheses of trehalose, amino acids, chitin and fatty acids using real-time PCR. BPH metabonome was dominated by more than 60 metabolites including fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleosides/nucleotides and TCA cycle intermediates. After initial 12 h, BPHs feeding on the resistant plants had lower levels of amino acids, glucose, fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediates than on the susceptible ones. The levels of these metabolites recovered after 24 h feeding. This accompanied with increased level in trehalose, choline metabolites and nucleosides/nucleotides compared with BPH feeding on the susceptible plants. Decreased levels of BPH metabolites at the early feeding probably resulted from less BPH uptakes of sap from resistant plants and recovery of BPH metabolites at the later stage probably resulted from their adaptation to the adverse environment with their increased hopping frequency to ingest more sap together with contributions from yeast-like symbionts in BPHs. Throughout 96 h, BPH feeding on the resistant plants showed significant up-regulation of chitin synthase catalysing biosynthesis of chitin for insect exoskeleton, peritrophic membrane lining gut and tracheae. These findings provided useful metabolic information for understanding the BPH-rice interactions and perhaps for developing new BPH-combating strategies.
28273925	Sorghum DW1 positively regulates brassinosteroid signaling by inhibiting the nuclear localization of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2.	2017	Sci Rep	Semi-dwarf traits have been widely introgressed into cereal crops to improve lodging resistance. In sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), four major unlinked dwarfing genes, Dw1-Dw4, have been introduced to reduce plant height, and among them, Dw3 and Dw1 have been cloned. Dw3 encodes a gene involved in auxin transport, whereas, Dw1 was recently isolated and identified as a gene encoding a protein of unknown function. In this study, we show that DW1 is a novel component of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sorghum possessing the mutated allele of Dw1 (dw1), showed similar phenotypes to rice BR-deficient mutants, such as reduced lamina joint bending, attenuated skotomorphogenesis, and insensitivity against feedback regulation of BR-related genes. Furthermore, DW1 interacted with a negative regulator of BR signaling, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2), and inhibited its nuclear localization, indicating that DW1 positively regulates BR signaling by inhibiting the function of BIN2. In contrast to rice and wheat breeding which used gibberellin (GA) deficiency to reduce plant height, sorghum breeding modified auxin and BR signaling. This difference may result from GA deficiency in rice and wheat does not cause deleterious side effects on plant morphology, whereas in sorghum it leads to abnormal culm bending.
28412605	Brachytic 1 of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) encodes the α subunit of heterotrimeric G protein.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Physiological and molecular biological analysis of the dwarf barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutant brachytic 1 (brh1) was conducted. The root responses of brh1 to brassinolide were weaker than those of wild type, but the responses of leaf segments of dark-grown plants were not. Responses of brh1 to gibberellin A3 were similar to or slightly stronger than those of wild type. Endogenous levels of these hormones in young seedlings were not clearly different between brh1 and wild type. Skotomorphogeneses of brh1 were similar to those of wild type. Some of these physiological characteristics of brh1 resemble those of the dwarf rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant daikoku (dwarf1; d1), whose dwarfism is caused by a mutation in the heterotrimeric G protein α (Gα) subunit. A database search indicated that the barley Gα gene is located near the locus where Brh1 has already been genetically mapped. Sequences of the Gα gene and cDNAs of five brh1 alleles contained substitutions and a deletion that lead to the production of abnormal Gα proteins. These results indicate that the phenotype of brh1, similarly to that of d1, is caused by mutations in an orthologous gene encoding Gα.
28087663	Evolution and structural diversification of Nictaba-like lectin genes in food crops with a focus on soybean (Glycine max).	2017	Ann Bot	Background and Aims: The Nictaba family groups all proteins that show homology to Nictaba, the tobacco lectin. So far, Nictaba and an Arabidopsis thaliana homologue have been shown to be implicated in the plant stress response. The availability of more than 50 sequenced plant genomes provided the opportunity for a genome-wide identification of Nictaba -like genes in 15 species, representing members of the Fabaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae, Musaceae, Arecaceae, Malvaceae and Rubiaceae. Additionally, phylogenetic relationships between the different species were explored. Furthermore, this study included domain organization analysis, searching for orthologous genes in the legume family and transcript profiling of the Nictaba -like lectin genes in soybean.

Methods: Using a combination of BLASTp, InterPro analysis and hidden Markov models, the genomes of Medicago truncatula , Cicer arietinum , Lotus japonicus , Glycine max , Cajanus cajan , Phaseolus vulgaris , Theobroma cacao , Solanum lycopersicum , Solanum tuberosum , Coffea canephora , Oryza sativa , Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor , Musa acuminata and Elaeis guineensis were searched for Nictaba -like genes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using RAxML and additional protein domains in the Nictaba-like sequences were identified using InterPro. Expression analysis of the soybean Nictaba -like genes was investigated using microarray data.

Key Results: Nictaba -like genes were identified in all studied species and analysis of the duplication events demonstrated that both tandem and segmental duplication contributed to the expansion of the Nictaba gene family in angiosperms. The single-domain Nictaba protein and the multi-domain F-box Nictaba architectures are ubiquitous among all analysed species and microarray analysis revealed differential expression patterns for all soybean Nictaba-like genes.

Conclusions: Taken together, the comparative genomics data contributes to our understanding of the Nictaba -like gene family in species for which the occurrence of Nictaba domains had not yet been investigated. Given the ubiquitous nature of these genes, they have probably acquired new functions over time and are expected to take on various roles in plant development and defence.
28369596	Paralogs and mutants show that one DMA synthase functions in iron homeostasis in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Rice (Oryza sativa) secretes 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) to acquire insoluble iron (Fe) from the rhizosphere. In rice, DMA is synthesized by DMA synthase 1 (OsDMAS1), a member of the aldo-keto reductase super family. We screened OsDMAS1 paralogs for DMA synthesis. None of these paralogs displayed in vitro DMA synthesis activity, suggesting that rice only harbors one functional DMAS. We further characterized OsDMAS1 mutant plants. We failed to screen homozygous knock-out plants (dmas-1), so we characterized DMAS knock-down plants (dmas-kd1 and dmas-kd2). Under Fe-deficient conditions, dmas-kd1 plants were more chlorotic compared to the wild-type (WT) plants, and the expression of OsNAS3, OsYSL2, OsIRT1, and OsIRO2 was significantly up-regulated in the dmas-kd1 mutant, indicating that metal homeostasis was significantly disturbed. The secretion of DMA in dmas-kd1 was not significantly reduced. The dmas-kd1 plants accumulated less Fe in their roots compared to WT plants when grown with 10 μM FeSO4. The dmas-kd1 plants accumulated more Zn in their roots compared to WT plants under Fe-deficient, Fe-EDTA, and FeSO4 conditions. In both dehusked rice seeds (brown rice) and polished rice, no differences were observed for Fe, Cu, or Mn accumulation, whereas dmas-kd1 seeds significantly accumulated more Zn in brown rice. Our data suggests that rice only harbors one functional gene for DMA synthesis. In addition, the knock-down of OsDMAS1 significantly up-regulates the genes involved in Fe uptake and homeostasis.
28349304	Rapid generation of genetic diversity by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in rice.	2017	Sci China Life Sci	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has emerged as a promising technology for specific genome editing in many species. Here we constructed one vector targeting eight agronomic genes in rice using the CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex genome editing system. By subsequent genetic transformation and DNA sequencing, we found that the eight target genes have high mutation efficiencies in the T0 generation. Both heterozygous and homozygous mutations of all editing genes were obtained in T0 plants. In addition, homozygous sextuple, septuple, and octuple mutants were identified. As the abundant genotypes in T0 transgenic plants, various phenotypes related to the editing genes were observed. The findings demonstrate the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for rapid introduction of genetic diversity during crop breeding.
28370170	Genome-wide association mapping for phenotypic plasticity in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Phenotypic plasticity of plants in response to environmental changes is important for adapting to changing climate. Less attention has been paid to exploring the advantages of phenotypic plasticity in resource-rich environments to enhance the productivity of agricultural crops. Here, we examined genetic variation for phenotypic plasticity in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) across two diverse panels: (1) a Phenomics of Rice Adaptation and Yield (PRAY) population comprising 301 accessions; and (2) a Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) indica population comprising 151 accessions. Altered planting density was used as a proxy for elevated atmospheric CO2 response. Low planting density significantly increased panicle weight per plant compared with normal density, and the magnitude of the increase ranged from 1.10 to 2.78 times among accessions for the PRAY population and from 1.05 to 2.45 times for the MAGIC population. Genome-wide-association studies validate three Environmental Responsiveness (ER) candidate alleles (qER1-3) that were associated with relative response of panicle weight to low density. Two of these alleles were tested in 13 genotypes to clarify their biomass responses during vegetative growth under elevated CO2 in Japan. Our study provides evidence for polymorphisms that control rice phenotypic plasticity in environments that are rich in resources such as light and CO2 .
28299373	Examining two sets of introgression lines reveals background-independent and stably expressed QTL that improve grain appearance quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A novel QTL cluster for appearance quality on Chr07 was identified using reciprocal introgression populations in different locations in China. Two secondary F 2 populations validated QTL with significant effect on appearance quality. Appearance quality (AQ) is the main determinants of market value of rice. Identification of QTL affecting AQ is the prerequisite for efficient improvement of AQ through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Two sets of reciprocal introgression lines derived from indica Minghui 63 and japonica 02428 were used to dissect the stability of QTL affecting five AQ traits, including grain length, grain width, length to width ratio, percentage of grains with chalkiness, and degree of endosperm chalkiness using 4568 bin genotype produced from 58,000 SNPs across five different environments. A total of 41 and 30 main-effect QTL were identified in MH63 and 02428 backgrounds, respectively. Among them, 9 background-independent QTL (BI-QTL) were found. There were also 13 and 10 stable-expressed QTL (SE-QTL) across at least two environments in MH63 and 02428 backgrounds, respectively. Two important BI- and SE-QTL regions (BISERs) including BISER-I harboring qPGWC5, qDEC5, qGW5.1, and qLWR5 on chromosome 5 and BISER-II harboring qGL7, qLWR7, qPGWC7, and qDEC7 on chromosome 7 were identified. The BISER-II was newly reported and validated by two secondary F2 populations in the reciprocal backgrounds. Among 59 epistatic QTL (E-QTL) detected in this study, there were only four SE- but no BI-E-QTL detected in different environments, indicating that genetic background has stronger effect on AQ traits than the environmental factors, especially for percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) and degree of endosperm chalkiness (DEC) with lower heritability. BISER-I and BISER-II harboring many BI- and SE-QTL with favorable alleles from slender grain rice are much important for improvement of rice AQ by MAS.
28288591	Correlates of thymus size and changes during treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition: a cohort study.	2017	BMC Pediatr	BACKGROUND: The impairment of immune functions associated with malnutrition may be one reason for the high mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), and thymus atrophy has been proposed as a marker of this immunodeficiency. The aim of this study was to identify nutritional and clinical correlates of thymus size in children with SAM, and predictors of change in thymus size with nutritional rehabilitation.

METHODS: In an observational study among children aged 6-59 months admitted with SAM in Uganda, we measured thymus area by ultrasound on hospital admission to treatment with F75 and F100, on hospital discharge and after 8 weeks of nutritional rehabilitation with ready-to-use therapeutic food, as well as in well-nourished healthy children. We investigated anthropometric, clinical, biochemical and treatment-related correlates of area and growth of the thymus.

RESULTS: Eighty-five children with SAM with a median age of 16.5 months were included. On admission 27% of the children had a thymus undetectable by ultrasound. Median thymus area was 1.3 cm2 in malnourished children, and 3.5 cm2 in healthy children (p < 0.001). Most anthropometric z-scores, hemoglobin and plasma phosphate correlated positively with thymus area. Thymus area correlated negatively with caretaker-reported severity of illness, plasma α-1 acid glycoprotein, and C-reactive protein >5 mg/L. At follow-up after 8 weeks, median thymus area had increased to 2.5 cm2 (p < 0.001). Increase in thymus area during treatment was associated with simultaneous increase in mid-upper-arm circumference, with 0.29 cm2 higher increase in thymus area per cm larger increment in MUAC (p = 0.03). Children whose F-75 had partially been replaced by rice porridge during their hospital admission had less increase in thymus area after 8 weeks.

CONCLUSION: Malnutrition and inflammation are associated with thymus atrophy, and thymus area seems positively associated with plasma phosphate. Substituting therapeutic formula with unfortified rice porridge with the aim of alleviating diarrhea may impair regain of thymus size with nutritional rehabilitation. This calls for research into possible effects of phosphate status on thymus size and other immunological markers.

TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is based on data from the FeedSAM study, ISRCTN55092738 .
28275855	Expression of cold and drought regulatory protein (CcCDR) of pigeonpea imparts enhanced tolerance to major abiotic stresses in transgenic rice plants.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Transgenic rice expressing pigeonpea Cc CDR conferred high-level tolerance to different abiotic stresses. The multiple stress tolerance observed in CcCDR -transgenic lines is attributed to the modulation of ABA-dependent and-independent signalling-pathway genes. Stable transgenic plants expressing Cajanus cajan cold and drought regulatory protein encoding gene (CcCDR), under the control of CaMV35S and rd29A promoters, have been generated in indica rice. Different transgenic lines of CcCDR, when subjected to drought, salt, and cold stresses, exhibited higher seed germination, seedling survival rates, shoot length, root length, and enhanced plant biomass when compared with the untransformed control plants. Furthermore, transgenic plants disclosed higher leaf chlorophyll content, proline, reducing sugars, SOD, and catalase activities, besides lower levels of MDA. Localization studies revealed that the CcCDR-GFP fusion protein was mainly present in the nucleus of transformed cells of rice. The CcCDR transgenics were found hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) and showed reduced seed germination rates as compared to that of control plants. When the transgenic plants were exposed to drought and salt stresses at vegetative and reproductive stages, they revealed larger panicles and higher number of filled grains compared to the untransformed control plants. Under similar stress conditions, the expression levels of P5CS, bZIP, DREB, OsLEA3, and CIPK genes, involved in ABA-dependent and-independent signal transduction pathways, were found higher in the transgenic plants than the control plants. The overall results amply demonstrate that the transgenic rice expressing CcCDR bestows high-level tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stress conditions. Accordingly, the CcCDR might be deployed as a promising candidate gene for improving the multiple stress tolerance of diverse crop plants.
28264650	Genetic basis of allochronic differentiation in the fall armyworm.	2017	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Very little is known on how changes in circadian rhythms evolve. The noctuid moth Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) consists of two strains that exhibit allochronic differentiation in their mating time, which acts as a premating isolation barrier between the strains. We investigated the genetic basis of the strain-specific timing differences to identify the molecular mechanisms of differentiation in circadian rhythms.

RESULTS: Through QTL analyses we identified one major Quantitative trait chromosome (QTC) underlying differentiation in circadian timing of mating activity. Using RADtags, we identified this QTC to be homologous to Bombyx mori C27, on which the clock gene vrille is located, which thus became the major candidate gene. In S. frugiperda, vrille showed strain-specific polymorphisms. Also, vrille expression differed significantly between the strains, with the rice-strain showing higher expression levels than the corn-strain. In addition, RT-qPCR experiments with the other main clock genes showed that pdp1, antagonist of vrille in the modulatory feedback loop of the circadian clock, showed higher expression levels in the rice-strain than in the corn-strain.

CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results indicate that the allochronic differentiation in the two strains of S. frugiperda is associated with differential transcription of vrille or a cis-acting gene close to vrille, which contributes to the evolution of prezygotic isolation in S. frugiperda.
28293806	Morpho-physiological and transcriptome profiling reveal novel zinc deficiency-responsive genes in rice.	2017	Funct Integr Genomics	Intensive farming has depleted the soil zinc (Zn) availability resulting in decreased crop productivity. Here, we attempt to understand the Zn deficiency response in rice through temporal transcriptome analysis. For this, rice seedlings were raised under Zn-deficient conditions up to 4 weeks followed by Zn re-supply for 3 days. Zn-deficient plants developed characteristic deficiency symptoms such as leaf bronzing, decrease in biomass, total chlorophyll, PSII efficiency, decreased carbonic anhydrase activity and increased ROS production. Interestingly, severe alterations in root system architecture were also observed. Comprehensive transcriptome analyses of rice seedlings were carried out after 2 (DEF2W) and 4 weeks (DEF4W) of Zn deficiency with respect to transcriptome profiles of corresponding Zn sufficient conditions (SUF2W, SUF4W). Additionally, to detect the potential Zn-responsive genes, transcriptome profile of Zn-recovered seedlings was compared with DEF4W. All differentially expressed Zn-responsive genes were categorized into early and late Zn deficiency response, and a set of 77 genes, induced and repressed on Zn deficiency and re-supply, respectively, was identified. These genes could be used as low Zn-responsive marker genes. Further, genes involved in membrane transport, phytosiderophore activity and organic acid biosynthesis showed high differential expression. Additionally, the present study unravelled several genes putatively associated with alterations in root system architecture under Zn deficiency and provides novel insights into the interpretation of morpho-physiological, biochemical and molecular regulation of zinc deficiency responses in rice.
28346401	Targeted base editing in rice and tomato using a CRISPR-Cas9 cytidine deaminase fusion.	2017	Nat Biotechnol	We applied a fusion of CRISPR-Cas9 and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (Target-AID) for point mutagenesis at genomic regions specified by single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in two crop plants. In rice, we induced multiple herbicide-resistance point mutations by multiplexed editing using herbicide selection, while in tomato we generated marker-free plants with homozygous heritable DNA substitutions, demonstrating the feasibility of base editing for crop improvement.
28167027	Development of an inducible male-sterility system in rice through pollen-specific expression of l-ornithinase (argE) gene of E. coli.	2017	Plant Sci	In the present investigation, an inducible male-sterility system has been developed in the rice. In order to introduce inducible male-sterility, the coding region of l-ornithinase (argE) gene of E. coli was fused to the Oryza sativa indica pollen allergen (OSIPA) promoter sequence which is known to function specifically in the pollen grains. Transgenic plants were obtained with argE gene and the transgenic status of plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the tissue-specific expression of argE in the anthers of transgenic rice plants. Transgenic rice plants expressing argE, after application of N-acetyl-phosphinothricin (N-ac-PPT), became completely male-sterile owing to the pollen-specific expression of argE. However, argE-transgenic plants were found to be self fertile when N-ac-PPT was not applied. Normal fertile seeds were obtained from the cross pollination between male-sterile argE transgenics and untransformed control plants, indicating that the female fertility is not affected by the N-ac-PPT treatment. These results clearly suggest that the expression of argE gene affects only the male gametophyte but not the gynoecium development. Induction of complete male-sterility in the rice is a first of its kind, and moreover this male- sterility system does not require the deployment of any specific restorer line.
28285407	Novel 9-cis/all-trans β-carotene isomerases from plastidic oil bodies in Dunaliella bardawil catalyze the conversion of all-trans to 9-cis β-carotene.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: We identified and demonstrated the function of 9-cis/all-trans β-carotene isomerases in plastidic globules of Dunaliella bardawil, the species accumulating the highest levels of 9-cis β-carotene that is essential for humans. The halotolerant alga Dunaliella bardawil is unique in that it accumulates under light stress high levels of β-carotene in plastidic lipid globules. The pigment is composed of two major isomers: all-trans β-carotene, the common natural form of this pigment, and 9-cis β-carotene. The biosynthetic pathway of β-carotene is known, but it is not clear how the 9-cis isomer is formed. We identified in plastidic lipid globules that were isolated from D. bardawil two proteins with high sequence homology to the D27 protein-a 9-cis/all-trans β-carotene isomerase from rice (Alder et al. Science 335:1348-1351, 2012). The proteins are enriched in the oil globules by 6- to 17-fold compared to chloroplast proteins. The expression of the corresponding genes, 9-cis-βC-iso1 and 9-cis-βC-iso2, is enhanced under light stress. The synthetic proteins catalyze in vitro conversion of all-trans to 9-cis β-carotene. Expression of the 9-cis-βC-iso1 or of 9-cis-βC-iso2 genes in an E. coli mutant line that harbors β-carotene biosynthesis genes enhanced the conversion of all-trans into 9-cis β-carotene. These results suggest that 9-cis-βC-ISO1 and 9-cis-βC-ISO2 proteins are responsible for the formation of 9-cis β-carotene in D. bardawil under stress conditions.
28335375	Assessing the Spectral Properties of Sunlit and Shaded Components in Rice Canopies with Near-Ground Imaging Spectroscopy Data.	2017	Sensors (Basel)	Monitoring the components of crop canopies with remote sensing can help us understand the within-canopy variation in spectral properties and resolve the sources of uncertainties in the spectroscopic estimation of crop foliar chemistry. To date, the spectral properties of leaves and panicles in crop canopies and the shadow effects on their spectral variation remain poorly understood due to the insufficient spatial resolution of traditional spectroscopy data. To address this issue, we used a near-ground imaging spectroscopy system with high spatial and spectral resolutions to examine the spectral properties of rice leaves and panicles in sunlit and shaded portions of canopies and evaluate the effect of shadows on the relationships between spectral indices of leaves and foliar chlorophyll content. The results demonstrated that the shaded components exhibited lower reflectance amplitude but stronger absorption features than their sunlit counterparts. Specifically, the reflectance spectra of panicles had unique double-peak absorption features in the blue region. Among the examined vegetation indices (VIs), significant differences were found in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) between leaves and panicles and further differences in the transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI) between sunlit and shaded components. After an image-level separation of canopy components with these two indices, statistical analyses revealed much higher correlations between canopy chlorophyll content and both PRI and TCARI of shaded leaves than for those of sunlit leaves. In contrast, the red edge chlorophyll index (CIRed-edge) exhibited the strongest correlations with canopy chlorophyll content among all vegetation indices examined regardless of shadows on leaves. These findings represent significant advances in the understanding of rice leaf and panicle spectral properties under natural light conditions and demonstrate the significance of commonly overlooked shaded leaves in the canopy when correlated to canopy chlorophyll content.
28334204	Transcriptomic and histological responses of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) to Meloidogyne graminicola provide new insights into root-knot nematode resistance in monocots.	2017	Ann Bot	Background and Aims: The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola is responsible for production losses in rice ( Oryza sativa ) in Asia and Latin America. The accession TOG5681 of African rice, O. glaberrima , presents improved resistance to several biotic and abiotic factors, including nematodes. The aim of this study was to assess the cytological and molecular mechanisms underlying nematode resistance in this accession.

Methods: Penetration and development in M. graminicola in TOG5681 and the susceptible O. sativa genotype 'Nipponbare' were compared by microscopic observation of infected roots and histological analysis of galls. In parallel, host molecular responses to M. graminicola were assessed by root transcriptome profiling at 2, 4 and 8 d post-infection (dpi). Specific treatments with hormone inhibitors were conducted in TOG5681 to assess the impact of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways on nematode penetration and reproduction.

Key Results: Penetration and development of M. graminicola juveniles were reduced in the resistant TOG5681 in comparison with the susceptible accession, with degeneration of giant cells observed in the resistant genotype from 15 dpi onwards. Transcriptome changes were observed as early as 2 dpi, with genes predicted to be involved in defence responses, phenylpropanoid and hormone pathways strongly induced in TOG5681, in contrast to 'Nipponbare'. No specific hormonal pathway could be identified as the major determinant of resistance in the rice-nematode incompatible interaction. Candidate genes proposed as involved in resistance to M. graminicola in TOG5681 were identified based on their expression pattern and quantitative trait locus (QTL) position, including chalcone synthase, isoflavone reductase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, WRKY62 transcription factor, thionin, stripe rust resistance protein, thaumatins and ATPase3.

Conclusions: This study provides a novel set of candidate genes for O. glaberrima resistance to nematodes and highlights the rice- M. graminicola pathosystem as a model to study plant-nematode incompatible interactions.
28270549	Papers of note in <i>Science</i><b>355</b> (6328).	2017	Sci Signal	This week's articles highlight immune receptors that protect rice from a fungal pathogen without reducing crop yield, an engineered opioid receptor agonist that relieves pain without side effects, structural analysis of a voltage-gated sodium channel, and the biophysics of bacteriorhodopsin folding.
28369958	Isolation and characterization of rice cesium transporter genes from a rice-transporter-enriched yeast expression library.	2017	Physiol Plant	A considerable portion of agricultural land in central-east Japan has been contaminated by radioactive material, particularly radioactive Cs, due to the industrial accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Understanding the mechanism of absorption, translocation and accumulation of Cs+ in plants will greatly assist in developing approaches to help reduce the radioactive contamination of agricultural products. At present, however, little is known regarding the Cs+ transporters in rice. A transporter-enriched yeast expression library was constructed and the library was screened for Cs+ transporter genes. The 1452 full length cDNAs encoding transporter genes were obtained from the Rice Genome Resource Center and 1358 clones of these transporter genes were successively subcloned into yeast expression vectors; which were then transferred into yeast. Using this library, both positive and negative selection screens can be performed, which have not been previously possible. The constructed library is an excellent tool for the isolation of novel transporter genes. This library was screened for clones that were sensitive to Cs+ using a SD-Gal medium containing either 30 or 70 mM CsCl; resulting in the isolation of 13 Cs+ sensitive clones. 137 Cs absorption experiments were conducted and confirmed that all of the identified clones were able to absorb 137 Cs. A total of 3 potassium transporters, 2 ABC transporters and 1 NRAMP transporter were among the 13 identified clones.
28303353	Silicon alleviates simulated acid rain stress of Oryza sativa L. seedlings by adjusting physiology activity and mineral nutrients.	2017	Protoplasma	Silicon (Si) has been a modulator in plants under abiotic stresses, such as acid rain. To understand how silicon made an effect on rice (Oryza sativa L.) exposed to simulated acid rain (SAR) stress, the growth, physiologic activity, and mineral nutrient content in leaves of rice were investigated. The results showed that combined treatments with Si (1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mM) and SAR (pH 4.0, 3.0, or 2.0) obviously improved the rice growth compared with the single treatment with SAR. Incorporation of Si into SAR treatment decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content; increased soluble protein and proline contents; promoted CAT, POD, SOD, and APX activity; and maintained the K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu content balance in leaves of rice seedlings under SAR stress. The moderate concentration of Si (2.0 mM) was better than the low and high concentration of Si (1.0 and 4.0 mM). Therefore, application of Si could be a better strategy for maintaining the crop productivity in acid rain regions.
28151037	Differential deposition of H2A.Z in rice seedling tissue during the day-night cycle.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Chromatin structure has an important role in modulating gene expression. The incorporation of histone variants into the nucleosome leads to important changes in the chromatin structure. The histone variant H2A.Z is highly conserved between different species of fungi, animals, and plants. However, dynamic changes to H2A.Z in rice have not been reported during the day-night cycle. In this study, we generated genome wide maps of H2A.Z for day and night time in harvested seedling tissues by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing. The analysis results for the H2A.Z data sets detected 7099 genes with higher depositions of H2A.Z in seedling tissues harvested at night compared with seedling tissues harvested during the day, whereas 4597 genes had higher H2A.Z depositions in seedlings harvested during the day. The gene expression profiles data suggested that H2A.Z probably negatively regulated gene expression during the day-night cycle and was involved in many important biologic processes. In general, our results indicated that H2A.Z may play an important role in plant responses to the diurnal oscillation process.
28108552	Predicted Residual Error Sum of Squares of Mixed Models: An Application for Genomic Prediction.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Genomic prediction is a statistical method to predict phenotypes of polygenic traits using high-throughput genomic data. Most diseases and behaviors in humans and animals are polygenic traits. The majority of agronomic traits in crops are also polygenic. Accurate prediction of these traits can help medical professionals diagnose acute diseases and breeders to increase food products, and therefore significantly contribute to human health and global food security. The best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is an important tool to analyze high-throughput genomic data for prediction. However, to judge the efficacy of the BLUP model with a particular set of predictors for a given trait, one has to provide an unbiased mechanism to evaluate the predictability. Cross-validation (CV) is an essential tool to achieve this goal, where a sample is partitioned into K parts of roughly equal size, one part is predicted using parameters estimated from the remaining K - 1 parts, and eventually every part is predicted using a sample excluding that part. Such a CV is called the K-fold CV. Unfortunately, CV presents a substantial increase in computational burden. We developed an alternative method, the HAT method, to replace CV. The new method corrects the estimated residual errors from the whole sample analysis using the leverage values of a hat matrix of the random effects to achieve the predicted residual errors. Properties of the HAT method were investigated using seven agronomic and 1000 metabolomic traits of an inbred rice population. Results showed that the HAT method is a very good approximation of the CV method. The method was also applied to 10 traits in 1495 hybrid rice with 1.6 million SNPs, and to human height of 6161 subjects with roughly 0.5 million SNPs of the Framingham heart study data. Predictabilities of the HAT and CV methods were all similar. The HAT method allows us to easily evaluate the predictabilities of genomic prediction for large numbers of traits in very large populations.
28391850	Increasing the efficiency of immobilization and chitin determination using copper oxide nanoparticles.	2017	Talanta	A novel polyurethane (PU) support with and without copper oxide nanoparticles (nCuO) was employed for immobilization of two chitinolytic enzymes, chitinase and N-acetyl β glucosaminidase (NAGase) to yield PU/nCuO/chitinase/NAGase and PU/chitinase/NAGase conjugates respectively. The surface morphologies, topologies and bonded interactions between different components of the immobilized enzyme conjugates were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. High conjugation yield of 0.811±0.10mg/cm2 with 97.66±0.50% retention of specific activity of enzymes on PU/nCuO support vis-a-vis a conjugation yield of 0.531±0.50mg/cm2 with 75.23±0.60% retention activity on PU support was achieved. Additionally, increased pH and temperature tolerance, better kinetic parameters and enhanced stabilities of PU/nCuO/chitinase/NAGase conjugates established their superiority over the PU/chitinase/NAGase conjugates. However, both the conjugates were successfully employed for the determination of chitin contents in the apparently healthy stored rice grains. The methods were tested on analytical parameters such as linearity, limit of detection, the coefficient of variation and reproducibility of the externally added chitin, which were again found to be superior for PU/nCuO/chitinase/NAGase conjugates.
28369468	Patterns of stress response and tolerance based on transcriptome profiling of rice crown tissue under zinc deficiency.	2017	J Exp Bot	Zinc (Zn) deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient disorder in rice and leads to delayed development and decreased yield. Several studies have investigated how rice plants respond to Zn deficiency and examined the differences between Zn-efficient (ZE) and Zn-inefficient (ZI) genotypes. ZE genotypes reallocate more Zn to roots and are better at maintaining crown root development than ZI genotypes in response to Zn deficiency. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling these differences. Moreover, the role of the crown, the part of the stem from which crown roots emerge, has yet to be examined. In this study we highlight the molecular mechanisms triggered by early Zn deficiency in crown tissue through RNA sequencing of two contrasting groups of several ZE and ZI genotypes. This method allowed us to (i) identify several novel and well-known Zn transporters involved in Zn retranslocation from the crown to the shoot and roots in response to Zn deficiency; (ii) determine that Zn deficiency triggers the conversion of soluble sugars into starch; and (iii) detect several candidate genes possibly conferring Zn efficiency, including a monosaccharide transporter, a Zn finger domain-containing protein, a gibberellin-stimulated family protein and a plasma membrane polypeptide family protein.
28366824	Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	The utilization of natural genetic variation greatly contributes to improvement of important agronomic traits in crops. Understanding the genetic basis for natural variation of grain size can help breeders develop high-yield rice varieties. In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized gene, named GSE5, in the qSW5/GW5 locus controlling rice grain size by combining the genome-wide association study with functional analyses. GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains, which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1. We found that loss of GSE5 function caused wide and heavy grains, while overexpression of GSE5 resulted in narrow grains. We showed that GSE5 regulates grain size predominantly by influencing cell proliferation in spikelet hulls. Three major haplotypes of GSE5 (GSE5, GSE5DEL1+IN1, and GSE5DEL2) in cultivated rice were identified based on the deletion/insertion type in its promoter region. We demonstrated that a 950-bp deletion (DEL1) in indica varieties carrying the GSE5DEL1+IN1 haplotype and a 1212-bp deletion (DEL2) in japonica varieties carrying the GSE5DEL2 haplotype associated with decreased expression of GSE5, resulting in wide grains. Further analyses indicate that wild rice accessions contain all three haplotypes of GSE5, suggesting that the GSE5 haplotypes present in cultivated rice are likely to have originated from different wild rice accessions during rice domestication. Taken together, our results indicate that the previously unrecognized GSE5 gene in the qSW5/GW5 locus, which is widely utilized by rice breeders, controls grain size, and reveal that natural variation in the promoter region of GSE5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice.
28167026	Drought-tolerant QTL qVDT11 leads to stable tiller formation under drought stress conditions in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	Drought is an important limiting factor for rice production, but the genetic mechanisms of drought tolerance is poorly understood. Here, we screened 218 rice varieties to identify 32 drought-tolerant varieties. The variety Samgang exhibited strong drought tolerance and stable yield in rain-fed conditions and was selected for further study. To identify QTLs for drought tolerance, we examined visual drought tolerance (VDT) and relative water content (RWC) phenotypes in a doubled haploid (DH) population of 101 individuals derived from a cross between Samgang and Nagdong (a drought-sensitive variety). Three QTLs from Samgang were identified for VDT and explained 41.8% of the phenotypic variance. In particular, qVDT11 contributed 20.3% of the phenotypic variance for RWC. To determine QTL effects on drought tolerance in rain-fed paddy conditions, seven DH lines were selected according to the number of QTLs they contained. Of the drought-tolerance-associated QTLs, qVDT2 and qVDT6 did not affect tiller formation, but qVDT11 increased tiller number. Tiller formation was most stable when qVDT2 and qVDT11 were combined. DH lines with both of these drought-tolerance-associated QTLs exhibited the most stable tiller formation. Together, these results suggest that qVDT11 is important for drought tolerance and stable tiller formation in rain-fed paddy fields.
28337762	Molecular interaction between PHO2 and GIGANTEA reveals a new crosstalk between flowering time and phosphate homeostasis in Oryza sativa.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Plants are often confronted to nutrient limiting conditions, such as inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency, resulting in a reduction in growth and yield. PHO2, encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, is a central component of the Pi-starvation response signalling pathway. A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Oryza sativa (rice) PHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGIGANTEA, a key regulator of flowering time, which was confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Characterization of rice Osgi and Ospho2 mutants revealed that they displayed several similar phenotypic features supporting a physiological role for this interaction. Reduced growth, leaf tip necrosis, delayed flowering and over-accumulation of Pi in leaves compared to wild type were shared features of Osgi and Ospho2 plants. Pi analysis of individual leaves demonstrated that Osgi, similar to Ospho2 mutants, were impaired in Pi remobilization from old to young leaves, albeit to a lesser extent. Transcriptome analyses revealed more than 55% of the genes differentially expressed in Osgi plants overlapped with the set of differentially expressed genes in Ospho2 plants. The interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGI links high-level regulators of Pi homeostasis and development in rice.
28274717	RNA interference knockdown of aminopeptidase N genes decrease the susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis larvae to Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca-expressing transgenic rice.	2017	J Invertebr Pathol	Transgenic rice expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins are resistant to lepidopteran pests, such as Chilo suppressalis, a major insect pest of rice in Asia. Understanding how these toxins interact with their hosts is crucial to understanding their insecticidal action. In this study, knockdown of two aminopeptidase N genes (APN1 and APN2) by RNA interference resulted in decreased susceptibility of C. suppressalis larvae to the Bt rice varieties TT51 (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac fusion genes) and T1C-19 (Cry1Ca), but not T2A-1 (Cry2Aa). This suggests that APN1 and APN2 are receptors for Cry1A and Cry1C toxins in C. suppressalis.
28299429	Anther-preferential expressing gene PMR is essential for the mitosis of pollen development in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Phenotype identification, expression examination, and function prediction declared that the anther-preferential expressing gene PMR may participate in regulation of male gametophyte development in rice. Male germline development in flowering plants produces the pair of sperm cells for double fertilization and the pollen mitosis is a key process of it. Although the structural features of male gametophyte have been defined, the molecular mechanisms regulating the mitotic cell cycle are not well elucidated in rice. Here, we reported an anther-preferential expressing gene in rice, PMR (Pollen Mitosis Relative), playing an essential role in male gametogenesis. When PMR gene was suppressed via RNAi, the mitosis of microspore was severely damaged, and the plants formed unmatured pollens containing only one or two nucleuses at the anthesis, ultimately leading to serious reduction of pollen fertility and seed-setting. The CRISPR mutants, pmr-1 and pmr-2, both showed the similar defects as the PMR-RNAi lines. Further analysis revealed that PMR together with its co-expressing genes were liable to participate in the regulation of DNA metabolism in the nucleus, and affected the activities of some enzymes related to the cell cycle. We finally discussed that unknown protein PMR contained the PHD, SWIB and Plus-3 domains and they might have coordinating functions in regulation pathway of the pollen mitosis in rice.
28317902	A natural tandem array alleviates epigenetic repression of IPA1 and leads to superior yielding rice.	2017	Nat Commun	Super hybrid rice varieties with ideal plant architecture (IPA) have been critical in enhancing food security worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their improved yield remain unclear. Here, we report the identification of a QTL, qWS8/ipa1-2D, in the super rice Yongyou12 (YY12) and related varieties. In-depth genetic molecular characterization of qWS8/ipa1-2D reveals that this newly identified QTL results from three distal naturally occurring tandem repeats upstream of IPA1, a key gene/locus previously shown to shape rice ideal plant architecture and greatly enhance grain yield. The qWS8/ipa1-2D locus is associated with reduced DNA methylation and a more open chromatin state at the IPA1 promoter, thus alleviating the epigenetic repression of IPA1 mediated by nearby heterochromatin. Our findings reveal that IPA traits can be fine-tuned by manipulating IPA1 expression and that an optimal IPA1 expression/dose may lead to an ideal yield, demonstrating a practical approach to efficiently design elite super rice varieties.
28290557	Ectopic expression of Arabidopsis FD and FD PARALOGUE in rice results in dwarfism with size reduction of spikelets.	2017	Sci Rep	Key flowering genes, FD and FD PARALOGUE (FDP) encoding bZIP transcription factors that interact with a FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis were ectopically expressed in rice since we found AtFD and AtFDP also interact with HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1). Transgenic rice plants overexpressing AtFD and AtFDP caused reduction in plant height and spikelet size with decreased expression of genes involved in cell elongation without significant flowering time alteration in spite of increased expression of OsMADS14 and OsMADS15, rice homologues of APETALA1 (AP1) in the leaves. Simultaneous overexpression of AtFD and AtFDP enhanced phenotypes seen with overexpression of either single gene while transgenic rice plants expressing AtFD or AtFDP under the control of phloem-specific Hd3a promoter were indistinguishable from wild-type rice. Candidate genes responsible for the phenotypes were identified by comparison of microarray hybridization and their expression pattern was also examined in WT and transgenic rice plants. It has so far not been reported that AtFD and AtFDP affect cell elongation in plants, and our findings provide novel insight into the possible roles of AtFD and AtFDP in the mesophyll cells of plants, and potential genetic tools for manipulation of crop architecture.
28415033	Physiological investigation of C<sub>4</sub>-phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxylase-introduced rice line shows that sucrose metabolism is involved in the improved drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	We compared the drought tolerance of wild-type (WT) and transgenic rice plants (PC) over-expressing the maize C4PEPC gene, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) gene, and evaluated the roles of saccharide and sugar-related enzymes in the drought response. Pot-grown seedlings were subjected to real drought conditions outdoors, and the yield components were compared between PC and untransformed wild-type (WT) plants. The stable yield from PC plants was associated with higher net photosynthetic rate under the real drought treatment. The physiological characters of WT and PC seedlings under a simulated drought treatment (25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-6000 for 3 h; PEG 6000 treatment) were analyzed in detail for the early response of drought. The relative water content was higher in PC than in WT, and PEPC activity and the C4-PEPC transcript level in PC were elevated under the simulated drought conditions. The endogenous saccharide responses also differed between PC and WT under simulated drought stress. The higher sugar decomposition rate in PC than in WT under drought analog stress was related to the increased activities of sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, acid invertase, and neutral invertase, increased transcript levels of VIN1, CIN1, NIN1, SUT2, SUT4, and SUT5, and increased activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase in the leaves. The greater antioxidant defense capacity of PC and its relationship with saccharide metabolism was one of the reasons for the improved drought tolerance. In conclusion, PEPC effectively alleviated oxidative damage and enhanced the drought tolerance in rice plants, which were more related to the increase of the endogenous saccharide decomposition. These findings show that components of C4 photosynthesis can be used to increase the yield of rice under drought conditions.
28332574	Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.	2017	Nat Commun	Low temperature is a major factor limiting rice productivity and geographical distribution. Improved cold tolerance and expanded cultivation to high-altitude or high-latitude regions would help meet growing rice demand. Here we explored a QTL for cold tolerance and cloned the gene, CTB4a (cold tolerance at booting stage), encoding a conserved leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase. We show that different CTB4a alleles confer distinct levels of cold tolerance and selection for variation in the CTB4a promoter region has occurred on the basis of environmental temperature. The newly generated cold-tolerant haplotype Tej-Hap-KMXBG was retained by artificial selection during temperate japonica evolution in cold habitats for low-temperature acclimation. Moreover, CTB4a interacts with AtpB, a beta subunit of ATP synthase. Upregulation of CTB4a correlates with increased ATP synthase activity, ATP content, enhanced seed setting and improved yield under cold stress conditions. These findings suggest strategies to improve cold tolerance in crop plants.
28295376	Both maternally and paternally imprinted genes regulate seed development in rice.	2017	New Phytol	Genetic imprinting refers to the unequal expression of paternal and maternal alleles of a gene in sexually reproducing organisms, including mammals and flowering plants. Although many imprinted genes have been identified in plants, the functions of these imprinted genes have remained largely uninvestigated. We report genome-wide analysis of gene expression, DNA methylation and small RNAs in the rice endosperm and functional tests of five imprinted genes during seed development using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated gene9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene editing technology. In the rice endosperm, we identified 162 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 95 paternally expressed genes (PEGs), which were associated with miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, imprinted differentially methylated loci and some 21-22 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Remarkably, one-third of MEGs and nearly one-half of PEGs were associated with grain yield quantitative trait loci. Most MEGs and some PEGs were expressed specifically in the endosperm. Disruption of two MEGs increased the amount of small starch granules and reduced grain and embryo size, whereas mutation of three PEGs reduced starch content and seed fertility. Our data indicate that both MEGs and PEGs in rice regulate nutrient metabolism and endosperm development, which optimize seed development and offspring fitness to facilitate parental-offspring coadaptation. These imprinted genes and mechanisms could be used to improve the grain yield of rice and other cereal crops.
28351912	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	2017	Plant Physiol	Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of OSH15 showed reduced seed-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the OSH15 promoter-GUS reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that OSH15 messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of osh15 SH5-D double mutants showed that SH5 could not increase the degree of seed shattering when OSH15 was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed-shattering phenotype, osh15 mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of CAD2, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy seed-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice (Oryza sativa). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with CAD2 chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.

28347275	Exploring structural variation and gene family architecture with De Novo assemblies of 15 Medicago genomes.	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Previous studies exploring sequence variation in the model legume, Medicago truncatula, relied on mapping short reads to a single reference. However, read-mapping approaches are inadequate to examine large, diverse gene families or to probe variation in repeat-rich or highly divergent genome regions. De novo sequencing and assembly of M. truncatula genomes enables near-comprehensive discovery of structural variants (SVs), analysis of rapidly evolving gene families, and ultimately, construction of a pan-genome.

RESULTS: Genome-wide synteny based on 15 de novo M. truncatula assemblies effectively detected different types of SVs indicating that as much as 22% of the genome is involved in large structural changes, altogether affecting 28% of gene models. A total of 63 million base pairs (Mbp) of novel sequence was discovered, expanding the reference genome space for Medicago by 16%. Pan-genome analysis revealed that 42% (180 Mbp) of genomic sequences is missing in one or more accession, while examination of de novo annotated genes identified 67% (50,700) of all ortholog groups as dispensable - estimates comparable to recent studies in rice, maize and soybean. Rapidly evolving gene families typically associated with biotic interactions and stress response were found to be enriched in the accession-specific gene pool. The nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family, in particular, harbors the highest level of nucleotide diversity, large effect single nucleotide change, protein diversity, and presence/absence variation. However, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and heat shock gene families are disproportionately affected by large effect single nucleotide changes and even higher levels of copy number variation.

CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of multiple M. truncatula genomes illustrates the value of de novo assemblies to discover and describe structural variation, something that is often under-estimated when using read-mapping approaches. Comparisons among the de novo assemblies also indicate that different large gene families differ in the architecture of their structural variation.
28319055	Rational design of high-yield and superior-quality rice.	2017	Nat Plants	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half of the world's population. To meet the ever-increasing demand for food, because of population growth and improved living standards, world rice production needs to double by 20301. The development of new elite rice varieties with high yield and superior quality is challenging for traditional breeding approaches, and new strategies need to be developed. Here, we report the successful development of new elite varieties by pyramiding major genes that significantly contribute to grain quality and yield from three parents over five years. The new varieties exhibit higher yield potential and better grain quality than their parental varieties and the China's leading super-hybrid rice, Liang-you-pai-jiu (LYP9 or Pei-ai 64S/93-11). Our results demonstrate that rational design is a powerful strategy for meeting the challenges of future crop breeding, particularly in pyramiding multiple complex traits.
28257051	Functional Analysis of a Wheat AGPase Plastidial Small Subunit with a Truncated Transit Peptide.	2017	Molecules	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the key enzyme in starch synthesis, consists of two small subunits and two large subunits with cytosolic and plastidial isoforms. In our previous study, a cDNA sequence encoding the plastidial small subunit (TaAGPS1b) of AGPase in grains of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was isolated and the protein subunit encoded by this gene was characterized as a truncated transit peptide (about 50% shorter than those of other plant AGPS1bs). In the present study, TaAGPS1b was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in rice protoplast cells, and confocal fluorescence microscopy observations revealed that like other AGPS1b containing the normal transit peptide, TaAGPS1b-GFP was localized in chloroplasts. TaAGPS1b was further overexpressed in a Chinese bread wheat cultivar, and the transgenic wheat lines exhibited a significant increase in endosperm AGPase activities, starch contents, and grain weights. These suggested that TaAGPS1b subunit was targeted into plastids by its truncated transit peptide and it could play an important role in starch synthesis in bread wheat grains.
28464063	The Plant Orthology Browser: An Orthology and Gene-Order Visualizer for Plant Comparative Genomics.	2017	Plant Genome	Worldwide genome sequencing efforts for plants with medium and large genomes require identification and visualization of orthologous genes, while their syntenic conservation becomes the pinnacle of any comparative and functional genomics study. Using gene models for 20 fully sequenced plant genomes, including model organisms and staple crops such as Coss., (L.) Heynh., (L.) Beauv., turnip ( L.), barley ( L.), rice ( L.), sorghum [ (L.) Moench], wheat ( L.), red wild einkorn ( Tumanian ex Gandilyan), and maize ( L.), we computationally predicted 1,021,611 orthologs using stringent sequence similarity criteria. For each pair of plant species, we determined sets of conserved synteny blocks using strand orientation and physical mapping. Gene ontology (GO) annotations are added for each gene. Plant Orthology Browser (POB) includes three interconnected modules: (i) a gene-order visualization module implementing an interactive environment for exploration of gene order between any pair of chromosomes in two plant species, (ii) a synteny visualization module providing unique interactive dot plot representations of orthologous genes between a pair of chromosomes in two distinct plant species, and (iii) a search module that interconnects all modules via free-text search capability with online as-you-type suggestions and highlighting that allows exploration of the underlining information without constraint of interface-dependent search fields. The POB is a web-based orthology and annotation visualization tool, which currently supports 20 completely sequenced plant species with considerably large genomes and offers intuitive and highly interactive pairwise comparison and visualization of genomic traits via gene orthology.
28256530	Translational repression by a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 3' untranslated region.	2017	Nat Commun	Transposable elements constitute a substantial portion of eukaryotic genomes and contribute to genomic variation, function, and evolution. Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), as DNA transposons, are widely distributed in plant and animal genomes. Previous studies have suggested that retrotransposons act as translational regulators; however, it remains unknown how host mRNAs are influenced by DNA transposons. Here we report a translational repression mechanism mediated by a stowaway-like MITE (sMITE) embedded in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Ghd2, a member of the CCT (CONSTANS [CO], CO-LIKE and TIMING OF CAB1) gene family in rice. Ghd2 regulates important agronomic traits, including grain number, plant height and heading date. Interestingly, the translational repression of Ghd2 by the sMITE mainly relies on Dicer-like 3a (OsDCL3a). Furthermore, other MITEs in the 3'-UTRs of different rice genes exhibit a similar effect on translational repression, thus suggesting that MITEs may exert a general regulatory function at the translational level.
28483054	A novel class I Chitinase from Hippophae rhamnoides: Indications for participating in ICE-CBF cold stress signaling pathway.	2017	Plant Sci	Plant chitinases are the members of PR (Pathogenesis related) proteins family and protect plants from biotic and abiotic stress. A novel chitinase HrCHI1 (Accession number JQ289153) of 954bp ORF encoding 317 amino acids protein was cloned, expressed and characterized from seabuckthorn, a cold/freeze tolerant shrub. The 3D structure (predicted with I-TASSER server) showed highest homology with Oryza sativa class I chitinase (PDB 2dkvA). Putative promoter region (obtained by genome walking) showed GCC box, E-boxes, the binding site for bHLH proteins and DRE elements, the CBF (C-repeat binding factor) binding site besides TATA and CAAT boxes. The gel shift assay with the nuclear extract indicated that the HrCHI1 might be participating in CBF/ERF dependent cold stress signaling pathway. The quantitative transcript profiling supported this observation as cold induced expression of HrCBF peaked earlier (at 1h) while HrCHI1 peaked latter (after 3h) indicating HrCHI1 expression might be induced by HrCBF. Further, HrCHI1 expression was methyl jasmonate (MeJa) dependent and salicylic acid (SA) independent. HrCHI1 was expressed in E. coli and purified using chitin affinity chromatography. It showed 512U/mg chitinase hydrolytic activity and resolved as a 34kDa spot with a slightly basic pI (8.5) on a 2-D gel. The E. coli cells containing recombinant chitinase showed higher rate of growth in cold in comparison with the cells containing the empty vector. In conclusion, we have isolated and characterized a cold responsive basic class I chitinase which is regulated by MeJa and seems to be functioning via CBF/ERF dependent cold stress signaling pathway.
28167036	Newly identified CSP41b gene localized in chloroplasts affects leaf color in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	A rice mutant with light-green leaves was discovered from a transgenic line of Oryza sativa. The mutant has reduced chlorophyll content and abnormal chloroplast morphology throughout its life cycle. Genetic analysis revealed that a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene is responsible for the mutation, here designated as lgl1. To isolate the lgl1 gene, a high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the lgl1 gene was made using a mapping population consisting of 1984 mutant individuals. The lgl1 gene was mapped in the 76.5kb region between marker YG4 and marker YG5 on chromosome 12. Sequence analysis revealed that there was a 39bp deletion within the fourth exon of the candidate gene Os12g0420200 (TIGR locus Os12g23180) encoding a chloroplast stem-loop-binding protein of 41kDa b (CSP41b). The lgl1 mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild type CSP41b gene. Accordingly, the CSP41b gene is identified as the LGL1 gene. CSP41b was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in leaves. Expression of CSP41b-GFP fusion protein indicated that CSP41b is localized in chloroplasts. The expression levels of some key genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis, such as ChlD, ChlI, Hema1, Ygl1, POR, Cab1R, Cab2R, PsaA, and rbcL, was significantly changed in the lgl1 mutant. Our results demonstrate that CSP41b is a novel gene required for normal leaf color and chloroplast morphology in rice.
28331197	Efficient Generation of diRNAs Requires Components in the Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing Pathway.	2017	Sci Rep	It has been reported that double-stranded break (DSB)-induced small RNAs (diRNAs) are generated via the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway and function in DSB repair in Arabidposis. However, important questions remain regarding the biogenesis and function of diRNAs. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9- or TALEN-triggered DSBs to characterize diRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice. We found that 21-nt diRNAs were generated from a 35S promoter::GU-US reporter transgene targeted by CRISPR/Cas9. Unexpectedly, Pol II transcription of the transgene was required for efficient diRNA production and the level of diRNA accumulation correlated with the expression level of the transgene. diRNAs were not detected from CRISPR/Cas9- or TALEN-induced DSBs within the examined endogenous genes in Arabidopsis or rice. We also found that DCL4 and RDR6 that are known to be involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing were required to generate diRNAs. Our results suggest that DSBs are necessary but not sufficient for efficient diRNA generation and a high level of diRNAs is not necessary for DSB repair.

28264034	Overexpression of the WOX gene STENOFOLIA improves biomass yield and sugar release in transgenic grasses and display altered cytokinin homeostasis.	2017	PLoS Genet	Lignocellulosic biomass can be a significant source of renewable clean energy with continued improvement in biomass yield and bioconversion strategies. In higher plants, the leaf blade is the central energy convertor where solar energy and CO2 are assimilated to make the building blocks for biomass production. Here we report that introducing the leaf blade development regulator STENOFOLIA (STF), a WOX family transcription factor, into the biofuel crop switchgrass, significantly improves both biomass yield and sugar release. We found that STF overexpressing switchgrass plants produced approximately 2-fold more dry biomass and release approximately 1.8-fold more solubilized sugars without pretreatment compared to controls. The biomass increase was attributed mainly to increased leaf width and stem thickness, which was also consistent in STF transgenic rice and Brachypodium, and appeared to be caused by enhanced cell proliferation. STF directly binds to multiple regions in the promoters of some cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) genes and represses their expression in all three transgenic grasses. This repression was accompanied by a significant increase in active cytokinin content in transgenic rice leaves, suggesting that the increase in biomass productivity and sugar release could at least in part be associated with improved cytokinin levels caused by repression of cytokinin degrading enzymes. Our study provides a new tool for improving biomass feedstock yield in bioenergy crops, and uncovers a novel mechanistic insight in the function of STF, which may also apply to other repressive WOX genes that are master regulators of several key plant developmental programs.

28278353	Bt rice in China - focusing the nontarget risk assessment.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Bt rice can control yield losses caused by lepidopteran pests but may also harm nontarget species and reduce important ecosystem services. A comprehensive data set on herbivores, natural enemies, and their interactions in Chinese rice fields was compiled. This together with an analysis of the Cry protein content in arthropods collected from Bt rice in China indicated which nontarget species are most exposed to the insecticidal protein and should be the focus of regulatory risk assessment.
28262736	Knockdown of the MAPK p38 pathway increases the susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis larvae to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ca toxin.	2017	Sci Rep	The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a wide range of toxins that are effective against a number of insect pests. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for resistance to Bt toxin will improve both our ability to control important insect pests and our understanding of bacterial toxicology. In this study, we investigated the role of MAPK pathways in resistance against Cry1Ca toxin in Chilo suppressalis, an important lepidopteran pest of rice crops. We first cloned the full-length of C. suppressalis mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, ERK1, and ERK2, and a partial sequence of JNK (hereafter Csp38, CsERK1, CsERK2 and CsJNK). We could then measure the up-regulation of these MAPK genes in larvae at different times after ingestion of Cry1Ca toxin. Using RNA interference to knockdown Csp38, CsJNK, CsERK1 and CsERK2 showed that only knockdown of Csp38 significantly increased the mortality of larvae to Cry1Ca toxin ingested in either an artificial diet, or after feeding on transgenic rice expressed Cry1Ca. These results suggest that MAPK p38 is responsible for the resistance of C. suppressalis larvae to Bt Cry1Ca toxin.
28483051	ES7, encoding a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase, functions in nitrogen metabolism and impacts leaf senescence in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) is a key enzyme for nitrogen metabolism and ammonium assimilation in plants. In this study, an early senescence 7 (es7) mutant was identified and characterized. The leaves of the es7 mutant begin to senesce at the tillering stage about 60day after sowing, and become increasingly senescent as the plants develop at the heading stage. When es7 plants are grown under photorespiration-suppressed conditions (high CO2), the senescence phenotype and chlorophyll content are rescued. qRT-PCR analysis showed that senescence- associated genes were up-regulated significantly in es7. A map-based cloning strategy was used to identify ES7, which encodes a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT). ES7 was expressed constitutively, and the ES7 protein was localized in chloroplast. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that several genes related to nitrogen metabolism were differentially expressed in es7. Further, we also demonstrated that chlorophyll synthesis-associated genes were significantly down-regulated in es7. In addition, when seedlings are grown under increasing nitrogen concentrations (NH4NO3) for 15days, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in es7. Our results demonstrated that ES7 is involved in nitrogen metabolism, effects chlorophyll synthesis, and may also associated with photorespiration, impacting leaf senescence in rice.
28262713	bHLH142 regulates various metabolic pathway-related genes to affect pollen development and anther dehiscence in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Apposite development of anther and its dehiscence are important for the reproductive success of the flowering plants. Recently, bHLH142, a bHLH transcription factor encoding gene of rice has been found to show anther-specific expression and mutant analyses suggest its functions in regulating tapetum differentiation and degeneration during anther development. However, our study on protein level expression and gain-of-function phenotype revealed novel aspects of its regulation and function during anther development. Temporally dissimilar pattern of bHLH142 transcript and polypeptide accumulation suggested regulation of its expression beyond transcriptional level. Overexpression of bHLH142 in transgenic rice resulted in indehiscent anthers and aborted pollen grains. Defects in septum and stomium rupture caused anther indehiscence while pollen abortion phenotype attributed to abnormal degeneration of the tapetum. Furthermore, RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis of tetrad and mature pollen stage anthers of wild type and bHLH142OEplants suggested that it might regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell wall modification, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and cell death-related genes during rice anther development. Thus, bHLH142 is an anther-specific gene whose expression is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional/translational levels. It plays a role in pollen maturation and anther dehiscence by regulating expression of various metabolic pathways-related genes.
28447047	Replacement of threonine-55 with glycine decreases the reduction rate of OsTrx20 by glutathione.	2017	Mol Biol Res Commun	Thioredoxins (Trxs) are small ubiquitous oxidoreductase proteins with two redox-active Cys residues in a conserved active site (WCG/PPC) that regulate numerous target proteins via thiol/disulﬁde exchanges in the cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The isoforms OsTrx23 with a typical active site (WCGPC) and OsTrx20 with an atypical active site (WCTPC) are two Trx h- type isoforms in rice that were previously found to be reduced by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase and GSH/Grx system, respectively. In the present work the reduction of mutants G41TOsTrx23, T55GOsTrx20, K48DOsTrx20 and T55G-K48D OsTrx20 as well as wild types OsTrx23 and OsTrx20 were tested in the reaction containing either NADPH/NTR or glutathione (GSH). The results revealed that reduction rate of T55GOsTrx20 was remarkably decreased by GSH as compared to WtOsTrx20 highlighting the critical role of Thr-55 in interaction of OsTrx20 with GSH. On the other hand a significant decrease in the reduction rate of G41TOsTrx23 was observed in reaction containing NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase as compared with readuction rate of WtOsTrx23. These results suggest that first residue after N-terminal active site Cys is one of the critical residue in determination of system that Trxs can be reduced in.
28260782	Control of secondary cell wall patterning involves xylan deacetylation by a GDSL esterase.	2017	Nat Plants	O-acetylation, a ubiquitous modification of cell wall polymers, has striking impacts on plant growth and biomass utilization and needs to be tightly controlled. However, the mechanisms that underpin the control of cell wall acetylation remain elusive. Here, we show a rice brittle leaf sheath1 (bs1) mutant, which contains a lesion in a Golgi-localized GDSL esterase that deacetylates the prominent hemicellulose xylan. Cell wall composition, detailed xylan structure characterization and enzyme kinetics and activity assays on acetylated sugars and xylooligosaccharides demonstrate that BS1 is an esterase that cleaves acetyl moieties from the xylan backbone at O-2 and O-3 positions of xylopyranosyl residues. BS1 thus plays an important role in the maintenance of proper acetylation level on the xylan backbone, which is crucial for secondary wall formation and patterning. Our findings outline a mechanism for how plants modulate wall acetylation and endow a plethora of uncharacterized GDSL esterases with surmisable activities.
28349175	Characterization of the temporal and spatial expression of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plant height at the QTL level and their influence on yield-related traits.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: The temporal and spatial expression patterns of stable QTL for plant height and their influences on yield were characterized. Plant height (PH) is a complex trait in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that includes the spike length (SL) and the internode lengths from the first to the fifth internode, which are counted from the top and abbreviated as FIRITL, SECITL, THIITL, FOUITL, and FIFITL, respectively. This study identified eight putative additive quantitative trait loci (QTL) for PH. In addition, unconditional and conditional QTL mapping were used to analyze the temporal and spatial expression patterns of five stable QTL for PH. qPh-3A mainly regulated SL, FIRITL, and FIFITL to affect PH during the booting-heading stage (BS-HS); qPh-3D regulated all internode lengths to affect PH, especially during the BS-HS; before HS, qPh-4B mainly affected FIRITL, SECITL, THIITL, and FOUITL and qPh-5A.1 mainly affected SECITL, THIITL, and FOUITL to regulate PH; and qPh-6B mainly regulated FIRITL to affect the PH after the booting stage (BS). qPhdv-4B, a QTL for the response of PH to nitrogen stress, was stable and co-localized with qPh-4B. All five stable QTL, except for qPh-3A, were related to the 1000 kernel weight and yield per plant. Regions of qPh-3A, qPh-3D, qPh-4B, qPh-5A.1, and qPh-6B showed synteny to parts of rice chromosomes 1, 1, 3, 9, and 2, respectively. Based on comparative genomics analysis, Rht-B1b was cloned and mapped in the CI of qPh-4B. This report provides useful information for fine mapping of the stable QTL for PH and the genetic improvement of wheat plant type.
28343064	A barley homolog of yeast ATG6 is involved in multiple abiotic stress responses and stress resistance regulation.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation pathway among eukaryote cells, which can recycle damaged or unwanted cell materials upon encountering stress conditions. As a key component of the Class III PI3K kinase complex, ATG6/Beclin-1 is essential for autophagosome formation. In this study, we isolated a putative HvATG6 gene in barley genome. The protein encoded by HvATG6 shares high sequence identity to ATG6 orthologs in rice and wheat, and has a typical autophagy-specific domain containing segments of repeated β-sheet-α-helix. The expression of HvATG6 protein restored the appearance of autophagosomes in yeast atg6 mutant, indicating that HvATG6 complements the deficiency of yeast ATG6 protein in autophagy. Punctate florescence signals, considered as the PAS for autophagosome initiation, were observed in the cytoplasm of cells when HvATG6-GFP fusion construct was transformed into barley protoplast. Furthermore, the expression of HvATG6 was upregulated by various abiotic stresses including dark, H2O2 treatment, nitrogen deficiency, high salinity, drought, low temperature and toxic aluminum. Knockdown of HvATG6 in barley leaves through barley strip mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced gene silencing led to accelerated yellowing under dark and H2O2 treatments. Based on the above findings, we propose that barley ATG6 plays the similar role as other plant ATG6 orthologs, and might be involved in stress-induced autophagy process.
28368284	X-ray diffraction analysis and in vitro characterization of the UAM2 protein from Oryza sativa.	2017	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	The role of seemingly non-enzymatic proteins in complexes interconverting UDP-arabinopyranose and UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-arabinosemutases; UAMs) in the plant cytosol remains unknown. To shed light on their function, crystallographic and functional studies of the seemingly non-enzymatic UAM2 protein from Oryza sativa (OsUAM2) were undertaken. Here, X-ray diffraction data are reported, as well as analysis of the oligomeric state in the crystal and in solution. OsUAM2 crystallizes readily but forms highly radiation-sensitive crystals with limited diffraction power, requiring careful low-dose vector data acquisition. Using size-exclusion chromatography, it is shown that the protein is monomeric in solution. Finally, limited proteolysis was employed to demonstrate DTT-enhanced proteolytic digestion, indicating the existence of at least one intramolecular disulfide bridge or, alternatively, a requirement for a structural metal ion.
28292004	Transcription Factor <i>OsDOF18</i> Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	2017	Mol Cells	Nitrogen is one of the most important mineral elements for plant growth. We studied the functional roles of Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 18 (OsDOF18) in controlling ammonium uptake. The growth of null mutants of OsDOF18 was retarded in a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. In contrast, those mutants grew normally in a medium with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The gene expression was induced by ammonium but not by nitrate. Uptake of ammonium was lower in osdof18 mutants than in the wild type, while that of nitrate was not affected by the mutation. This indicated that OsDOF18 is involved in regulating ammonium transport. Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1, OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18. Genes for nitrogen assimilation were also affected in the mutants. These results provide evidence that OsDOF18 mediates ammonium transport and nitrogen distribution, which then affects nitrogen use efficiency.
28260830	Is early morning flowering an effective trait to minimize heat stress damage during flowering in rice?	2017	Field Crops Res	Higher spikelet sterility due to heat stress exposure during flowering in rice is becoming a major threat for sustaining productivity in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Therefore, exploiting and incorporating early morning flowering (EMF) trait into ongoing breeding pipelines could be an effective strategy to minimize the damage. In this study, we have focused on quantifying the time of day of flowering traits such as first spikelet opening time (FSOT) and peak spikelet opening time (PSOT) in a diverse set of cultivars (n = 289) representing major rice growing regions (13 tropical and 20 subtropical countries) over three years (wet season; WS-2012, dry season; DS-2013 and 2014), under field conditions. EMF traits (FSOT and PSOT) and spikelet sterility displayed significant (p < 0.001) variations among cultivars, both within and between seasons (WS and DS). Averaged across two dry seasons, the FSOT ranged between 2.35 h and 5.08 h after dawn compared to 3.05 h and 5.50 h during the WS, while, PSOT varied from 3.32 to 6.27 h in DS and from 3.50 to 7.05 h in WS. On average, PSOT was strongly associated with FSOT both in WS (R2 = 0.78) and DS (R2 = 0.77). A near-isogenic line (IR64 + qEMF3) effectively minimized the spikelet sterility by 71% during dry seasons under field conditions compared to 289 tropical and subtropical cultivars. None of the tropical and subtropical originated cultivars possess EMF trait including the popular IR64, thus indicating the usefulness of incorporating this trait to reduce heat stress damage under hotter climate. Our findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of the EMF trait in overcoming heat stress induced sterility under field conditions. Hence, it sounds logical to introgress EMF trait into currently growing popular rice cultivars for improving their resilience to heat stress episodes coinciding with flowering.
28254681	Provitamin A biofortification of crop plants: a gold rush with many miners.	2017	Curr Opin Biotechnol	Carotenoids are synthesized de novo by plants, where they play fundamental physiological roles as photosynthetic pigments and precursors for signaling molecules. They are also essential components of a healthy diet, as dietary antioxidants and vitamin A precursors. Vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem in developing countries, which has prompted a series of efforts toward the biofortification of plant-derived foods with provitamin A carotenoids (mainly β-carotene), giving rise to 'golden' crops. Since the 'golden rice' exploit, a number of biofortified crops have been generated, using transgenic approaches as well as conventional breeding. Bioavailability studies have demonstrated the efficacy of several 'golden' crops in maintaining vitamin A status. This review presents the state of the art and the areas that need further experimentation.
28300754	Effects of Light-Emitting Diode Irradiation on Growth Characteristics and Regulation of Porphyrin Biosynthesis in Rice Seedlings.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	We examined the effects of light quality on growth characteristics and porphyrin biosynthesis of rice seedlings grown under different wavelengths from light emitting diodes (LEDs). After 10 days of exposure to various wavelengths of LEDs, leaf area and shoot biomass were greater in seedlings grown under white and blue LEDs than those of green and red LEDs. Both green and red LED treatments drastically decreased levels of protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX) and Mg-porphyrins compared to those of white LED, while levels of Mg-Proto IX monomethyl ester and protochlorophyllide under blue LED were decreased by 21% and 49%, respectively. Transcript levels of PPO1 were greatly upregulated in seedlings grown under red LED compared to white LED, whereas transcript levels of HO2 and CHLD were upregulated under blue LED. Overall, most porphyrin biosynthetic genes in the Fe-porphyrin branch remained almost constant or upregulated, while most genes in the Mg-porphyrin branch were downregulated. Expression levels of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes Lhcb and RbcS noticeably decreased after exposure to blue and red LEDs, compared to white LED. Our study suggests that specific wavelengths of LED greatly influence characteristics of growth in plants partly through altering the metabolic regulation of the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway, and possibly contribute to affect retrograde signaling.
28101936	Quantitative iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of rice grains to assess high night temperature stress.	2017	Proteomics	Rice yield and quality are adversely affected by increasing global surface temperature, and are strongly attributed to high night temperature (HNT) than high daytime temperature. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the heat-tolerant characteristics of rice remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the proteomes of heat-tolerant and -sensitive lines of rice at early milky stage using an iTRAQ method. We have identified 38 differentially expressed proteins between the two lines, of which 32 proteins have been functionally annotated in NCBI and/or the UniProt database. These proteins were then classified into seven functional subgroups, which include signal transduction, transcript regulation, oxidation, defense response, transport, energy metabolism, and biosynthesis. Further analysis indicated that HNT stress could disrupt the redox equilibrium of plant cells, which in turn triggers the calcium-dependent protein kinase and COP9 signalosome, thereby regulating downstream genes/proteins that are involved in the HNT response. The candidate proteins may provide genetic resources for the improvement of heat-tolerant characteristics in rice, and the proposed model for signal transduction and transcriptional regulation may facilitate in the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the response to HNT stress in rice.
28283703	Substitution mapping of QTLs controlling seed dormancy using single segment substitution lines derived from multiple cultivated rice donors in seven cropping seasons.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A permanent advanced population containing 388 SSSLs was used for genetic analysis of seed dormancy; 25 QTLs including eight stable, six major and five new were identified. Seed dormancy (SD) is not only a complex biological phenomenon, but also a key practical problem in agricultural production closely related with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). However, the genetic mechanisms of SD remain elusive. Here, we report the genetic dissection of SD in rice using 388 single segment substitution lines (SSSLs) derived from 16 donor parents. Continuous variation and positive correlations in seed germination percentages were observed in seven seasons. Genetic analysis revealed the narrow sense heritability in different seasons varied from 31.4 to 82.2% with an average value of 56.8%. In addition, 49 SSSLs exhibited significant difference to recipient parent HJX74 on SD in at least two seasons, and 12 of them were stably identified with putative QTLs in all of their corresponding cropping seasons. Based on substitution mapping, a total of 25 dormancy QTLs were detected on 11 chromosomes except the chromosome 5 with an interval length of 1.1 to 31.3 cM. The additive effects of these QTLs changed from -0.31 to -0.13, and the additive effect contributions ranged from 16.7 to 41.4%. Six QTLs, qSD3-2, qSD4-1, qSD7-1, qSD7-2, qSD7-3 and qSD11-2, showed large additive effect contributions (≥30%). Five QTLs, qSD3-3, qSD7-1, qSD7-4, qSD9-1 and qSD10-1, may represent novel ones. Furthermore, linkage and recombinant analysis delimited qSD7-1 to a locus 1.5 cM away from marker Oi2 and a 355-kb fragment flanked by RM1134 and Ui159, respectively. Taken together, this work conducts a comprehensive genetic dissection of SD and will provide more selections for breeding elite PHS-resistant rice varieties.
28115496	Common Stress Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Functional and Genomic Architecture Differences Between Early and Delayed Response Genes.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	To identify the similarities among responses to diverse environmental stresses, we analyzed the transcriptome response of rice roots to three rhizotoxic perturbations (chromium, ferulic acid and mercury) and identified common early-transient, early-constant and delayed gene inductions. Common early response genes were mostly associated with signal transduction and hormones, and delayed response genes with lipid metabolism. Network component analysis revealed complicated interactions among common genes, the most highly connected signaling hubs being PP2C68, MPK5, LRR-RLK and NPR1. Gene architecture studies revealed different conserved promoter motifs and a different ratio of CpG island distribution between early and delayed genes. In addition, early-transient genes had more exons and a shorter first exon. IMEter was used to calculate the transcription regulation effects of introns, with greater effects for the first introns of early-transient than delayed genes. The higher Ka/Ks (non-synonymous/synonymous mutation) ratio of early-constant genes than early-transient, delayed and the genome median demonstrates the rapid evolution of early-constant genes. Our results suggest that finely tuned transcriptional control in response to environmental stress in rice depends on genomic architecture and signal intensity and duration.
28154240	Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance.	2017	Science	Crop breeding aims to balance disease resistance with yield; however, single resistance (R) genes can lead to resistance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice Pigm locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. PigmS expression, and thus PigmR-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. PigmS increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by PigmR Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease resistance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.

28179101	Molecular phylogenomic study and the role of exogenous spermidine in the metabolic adjustment of endogenous polyamine in two rice cultivars under salt stress.	2017	Gene	Compelling evidences anticipated the well acclamation of involvement of exogenous and endogenous polyamines (PAs) in conferring salt tolerance in plants. Intracellular PA's anabolism and catabolism should have contributed to maintain endogenous PAs homeostasis to induce stress signal networks. In this report, the evolutionary study has been conducted to reveal the phylogenetic relationship of genes encoding enzymes of the anabolic and catabolic pathway of PAs among the five plant lineages including green algae, moss, lycophyte, dicot and monocot along with their respective exon-intron structural patterns. Our results indicated that natural selection pressure had considerable influence on the ancestral PA metabolic pathway coding genes of land plants. PA metabolic genes have undergone gradual evolution by duplication and diversification process leading to subsequent structural modification through exon-intron gain and loss events to acquire specific function under environmental stress conditions. We have illuminated on the potential regulation of both the pathways by investigating the real-time expression analyses of PA metabolic pathway related enzyme coding genes at the transcriptional level in root and shoot tissues of two indica rice varieties, namely IR 36 (salt sensitive) and Nonabokra (salt-tolerant) in response to salinity in presence or absence of exogenous spermidine (Spd) treatment. Additionally, we have performed tissue specific quantification of the intracellular PAs and tried to draw probable connection between the PA metabolic pathway activation and endogenous PAs accumulation. Our results successfully enlighten the fact that how exogenous Spd in presence or absence of salt stress adjust the intracellular PA pathways to equilibrate the cellular PAs that would have been attributed to plant salt tolerance.
28182328	Overexpression of the leucine-rich receptor-like kinase gene LRK2 increases drought tolerance and tiller number in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought represents a key limiting factor of global crop distribution. Receptor-like kinases play major roles in plant development and defence responses against stresses such as drought. In this study, LRK2, which encodes a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, was cloned and characterized and found to be localized on the plasma membrane in rice. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed strong expression in tiller buds, roots, nodes and anthers. Transgenic plants overexpressing LRK2 exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought stress due to an increased number of lateral roots compared with the wild type at the vegetative stage. Moreover, ectopic expression of LRK2 seedlings resulted in increased tiller development. Yeast two-hybrid screening and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) indicated a possible interaction between LRK2 and elongation factor 1 alpha (OsEF1A) in vitro. These results suggest that LRK2 functions as a positive regulator of the drought stress response and tiller development via increased branch development in rice. These findings will aid our understanding of branch regulation in other grasses and support improvements in rice genetics.
28181537	Analysis of drought-responsive signalling network in two contrasting rice cultivars using transcriptome-based approach.	2017	Sci Rep	Traditional cultivars of rice in India exhibit tolerance to drought stress due to their inherent genetic variations. Here we present comparative physiological and transcriptome analyses of two contrasting cultivars, drought tolerant Dhagaddeshi (DD) and susceptible IR20. Microarray analysis revealed several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exclusively in DD as compared to IR20 seedlings exposed to 3 h drought stress. Physiologically, DD seedlings showed higher cell membrane stability and differential ABA accumulation in response to dehydration, coupled with rapid changes in gene expression. Detailed analyses of metabolic pathways enriched in expression data suggest interplay of ABA dependent along with secondary and redox metabolic networks that activate osmotic and detoxification signalling in DD. By co-localization of DEGs with QTLs from databases or published literature for physiological traits of DD and IR20, candidate genes were identified including those underlying major QTL qDTY1.1 in DD. Further, we identified previously uncharacterized genes from both DD and IR20 under drought conditions including OsWRKY51, OsVP1 and confirmed their expression by qPCR in multiple rice cultivars. OsFBK1 was also functionally validated in susceptible PB1 rice cultivar and Arabidopsis for providing drought tolerance. Some of the DEGs mapped to the known QTLs could thus, be of potential significance for marker-assisted breeding.
28220451	OsRLCK 57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 Positively Regulate Chitin- and PGN-Induced Immunity in Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK176 has been reported to participate in both chitin- and PGN-induced immunity in rice. Here, we further researched the function of the homologous proteins, OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, in chitin- and PGN immunity in rice.

FINDINGS: Silencing of OsRLCK57,OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 suppressed chitin- and PGN-induced immunity responses, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene expression. Furthermore, OsRLCK107 could interact with OsCERK1 in a MAMP induced way, which suggested a possible physiological relevance of OsRLCKs107 to OsCERK1 pathway.

CONCLUSIONS: OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, positively regulate chitin- and PGN- induced responses in rice, similar to that observed in OsRLCK176.
28220688	The DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Mol Plant Pathol	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (synonym: Pyricularia oryzae), severely reduces rice production and grain quality. The molecular mechanism of rice resistance to M. oryzae is not fully understood. In this study, we identified a chaperone DnaJ protein, OsDjA6, which is involved in basal resistance to M. oryzae in rice. The OsDjA6 protein is distributed in the entire rice cell. The expression of OsDjA6 is significantly induced in rice after infection with a compatible isolate. Silencing of OsDjA6 in transgenic rice enhances resistance to M. oryzae and also results in an increased burst of reactive oxygen species after flg22 and chitin treatments. In addition, the expression levels of WRKY45, NPR1 and PR5 are increased in OsDjA6 RNAi plants, indicating that OsDjA6 may mediate resistance by affecting the salicylic acid pathway. Finally, we found that OsDjA6 interacts directly with the E3 ligase OsZFP1 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity, probably via the ubiquitination proteasome degradation pathway.
28234896	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	2017	PLoS Genet	The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a critical process in the life cycle of higher plants. Previously, we cloned Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), which acts as the master switch for the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase in rice. Although the photoperiod pathway of RID1 inducing expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 via Ehd1 has been established, the alternative pathways for the essential flowering transition need to be further examined. Here, we identified a Suppressor of rid1 (SID1), which rescues the never-flowering phenotype of rid1. SID1 encodes an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) transcription factor. Mutation in SID1 showed the delayed flowering phenotype. Gain-of-function of SID1, OsIDD1, or OsIDD6 could restore the rid1 to flowering. Further analyses showed SID1 and RID1 directly target the promoter regions of Hd3a and RFT1, two florigen genes in rice. Taken together, our results reveal an autonomous flowering pathway might be mediated by RID1, thereby controlling the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive development in rice.
28226420	pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 expression enhances nitrogen uptake efficiency and grain yield in transgenic rice plants.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The nitrate (NO3-) transporter has been selected as an important gene maker in the process of environmental adoption in rice cultivars. In this work, we transferred another native OsNAR2.1 promoter with driving OsNAR2.1 gene into rice plants. The transgenic lines with exogenous pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 constructs showed enhanced OsNAR2.1 expression level, compared with wild type (WT), and 15 N influx in roots increased 21%-32% in response to 0.2 mm and 2.5 mm 15NO3- and 1.25 mm 15 NH415 NO3 . Under these three N conditions, the biomass of the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 transgenic lines increased 143%, 129% and 51%, and total N content increased 161%, 242% and 69%, respectively, compared to WT. Furthermore in field experiments we found the grain yield, agricultural nitrogen use efficiency (ANUE), and dry matter transfer of pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 plants increased by about 21%, 22% and 21%, compared to WT. We also compared the phenotypes of pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 and pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines in the field, found that postanthesis N uptake differed significantly between them, and in comparison with the WT. Postanthesis N uptake (PANU) increased approximately 39% and 85%, in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 and pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines, respectively, possibly because OsNRT2.1 expression was less in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 lines than in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines during the late growth stage. These results show that rice NO3- uptake, yield and NUE were improved by increased OsNAR2.1 expression via its native promoter.
28157263	A phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C pathway elicits stress-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and confers salt tolerance to rice.	2017	New Phytol	In animal cells, phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms predominantly hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphates [PtdIns(4,5)P2 ] into the second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3 ] to regulate diverse biological processes. By contrast, the molecular mechanisms and physiological significance of PLC signaling in plants still awaits full elucidation. Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa cv) PI-PLC, OsPLC1, which preferred to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and elicited stress-induced Ca2+ signals regulating salt tolerance. Analysis by ion chromatography revealed that the concentration of PtdIns4P was c. 28 times of that of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in shoots. OsPLC1 not only converted PtdIns(4,5)P2 but also - and even more efficiently - converted PtdIns4P into DAG and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in vitro and in vivo. Salt stress induced the recruitment of OsPLC1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, where it hydrolyzed PtdIns4P. The stress-induced Ca2+ signaling was dependent on OsPLC1, and the PLC-mediated Ca2+ signaling was essential for controlling Na+ accumulation in leaf blades, thus establishing whole plant salt tolerance. Our work identifies a conversion pathway and physiological function for PtdIns4P pools in rice and reveals the connection between phosphoinositides and Ca2+ signals mediated by PLC during salt stress responses.
28244201	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The AP2/ERF family is a plant-specific transcription factor family whose members have been associated with various developmental processes and stress tolerance. Here, we functionally characterized the drought-inducible OsERF48, a group Ib member of the rice ERF family with four conserved motifs, CMI-1, -2, -3 and -4. A transactivation assay in yeast revealed that the C-terminal CMI-1 motif was essential for OsERF48 transcriptional activity. When OsERF48 was overexpressed in an either a root-specific (ROXOsERF48 ) or whole-body (OXOsERF48 ) manner, transgenic plants showed a longer and denser root phenotype compared to the nontransgenic (NT) controls. When plants were grown on a 40% polyethylene glycol-infused medium under in vitro drought conditions, ROXOsERF48 plants showed a more vigorous root growth than OXOsERF48 and NT plants. In addition, the ROXOsERF48 plants exhibited higher grain yield than OXOsERF48 and NT plants under field-drought conditions. We constructed a putative OsERF48 regulatory network by cross-referencing ROXOsERF48 root-specific RNA-seq data with a co-expression network database, from which we inferred the involvement of 20 drought-related genes in OsERF48-mediated responses. These included genes annotated as being involved in stress signalling, carbohydrate metabolism, cell-wall proteins and drought responses. They included, OsCML16, a key gene in calcium signalling during abiotic stress, which was shown to be a direct target of OsERF48 by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR analysis and a transient protoplast expression assay. Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
28173633	A novel functional gene associated with cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Identification and cloning of cold-tolerant genes that can stably express under different cold environments are crucial for molecular rice breeding for cold tolerance. In the previous study, we identified a cold-tolerant QTL at the seedling stage, qCTS-9 which could be detected under different cold environments using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cold-tolerant variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) and a cold-sensitive variety Shanhuangzhan 2 (SHZ-2). In this study, eight candidate genes within the qCTS-9 interval were identified through integrated analysis of QTL mapping with genomewide differential expression profiling of LTH. The qRT-PCR assay showed that only Os09g0410300 exhibited different expression patterns between LTH and SHZ-2 during cold stress, and significantly positive correlation was found between cold induction of Os09g0410300 and seedling cold tolerance in the RI lines. Five SNPs and one InDel in the promoters of Os09g0410300 were detected between LTH and SHZ-2, and the InDel marker ID410300 designed based on the insertion-deletion polymorphism in the promoter was significantly associated with seedling cold tolerance in RIL population. Further, Os09g0410300 over-expression plants exhibited enhanced cold tolerance at the seedling stage compared with the wild-type plants. Thus, our results suggest that Os09g0410300 is the functional gene underlying qCTS-9. To our knowledge, it is a novel gene contributed to enhance cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice. Identification of the functional gene underlying qCTS-9 and development of the gene-specific marker will facilitate molecular breeding for cold tolerance at the seedling stage in rice through transgenic approach and marker-assisted selection (MAS).
28230163	Ectopic expression of Arabidopsis Target of Rapamycin (AtTOR) improves water-use efficiency and yield potential in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	The target of Rapamycin (TOR) present in all eukaryotes is a multifunctional protein, regulating growth, development, protein translation, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient, and energy signaling. In the present study, ectopic expression of TOR gene of Arabidopsis thaliana in a widely cultivated indica rice resulted in enhanced plant growth under water-limiting conditions conferring agronomically important water-use efficiency (WUE) trait. The AtTOR high expression lines of rice exhibited profuse tillering, increased panicle length, increased plant height, high photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll content and low ∆13C. Δ13C, which is inversely related to high WUE, was as low as 17‰ in two AtTOR high expression lines. These lines were also insensitive to the ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination. The significant upregulation of 15 stress-specific genes in high expression lines indicates their contribution to abiotic stress tolerance. The constitutive expression of AtTOR is also associated with significant transcriptional upregulation of putative TOR complex-1 components, OsRaptor and OsLST8. Glucose-mediated transcriptional activation of AtTOR gene enhanced lateral root formation. Taken together, our findings indicate that TOR, in addition to its multiple cellular functions, also plays an important role in response to abiotic stress and potentially enhances WUE and yield related attributes.
28223030	Heterologous expression of a rice metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhances cadmium, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol tolerance.	None	Braz J Microbiol	Metallothioneins are a superfamily of low-molecular-weight, cysteine (Cys)-rich proteins that are believed to play important roles in protection against metal toxicity and oxidative stress. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of heterologous expression of a rice metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) on the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Cd2+, H2O2 and ethanol stress. The gene encoding OsMTI-1b was cloned into p426GPD as a yeast expression vector. The new construct was transformed to competent cells of S. cerevisiae. After verification of heterologous expression of OsMTI-1b, the new strain and control were grown under stress conditions. In comparison to control strain, the transformed S. cerevisiae cells expressing OsMTI-1b showed more tolerance to Cd2+ and accumulated more Cd2+ ions when they were grown in the medium containing CdCl2. In addition, the heterologous expression of GST-OsMTI-1b conferred H2O2 and ethanol tolerance to S. cerevisiae cells. The results indicate that heterologous expression of plant MT isoforms can enhance the tolerance of S. cerevisiae to multiple stresses.
28229491	OsNLA1, a RING-type ubiquitin ligase, maintains phosphate homeostasis in Oryza sativa via degradation of phosphate transporters.	2017	Plant J	Inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters (PTs) play vital roles in Pi uptake and translocation in plants. Under Pi sufficient conditions, PTs are degraded to prevent excess Pi accumulation. The mechanisms targeting PTs for degradation are not fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the Oryza sativa (rice) ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana nitrogen limitation adaptation (NLA), OsNLA1 protein, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase, was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane, and could interact with rice phosphate transporters OsPT2 and OsPT8. Mutation of the 265th cysteine residue in OsNLA1 that was required for ubiquitination prevented breakdown of OsPT2/PT8, suggesting OsNLA1 targeted OsPT2/PT8 for degradation. Mutation in OsNLA1 (osnla1) led to a significant increase of Pi concentration in leaves in a nitrate-independent manner. Overexpression of OsNLA1 or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in osnla1 mutants to a level similar to that of wild-type plants. In contrast to what has been observed in Arabidopsis, the transcript abundance of OsNLA1 did not decrease under Pi limited conditions or in OsmiR827 (microRNA827)- or OsPHR2 (PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2)-overexpressing transgenic lines. Moreover, there was no interaction of OsNLA1 and OsPHO2, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugase, suggesting that OsPHO2 was not the partner of OsNLA1 involved in ubiquitin-mediated PT degradation. Our results show that OsNLA1 is involved in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice by mediating the degradation of OsPT2 and OsPT8, and OsNLA1 differs from the ortholog in Arabidopsis in several aspects.
28160062	Comparison of the impact of viral and plant-derived promoters regulating selectable marker gene on maize transformation and transgene expression.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The choice of promoter regulating the selectable marker gene impacts transformation efficiency, copy number and the expression of selectable marker and flanking genes in maize. Viral or plant-derived constitutive promoters are often used to regulate selectable marker genes. We compared two viral promoters, cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35T) and sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV) with two plant promoters, rice actin1 (OsAct1) and maize ubiquitin 1 (ZmUbi1) to drive aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase (aad-1) selectable marker gene in maize inbred line B104. ZmUbi1- and OsAct1-containing constructs demonstrated higher transformation frequencies (43.8 and 41.4%, respectively) than the two viral promoter constructs, CaMV 35T (25%) and SCBV (8%). Interestingly, a higher percentage of single copy events were recovered for SCBV (82.1%) and CaMV 35T (59.3%) promoter constructs, compared to the two plant-derived promoters, OsAct1 (40.0%), and ZmUbi1 (27.6%). Analysis of protein expression suggested that the viral promoter CaMV 35T expressed significantly higher AAD-1 protein (174.6 ng/cm2) than the OsAct1 promoter (12.6 ng/cm2) in T0 leaf tissue. When measured in T2 callus tissue, the two viral promoters both had higher expression and more variability than the two plant-derived promoters. A potential explanation for why viral promoters produce lower transformation efficiencies but higher percentages of low copy number events is discussed. In addition, viral promoters regulating aad-1 were found to influence the expression of upstream flanking genes in both T0 leaf and T2 callus tissue.
28244994	Precise base editing in rice, wheat and maize with a Cas9-cytidine deaminase fusion.	2017	Nat Biotechnol	Targeted base editing in plants without the need for a foreign DNA donor or double-stranded DNA cleavage would accelerate genome modification and breeding in a wide array of crops. We used a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase-cytidine deaminase fusion to achieve targeted conversion of cytosine to thymine from position 3 to 9 within the protospacer in both protoplasts and regenerated rice, wheat and maize plants at frequencies of up to 43.48%.
28282268	Construction of recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica and its application in bio-transformation of lignocellulose.	2017	Bioengineered	Lignocellulose is a polysaccharide and an abundant biomass resource that widely exists in grains, beans, rice, and their by-products. Over 10 million tons of lignocellulose resources and processing products are produced every year in China. Three recombinant Y. lipolytica strains with cellulase (β-glucosidase, endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase) were constructed. The enzymatic activities of these enzymes were 14.181 U/mL, 16.307 U/mL, and 17.391 U/mL, respectively. The whole cell cellulases were used for a stover bio-transformation. The celluloses in the stover were partly degraded by the cellulases, and the degradation products were transformed into single cell protein (SCP) by the Y. lipolytica cells. After 15 d of fermentation with the whole cell cellulases, the protein content of the maize stover and the rice straw reached 16.23% and 14.75%, which increased by 168.26% and 161.52% compared with the control, respectively. This study provides a new stage for the efficient utilization of stover in the feed industry.
28189051	Changes in root hydraulic conductivity facilitate the overall hydraulic response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars to salt and osmotic stress.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	The aim of the present work was to assess the significance of changes in root AQP gene expression and hydraulic conductivity (Lp) in the regulation of water balance in two hydroponically-grown rice cultivars (Azucena, Bala) which differ in root morphology, stomatal regulation and aquaporin (AQP) isoform expression. Plants were exposed to NaCl (25 mM, 50 mM) and osmotic stress (5%, 10% PEG6000). Root Lp was determined for exuding root systems (osmotic forces driving water uptake; 'exudation Lp') and transpiring plants (hydrostatic forces dominating; 'transpiration-Lp'). Gene expression was analysed by qPCR. Stress treatments caused a consistent and significant decrease in plant growth, transpirational water loss, stomatal conductance, shoot-to-root surface area ratio and root Lp. Comparison of exudation-with transpiration-Lp supported a significant contribution of AQP-facilitated water flow to root water uptake. Changes in root Lp in response to treatments were correlated much stronger with root morphological characteristics, such as the number of main and lateral roots, surface area ratio of root to shoot and plant transpiration rate than with AQP gene expression. Changes in root Lp, involving AQP function, form an integral part of the plant hydraulic response to stress and facilitate changes in the root-to-shoot surface area ratio, transpiration and stomatal conductance.
28235420	Altered expression profiles of microRNA families during de-etiolation of maize and rice leaves.	2017	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plants. Although many miRNA families are sequentially and functionally conserved across plant kingdoms (Dezulian et al. in Genome Biol 13, 2005), they still differ in many aspects such as family size, average length, genomic loci etc. (Unver et al. in Int J Plant Genomics, 2009).

RESULTS: In this study, we investigated changes of miRNA expression profiles during greening process of etiolated seedlings of Oryza sativa (C3) and Zea mays (C4) to explore conserved and species-specific characteristics of miRNAs between these two species. Futhermore, we predicted 47 and 42 candidate novel miRNAs using parameterized monocot specific miRDeep2 pipeline in maize and rice respectively. Potential targets of miRNAs comprising both mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) were examined to clarify potential regulation of photosynthesis. Based on our result, two putative positive Kranz regulators reported by Wang et al. (2010) were predicted as potential targets of miR156. A few photosynthesis related genes such as sulfate adenylytransferase (APS3), chlorophyll a/b binding family protein etc. were suggested to be regulated by miRNAs. However, no C4 shuttle genes were predicted to be direct targets of either known or candidate novel miRNAs.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the comprehensive list of miRNA that showed altered expression during the de-etiolation process and a number of candidate miRNAs that might play regulatory roles in C3 and C4 photosynthesis.
28185358	Effects of arginine and leucine substitutions on anti-endotoxic activities and mechanisms of action of cationic and amphipathic antimicrobial octadecapeptide from rice α-amylase.	2017	J Pept Sci	Previously, we showed that the antimicrobial cationic and amphipathic octadecapeptide AmyI-1-18 from rice α-amylase (AmyI-1) inhibited the endotoxic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. In addition, we demonstrated that several AmyI-1-18 analogs containing arginine or leucine substitutions, which were designed on the basis of the helical wheel projection of AmyI-1-18, exhibited higher antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic microorganisms than AmyI-1-18. In the present study, anti-inflammatory (anti-endotoxic) activities of five AmyI-1-18 analogs containing arginine or leucine substitutions were investigated. Two single arginine-substituted and two single leucine-substituted AmyI-1-18 analogs inhibited the production of LPS-induced nitric oxide in mouse macrophages (RAW264) more effectively than AmyI-1-18. These data indicate that enhanced cationic and hydrophobic properties of AmyI-1-18 are associated with improved anti-endotoxic activity. In subsequent chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assays, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 ) of the three AmyI-1-18 analogs (G12R, D15R, and E9L) were 0.11-0.13 μm, indicating higher anti-endotoxic activity than that of AmyI-1-18 (IC50, 0.22 μm), and specific LPS binding activity. In agreement, surface plasmon resonance analyses confirmed direct LPS binding of three AmyI-1-18 analogs. In addition, AmyI-1-18 analogs exhibited little or no cytotoxic activity against RAW264 cells, indicating that enhancements of anti-inflammatory and LPS-neutralizing activities following replacement of arginine or leucine did not result in significant increases in cytotoxicity. This study shows that the arginine-substituted and leucine-substituted AmyI-1-18 analogs with improved anti-endotoxic and antimicrobial activities have clinical potential as dual-function host defense agents.

28243709	Heterologous production of kasugamycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic from Streptomyces kasugaensis, in Streptomyces lividans and Rhodococcus erythropolis L-88 by constitutive expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster.	2017	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Kasugamycin (KSM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces kasugaensis cultures, has been used against rice blast disease for more than 50 years. We cloned the KSM biosynthetic gene (KBG) cluster from S. kasugaensis MB273-C4 and constructed three KBG cassettes (i.e., cassettes I-III) to enable heterologous production of KSM in many actinomycetes by constitutive expression of KBGs. Cassette I comprised all putative transcriptional units in the cluster, but it was placed under the control of the P neo promoter from Tn5. It was not maintained stably in Streptomyces lividans and did not transform Rhodococcus erythropolis. Cassette II retained the original arrangement of KBGs, except that the promoter of kasT, the specific activator gene for KBG, was replaced with P rpsJ , the constitutive promoter of rpsJ from Streptomyces avermitilis. To enhance the intracellular concentration of myo-inositol, an expression cassette of ino1 encoding the inositol-1-phosphate synthase from S. avermitilis was inserted into cassette II to generate cassette III. These two cassettes showed stable maintenance in S. lividans and R. erythropolis to produce KSM. Particularly, the transformants of S. lividans induced KSM production up to the same levels as those produced by S. kasugaensis. Furthermore, cassette III induced more KSM accumulation than cassette II in R. erythropolis, suggesting an exogenous supply of myo-inositol by the ino1 expression in the host. Cassettes II and III appear to be useful for heterologous KSM production in actinomycetes. Rhodococcus exhibiting a spherical form in liquid cultivation is also a promising heterologous host for antibiotic fermentation.
28483049	The rice TCD11 encoding plastid ribosomal protein S6 is essential for chloroplast development at low temperature.	2017	Plant Sci	Plastid ribosome proteins (PRPs) are important components for chloroplast biogenesis and early chloroplast development. Although it has been known that chloroplast ribosomes are similar to bacterial ones, the precise molecular function of ribosomal proteins remains to be elucidated in rice. Here, we identified a novel rice mutant, designated tcd11 (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 11), characterized by the albino phenotype until it died at 20°C, while displaying normal phenotype at 32°C. The alteration of leaf color in tcd11 mutants was aligned with chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development. The map-based cloning and molecular complementation showed that TCD11 encodes the ribosomal small subunit protein S6 in chloroplasts (RPS6). TCD11 was abundantly expressed in leaves, suggesting its different expressions in tissues. In addition, the disruption of TCD11 greatly reduced the transcript levels of certain chloroplasts-associated genes and prevented the assembly of ribosome in chloroplasts at low temperature (20°C), whereas they recovered to nearly normal levels at high temperature (32°C). Thus, our data indicate that TCD11 plays an important role in chloroplast development at low temperature. Upon our knowledge, the observations from this study provide a first glimpse into the importance of RPS6 function in rice chloroplast development.
28282527	High temperature effects on Pi54 conferred resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in two genetic backgrounds of Oryza sativa.	2017	J Plant Physiol	The global temperatures are predicted to rise due to climate change. However, knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the effect of high temperature (HT) on plant pathogen interaction is limited. We investigated the effect of elevated temperature on host phenotypic, biochemical and gene expression patterns in the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae (Mo) pathosystem using two genetic backgrounds, Co39 (Oryzae sativa-indica) and LTH (O. sativa-japonica) with (CO and LT) and without (Co39 and LTH) R gene (Pi54). After exposure to 28°C and 35°C the two genetic backgrounds showed contrasting responses to Mo. At 28°C, CO, Co39 and LTH displayed a more severe disease phenotype than LT. Surprisingly, CO became resistant to Mo after exposure to 35°C. CO and LT were used for further analysis to determine the defence related biochemical and transcriptome changes associated with HT induced resistance. Pre-exposure to 35°C triggered intense callose deposits and cell wall fluorescence of the attacked epidermal cells, as well as, increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid (SA) levels. Transcriptional changes due to combined stress (35°C+Mo) were largely overridden by pathogen infection in both backgrounds, suggesting that the plants tended to shift their response to the pathogen. However, significant differences in global gene expression patterns occurred between CO and LT in response to both single (35°C and Mo) and double stress (35°C+Mo). Collectively, our results suggest that rice lines carrying Pi54 respond to Mo by rapid induction of callose and H2O2, and that these resistance mechanisms are amplified at HT. The relative difference in disease severity between CO and LT at 28°C suggests that the genetic background of japonica rice facilitates the function of Pi54 more than the background of indica rice. The phenotypic plasticity and gene expression differences between CO and LT reveal the presence of intricate background specific molecular signatures that may potentially influence adaptation to plant stresses.
28245796	Gene expression and plant hormone levels in two contrasting rice genotypes responding to brown planthopper infestation.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a destructive piercing-sucking insect pest of rice. The plant hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important roles in plant-pest interactions. Many isolated rice genes that modulate BPH resistance are involved in the metabolism or signaling pathways of SA, JA and ethylene. 'Rathu Heenati' (RH) is a rice cultivar with a high-level, broad-spectrum resistance to all BPH biotypes. Here, RH was used as the research material, while a BPH-susceptible rice cultivar 'Taichung Native 1' (TN1) was the control. A cDNA microarray analysis illuminated the resistance response at the genome level of RH under BPH infestation. The levels of SA and JA in RH and TN1 seedlings after BPH infestation were also determined.

RESULTS: The expression pattern clustering indicated that 1467 differential probe sets may be associated with constitutive resistance and 67 with the BPH infestation-responsive resistance of RH. A Venn diagram analysis revealed 192 RH-specific and BPH-inducible probe sets. Finally, 23 BPH resistance-related gene candidates were selected based on the expression pattern clustering and Venn diagram analysis. In RH, the SA content significantly increased and the JA content significantly decreased after BPH infestation, with the former occurring prior to the latter. In RH, the differential genes in the SA pathway were synthesis-related and were up-regulated after BPH infestation. The differential genes in the JA pathway were also up-regulated. They were jasmonate ZIM-domain transcription factors, which are important negative regulators of the JA pathway. Comparatively, genes involved in the ET pathway were less affected by a BPH infestation in RH. DNA sequence analysis revealed that most BPH infestation-inducible genes may be regulated by the genetic background in a trans-acting manner, instead of by their promoters.

CONCLUSIONS: We profiled the analysis of the global gene expression in RH and TN1 under BPH infestation, together with changes in the SA and JA levels. SA plays a leading role in the resistance response of rice to BPH. Our results will aid in understanding the molecular basis of RH's BPH resistance and facilitate the identification of new resistance-related genes for breeding BPH-resistant rice varieties.
28173747	Origin and diversification of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) genes in plants.	2017	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases (LRR-RLKs) are the largest group of receptor-like kinases in plants and play crucial roles in development and stress responses. The evolutionary relationships among LRR-RLK genes have been investigated in flowering plants; however, no comprehensive studies have been performed for these genes in more ancestral groups. The subfamily classification of LRR-RLK genes in plants, the evolutionary history and driving force for the evolution of each LRR-RLK subfamily remain to be understood.

RESULTS: We identified 119 LRR-RLK genes in the Physcomitrella patens moss genome, 67 LRR-RLK genes in the Selaginella moellendorffii lycophyte genome, and no LRR-RLK genes in five green algae genomes. Furthermore, these LRR-RLK sequences, along with previously reported LRR-RLK sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, were subjected to evolutionary analyses. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that plant LRR-RLKs belong to 19 subfamilies, eighteen of which were established in early land plants, and one of which evolved in flowering plants. More importantly, we found that the basic structures of LRR-RLK genes for most subfamilies are established in early land plants and conserved within subfamilies and across different plant lineages, but divergent among subfamilies. In addition, most members of the same subfamily had common protein motif compositions, whereas members of different subfamilies showed variations in protein motif compositions. The unique gene structure and protein motif compositions of each subfamily differentiate the subfamily classifications and, more importantly, provide evidence for functional divergence among LRR-RLK subfamilies. Maximum likelihood analyses showed that some sites within four subfamilies were under positive selection.

CONCLUSIONS: Much of the diversity of plant LRR-RLK genes was established in early land plants. Positive selection contributed to the evolution of a few LRR-RLK subfamilies.
28215140	Position Based Nucleotide Analysis of miR168 Family in Higher Plants and its Targets in Mammalian Transcripts.	2017	Microrna	BACKGROUND: miRNA are the post transcriptional regulator of the genes. The conserved miR168 family is evaluated for position based nucleotide preference in higher plants. Low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) target validated for miR168a obtained from rice origin is reported.

METHODS: The mature miRNA sequences include miR168-5p and miR168-3p, were obtained from miRBase (v21, June 2014) for 15 families (28 plants). The preferred position based nucleotide sequences were obtained using Data Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution software. The miR168-5p was subjected to cross kingdom analysis using psRNATarget. Target expression and functional annotation was analyzed by using Human Protein Atlas database WEB-based Gene SeTAnaLysis Toolkit.

RESULTS: miR168-5p shows same nucleotides at positions 1-6, 8-9, 11-12, 15-17 and 19. Also, miR168-3p is present in 3 families (10 plants) shows the same nucleotide at position 1-11, 13-15 and 17-21. The 123 targets in human transcriptome were identified showing 58% cleavage and 41% translation repression. Low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) target validated for miR168a obtained from rice origin, could also be targeted from miR168 from any other plant sources. The randomly selected 10 targets include some important genes likeRPL34, ATXN1, AKAPI3 and ALS2 and is involved in transcription, cell trafficking, cell metabolism and neurodegenerative disorder.

CONCLUSION: Our work suggests that miR168 family has conserved sequence in higher plants. The seed region position 2-8 shows 70-95% pairing with human targets. Cleavage site at position 10-14 and these were analysed for the base preference with the targets showed 80-96% Watson Crick pairing.
28150142	Genome-wide exploration of metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes in common wheat (Triticum aestivum): insights into metal homeostasis and biofortification.	2017	Biometals	Metal transport process in plants is a determinant of quality and quantity of the harvest. Although it is among the most important of staple crops, knowledge about genes that encode for membrane-bound metal transporters is scarce in wheat. Metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) are involved in trace metal homeostasis at the sub-cellular level, usually by providing metal efflux out of the cytosol. Here, by using various bioinformatics approaches, genes that encode for MTPs in the hexaploid wheat genome (Triticum aestivum, abbreviated as Ta) were identified and characterized. Based on the comparison with known rice MTPs, the wheat genome contained 20 MTP sequences; named as TaMTP1-8A, B and D. All TaMTPs contained a cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family domain and most members harbored a zinc transporter dimerization domain. Based on motif, phylogeny and alignment analysis, A, B and D genomes of TaMTP3-7 sequences demonstrated higher homology compared to TaMTP1, 2 and 8. With reference to their rice orthologs, TaMTP1s and TaMTP8s belonged to Zn-CDFs, TaMTP2s to Fe/Zn-CDFs and TaMTP3-7s to Mn-CDFs. Upstream regions of TaMTP genes included diverse cis-regulatory motifs, indicating regulation by developmental stage, tissue type and stresses. A scan of the coding sequences of 20 TaMTPs against published miRNAs predicted a total of 14 potential miRNAs, mainly targeting the members of most diverged groups. Expression analysis showed that several TaMTPs were temporally and spatially regulated during the developmental time-course. In grains, MTPs were preferentially expressed in the aleurone layer, which is known as a reservoir for high concentrations of iron and zinc. The work identified and characterized metal tolerance proteins in common wheat and revealed a potential involvement of MTPs in providing a sink for trace element storage in wheat grains.
28176282	Evolutionary analysis of the SUB1 locus across the Oryza genomes.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Tolerance to complete submergence is recognized in a limited number of Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties, most of which contain submergence-inducible SUB1A on the polygenic SUBMERGENCE-1 (SUB1) locus. It has been shown that the SUB1 locus encodes two Ethylene-Responsive Factor (ERF) genes, SUB1B and SUB1C, in all O. sativa varieties. These genes were also found in O rufipogon and O nivara, wild relatives of O. sativa. However, detailed analysis of the polygenic locus in other Oryza species has not yet been made.

FINDINGS: Chromosomal location, phylogenetic, and gene structure analyses have revealed that the SUB1 locus is conserved in the long arm of chromosome 9 in most Oryza species. We also show that the SUB1A-like gene of O. nivara is on chromosome 1 and that Leersia perrieri, a grass-tolerant to deep-flooding, presents three ERF genes in the SUB1 locus.

CONCLUSION: We provide here a deeper insight into the evolutionary origin and variation of the SUB1 locus and raise the possibility that an association of these genes with flooding tolerance in L. perrieri may exist.
28166742	Analysis of small RNAs revealed differential expressions during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice.	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Partial pollen and embryo sac sterilities are the two main reasons for low fertility in autotetraploid rice. Our previous study revealed that small RNAs changes may associate with pollen fertility in autotetraploid rice. However, knowledge on comparative analysis between the development of pollen and embryo sac by small RNAs in autotetraploid rice is still unknown. In the present study, WE-CLSM (whole-mount eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy) and high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to examine the cytological variations and to analyze small RNAs changes during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice compared with its diploid counterpart.

RESULTS: A total of 321 and 368 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEM) were detected during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice, respectively. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on the targets of DEM associated with embryo sac and pollen development revealed 30 prominent functional gene classes, such as cell differentiation and signal transduction during embryo sac development, while only 7 prominent functional gene classes, such as flower development and transcription factor activity, were detected during pollen development in autotetraploid rice. The expression levels of 39 DEM, which revealed interaction with meiosis-related genes, showed opposite expression patterns during pollen and embryo sac development. Of these DEM, osa-miR1436_L + 3_1ss5CT and osa-miR167h-3p were associated with the female meiosis, while osa-miR159a.1 and osa-MIR159a-p5 were related with the male meiosis. 21 nt-phasiRNAs were detected during both pollen and embryo sac development, while 24 nt-phasiRNAs were found only in pollen development, which displayed down-regulation in autotetraploid compared to diploid rice and their spatial-temporal expression patterns were similar to osa-miR2275d. 24 nt TEs-siRNAs were found to be up-regulated in embryo sac but down-regulated in pollen development.

CONCLUSION: The above results not only provide the small RNAs changes during four landmark stages of pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice but also have identified specifically expressed miRNAs, especially meiosis-related miRNAs, pollen-specific-24 nt-phasiRNAs and TEs-siRNAs in autotetraploid rice. Together, these findings provide a foundation for understanding the effect of polyploidy on small RNAs expression patterns during pollen and embryo sac development that may lead to different abnormalities in autotetraploid rice.
28225074	The WASP-Arp2/3 complex signal cascade is involved in actin-dependent sperm nuclei migration during double fertilization in tobacco and maize.	2017	Sci Rep	Sperm nuclear migration during fertilization in Arabidopsis and rice has recently been found to be actin-dependent, but the driving force behind this actin cytoskeleton-dependent motion is unclear. Here, we confirmed that the actin-dependent sperm nuclei migration during fertilization is a conserved mechanism in plants. Using in vitro fertilization systems, we showed that a functional actin is also essential in maize and tobacco for sperm nuclei migration after gamete membrane fusion. Cytoskeleton depolymerization inhibitor treatments supported the view that sperm nuclei migration is actin-dependent but microtubule-independent in both egg cell and central cell during double fertilization. We further revealed that the actin-based motor myosin is not the driving force for sperm nuclear migration in maize and tobacco. The WASP-Arp2/3 complex signal cascade is shown here to be involved in the regulation of sperm nuclear migration in maize and tobacco. It is interesting that sperm nuclei migration within somatic cell also need WASP-Arp2/3 complex signal cascade and actin, suggesting that the mechanism of sperm nuclear migration is not gamete specific.
28205154	The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The effector AvrPiz-t of Magnaporthe oryzae has virulence function in rice. However, the mechanism underlying its virulence in host is not fully understood.

RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed the function of AvrPiz-t interacting protein 12 (APIP12) in rice immunity. APIP12 significantly bound to AvrPiz-t and APIP6 in its middle portion and N-terminus, respectively, in yeast two-hybrid assay. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay further verified the interactions of APIP12 with AvrPiz-t and APIP6. APIP12 encodes a homologue of nucleoporin protein Nup98 without the conserved domain of Phe-Gly repeats and has no orthologue in other plants. Both knockout and knockdown of APIP12 caused enhanced susceptibility of rice plants to virulent isolates of M. oryzae. The expression of some pathogenesis-related (PR) genes was reduced in both knockout and knockdown mutants, suggesting that APIP12 is required for the accumulation of transcripts of PR genes upon the infection. It is worth noting that neither knockout/knockdown nor overexpression of APIP12 attenuates Piz-t resistance.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that APIP12 is a virulence target of AvrPiz-t and is involved in the basal resistance against M. oryzae in rice.
28330563	Characterization of the endosperm starch and the pleiotropic effects of biosynthetic enzymes on their properties in novel mutant rice lines with high resistant starch and amylose content.	2017	Plant Sci	Resistant starch (RS) is beneficial to human health. In order to reduce the current prevalence of diabetes and obesity, several transgenic and mutant crops containing high RS content are being developed. RS content of steamed rice with starch-branching enzyme (BE)IIb-deficient mutant endosperms is considerably high. To understand the mechanisms of RS synthesis and to increase RS content, we developed novel mutant rice lines by introducing the gene encoding starch synthase (SS)IIa and/or granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS)I from an indica rice cultivar into a japonica rice-based BEIIb-deficient mutant line, be2b. Introduction of SSIIa from an indica rice cultivar produced higher levels of amylopectin chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 11-18 than those in be2b; the extent of the change was slight due to the shortage of donor chains for SSIIa (DP 6-12) owing to BEIIb deficiency. The introduction of GBSSI from an indica rice cultivar significantly increased amylose content (by approximately 10%) in the endosperm starch. RS content of the new mutant lines was the same as or slightly higher than that of the be2b parent line. The relationship linking starch structure, RS content, and starch biosynthetic enzymes in the new mutant lines has also been discussed.
28202263	Arsenic mobility and bioavailability in paddy soil under iron compound amendments at different growth stages of rice.	2017	Environ Pollut	Iron (Fe)-based solids can reduce arsenic (As) mobility and bioavailability in soils, which has been well recognized. However, to our knowledge, there are few studies on As uptake at different growth stages of rice under Fe compound amendments. In addition, the formation of Fe plaques at different growth stages of rice has also been rarely reported. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate As mobility and bioavailability in paddy soil under Fe compound amendments throughout the whole growth stage of rice plants. Amendments of poorly crystalline Fe oxides (PC-Fe), FeCl2+NaNO3 and FeCl2 reduced grain As by 54% ± 3.0%, 52% ± 3.0% and 46% ± 17%, respectively, compared with that of the non-amended control. The filling stage was suggested to be the key stage to take measures to reduce As uptake. At this stage, all soil amendments significantly reduced As accumulation in rice plants. At the maturation stage, PC-Fe amendment significantly reduced mobile pools and increased immobile pools of soil As. Besides, PC-Fe treatment promoted the transformation of Fe fractions from dissolved Fe to adsorbed, poorly crystalline and free Fe oxides. Moreover, significant positive correlations between soil Fe fractions and As fractions were found. Accordingly, we hypothesized that Fe compound amendments might affect the concentration distribution of Fe fractions first and then affect As fractionation in soil and its bioavailability to rice plants indirectly. The formation of Fe plaques varied with growth stages and different treatments. Significantly negative correlations between mobile pools of As and Fe or As in Fe plaques indicated that Fe plaques could immobilize mobile As in soils and thus affect As bioavailability. Overall, the effect of the soil amendments on reduction of As uptake varied with growth stages and different treatments, and further research on the key stage for reducing As uptake is still required.
28199670	SPL33, encoding an eEF1A-like protein, negatively regulates cell death and defense responses in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Lesion-mimic mutants are useful to dissect programmed cell death and defense-related pathways in plants. Here we identified a new rice lesion-mimic mutant, spotted leaf 33 (spl33) and cloned the causal gene by a map-based cloning strategy. SPL33 encodes a eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A)-like protein consisting of a non-functional zinc finger domain and three functional EF-Tu domains. spl33 exhibited programmed cell death-mediated cell death and early leaf senescence, as evidenced by analyses of four histochemical markers, namely H2O2 accumulation, cell death, callose accumulation and TUNEL-positive nuclei, and by four indicators, namely loss of chlorophyll, breakdown of chloroplasts, down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes, and up-regulation of senescence-associated genes. Defense responses were induced in the spl33 mutant, as shown by enhanced resistance to both the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and by up-regulation of defense response genes. Transcriptome analysis of the spl33 mutant and its wild type provided further evidence for the biological effects of loss of SPL33 function in cell death, leaf senescence and defense responses in rice. Detailed analyses showed that reactive oxygen species accumulation may be the cause of cell death in the spl33 mutant, whereas uncontrolled activation of multiple innate immunity-related receptor genes and signaling molecules may be responsible for the enhanced disease resistance observed in spl33. Thus, we have demonstrated involvement of an eEF1A-like protein in programmed cell death and provided a link to defense responses in rice.
28193162	Genome-wide characterization of JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN transcription repressors in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) repressor family proteins are jasmonate co-receptors and transcriptional repressor in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway, and they play important roles in regulating the growth and development of plants. Recently, more and more researches on JAZ gene family are reported in many plants. Although the genome sequencing of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its relatives is complete, our knowledge about this gene family remains vacant.

RESULTS: Fourteen JAZ genes were identified in the wheat genome. Structural analysis revealed that the TaJAZ proteins in wheat were as conserved as those in other plants, but had structural characteristics. By phylogenetic analysis, all JAZ proteins from wheat and other plants were clustered into 11 sub-groups (G1-G11), and TaJAZ proteins shared a high degree of similarity with some JAZ proteins from Aegliops tauschii, Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa. The Ka/Ks ratios of TaJAZ genes ranged from 0.0016 to 0.6973, suggesting that the TaJAZ family had undergone purifying selection in wheat. Gene expression patterns obtained by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of TaJAZ genes under multifarious abiotic stress treatments of high salinity, drought, cold and phytohormone. Among these, TaJAZ7, 8 and 12 were specifically expressed in the anther tissues of the thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) wheat line BS366 and normal control wheat line Jing411. Compared with the gene expression patterns in the normal wheat line Jing411, TaJAZ7, 8 and 12 had different expression patterns in abnormally dehiscent anthers of BS366 at the heading stage 6, suggesting that specific up- or down-regulation of these genes might be associated with the abnormal anther dehiscence in TGMS wheat line.

CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the size and composition of the JAZ gene family in wheat, and investigated stress responsive and differential tissue-specific expression profiles of each TaJAZ gene in TGMS wheat line BS366. In addition, we isolated 3 TaJAZ genes that would be more likely to be involved in the regulation of abnormal anther dehiscence in TGMS wheat line. In conclusion, the results of this study contributed some novel and detailed information about JAZ gene family in wheat, and also provided 3 potential candidate genes for improving the TGMS wheat line.
28236273	Developmental processes and responses to hormonal stimuli in tea plant (Camellia sinensis) leaves are controlled by GRF and GIF gene families.	2017	Funct Integr Genomics	Tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is an important leaf-type woody crop used for producing of non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. The GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) transcription factors cooperated with GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR (GIF) transcriptional coactivators positively regulate leaf development. In the present study, six GRF and two GIF genes were identified and characterized in the leaf transcriptome of C. sinensis, respectively. The alignment results showed that the feature structures of the predicted homologous GRF and GIF proteins of C. sinensis hold a high identity with Arabidopsis and rice. The presence of C. sinensis miR396 target sites suggested that these miR396 members are the potential post-transcriptional regulators of CsGRF genes. The expression profiles of CsGRF and CsGIF1 genes were higher in tender leaves and consistently downregulated during tea plant leaf development. Those results suggested that these genes may be actively involved in the early stage leaf tissue formation in tea plant. The divergence of CsGRF and CsGIF genes in response to different hormonal stimuli revealed the possible multiple functions of these genes in hormonal regulation. This study provided the potential molecular basis of the CsGRF and CsGIF family genes for future functional research on leaf development and hormonal stimuli in C. sinensis.
28042888	Ratoon rice generated from primed parent plants exhibit enhanced herbivore resistance.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Rice ratooning is practiced in many rice-growing countries for achieving increased rice production with limited labour input. Here, we report that attack by insect herbivores, or treatment with a defense signaling compound in parent plants, can prime anti-herbivore defense responses in subsequent ratoon plants. We compared the defense responses of rice ratoons generated from parent plants that had been either infested by Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (rice leaffolder, LF) caterpillars or treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) during vegetative growth, with ratoons generated from control parent plants. Ratoon plants generated from parents receiving prior LF infestation or MeJA treatment exhibited higher jasmonic acid (JA) levels, as well as elevated levels of transcripts of defense-related genes associated with JA signaling. In addition, elevated activities of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and trypsin protease inhibitor were observed, as well as enhanced resistance towards subsequent LF infestation. Pre-priming of ratoon defense responses was significantly reduced in plants where expression of OsAOS (allene oxide synthase, involved in JA biosynthesis) or OsCOI1 (CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1, involved in JA perception) was inhibited by RNA interference. Our results indicate that herbivore exposure or MeJA treatment in rice parent plants enhances anti-herbivore resistance in subsequently generated ratoons through priming of JA-mediated defenses.
28243987	Differential Regulation of Starch-synthetic Gene Expression in Endosperm Between Indica and Japonica Rice Cultivars.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Grain filling rates (GFRs) of indica rice cultivars are often higher than those of japonica cultivars. Although GFR is mainly determined by the starch accumulation rate (SAR) in endosperm, the genetic basis for SAR during the ripening period has not been well studied in rice. To elucidate the factors influencing the differing SARs between typical indica and japonica cultivars, we focused on differences in sink potentials, especially on starch synthesis in the endosperm.

RESULTS: SAR in indica rice cultivar IR36 was significantly higher than in japonica cultivar T65. Although enzymes for both amylose and amylopectin syntheses had higher activity in IR36, amylopectin synthesis was seemingly more important for accelerating SAR because an elevation of amylose synthesis ability alone in the T65 genetic background did not result in the same level of SAR as IR36. In IR36, most starch-synthetic genes (SSGs) in the endosperm were more highly expressed during ripening than in T65. In panicle culture experiments, the SSGs in rice endosperm were regulated in either sucrose-dependent or -independent manners, or both. All SSGs except SSI and BEIIa were responsive to sucrose in both cultivars, and GBSSI, AGPS2b and PUL were more responsive to sucrose in IR36. Interestingly, the GBSSI gene (Wx a ) in IR36 was highly activated by sucrose, but the GBSSI gene (Wx b ) in T65 was insensitive. In sucrose-independent regulation, AGPL2, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIb and ISA1 genes in IR36 were upregulated 1.5 to 2 times more than those in T65. Additionally, at least SSI and BEIIa might be regulated by unknown signals; that regulation pathway should be more activated in IR36 than T65.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, at least three regulatory pathways seem to be involved in SSG expression in rice endosperm, and all pathways were more active in IR36. One of the factors leading to the high SAR of IR36 seemed to be an increase in the sink potential.
28213905	A ten gene-containing genomic island determines flagellin glycosylation: implication for its regulatory role in motility and virulence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2017	Mol Plant Pathol	Flagellin glycosylation plays a crucial role in flagellar assembly, motility and virulence in several pathogenic bacteria. However, little is known about the genetic determinants and biological functions of flagellin glycosylation in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal pathogen of bacterial blight of rice. Here, the structure, regulation and functions of a ten-gene cluster gigX (glycosylation island genes of Xoo), which was embedded in a flagellar regulon, were characterized. gigX1 to gigX10 encoded putative enzymes or proteins involved in glycan biosynthesis and transfer, including a nucleotide sugar transaminase, an acyl-carrier protein (ACP), a 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase, a 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase, a dehydrogenase, an acetyltransferase, a ring hydroxylating dioxygenase, a hypothetical protein, a methyltransferanse and a glycosyltransferase, respectively. The gigX genes were co-transcribed in an operon and up-regulated by the upstream σ54 factor RpoN2 and transcriptional activator FleQ. In-frame deletion of each gigX gene affected flagellin glycosylation modification, meaning that the unglycosylated flagellin of the mutants was smaller than the glycosylated flagellin of the wild-type. No significant changes in flagellar filament and motility were observed in the ΔgigX mutants, among which only ΔgigX6 displayed increased swimming ability. Importantly, all mutants, except ΔgigX9, showed significantly increased virulence and bacterial growth in the susceptible rice cultivar IR24, and ΔgigX1 and ΔgigX10 showed enhanced type III secretion system (T3SS)-related gene expression. Moreover, the glycosylated flagellin of the wild-type induced higher H2 O2 levels in rice leaves than did the unglycosylated flagellins of ΔgigX1 or ΔgigX10. Taken together, this study reveals that the gigX cluster determines flagellin glycosylation, and implicates the regulatory role of post-translational modification with the glycosylation, acetylation and methylation of flagellin in the regulation of motility and virulence of Xoo.
28282528	Spatio-temporal dynamics in global rice gene expression (Oryza sativa L.) in response to high ammonium stress.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Ammonium (NH4+) is the predominant nitrogen (N) source in many natural and agricultural ecosystems, including flooded rice fields. While rice is known as an NH4+-tolerant species, it nevertheless suffers NH4+ toxicity at elevated soil concentrations. NH4+ excess rapidly leads to the disturbance of various physiological processes that ultimately inhibit shoot and root growth. However, the global transcriptomic response to NH4+ stress in rice has not been examined. In this study, we mapped the spatio-temporal specificity of gene expression profiles in rice under excess NH4+ and the changes in gene expression in root and shoot at various time points by RNA-Seq (Quantification) using Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. By comparative analysis, 307 and 675 genes were found to be up-regulated after 4h and 12h of NH4+ exposure in the root, respectively. In the shoot, 167 genes were up-regulated at 4h, compared with 320 at 12h. According to KEGG analysis, up-regulated DEGs mainly participate in phenylpropanoid (such as flavonoid) and amino acid (such as proline, cysteine, and methionine) metabolism, which is believed to improve NH4+ stress tolerance through adjustment of energy metabolism in the shoot, while defense and signaling pathways, guiding whole-plant acclimation, play the leading role in the root. We furthermore critically assessed the roles of key phytohormones, and found abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene (ET) to be the major regulatory molecules responding to excess NH4+ and activating the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signal-transduction pathway. Moreover, we found up-regulated hormone-associated genes are involved in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis and are regulated by tissue flavonoid accumulation.
28205522	Adaptability of small brown planthopper to four rice cultivars using life table and population projection method.	2017	Sci Rep	In this study, we evaluated the adaptability of the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) to four rice cultivars including Shengdao13 (SD13), Shengdao14 (SD14), Shengdao15 (SD15), and Zixiangnuo (ZXN) using the age-stage, two-sex life table with a simplified method for recording egg production (i.e., every five days vs. daily). The intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the SBPH was the highest (0.1067 d-1) on cultivar SD15, which was similar to the rate on SD14 (0.1029 d-1), but was significantly higher than that occurring on ZXN (0.0897 d-1) and SD13 (0.0802 d-1). The differences of the finite rate of increase (λ) on the four rice cultivars were consistent with the r values. Population projection predicted an explosive population growth of the SBPH occurring in a relatively short time when reared on SD14 and SD15. These findings demonstrated that the SBPH can successfully survive on the four rice cultivars, although there were varying host adaptabilities.
28205641	The tiered-evaluation of the effects of transgenic cry1c rice on Cyrtorhinus lividipennis, a main predator of Nilaparvata lugens.	2017	Sci Rep	T1C-19, a newly developed transgenic cry1C rice line, expresses cry1C under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter, and is highly resistant to lepidopteran pests of rice. Cyrtorhinus lividipennis is the major predator of the eggs and young nymphs of Nilaparvata lugens, which is the main non-target sap-sucking insect pest of Bt rice. C. lividipennis may be exposed to Cry1C protein, thus biosafety evaluations of transgenic cry1C rice on C. lividipennis should be conducted before the commercialization of T1C-19. In the current study, we tested the direct toxicity of elevated doses of Cry1C to C. lividipennis, effects of T1C-19 on the life-table parameters of C. lividipennis via preying planthoppers, and effects of T1C-19 on the population density and dynamics in rice fields. No detrimental effects on development, survival, female ratio and body weight of C. lividipennis were caused by direct exposure to elevated doses of the Cry1C protein or prey-mediated exposure to realistic doses of the protein. The population density and dynamics did not significantly differ between C. lividipennis in T1C-19 and non-transgenic rice fields. Thus, transgenic cry1C rice had no negative effects on C. lividipennis. This is the first report of the effects of transgenic cry1C rice on C. lividipennis.
28211909	A CRISPR-Cpf1 system for efficient genome editing and transcriptional repression in plants.	2017	Nat Plants	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cpf1 has emerged as an effective genome editing tool in animals. Here we compare the activity of Cpf1 from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 (As) and Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (Lb) in plants, using a dual RNA polymerase II promoter expression system. LbCpf1 generated biallelic mutations at nearly 100% efficiency at four independent sites in rice T0 transgenic plants. Moreover, we repurposed AsCpf1 and LbCpf1 for efficient transcriptional repression in Arabidopsis, and demonstrated a more than tenfold reduction in miR159b transcription. Our data suggest promising applications of CRISPR-Cpf1 for editing plant genomes and modulating the plant transcriptome.
28170228	A Pair of Residues That Interactively Affect Diterpene Synthase Product Outcome.	2017	ACS Chem Biol	The labdane-related diterpenoids (LRDs) are an important superfamily of natural products whose structural diversity critically depends on the hydrocarbon skeletal structures generated, in large part, by class I diterpene synthases. In the plant kingdom, where the LRDs are predominantly found, the relevant class I diterpene synthases are clearly derived from the ent-kaurene synthase (KS) required in all land plants for phytohormone biosynthesis and, hence, are often termed KS-like (KSL). Previous work, initiated by the distinct function of two alleles of a KSL from rice, OsKSL5, identified a single residue switch with a profound effect on not only OsKSL5 product outcome but also that of land plant KSs more broadly, specifically, replacement of a key isoleucine with threonine, which interrupts formation of the tetracyclic ent-isokaurene at the tricyclic stage, leading to production of ent-pimaradiene instead. Here, further studies of these alleles led to discovery of another, nearby residue that tunes product outcome. Substitution for this newly identified residue is additionally shown to exert an epistatic effect in KSs, altering product distribution only if combined with replacement of the key isoleucine. On the other hand, this pair of residues was found to exert additive effects on the product outcome mediated by distantly related KSLs from the eudicot castor bean. Accordingly, it was possible to use a rational combination of substitutions for this pair of residues to engineer significantly increased (dominant) selectivity for novel 8α-hydroxy-ent-pimar-15-ene product outcome in the KS from the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrating the utility of these results.
28238020	Haploid embryo production in rice and maize induced by PsASGR-BBML transgenes.	2017	Plant Reprod	KEY MESSAGE: The PsASGR - BBML transgene, derived from a wild apomictic grass species, can induce parthenogenesis, embryo formation without fertilization, in rice and maize, leading to the formation of haploid plants. The ability to engineer apomictic crop plants using genes identified from naturally occurring apomicts will depend on the ability of those genes to function in crop plants. The PsASGR-BBML transgene, derived from the apomictic species Pennisetum squamulatum, promotes parthenogenesis in sexual pearl millet, a member of the same genus, leading to the formation of haploid embryos. This study determined that the PsASGR-BBML transgene can induce haploid embryo development in two major monocot crops, maize and rice. Transgene variations tested included two different promoters and the use of both genomic and cDNA PsASGR-BBML-derived sequences. Haploid plants were recovered from mature caryopses (seed) of rice and maize lines at variable rates. The PsASGR-BBML transgenes failed to induce measurable haploid seed development in the model genetic plant system Arabidopsis thaliana. Complexity of embryo development, as documented in transgenic rice lines, identifies the need for further characterization of the PsASGR-BBML gene.
28371690	A protective role for nitric oxide and salicylic acid for arsenite phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Nitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA) are important signaling molecules in plant system. In the present study both NO and SA showed a protective role against arsenite (AsIII) stress in rice plants when supplied exogenously. The application of NO and SA alleviated the negative impact of AsIII on plant growth. Nitric oxide supplementation to AsIII treated plants greatly decreased arsenic (As) accumulation in the roots as well as shoots/roots translocation factor. Arsenite exposure in plants decreased the endogenous levels of NO and SA. Exogenous supplementation of SA not only enhanced endogenous level of SA but also the level of NO through enhanced nitrate reductase (NR) activity, whether AsIII was present or not. Exogenously supplied NO decreased the NR activity and level of endogenous NO. Arsenic accumulation was positively correlated with the expression level of OsLsi1, a transporter responsible for AsIII uptake. The endogenous level of NO and SA were positively correlated to each other either when AsIII was present or not. This close relationship indicates that NO and SA work in harmony to modulate the signaling response in AsIII stressed plants.
28169454	Toxicity of sulfide to early life stages of wild rice (Zizania palustris).	2017	Environ Toxicol Chem	The sensitivity of wild rice (Zizania palustris) to sulfide is not well understood. Because sulfate in surface waters is reduced to sulfide by anaerobic bacteria in sediments and historical information indicated that 10 mg/L sulfate in Minnesota (USA) surface water reduced Z. palustris abundance, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency established 10 mg/L sulfate as a water quality criterion in 1973. A 21-d daily-renewal hydroponic study was conducted to evaluate sulfide toxicity to wild rice and the potential mitigation of sulfide toxicity by iron (Fe). The hydroponic design used hypoxic test media for seed and root exposure and aerobic headspace for the vegetative portion of the plant. Test concentrations were 0.3, 1.6, 3.1, 7.8, and 12.5 mg/L sulfide in test media with 0.8, 2.8, and 10.8 mg/L total Fe used to evaluate the impact of iron on sulfide toxicity. Visual assessments (i.e., no plants harvested) of seed activation, mesocotyl emergence, seedling survival, and phytoxicity were conducted 10 d after dark-phase exposure. Each treatment was also evaluated for time to 30% emergence (ET30), total plant biomass, root and shoot lengths, and signs of phytotoxicity at study conclusion (21 d). The results indicate that exposure of developing wild rice to sulfide at ≥3.1 mg sulfide/L in the presence of 0.8 mg/L Fe reduced mesocotyl emergence. Sulfide toxicity was mitigated by the addition of Fe at 2.8 mg/L and 10.8 mg/L relative to the control value of 0.8 mg Fe/L, demonstrating the importance of iron in mitigating sulfide toxicity to wild rice. Ultimately, determination of site-specific sulfate criteria taking into account factors that alter toxicity, including sediment Fe and organic carbon, are necessary.

28168155	Diversity-Oriented Synthesis of Natural-Product-like Libraries Containing a 3-Methylbenzofuran Moiety for the Discovery of New Chemical Elicitors.	2017	ChemistryOpen	Natural products are a major source of biological molecules. The 3-methylfuran scaffold is found in a variety of plant secondary metabolite chemical elicitors that confer host-plant resistance against insect pests. Herein, the diversity-oriented synthesis of a natural-product-like library is reported, in which the 3-methylfuran core is fused in an angular attachment to six common natural product scaffolds-coumarin, chalcone, flavone, flavonol, isoflavone and isoquinolinone. The structural diversity of this library is assessed computationally using cheminformatic analysis. Phenotypic high-throughput screening of β-glucuronidase activity uncovers several hits. Further in vivo screening confirms that these hits can induce resistance in rice to nymphs of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. This work validates the combination of diversity-oriented synthesis and high-throughput screening of β-glucuronidase activity as a strategy for discovering new chemical elicitors.

28192204	Analysis of plant UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM): Role of divalent metals and structure prediction.	2017	Biochim Biophys Acta	UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM) is a plant enzyme which interconverts UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap; a six-membered sugar) to UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf; a five-membered sugar). Plant mutases belong to a small gene family called Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). So far, UAM has been identified in Oryza sativa (Rice), Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare (Barley). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Here, the divalent metal ion dependency of UAMs from O. sativa (rice) and A. thaliana have been studied using HPLC-based kinetic assays. It was determined that UAM from these species had the highest relative activity in a range of 40-80μM Mn2+. Excess Mn2+ ion concentration decreased the enzyme activity. This trend was observed when other divalent metal ions were used to test activity. To gain a perspective of the role played by the metal ion in activity, an ab initio structural model was generated based on the UAM amino acid sequence and a potential metal binding region was identified. Based on our results, we propose that the probable role of the metal in UAM is stabilizing the diphosphate of the substrate, UDP-Arap.
28212609	Exogenous glutamate rapidly induces the expression of genes involved in metabolism and defense responses in rice roots.	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Glutamate is an active amino acid. In addition to protein synthesis and metabolism, increasing evidence indicates that glutamate may also function as a signaling molecule in plants. Still, little is known about the nutritional role of glutamate and genes that are directly regulated by glutamate in rice.

RESULTS: Exogenous glutamate could serve as a nitrogen nutrient to support the growth of rice seedlings, but it was not as effective as ammonium nitrate or glutamine. In nitrogen-starved rice seedlings, glutamate was the most abundant free amino acid and feeding of glutamate rapidly and significantly increased the endogenous levels of glutamine, but not glutamate. These results indicated that glutamate was quickly metabolized and converted to the other nitrogen-containing compounds in rice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that at least 122 genes involved in metabolism, transport, signal transduction, and stress responses in the roots were rapidly induced by 2.5 mM glutamate within 30 min. Many of these genes were also up-regulated by glutamine and ammonium nitrate. Still, we were able to identify some transcription factor, kinase/phosphatase, and elicitor-responsive genes that were specifically or preferentially induced by glutamate.

CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate is a functional amino acid that plays important roles in plant nutrition, metabolism, and signal transduction. The rapid and specific induction of transcription factor, kinase/phosphatase and elicitor-responsive genes suggests that glutamate may efficiently amplify its signal and interact with other signaling pathways to regulate metabolism, growth and defense responses in rice.
28163300	Identification of two novel Rhizoctonia solani-inducible cis-acting elements in the promoter of the maize gene, GRMZM2G315431.	2017	Sci Rep	Plants are continuously exposed to myriad pathogen stresses. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these stress signals are perceived and transduced are poorly understood. In this study, the maize gene GRMZM2G315431 was identified to be highly inducible by Rhizoctonia solani infection, suggesting that the promoter of GRMZM2G315431 (pGRMZM2G315431) might contain a specific cis-acting element responsive to R. solani attack. To identify the R. solani-responsive element in pGRMZM2G315431, a series of binary plant transformation vectors were constructed by fusing pGRMZM2G315431 or its deletion-derivatives with the reporter genes. In the transient gene expression system of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves inoculated with R. solani, GUS quantification suggested that the DNA fragment contains the unknown pathogen-inducible cis-elements in the -1323 to -1212 region. Furthermore, detailed quantitative assays showed that two novel cis-elements, GTTGA in the -1243 to -1239 region and TATTT in the -1232 to -1228 region, were responsible for the R. solani-inducible activity. These two cis-elements were also identified to have R. solani-specific-inducible activity in stable transgenic rice plants, suggesting the existence of a novel regulation mechanism involved in the interaction between R. solani and Zea mays.
28082603	Analysis of Three Sugarcane Homo/Homeologous Regions Suggests Independent Polyploidization Events of Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum.	2017	Genome Biol Evol	Whole genome duplication has played an important role in plant evolution and diversification. Sugarcane is an important crop with a complex hybrid polyploid genome, for which the process of adaptation to polyploidy is still poorly understood. In order to improve our knowledge about sugarcane genome evolution and the homo/homeologous gene expression balance, we sequenced and analyzed 27 BACs (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) of sugarcane R570 cultivar, containing the putative single-copy genes LFY (seven haplotypes), PHYC (four haplotypes), and TOR (seven haplotypes). Comparative genomic approaches showed that these sugarcane loci presented a high degree of conservation of gene content and collinearity (synteny) with sorghum and rice orthologous regions, but were invaded by transposable elements (TE). All the homo/homeologous haplotypes of LFY, PHYC, and TOR are likely to be functional, because they are all under purifying selection (dN/dS ≪ 1). However, they were found to participate in a nonequivalently manner to the overall expression of the corresponding gene. SNPs, indels, and amino acid substitutions allowed inferring the S. officinarum or S. spontaneum origin of the TOR haplotypes, which further led to the estimation that these two sugarcane ancestral species diverged between 2.5 and 3.5 Ma. In addition, analysis of shared TE insertions in TOR haplotypes suggested that two autopolyploidization may have occurred in the lineage that gave rise to S. officinarum, after its divergence from S. spontaneum.
28461723	Genome-wide analysis and expression patterns of the NAC transcription factor family in <i>Medicago truncatula</i>.	2017	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	NAC transcription factor (TF) family proteins are expressed in various developmental stages and following various stresses. NAC TFs are involved in mediating various physiological functions of plants and participate in various signaling pathways under biotic or abiotic stress. The present study provided a comprehensive functional analysis of members of the MtNAC TF family. Via screening of Medicago truncatula genome information, we identified 97 MtNAC TFs in M. truncatula and compared the phylogenetic analysis of 14 conserved groups with their Arabidopsis and rice counterparts. The NAC TFs were categorized into 14 groups based on their conserved motifs and gene structure. The predicted M. truncatula NAC genes were distributed among eight chromosomes, and in addition, we found that these genes showed mass gene duplication. Through expression profiling of RNA-seq data analysis, we determined that NAC family members were expressed significantly under different abiotic stresses. This indicates that the NAC TF shows different functions in M. truncatula. Together, this genome-wide analysis of the NAC gene family in M. truncatula, could be applied to improving stress tolerance in plants.
28251460	Characterization of a disease susceptibility locus for exploring an efficient way to improve rice resistance against bacterial blight.	2017	Sci China Life Sci	Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the most harmful bacterial disease of rice worldwide. Previously, we characterized major disease resistance (MR) gene xa25, which confers race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339. The xa25 is a recessive allele of the SWEET13 locus, but SWEET13's interaction with PXO339 and how efficiently using this locus for rice breeding still need to be defined. Here we show that the SWEET13 allele from rice Zhenshan 97 is a susceptibility gene to PXO339. Using this allele's promoter to regulate xa25 resulted in disease, suggesting that the promoter is a key determinant in SWEET13 caused disease in Zhanshan 97 after PXO339 infection. PXO339 transcriptionally induces SWEET13 to cause disease. Partial suppressing SWEET13 expression leads to a high level of resistance to PXO339. Thus, the transcriptionally suppressed SWEET13 functions as xa25 in resistance to PXO339. Hybrid rice is widely grown in many countries. However, recessive MR genes have not been efficiently used for disease resistance breeding in hybrid rice production for both parents of the hybrid have to carry the same recessive gene. However, the suppressed SWEET13 functions dominantly, which will have advantage to improve the resistance of hybrid rice to xa25-incomptible Xoo.
28087829	Tracheophytes Contain Conserved Orthologs of a Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor That Modulate <i>ROOT HAIR SPECIFIC</i> Genes.	2017	Plant Cell	ROOT HAIR SPECIFIC (RHS) genes, which contain the root hair-specific cis-element (RHE) in their regulatory regions, function in root hair morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that an Arabidopsis thaliana basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, ROOT HAIR DEFECTVE SIX-LIKE4 (RSL4), directly binds to the RHE in vitro and in vivo, upregulates RHS genes, and stimulates root hair formation in Arabidopsis. Orthologs of RSL4 from a eudicot (poplar [Populus trichocarpa]), a monocot (rice [Oryza sativa]), and a lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii) each restored root hair growth in the Arabidopsis rsl4 mutant. In addition, the rice and S. moellendorffii RSL4 orthologs bound to the RHE in in vitro and in vivo assays. The RSL4 orthologous genes contain RHEs in their promoter regions, and RSL4 was able to bind to its own RHEs in vivo and amplify its own expression. This process likely provides a positive feedback loop for sustainable root hair growth. When RSL4 and its orthologs were expressed in cells in non-root-hair positions, they induced ectopic root hair growth, indicating that these genes are sufficient to specify root hair formation. Our results suggest that RSL4 mediates root hair formation by regulating RHS genes and that this mechanism is conserved throughout the tracheophyte (vascular plant) lineage.
28082384	The Rice Receptor-Like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization during Reproductive Development.	2017	Plant Cell	Cell-to-cell communication precisely controls the creation of new organs during reproductive growth. However, the sensor molecules that mediate developmental signals in monocot plants are poorly understood. Here, we report that DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 (DRUS1) and DRUS2, two closely related receptor-like kinases (RLKs), redundantly control reproductive growth and development in rice (Oryza sativa). A drus1-1 drus2 double knockout mutant, but not either single mutant, showed extreme dwarfism and barren inflorescences that harbored sterile spikelets. The gibberellin pathway was not impaired in this mutant. A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins. DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion. In the later stages of anther development, survival of the endothecium requires DRUS1/2, which may stimulate expression of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene UGP2 and starch biosynthesis in pollen. Unlike their Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog FERONIA, DRUS1 and 2 mediate a fundamental signaling process that is essential for cell survival and represents a novel biological function for the CrRLK1L RLK subfamily.
28100707	The RLA1/SMOS1 Transcription Factor Functions with OsBZR1 to Regulate Brassinosteroid Signaling and Rice Architecture.	2017	Plant Cell	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant-specific steroid hormones that control plant growth and development. Recent studies have identified key components of the BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana and in rice (Oryza sativa); however, the mechanism of BR signaling in rice, especially downstream of GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), remains unclear. Here, we identified a BR-insensitive rice mutant, reduced leaf angle1 (rla1), and cloned the corresponding gene. RLA1 was identical to the previously reported SMALL ORGAN SIZE1 (SMOS1), which was cloned from another allele. RLA1/SMOS1 encodes a transcription factor with an APETALA2 DNA binding domain. Genetic analysis indicated that RLA1/SMOS1 functions as a positive regulator in the BR signaling pathway and is required for the function of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1). In addition, RLA1/SMOS1 can interact with OsBZR1 to enhance its transcriptional activity. GSK2 can interact with and phosphorylate RLA1/SMOS1 to reduce its stability. These results demonstrate that RLA1/SMOS1 acts as an integrator of the transcriptional complex directly downstream of GSK2 and plays an essential role in BR signaling and plant development in rice.
28087830	Recognition of the <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Effector AVR-Pia by the Decoy Domain of the Rice NLR Immune Receptor RGA5.	2017	Plant Cell	Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs) are important receptors in plant immunity that allow recognition of pathogen effectors. The rice (Oryza sativa) NLR RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia through direct interaction. Here, we gained detailed insights into the molecular and structural bases of AVR-Pia-RGA5 interaction and the role of the RATX1 decoy domain of RGA5. NMR titration combined with in vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction analyses identified the AVR-Pia interaction surface that binds to the RATX1 domain. Structure-informed AVR-Pia mutants showed that, although AVR-Pia associates with additional sites in RGA5, binding to the RATX1 domain is necessary for pathogen recognition but can be of moderate affinity. Therefore, RGA5-mediated resistance is highly resilient to mutations in the effector. We propose a model that explains such robust effector recognition as a consequence, and an advantage, of the combination of integrated decoy domains with additional independent effector-NLR interactions.
28100706	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	Cullin3-based RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL3), composed of Cullin3 (CUL3), RBX1, and BTB proteins, are involved in plant immunity, but the function of CUL3 in the process is largely unknown. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) OsCUL3a is important for the regulation of cell death and immunity. The rice lesion mimic mutant oscul3a displays a significant increase in the accumulation of flg22- and chitin-induced reactive oxygen species, and in pathogenesis-related gene expression as well as resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. We cloned the OsCUL3a gene via a map-based strategy and found that the lesion mimic phenotype of oscul3a is associated with the early termination of OsCUL3a protein. Interaction assays showed that OsCUL3a interacts with both OsRBX1a and OsRBX1b to form a multisubunit CRL in rice. Strikingly, OsCUL3a interacts with and degrades OsNPR1, which acts as a positive regulator of cell death in rice. Accumulation of OsNPR1 protein is greater in the oscul3a mutant than in the wild type. Furthermore, the oscul3a osnpr1 double mutant does not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the oscul3a mutant. Our data demonstrate that OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice.
28082511	Glycerol-3-Phosphate Acyltransferase 3 (OsGPAT3) is required for anther development and male fertility in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Lipid molecules are key structural components of plant male reproductive organs, such as the anther and pollen. Although advances have been made in the understanding of acyl lipids in plant reproduction, the metabolic pathways of other lipid compounds, particularly glycerolipids, are not fully understood. Here we report that an endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme, Glycerol-3-Phosphate Acyltransferase 3 (OsGPAT3), plays an indispensable role in anther development and pollen formation in rice. OsGPAT3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores of the anther. Compared with wild-type plants, the osgpat3 mutant displays smaller, pale yellow anthers with defective anther cuticle, degenerated pollen with defective exine, and abnormal tapetum development and degeneration. Anthers of the osgpat3 mutant have dramatic reductions of all aliphatic lipid contents. The defective cuticle and pollen phenotype coincide well with the down-regulation of sets of genes involved in lipid metabolism and regulation of anther development. Taking these findings together, this work reveals the indispensable role of a monocot-specific glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in male reproduction in rice.
28146098	Comprehensive Analysis of Rice Laccase Gene (OsLAC) Family and Ectopic Expression of OsLAC10 Enhances Tolerance to Copper Stress in Arabidopsis.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Laccases are encoded by a multigene family and widely distributed in plant genomes where they play roles oxidizing monolignols to produce higher-order lignin involved in plant development and stress responses. We identified 30 laccase genes (OsLACs) from rice, which can be divided into five subfamilies, mostly expressed during early development of the endosperm, growing roots, and stems. OsLACs can be induced by hormones, salt, drought, and heavy metals stresses. The expression level of OsLAC10 increased 1200-fold after treatment with 20 μM Cu for 12 h. The laccase activities of OsLAC10 were confirmed in an Escherichia coli expression system. Lignin accumulation increased in the roots of Arabidopsis over-expressing OsLAC10 (OsLAC10-OX) compared to wild-type controls. After growth on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing toxic levels of Cu for seven days, roots of the OsLAC10-OX lines were significantly longer than those of the wild type. Compared to control plants, the Cu concentration decreased significantly in roots of the OsLAC10-OX line under hydroponic conditions. These results provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and functional divergence of OsLAC family. In addition, OsLAC10 is likely involved in lignin biosynthesis, and reduces the uptake of Cu into roots required for Arabidopsis to develop tolerance to Cu.
28079456	Overexpression of TIFY genes promotes plant growth in rice through jasmonate signaling.	2017	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Because environmental stress can reduce crop growth and yield, the identification of genes that enhance agronomic traits is increasingly important. Previous screening of full-length cDNA overexpressing (FOX) rice lines revealed that OsTIFY11b, one of 20 TIFY proteins in rice, affects plant size, grain weight, and grain size. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of OsTIFY11b and nine other TIFY genes on the growth and yield of corresponding TIFY-FOX lines. Regardless of temperature, grain weight and culm length were enhanced in lines overexpressing TIFY11 subfamily genes, except OsTIFY11e. The TIFY-FOX plants exhibited increased floret number and reduced days to flowering, as well as reduced spikelet fertility, and OsTIFY10b, in particular, enhanced grain yield by minimizing decreases in fertility. We suggest that the enhanced growth of TIFY-transgenic rice is related to regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway, as in Arabidopsis. Moreover, we discuss the potential application of TIFY overexpression for improving crop yield.
28111288	OsCERK1-Mediated Chitin Perception and Immune Signaling Requires Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase 185 to Activate an MAPK Cascade in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	Conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as chitin, are perceived by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located at the host cell surface and trigger rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which are required for plant resistance to pathogens. However, the direct links from PAMP perception to MAPK activation in plants remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that the PRR-associated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase Oryza sativa RLCK185 transmits immune signaling from the PAMP receptor OsCERK1 to an MAPK signaling cascade through interaction with an MAPK kinase kinase, OsMAPKKKε, which is the initial kinase of the MAPK cascade. OsRLCK185 interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory domain of OsMAPKKKε. Coexpression of phosphomimetic OsRLCK185 and OsMAPKKKε activates MAPK3/6 phosphorylation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Moreover, OsMAPKKKε interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4, a key MAPK kinase that transduces the chitin signal. Overexpression of OsMAPKKKε increases chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation, whereas OsMAPKKKε knockdown compromises chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation and resistance to rice blast fungus. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of a phospho-signaling pathway from cell surface chitin perception to intracellular activation of an MAPK cascade in rice.
28344585	Ectopic Expression of <i>OsSta2</i> Enhances Salt Stress Tolerance in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Salt stress can severely reduce crop yields. To understand how rice (Oryza sativa) plants respond to this environmental challenge, we investigated the genes involved in conferring salt tolerance by screening T-DNA tagging lines and identified OsSta2-D (Oryza sativa Salt tolerance activation 2-Dominant). In that line, expression of OsSta2 was enhanced by approximately eightfold when compared with the non-transformed wild type (WT). This gene was highly expressed in the callus, roots, and panicles. To confirm its role in stress tolerance, we generated transgenic rice that over-expresses OsSta2 under a maize ubiquitin promoter. The OsSta2-Ox plants were salt-tolerant at the vegetative stage, based on our calculations of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), fresh and dry weights, chlorophyll concentrations, and survival rates. Under normal paddy field conditions, the Ox plants were somewhat shorter than the WT control but had improved agronomic traits such as higher total grain yield. They were also more tolerant to osmotic stress and hypersensitive to abscisic acid. Based on all of these results, we suggest that OsSta2 has important roles in determining yields as well as in conferring tolerance to salt stresses.
28278216	A new transgenic rice line exhibiting enhanced ferric iron reduction and phytosiderophore production confers tolerance to low iron availability in calcareous soil.	2017	PLoS One	Iron (Fe) deficiency is a critical agricultural problem, especially in calcareous soil, which is distributed worldwide. Rice plants take up Fe(II) from soil through a OsIRT1 transporter (Strategy I-related system) and also take up Fe(III) via a phytosiderophore-based system (Strategy II system). However, rice plants are susceptible to low-Fe conditions because they have low Fe(III) reduction activity and low-level phytosiderophore secretion. Previously, we produced transgenic rice plants expressing a mutationally reconstructed yeast ferric chelate reductase, refre1/372, under the control of the OsIRT1 promoter. This transgenic rice line exhibited higher Fe(III) chelate reductase activity and tolerance to Fe deficiency. In addition, we produced transgenic rice overexpressing the Fe deficiency-inducible transcription factor, OsIRO2, which regulates the expression of various genes involved in the strategy II Fe(III) uptake system, including OsNAS1, OsNAAT1, OsDMAS1, OsYSL15, and TOM1. This transgenic rice exhibited improved phytosiderophore secretion ability and tolerance to Fe deficiency. In the present research, transgenic rice plants that possess both the OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 and the 35S promoter-OsIRO2 (RI lines) were produced to enhance both Strategy I Fe(II) reductase ability and Strategy II phytosiderophore productivity. RI lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to Fe-deficient conditions at the early and middle-late stages of growth in calcareous soil, compared to both the non-transgenic line and lines harboring either OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 or 35S promoter-OsIRO2 alone. RI lines also exhibited a 9-fold higher yield than the non-transgenic line. Moreover, we successfully produced Fe-deficiency-tolerant Tachisugata rice, which is a high-biomass variety used as fodder. Collectively, our results demonstrate that combined enhancement of two Fe uptake systems in rice is highly effective in conferring tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soil.
28069545	SMALL ORGAN SIZE 1 and SMALL ORGAN SIZE 2/DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING Form a Complex to Integrate Auxin and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	Although auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) synergistically control various plant responses, the molecular mechanism underlying the auxin-BR crosstalk is not well understood. We previously identified SMOS1, an auxin-regulated APETALA2-type transcription factor, as the causal gene of the small organ size 1 (smos1) mutant that is characterized by a decreased final size of various organs in rice. In this study, we identified another smos mutant, smos2, which shows the phenotype indistinguishable from smos1. SMOS2 was identical to the previously reported DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT), which encodes a GRAS protein involved in BR signaling. SMOS1 and SMOS2/DLT physically interact to cooperatively enhance transcriptional transactivation activity in yeast and in rice nuclei. Consistently, the expression of OsPHI-1, a direct target of SMOS1, is upregulated only when SMOS1 and SMOS2/DLT proteins are both present in rice cells. Taken together, our results suggest that SMOS1 and SMOS2/DLT form a keystone complex on auxin-BR signaling crosstalk in rice.
28326089	Dynamic Regulation of Auxin Response during Rice Development Revealed by Newly Established Hormone Biosensor Markers.	2017	Front Plant Sci	The hormone auxin is critical for many plant developmental processes. Unlike the model eudicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), auxin distribution and signaling in rice tissues has not been systematically investigated due to the absence of suitable auxin response reporters. In this study we observed the conservation of auxin signaling components between Arabidopsis and model monocot crop rice (Oryza sativa), and generated complementary types of auxin biosensor constructs, one derived from the Aux/IAA-based biosensor DII-VENUS but constitutively driven by maize ubiquitin-1 promoter, and the other termed DR5-VENUS in which a synthetic auxin-responsive promoter (DR5rev ) was used to drive expression of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Using the obtained transgenic lines, we observed that during the vegetative development, accumulation of DR5-VENUS signal was at young and mature leaves, tiller buds and stem base. Notably, abundant DR5-VENUS signals were observed in the cytoplasm of cortex cells surrounding lateral root primordia (LRP) in rice. In addition, auxin maxima and dynamic re-localization were seen at the initiation sites of inflorescence and spikelet primordia including branch meristems (BMs), female and male organs. The comparison of these observations among Arabidopsis, rice and maize suggests the unique role of auxin in regulating rice lateral root emergence and reproduction. Moreover, protein localization of auxin transporters PIN1 homologs and GFP tagged OsAUX1 overlapped with DR5-VENUS during spikelet development, helping validate these auxin response reporters are reliable markers in rice. This work firstly reveals the direct correspondence between auxin distribution and rice reproductive and root development at tissue and cellular level, and provides high-resolution auxin tools to probe fundamental developmental processes in rice and to establish links between auxin, development and agronomical traits like yield or root architecture.
28117552	OsCESA9 conserved-site mutation leads to largely enhanced plant lodging resistance and biomass enzymatic saccharification by reducing cellulose DP and crystallinity in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Genetic modification of plant cell walls has been posed to reduce lignocellulose recalcitrance for enhancing biomass saccharification. Since cellulose synthase (CESA) gene was first identified, several dozen CESA mutants have been reported, but almost all mutants exhibit the defective phenotypes in plant growth and development. In this study, the rice (Oryza sativa) Osfc16 mutant with substitutions (W481C, P482S) at P-CR conserved site in CESA9 shows a slightly affected plant growth and higher biomass yield by 25%-41% compared with wild type (Nipponbare, a japonica variety). Chemical and ultrastructural analyses indicate that Osfc16 has a significantly reduced cellulose crystallinity (CrI) and thinner secondary cell walls compared with wild type. CESA co-IP detection, together with implementations of a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) and two distinct cellulose inhibitors (Calcofluor, CGA), shows that CESA9 mutation could affect integrity of CESA4/7/9 complexes, which may lead to rapid CESA proteasome degradation for low-DP cellulose biosynthesis. These may reduce cellulose CrI, which improves plant lodging resistance, a major and integrated agronomic trait on plant growth and grain production, and enhances biomass enzymatic saccharification by up to 2.3-fold and ethanol productivity by 34%-42%. This study has for the first time reported a direct modification for the low-DP cellulose production that has broad applications in biomass industries.
28163713	Homologous U-box E3 Ubiquitin Ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 Are Involved in the Positive Regulation of Low Temperature Stress Response in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice U-box E3 Ub ligases (OsPUBs) are implicated in biotic stress responses. However, their cellular roles in response to abiotic stress are poorly understood. In this study, we performed functional analyses of two homologous OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 in response to cold stress (4°C). OsPUB2 was up-regulated by high salinity, drought, and cold, whereas OsPUB3 was constitutively expressed. A subcellular localization assay revealed that OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 were localized to the exocyst positive organelle (EXPO)-like punctate structures. OsPUB2 was also localized to the nuclei. OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 formed a hetero-dimeric complex as well as homo-dimers in yeast cells and in vitro. OsPUB2/OsPUB3 exhibited self-ubiquitination activities in vitro and were rapidly degraded in the cell-free extracts with apparent half-lives of 150-160 min. This rapid degradation of OsPUB2/OsPUB3 was delayed in the presence of the crude extracts of cold-treated seedlings (apparent half-lives of 200-280 min). Moreover, a hetero-dimeric form of OsPUB2/OsPUB3 was more stable than the homo-dimers. These results suggested that OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 function coordinately in response to cold stress. OsPUB2- and OsPUB3-overexpressing transgenic rice plants showed markedly better tolerance to cold stress than did the wild-type plants in terms of survival rates, chlorophyll content, ion leakage, and expression levels of cold stress-inducible marker genes. Taken together, these results suggested that the two homologous rice U-box E3 Ub ligases OsPUB2 and OsPUB3 are positive regulators of the response to cold stress.
28054650	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	2017	Sci Rep	Starch is the main storage carbohydrate in higher plants. Although several enzymes and regulators for starch biosynthesis have been characterized, a complete regulatory network for starch synthesis in cereal seeds remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the rice Brittle1 (OsBT1) gene, which is expressed specifically in the developing endosperm. The osbt1 mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type. The formation and development of compound starch granules in osbt1 was obviously defective: the amyloplast was disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were disperse and not compound in the endosperm cells in the centre region of osbt1 seeds. The total starch content and amylose content was decreased and the physicochemical properties of starch were altered. Moreover, the degree of polymerization (DP) of amylopectin in osbt1 was remarkably different from that of wild-type. Map-based cloning of OsBT1 indicated that it encodes a putatively ADP-glucose transporter. OsBT1 coded protein localizes in the amyloplast envelope membrane. Furthermore, the expression of starch synthesis related genes was also altered in the osbt1 mutant. These findings indicate that OsBT1 plays an important role in starch synthesis and the formation of compound starch granules.
28424709	Evolutionary Analysis of Snf1-Related Protein Kinase2 (SnRK2) and Calcium Sensor (SCS) Gene Lineages, and Dimerization of Rice Homologs, Suggest Deep Biochemical Conservation across Angiosperms.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Members of the sucrose non-fermenting related kinase Group2 (SnRK2) subclasses are implicated in both direct and indirect abscisic acid (ABA) response pathways. We have used phylogenetic, biochemical, and transient in vivo approaches to examine interactions between Triticum tauschii protein kinase 1 (TtPK1) and an interacting protein, Oryza sativa SnRK2-calcium sensor (OsSCS1). Given that TtPK1 has 100% identity with its rice ortholog, osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase (OsSAPK2), we hypothesized that the SCS and TtPK1 interactions are present in both wheat and rice. Here, we show that SnRK2s are clearly divided into four pan-angiosperm clades with those in the traditionally defined Subclass II encompassing two distinct clades (OsSAPK1/2 and OsSAPK3), although OsSAPK3 lacks an Arabidopsis ortholog. We also show that SCSs are distinct from a second lineage, that we term SCSsister, and while both clades pre-date land plants, the SCSsister clade lacks Poales representatives. Our Y2H assays revealed that the removal of the OsSCS1 C-terminal region along with its N-terminal EF-hand abolished its interaction with the kinase. Using transient in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, we demonstrate that TtPK1/OsSCS1 dimerization co-localizes with DAPI-stained nuclei and with FM4-64-stained membranes. Finally, OsSCS1- and OsSAPK2-hybridizing transcripts co-accumulate in shoots/coleoptile of drying seedlings, consistent with up-regulated kinase transcripts of PKABA1 and TtPK1. Our studies suggest that interactions between homologs of the SnRK2 and SCS lineages are broadly conserved across angiosperms and offer new directions for investigations of related proteins.
28081268	The Rice Dynamin-Related Protein OsDRP1E Negatively Regulates Programmed Cell Death by Controlling the Release of Cytochrome c from Mitochondria.	2017	PLoS Pathog	Programmed cell death (PCD) mediated by mitochondrial processes has emerged as an important mechanism for plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the role of translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol during PCD remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the rice dynamin-related protein 1E (OsDRP1E) negatively regulates PCD by controlling mitochondrial structure and cytochrome c release. We used a map-based cloning strategy to isolate OsDRP1E from the lesion mimic mutant dj-lm and confirmed that the E409V mutation in OsDRP1E causes spontaneous cell death in rice. Pathogen inoculation showed that dj-lm significantly enhances resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. Functional analysis of the E409V mutation showed that the mutant protein impairs OsDRP1E self-association and formation of a higher-order complex; this in turn reduces the GTPase activity of OsDRP1E. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that the E409V mutation impairs localization of OsDRP1E to the mitochondria. The E409V mutation significantly affects the morphogenesis of cristae in mitochondria and causes the abnormal release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the mitochondria-localized protein OsDRP1E functions as a negative regulator of cytochrome c release and PCD in plants.
28119718	4-Coumarate-CoA Ligase-Like Gene <i>OsAAE3</i> Negatively Mediates the Rice Blast Resistance, Floret Development and Lignin Biosynthesis.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Although adenosine monophosphate (AMP) binding domain is widely distributed in multiple plant species, detailed molecular functions of AMP binding proteins (AMPBPs) in plant development and plant-pathogen interaction remain unclear. In the present study, we identified an AMPBP OsAAE3 from a previous analysis of early responsive genes in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection. OsAAE3 is a homolog of Arabidopsis AAE3 in rice, which encodes a 4-coumarate-Co-A ligase (4CL) like protein. A phylogenetic analysis showed that OsAAE3 was most likely 4CL-like 10 in an independent group. OsAAE3 was localized to cytoplasm, and it could be expressed in various tissues. Histochemical staining of transgenic plants carrying OsAAE3 promoter-driven GUS (β-glucuronidase) reporter gene suggested that OsAAE3 was expressed in all tissues of rice. Furthermore, OsAAE3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility to M. Oryzae, and this finding was attributable to decreased expression of pathogen-related 1a (PR1) and low level of peroxidase (POD) activity. Moreover, OsAAE3 over-expression resulted in increased content of H2O2, leading to programmed cell-death induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, OsAAE3 over-expression repressed the floret development, exhibiting dramatically twisted glume and decreased fertility rate of anther. Meanwhile, the expressions of lignin biosynthesis genes were significantly decreased in OsAAE3-OX plants, thereby leading to reduced lignin content. Taken together, OsAAE3 functioned as a negative regulator in rice blast resistance, floret development, and lignin biosynthesis. Our findings further expanded the knowledge in functions of AMBPs in plant floret development and the regulation of rice-fungus interaction.
28095114	Flowering time regulation by the CONSTANS-Like gene OsCOL10.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Plant flowering at the appropriate time is critical for reproductive success and influenced by a series of environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature. A number of genes involved in photoperiodic flowering of have been cloned and their roles in modulating expression of the flowering genes have been characterized to a certain extent. However, much less is known about the pathway in transmitting the day length response signal(s) to induce transition to reproductive growth. Recently, we characterized a constitutive flowering repressor OsCOL10 encoding for a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family. Through transgenic analysis, we have showed that OsCOL10 repress flowering by reducing expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1. Moreover, we also showed that OsCOL10 acts downstream of Ghd7, a key LD-specific flowering repressor by reducing expression of Ehd1. Collectively, our finding identifies OsCOL10 functioning as a flowering-time repressor that links between Ghd7 and Ehd1 in rice.
28068433	Molecular and Functional Characterization of GR2-R1 Event Based Backcross Derived Lines of Golden Rice in the Genetic Background of a Mega Rice Variety Swarna.	2017	PLoS One	Homozygous Golden Rice lines developed in the background of Swarna through marker assisted backcross breeding (MABB) using transgenic GR2-R1 event as a donor for the provitamin A trait have high levels of provitamin A (up to 20 ppm) but are dwarf with pale green leaves and drastically reduced panicle size, grain number and yield as compared to the recurrent parent, Swarna. In this study, we carried out detailed morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization of these lines in a quest to identify the probable reasons for their abnormal phenotype. Nucleotide blast analysis with the primer sequences used to amplify the transgene revealed that the integration of transgene disrupted the native OsAux1 gene, which codes for an auxin transmembrane transporter protein. Real time expression analysis of the transgenes (ZmPsy and CrtI) driven by endosperm-specific promoter revealed the leaky expression of the transgene in the vegetative tissues. We propose that the disruption of OsAux1 disturbed the fine balance of plant growth regulators viz., auxins, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, leading to the abnormalities in the growth and development of the lines homozygous for the transgene. The study demonstrates the conserved roles of OsAux1 gene in rice and Arabidopsis.
28232844	Regulating Tradeoffs to Improve Rice Production.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plants are sessile organisms that are continuously exposed to a wide range of environmental stresses. To cope with various stresses using limited resources, plants have evolved diverse mechanisms of "tradeoff" that enable the allocation of resources to address the most life-threatening stress. During our studies on induced disease resistance in rice, we have found some important phenomena relevant to tradeoffs between biotic and abiotic stress responses, and between stress response and plant growth. We characterized these tradeoff phenomena from viewpoints of signaling crosstalks associated with transcriptional regulation. Here, I describe following topics: (1) PTP1-dependent increased disease susceptibility of rice under low temperature and high salinity conditions, (2) OsNPR1-dependent tradeoff between pathogen defense and photosynthesis, (3) tradeoff between pathogen defense and abiotic stress tolerance in WRKY45-overexpressing rice plants, and (4) WRKY62-dependent tradeoff between pathogen defense and hypoxia tolerance. Lastly, I discuss my view regarding the significance of such tradeoffs in agricultural production that should be considered in crop breeding; that is, the tradeoffs, although they benefit plants in nature, can be rather disadvantageous in agricultural production.
28220140	NBS-LRR Protein Pik-H4 Interacts with OsBIHD1 to Balance Rice Blast Resistance and Growth by Coordinating Ethylene-Brassinosteroid Pathway.	2017	Front Plant Sci	The regulation of innate immunity and plant growth, along with the trade-off between them, affects the defense and recovery mechanisms of the plant after it is attacked by pathogens. Although it is known that hormonal crosstalk plays a major role in regulating interaction of plant growth and PAMP-triggered immunity, the relationship between plant growth and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) remains unclear. In a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screening for Pik-H4-interacting proteins, a homeodomain transcription factor OsBIHD1 was identified, which is previously known to function in biotic and abiotic stress responses. The knockout of OsBIHD1 in rice lines carrying Pik-H4 largely compromised the resistance of the rice lines to Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast. While overexpression of OsBIHD1 resulted in enhanced expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) and ethylene (ET) synthesis genes. Moreover, OsBIHD1 was also found to directly bind to the promoter region of ethylene-synthesis enzyme OsACO3. In addition, OsBIHD1 overexpression or deficiency provoked dwarfism and reduced brassinosteroid (BR) insensitivity through repressing the expression of several critical genes involved in BR biosynthesis and BR signaling. During M. oryzae infection, transcript levels of the crucial BR catabolic genes (CYP734A2, CYP734A4, and CYP734A6) were significantly up-regulated in OsBIHD1-OX plants. Furthermore, OsBIHD1 was found to be capable of binding to the sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of CYP734A2 to suppress the plant growth under fungal invasion. Our results collectively suggest a model that OsBIHD1 is required for Pik-H4-mediated blast resistance through modulating the trade-off between resistance and growth by coordinating brassinosteroid-ethylene pathway.
28049740	Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination.	2017	Plant Physiol	Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of OsGEN1 and OsSEND1, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (Oryza sativa). We first investigated the role of OsGEN1 during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in osgen1 mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the osgen1 mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of OsSEND1 had no effects on plant development and did not enhance osgen1 defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.
28261251	Transcript Profiling Reveals the Presence of Abiotic Stress and Developmental Stage Specific Ascorbate Oxidase Genes in Plants.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Abiotic stress and climate change is the major concern for plant growth and crop yield. Abiotic stresses lead to enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) consequently resulting in cellular damage and major losses in crop yield. One of the major scavengers of ROS is ascorbate (AA) which acts as first line of defense against external oxidants. An enzyme named ascorbate oxidase (AAO) is known to oxidize AA and deleteriously affect the plant system in response to stress. Genome-wide analysis of AAO gene family has led to the identification of five, three, seven, four, and six AAO genes in Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis, Glycine max, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor genomes, respectively. Expression profiling of these genes was carried out in response to various abiotic stresses and during various stages of vegetative and reproductive development using publicly available microarray database. Expression analysis in Oryza sativa revealed tissue specific expression of AAO genes wherein few members were exclusively expressed in either root or shoot. These genes were found to be regulated by both developmental cues as well as diverse stress conditions. The qRT-PCR analysis in response to salinity and drought stress in rice shoots revealed OsAAO2 to be the most stress responsive gene. On the other hand, OsAAO3 and OsAAO4 genes showed enhanced expression in roots under salinity/drought stresses. This study provides lead about important stress responsive AAO genes in various crop plants, which could be used to engineer climate resilient crop plants.
28068345	Transcriptional and Post-transcriptional Mechanisms Limit Heading Date 1 (Hd1) Function to Adapt Rice to High Latitudes.	2017	PLoS Genet	Rice flowering is controlled by changes in the photoperiod that promote the transition to the reproductive phase as days become shorter. Natural genetic variation for flowering time has been largely documented and has been instrumental to define the genetics of the photoperiodic pathway, as well as providing valuable material for artificial selection of varieties better adapted to local environments. We mined genetic variation in a collection of rice varieties highly adapted to European regions and isolated distinct variants of the long day repressor HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1) that perturb its expression or protein function. Specific variants allowed us to define novel features of the photoperiodic flowering pathway. We demonstrate that a histone fold domain scaffold formed by GRAIN YIELD, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 8 (Ghd8) and several NF-YC subunits can accommodate distinct proteins, including Hd1 and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), and that the resulting OsNF-Y complex containing Hd1 can bind a specific sequence in the promoter of HEADING DATE 3A (Hd3a). Artificial selection has locally favored an Hd1 variant unable to assemble in such heterotrimeric complex. The causal polymorphism was defined as a single conserved lysine in the CCT domain of the Hd1 protein. Our results indicate how genetic variation can be stratified and explored at multiple levels, and how its description can contribute to the molecular understanding of basic developmental processes.
28129387	Mutation in Mg-Protoporphyrin IX Monomethyl Ester Cyclase Decreases Photosynthesis Capacity in Rice.	2017	PLoS One	In photosynthesis, the pigments chlorophyll a/b absorb light energy to convert to chemical energy in chloroplasts. Though most enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis from glutamyl-tRNA to chlorophyll a/b have been identified, the exact composition and regulation of the multimeric enzyme Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase (MPEC) is largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a rice pale-green leaf mutant m167 with yellow-green leaf phenotype across the whole lifespan. Chlorophyll content decreases 43-51% and the granal stacks of chloroplasts becomes thinner in m167. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, including Fv/Fm (the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII) and quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)), were lower in m167 than those in wild type plants (WT), and photosynthesis rate decreases 40% in leaves of m167 mutant compared with WT plants, which lead to yield reduction in m167. Genetic analysis revealed that yellow-green leaf phenotype of m167 is controlled by a single recessive genetic locus. By positional cloning, a single mutated locus, G286A (Alanine 96 to Threonine in protein), was found in the coding sequence of LOC_Os01g17170 (Rice Copper Response Defect 1, OsCRD1), encoding a putative subunit of MPEC. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that OsCRD1 is mainly expressed in green tissues of rice. Sequence alignment analysis of CRD1 indicated that Alanine 96 is very conserved in all green plants and photosynthetic bacteria. OsCRD1 protein mainly locates in chloroplast and the point mutation A96T in OsCRD1 does not change its location. Therefore, Alanine96 of OsCRD1 might be fundamental for MPEC activity, mutation of which leads to deficiency in chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development and decreases photosynthetic capacity in rice.
28116829	Improvement in phosphate acquisition and utilization by a secretory purple acid phosphatase (OsPAP21b) in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Phosphate (Pi) deficiency in soil system is a limiting factor for rice growth and yield. Majority of the soil phosphorus (P) is organic in nature, not readily available for root uptake. Low Pi-inducible purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are hypothesized to enhance the availability of Pi in soil and cellular system. However, information on molecular and physiological roles of rice PAPs is very limited. Here, we demonstrate the role of a novel rice PAP, OsPAP21b in improving plant utilization of organic-P. OsPAP21b was found to be under the transcriptional control of OsPHR2 and strictly regulated by plant Pi status at both transcript and protein levels. Biochemically, OsPAP21b showed hydrolysis of several organophosphates at acidic pH and possessed sufficient thermostability befitting for high-temperature rice ecosystems with acidic soils. Interestingly, OsPAP21b was revealed to be a secretory PAP and encodes a distinguishable major APase (acid phosphatase) isoform under low Pi in roots. Further, OsPAP21b-overexpressing transgenics showed increased biomass, APase activity and P content in both hydroponics supplemented with organic-P sources and soil containing organic manure as sole P source. Additionally, overexpression lines depicted increased root length, biomass and lateral roots under low Pi while RNAi lines showed reduced root length and biomass as compared to WT. In the light of these evidences, present study strongly proposes OsPAP21b as a useful candidate for improving Pi acquisition and utilization in rice.
28298917	Arsenic Transport in Rice and Biological Solutions to Reduce Arsenic Risk from Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) feeds ∼3 billion people. Due to the wide occurrence of arsenic (As) pollution in paddy soils and its efficient plant uptake, As in rice grains presents health risks. Genetic manipulation may offer an effective approach to reduce As accumulation in rice grains. The genetics of As uptake and metabolism have been elucidated and target genes have been identified for genetic engineering to reduce As accumulation in grains. Key processes controlling As in grains include As uptake, arsenite (AsIII) efflux, arsenate (AsV) reduction and AsIII sequestration, and As methylation and volatilization. Recent advances, including characterization of AsV uptake transporter OsPT8, AsV reductase OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2, rice glutaredoxins, and rice ABC transporter OsABCC1, make many possibilities to develop low-arsenic rice.
27964781	Plant architecture and grain yield are regulated by the novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Sci	In many plants, architecture and grain yield are affected by both the environment and genetics. In rice, the tiller is a vital factor impacting plant architecture and regulated by many genes. In this study, we cloned a novel DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene Os02g0819100 and its alternative splice variant OsDHHC1 from the cDNA of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which regulate plant architecture by altering the tiller in rice. The tillers increased by about 40% when this type of DHHC-type zinc finger protein gene was over-expressed in Zhong Hua 11 (ZH11) rice plants. Moreover, the grain yield of transgenic rice increased approximately by 10% compared with wild-type ZH11. These findings provide an important genetic engineering approach for increasing rice yields.
28197164	Isolation, Characterization and Transcriptome Analysis of a Cytokinin Receptor Mutant <i>Osckt1</i> in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Cytokinins play important roles in regulating plant development, including shoot and root meristems, leaf longevity, and grain yield. However, the in planta functions of rice cytokinin receptors have not been genetically characterized yet. Here we isolated a rice mutant, Osckt1, with enhanced tolerance to cytokinin treatment. Further analysis showed that Osckt1 was insensitive to aromatic cytokinins but responded normally to isoprenoid and phenylurea-type cytokinins. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative cytokinin receptor gene, histidine kinase 6 (OsHK6). OsCKT1 was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant and the protein was located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, whole-genome gene expression profiling analysis showed that OsCKT1 was involved in cytokinin regulation of a number of biological processes, including secondary metabolism, sucrose and starch metabolism, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that OsCKT1 plays important roles in cytokinin perception and control of root development in rice.
28134341	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Chloroplast development is an important subject in botany. In this study, a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant exhibiting impairment in early chloroplast development (seedling leaf albino (sla)) was isolated from a filial generation via hybridization breeding. The sla mutant seedlings have an aberrant form of chloroplasts, which resulted in albinism at the first and second leaves; however, the leaf sheath was green. The mutant gradually turned green after the two-leaf stage, and the third leaf was a normal shade of green. Map-based cloning indicated that the gene OsBT1-3, which belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF), is responsible for the sla mutant phenotype. OsBT1-3 expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings. The results also showed that OsBT1-3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was targeted to the chloroplast, and a Western blot assay using a peptide-specific antibody indicated that OsBT1-3 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. We also demonstrated that OsBT1-3 functions as a unidirectional transporter of adenine nucleotides. Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage.
28423046	Genetic structure and isolation by altitude in rice landraces of Yunnan, China revealed by nucleotide and microsatellite marker polymorphisms.	2017	PLoS One	Rice landraces, a genetic reservoir for varietal improvement, are developed by farmers through artificial selection during the long-term domestication process. To efficiently conserve, manage, and use such germplasm resources, an understanding of the genetic structure and differentiation of local rice landraces is required. In this study, we analyzed 188 accessions of rice landraces collected from localities across an altitudinal gradient from 425 to 2, 274 m above sea level in Yunnan Province, China using ten target genes and 48 SSR markers. We detected clear differentiation of the rice landraces into indica and japonica groups and further separation of the accessions in each group into two subgroups according to altitude, including a lower altitude subgroup and higher altitude subgroup. The AMOVA results showed significant genetic differentiation among altitude zones at SSRs and most genes, except Os1977 and STS22. We further determined that differentiation among landrace populations followed a model of isolation by altitude, in which gene flow was higher among populations at similar altitude levels than across different altitude levels. Our findings demonstrated that both adaptation to altitude and altitude-dependent gene flow played key roles in the genetic differentiation of rice landraces in Yunnan, China.
28197156	Fine Mapping of <i>Carbon Assimilation Rate 8</i>, a Quantitative Trait Locus for Flag Leaf Nitrogen Content, Stomatal Conductance and Photosynthesis in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Increasing the rate of leaf photosynthesis is one important approach for increasing grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa). Exploiting the natural variation in CO2 assimilation rate (A) between rice cultivars using quantitative genetics is one promising means to identify genes contributing to higher photosynthesis. In this study, we determined precise location of Carbon Assimilation Rate 8 (CAR8) by crossing a high-yielding indica cultivar with a Japanese commercial cultivar. Fine mapping suggested that CAR8 encodes a putative Heme Activator Protein 3 (OsHAP3) subunit of a CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor called OsHAP3H. Sequencing analysis revealed that the indica allele of CAR8 has a 1-bp deletion at 322 bp from the start codon, resulting in a truncated protein of 125 amino acids. In addition, CAR8 is identical to DTH8/Ghd8/LHD1, which was reported to control rice flowering date. The increase of A is largely due to an increase of RuBP regeneration rate via increased leaf nitrogen content, and partially explained by reduced stomatal limitation via increased stomatal conductance relative to A. This allele also increases hydraulic conductivity, which would promote higher stomatal conductance. This indicates that CAR8 affects multiple physiological aspects relating to photosynthesis. The detailed analysis of molecular functions of CAR8 would help to understand the association between photosynthesis and flowering and demonstrate specific genetic mechanisms that can be exploited to improve photosynthesis in rice and potentially other crops.
28491065	OsPhyB-Mediating Novel Regulatory Pathway for Drought Tolerance in Rice Root Identified by a Global RNA-Seq Transcriptome Analysis of Rice Genes in Response to Water Deficiencies.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Water deficiencies are one of the most serious challenges to crop productivity. To improve our understanding of soil moisture stress, we performed RNA-Seq analysis using roots from 4-week-old rice seedlings grown in soil that had been subjected to drought conditions for 2-3 d. In all, 1,098 genes were up-regulated in response to soil moisture stress for 3 d, which causes severe damage in root development after recovery, unlikely that of 2 d. Comparison with previous transcriptome data produced in drought condition indicated that more than 68% of our candidate genes were not previously identified, emphasizing the novelty of our transcriptome analysis for drought response in soil condition. We then validated the expression patterns of two candidate genes using a promoter-GUS reporter system in planta and monitored the stress response with novel molecular markers. An integrating omics tool, MapMan analysis, indicated that RING box E3 ligases in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways are significantly stimulated by induced drought. We also analyzed the functions of 66 candidate genes that have been functionally investigated previously, suggesting the primary roles of our candidate genes in resistance or tolerance relating traits including drought tolerance (29 genes) through literature searches besides diverse regulatory roles of our candidate genes for morphological traits (15 genes) or physiological traits (22 genes). Of these, we used a T-DNA insertional mutant of rice phytochrome B (OsPhyB) that negatively regulates a plant's degree of tolerance to water deficiencies through the control of total leaf area and stomatal density based on previous finding. Unlike previous result, we found that OsPhyB represses the activity of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase mediating reactive oxygen species (ROS) processing machinery required for drought tolerance of roots in soil condition, suggesting the potential significance of remaining uncharacterized candidate genes for manipulating drought tolerance in rice.
28062835	The OsMYB30 Transcription Factor Suppresses Cold Tolerance by Interacting with a JAZ Protein and Suppressing β-Amylase Expression.	2017	Plant Physiol	Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice (Oryza sativa) productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in the cold stress response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB30, for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMYB30 in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the osmyb30 knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that a few β-amylase (BMY) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The BMY activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the OsMYB30 overexpression and osmyb30 knockout mutant, respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the BMY genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the BMY genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the BMY genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein, OsJAZ9, that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine-tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose, which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.
28067270	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	2017	Sci Rep	Biosynthesis of sakuranetin, a flavonoid anti-fungal phytoalexin that occurs in rice, is highly dependent on jasmonic acid (JA) signalling and induced by a variety of environmental stimuli. We previously identified OsNOMT, which encodes naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT); NOMT is a key enzyme for sakuranetin production. Although OsNOMT expression is induced by JA treatment, the regulation mechanism that activates the biosynthetic pathway of sakuranetin has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that JA-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor OsMYC2 drastically enhances the activity of the OsNOMT promoter and is essential for JA-inducible sakuranetin production. In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2. Physical interaction of OsMYC2 with OsMYL1 and OsMYL2 further supported the idea that these interactions lead to the enhancement of the transactivation activity of OsMYC2. Our results indicate that JA signalling via OsMYC2 is reinforced by OsMYL1 and OsMYL2, resulting in the inductive production of sakuranetin during defence responses in rice.
28064119	Identification and expression analysis of the NAC transcription factor family in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum).	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	The NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) proteins belong to one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor (TF) families and play important roles in plant development processes, response to biotic and abiotic cues and hormone signaling. Our analysis led to the identification of 168 NAC genes in durum wheat, including nine putative membrane-bound TFs and 48 homeologous genes pairs. Phylogenetic analyses of TtNACs along with their Arabidopsis, grape, barley and rice counterparts divided these proteins into 8 phylogenetic groups and allowed the identification of TtNAC-A7, TtNAC-B35, TtNAC-A68, TtNAC-B69 and TtNAC-A43 as homologs of OsNAC1, OsNAC8, OsNTL2, OsNTL5 and ANAC025/NTL14, respectively. In silico expression analysis, using RNA-seq data, revealed tissue-specific and stress responsive TtNAC genes. The expression of ten selected genes was analyzed under salt and drought stresses in two contrasting tolerance cultivars. This analysis is the first report of NAC gene family in durum wheat and will be useful for the identification and selection of candidate genes associated with stress tolerance.
28124144	Interaction between southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus minor core protein P8 and a rice zinc finger transcription factor.	2017	Arch Virol	The fijivirus southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) causes one of the most serious viral diseases of rice in China and Vietnam. To better understand the molecular basis of SRBSDV infection, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rice cDNA library was carried out using P8, a minor core protein of SRBSDV, as the bait. A rice Cys2His2-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP) was found to interact with SRBSDV P8. A strong interaction between SRBSDV P8 and OsZFP was then confirmed by pull-down assays, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that the in vivo interaction was specifically localized in the nucleus of plant cells. Using a series of deletion mutants, it was shown that both the NTP-binding region of P8 and the first two zinc fingers of OsZFP were crucial for their interaction in plant cells. The localization in the nucleus and activation of transcription in yeast supports the notion that OsZFP is a transcription factor. SRBSDV P8 may play an important role in fijiviral infection and symptom development by interfering with the host transcription activity of OsZFP.
28293247	Increase of Fungal Pathogenicity and Role of Plant Glutamine in Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility (NIS) To Rice Blast.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Highlight  Modifications in glutamine synthetase OsGS1-2 expression and fungal pathogenicity underlie nitrogen-induced susceptibility to rice blast. Understanding why nitrogen fertilization increase the impact of many plant diseases is of major importance. The interaction between Magnaporthe oryzae and rice was used as a model for analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility (NIS). We show that our experimental system in which nitrogen supply strongly affects rice blast susceptibility only slightly affects plant growth. In order to get insights into the mechanisms of NIS, we conducted a dual RNA-seq experiment on rice infected tissues under two nitrogen fertilization regimes. On the one hand, we show that enhanced susceptibility was visible despite an over-induction of defense gene expression by infection under high nitrogen regime. On the other hand, the fungus expressed to high levels effectors and pathogenicity-related genes in plants under high nitrogen regime. We propose that in plants supplied with elevated nitrogen fertilization, the observed enhanced induction of plant defense is over-passed by an increase in the expression of the fungal pathogenicity program, thus leading to enhanced susceptibility. Moreover, some rice genes implicated in nitrogen recycling were highly induced during NIS. We further demonstrate that the OsGS1-2 glutamine synthetase gene enhances plant resistance to M. oryzae and abolishes NIS and pinpoint glutamine as a potential key nutrient during NIS.
28043949	The OsHAPL1-DTH8-Hd1 complex functions as the transcription regulator to repress heading date in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Heading date is an important agronomic trait related to crop yield. Many genes related to heading date have already been identified in rice (Oryza sativa), and a complicated, preliminary regulatory genetic network has also already been established, but the protein regulatory network is poorly understood. We have identified a novel heading date regulator, Heme Activator Protein like 1 (OsHAPL1), which inhibits flowering under long-day conditions. OsHAPL1 is a nuclear-localized protein that is highly expressed in leaves in a rhythmic manner. OsHAPL1 can physically interact with Days To Heading on chromosome 8 (DTH8), which physically interacts with Heading date 1 (Hd1) both in vitro and in vivo. OsHAPL1 forms a complex with DTH8 and Hd1 in Escherichia coli. OsHAPL1, DTH8, and Hd1 physically interact with the HAP complex, and also with general transcription factors in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Further studies showed that OsHAPL1 represses the expression of the florigen genes and FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) and Hd3a through Early heading date 1 (Ehd1). We propose that OsHAPL1 functions as a transcriptional regulator and, together with DTH8, Hd1, the HAP complex, and general transcription factors, regulates the expression of target genes and then affects heading date by influencing the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1.
28124210	A temporal and spatial contribution of asparaginase to asparagine catabolism during development of rice grains.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Asparagine is one of the most dominant organic nitrogen compounds in phloem and xylem sap in a wide range of plant species. Asparaginase (ASNase; EC, 3.5.1.1) catabolizes asparagine into aspartate and ammonium; therefore, it is suggested to play a key role in asparagine metabolism within legume sink organs. However, the metabolic fate of asparagine in source and sink organs during rice seed production remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the asparagine metabolism in a temporal and spatial manner during rice seed production.

RESULTS: For this purpose, the expression of genes involved in asparagine catabolism, such as asparaginase1 (OsASNase1) and 2 (OsASNase2), were quantitatively measured, and contents of asparagine, aspartate and ammonium ions were determined in sink and source organs during spikelet ripening. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ localization studies determined that OsASNase2 is expressed in the dorsal vascular bundles and nucellar projection of developing grains, as well as in mesophyll and phloem companion cells of senescent flag leaves. Amino acid measurements revealed that the aspartate concentration is higher than asparagine in both source and sink organs.

CONCLUSION: This work suggests that asparaginase dependent asparagine catabolism occurred not only in sink but also in source organs.
28394944	Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein OsMTP11 as a manganese transporter.	2017	PLoS One	Metal tolerance proteins (MTPs) are a gene family of cation efflux transporters that occur widely in plants and might serve an essential role in metal homeostasis and tolerance. Our research describes the identification, characterization, and localization of OsMTP11, a member of the MTP family from rice. OsMTP11 was expressed constitutively and universally in different tissues in rice plant. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that OsMTP11 complemented the hypersensitivity of mutant strains to Mn, and also complemented yeast mutants to other metals, including Co and Ni. Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated OsMTP11 expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of OsMTP11 involvement in heavy metal stress responses. Promoter analysis by transgenic assays with GUS as a reporter gene and mRNA in situ hybridization experiments showed that OsMTP11 was expressed specifically in conducting tissues in rice. DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the OsMTP11 promoter region, which was consistent with OsMTP11 induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress. This result suggested that DNA methylation is one of major factors regulating expression of OsMTP11 through epigenetic mechanisms. OsMTP11 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized to the entire onion epidermal cell cytoplasm, while vacuolar membrane exhibited increased GFP signals, consistent with an OsMTP11 function in cation sequestration. Our results indicated that OsMTP11 might play vital roles in Mn and other heavy metal transportation in rice.
28102545	Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK17 targets plasma membrane intrinsic protein and sucrose-phosphate synthase and is required for a proper cold stress response.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in plant tolerance mechanisms to abiotic stresses. Although CDPKs are recognized as key messengers in signal transduction, the specific role of most members of this family remains unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that OsCPK17 plays a role in rice cold stress response by analysing OsCPK17 knockout, silencing and overexpressing rice lines under low temperature. Altered OsCPK17 gene expression compromises cold tolerance performance, without affecting the expression of key cold stress-inducible genes. A comparative phosphoproteomic approach led to the identification of six potential in vivo OsCPK17 targets, which are associated with sugar and nitrogen metabolism, and with osmotic regulation. To test direct interaction, in vitro kinase assays were performed, showing that the sucrose-phosphate synthase OsSPS4 and the aquaporin OsPIP2;1/OsPIP2;6 are phosphorylated by OsCPK17 in a calcium-dependent manner. Altogether, our data indicates that OsCPK17 is required for a proper cold stress response in rice, likely affecting the activity of membrane channels and sugar metabolism.
28059073	ROS accumulation and antiviral defence control by microRNA528 in rice.	2017	Nat Plants	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Modulating miRNA function has emerged as a new strategy to produce virus resistance traits1-5. However, the miRNAs involved in antiviral defence and the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. We previously demonstrated that sequestration by Argonaute (AGO) proteins plays an important role in regulating miRNA function in antiviral defence pathways6. Here we reveal that cleavage-defective AGO18 complexes sequester microRNA528 (miR528) upon viral infection. We show that miR528 negatively regulates viral resistance in rice by cleaving L-ascorbate oxidase (AO) messenger RNA, thereby reducing AO-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Upon viral infection, miR528 becomes preferentially associated with AGO18, leading to elevated AO activity, higher basal reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced antiviral defence. Our findings reveal a mechanism in which antiviral defence is boosted through suppression of an miRNA that negatively regulates viral resistance. This mechanism could be manipulated to engineer virus-resistant crop plants.
28119700	Non-photochemical Quenching Plays a Key Role in Light Acclimation of Rice Plants Differing in Leaf Color.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is an important photoprotective mechanism in rice; however, little is known regarding its role in the photosynthetic response of rice plants with differing in leaf color to different irradiances. In this study, two rice genotypes containing different chlorophyll contents, namely Zhefu802 (high chlorophyll) and Chl-8 (low chlorophyll), were subjected to moderate or high levels of light intensity at the 6-leaf stage. Chl-8 possessed a lower chlorophyll content and higher chlorophyll a:b ratio compared with Zhefu802, while Pn, Fv/Fm, and ΦPSII contents were higher in Chl-8. Further results indicated that no significant differences were observed in the activities of Rubisco, Mg2+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase between these genotypes. This suggested that no significant difference in the capacity for CO2 assimilation exists between Zhe802 and Chl-8. Additionally, no significant differences in stomatal limitation were observed between the genotypes. Interestingly, higher NPQ and energy quenching (qE), as well as lower photoinhibitory quenching (qI) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in Chl-8 compared with Zhefu802 under both moderate and high light treatments. This indicated that NPQ could improve photosynthesis in rice under both moderate and high light intensities, particularly the latter, whereby NPQ alleviates photodamage by reducing ROS production. Both zeaxanthin content and the expression of PsbS1 were associated with the induction of NPQ under moderate light, while only zeaxanthin was associated with NPQ induction under high light. In summary, NPQ could improve photosynthesis in rice under moderate light and alleviate photodamage under high light via a decrease in ROS generation.
28326091	Generation of High-Amylose Rice through CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Targeted Mutagenesis of Starch Branching Enzymes.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Cereals high in amylose content (AC) and resistant starch (RS) offer potential health benefits. Previous studies using chemical mutagenesis or RNA interference have demonstrated that starch branching enzyme (SBE) plays a major role in determining the fine structure and physical properties of starch. However, it remains a challenge to control starch branching in commercial lines. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate targeted mutagenesis in SBEI and SBEIIb in rice. The frequencies of obtained homozygous or bi-allelic mutant lines with indels in SBEI and SBEIIb in T0 generation were from 26.7 to 40%. Mutations in the homozygous T0 lines stably transmitted to the T1 generation and those in the bi-allelic lines segregated in a Mendelian fashion. Transgene-free plants carrying only the frame-shifted mutagenesis were recovered in T1 generation following segregation. Whereas no obvious differences were observed between the sbeI mutants and wild type, sbeII mutants showed higher proportion of long chains presented in debranched amylopectin, significantly increased AC and RS content to as higher as 25.0 and 9.8%, respectively, and thus altered fine structure and nutritional properties of starch. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time the feasibility to create high-amylose rice through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of SBEIIb.
28303149	QTL Hotspots for Early Vigor and Related Traits under Dry Direct-Seeded System in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Strong seedling vigor is desirable trait in dry direct-seeded rice (DSR) for enhancing crop establishment and the ability to compete against weeds. A set of 253 BC3F4 lines derived from cross between Swarna and Moroberekan was phenotyped for early vigor (EV) and 8 related traits viz., early uniform emergence (EUE), shoot length (SHL), stem length (SL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), total fresh weight (TFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), total dry weight (TDW), and root dry weight (RDW). Composite interval mapping analysis using genotypic data from 194 SNP markers identified six genomic regions associated with traits on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, and 6 with phenotypic variance ranging from 2.5 to 18.6%. Among them 2 QTL regions; one on chr3 (id3001701-id300833) and the other on chr5 (wd5002636-id5001470) were identified as QTL hotspots A and B respectively and expressed consistently in field as well as glasshouse condition. The majority of QTLs identified for early vigor, and related traits were clustered in the QTL hotspots A (qEV3.1, qEUE3.1, qSHL3.1, qSL3.1, qSFW3.1, qTFW3.1, qRDW3.1 ) and QTL hotspot B (qEV5.1, qEUE5.1, qSHL5.1, qSL5.1, qSFW5.1, qSDW5.1, qTDW5.1 ). Ten putative candidate genes viz., 1-alpha-amylase precursor, 2-glutamate decarboxylase, 1-ethylene-insensitive 3, 3-expansin precursor, and 3-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase associated with the target traits were identified in the selected QTL regions. Mutations were identified in the coding region of alpha-amylase precursor and ethylene-insensitive 3 gene between the parents which can be utilized in marker assisted breeding. Trait relationships among the agro-physiological traits were examined to select the best genotypes for the given traits for use in future breeding programs.
28064177	Nitric oxide acts upstream of ethylene in cell wall phosphorus reutilization in phosphorus-deficient rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene are both involved in cell wall phosphorus (P) reutilization in P-deficient rice; however, the crosstalk between them remains unclear. In the present study using P-deficient 'Nipponbare' (Nip), root NO accumulation significantly increased after 1 h and reached a maximum at 3 h, while ethylene production significantly increased after 3 h and reached a maximum at 6 h, indicating NO responded more quickly than ethylene. Irrespective of P status, addition of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) significantly increased while the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO) significantly decreased the production of ethylene, while neither the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) nor the ethylene inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) had any influence on NO accumulation, suggesting NO acted upstream of ethylene. Under P-deficient conditions, SNP and ACC alone significantly increased root soluble P content through increasing pectin content, and c-PTIO addition to the ACC treatment still showed the same tendency; however, AVG+SNP treatment had no effect, further indicating that ethylene was the downstream signal affecting pectin content. The expression of the phosphate transporter gene OsPT2 showed the same tendency as the NO-ethylene-pectin pathway. Taken together, we conclude that ethylene functions downstream of NO in cell wall P reutilization in P-deficient rice.
28217135	TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> (Linnaeus).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plant terpene synthases (TPSs) are key enzymes responsible for terpene biosynthesis, and can play important roles in defense against herbivore attack. In rice, the protein sequence of TPS46 was most closely related to maize TPS10. However, unlike maize tps10, tps46 was also constitutively expressed in rice even in the absence of herbivore attack. Potential roles or constitutive emissions of specific volatiles may due to the constitutive expressions of tps46 in rice. Therefore, in the present study, RNA interference (Ri) and overexpression (Oe) rice lines were generated to investigate the potential function of TPS46 in Oryza sativa sp. japonica. Interestingly, the rice plants become more susceptible to Rhopalosiphum padi when expression of tps46 was silenced compared with Wt in greenhouse conditions. Artificial infestation bioassays further confirmed that Ri rice lines were susceptible to R. padi, whereas Oe rice lines were repellent to R. padi. Based on GC-MS and ToF-MS analysis, a total of eight volatile products catalyzed by TPS46 in rice were identified. Among them, only limonene and Eβf could be detected in all the Ri, Oe, and Wt lines, whereas other six volatiles were only found in the blend of volatiles from Oe lines. Moreover, the amount of constitutive limonene and Eβf in the Ri lines was significantly lower than in Wt lines, while the amounts of these two volatiles in the Oe line were obviously higher than in control rice. Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of Eβf and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of tps46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against R. padi. Consequently, tps46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids.
28101096	New Candidate Genes Affecting Rice Grain Appearance and Milling Quality Detected by Genome-Wide and Gene-Based Association Analyses.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Appearance and milling quality are two crucial properties of rice grains affecting its market acceptability. Understanding the genetic base of rice grain quality could considerably improve the high quality breeding. Here, we carried out an association analysis to identify QTL affecting nine rice grain appearance and milling quality traits using a diverse panel of 258 accessions selected from 3K Rice Genome Project and evaluated in two environments Sanya and Shenzhen. Genome-wide association analyses using 22,488 high quality SNPs identified 72 QTL affecting the nine traits. Combined gene-based association and haplotype analyses plus functional annotation allowed us to shortlist 19 candidate genes for seven important QTL regions affecting the grain quality traits, including two cloned genes (GS3 and TUD), two fine mapped QTL (qGRL7.1 and qPGWC7) and three newly identified QTL (qGL3.4, qGW1.1, and qGW10.2). The most likely candidate gene(s) for each important QTL were also discussed. This research demonstrated the superior power to shortlist candidate genes affecting complex phenotypes by the strategy of combined GWAS, gene-based association and haplotype analyses. The identified candidate genes provided valuable sources for future functional characterization and genetic improvement of rice appearance and milling quality.
28328971	Mapping the N-linked glycosites of rice (Oryza sativa L.) germinating embryos.	2017	PLoS One	Germination is a key event in the angiosperm life cycle. N-glycosylation of proteins is one of the most common post-translational modifications, and has been recognized to be an important regulator of the proteome of the germinating embryo. Here, we report the first N-linked glycosites mapping of rice embryos during germination by using a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) glycopeptides enrichment strategy associated with high accuracy mass spectrometry identification. A total of 242 glycosites from 191 unique proteins was discovered. Inspection of the motifs and sequence structures involved suggested that all the glycosites were concentrated within [NxS/T] motif, while 82.3% of them were in a coil structure. N-glycosylation preferentially occurred on proteins with glycoside hydrolase activities, which were significantly enriched in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway, suggesting that N-glycosylation is involved in embryo germination by regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Notably, protein-protein interaction analysis revealed a network with several Brassinosteroids signaling proteins, including XIAO and other BR-responsive proteins, implying that glycosylation-mediated Brassinosteroids signaling may be a key mechanism regulating rice embryo germination. In summary, this study expanded our knowledge of protein glycosylation in rice, and provided novel insight into the PTM regulation in rice seed germination.
28040882	UNBRANCHED3 regulates branching by modulating cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling in maize and rice.	2017	New Phytol	UNBRANCHED3 (UB3), a member of the SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL) gene family, regulates kernel row number by negatively modulating the size of the inflorescence meristem in maize. However, the regulatory pathway by which UB3 mediates branching remains unknown. We introduced the UB3 into rice and maize to reveal its effects in the two crop plants, respectively. Furthermore, we performed transcriptome sequencing and protein-DNA binding assay to elucidate the regulatory pathway of UB3. We found that UB3 could bind and regulate the promoters of LONELY GUY1 (LOG1) and Type-A response regulators (ARRs), which participate in cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling. Overexpression of exogenous UB3 in rice (Oryza sativa) dramatically suppressed tillering and panicle branching as a result of a greater decrease in the amount of active cytokinin. By contrast, moderate expression of UB3 suppressed tillering slightly, but promoted panicle branching by cooperating with SPL genes, resulting in a higher grain number per panicle in rice. In maize (Zea mays) ub3 mutant with an increased kernel row number, UB3 showed a low expression but cytokinin biosynthesis-related genes were up-regulated and degradation-related genes were down-regulated. These results suggest that UB3 regulates vegetative and reproductive branching by modulating cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling in maize and rice.
28119424	Photoprotection of PSI by Far-Red Light Against the Fluctuating Light-Induced Photoinhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana and Field-Grown Plants.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	It has been reported that PSI photoinhibition is induced even in wild-type plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and other species by exposure of leaves to fluctuating light (FL) for a few hours. Because plants are exposed to FL in nature, they must possess protective mechanisms against the FL-induced photodamage. Here, using A. thaliana grown at various irradiances, we examined PSI photoprotection by far-red (FR) light at intensities comparable with those observed in nature. Dark-treated leaves were illuminated by red FL alternating high/low light at 1,200/30 µmol m-2 s-1 for 800 ms/10 s. By this FL treatment without FR light for 120 min, the level of photo-oxidizable P700 was decreased by 30% even in the plants grown at high irradiances. The addition of continuous FR light during the FL suppressed this damage almost completely. With FR light, P700 was kept in a more oxidized state in both low- and high-light phases. The protective effect of FR light was diminished more in mutants of the NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-mediated cyclic electron flow around PSI (CEF-PSI) than in the PGR5 (proton gradient regulation 5)-mediated CEF-PSI, indicating that the NDH-mediated CEF-PSI would be a major contributor to PSI photoprotection in the presence of FR light. We also confirmed that PSI photoinhibition decreased with the increase in growth irradiance in A. thaliana and field-grown plants, and that this PSI photodamage was largely suppressed by addition of FR light. These results clearly indicate that the most effective PSI protection is realized in the presence of FR light.
28348570	DNA Methylation Affects the Efficiency of Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases-Mediated Genome Editing in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Genome editing in plants becomes popular since the advent of sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) that are simple to set up and efficient in various plant species. Although transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are one of the most prevalent SSNs and have a potential to provide higher target specificity by their dimeric property, TALENs are sensitive to methylated cytosines that are present not only in transposons but also in active genes in plants. In mammalian cells, the methylation sensitivity of TALENs could be overcome by using a base-recognition module (N∗) that has a higher affinity to methylated cytosine. In contrast to mammals, plants carry DNA methylation at all cytosine contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH, where H represents A, C, or T) with various degrees and effectiveness of N∗ module in genome editing in plants has not been explored. In this study, we designed sets of TALENs with or without N∗ modules and examined their efficiency in genome editing of methylated regions in rice. Although improvement in genome editing efficiency was observed with N∗-TALENs designed to a stably methylated target, another target carrying cytosines with various levels of methylation showed resistance to both normal and N∗-TALENs. The results suggest that variability of cytosine methylation in target regions is an additional factor affecting the genome editing efficiency of TALENs.
28448589	Morpho-physiological analysis of tolerance to aluminum toxicity in rice varieties of North East India.	2017	PLoS One	Aluminum (Al) is the third most abundant metal in earth crust, whose chemical form is mainly dependent on soil pH. The most toxic form of Al with respect to plants is Al3+, which exists in soil pH <5. Acidic soil significantly limits crop production mainly due to Al3+ toxicity worldwide, impacting approximately 50% of the world's arable land (in North-Eastern India 80% soil are acidic). Al3+ toxicity in plants ensues root growth inhibition leading to less nutrient and water uptake impacting crop productivity as a whole. Rice is one of the chief grains which constitutes the staple food of two-third of the world population including India and is not untouched by Al3+ toxicity. Al contamination is a critical constraint to plant production in agricultural soils of North East India. 24 indigenous Indica rice varieties (including Badshahbhog as tolerant check and Mashuri as sensitive check) were screened for Al stress tolerance in hydroponic plant growth system. Results show marked difference in growth parameters (relative growth rate, Root tolerance index, fresh and dry weight of root) of rice seedlings due to Al (100 μM) toxicity. Al3+ uptake and lipid peroxidation level also increased concomitantly under Al treatment. Histochemical assay were also performed to elucidate uptake of aluminum, loss of membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation, which were found to be more in sensitive genotypes at higher Al concentration. This study revealed that aluminum toxicity is a serious harmful problem for rice crop productivity in acid soil. Based on various parameters studied it's concluded that Disang is a comparatively tolerant variety whereas Joymati a sensitive variety. Western blot hybridization further strengthened the claim, as it demonstrated more accumulation of Glutathione reductase (GR) protein in Disang rice variety than Joymati under stressed condition. This study also observed that the emergence of lethal toxic symptoms occurs only after 48h irrespective of the dose used in the study.
28428794	Fine Mapping of a Novel <i>defective glume 1</i> (<i>dg1</i>) Mutant, Which Affects Vegetative and Spikelet Development in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	In cereal crops, vegetative and spikelet development play important roles in grain yield and quality, but the genetic mechanisms that control vegetative and spikelet development remain poorly understood in rice. Here, we identified a new rice mutant, defective glume 1 (dg1) mutant from cultivar Zhonghua11 after ethyl methanesulfonate treatment. The dg1 mutant displayed the dwarfism with small, rolled leaves, which resulted from smaller cells and more bulliform cells. The dg1 mutant also had an enlarged leaf angle and defects in brassinosteroid signaling. In the dg1 mutant, both the rudimentary glume and sterile lemma (glumes) were transformed into lemma-like organ and acquired the lemma identity. Additionally, the dg1 mutant produced slender grains. Further analysis revealed that DG1 affects grain size by regulating cell proliferation and expansion. We fine mapped the dg1 locus to a 31-kb region that includes eight open reading frames. We examined the DNA sequence and expression of these loci, but we were not able to identify the DG1 gene. Therefore, more work will be needed for cloning and functional analysis of DG1, which would contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind whole-plant development in rice.
28107426	Identification of microRNAs in Response to Drought in Common Wild Rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) Shoots and Roots.	2017	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Drought is the most important factor that limits rice production in drought-prone environments. Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) contains abundant drought-resistant genes, which provide an opportunity to explore these excellent resources as contributors to improve rice resistance, productivity, and quality.

RESULTS: In this study, we constructed four small RNA libraries, called CL and CR from PEG6000-free samples and DL and DR from PEG6000-treated samples, where 'R' indicates the root tissue and 'L' indicates the shoot tissue. A total of 200 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed under the drought-treated conditions (16% PEG6000 for 24 h), and the changes in the miRNA expression profile of the shoot were distinct from those of the root. At the miRNA level, 77 known miRNAs, which belong to 23 families, including 40 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated in the shoot, and 85 known miRNAs in 46 families, including 65 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated in the root, were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, we predicted 26 new miRNA candidates from the shoot and 43 from the root that were differentially expressed during the drought stress. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis results were consistent with high-throughput sequencing data. Moreover, 88 miRNAs that were differentially-expressed were predicted to match with 197 targets for drought-stress.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the miRNAs of O. rufipogon are responsive to drought stress. The differentially expressed miRNAs that are tissue-specific under drought conditions could play different roles in the regulation of the auxin pathway, the flowering pathway, the drought pathway, and lateral root formation. Thus, the present study provides an account of tissue-specific miRNAs that are involved in the drought adaption of O. rufipogon.
28070759	QTLs for heading date and plant height under multiple environments in rice.	2017	Genetica	Both heading date and plant height are important traits related to grain yield in rice. In this study, a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both traits under 3 long-day (LD) environments and 1 short-day (SD) environment. A total of eight QTLs for heading date and three QTLs for plant height were detected by composite interval mapping under LD conditions. Additional one QTL for heading date and three QTLs for plant height were identified by Two-QTL model under LD conditions. Among them, major QTLs qHd7.1, qHd7.2 and qHd8 for heading date, and qPh1 and qPh7.1 for plant height were commonly detected. qHd7.1 and qHd7.2 were mapped to small regions of less than 1 cM. Genome position comparison of previously cloned genes with QTLs detected in this study revealed that qHd5 and qPh3.1 were two novel QTLs. The alleles of these QTLs increasing trait values were dispersed in both parents, which well explained the transgressive segregation observed in this population. In addition, the interaction between qHd7.1 and qHd8 was detected under all LD conditions. Multiple-QTL model analysis revealed that all QTLs and their interactions explained over 80% of heading date variation and 50% of plant height variation. Two heading date QTLs were detected under SD condition. Of them, qHd10 were commonly identified under LD condition. The difference in QTL detection between LD and SD conditions indicated most heading date QTLs are sensitive to photoperiod. These findings will benefit breeding design for heading date and plant height in rice.
28487705	Genome-Wide Association Mapping Reveals Multiple QTLs Governing Tolerance Response for Seedling Stage Chilling Stress in <i>Indica</i> Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice crop is sensitive to cold stress at seedling stage. A panel of population representing 304 shortlisted germplasm lines was studied for seedling stage chilling tolerance in indica rice. Six phenotypic classes were exposed to six low temperature stress regimes under control phenotyping facility to investigate response pattern. A panel of 66 genotypes representing all phenotypic classes was used for ensuring genetic diversity, population structure and association mapping for the trait using 58 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 2 direct trait linked markers. A moderate level of genetic diversity was detected in the panel population for the trait. Deviation of Hardy-Weinberg's expectation was detected in the studied population using Wright's F statistic. The panel showed 30% variation among population and 70% among individuals. The entire population was categorized into three sub-populations through STRUCTURE analysis. This revealed tolerance for the trait had a common primary ancestor for each sub-population with few admix individuals. The panel population showed the presence of many QTLs for cold stress tolerance in the individuals representing like genome-wide expression of the trait. Nineteen SSR markers were significantly associated at chilling stress of 8°C to 4°C for 7-21 days duration. Thus, the primers linked to the seedling stage cold tolerance QTLs namely qCTS9, qCTS-2, qCTS6.1, qSCT2, qSCT11, qSCT1a, qCTS-3.1, qCTS11.1, qCTS12.1, qCTS-1b, and CTB2 need to be pyramided for development of strongly chilling tolerant variety.
28174588	<i>EARE-1</i>, a Transcriptionally Active Ty1/Copia-Like Retrotransposon Has Colonized the Genome of <i>Excoecaria agallocha</i> through Horizontal Transfer.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute the majority of the content of angiosperm genomes, but their evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a putative full-length (~9550 bp) Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon in Excoecaria agallocha and its evolution in Euphorbiaceae. The so-called EARE-1 is phylogenetically closely related to RIRE-1 from Oryza australiensis, and has proliferated recently (~7.19 Mya) in the E. agallocha genome. An RT-PCR analysis revealed substantial transcription of EARE-1 in all examined organs (leaves, staminate flowers, pistillate flowers, seeds, and roots) in unstressed E. agallocha plants and indications of elevated expression under stress. We conducted sequence analyses of 256 RT-RH fragments (~860 bp) of EARE-1 from 34 species representing four subfamilies of Euphorbiaceae that exist in China. EARE-1 copies from two Excoecaria species and Phyllanthus urinaria showed incongruent phylogeny with the host species and exhibited high sequence similarity to the host genes, suggesting a horizontal transfer from P. urinaria to the common ancestor of Excoecaria. However, SSAP analysis detected no new insertions of EARE-1 among full-sibling progeny plants of E. agallocha, despite considerable SSAP polymorphisms among half-siblings. EARE-1 is the first transcriptionally active Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon isolated from E. agallocha. Our results provide empirical evidence of the horizontal transfer of LTR retrotransposons in plants, and may suggest a significant role of post-transcriptional host control in the life cycles of transposable elements.
28321231	<i>JcDREB2</i>, a Physic Nut AP2/ERF Gene, Alters Plant Growth and Salinity Stress Responses in Transgenic Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Transcription factors of the AP2/ERF family play important roles in plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a physic nut AP2/ERF gene, JcDREB2, was functionally characterized. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that JcDREB2 was expressed mainly in the leaf and could be induced by abscisic acid but suppressed by gibberellin (GA) and salt. Transient expression of a JcDREB2-YFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells suggested that JcDREB2 is localized in the nucleus. Rice plants overexpressing JcDREB2 exhibited dwarf and GA-deficient phenotypes with shorter shoots and roots than those of wild-type plants. The dwarfism phenotype could be rescued by the application of exogenous GA3. The expression levels of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2, OsGA20ox4, OsGA3ox2, OsCPS1, OsKO2, and OsKAO were significantly reduced in plants overexpressing JcDREB2. Overexpression of JcDREB2 in rice increased sensitivity to salt stress. Increases in the expression levels of several salt-tolerance-related genes in response to salt stress were impaired in JcDREB2-overexpressing plants. These results demonstrated not only that JcDREB2 influences GA metabolism, but also that it can participate in the regulation of the salt stress response in rice.
28439286	SNP Discovery and Genetic Variation of Candidate Genes Relevant to Heat Tolerance and Agronomic Traits in Natural Populations of Sand Rice (<i>Agriophyllum squarrosum</i>).	2017	Front Plant Sci	The extreme stress tolerance and high nutritional value of sand rice (Agriophyllum squarrosum) make it attractive for use as an alternative crop in response to concerns about ongoing climate change and future food security. However, a lack of genetic information hinders understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the morphological and physiological adaptations of sand rice. In the present study, we sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of two individuals representing semi-arid [Naiman (NM)] and arid [Shapotou (SPT)] sand rice genotypes. A total of 105,868 pairwise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed in 24,712 Unigenes were identified among SPT and NM samples; the average SNP frequency was 0.3% (one SNP per 333 base pair). Characterization of gene annotation demonstrated that variations in genes involved in DNA recombination were associated with the survival of the NM population in the semi-arid environment. A set of genes predicted to be relevant to heat stress response and agronomic traits was functionally annotated using the accumulated knowledge from Arabidopsis and several crop plants, including rice, barley, maize, and sorghum. Four candidate genes related to heat tolerance (heat-shock transcription factor, HsfA1d), seed size (DA1-Related, DAR1), and flowering (early flowering 3, ELF3 and late elongated hypocotyl, LHY) were subjected to analysis of the genetic diversity in 10 natural populations, representing the core germplasm resource across the area of sand rice distribution in China. Only one SNP was detected in each of HsfA1d and DAR1, among 60 genotypes, with two in ELF3 and four in LHY. Nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.00032 to 0.00118. Haplotype analysis indicated that the NM population carried a specific allele for all four genes, suggesting that divergence has occurred between NM and other populations. These four genes could be further analyzed to determine whether they are associated with phenotype variation and identify alleles favorable for sand rice breeding.
28091610	Evaluation of hyperspectral LiDAR for monitoring rice leaf nitrogen by comparison with multispectral LiDAR and passive spectrometer.	2017	Sci Rep	Fast and nondestructive assessment of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is critical for crop growth diagnosis and nitrogen management guidance. In the last decade, multispectral LiDAR (MSL) systems have promoted developments in the earth and ecological sciences with the additional spectral information. With more wavelengths than MSL, the hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) system provides greater possibilities for remote sensing crop physiological conditions. This study compared the performance of ASD FieldSpec Pro FR, MSL, and HSL for estimating rice (Oryza sativa) LNC. Spectral reflectance and biochemical composition were determined in rice leaves of different cultivars (Yongyou 4949 and Yangliangyou 6) throughout two growing seasons (2014-2015). Results demonstrated that HSL provided the best indicator for predicting rice LNC, yielding a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.74 and a root mean square error of 2.80 mg/g with a support vector machine, similar to the performance of ASD (R2 = 0.73). Estimation of rice LNC could be significantly improved with the finer spectral resolution of HSL compared with MSL (R2 = 0.56).
28191468	Screening and Expression of a Silicon Transporter Gene <i>(Lsi1)</i> in Wild-Type Indica Rice Cultivars.	2017	Biomed Res Int	Silicon (Si) is one of the most prevalent elements in the soil. It is beneficial for plant growth and development, and it contributes to plant defense against different stresses. The Lsi1 gene encodes a Si transporter that was identified in a mutant Japonica rice variety. This gene was not identified in fourteen Malaysian rice varieties during screening. Then, a mutant version of Lsi1 was substituted for the native version in the three most common Malaysian rice varieties, MR219, MR220, and MR276, to evaluate the function of the transgene. Real-time PCR was used to explore the differential expression of Lsi1 in the three transgenic rice varieties. Silicon concentrations in the roots and leaves of transgenic plants were significantly higher than in wild-type plants. Transgenic varieties showed significant increases in the activities of the enzymes SOD, POD, APX, and CAT; photosynthesis; and chlorophyll content; however, the highest chlorophyll A and B levels were observed in transgenic MR276. Transgenic varieties have shown a stronger root and leaf structure, as well as hairier roots, compared to the wild-type plants. This suggests that Lsi1 plays a key role in rice, increasing the absorption and accumulation of Si, then alters antioxidant activities, and improves morphological properties.
28096805	Improving of Rice Blast Resistances in <i>Japonica</i> by Pyramiding Major R Genes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a major constraint to rice production worldwide. In this study, we developed monogenic near-isogenic lines (NILs) NIL Pi9, NIL Pizt , and NIL Pi54 carrying genes Pi9, Pizt, and Pi54, respectively, by marker assisted backcross breeding using 07GY31 as the japonica genetic background with good agronomic traits. Polygene pyramid lines (PPLs) PPL Pi9+Pi54 combining Pi9 with Pi54, and PPL Pizt+Pi54 combining Pizt with Pi54 were then developed using corresponding NILs with genetic background recovery rates of more than 97%. Compared to 07GY31, the above NILs and PPLs exhibited significantly enhanced resistance frequencies (RFs) for both leaf and panicle blasts. RFs of both PPLs for leaf blast were somewhat higher than those of their own parental NILs, respectively, and PPL Pizt+Pi54 exhibited higher RF for panicle blast than NIL Pizt and NIL Pi54 (P < 0.001), hinting an additive effect on the resistance. However, PPL Pi9+Pi54 exhibited lower RF for panicle blast than NIL Pi9 (P < 0.001), failing to realize an additive effect. PPL Pizt+Pi54 showed higher resistant level for panicle blast and better additive effects on the resistance than PPL Pi9+Pi54. It was suggested that major R genes interacted with each other in a way more complex than additive effect in determining panicle blast resistance levels. Genotyping by sequencing analysis and extreme-phenotype genome-wide association study further confirmed the above results. Moreover, data showed that pyramiding multiple resistance genes did not affect the performance of basic agronomic traits. So the way to enhance levels of leaf and panicle blast resistances for rice breeding in this study is effective and may serve as a reference for breeders. Key Message: Resistant levels of rice blast is resulted from different combinations of major R genes, PPL Pizt+Pi54 showed higher resistant level and better additive effects on the panicle blast resistance than PPL Pi9+Pi54.
28278154	Harnessing the hidden genetic diversity for improving multiple abiotic stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	PLoS One	To develop superior rice varieties with improved yield in most rainfed areas of Asia/Africa, we started an introgression-breeding program for simultaneously improving yield and tolerances of multiple abiotic stresses. Using eight BC1 populations derived from a widely adaptable recipient and eight donors plus three rounds of phenotypic selection, we developed 496 introgression lines (ILs) with significantly higher yield under drought, salt and/or non-stress conditions in 5 years. Six new varieties were released in the Philippines and Pakistan and many more are being evaluated in multi-location yield trials for releasing in several countries. Marker-facilitated genetic characterization revealed three interesting aspects of the breeding procedure: (1) the donor introgression pattern in specific BC populations was characteristic; (2) introgression frequency in different genomic regions varied considerably, resulting primarily from strong selection for the target traits; and (3) significantly lower heterozygosity was observed in BC progenies selected for drought and salinity tolerance. Applying strong phenotypic selection under abiotic stresses in early segregating generations has major advantages for not only improving multiple abiotic stress tolerance but also achieving quicker homozygosity in early generations. This breeding procedure can be easily adopted by small breeding programs in developing countries to develop high-yielding varieties tolerant of abiotic stresses. The large set of trait-specific ILs can be used for genetic mapping of genes/QTL that affect target and non-target traits and for efficient varietal development by designed QTL pyramiding and genomics-based recurrent selection in our Green Super Rice breeding technology.
28144248	Osa-miR169 Negatively Regulates Rice Immunity against the Blast Fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.	2017	Front Plant Sci	miR169 is a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family involved in plant development and stress-induced responses. However, how miR169 functions in rice immunity remains unclear. Here, we show that miR169 acts as a negative regulator in rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by repressing the expression of nuclear factor Y-A (NF-YA) genes. The accumulation of miR169 was significantly increased in a susceptible accession but slightly fluctuated in a resistant accession upon M. oryzae infection. Consistently, the transgenic lines overexpressing miR169a became hyper-susceptible to different M. oryzae strains associated with reduced expression of defense-related genes and lack of hydrogen peroxide accumulation at the infection site. Consequently, the expression of its target genes, the NF-YA family members, was down-regulated by the overexpression of miR169a at either transcriptional or translational level. On the contrary, overexpression of a target mimicry that acts as a sponge to trap miR169a led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae. In addition, three of miR169's target genes were also differentially up-regulated in the resistant accession upon M. oryzae infection. Taken together, our data indicate that miR169 negatively regulates rice immunity against M. oryzae by differentially repressing its target genes and provide the potential to engineer rice blast resistance via a miRNA.
28139777	Isolation and characterization of a spotted leaf 32 mutant with early leaf senescence and enhanced defense response in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Leaf senescence is a complex biological process and defense responses play vital role for rice development, their molecular mechanisms, however, remain elusive in rice. We herein reported a rice mutant spotted leaf 32 (spl32) derived from a rice cultivar 9311 by radiation. The spl32 plants displayed early leaf senescence, identified by disintegration of chloroplasts as cellular evidence, dramatically decreased contents of chlorophyll, up-regulation of superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and malondialdehyde, as physiological characteristic, and both up-regulation of senescence-induced STAY GREEN gene and senescence-associated transcription factors, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-associated genes, as molecular indicators. Positional cloning revealed that SPL32 encodes a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT). Compared to wild type, enzyme activity of GOGAT was significantly decreased, and free amino acid contents, particularly for glutamate and glutamine, were altered in spl32 leaves. Moreover, the mutant was subjected to uncontrolled oxidative stress due to over-produced reactive oxygen species and damaged scavenging pathways, in accordance with decreased photorespiration rate. Besides, the mutant showed higher resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae than its wild type, coupled with up-regulation of four pathogenesis-related marker genes. Taken together, our results highlight Fd-GOGAT is associated with the regulation of leaf senescence and defense responses in rice.
28377781	Laser Irradiation-Induced DNA Methylation Changes Are Heritable and Accompanied with Transpositional Activation of <i>mPing</i> in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	DNA methylation is an integral component of the epigenetic code in most higher eukaryotes. Exploring the extent to which DNA methylation can be altered under a specific condition and its heritability is important for elucidating the biological functions of this epigenetic modification. Here, we conducted MSAP analysis of rice plants with altered phenotypes subsequent to a low-dose Nd3+YAG laser irradiation. We found that all four methylation patterns at the 5'-CCGG sites that are analyzable by MSAP showed substantial changes in the immediately treated M0 plants. Interestingly, the frequencies of hypo- and hypermethylation were of similar extents, which largely offset each other and render the total methylation levels unchanged. Further analysis revealed that the altered methylation patterns were meiotically heritable to at least the M2 generation but accompanied with further changes in each generation. The methylation changes and their heritability of the metastable epigenetic state were verified by bisulfite sequencing of portion of the retrotranspon, Tos17, an established locus for assessing DNA methylation liability in rice. Real-time PCR assay indicated that the expression of various methylation-related chromatin genes was perturbed, and a Pearson correlation analysis showed that many of these genes, especially two AGOs (AGO4-1 and AGO4-2), were significantly correlated with the methylation pattern alterations. In addition, excisions of a MITE transposon, mPing, occurred rampantly in the laser irradiated plants and their progenies. Together, our results indicate that heritable DNA methylation changes can be readily induced by low-dose laser irradiation, and which can be accompanied by transpostional activation of transposable elements.
28085154	Genomic reconstruction of multiple lineages of uncultured benthic archaea suggests distinct biogeochemical roles and ecological niches.	2017	ISME J	Genomic bins belonging to multiple archaeal lineages were recovered from distinct redox regimes in sediments of the White Oak River estuary. The reconstructed archaeal genomes were identified as belonging to the rice cluster subgroups III and V (RC-III, RC-V), the Marine Benthic Group D (MBG-D), and a newly described archaeal class, the Theionarchaea. The metabolic capabilities of these uncultured archaea were inferred and indicated a common capability for extracellular protein degradation, supplemented by other pathways. The multiple genomic bins within the MBG-D archaea shared a nearly complete reductive acetyl-CoA pathway suggesting acetogenic capabilities. In contrast, the RC-III metabolism appeared centered on the degradation of detrital proteins and production of H2, whereas the RC-V archaea lacked capabilities for protein degradation and uptake, and appeared to be specialized on carbohydrate fermentation. The Theionarchaea appeared as complex metabolic hybrids; encoding a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle permitting carbon (acetyl-CoA) oxidation, together with a complete reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and sulfur reduction by a sulfhydrogenase. The differentiated inferred capabilities of these uncultured archaeal lineages indicated lineage-specific linkages with the nitrogen, carbon and sulfur cycles. The predicted metabolisms of these archaea suggest preferences for distinct geochemical niches within the estuarine sedimentary environment.
28107733	Glycine increases cold tolerance in rice via the regulation of N uptake, physiological characteristics, and photosynthesis.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	To investigate the response of rice growth and photosynthesis to different nitrogen (N) sources under cold stress, hydroponic cultivation of rice was done in greenhouse, with glycine, ammonium, and nitrate as the sole N sources. The results demonstrate that exposure to low temperature reduced the rice biomass and leaf chlorophyll content, but their values in the glycine-treated plants were significantly higher than in the ammonium- and nitrate-treated plants. This might be attributed to the higher N uptake rate and root area and activity in the glycine-treated plants. The glycine-treated plants also maintained high contents of soluble proteins, soluble sugars, and proline as well as enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities to protect themselves against chilling injury. Under cold stress, reduced stomatal conductance (gs) and effective quantum efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) significantly inhibited the leaf photosynthesis; however, glycine treatment alleviated these effects compared to the ammonium and nitrate treatments. The high non-photochemical quenching (qN) and excess energy dissipative energy (Ex) in the glycine-treated plants were beneficial for the release of extra energy, thereby, strengthening their photochemical efficiency. We, therefore, conclude that the strengthened cold tolerance of glycine-treated rice plants was closely associated with the higher accumulation of dry matter and photosynthesis through the up-regulation of N-uptake, and increase in the content of osmoprotectants, activities of the antioxidant defense enzymes, and photochemical efficiency. The results of the present study provide new ideas for improving the plant tolerance to extreme temperatures by nutrient resource management in the cold regions.
27896367	Erratum to: Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of qHD5, a novel major QTL with pleiotropism for yield-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Theor Appl Genet	
28128411	Genetic analysis and identification of SSR markers associated with rice blast disease in a BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> backcross population.	2017	Genet Mol Res	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease is one of the most destructive rice diseases in the world. The fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, is the causal agent of rice blast disease. Development of resistant cultivars is the most preferred method to achieve sustainable rice production. However, the effectiveness of resistant cultivars is hindered by the genetic plasticity of the pathogen genome. Therefore, information on genetic resistance and virulence stability are vital to increase our understanding of the molecular basis of blast disease resistance. The present study set out to elucidate the resistance pattern and identify potential simple sequence repeat markers linked with rice blast disease. A backcross population (BC2F1), derived from crossing MR264 and Pongsu Seribu 2 (PS2), was developed using marker-assisted backcross breeding. Twelve microsatellite markers carrying the blast resistance gene clearly demonstrated a polymorphic pattern between both parental lines. Among these, two markers, RM206 and RM5961, located on chromosome 11 exhibited the expected 1:1 testcross ratio in the BC2F1 population. The 195 BC2F1 plants inoculated against M. oryzae pathotype P7.2 showed a significantly different distribution in the backcrossed generation and followed Mendelian segregation based on a single-gene model. This indicates that blast resistance in PS2 is governed by a single dominant gene, which is linked to RM206 and RM5961 on chromosome 11. The findings presented in this study could be useful for future blast resistance studies in rice breeding programs.
28419172	Enhanced disease resistance and drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants overexpressing protein elicitors from Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	PLoS One	Exogenous application of the protein elicitors MoHrip1 and MoHrip2, which were isolated from the pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae), was previously shown to induce a hypersensitive response in tobacco and to enhance resistance to rice blast. In this work, we successfully transformed rice with the mohrip1 and mohrip2 genes separately. The MoHrip1 and MoHrip2 transgenic rice plants displayed higher resistance to rice blast and stronger tolerance to drought stress than wild-type (WT) rice and the vector-control pCXUN rice. The expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes was also increased, suggesting that these two elicitors may trigger SA signaling to protect the rice from damage during pathogen infection and regulate the ABA content to increase drought tolerance in transgenic rice. Trypan blue staining indicated that expressing MoHrip1 and MoHrip2 in rice plants inhibited hyphal growth of the rice blast fungus. Relative water content (RWC), water usage efficiency (WUE) and water loss rate (WLR) were measured to confirm the high capacity for water retention in transgenic rice. The MoHrip1 and MoHrip2 transgenic rice also exhibited enhanced agronomic traits such as increased plant height and tiller number.
28392792	A Phylogenetically Informed Comparison of GH1 Hydrolases between Arabidopsis and Rice Response to Stressors.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Glycoside hydrolases Family 1 (GH1) comprises enzymes that can hydrolyze β-O-glycosidic bond from a carbohydrate moiety. The plant GH1 hydrolases participate in a number of developmental processes and stress responses, including cell wall modification, plant hormone activation or deactivation and herbivore resistance. A large number of members has been observed in this family, suggesting their potential redundant functions in various biological processes. In this study, we have used 304 sequences of plant GH1 hydrolases to study the evolution of this gene family in plant lineage. Gene duplication was found to be a common phenomenon in this gene family. Although many members of GH1 hydrolases showed a high degree of similarity in Arabidopsis and rice, they showed substantial tissue specificity and differential responses to various stress treatments. This differential regulation implies each enzyme may play a distinct role in plants. Furthermore, some of salt-responsive Arabidopsis GH1 hydrolases were selected to test their genetic involvement in salt responses. The knockout mutants of AtBGLU1 and AtBGLU19 were observed to be less-sensitive during NaCl treatment in comparison to the wild type seedlings, indicating their participation in salt stress response. In summary, Arabidopsis and rice GH1 glycoside hydrolases showed distinct features in their evolutionary path, transcriptional regulation and genetic functions.
28369122	Molecular actions of two synthetic brassinosteroids, iso-carbaBL and 6-deoxoBL, which cause altered physiological activities between Arabidopsis and rice.	2017	PLoS One	Brassinosteroid (BR) is an important plant hormone that is perceived by the BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) receptor. BRI1 is conserved among dicot and monocot species; however, the molecular mechanism underlying BR perception in monocots is not fully understood. We synthesised two BRs, iso-carbabrassinolide (iso-carbaBL) and 6-deoxoBL, which have different BR activities in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and rice. Our bioassay indicated that iso-carbaBL has relatively strong BR activity in Arabidopsis, but is inactive in rice and competitively inhibits BR activity. The bioactivity of 6-deoxoBL was similar to that of BL in Arabidopsis, but was much lower in rice. Binding experiments using recombinant Arabidopsis and rice BRI1 protein fragments suggested that iso-carbaBL and 6-deoxoBL bind to both receptors. These results showed that iso-carbaBL and 6-deoxoBL act as an antagonist and agonist, respectively, of BRs in rice. A docking simulation analysis suggested that iso-carbaBL fits deeper in the binding pocket to block the binding of active BR to rice BRI1. The simulated binding energy of 6-deoxoBL with rice BRI1 is much lower than that with Arabidopsis BRI1. The possible structural characteristics of rice BRI1 were determined based on the difference in the BR activities of iso-carbaBL and 6-deoxoBL in Arabidopsis and rice.
28282385	Genetic architecture of cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) determined through high resolution genome-wide analysis.	2017	PLoS One	Cold temperature is an important abiotic stress which negatively affects morphological development and seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). At the seedling stage, cold stress causes poor germination, seedling injury and poor stand establishment; and at the reproductive stage cold decreases seed yield. The Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) is a global collection of over 400 O. sativa accessions representing the five major subpopulations from the INDICA and JAPONICA varietal groups, with a genotypic dataset consisting of 700,000 SNP markers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the RDP1 accessions for the complex, quantitatively inherited cold tolerance traits at the germination and reproductive stages, and to conduct genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify SNPs and candidate genes associated with cold stress at these stages. GWA mapping of the germination index (calculated as percent germination in cold divided by warm treatment) revealed 42 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with cold tolerance at the seedling stage, including 18 in the panel as a whole, seven in temperate japonica, six in tropical japonica, 14 in JAPONICA, and nine in INDICA, with five shared across all subpopulations. Twenty-two of these QTLs co-localized with 32 previously reported cold tolerance QTLs. GWA mapping of cold tolerance at the reproductive stage detected 29 QTLs, including seven associated with percent sterility, ten with seed weight per panicle, 14 with seed weight per plant and one region overlapping for two traits. Fifteen co-localized with previously reported QTLs for cold tolerance or yield components. Candidate gene ontology searches revealed these QTLs were associated with significant enrichment for genes related to with lipid metabolism, response to stimuli, response to biotic stimuli (suggesting cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stresses), and oxygen binding. Overall the JAPONICA accessions were more tolerant to cold stress than INDICA accessions.
28361000	Rethinking the approach to viability monitoring in seed genebanks.	2017	Conserv Physiol	Seed viability monitoring, usually through a germination test, is a key aspect of genebank management; a low viability result triggers the regeneration of an accession in order to ensure that the genetic diversity of the accession is conserved and available for distribution. However, regular viability monitoring of large collections is costly in terms of seeds, labour and other resources. Genebanks differ in how they conduct their viability monitoring and how they collect, manage and store the data that are generated. In this article, we propose alternatives to the current norm of conducting an initial germination test soon after arrival at the genebank and then testing after regular, set storage intervals, as recommended in the Food and Agriculture Organization's Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. We use real data from the International Rice Genebank (held at the International Rice Research Institute) to illustrate some of the issues regarding the accuracy and reliability of germination test results, in particular when they are used to predict the longevity of a seed lot in storage and to set viability monitoring intervals. We suggest the use of seed storage experiments on samples of seeds to identify which seed lots from a particular crop season to test first. We also give advice on the use of sequential testing schemes potentially to reduce the number of seeds used for viability testing; the use of tolerance tables to identify unlikely results when samples are subdivided into replicates; and what data to include in a genebank management database to improve the management of seed collections.
28367158	Heat-Induced Cytokinin Transportation and Degradation Are Associated with Reduced Panicle Cytokinin Expression and Fewer Spikelets per Panicle in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Cytokinins (CTKs) regulate panicle size and mediate heat tolerance in crops. To investigate the effect of high temperature on panicle CTK expression and the role of such expression in panicle differentiation in rice, four rice varieties (Nagina22, N22; Huanghuazhan, HHZ; Liangyoupeijiu, LYPJ; and Shanyou63, SY63) were grown under normal conditions and subjected to three high temperature treatments and one control treatment in temperature-controlled greenhouses for 15 days during the early reproductive stage. The high temperature treatments significantly reduced panicle CTK abundance in heat-susceptible LYPJ, HHZ, and N22 varieties, which showed fewer spikelets per panicle in comparison with control plants. Exogenous 6-benzylaminopurine application mitigated the effect of heat injury on the number of spikelets per panicle. The high temperature treatments significantly decreased the xylem sap flow rate and CTK transportation rate, but enhanced cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) activity in heat-susceptible varieties. In comparison with the heat-susceptible varieties, heat-tolerant variety SY63 showed less reduction in panicle CTK abundance, an enhanced xylem sap flow rate, an improved CTK transport rate, and stable CKX activity under the high temperature treatments. Enzymes involved in CTK synthesis (isopentenyltransferase, LONELY GUY, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) were inhibited by the high temperature treatments. Heat-induced changes in CTK transportation from root to shoot through xylem sap flow and panicle CTK degradation via CKX were closely associated with the effects of heat on panicle CTK abundance and panicle size. Heat-tolerant variety SY63 showed stable panicle size under the high temperature treatments because of enhanced transport of root-derived CTKs and stable panicle CKX activity. Our results provide insight into rice heat tolerance that will facilitate the development of rice varieties with tolerance to high temperature.
28128414	Cytotoxicity evaluation of the whole protein extract from Bar-transgenic rice on Mus musculus lymphocytes.	2017	Genet Mol Res	With the expanding demand for genetically modified (GM) rice, its safety evaluation is of great significance. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the acute cytotoxicity of the whole protein extract from GM rice Bar68-1 in Mus musculus lymphocytes in vitro. Cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) tests. CCK-8 tests was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell dehydrogenase (catalytic redox enzymes) activity was spectrophotometrically determined at 450 nm. The tests result were recorded immediately. NRU tests were completed under yellow light in a dark room according to an improved protocol. Lysosomal uptake of neutral red was spectrophotometrically determined at 540 nm and the results were recorded immediately. The results showed that the survival rate of M. musculus lymphocytes in the positive control group was significantly less than in the blank control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, an exposure- time-effect relationship was observed in the positive control group with CCK-8 and NRU tests. There was no significant difference in survival rate between GM rice Bar68-1group and non-GM rice D68 group (P > 0.05). The GM rice Bar68-1 group also did not show a higher survival rate than non-GM rice D68 group (P > 0.05). These results suggested that the whole protein extract from Bar68-1 and D68 were equivalent in their cytotoxicity, and GM rice Bar68-1 had no acute cytotoxic effect on M. musculus lymphocytes in vitro.
28098179	A salivary EF-hand calcium-binding protein of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens functions as an effector for defense responses in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), a major pest of rice in Asia, is able to successfully puncture sieve tubes in rice with its piercing stylet and then to ingest phloem sap. How BPH manages to continuously feed on rice remains unclear. Here, we cloned the gene NlSEF1, which is highly expressed in the salivary glands of BPH. The NlSEF1 protein has EF-hand Ca2+-binding activity and can be secreted into rice plants when BPH feed. Infestation of rice by BPH nymphs whose NlSEF1 was knocked down elicited higher levels of Ca2+ and H2O2 but not jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and SA in rice than did infestation by control nymphs; Consistently, wounding plus the recombination protein NlSEF1 suppressed the production of H2O2 in rice. Bioassays revealed that NlSEF1-knockdown BPH nymphs had a higher mortality rate and lower feeding capacity on rice than control nymphs. These results indicate that the salivary protein in BPH, NlSEF1, functions as an effector and plays important roles in interactions between BPH and rice by mediating the plant's defense responses.
28116312	Chemopreventive Effects of Germinated Rough Rice Crude Extract in Inhibiting Azoxymethane-Induced Aberrant Crypt Foci Formation in <i>Sprague-Dawley</i> Rats.	2017	Biomed Res Int	Chemoprevention has become an important area in cancer research due to low success rate of current therapeutic modalities. Diet plays a vital role in the etiology of cancer. This research was carried out to study the chemopreventive properties of germinated rough rice (GRR) crude extract in Sprague-Dawley rats induced with azoxymethane. Germination of rough rice causes significant changes in several chemical compositions of presently bioactive compounds. These compounds may prevent or postpone the inception of cancer. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks of age) were randomly divided into 5 groups which were (G1) induced with azoxymethane (AOM) and not given GRR (positive control), (G2) induced with AOM and given 2000 mg/kg GRR, (G3) induced with AOM and given 1000 mg/kg GRR, (G4) induced with AOM and given 500 mg/kg GRR, and (G5) not induced with AOM and not given GRR crude extract (negative control). To induce colon cancer, rats received two IP injections of AOM in saline (15 mg/kg) for two subsequent weeks. Organs were removed and weighed. Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were evaluated histopathologically. β-Catenin expressions were determined by Western blot. Treatment with 2000 mg/kg GRR crude extract not only resulted in the greatest reduction in the size and number of ACF but also displayed the highest percentage of nondysplastic ACF. Treatment with 2000 mg/kg GRR also gave the lowest level of expression in β-catenin. Thus, GRR could be a promising dietary supplement for prevention of CRC.
28326093	The Complete Chloroplast Genome of Wild Rice (<i>Oryza minuta</i>) and Its Comparison to Related Species.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Oryza minuta, a tetraploid wild relative of cultivated rice (family Poaceae), possesses a BBCC genome and contains genes that confer resistance to bacterial blight (BB) and white-backed (WBPH) and brown (BPH) plant hoppers. Based on the importance of this wild species, this study aimed to understand the phylogenetic relationships of O. minuta with other Oryza species through an in-depth analysis of the composition and diversity of the chloroplast (cp) genome. The analysis revealed a cp genome size of 135,094 bp with a typical quadripartite structure and consisting of a pair of inverted repeats separated by small and large single copies, 139 representative genes, and 419 randomly distributed microsatellites. The genomic organization, gene order, GC content and codon usage are similar to those of typical angiosperm cp genomes. Approximately 30 forward, 28 tandem and 20 palindromic repeats were detected in the O. minuta cp genome. Comparison of the complete O. minuta cp genome with another eleven Oryza species showed a high degree of sequence similarity and relatively high divergence of intergenic spacers. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the complete genome sequence, 65 shared genes and matK gene showed same topologies and O. minuta forms a single clade with parental O. punctata. Thus, the complete O. minuta cp genome provides interesting insights and valuable information that can be used to identify related species and reconstruct its phylogeny.
28445532	Use of molecular markers in identification and characterization of resistance to rice blast in India.	2017	PLoS One	Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive disease causing huge losses to rice yield in different parts of the world. Therefore, an attempt has been made to find out the resistance by screening and studying the genetic diversity of eighty released rice varieties by National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack (NRVs) using molecular markers linked to twelve major blast resistance (R) genes viz Pib, Piz, Piz-t, Pik, Pik-p, Pikm Pik-h, Pita/Pita-2, Pi2, Pi9, Pi1 and Pi5. Out of which, nineteen varieties (23.75%) showed resistance, twenty one were moderately resistant (26.25%) while remaining forty varieties (50%) showed susceptible in uniform blast nursery. Rice varieties possessing blast resistance genes varied from four to twelve and the frequencies of the resistance genes ranged from 0 to 100%. The cluster analysis grouped the eighty NRVs into two major clusters at 63% level of genetic similarity coefficient. The PIC value for seventeen markers varied from 0 to 0.37 at an average of 0.20. Out of seventeen markers, only five markers, 195R-1, Pi9-i, Pita3, YL155/YL87 and 40N23r corresponded to three broad spectrum R genes viz. Pi9, Pita/Pita2 and Pi5 were found to be significantly associated with the blast disease with explaining phenotypic variance from 3.5% to 7.7%. The population structure analysis and PCoA divided the entire 80 NRVs into two sub-groups. The outcome of this study would help to formulate strategies for improving rice blast resistance through genetic studies, plant-pathogen interaction, identification of novel R genes, development of new resistant varieties through marker-assisted breeding for improving rice blast resistance in India and worldwide.
28110460	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Three-line Oryza sativa (ssp. japonica) hybrids have been developed mainly using Chinsurah Boro II (BT)-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). The Rf1 gene restores the fertility of BT-type CMS lines, and is the only fertility restorer gene (Rf) that has been used to produce three-line japonica hybrids. Using more Rf genes to breed BT-type restorer lines may broaden the genetic diversity of the restorer lines, and represents a viable approach to improve the heterosis level of BT-type japonica hybrids.

RESULTS: We identified two major Rf genes from '93-11' that are involved in restoring the fertility of BT-type CMS plants. These genes were identified from resequenced chromosome segment substitution lines derived from a cross between the japonica variety 'Nipponbare' and the indica variety '93-11'. Molecular mapping results revealed that these genes were Rf5 and Rf6, which are the Rf genes that restore fertility to Honglian-type CMS lines. The BT-type F1 hybrids with either Rf5 or Rf6 exhibited normal seed setting rates, but F1 plants carrying Rf6 showed more stable seed setting rates than those of plants carrying Rf5 under heat-stress conditions. Furthermore, the seed setting rates of F1 hybrids carrying both Rf5 and Rf6 were more stable than that of F1 plants carrying only one Rf gene.

CONCLUSION: Rf6 is an important genetic resource for the breeding of BT-type japonica restorer lines. Our findings may be useful for breeders interested in developing BT-type japonica hybrids.
28149498	Differences in meristem size and expression of branching genes are associated with variation in panicle phenotype in wild and domesticated African rice.	2017	Evodevo	BACKGROUND: The African rice Oryza glaberrima was domesticated from its wild relative Oryza barthii about 3000 years ago. During the domestication process, panicle complexity changed from a panicle with low complexity in O. barthii, to a highly branched panicle carrying more seeds in O. glaberrima. To understand the basis of this differential panicle development between the two species, we conducted morphological and molecular analyses of early panicle development.

RESULTS: Using X-ray tomography, we analyzed the morphological basis of early developmental stages of panicle development. We uncovered evidence for a wider rachis meristem in O. glaberrima than in O. barthii. At the molecular level, spatial and temporal expression profiles of orthologs of O. sativa genes related to meristem activity and meristem fate control were obtained using in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR. Despite highly conserved spatial expression patterns between O. glaberrima and O. barthii, differences in the expression levels of these early acting genes were detected.

CONCLUSION: The higher complexity of the O. glaberrima panicle compared to that of its wild relative O. barthii is associated with a wider rachis meristem and a modification of expression of branching-related genes. Our study indicates that the expression of genes in the miR156/miR529/SPL and TAW1 pathways, along with that of their target genes, is altered from the unbranched stage of development. This suggests that differences in panicle complexity between the two African rice species result from early alterations to gene expression during reproductive development.
28178571	Genome-wide identification and analysis of biotic and abiotic stress regulation of small heat shock protein (HSP20) family genes in bread wheat.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs)/HSP20 are molecular chaperones that protect plants by preventing protein aggregation during abiotic stress conditions, especially heat stress. Due to global climate change, high temperature is emerging as a major threat to wheat productivity. Thus, the identification of HSP20 and analysis of HSP transcriptional regulation under different abiotic stresses in wheat would help in understanding the role of these proteins in abiotic stress tolerance. We used sequences of known rice and Arabidopsis HSP20 HMM profiles as queries against publicly available wheat genome and wheat full length cDNA databases (TriFLDB) to identify the respective orthologues from wheat. 163 TaHSP20 (including 109 sHSP and 54 ACD) genes were identified and classified according to the sub-cellular localization and phylogenetic relationship with sequenced grass genomes (Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, Brachypodium distachyon and Setaria italica). Spatio-temporal, biotic and abiotic stress-specific expression patterns in normalized RNA seq and wheat array datasets revealed constitutive as well as inductive responses of HSP20 in different tissues and developmental stages of wheat. Promoter analysis of TaHSP20 genes showed the presence of tissue-specific, biotic, abiotic, light-responsive, circadian and cell cycle-responsive cis-regulatory elements. 14 TaHSP20 family genes were under the regulation of 8 TamiRNA genes. The expression levels of twelve HSP20 genes were studied under abiotic stress conditions in the drought- and heat-tolerant wheat genotype C306. Of the 13 TaHSP20 genes, TaHSP16.9H-CI showed high constitutive expression with upregulation only under salt stress. Both heat and salt stresses upregulated the expression of TaHSP17.4-CI, TaHSP17.7A-CI, TaHSP19.1-CIII, TaACD20.0B-CII and TaACD20.6C-CIV, while TaHSP23.7-MTI was specifically induced only under heat stress. Our results showed that the identified TaHSP20 genes play an important role under different abiotic stress conditions. Thus, the results illustrate the complexity of the TaHSP20 gene family and its stress regulation in wheat, and suggest that sHSPs as attractive breeding targets for improvement of the heat tolerance of wheat.
28056797	Comparative proteomic analysis reveals a dynamic pollen plasma membrane protein map and the membrane landscape of receptor-like kinases and transporters important for pollen tube growth and interaction with pistils in rice.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The coordination of pollen tube (PT) growth, guidance and timely growth arrest and rupture mediated by PT-pistil interaction is crucial for the PT to transport sperm cells into ovules for double fertilization. The plasma membrane (PM) represents an important interface for cell-cell interaction, and PM proteins of PTs are pioneers for mediating PT integrity and interaction with pistils. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying these events is important for proteomics.

RESULTS: Using the efficient aqueous polymer two-phase system and alkali buffer treatment, we prepared high-purity PM from mature and germinated pollen of rice. We used iTRAQ quantitative proteomic methods and identified 1,121 PM-related proteins (PMrPs) (matched to 899 loci); 192 showed differential expression in the two pollen cell types, 119 increased and 73 decreased in abundance during germination. The PMrP and differentially expressed PMrP sets all showed a functional skew toward signal transduction, transporters, wall remodeling/metabolism and membrane trafficking. Their genomic loci had strong chromosome bias. We found 37 receptor-like kinases (RLKs) from 8 kinase subfamilies and 209 transporters involved in flux of diversified ions and metabolites. In combination with the rice pollen transcriptome data, we revealed that in general, the protein expression of these PMrPs disagreed with their mRNA expression, with inconsistent mRNA expression for 74% of differentially expressed PMrPs.

CONCLUSIONS: This study identified genome-wide pollen PMrPs, and provided insights into the membrane profile of receptor-like kinases and transporters important for pollen tube growth and interaction with pistils. These pollen PMrPs and their mRNAs showed discordant expression. This work provides resource and knowledge to further dissect mechanisms by which pollen or the PT controls PMrP abundance and monitors interactions and ion and metabolite exchanges with female cells in rice.
28134995	An operon for production of bioactive gibberellin A<sub>4</sub> phytohormone with wide distribution in the bacterial rice leaf streak pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2017	New Phytol	Phytopathogens have developed elaborate mechanisms to attenuate the defense response of their host plants, including convergent evolution of complex pathways for production of the GA phytohormones, which were actually first isolated from the rice fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi. The rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) has been demonstrated to contain a biosynthetic operon with cyclases capable of producing the universal GA precursor ent-kaurene. Genetic (knock-out) studies indicate that the derived diterpenoid serves as a virulence factor for this rice leaf streak pathogen, serving to reduce the jasmonic acid-mediated defense response. Here the functions of the remaining genes in the Xoc operon are elucidated and the distribution of the operon in X. oryzae is investigated in over 100 isolates. The Xoc operon leads to production of the bioactive GA4 , an additional step beyond production of the penultimate precursor GA9 mediated by the homologous operons recently characterized from rhizobia. Moreover, this GA biosynthetic operon was found to be widespread in Xoc (> 90%), but absent in the other major X. oryzae pathovar. These results indicate selective pressure for production of GA4 in the distinct lifestyle of Xoc, and the importance of GA to both fungal and bacterial pathogens of rice.
28291806	Effects of silicon on Oryza sativa L. seedling roots under simulated acid rain stress.	2017	PLoS One	Silicon (Si) has an important function in reducing the damage of environmental stress on plants. Acid rain is a serious abiotic stress factor, and Si can alleviate the stress induced by acid rain on plants. Based on these assumptions, we investigated the effects of silicon on the growth, root phenotype, mineral element contents, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and antioxidative enzymes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedling roots under simulated acid rain (SAR) stress. The results showed that the combined or single effects of Si and/or SAR on rice roots depend on the concentration of Si and the pH of the SAR. The combined or single effects of a low or moderate concentration of Si (1.0 or 2.0 mM) and light SAR (pH 4.0) enhanced the growth of rice roots, and the combined effects were stronger than those of the single treatment. A high concentration of Si (4.0 mM) or severe SAR (pH 2.0) exerted deleterious effects. The incorporation of Si (1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mM) into SAR with pH 3.0 or 2.0 promoted the rice root growth, decreased the H2O2 content, increased the Si concentration and the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, maintained the balance of mineral element (K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Cu) concentrations in the roots of rice seedlings compared with SAR alone. The alleviatory effects observed with a moderate concentration of Si (2.0 mM) were better than the effects obtained with a low or high concentration of Si (1.0 or 4.0 mM). The observed effects were due to disruptions in the absorption and utilization of mineral nutrients and impacts on the activity of antioxidant enzymes in roots, and this conclusion suggests that the degree of rice root damage caused by acid rain might be attributed to not only acid rain but also the level of Si in the soil.
28174587	Integrating Small RNA Sequencing with QTL Mapping for Identification of miRNAs and Their Target Genes Associated with Heat Tolerance at the Flowering Stage in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Although, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be associated with heat tolerance at the seedling stage in rice, their involvement in heat tolerance at the flowering stage is still unknown. In this study, small RNA profiling was conducted in a heat-tolerant variety Gan-Xiang-Nuo (GXN) and a heat-sensitive variety Hua-Jing-Xian-74 (HJX), respectively. Totally, 102 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) under heat stress. Compared to HJX, GXN had more DE miRNAs and its DE miRNAs changed earlier under heat stress. Plant Ontology (PO) analysis of the target genes revealed that many DE miRNAs were involved in flower development. As a parallel experiment, QTL mapping was also conducted and four QTLs for heat tolerance at the flowering stage were identified using chromosome single-segment substitution lines derived from GXN and HJX. Further, through integrating analysis of DE miRNAs with QTLs, we identified 8 target genes corresponding to 26 miRNAs within the four QTL regions. Some meaningful target genes such as LOC_Os12g42400, SGT1, and pectinesterase were within the QTL regions. The negative correlation between miR169r-5p and its target gene LOC_Os12g42400 was confirmed under heat stress, and overexpression of miR169r-5p enhanced heat tolerance at flowering stage in rice. Our results demonstrate that the integrated analysis of genome-wide miRNA profiling with QTL mapping can facilitate identification of miRNAs and their target genes associated with the target traits and the limited candidates identified in this study offer an important source for further functional analysis and molecular breeding for heat tolerance in rice.
28113076	Expression of FlHMA3, a P<sub>1B2</sub>-ATPase from Festulolium loliaceum, correlates with response to cadmium stress.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Heavy metal ATPase 3 (HMA3), a P1B2-ATPase, is a key tonoplast transporter involved in mediating the vacuolar sequestration of cadmium (Cd) to detoxify the intake of this element by plants. HMA3 expression in response to Cd stress has not been previously examined in the grass hybrid species Festulolium loliaceum (Huds.) P. Fourn. In this study, FlHMA3 isolated from F. loliaceum was found to comprise 833 amino acid residues with 77% homology to the rice OsHMA3. Transient expression of FlHMA3 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts suggested its localization to vacuolar membranes. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of F. loliaceum revealed that FlHMA3 is expressed predominantly within roots and up-regulated by excess Cd. Over the 168 h treatment, Cd content of F. loliaceum roots was significantly higher than that of shoots, regardless of external CdCl2 concentrations. A significant positive correlation was found between FlHMA3 expression and Cd accumulation in roots of F. loliaceum seedlings subjected to 10-100 mg L-1 CdCl2 for 168 h or, in a separate experiment, to 25 or 100 mg L-1 CdCl2 for the same duration. These findings provide evidence that FlHMA3 encodes a vacuolar P1B2-ATPase that may play an important role in Cd2+ sequestration into root cell vacuoles, thereby limiting the entry of Cd2+ into the cytoplasm and reducing Cd2+ toxicity.
28494021	Rice black streaked dwarf virus P7-2 forms a SCF complex through binding to Oryza sativa SKP1-like proteins, and interacts with GID2 involved in the gibberellin pathway.	2017	PLoS One	As a core subunit of the SCF complex that promotes protein degradation through the 26S proteasome, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes in eukaryotes, including gibberellin (GA), jasmonate, ethylene, auxin and light responses. P7-2 encoded by Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a devastating viral pathogen that causes severe symptoms in infected plants, interacts with SKP1 from different plants. However, whether RBSDV P7-2 forms a SCF complex and targets host proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid assays to further explore the interactions between P7-2 and 25 type I Oryza sativa SKP1-like (OSK) proteins, and found that P7-2 interacted with eight OSK members with different binding affinity. Co-immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the interaction of P7-2 with OSK1, OSK5 and OSK20. It was also shown that P7-2, together with OSK1 and O. sativa Cullin-1, was able to form the SCF complex. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that P7-2 interacted with gibberellin insensitive dwarf2 (GID2) from rice and maize plants, which is essential for regulating the GA signaling pathway. It was further demonstrated that the N-terminal region of P7-2 was necessary for the interaction with GID2. Overall, these results indicated that P7-2 functioned as a component of the SCF complex in rice, and interaction of P7-2 with GID2 implied possible roles of the GA signaling pathway during RBSDV infection.
28167952	Interactions between Nitrogen and Silicon in Rice and Their Effects on Resistance toward the Brown Planthopper <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) are two important nutritional elements required for plant growth, and both impact host plant resistance toward insect herbivores. The interaction between the two elements may therefore play a significant role in determining host plant resistance. We investigated this interaction in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its effect on resistance to the herbivore brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (BPH). Our results indicate that high-level (5.76 mM) N fertilization reduced Si accumulation in rice leaves, and furthermore, this decrease was likely due to decreased expression of Si transporters OsLsi1 and OsLsi2. Conversely, reduced N accumulation was observed at high N fertilization levels when Si was exogenously provided, and this was associated with down-regulation of OsAMT1;1 and OsGS1;1, which are involved in ammonium uptake and assimilation, respectively. Under lower N fertilization levels (0.72 and/or 1.44 mM), Si amendment resulted in increased OsNRT1:1, OsGS2, OsFd-GOGAT, OsNADH-GOGAT2, and OsGDH2 expression. Additionally, bioassays revealed that high N fertilization level significantly decreased rice resistance to BPH, and the opposite effect was observed when Si was provided. These results provide additional insight into the antagonistic interaction between Si and N accumulation in rice, and the effects on plant growth and susceptibility to herbivores.
28138057	Biochemical and Chemical Biology Study of Rice OsTAR1 Revealed that Tryptophan Aminotransferase is Involved in Auxin Biosynthesis: Identification of a Potent OsTAR1 Inhibitor, Pyruvamine2031.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	IAA, a major form of auxin, is biosynthesized from l-tryptophan via the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway in Arabidopsis. Tryptophan aminotransferases (TAA1/TARs) catalyze the first step from l-tryptophan to IPyA. In rice, the importance of TAA/TARs or YUC homologs in auxin biosynthesis has been suggested, but the enzymatic activities and involvement of the intermediate IPyA in auxin biosynthesis remain elusive. In this study, we obtained biochemical evidence that the rice tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 converts l-tryptophan to IPyA, and has a Km of 82.02 µM and a Vmax of 10.92 µM min-1 m-1, comparable with those in Arabidopsis. Next, we screened for an effective inhibitor of OsTAR1 from our previously reported inhibitor library for TAA1/TARs, designated pyruvamine (PVM). Differing from previous observations in Arabidopsis, hydroxy-type PVMs, e.g. PVM2031 (previous name KOK2031), had stronger inhibitory effects in rice than the methoxy-type. PVM2031 inhibited recombinant OsTAR1 in vitro. The Ki of PVM2031 was 276 nM. PVM2031 treatment of rice seedlings resulted in morphological changes in vivo, such as reduced lateral root density. Exogenous IAA rescued this growth inhibition, suggesting that the inhibitory effect is auxin specific. Furthermore, rice roots showed reduced IAA levels concomitant with reduced levels of IPyA in the presence of the inhibitors, suggesting that the IPyA pathway is an auxin biosynthesis pathway in rice. Since PVM2031 showed stronger inhibitory effects on rice auxin biosynthesis than known tryptophan aminotransferase inhibitors, we propose that the hydroxy-type PVM2031 is an effective tool for biochemical analysis of the function of auxin biosynthesis in rice roots.
28139322	The local impact of a coal-fired power plant on inorganic mercury and methyl-mercury distribution in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Environ Pollut	Emission from coal-fired power plants is one of the major anthropogenic sources of mercury (Hg) in the environment, because emitted Hg can be quickly deposited nearby the source, attention is paid to the effects of coal-burning facilities on levels of toxic methyl-mercury (MeHg) in biota near such sources. Since rice is an agricultural crop that can bio-accumulate MeHg, the potential effects of a large Hg-emitting coal-fired power plant in Hunan Province, China on both inorganic Hg (Hg(II)) and MeHg distributions in rice was investigated. Relatively high MeHg (up to 3.8 μg kg-1) and Hg(II) (up to 22 μg kg-1) concentrations were observed in rice samples collected adjacent to the plant, suggesting a potential impact of Hg emission from the coal fired power plant on the accumulation of Hg in rice in the area. Concentrations of MeHg in rice were positively correlated with soil MeHg, soil S, and gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) in ambient air. Soil MeHg was the most important factor controlling MeHg concentrations in rice. The methylation of Hg in soils may be controlled by factors such as the chemical speciation of inorganic Hg, soil S, and ambient GEM.
28105032	Gene Targeting Without DSB Induction Is Inefficient in Barley.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Double strand-break (DSB) induction allowed efficient gene targeting in barley (Hordeum vulgare), but little is known about efficiencies in its absence. To obtain such data, an assay system based on the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene was established, a target gene which had been used previously in rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of recombinases RAD51 and RAD54 had been shown to improve gene targeting in A. thaliana and positive-negative (P-N) selection allows the routine production of targeted mutants without DSB induction in rice. We implemented these approaches in barley and analysed gene targeting with the ALS gene in wild type and RAD51 and RAD54 transgenic lines. In addition, P-N selection was tested. In contrast to the high gene targeting efficiencies obtained in the absence of DSB induction in A. thaliana or rice, not one single gene targeting event was obtained in barley. These data suggest that gene targeting efficiencies are very low in barley and can substantially differ between different plants, even at the same target locus. They also suggest that the amount of labour and time would become unreasonably high to use these methods as a tool in routine applications. This is particularly true since DSB induction offers efficient alternatives. Barley, unlike rice and A. thaliana has a large, complex genome, suggesting that genome size or complexity could be the reason for the low efficiencies. We discuss to what extent transformation methods, genome size or genome complexity could contribute to the striking differences in the gene targeting efficiencies between barley, rice and A. thaliana.
28044270	Activation of a calcium-dependent protein kinase involved in the Azospirillum growth promotion in rice.	2017	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Rice seedlings (Oryza sativa) inoculated with the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Azospirillum brasilense FT326 showed an enhanced development of the root system 3 days after inoculation. Later on, a remarkable enlargement of shoots was also evident. An increase in the Ca2+-dependent histone kinase activity was also detected as a result of inoculation. The biochemical characterization and Western-blot analysis of the kinase strongly supports the hypothesis that it belongs to a member of the rice CDPK family. The fact that the amount of the protein did not change upon inoculation seems to indicate that a posttranslational activation is responsible for the change in the enzymatic activity. An in-gel kinase experiment identified a 46 kDa CDPK like protein kinase as a putative component of the signal transduction pathway triggered by Azospirillum inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the possible involvement of a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase in promotion of rice plants growth by A. brasilense.
28105039	Proteomic Analysis Reveals Proteins Involved in Seed Imbibition under Salt Stress in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Enhancement of salinity tolerance during seed germination is very important for direct seeding in rice. In this study, the salt-tolerant japonica landrace Jiucaiqing was used to determine the regulators that are involved in seed imbibition under salt stress. Briefly, the comparative proteomic analysis was conducted between dry (0 h) and imbibed (24 h) seeds with 150 mM NaCl. Under salt stress, the uptake of water increased rapidly before 24 h imbibition (Phase I), followed by a plateau of seed imbibition from 24 to 96 h imbibition (Phase II). We identified 14 proteins involved in seed imbibition, in which the majority of these proteins were involved in energy supply and storage protein. The early imbibition process was mediated by protein catabolism; the most of proteins were down-regulated after 24 h imbibition. Eleven genes in salt stress treated seeds were expressed early during the seed imbibition in comparison to control seeds. By comparison, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (BPM), glutelin (GLU2.2 and GLU2.3), glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunit (GAS8), and cupin domain containing protein (CDP3.1 and CDP3.2) were near the regions of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy, seed reserve utilization, and seed germination in Jiucaiqing. In particular, CDP3.1 was co-located in the region of qIR-3 for imbibition rate, and qGP-3 for germination percentage. The role of CDP3.1 was verified in enhancing seed germination under salt stress using T-DNA mutant. The identified proteins might be applicable for the improvement of seed germination under salt stress in rice.
28443109	Novel Alleles of Phosphorus-Starvation Tolerance 1 Gene (<i>PSTOL1</i>) from <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> Confers High Phosphorus Uptake Efficiency.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Limited phosphorus availability in the soil is one of the major constraints to the growth and productivity of rice across Asian, African and South American countries, where 50% of the rice is grown under rain-fed systems on poor and problematic soils. With an aim to determine novel alleles for enhanced phosphorus uptake efficiency in wild species germplasm of rice Oryza rufipogon, we investigated phosphorus uptake1 (Pup1) locus with 11 previously reported SSR markers and sequence characterized the phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1) gene. In the present study, we screened 182 accessions of O. rufipogon along with Vandana as a positive control with SSR markers. From the analysis, it was inferred that all of the O. rufipogon accessions undertaken in this study had an insertion of 90 kb region, including Pup1-K46, a diagnostic marker for PSTOL1, however, it was absent among O. sativa cv. PR114, PR121, and PR122. The complete PSTOL1 gene was also sequenced in 67 representative accessions of O. rufipogon and Vandana as a positive control. From comparative sequence analysis, 53 mutations (52 SNPs and 1 nonsense mutation) were found in the PSTOL1 coding region, of which 28 were missense mutations and 10 corresponded to changes in the amino acid polarity. These 53 mutations correspond to 17 haplotypes, of these 6 were shared and 11 were scored only once. A major shared haplotype was observed among 44 accessions of O. rufipogon along with Vandana and Kasalath. Out of 17 haplotypes, accessions representing 8 haplotypes were grown under the phosphorus-deficient conditions in hydroponics for 60 days. Significant differences were observed in the root length and weight among all the genotypes when grown under phosphorus deficiency conditions as compared to the phosphorus sufficient conditions. The O. rufipogon accession IRGC 106506 from Laos performed significantly better, with 2.5 times higher root weight and phosphorus content as compared to the positive control Vandana. In terms of phosphorus uptake efficiency, the O. rufipogon accessions IRGC 104639, 104712, and 105569 also showed nearly two times higher phosphorus content than Vandana. Thus, these O. rufipogon accessions could be used as the potential donor for improving phosphorus uptake efficiency of elite rice cultivars.

28078486	Two NADPH: Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase (POR) Isoforms Play Distinct Roles in Environmental Adaptation in Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: NADPH: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, which is ultimately converted to chlorophyll in developing leaves. Rice has two POR isoforms, OsPORA and OsPORB. OsPORA is expressed in the dark during early leaf development; OsPORB is expressed throughout leaf development regardless of light conditions. The faded green leaf (fgl) is a loss-of-function osporB mutant that displays necrotic lesions and variegation in the leaves due to destabilized grana thylakoids, and has increased numbers of plastoglobules in the chloroplasts. To investigate whether the function of OsPORA can complement that of OsPORB, we constitutively overexpressed OsPORA in fgl mutant.

RESULTS: In the 35S:OsPORA/fgl (termed OPAO) transgenic plants, the necrotic lesions of the mutant disappeared and the levels of photosynthetic pigments and proteins, as well as plastid structure, were recovered in developing leaves under natural long days in the paddy field and under short days in an artificially controlled growth room. Under constant light conditions, however, total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels in the developing leaves of OPAO plants were lower than those of wild type. Moreover, the OPAO plants exhibited mild defects in mature leaves beginning at the early reproductive stage in the paddy field.

CONCLUSIONS: The physiological function of OsPORB in response to constant light or during reproductive growth cannot be completely replaced by constitutive activity of OsPORA, although the biochemical functions of OsPORA and OsPORB are redundant. Therefore, we suggest that the two OsPORs have differentiated over the course of evolution, playing distinct roles in the adaptation of rice to the environment.
28421086	Association Analysis of Markers Derived from Starch Biosynthesis Related Genes with Starch Physicochemical Properties in the USDA Rice Mini-Core Collection.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice eating and cooking quality is largely determined by starch physicochemical properties. The diverse accessions in the USDA rice mini-core collection (URMC) facilitate extensive association analysis of starch physicochemical properties with molecular markers specific to starch biosynthesis related genes. To identify significant trait-marker associations that can be utilized in rice breeding programs for improved starch quality, we conducted two association analyses between 26 molecular markers derived from starch biosynthesis related genes and 18 parameters measured of starch physicochemical properties in two sets of the mini-core accessions successfully grown in two environments in China. Many significant trait-marker associations (P < 0.001) were detected in both association analyses. Five markers of Waxy gene, including the (CT)n repeats, the G/T SNP of intron 1, the 23 bp sequence duplication (InDel) of exon 2, the A/C SNP of exon 6, and the C/T SNP of exon 10, were found to be primarily associated with starch traits related to apparent amylose content (AAC), and two markers targeting the 4,329-4,330 bp GC/TT SNPs and 4,198 bp G/A SNP of SSIIa gene were mainly associated with traits related to gelatinization temperature (GT). Two new haplotypes were found in the mini-core collection based on the combinations of the 23 bp InDel and three SNPs (G/T of intron 1, A/C of exon 6, and C/T of exon 10) of Waxy gene. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the (CT)n polymorphisms of Waxy gene had a non-negligible effect on AAC related traits, as evidenced by significant variation in AAC related traits among rice accessions with the same Waxy SNPs but different (CT) n repeats. As the five Waxy markers and the two SSIIa markers showed consistent major effects on starch quality traits across studies, these markers should have priority for utilization in marker-assisted breeding.
28261224	Aluminum Enhances Growth and Sugar Concentration, Alters Macronutrient Status and Regulates the Expression of <i>NAC</i> Transcription Factors in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Aluminum (Al) is a beneficial element for some plant species, especially when used at low concentrations. Though some transcription factors are induced by exposure to this element, no data indicate that Al regulates the expression of NAC genes in rice. In this study we tested the effect of applying 200 μM Al on growth, chlorophyll, amino acids, sugars, macronutrient concentration and regulation of NAC transcription factors gene expression in 24-day-old plants of four rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) cultivars: Cotaxtla, Tres Ríos, Huimanguillo and Temporalero, grown hydroponically under greenhouse conditions. Twenty days after treatment, we observed that Al enhanced growth in the four cultivars studied. On average, plants grown in the presence of Al produced 140% more root dry biomass and were 30% taller than control plants. Cotaxtla and Temporalero showed double the root length, while Huimanguillo and Cotaxtla had three times more root fresh biomass and 2.5 times more root dry biomass. Huimanguillo plants showed 1.5 times more shoot height, while Cotaxtla had almost double the root dry biomass. With the exception of Tres Ríos, the rest of the cultivars had almost double the chlorophyll concentration when treated with Al, whereas amino acid and proline concentrations were not affected by Al. Sugar concentration was also increased in plants treated with Al, almost 11-fold in comparison to the control. Furthermore, we observed a synergic response of Al application on P and K concentration in roots, and on Mg concentration in shoots. Twenty-four hours after Al treatment, NAC transcription factors gene expression was measured in roots by quantitative RT-PCR. Of the 57 NAC transcription factors genes primer-pairs tested, we could distinguish that 44% (25 genes) showed different expression patterns among rice cultivars, with most of the genes induced in Cotaxtla and Temporalero plants. Of the 25 transcription factors up-regulated, those showing differential expression mostly belonged to the NAM subfamily (56%). We conclude that Al improves growth, increases sugar concentration, P and K concentrations in roots, and Mg concentration in shoots, and report, for the first time, that Al differentially regulates the expression of NAC transcription factors in rice.
28450871	Rubisco and Rubisco Activase Play an Important Role in the Biochemical Limitations of Photosynthesis in Rice, Wheat, and Maize under High Temperature and Water Deficit.	2017	Front Plant Sci	To understand the effect of heat and drought on three major cereal crops, the physiological and biochemical (i.e., metabolic) factors affecting photosynthesis were examined in rice, wheat, and maize plants grown under long-term water deficit (WD), high temperature (HT) and the combination of both stresses (HT-WD). Diffusional limitations to photosynthesis prevailed under WD for the C3 species, rice and wheat. Conversely, biochemical limitations prevailed under WD for the C4 species, maize, under HT for all three species, and under HT-WD in rice and maize. These biochemical limitations to photosynthesis were associated with Rubisco activity that was highly impaired at HT and under HT-WD in the three species. Decreases in Rubisco activation were unrelated to the amount of Rubisco and Rubisco activase (Rca), but were probably caused by inhibition of Rca activity, as suggested by the mutual decrease and positive correlation between Rubisco activation state and the rate of electron transport. Decreased Rubisco activation at HT was associated with biochemical limitation of net CO2 assimilation rate (AN). Overall, the results highlight the importance of Rubisco as a target for improving the photosynthetic performance of these C3 (wheat and rice) and C4 (maize) cereal crops under increasingly variable and warmer climates.
27592006	Prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia and risk factors in 1010 adolescent girls from rural Maharashtra, India: a cross-sectional survey.	2017	Public Health	OBJECTIVE: Iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional disorder observed in adolescent girls in India. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with IDA in rural Maharashtra, India, to address current evidence gaps.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.

METHODS: The study recruited 13- to 17-year-old adolescent girls living in 34 villages of Osmanabad district. Data were collected on individual health, dietary, sociodemographic factors, and anthropometric measurements were taken. Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were measured using Sahli's haemometer. Logistic and linear regressions were used to identify risk factors associated with IDA and Hb levels, respectively.

RESULTS: Among 1010 adolescent girls (response rate 97.5%), the mean Hb was 10.1 g/dl (standard deviation = 1.3), and 87% had anaemia (Hb < 12 g/dl). The prevalence of mild (11.0-11.9 g/dl), moderate (8.0-10.9 g/dl) and severe (Hb ≤ 7.9 g/dl) anaemia was 17%, 65% and 5%, respectively. Anaemia likelihood increased significantly with age (odds ratio (OR): 1.41 per year, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.70). Factors associated with decreased anaemia risk were mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) ≥22 cm (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.82), ≥3 days/week consumption of fruit (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.23-0.54) or rice (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.91), and incomplete schooling (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.24-0.91). In the final model lower age, MUAC and fruit consumption were significantly associated with Hb level.

CONCLUSION: Anaemia prevalence was extremely high among adolescent girls in rural areas of Maharashtra. Whilst we identified risk factors that could be used for targeting interventions, there is urgent need of comprehensive preventative interventions for the whole adolescent girl population.
28107441	Fine Mapping and Candidate Gene Analysis of the Tiller Suppression Gene ts1 in Rice.	2017	PLoS One	Tiller number is one of the key factors that influences rice plant type and yield components. In this study, an EMS-induced rice tiller suppression mutant ts1 was characterized. Morphological and histological observations revealed that, in the ts1 plants, the tiller buds were abnormally formed and therefore cannot outgrow into tillers. With an F2 population derived from a cross between ts1 and an indica cultivar Wushansimiao, a major gene, tiller suppression 1 (ts1) was fine-mapped to a 108.5 kb genomic region between markers ID8378 and SSR6884 on the short arm of rice chromosome 2. Candidate gene analysis identified nineteen putative genes. Among them, ORF4 (LOC_Os02g01610) is a PPR gene which harbored a point mutation c.+733/C→T in ts1 mutant plants. A co-dominant SNP marker cd-733C/T was subsequently developed and the SNP assay demonstrated that the point mutation co-segregated with tiller suppression phenotype. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of ORF4 in ts1 plants was significantly lower than that in their wild plants, and the expression of rice tillering regulators MOC1 and HTD1 was also significantly decreased in ts1 plants. Our data indicated that ORF4 was a strong candidate gene for ts1 and ts1 might play a role in regulating rice tillering through MOC1 and HTD1 associated pathway. The results above provide a basis for further functional characterization of ts1 and will shed light on molecular mechanism of rice tillering. The informative SNP marker cd-733C/T will facilitate marker-assisted selection of ts1 in rice plant type breeding.
28261226	Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals New Insights into High-Temperature-Dependent Glume-Unclosing in an Elite Rice Male Sterile Line.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Glume-unclosing after anthesis is a widespread phenomenon in hybrid rice and also a maternal hereditary trait. The character of Glume-unclosing in rice male sterile lines also seriously influences germination rate and the commercial quality of hybrid rice seeds. We validated that the type of glume-unclosing after anthesis in the elite rice thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line RGD-7S was caused by high temperature. Transcriptomic sequencing of rice panicles was performed to explore the change of transcript profiles under four conditions: pre- and post-anthesis under high temperature (HRGD0 and HRGD1), and pre- and post-anthesis under low temperature (LRGD0 and LRGD1). We identified a total of 14,540 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including some heat shock factors (HSFs) across the four samples. We found that more genes were up-regulated than down-regulated in the sample pair HRGD1vsHRGD0. These up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in the three biological processes of carbohydrate metabolism, response to water and cell wall macromolecular metabolism. Simultaneously, we also found that the HSF gene OsHsfB1 was specially up-regulated in HRGD1vsHRGD0. However, the down-regulated DEGs in LRGD1vsLRGD0 were remarkably clustered in the biological process of carbohydrate metabolism. This suggests that carbohydrate metabolism may play a key role in regulation of glume-unclosing under high temperature in RGD-7S. We also analyzed the expression pattern of genes enriched in carbohydrate metabolism and several HSF genes under different conditions and provide new insights into the cause of rice glume-unclosing.
28110091	Genome-wide Association Analyses Reveal the Genetic Basis of Stigma Exsertion in Rice.	2017	Mol Plant	Stigma exsertion, a key determinant of the rice mating system, greatly contributes to the application of heterosis in rice. Although a few quantitative trait loci associated with stigma exsertion have been fine mapped or cloned, the underlying genetic architecture remains unclear. We performed a genome-wide association study on stigma exsertion and related floral traits using 6.5 million SNPs characterized in 533 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa. We identified 23 genomic loci that are significantly associated with stigma exsertion and related traits, three of which are co-localized with three major grain size genes GS3, GW5, and GW2. Further analyses indicated that these three genes affected the stigma exsertion by controlling the size and shape of the spikelet and stigma. Combinations of GS3 and GW5 largely defined the levels of stigma exsertion and related traits. Selections of these two genes resulted in specific distributions of floral traits among subpopulations of O. sativa. The low stigma exsertion combination gw5GS3 existed in half of the cultivated rice varieties; therefore, introducing the GW5gs3 combination into male sterile lines is of high potential for improving the seed production of hybrid rice.
28265566	Whole-Genome Characteristics and Polymorphic Analysis of Vietnamese Rice Landraces as a Comprehensive Information Resource for Marker-Assisted Selection.	2017	Int J Genomics	Next generation sequencing technologies have provided numerous opportunities for application in the study of whole plant genomes. In this study, we present the sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of five typical rice landraces including three indica and two japonica with potential blast resistance. A total of 688.4 million 100 bp paired-end reads have yielded approximately 30-fold coverage to compare with the Nipponbare reference genome. Among them, a small number of reads were mapped to both chromosomes and organellar genomes. Over two million and eight hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (InDels) in indica and japonica lines have been determined, which potentially have significant impacts on multiple transcripts of genes. SNP deserts, contiguous SNP-low regions, were found on chromosomes 1, 4, and 5 of all genomes of rice examined. Based on the distribution of SNPs per 100 kilobase pairs, the phylogenetic relationships among the landraces have been constructed. This is the first step towards revealing several salient features of rice genomes in Vietnam and providing significant information resources to further marker-assisted selection (MAS) in rice breeding programs.
28072536	Role of Ionic Strength and pH in Modulating Thermodynamic Profiles Associated with CO Escape from Rice Nonsymbiotic Hemoglobin 1.	2017	J Phys Chem B	Type 1 nonsymbiotic hemoglobins are found in a wide variety of land plants and exhibit very high affinities for exogenous gaseous ligands. These proteins are presumed to have a role in protecting plant cells from oxidative stress under etiolated/hypoxic conditions through NO dioxygenase activity. In this study we have employed photoacoustic calorimetry, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and classical molecular dynamics simulations in order to elucidate thermodynamics, kinetics, and ligand migration pathways upon CO photodissociation from WT and a H73L mutant of type 1 nonsymbiotic hemoglobin from Oryza sativa (rice). We observe a temperature dependence of the resolved thermodynamic parameters for CO photodissociation from CO-rHb1 which we attribute to temperature dependent formation of a network of electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of the heme propionate groups. We also observe slower ligand escape from the protein matrix under mildly acidic conditions in both the WT and H73L mutant (τ = 134 ± 19 and 90 ± 15 ns). Visualization of transient hydrophobic channels within our classical molecular dynamics trajectories allows us to attribute this phenomenon to a change in the ligand migration pathway which occurs upon protonation of the distal His73, His117, and His152. Protonation of these residues may be relevant to the functioning of the protein in vivo given that etiolation/hypoxia can cause a decrease in intracellular pH in plant cells.
28293245	Lead (Pb) Toxicity; Physio-Biochemical Mechanisms, Grain Yield, Quality, and Pb Distribution Proportions in Scented Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Lead (Pb) caused interruptions with normal plant metabolism, crop yield losses and quality issues are of great concern. This study assessed the physio-biochemical responses, yield and grain quality traits and Pb distribution proportions in three different fragrant rice cultivars i.e., Meixiangzhan-2, Xinagyaxiangzhan and Basmati-385. Plants were exposed to 400, 800, and 1,200 ppm of Pb while pots without Pb were taken as control (0 ppm). Our results showed that Pb toxicity significantly (P < 0.05) reduced photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll contents and carotenoids) and inducted oxidative stress with increased production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malanodialdehyde (MDA) and leaves leachates; while such effects were more apparent in Xinagyaxiangzhan than other two rice cultivars. Pb stress differentially affected the production protein, proline and soluble sugars; however the production rates were higher at heading stage (HS) than maturity stage (MS). Furthermore, Pb stress altered superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidases (POD), catalases (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidases (APX) activities and glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) production in all rice cultivars at both HS and MS. All Pb levels reduced the yield and yield components of all rice cultivars; nonetheless such reductions were observed highest in Xinagyaxiangzhan (69.12%) than Meixiangzhan-2 (58.05%) and Basmati-385 (46.27%) and resulted in grain quality deterioration. Significant and positive correlations among rice yields with productive tillers/pot and grains per panicle while negative with sterility percentage were also observed. In addition, all rice cultivars readily taken up the Pb contents from soil to roots and transported upward in different proportions with maximum in roots followed by stemss, leaves, ears and grains. Higher proportions of Pb contents in above ground plant parts in Xinagyaxiangzhan possibly lead to maximum losses in this cultivar than other two cultivars; while less damage in Basmati-385 might be related to strong anti-oxidative defense system and lower proportions of Pb contents in its aerial parts.
28282452	SP-LL-37, human antimicrobial peptide, enhances disease resistance in transgenic rice.	2017	PLoS One	Human LL-37 is a multifunctional antimicrobial peptide of cathelicidin family. It has been shown in recent studies that it can serve as a host's defense against influenza A virus. We now demonstrate in this study how signal peptide LL-37 (SP-LL-37) can be used in rice resistance against bacterial leaf blight and blast. We synthesized LL-37 peptide and subcloned in a recombinant pPZP vector with pGD1 as promoter. SP-LL-37 was introduced into rice plants by Agrobacterium mediated transformation. Stable expression of SP-LL-37 in transgenic rice plants was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA analyses. Subcellular localization of SP-LL-37-GFP fusion protein showed evidently in intercellular space. Our data on testing for resistance to bacterial leaf blight and blast revealed that the transgenic lines are highly resistant compared to its wildtype. Our results suggest that LL-37 can be further explored to improve wide-spectrum resistance to biotic stress in rice.
28074873	The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Plants can perceive environmental changes and respond to external stressors. Here, we show that OsNAC2, a member of the NAC transcription factor family, was strongly induced by ABA and osmotic stressors such as drought and high salt. With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions. RNAi plants showed enhanced tolerance to high salinity and drought stress at both the vegetative and flowering stages. Furthermore, RNAi plants had improved yields after drought stress. A microarray assay indicated that many ABA-dependent stress-related genes were down-regulated in OsNAC2 overexpression lines. We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively. Our results suggest that in rice OsNAC2 regulates both abiotic stress responses and ABA-mediated responses, and acts at the junction between the ABA and abiotic stress pathways.
28142093	Ascorbic acid deficiency leads to increased grain chalkiness in transgenic rice for suppressed of L-GalLDH.	2017	J Plant Physiol	The grain chalkiness of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which determines the rice quality and price, is a major concern in rice breeding. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a critical role in regulating rice endosperm chalkiness. Ascorbic acid (Asc) is a major plant antioxidant, which strictly regulates the levels of ROS. l-galactono-1, 4-lactone dehydrogenase (L-GalLDH, EC 1.3.2.3) is an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of Asc biosynthesis in higher plants. Here we show that the L-GalLDH-suppressed transgenic rice, GI-1 and GI-2, which have constitutively low (between 30% and 50%) leaf and grain Asc content compared with the wild-type (WT), exhibit significantly increased grain chalkiness. Further examination showed that the deficiency of Asc resulted in a higher lipid peroxidation and H2O2 content, accompanied by a lower hydroxyl radical scavenging rate, total antioxidant capacity and photosynthetic ability. In addition, changes of the enzyme activities and gene transcript abundances related to starch synthesis were also observed in GI-1 and GI-2 grains. The results we presented here suggest a close correlation between Asc deficiency and grain chalkiness in the L-GalLDH-suppressed transgenics. Asc deficiency leads to the accumulation of H2O2, affecting antioxidant capacity and photosynthetic function, changing enzyme activities and gene transcript abundances related to starch synthesis, finally leading to the increased grain chalkiness.
28097084	The calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and CDPK-related kinase gene families in <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>-comparison with five other plant species in structure, evolution, and expression.	2017	FEBS Open Bio	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs or CPKs) play important roles in various physiological processes of plants, including growth and development, stress responses and hormone signaling. Although the CDPK gene family has been characterized in several model plants, little is known about this gene family in Hevea brasiliensis (the Para rubber tree). Here, we characterize the entire H. brasiliensis CDPK and CDPK-related kinase (CRK) gene families comprising 30 CDPK genes (HbCPK1 to 30) and nine CRK genes (HbCRK1 to 9). Structure and phylogeny analyses of these CDPK and CRK genes demonstrate evolutionary conservation in these gene families across H. brasiliensis and other plant species. The expression of HbCPK and HbCRK genes was investigated via Solexa sequencing in a range of experimental conditions (different tissues, phases of leaf development, ethylene treatment, and various abiotic stresses). The results suggest that HbCPK and HbCRK genes are important components in growth, development, and stress responses of H. brasiliensis. Parallel studies on the CDPK and CRK gene families were also extended to five other plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, Manihot esculenta, and Ricinus communis). The CDPK and CRK genes from different plant species that exhibit similar expression patterns tend to cluster together, suggesting a coevolution of gene structure and expression behavior in higher plants. The results serve as a foundation to further functional studies of these gene families in H. brasiliensis as well as in the whole plant kingdom.
28184228	Marker Aided Incorporation of <i>Saltol</i>, a Major QTL Associated with Seedling Stage Salt Tolerance, into <i>Oryza sativa</i> 'Pusa Basmati 1121'.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Pusa Basmati 1121 (PB1121), an elite Basmati rice cultivar is vulnerable to salinity at seedling stage. A study was undertaken to impart seedling-stage salt tolerance into PB1121 by transferring a quantitative trait locus (QTL), Saltol, using FL478 as donor, through marker assisted backcrossing. Sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) marker RM 3412, tightly linked to Saltol was used for foreground selection. Background recovery was estimated using 90 genome-wide STMS markers. Systematic phenotypic selection helped in accelerated recovery of recurrent parent phenome (RPP). A set of 51 BC3F2 lines homozygous for Saltol were advanced to develop four improved near isogenic lines (NILs) of PB1121 with seedling stage salt tolerance. The background genome recovery in the NILs ranged from 93.3 to 99.4%. The improved NILs were either similar or better than the recurrent parent PB1121 for yield, grain and cooking quality and duration. Biochemical analyses revealed significant variation in shoot and root Na+ and K+ concentrations. Correlation between shoot and root Na+ concentration was stronger than that between root and shoot K+ concentration. The effect of QTL integration into the NILs was studied through expression profiling of OsHKT1;5, one of the genes present in the Saltol region. The NILs had significantly higher OsHKT1;5 expression than the recurrent parent PB1121, but lower than FL478 on salt exposure validating the successful introgression of Saltol in the NILs. This was also confirmed under agronomic evaluation, wherein the NILs showed greater salt tolerance at seedling stage. One of the NILs, Pusa1734-8-3-3 (NIL3) showed comparable yield and cooking quality to the recurrent parent PB1121, with high field level seedling stage salinity tolerance and shorter duration. This is the first report of successful introgression of Saltol into a Basmati rice cultivar.
28179912	A Simple, Rapid Method for Determination of Melatonin in Plant Tissues by UPLC Coupled with High Resolution Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Melatonin (MLT) was involved in regulating various stages of plant growth and development. However, due to the low concentration and complex matrixes of plant, the analysis of MLT is a challenging task. In this study, we developed a rapid and efficient method with simplified sample preparation by employing UPLC coupled with a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry, and stable isotope-labeled MLT (MLT-d4) was first used as internal standard in the developed analytical method. In the developed method, we used one-step liquid-liquid extraction to purify the crude extracts both from shoot and root of rice for the analysis, which remarkably simplify the sample preparation process. The method exhibits high specificity and recovery yield (>96.4%). Good linearities were obtained for MLT ranging from 0.01 to 20 ng/ mL with determination coefficient (R2) of 0.9991. The limit of detection for MLT was 0.03 pg. Reproducibility of the method was evaluated by intra-day and inter-day measurements and the results showed that relative standard deviations were less than 7.2%. Moreover, MLT quantification was accomplished by using only 100 mg fresh plant tissues. Additionally, the established method was successfully applied to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions of MLT in rice under cadmium (Cd) stress condition. We found that the content of MLT in shoot and root of rice increased under Cd stress, suggesting that MLT would play a crucial role in modulating the responses to Cd stress in different plant tissues.
28199904	Cyclic electron flow may provide some protection against PSII photoinhibition in rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves under heat stress.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Previously we have shown that a quick down-regulation in PSI activity compares to that of PSII following short-term heat stress for two rice groups including C4023 and Q4149, studied herein. These accessions were identified to have different natural capacities in driving cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI; i.e., low CEF (lcef) and high CEF (hcef) for C4023 and Q4149, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these two lines have different mechanisms of protecting photosystem II from photodamage under heat stress. We observed a stepwise alteration in the shape of Chl a fluorescence induction (OJIP) with increasing temperature treatment. The effect of 44°C treatment on the damping in Chl a fluorescence was more pronounced in C4023 than in Q4149. Likewise, we noted a disruption in the I-step, a decline in the Fv due to a strong damping in the Fm, and a slight increase in the F0. Normalized data demonstrated that the I-step seems more susceptible to 44°C in C4023 than in Q4149. We also measured the redox states of plastocyanin (PC) and P700 by monitoring the transmission changes at 820nm (I820), and observed a disturbance in the oxidation/reduction kinetics of PC and P700. The decline in the amplitude of their oxidation was shown to be about 29% and 13% for C4023 and Q4149, respectively. The electropotential component (Δφ) of ms-DLE appeared more sensitive to temperature stress than the chemical component (ΔpH), and the impact of heat was more evident and drastic in C4023 than in Q4149. Under heat stress, we noticed a concomitant decline in the primary photochemistry of PSII as well as in both the membrane energization process and the lumen protonation for both accessions, and it is evident that heat affects these parameters more in C4023 than in Q4149. All these data suggest that higher CET can confer higher photoprotection to PSII in rice lines, which can be a desirable trait during rice breeding, especially in the context of a "warming" world.
28079051	Integrated crop management practices for maximizing grain yield of double-season rice crop.	2017	Sci Rep	Information on maximum grain yield and its attributes are limited for double-season rice crop grown under the subtropical environment. This study was conducted to examine key characteristics associated with high yielding double-season rice crop through a comparison between an integrated crop management (ICM) and farmers' practice (FP). Field experiments were conducted in the early and late seasons in the subtropical environment of Wuxue County, Hubei Province, China in 2013 and 2014. On average, grain yield in ICM was 13.5% higher than that in FP. A maximum grain yield of 9.40 and 10.53 t ha-1 was achieved under ICM in the early- and late-season rice, respectively. Yield improvement of double-season rice with ICM was achieved with the combined effects of increased plant density and optimized nutrient management. Yield gain of ICM resulted from a combination of increases in sink size due to more panicle number per unit area and biomass production, further supported by the increased leaf area index, leaf area duration, radiation use efficiency, crop growth rate, and total nitrogen uptake compared with FP. Further enhancement in the yield potential of double-season rice should focus on increasing crop growth rate and biomass production through improved and integrated crop management practices.
28094773	Methane Emissions and Microbial Communities as Influenced by Dual Cropping of Azolla along with Early Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Azolla caroliniana Willd. is widely used as a green manure accompanying rice, but its ecological importance remains unclear, except for its ability to fix nitrogen in association with cyanobacteria. To investigate the impacts of Azolla cultivation on methane emissions and environmental variables in paddy fields, we performed this study on the plain of Dongting Lake, China, in 2014. The results showed that the dual cropping of Azolla significantly suppressed the methane emissions from paddies, likely due to the increase in redox potential in the root region and dissolved oxygen concentration at the soil-water interface. Furthermore, the floodwater pH decreased in association with Azolla cultivation, which is also a factor significantly correlated with the decrease in methane emissions. An increase in methanotrophic bacteria population (pmoA gene copies) and a reduction in methanogenic archaea (16S rRNA gene copies) were observed in association with Azolla growth. During rice cultivation period, dual cropping of Azolla also intensified increasing trend of 1/Simpson of methanogens and significantly decreased species richness (Chao 1) and species diversity (1/Simpson, 1/D) of methanotrophs. These results clearly demonstrate the suppression of CH4 emissions by culturing Azolla and show the environmental and microbial responses in paddy soil under Azolla cultivation.
28054942	A Comprehensive Proteomic Survey of ABA-Induced Protein Phosphorylation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Int J Mol Sci	abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone regulating plant development and stress response. The signal transduction of ABA largely relies on protein phosphorylation. However; little is known about the phosphorylation events occurring during ABA signaling in rice thus far. By employing a label-free; MS (Mass Spectrometry)-based phosphoproteomic approach; we identified 2271 phosphosites of young rice seedlings and their intensity dynamics in response to ABA; during which 1060 proteins were found to be differentially phosphorylated. Western-blot analysis verified the differential phosphorylation pattern of D1, SMG1 and SAPK9 as indicated by the MS result; suggesting the high reliability of our phosphoproteomic data. The DP (differentially phosphorylated) proteins are extensively involved in ABA as well as other hormone signaling pathways. It is suggested that ABA antagonistically regulates brassinosteroid (BR) signaling via inhibiting BR receptor activity. The result of this study not only expanded our knowledge of rice phosphoproteome, but also shed more light on the pattern of protein phosphorylation in ABA signaling.
27578095	Young Seedling Stripe1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-associated protein required for chloroplast development in rice seedlings.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: Young Seedling Stripe1 (YSS1) was characterized as an important regulator of plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP) activity essential for chloroplast development at rice seedling stage. Chloroplast development is coordinately regulated by plastid- and nuclear-encoding genes. Although a few regulators have been reported to be involved in chloroplast development, new factors remain to be identified, given the complexity of this process. Here, we report the characterization of a temperature-sensitive young seedling stripe1 (yss1) rice mutant, which develops striated leaves at the seedling stage, particularly in leaf 3, but produces wild-type leaves in leaf 5 and onwards. The chlorotic leaves have decreased chlorophyll (Chls) accumulation and impaired chloroplast structure. Positional cloning combined with sequencing demonstrated that aberrant splicing of the 8th intron in YSS1 gene, due to a single nucleotide deletion around splicing donor site, leads to decreased expression of YSS1 and accumulation of an 8th intron-retained yss1 transcript. Furthermore, complementation test revealed that downregulation of YSS1 but not accumulation of yss1 transcript confers yss1 mutant phenotype. YSS1 encodes a chloroplast nucleoid-localized protein belonging to the DUF3727 superfamily. Expression analysis showed that YSS1 gene is more expressed in newly expanded leaves, and distinctly up-regulated as temperatures increase and by light stimulus. PEP- and nuclear-encoded phage-type RNA polymerase (NEP)-dependent genes are separately down-regulated and up-regulated in yss1 mutant, indicating that PEP activity may be impaired. Furthermore, levels of chloroplast proteins are mostly reduced in yss1 seedlings. Together, our findings identify YSS1 as a novel regulator of PEP activity essential for chloroplast development at rice seedling stage.
28355306	Genome-wide association analysis identifies resistance loci for bacterial blight in a diverse collection of indica rice germplasm.	2017	PLoS One	Bacterial blight, which is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. The development and use of disease-resistant cultivars have been the most effective strategy to control bacterial blight. Identifying the genes mediating bacterial blight resistance is a prerequisite for breeding cultivars with broad-spectrum and durable resistance. We herein describe a genome-wide association study involving 172 diverse Oryza sativa ssp. indica accessions to identify loci influencing the resistance to representative strains of six Xoo races. Twelve resistance loci containing 121 significantly associated signals were identified using 317,894 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which explained 13.3-59.9% of the variability in lesion length caused by Xoo races P1, P6, and P9a. Two hotspot regions (L11 and L12) were located within or nearby two cloned R genes (xa25 and Xa26) and one fine-mapped R gene (Xa4). Our results confirmed the relatively high resolution of genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we detected novel significant associations on chromosomes 2, 3, and 6-10. Haplotype analyses of xa25, the Xa26 paralog (MRKc; LOC_Os11g47290), and a Xa4 candidate gene (LOC_11g46870) revealed differences in bacterial blight resistance among indica subgroups. These differences were responsible for the observed variations in lesion lengths resulting from infections by Xoo races P1 and P9a. Our findings may be relevant for future studies involving bacterial blight resistance gene cloning, and provide insights into the genetic basis for bacterial blight resistance in indica rice, which may be useful for knowledge-based crop improvement.
28179911	Characterization and Ectopic Expression of <i>CoWRI1</i>, an AP2/EREBP Domain-Containing Transcription Factor from Coconut (<i>Cocos nucifera</i> L.) Endosperm, Changes the Seeds Oil Content in Transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a key tropical crop and a member of the monocotyledonous family Arecaceae (Palmaceae). Few genes and related metabolic processes involved in coconut endosperm development have been investigated. In this study, a new member of the WRI1 gene family was isolated from coconut endosperm and was named CoWRI1. Its transcriptional activities and interactions with the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (BCCP2) promoter of CoWRI1 were confirmed by the yeast two-hybrid and yeast one-hybrid approaches, respectively. Functional characterization was carried out through seed-specific expression in Arabidopsis and endosperm-specific expression in rice. In transgenic Arabidopsis, high over-expressions of CoWRI1 in seven independent T2 lines were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The relative mRNA accumulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in either fatty acid biosynthesis or triacylglycerols assembly (BCCP2, KASI, MAT, ENR, FATA, and GPDH) were also assayed in mature seeds. Furthermore, lipid and fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 significantly increased. In two homozygous T2 transgenic rice lines (G5 and G2), different CoWRI1 expression levels were detected, but no CoWRI1 transcripts were detected in the wild type. Analyses of the seed oil content, starch content, and total protein content indicated that the two T2 transgenic lines showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in seed oil content. The transgenic lines also showed a significant increase in starch content, whereas total protein content decreased significantly. Further analysis of the fatty acid composition revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) and linolenic acid (C18:3) increased significantly in the seeds of the transgenic rice lines, but oleic acid (C18:1) levels significantly declined.
28280498	Understanding Host-Pathogen Interactions with Expression Profiling of NILs Carrying Rice-Blast Resistance <i>Pi9</i> Gene.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Magnaporthe oryzae infection causes rice blast, a destructive disease that is responsible for considerable decrease in rice yield. Development of resistant varieties via introgressing resistance genes with marker-assisted breeding can eliminate pesticide use and minimize crop losses. Here, resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) of Pusa Basmati-1(PB1) carrying broad spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was used to investigate Pi9-mediated resistance response. Infected and uninfected resistant NIL and susceptible control line were subjected to RNA-Seq. With the exception of one gene (Pi9), transcriptional signatures between the two lines were alike, reflecting basal similarities in their profiles. Resistant and susceptible lines possessed 1043 (727 up-regulated and 316 down-regulated) and 568 (341 up-regulated and 227 down-regulated) unique and significant differentially expressed loci (SDEL), respectively. Pathway analysis revealed higher transcriptional activation of kinases, WRKY, MYB, and ERF transcription factors, JA-ET hormones, chitinases, glycosyl hydrolases, lipid biosynthesis, pathogenesis and secondary metabolism related genes in resistant NIL than susceptible line. Singular enrichment analysis demonstrated that blast resistant NIL is significantly enriched with genes for primary and secondary metabolism, response to biotic stimulus and transcriptional regulation. The co-expression network showed proteins of genes in response to biotic stimulus interacted in a manner unique to resistant NIL upon M. oryzae infection. These data suggest that Pi9 modulates genome-wide transcriptional regulation in resistant NIL but not in susceptible PB1. We successfully used transcriptome profiling to understand the molecular basis of Pi9-mediated resistance mechanisms, identified potential candidate genes involved in early pathogen response and revealed the sophisticated transcriptional reprogramming during rice-M. oryzae interactions.
28250586	Physiological performance of two contrasting rice varieties under water stress.	2017	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Two rice varieties PR-115 and Super-7 were imposed to water stress and different physiological traits were monitored to evaluate the performance of these varieties under drought. Under water stress condition although the relative water content, osmotic potential, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate, carbon discrimination and biomass decreased in both the varieties however, the reduction was more pronounced in Super-7 variety. Oryzanol a trans-ester of ferulic acid functions as antioxidant and it increased along with total phenolic and anthocyanin content in both the varieties under drought stress. However, gallic acid, 4 hydroxy benzoic acid, syringic acid and chlorogenic acid showed differential pattern in both of the varieties under water limiting conditions. Under drought, grain yield was penalized by 17 and 54% in PR-115 and Super-7 varieties, respectively in comparison to watered plants. Super-7 variety showed pronounced electrolyte leakage and MDA enhancement under water stress condition. High non photochemical quenching and reduction in Y(NO) and Y(II) indicated balanced energy management in tolerant PR-115 variety. The studies showed that PR-115 is a drought tolerant variety while Super-7 is drought sensitive in nature.
28101087	Rice Stripe Mosaic Virus, a Novel Cytorhabdovirus Infecting Rice via Leafhopper Transmission.	2016	Front Microbiol	A new rice viral disease exhibiting distinct symptoms-yellow stripes, mosaic and twisted tips on leaves-was found in China. Electron microscopy of infected leaf cells revealed the presence of bacilliform virions and electron-translucent granular-fibrillar viroplasm in the cytoplasm. The enveloped viral particles were 300 to 375 nm long and 45 to 55 nm wide. The leafhopper Recilia dorsalis was able to transmit the virus to rice seedlings, which subsequently exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in fields. The complete genome of the virus was obtained by small-RNA deep sequencing and reverse transcription-PCR product sequencing. The anti-genome contains seven open reading frames (ORFs). The deduced amino acids of ORF1, ORF5, and ORF7 are, respectively, homologous to the nucleocapsid protein (N), glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase protein (L) of known rhabdoviruses. The predicted product of ORF2 is identified as a phosphoprotein (P) based on its multiple potential phosphorylation sites and 12.6 to 21.0% amino acid (aa) identities with the P proteins of plant rhabdoviruses. The product of ORF4 is presumed to be the viral matrix (M) protein for it shares 10.3 to 14.3% aa identities with those of other rhabdoviruses. The above five products were confirmed as the viral structural proteins by SDS-PAGE and aa sequencing analyses of purified virus preparation. ORF3 and ORF6 are considered to encode two nonstructural proteins with unknown functions. Phylogenetic analysis based on protein N, G, and L amino acid sequences indicated that the isolated virus, which we have tentatively named Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV), is a new species in the genus Cytorhabdovirus. To our knowledge, RSMV is the only cytorhabdovirus naturally infecting rice and the first reported leafhopper-transmitted cytorhabdovirus. Our surveys of rice fields indicate that RSMV occurs frequently in Guangdong Province, China. Although the disease incidence is low at present, it might become serious with the vector insect population increasing.
28126846	A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (Oryza sativa) in Asia. After landing on plants, BPH rapidly accesses plant phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice plants by BPH NlEG1 is highly expressed in the salivary glands and midgut. Silencing NlEG1 decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice plants. By contrast, NlEG1 silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in plants compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH's stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in plant cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the plant cell wall defense in rice.
28220138	<i>De novo</i> Transcriptome Assembly of <i>Phomopsis liquidambari</i> Provides Insights into Genes Associated with Different Lifestyles in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	The mechanisms that trigger the switch from endophytic fungi to saprophytic fungi are largely unexplored. Broad host range Phomopsis liquidambari is established in endophytic and saprophytic systems with rice (Oryza sativa L.). Endophytic P. liquidambari promotes rice growth, increasing rice yield and improving the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer. This species's saprophytic counterpart can decompose rice litterfall, promoting litter organic matter cycling and the release of nutrients and improving the soil microbial environment. Fluorescence microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantitative PCR investigated the colonization dynamics and biomass of P. liquidambari in rice in vivo. P. liquidambari formed infection structures similar to phytopathogens with infected vascular tissues that systematically spread to acrial parts. However, different from pathogenic infection, P. liquidambari colonization exhibits space restriction and quantity restriction. Direct comparison of a fungal transcriptome under three different habitats provided a better understanding of lifestyle conversion during plant-fungi interactions. The isolated total RNA of Ck (pure culture), EP (endophytic culture) and FP (saprophytic culture) was subjected to Illumina transcriptome sequencing. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate Phomopsis sp. using RNA-seq technology to obtain whole transcriptome information. A total of 27,401,258 raw reads were generated and 22,700 unigenes were annotated. Functional annotation indicated that carbohydrate metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites played important roles. There were 2522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the saprophytic and endophytic lifestyles. Quantitative PCR analysis validated the DEGs of RNA-seq. Analysis of DEGs between saprophytic and endophytic lifestyles revealed that most genes from amino acids metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, secondary metabolism and terpenoid and steroid biosynthesis were up-regulated in EP. Secondary metabolites of these pathways may affect fungal growth and development and contribute to signaling communication with the host. Most pathways of xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism were upregulated in FP. Cytochrome P450s play diverse vital roles in endophytism and saprophytism, as their highly specialized functions are evolutionarily adapted to various ecological niches. These results help to characterize the relationship between fungi and plants, the diversity of fungi for ecological adaptations and the application prospects for fungi in sustainable agriculture.
28144699	Fine mapping of RYMV3: a new resistance gene to Rice yellow mottle virus from Oryza glaberrima.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A new resistance gene against Rice yellow mottle virus was identified and mapped in a 15-kb interval. The best candidate is a CC-NBS-LRR gene. Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) disease is a serious constraint to the cultivation of rice in Africa and selection for resistance is considered to be the most effective management strategy. The aim of this study was to characterize the resistance of Tog5307, a highly resistant accession belonging to the African cultivated rice species (Oryza glaberrima), that has none of the previously identified resistance genes to RYMV. The specificity of Tog5307 resistance was analyzed using 18 RYMV isolates. While three of them were able to infect Tog5307 very rapidly, resistance against the others was effective despite infection events attributed to resistance-breakdown or incomplete penetrance of the resistance. Segregation of resistance in an interspecific backcross population derived from a cross between Tog5307 and the susceptible Oryza sativa variety IR64 showed that resistance is dominant and is controlled by a single gene, named RYMV3. RYMV3 was mapped in an approximately 15-kb interval in which two candidate genes, coding for a putative transmembrane protein and a CC-NBS-LRR domain-containing protein, were annotated. Sequencing revealed non-synonymous polymorphisms between Tog5307 and the O. glaberrima susceptible accession CG14 in both candidate genes. An additional resistant O. glaberrima accession, Tog5672, was found to have the Tog5307 genotype for the CC-NBS-LRR gene but not for the putative transmembrane protein gene. Analysis of the cosegregation of Tog5672 resistance with the RYMV3 locus suggests that RYMV3 is also involved in Tog5672 resistance, thereby supporting the CC-NBS-LRR gene as the best candidate for RYMV3.
28487708	Novel Chitinase Gene <i>LOC_Os11g47510</i> from Indica Rice Tetep Provides Enhanced Resistance against Sheath Blight Pathogen <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Sheath blight disease (ShB), caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, is one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.), causing substantial yield loss in rice. In the present study, a novel rice chitinase gene, LOC_Os11g47510 was cloned from QTL region of R. solani tolerant rice line Tetep and used for functional validation by genetic transformation of ShB susceptible japonica rice line Taipei 309 (TP309). The transformants were characterized using molecular and functional approaches. Molecular analysis by PCR using a set of primers specific to CaMv 35S promoter, chitinase and HptII genes confirmed the presence of transgene in transgenic plants which was further validated by Southern hybridization. Further, qRT-PCR analysis of transgenic plants showed good correlation between transgene expression and the level of sheath blight resistance among transformants. Functional complementation assays confirmed the effectiveness of the chitinase mediated resistance in all the transgenic TP309 plants with varying levels of enhanced resistance against R. solani. Therefore, the novel chitinase gene cloned and characterized in the present study from the QTL region of rice will be of significant use in molecular plant breeding program for developing sheath blight resistance in rice.
28422981	QTL analysis and dissection of panicle components in rice using advanced backcross populations derived from Oryza Sativa cultivars HR1128 and 'Nipponbare'.	2017	PLoS One	Panicle traits are among the most important agronomic characters which directly relate to yield in rice. Grain number (GN), panicle length (PL), primary branch number (PBN), and secondary branch number (SBN) are the major components of rice panicle structure, and are all controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In our research, four advanced backcross overlapping populations (BIL152, BIL196a, BIL196b, and BIL196b-156) carrying introgressed segments from chromosome 6 were derived from an indica/japonica cross that used the super-hybrid rice restorer line HR1128 and the international sequenced japonica cultivar 'Nipponbare' as the donor and recurrent parents, respectively. The four panicle traits, GN, PL, PBN, and SBN, were evaluated for QTL effects using the inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method in populations over two years at two sites. Results showed that a total of twelve QTLs for GN, PL, PBN, and SBN were detected on chromosome 6. Based on marker loci physical positions, the QTLs were found to be tightly linked to three important chromosomal intervals described as RM7213 to RM19962, RM20000 to RM20210, and RM412 to RM20595. Three QTLs identified in this study, PL6-5, PBN6-1, and PBN6-2, were found to be novel compared with previous studies. A major QTL (PL6-5) for panicle length was detected in all four populations at two locations, and its position was narrowed down to a 1.3Mb region on chromosome 6. Near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying PL6-5 will be developed for fine mapping of the QTL, and our results will provide referable information for gene excavation of panicle components in rice.
27709567	Use of CRISPR/Cas Genome Editing Technology for Targeted Mutagenesis in Rice.	2017	Methods Mol Biol	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is a newly emerging mutagenesis (gene-editing) tool in genetic engineering. Among the agriculturally important crops, several genes have been successfully mutated by the system, and some agronomic important traits have been rapidly generated, which indicates the potential applications in both scientific research and plant breeding. In this chapter, we describe a standard gene-editing procedure to effectively target rice genes and to make specific rice mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system mediated by Agrobacterium transformation.
28487722	Association Mapping Reveals Novel Genetic Loci Contributing to Flooding Tolerance during Germination in <i>Indica</i> Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the only cereal crop that possesses the ability to germinate under flooded or other oxygen-deficient conditions. Rapid elongation of the coleoptile is a perfect response to flooding during germination, with coleoptile length differing among various rice varieties. Despite multiple studies have uncovered valuable information concerning this trait by focusing on the physiological metabolism of oxygen stress, the underlying genetic mechanism still remains unknown. In the present study, we screened coleoptile lengths of 432 indica varieties germinated in two environments (normal and flooded) and found more variation existing in flooded coleoptile length (FCL) rather than in normal coleoptile length (NCL). With the phenotypic data of NCL, FCL and FTI (flooding tolerance index), a genome-wide association study was performed by using 5291 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We detected 2, 11, and 9 significant SNPs under a mixed linear mode for NCL, FCL, and FTI, respectively. Of these SNPs, five were shared by FCL and FTI. Haplotype and phenotype effect analysis on the highest ranking locus indicated one of the two haplotypes contributed to coleoptile elongation remarkably. To better understand the controlling gene of this locus, reported expression profile data was applied. We focused on LOC_Os06g03520, a candidate gene which was highly induced by anoxia (∼507 fold). Sequence analysis in 51 varieties demonstrated Hap.2 associated perfectly with flooding tolerance. Further studies on this gene may help explore the molecular mechanism of rice flooding tolerance during germination. We believe our discoveries may conduce to isolating major genes and aid the improvement of flooding tolerance in modern breeding programs.
28045983	PPero, a Computational Model for Plant PTS1 Type Peroxisomal Protein Prediction.	2017	PLoS One	Well-defined motifs often make it easy to investigate protein function and localization. In plants, peroxisomal proteins are guided to peroxisomes mainly by a conserved type 1 (PTS1) or type 2 (PTS2) targeting signal, and the PTS1 motif is commonly used for peroxisome targeting protein prediction. Currently computational prediction of peroxisome targeted PTS1-type proteins are mostly based on the 3 amino acids PTS1 motif and the adjacent sequence which is less than 14 amino acid residue in length. The potential contribution of the adjacent sequences beyond this short region has never been well investigated in plants. In this work, we develop a bi-profile Bayesian SVM method to extract and learn position-based amino acid features for both PTS1 motifs and their extended adjacent sequences in plants. Our proposed model outperformed other implementations with similar applications and achieved the highest accuracy of 93.6% and 92.6% for Arabidosis and other plant species respectively. A large scale analysis for Arabidopsis, Rice, Maize, Potato, Wheat, and Soybean proteome was conducted using the proposed model and a batch of candidate PTS1 proteins were predicted. The DNA segments corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of 9 selected candidates were cloned and transformed into Arabidopsis for experimental validation, and 5 of them demonstrated peroxisome targeting.
28250588	Fast recovery of transgenic submergence tolerant rice cultivars of North-East India by early co-cultivation of <i>Agrobacterium</i> with pre-cultured callus.	2017	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Agro-climatic conditions of North-East India are very complex and rice cultivars present in the region have been adapted to grow under harsh environmental conditions. Germplasm present in the region is considered to possess several important and unique traits that are of importance in rice improvement programs. Genetic engineering is a powerful tool to introduce new traits into crop plants. However, not much information is available on the methods to introduce foreign genes into North-East rice cultivars. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop transformation procedures for fast recovery of transgenic plants from North-East rice cultivars. To achieve this objective, a systematic study was carried out to identify media components and culture conditions for efficient embryogenic callus induction from the mature seeds and differentiation of callus into plantlets from two North-East deep water rice cultivars, Taothabi and Khongan. Also, role of preculture of callus on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was studied. Co-cultivation of Agrobacterium with 1-5 days precultured callus was found to result in high frequency of transformation. Detailed characterization of transgenic lines confirmed stable integration of transgenes and expression of reporter gfp gene. The whole process starting from callus induction to regenerating of transgenic rice plants that can be established in the soil was achieved in about 35-45 days. The procedures developed were found to be applicable to a popular variety IR 64. Therefore, methods developed in this study should be useful not only to introduce new traits quickly but also to validate the function(s) of several candidate gene(s) identified under the functional genomics of rice.
28152098	Genome-wide association analysis for heat tolerance at flowering detected a large set of genes involved in adaptation to thermal and other stresses.	2017	PLoS One	Fertilization sensitivity to heat in rice is a major issue within climate change scenarios in the tropics. A panel of 167 indica landraces and improved varieties was phenotyped for spikelet sterility (SPKST) under 38°C during anthesis and for several secondary traits potentially affecting panicle micro-climate and thus the fertilization process. The panel was genotyped with an average density of one marker per 29 kb using genotyping by sequencing. Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) were conducted using three methods based on single marker regression, haplotype regression and simultaneous fitting of all markers, respectively. Fourteen loci significantly associated with SPKST under at least two GWAS methods were detected. A large number of associations was also detected for the secondary traits. Analysis of co-localization of SPKST associated loci with QTLs detected in progenies of bi-parental crosses reported in the literature allowed to narrow -down the position of eight of those QTLs, including the most documented one, qHTSF4.1. Gene families underlying loci associated with SPKST corresponded to functions ranging from sensing abiotic stresses and regulating plant response, such as wall-associated kinases and heat shock proteins, to cell division and gametophyte development. Analysis of diversity at the vicinity of loci associated with SPKST within the rice three thousand genomes, revealed widespread distribution of the favourable alleles across O. sativa genetic groups. However, few accessions assembled the favourable alleles at all loci. Effective donors included the heat tolerant variety N22 and some Indian and Taiwanese varieties. These results provide a basis for breeding for heat tolerance during anthesis and for functional validation of major loci governing this trait.
28101092	Frameshift Mutation Confers Function as Virulence Factor to Leucine-Rich Repeat Protein from <i>Acidovorax avenae</i>.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Many plant pathogens inject type III (T3SS) effectors into host cells to suppress host immunity and promote successful infection. The bacterial pathogen Acidovorax avenae causes brown stripe symptom in many species of monocotyledonous plants; however, individual strains of each pathogen infect only one host species. T3SS-deleted mutants of A. avenae K1 (virulent to rice) or N1141 (virulent to finger millet) caused no symptom in each host plant, suggesting that T3SS effectors are involved in the symptom formation. To identify T3SS effectors as virulence factors, we performed whole-genome and predictive analyses. Although the nucleotide sequence of the novel leucine-rich repeat protein (Lrp) gene of N1141 had high sequence identity with K1 Lrp, the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins were quite different due to a 1-bp insertion within the K1 Lrp gene. An Lrp-deleted K1 strain (KΔLrp) did not cause brown stripe symptom in rice (host plant for K1); by contrast, the analogous mutation in N1141 (NΔLrp) did not interfere with infection of finger millet. In addition, NΔLrp retained the ability to induce effector-triggered immunity (ETI), including hypersensitive response cell death and expression of ETI-related genes. These data indicated that K1 Lrp functions as a virulence factor in rice, whereas N1141 Lrp does not play a similar role in finger millet. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that K1 Lrp interacts with oryzain α, a pathogenesis-related protein of the cysteine protease family, whereas N1141 Lrp, which contains LRR domains, does not. This specific interaction between K1 Lrp and oryzain α was confirmed by Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in rice cells. Thus, K1 Lrp protein may have acquired its function as virulence factor in rice due to a frameshift mutation.
28103264	Quantitative Classification of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Root Length and Diameter Using Image Analysis.	2017	PLoS One	Quantitative study of root morphological characteristics of plants is helpful for understanding the relationships between their morphology and function. However, few studies and little detailed and accurate information of root characteristics were reported in fine-rooted plants like rice (Oryza sativa L.). The aims of this study were to quantitatively classify fine lateral roots (FLRs), thick lateral roots (TLRs), and nodal roots (NRs) and analyze their dynamics of mean diameter (MD), lengths and surface area percentage with growth stages in rice plant. Pot experiments were carried out during three years with three rice cultivars, three nitrogen (N) rates and three water regimes. In cultivar experiment, among the three cultivars, root length of 'Yangdao 6' was longest, while the MD of its FLR was the smallest, and the mean diameters for TLR and NR were the largest, the surface area percentage (SAP) of TLRs (SAPT) was the highest, indicating that Yangdao 6 has better nitrogen and water uptake ability. High N rate increased the length of different types of roots and increased the MD of lateral roots, decreased the SAP of FLRs (SAPF) and TLRs, but increased the SAP of NRs (SAPN). Moderate decrease of water supply increased root length and diameter, water stress increased the SAPF and SAPT, but decreased SAPN. The quantitative results indicate that rice plant tends to increase lateral roots to get more surface area for nitrogen and water uptake when available assimilates are limiting under nitrogen and water stress environments.
28149257	PCR-based assays for validation of single nucleotide polymorphism markers in rice and mungbean.	2017	Hereditas	BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are the method of choice for genetic analyses including diversity and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies. Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.

RESULTS: We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.

CONCLUSIONS: CEL-I genotyping performed better in terms of genotyping accuracy and costs than tetra markers. The method is highly useful for validating SNPs in small to medium size germplasm panels.
28106116	Overexpression of MoSM1, encoding for an immunity-inducing protein from Magnaporthe oryzae, in rice confers broad-spectrum resistance against fungal and bacterial diseases.	2017	Sci Rep	Potential of MoSM1, encoding for a cerato-platanin protein from Magnaporthe oryzae, in improvement of rice disease resistance was examined. Transient expression of MoSM1 in rice leaves initiated hypersensitive response and upregulated expression of defense genes. When transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, MoSM1 targeted to plasma membrane. The MoSM1-overexpressing (MoSM1-OE) transgenic rice lines showed an improved resistance, as revealed by the reduced disease severity and decreased in planta pathogen growth, against 2 strains belonging to two different races of M. oryzae, causing blast disease, and against 2 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial leaf blight disease. However, no alteration in resistance to sheath blight disease was observed in MoSM1-OE lines. The MoSM1-OE plants contained elevated levels of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) and constitutively activated the expression of SA and JA signaling-related regulatory and defense genes. Furthermore, the MoSM1-OE plants had no effect on drought and salt stress tolerance and on grain yield. We conclude that MoSM1 confers a broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens through modulating SA- and JA-mediated signaling pathways without any penalty on abiotic stress tolerance and grain yield, providing a promising potential for application of MoSM1 in improvement of disease resistance in crops.
28094280	Accumulation and transformation of inorganic and organic arsenic in rice and role of thiol-complexation to restrict their translocation to shoot.	2017	Sci Rep	Environmental contamination of arsenic (As) and its accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is of serious human health concern. In planta speciation of As is an important tool to understand As metabolism in plants. In the present study, we investigated root to shoot As translocation and speciation in rice exposed to inorganic and methylated As. Arsenate (AsV) and methylarsonate (MAV) were efficiently reduced to arsenite (AsIII) and MAIII, respectively in rice root and shoot but no trivalent form of dimethylarsinate (DMAV) was detected. Further, up to 48 and 83% of root As in AsV and MAV exposed plants, respectively were complexed with various thiols showing up to 20 and 16 As species, respectively. Several mixed As- and MA-complexes with hydroxymethyl-phytochelatin, DesGly-phytochelatin, hydroxymethyl-GSH and cysteine were identified in rice. Despite high complexation in roots, more As was translocated to shoots in MAV exposed plants than AsV, with shoot/root As transfer factor being in order DMAV > MAV > AsV. Moreover, in shoots 78% MAIII and 71% AsIII were present as weakly bound species which is alarming, as MAIII has been found to be more cytotoxic than AsIII for human and it could also be an important factor inducing straighthead (spikelet sterility disorder) in rice.
28400748	Short-Term Exposure of Paddy Soil Microbial Communities to Salt Stress Triggers Different Transcriptional Responses of Key Taxonomic Groups.	2017	Front Microbiol	Soil salinization due to seawater intrusion along coastal areas is an increasing threat to rice cultivation worldwide. While the detrimental impact on rice growth and yield has been thoroughly studied, little is known about how severe salinity affects structure and function of paddy soil microbial communities. Here, we examined their short-term responses to half- and full-strength seawater salinity in controlled laboratory experiments. Slurry microcosms were incubated under anoxic conditions, with rice straw added as carbon source. Stress exposure time was for 2 days after a pre-incubation period of 7 days. Relative to the control, moderate (300 mM NaCl) and high (600 mM NaCl) salt stress suppressed both net consumption of acetate and methane production by 50% and 70%, respectively. Correspondingly, community-wide mRNA expression decreased by 50-65%, with significant changes in relative transcript abundance of family-level groups. mRNA turnover was clearly more responsive to salt stress than rRNA dynamics. Among bacteria, Clostridiaceae were most abundant and the only group whose transcriptional activity was strongly stimulated at 600 mM NaCl. In particular, clostridial mRNA involved in transcription/translation, fermentation, uptake and biosynthesis of compatible solutes, and flagellar motility was significantly enriched in response salt stress. None of the other bacterial groups were able to compete at 600 mM NaCl. Their responses to 300 mM NaCl were more diverse. Lachnospiraceae increased, Ruminococcaceae maintained, and Peptococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Syntrophomonadaceae decreased in relative mRNA abundance. Among methanogens, Methanosarcinaceae were most dominant. Relative to other family-level groups, salt stress induced a significant enrichment of transcripts related to the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase complex, methanogenesis, heat shock, ammonium uptake, and thermosomes, but the absolute abundance of methanosarcinal mRNA decreased. Most strikingly, the transcriptional activity of the Methanocellaceae was completely suppressed already at 300 mM NaCl. Apparently, the key taxonomic groups involved in the methanogenic breakdown of plant polymers significantly differ in their ability to cope with severe salt stress. Presumably, this different ability is directly linked to differences in their genetic potential and metabolic flexibility to reassign available energy resources for cellular adaptation to salt stress.
28255554	Expression Analysis of Hairpin RNA Carrying <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) Derived Sequences and Transgenic Resistance Development in a Model Rice Plant.	2017	Biomed Res Int	Developing transgenic resistance in monocotyledonous crops against pathogens remains a challenging area of research. Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is a serious pathogen of many monocotyledonous crops including sugarcane. The objective of present study was to analyze transgenic expression of hairpin RNA (hpRNA), targeting simultaneously CP (Coat Protein) and Hc-Pro (helper component-proteinase) genes of SCMV, in a model rice plant. Conserved nucleotide sequences, exclusive for DAG (Aspartic acid-Alanine-Glycine) and KITC (Lycine-Isoleucine-Threonine-Cysteine) motifs, derived from SCMV CP and Hc-Pro genes, respectively, were fused together and assembled into the hpRNA cassette under maize ubiquitin promoter to form Ubi-hpCP:Hc-Pro construct. The same CP:Hc-Pro sequence was fused with the β-glucuronidase gene (GUS) at the 3' end under CaMV 35S promoter to develop 35S-GUS:CP:Hc-Pro served as a target reporter gene construct. When delivered into rice callus tissues by particle bombardment, the Ubi-hpCP:Hc-Pro construct induced strong silencing of 35S-GUS:CP:Hc-Pro. Transgenic rice plants, containing Ubi-hpCP:Hc-Pro construct, expressed high level of 21-24 nt small interfering RNAs, which induced specific suppression against GUS:CP:Hc-Pro delivered by particle bombardment and conferred strong resistance to mechanically inoculated SCMV. It is concluded that fusion hpRNA approach is an affordable method for developing resistance against SCMV in model rice plant and it could confer SCMV resistance when transformed into sugarcane.
28149701	RelocaTE2: a high resolution transposable element insertion site mapping tool for population resequencing.	2017	PeerJ	BACKGROUND: Transposable element (TE) polymorphisms are important components of population genetic variation. The functional impacts of TEs in gene regulation and generating genetic diversity have been observed in multiple species, but the frequency and magnitude of TE variation is under appreciated. Inexpensive and deep sequencing technology has made it affordable to apply population genetic methods to whole genomes with methods that identify single nucleotide and insertion/deletion polymorphisms. However, identifying TE polymorphisms, particularly transposition events or non-reference insertion sites can be challenging due to the repetitive nature of these sequences, which hamper both the sensitivity and specificity of analysis tools.

METHODS: We have developed the tool RelocaTE2 for identification of TE insertion sites at high sensitivity and specificity. RelocaTE2 searches for known TE sequences in whole genome sequencing reads from second generation sequencing platforms such as Illumina. These sequence reads are used as seeds to pinpoint chromosome locations where TEs have transposed. RelocaTE2 detects target site duplication (TSD) of TE insertions allowing it to report TE polymorphism loci with single base pair precision.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The performance of RelocaTE2 is evaluated using both simulated and real sequence data. RelocaTE2 demonstrate high level of sensitivity and specificity, particularly when the sequence coverage is not shallow. In comparison to other tools tested, RelocaTE2 achieves the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. In particular, RelocaTE2 performs best in prediction of TSDs for TE insertions. Even in highly repetitive regions, such as those tested on rice chromosome 4, RelocaTE2 is able to report up to 95% of simulated TE insertions with less than 0.1% false positive rate using 10-fold genome coverage resequencing data. RelocaTE2 provides a robust solution to identify TE insertion sites and can be incorporated into analysis workflows in support of describing the complete genotype from light coverage genome sequencing.
28424710	Identification and Characterization of microRNA319a and Its Putative Target Gene, <i>PvPCF5</i>, in the Bioenergy Grass Switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Due to its high biomass yield, low environmental impact, and widespread adaptability to poor soils and harsh conditions, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a warm-region perennial herbaceous plant, has attracted much attention in recent years. However, little is known about microRNAs (miRNAs) and their functions in this bioenergy grass. Here, we identified and characterized a miRNA gene, Pvi-MIR319a, encoding microRNA319a in switchgrass. Transgenic rice lines generated by overexpressing the Pvi-MIR319a precursor gene exhibited broader leaves and delayed flowering compared with the control. Gene expression analysis indicated at least four putative target genes were downregulated. Additionally, we cloned a putative target gene (PvPCF5) of Pvi-MIR319a from switchgrass. PvPCF5, a TCP transcription factor, is a nuclear-localized protein with transactivation activity and control the development of leaf. Our results suggest that Pvi-MIR319a and its target genes may be used as potential genetic regulators for future switchgrass genetic improvement.
28119704	Transcriptome Analysis of <i>Hamelia patens</i> (Rubiaceae) Anthers Reveals Candidate Genes for Tapetum and Pollen Wall Development.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Studies of the anther transcriptome on non-model plants without a known genome are surprisingly scarce. RNA-Seq and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling provides a comprehensive approach to identify candidate genes contributing to developmental processes in non-model species. Here we built a transcriptome library of developing anthers of Hamelia patens and analyzed DGE profiles from each stage to identify genes that regulate tapetum and pollen development. In total 7,720 putative differentially expressed genes across four anther stages were identified. The number of putative stage-specific genes was: 776 at microspore mother cell stage, 807 at tetrad stage, 322 at uninucleate microspore stage, and the highest number (1,864) at bicellular pollen stage. GO enrichment analysis revealed 243 differentially expressed and 108 stage-specific genes that are potentially related to tapetum development, sporopollenin synthesis, and pollen wall. The number of expressed genes, their function and expression profiles were all significantly correlated with anther developmental processes. Overall comparisons of anther and pollen transcriptomes with those of rice and Arabidopsis together with the expression profiles of homologs of known anther-expressed genes, revealed conserved patterns and also divergence. The divergence may reflect taxon-specific differences in gene expression, the use RNA-seq as a more sensitive methodology, variation in tissue composition and sampling strategies. Given the lack of genomic sequence, this study succeeded in assigning putative identity to a significant proportion of anther-expressed genes and genes relevant to tapetum and pollen development in H. patens. The anther transcriptome revealed a molecular distinction between developmental stages, serving as a resource to unravel the functions of genes involved in anther development in H. patens and informing the analysis of other members of the Rubiaceae.
28117452	The relationship between vacuolation and initiation of PCD in rice (Oryza sativa) aleurone cells.	2017	Sci Rep	Vacuole fusion is a necessary process for the establishment of a large central vacuole, which is the central location of various hydrolytic enzymes and other factors involved in death at the beginning of plant programmed cell death (PCD). In our report, the fusion of vacuoles has been presented in two ways: i) small vacuoles coalesce to form larger vacuoles through membrane fusion, and ii) larger vacuoles combine with small vacuoles when small vacuoles embed into larger vacuoles. Regardless of how fusion occurs, a large central vacuole is formed in rice (Oryza sativa) aleurone cells. Along with the development of vacuolation, the rupture of the large central vacuole leads to the loss of the intact plasma membrane and the degradation of the nucleus, resulting in cell death. Stabilizing or disrupting the structure of actin filaments (AFs) inhibits or promotes the fusion of vacuoles, which delays or induces PCD. In addition, the inhibitors of the vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) and cathepsin B (CathB) block the occurrence of the large central vacuole and delay the progression of PCD in rice aleurone layers. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the rupture of the large central vacuole triggering the PCD in aleruone layers.
28069706	DNA sequence properties that predict susceptibility to epiallelic switching.	2017	EMBO J	Transgenerationally heritable epialleles are defined by the stable propagation of alternative transcriptional states through mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. Given that the propagation of DNA methylation at CpG sites, mediated in Arabidopsis by MET1, plays a central role in epigenetic inheritance, we examined genomewide DNA methylation in partial and complete loss-of-function met1 mutants. We interpreted the data in relation to transgenerational epiallelic stability, which allowed us to classify chromosomal targets of epigenetic regulation into (i) single copy and methylated exclusively at CpGs, readily forming epialleles, and (ii) transposon-derived, methylated at all cytosines, which may or may not form epialleles. We provide evidence that DNA sequence features such as density of CpGs and genomic repetitiveness of the loci predispose their susceptibility to epiallelic switching. The importance and predictive power of these genetic features were confirmed by analyses of common epialleles in natural Arabidopsis accessions, epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) and also verified in rice.
28223994	Enhanced Grain Iron Levels in Rice Expressing an <i>IRON-REGULATED METAL TRANSPORTER, NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE</i>, and <i>FERRITIN</i> Gene Cassette.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Micronutrient malnutrition is widespread, especially in poor populations across the globe, and iron deficiency anemia is one of the most prevalent forms of micronutrient deficiencies. Iron deficiency anemia has severe consequences for human health, working ability, and quality of life. Several interventions including iron supplementation and food fortification have been attempted and met with varied degrees of success. Rice, which is a staple food for over half of the world's population, is an important target crop for iron biofortification. The genetic variability of iron content in the rice germplasm is very narrow, and thus, conventional breeding has not been successful in developing high iron rice varieties. Therefore, genetic engineering approaches have targeted at increasing iron uptake, translocation, and storage in the rice endosperm. We previously reported that AtIRT1, when expressed together with AtNAS1 and PvFERRITIN (PvFER) in high-iron (NFP) rice, has a synergistic effect of further increasing the iron concentration of polished rice grains. We have now engineered rice expressing AtIRT1, AtNAS1, and PvFER as a single locus gene cassette and compared the resulting lines with transgenic lines expressing AtIRT1 and PvFER gene cassettes. We also evaluated the efficacies of the MsENOD12B and native AtIRT1 promoters for the expression of AtIRT1 in rice in both types of gene cassettes, and found the native AtIRT1 promoter to be a better choice for driving the AtIRT1 expression in our biofortification strategy. All the single insertion transgenic lines have significant increases of iron concentration, both in polished and unpolished grains, but the concerted expression of AtIRT1, AtNAS1, and PvFER resulted to be a more effective strategy in achieving the highest iron increases of up to 10.46 μg/g dry weight. Furthermore, the transformed high iron lines grew better under iron deficiency growth conditions and also have significantly increased grain zinc concentration. Together, these rice lines have nutritionally relevant increases in polished grain iron and zinc concentration necessary to support human health.
28265990	Interplay Between Auxin and Cytokinin and Its Impact on Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK).	2017	Methods Mol Biol	Plant physiology, in particular, is governed by a repertoire of endogenous as well as environmental cues. Auxin and cytokinin constitute an indispensable phytohormonal system required for plant growth and development. Another pivotal aspect of plant physiological process that thoroughly affects various plant growth and developmental attributes is the signaling network, majorly comprising the canonical mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Striking a fine balance between the phytohormonal and signaling components could be adopted as an intricate strategy by plants to counteract various stresses in question. Thus, a brief understanding of this multifaceted complex could be of use for delineating numerous plant physiological and developmental phenomena. Thus, the present section discusses the various MAPK related assays in context to auxin and cytokinin crosstalk. Briefly, this chapter outlines the discrete MAPK methods to better understand the fundamentals of MAPK signaling network in auxin and cytokinin treated rice seedlings. Further, various phenotypic, genomic as well as proteomic protocols are discussed for a better understanding of MAPK networks in the backdrop of auxin and cytokinin interplay.
28071676	Transcriptome analysis of neo-tetraploid rice reveals specific differential gene expressions associated with fertility and heterosis.	2017	Sci Rep	Polyploid rice hybrids have a powerful biological and yield potential that may become a new way for rice breeding; however, low fertility is major hindrance in commercial utilization. Here, we developed a neo-tetraploid rice that could overcome the sterility of autotetraploid rice and produce high heterosis. Transcriptome analysis of F1 hybrid developed by crossing neo-tetraploid with autotetraploid rice displayed 807, 663 and 866 differentially expressed genes that uniquely associated with F1 and specific to (DEGFu-sp) anther, ovary and leaf, respectively. Of the DEGFu-sp, 1224 genes displayed nonadditive expression; 44 and 10 genes were annotated as TFs and methyltransferase or hydroxymethyltransferase, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment and co-expression analysis revealed specific differential gene expressions in the DEGFu-sp to leaf, anther and ovary, such as genes related to photosynthesis, metabolic process and transport, and co-expression network including fertility, resistance and epigenetic elements. Of the DEGFu-sp to anther, 42 meiosis stage-specific genes, eight meiosis-related genes, such as RAD51 and SMC2, were identified. We identified 38 miRNAs from DEGFu-sp to anther, and their targets were associated with pollen fertility and retrotransposon protein. Our study provides new germplasm for polyploid rice breeding, and revealed complex regulatory mechanisms that might be associated with heterosis and fertility.
28303127	Functional Characterization of Endophytic Fungal Community Associated with <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. and <i>Zea mays</i> L.	2017	Front Microbiol	In a natural ecosystem, the plant is in a symbiotic relationship with beneficial endophytes contributing huge impact on its host plant. Therefore, exploring beneficial endophytes and understanding its interaction is a prospective area of research. The present work aims to characterize the fungal endophytic communities associated with healthy maize and rice plants and to study the deterministic factors influencing plant growth and biocontrol properties against phytopathogens, viz, Pythium ultimum, Sclerotium oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani, and Pyricularia oryzae. A total of 123 endophytic fungi was isolated using the culture-dependent approach from different tissue parts of the plant. Most dominating fungal endophyte associated with both the crops belong to genus Fusarium, Sarocladium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium and their occurrence was not tissue specific. The isolates were screened for in vitro plant growth promotion, stress tolerance, disease suppressive mechanisms and based on the results, each culture from both the cereal crops was selected for further study. Acremonium sp. (ENF 31) and Penicillium simplicisssum (ENF22), isolated from maize and rice respectively could potentially inhibit the growth of all the tested pathogens with 46.47 ± 0.16 mm to 60.09 ± 0.04 mm range zone of inhibition for ENF31 and 35.48 ± 0.14 to 62.29 ± 0.15 mm for ENF22. Both significantly produce the defensive enzymes, ENF31 could tolerate a wide range of pH from 2 to 12, very important criteria, for studying plant growth in different soil types, especially acidic as it is widely prevalent here, making more land unsuitable for cultivation. ENF22 grows in pH range 3-12, with 10% salt tolerating ability, another factor of consideration. Study of root colonization during 7th to 30th days of growth phase reveals that ENF31 could colonize pleasantly in rice, though a maize origin, ranging from 1.02 to 1.21 log10 CFU/g root and in maize, it steadily colonizes ranging from 0.95 to 1.18 log10 CFU, while ENF22 could colonize from 0.98 to 1.24 Log10CFU/g root in rice and 1.01 to 1.24Log10CFU/g root in maize, just the reverse observed in Acremonium sp. Therefore, both the organism has the potency of a promising Bio-resource agent, that we must definitely explore to fill the gap in the agriculture industry.
28144247	Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Causal Mutations in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	Next-generation sequencing technologies (NGST) are being used to discover causal mutations in ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized plant populations. However, the published protocols often deliver too many candidate sites and sometimes fail to find the mutant gene of interest. Accurate identification of the causal mutation from massive background polymorphisms and sequencing deficiencies remains challenging. Here we describe a NGST-based method, named SIMM, that can simultaneously identify the causal mutations in multiple independent mutants. Multiple rice mutants derived from the same parental line were back-crossed, and for each mutant, the derived F2 individuals of the recessive mutant phenotype were pooled and sequenced. The resulting sequences were aligned to the Nipponbare reference genome, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were subsequently compared among the mutants. Allele index (AI) and Euclidean distance (ED) were incorporated into the analysis to reduce noises caused by background polymorphisms and re-sequencing errors. Corrections of sequence bias against GC- and AT-rich sequences in the candidate region were conducted when necessary. Using this method, we successfully identified seven new mutant alleles from Huanghuazhan (HHZ), an elite indica rice cultivar in China. All mutant alleles were validated by phenotype association assay. A pipeline based on Perl scripts for SIMM is publicly available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/simm/.
28250591	A novel GRAS transcription factor, <i>ZmGRAS20</i>, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.	2017	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Starch occupies the maximal component of cereal grains and is pivotal for maize yield and quality. However, the regulatory mechanism of starch synthesis is still poorly understand. In this study, a GRAS transcription factor, ZmGRAS20, was isolated from maize inbred line B73 based on transcriptome sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that ZmGRAS20 is specifically expressed in maize endosperm. Transient expression of ZmGRAS20-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in tobacco cells showed a nucleus and membrane localization of the protein. Transactivation assay of ZmGRAS20 demonstrated that it has no transactivation activity in yeast cells. Overexpression of ZmGRAS20 led to a chalky region of ventral endosperm with decreased starch content and defective agronomic characters in transgenic seeds. Moreover, ZmGRAS20-overexpression plants had fewer fractions of long-branched starch chains. Further scanning electron microscopy observation of ZmGRAS20 transgenic seeds exhibited altered starch granules morphology compared with wide type plants. Taken together, these results suggested that ZmGRAS20 may function as a starch synthesis regulatory factor in rice endosperm.
28070613	The plant growth-promoting effect of the nitrogen-fixing endophyte Pseudomonas stutzeri A15.	2017	Arch Microbiol	The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria as a sustainable alternative for chemical nitrogen fertilizers has been explored for many economically important crops. For one such strain isolated from rice rhizosphere and endosphere, nitrogen-fixing Pseudomonas stutzeri A15, unequivocal evidence of the plant growth-promoting effect and the potential contribution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the effect of P. stutzeri A15 inoculation on the growth of rice seedlings in greenhouse conditions. P. stutzeri A15 induced significant growth promotion compared to uninoculated rice seedlings. Furthermore, inoculation with strain A15 performed significantly better than chemical nitrogen fertilization, clearly pointing to the potential of this bacterium as biofertilizer. To assess the contribution of BNF to the plant growth-promoting effect, rice seedlings were also inoculated with a nitrogen fixation-deficient mutant. Our results suggest that BNF (at best) only partially contributes to the stimulation of plant growth.
28054169	Constitutive expression of a plant ferredoxin-like protein (pflp) enhances capacity of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	Transgenic Res	The plant ferredoxin-like protein (PFLP) gene, cloned from sweet peppers predicted as an electron carrier in photosynthesis, shows high homology to the Fd-I sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, Oryza sativa and Spinacia oleracea. Most of pflp related studies focused on anti-pathogenic effects, while less understanding for the effects in photosynthesis with physiological aspects, such as photosynthesis rate, and levels of carbohydrate metabolites. This project focuses on the effects of pflp overexpression on photosynthesis by physiological evaluations of carbon assimilation with significant higher levels of carbohydrates with higher photosynthesis efficiency. In this report, two independent transgenic lines of rice plants (designated as pflp-1 and pflp-2) were generated from non-transgenic TNG67 rice plant (WT). Both transgenic pflp rice plants exhibited enhanced photosynthesis efficiency, and gas exchange rates of photosynthesis were 1.3- and 1.2-fold higher for pflp-1 and pflp-2 than WT respectively. Significantly higher electron transport rates of pflp rice plants were observed. Moreover, photosynthetic products, such as fructose, glucose, sucrose and starch contents of pflp transgenic lines were increased accordingly. Molecular evidences of carbohydrate metabolism related genes activities (osHXK5, osHXK6, osAGPL3, osAGPS2α, osSPS, ospFBPase, oscFBPase, and osSBPase) in transgenic lines were higher than those of WT. For performance of crop production, 1000-grain weight for pflp-1 and pflp-2 rice plants were 52.9 and 41.1 g that were both significantly higher than 31.6 g for WT, and panicles weights were 1.4- and 1.2-fold higher than WT. Panicle number, tiller number per plants for pflp rice plants were all significantly higher compared with those of WT where there was no significant difference observed between two pflp rice plants. Taken altogether; this study demonstrated that constitutive pflp expression can improve rice production by enhancing the capacity of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.
27852012	Analysis of Ribosome-Associated mRNAs in Rice Reveals the Importance of Transcript Size and GC Content in Translation.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Gene expression is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels including decoding of messenger RNA (mRNA) into polypeptides via ribosome-mediated translation. Translational regulation has been intensively studied in the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and in this study, we assessed the translational status [proportion of steady-state mRNA associated with ribosomes] of mRNAs by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification followed by mRNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) in rice (Oryza sativa), a model monocot plant and the most important food crop. A survey of three tissues found that most transcribed rice genes are translated whereas few transposable elements are associated with ribosomes. Genes with short and GC-rich coding regions are overrepresented in ribosome-associated mRNAs, suggesting that the GC-richness characteristic of coding sequences in grasses may be an adaptation that favors efficient translation. Transcripts with retained introns and extended 5' untranslated regions are underrepresented on ribosomes, and rice genes belonging to different evolutionary lineages exhibited differential enrichment on the ribosomes that was associated with GC content. Genes involved in photosynthesis and stress responses are preferentially associated with ribosomes, whereas genes in epigenetic regulation pathways are the least enriched on ribosomes. Such variation is more dramatic in rice than that in Arabidopsis and is correlated with the wide variation of GC content of transcripts in rice. Taken together, variation in the translation status of individual transcripts reflects important mechanisms of gene regulation, which may have a role in evolution and diversification.
28228768	Genome-Wide Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in CMS and Restorer Lines Discovered by Genotyping Using Sequencing and Association with Marker-Combining Ability for 12 Yield-Related Traits in <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. subsp. Japonica.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Heterosis or hybrid vigor is closely related with general combing ability (GCA) of parents and special combining ability (SCA) of combinations. The evaluation of GCA and SCA facilitate selection of parents and combinations in heterosis breeding. In order to improve combining ability (CA) by molecular marker assist selection, it is necessary to identify marker loci associated with the CA. To identify the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci associated with CA in the parental genomes of japonica rice, genome-wide discovered SNP loci were tested for association with the CA of 18 parents for 12 yield-related traits. In this study, 81 hybrids were created and evaluated to calculate the CA of 18 parents. The parents were sequenced by genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method for identification of genome-wide SNPs. The analysis of GBS indicated that the successful mapping of 9.86 × 106 short reads in the Nipponbare reference genome consists of 39,001 SNPs in parental genomes at 11,085 chromosomal positions. The discovered SNPs were non-randomly distributed within and among the 12 chromosomes of rice. Overall, 20.4% (8026) of the discovered SNPs were coding types, and 8.6% (3344) and 9.9% (3951) of the SNPs revealed synonymous and non-synonymous changes, which provide valuable knowledge about the underlying performance of the parents. Furthermore, the associations between SNPs and CA indicated that 362 SNP loci were significantly related to the CA of 12 parental traits. The identified SNP loci of CA in our study were distributed genome wide and caused a positive or negative effect on the CA of traits. For the yield-related traits, such as grain thickness, days to heading, panicle length, grain length and 1000-grain weight, a maximum number of positive SNP loci of CA were found in CMS A171 and in the restorers LC64 and LR27. On an individual basis, some of associated loci that resided on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 9, and 11 recorded maximum positive values for the CA of traits. From our results, we suggest that heterosis in japonica rice would be improved by pyramiding the favorable SNP loci of CA and eliminating the unfavorable loci from parental genomes.
28143411	Genome-Wide analysis of the AAAP gene family in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis).	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Members of the amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) gene family play indispensable roles in various plant metabolism and biosynthesis processes. Comprehensive analysis of AAAP genes has been conducted in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and poplar, but has not been reported from moso bamboo. Phylogenetics, evolutionary patterns and further expression profiles analysis of the AAAP gene family in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) will increase our understanding of this important gene family.

RESULTS: In this current study, we conducted phylogenetic, gene structure, promoter region, divergence time, expression patterns and qRT-PCR analysis of the 55 predicted AAAP genes in moso bamboo based on the availability of the moso bamboo genome sequence. We identified 55 putative AAAP (PeAAAP1-55) genes, which were divided into eight distinct subfamilies based on comparative phylogenetic analysis using 184 full-length protein sequences, including 55 sequences from moso bamboo, 58 sequences from rice and 71 sequences from maize. Analysis of evolutionary patterns and divergence showed that the PeAAAP genes have undergone a extensive duplication event approximately 12 million years ago (MYA) and that the split between AAAP family genes in moso bamboo and rice occurred approximately 27 MYA. The microarray analysis suggested that some genes play considerable roles in moso bamboo growth and development. We investigated the expression levels of the 16 AAP subfamily genes under abiotic stress (drought, salt and cold) by qRT-PCR to explore the potential contributions to stress response of individual PeAAAP genes in moso bamboo.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that PeAAAP genes play crucial roles in moso bamboo growth and development, especially in response to abiotic stress conditions. Our comprehensive, systematic study of the AAAPs gene family in moso bamboo will facilitate further analysis of the functions and evolution of AAAP genes in plants.
27987176	CSGRqtl: A Comparative Quantitative Trait Locus Database for Saccharinae Grasses.	2017	Methods Mol Biol	Conventional biparental quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has led to some successes in the identification of causal genes in many organisms. QTL likelihood intervals not only provide "prior information" for finer-resolution approaches such as GWAS but also provide better statistical power than GWAS to detect variants with low/rare frequency in a natural population. Here, we describe a new element of an ongoing effort to provide online resources to facilitate study and improvement of the important Saccharinae clade. The primary goal of this new resource is the anchoring of published QTLs for this clade to the Sorghum genome. Genetic map alignments translate a wealth of genomic information from sorghum to Saccharum spp., Miscanthus spp., and other taxa. In addition, genome alignments facilitate comparison of the Saccharinae QTL sets to those of other taxa that enjoy comparable resources, exemplified herein by rice.
27821516	Effects of pre-sowing seed treatments on establishment of dry direct-seeded early rice under chilling stress.	2016	AoB Plants	Mechanization and simplification are inevitable trends in agriculture production to decrease input demands and simultaneously improve resource use efficiency. Dry direct-seeded rice is a resource-saving cropping system and has been considered as a replacement for traditional transplanted rice. However, the poor establishment of dry direct-seeded early rice, primarily induced by chilling stress, has limited the wide adoption of this system. To examine the effects of pre-sowing seed treatments on rice germination, seedling growth and associated metabolic events under chilling stress, two seed coating treatments (Hanyubaomu coating and Miaoboshi coating) and two seed priming treatments (selenium priming and salicylic acid priming) were tested in field and growth chamber experiments. The results revealed that under chilling stress, seed priming increased the rice seed germination by 20.96-26.31 %. The length and weight of shoots and roots were also significantly increased. The two seed coating treatments were not effective in enhancing seed germination and seedling growth under chilling stress. The improved germination and seedling growth of primed seeds under chilling stress were strongly linked with higher α-amylase activity and total soluble sugar content. Conclusively, these findings will provide new avenues for understanding and advancing pre-sowing seed treatments of dry direct-seeded early rice.
27987179	Plant Promoter Database (PPDB).	2017	Methods Mol Biol	ppdb ( http://ppdb.agr.gifu-u.ac.jp ) is a web-based plant promoter database that provides promoter information of each gene in genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, and Physcomitrella patens. In this database, recognition of a promoter structure is achieved by annotating genome sequences with our sequence lists of bioinformatically identified octamers for core promoter structure (TATA boxes, Initiators, Y Patches, GA and CA Elements) and regulatory element groups (REGs), together with information of transcription start sites (TSSs) that have been experimentally identified. Our promoter elements are octamer sequences that show strongly biased localization profiles in the promoter region, extracted by the local distribution of short sequence (LDSS) analysis. In addition, REGs are linked with the information of the PLACE database and also with their physiological roles that are predicted using large-scale gene expression data.
28484477	Ancient Plant Glyoxylate/Succinic Semialdehyde Reductases: GLYR1s Are Cytosolic, Whereas GLYR2s Are Localized to Both Mitochondria and Plastids.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plant NADPH-dependent glyoxylate/succinic semialdehyde reductases 1 and 2 (GLYR1 and GLYR2) are considered to be involved in detoxifying harmful aldehydes, thereby preserving plant health during exposure to various abiotic stresses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two GLYR isoforms appeared in the plant lineage prior to the divergence of the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, which occurred approximately 750 million years ago. Green fluorescent protein fusions of apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana [L.] Heynh GLYRs were transiently expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum L.) suspension cells or Arabidopsis protoplasts, as well in methoxyfenozide-induced, stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings. The localization of apple GLYR1 confirmed that this isoform is cytosolic, whereas apple, rice and Arabidopsis GLYR2s were localized to both mitochondria and plastids. These findings highlight the potential involvement of GLYRs within distinct compartments of the plant cell.
28220436	Chitin-Triggered MAPK Activation and ROS Generation in Rice Suspension-Cultured Cells.	2017	Methods Mol Biol	Suspension-cultured cells respond sensitively to a number of stimuli including pathogen-derived molecules. Therefore, they are used in a simple, single-cell model system in order to gain insights into immune signaling pathways in rice. Here we describe protocols for studying chitin-induced MAPK activation and ROS generation in rice suspension-cultured cells.
28081161	Factors Related with CH4 and N2O Emissions from a Paddy Field: Clues for Management implications.	2017	PLoS One	Paddy fields are major sources of global atmospheric greenhouse gases, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The different phases previous to emission (production, transport, diffusion, dissolution in pore water and ebullition) despite well-established have rarely been measured in field conditions. We examined them and their relationships with temperature, soil traits and plant biomass in a paddy field in Fujian, southeastern China. CH4 emission was positively correlated with CH4 production, plant-mediated transport, ebullition, diffusion, and concentration of dissolved CH4 in porewater and negatively correlated with sulfate concentration, suggesting the potential use of sulfate fertilizers to mitigate CH4 release. Air temperature and humidity, plant stem biomass, and concentrations of soil sulfate, available N, and DOC together accounted for 92% of the variance in CH4 emission, and Eh, pH, and the concentrations of available N and Fe3+, leaf biomass, and air temperature 95% of the N2O emission. Given the positive correlations between CH4 emission and DOC content and plant biomass, reduce the addition of a carbon substrate such as straw and the development of smaller but higher yielding rice genotypes could be viable options for reducing the release of greenhouse gases from paddy fields to the atmosphere.
28373862	Microbial Abundances Predict Methane and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes from a Windrow Composting System.	2017	Front Microbiol	Manure composting is a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) that are two potent greenhouse gases. The CH4 and N2O fluxes are mediated by methanogens and methanotrophs, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in composting manure, respectively, while these specific bacterial functional groups may interplay in CH4 and N2O emissions during manure composting. To test the hypothesis that bacterial functional gene abundances regulate greenhouse gas fluxes in windrow composting systems, CH4 and N2O fluxes were simultaneously measured using the chamber method, and molecular techniques were used to quantify the abundances of CH4-related functional genes (mcrA and pmoA genes) and N2O-related functional genes (amoA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB, and nosZ genes). The results indicate that changes in interacting physicochemical parameters in the pile shaped the dynamics of bacterial functional gene abundances. The CH4 and N2O fluxes were correlated with abundances of specific compositional genes in bacterial community. The stepwise regression statistics selected pile temperature, mcrA and NH4+ together as the best predictors for CH4 fluxes, and the model integrating nirK, nosZ with pmoA gene abundances can almost fully explain the dynamics of N2O fluxes over windrow composting. The simulated models were tested against measurements in paddy rice cropping systems, indicating that the models can also be applicable to predicting the response of CH4 and N2O fluxes to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and rising temperature. Microbial abundances could be included as indicators in the current carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical models.
28100213	Transcriptomic response of wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, to transgenic rice expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab protein.	2017	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Bacillum thuringiensis (Bt) toxin produced in Cry1-expressing genetically modified rice (Bt rice) is highly effective to control lepidopteran pests, which reduces the needs for synthetic insecticides. Non-target organisms can be exposed to Bt toxins through direct feeding or trophic interactions in the field. The wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata, one of the dominant predators in South China, plays a crucial role in the rice agroecosystem. In this study, we investigated transcriptome responses of the 5th instar spiders fed on preys maintained on Bt- and non-Bt rice.

RESULTS: Comparative transcriptome analysis resulted in 136 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spiderlings preying upon N. lugens fed on Bt- and non-Bt rice (Bt- and non-Bt spiderlings). Functional analysis indicated a potential impact of Bt toxin on the formation of new cuticles during molting. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that GO terms associated with chitin or cuticle, including "chitin binding", "chitin metabolic process", "chitin synthase activity", "cuticle chitin biosynthetic process", "cuticle hydrocarbon biosynthetic process", and "structural constituent of cuticle", and an array of amino acid metabolic pathways, including "alanine, asparatate and glutamate metabolism", "glycine, serine and theronine metabolism", "cysteine and methionine metabolism", "tyrosine metabolism", "phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine", and "tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis" were significantly influenced in response to Cry1Ab.

CONCLUSIONS: The Cry1Ab may have a negative impact on the formation of new cuticles during molting, which is contributed to the delayed development of spiderlings. To validate these transcriptomic responses, further examination at the translational level will be warranted.
28059483	Ectopic expression of fungal EcGDH improves nitrogen assimilation and grain yield in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	NADP(H)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH) in lower organisms have stronger ammonium affinity than those in higher plants. Here we report that transgenic rice overexpressing the EcGDH from Eurotium cheralieri exhibited significantly enhanced aminating activities. Hydroponic and field tests showed that nitrogen assimilation efficiency and grain yields were markedly increased in these transgenic plants, especially at the low nitrogen conditions. These results suggest that EcGDH may have potential to be used to improve nitrogen assimilation and grain yield in rice.
28149305	Genetic Modification for Improving Seed Vigor Is Transitioning from Model Plants to Crop Plants.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Although seed vigor is a complex physiological trait controlled by quantitative trait loci, technological advances in the laboratory are being translated into applications for enhancing seed vigor in crop plants. In this article, we summarize and discuss pioneering work in the genetic modification of seed vigor, especially through the over-expression of protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT, EC 2.1.1.77) in seeds. The impressive success in improving rice seed vigor through the over-expression of PIMT provides a valuable reference for engineering high-vigor seeds for crop production. In recent decades, numerous genes/proteins associated with seed vigor have been identified. It is hoped that such potential candidates may be used in the development of genetically edited crops for a high and stable yield potential in crop production. This possibility is very valuable in the context of a changing climate and increasing world population.
28444369	Three-dimensional intracellular structure of a whole rice mesophyll cell observed with FIB-SEM.	2017	Ann Bot	Background and Aims: Ultrathin sections of rice leaf blades observed two-dimensionally using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) show that the chlorenchyma is composed of lobed mesophyll cells, with intricate cell boundaries, and lined with chloroplasts. The lobed cell shape and chloroplast positioning are believed to enhance the area available for the gas exchange surface for photosynthesis in rice leaves. However, a cell image revealing the three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructure of rice mesophyll cells has not been visualized. In this study, a whole rice mesophyll cell was observed using a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), which provides many serial sections automatically, rapidly and correctly, thereby enabling 3-D cell structure reconstruction.

Methods: Rice leaf blades were fixed chemically using the method for conventional TEM observation, embedded in resin and subsequently set in the FIB-SEM chamber. Specimen blocks were sectioned transversely using the FIB, and block-face images were captured using the SEM. The sectioning and imaging were repeated overnight for 200-500 slices (each 50 nm thick). The resultant large-volume image stacks ( x = 25 μm, y = 25 μm, z = 10-25 μm) contained one or two whole mesophyll cells. The 3-D models of whole mesophyll cells were reconstructed using image processing software.

Key Results: The reconstructed cell models were discoid shaped with several lobes around the cell periphery. The cell shape increased the surface area, and the ratio of surface area to volume was twice that of a cylinder having the same volume. The chloroplasts occupied half the cell volume and spread as sheets along the cell lobes, covering most of the inner cell surface, with adjacent chloroplasts in close contact with each other.

Conclusions: Cellular and sub-cellular ultrastructures of a whole mesophyll cell in a rice leaf blade are demonstrated three-dimensionally using a FIB-SEM. The 3-D models and numerical information support the hypothesis that rice mesophyll cells enhance their CO 2 absorption with increased cell surface and sheet-shaped chloroplasts.
28421550	Distribution, genetic diversity and potential spatiotemporal scale of alien gene flow in crop wild relatives of rice (Oryza spp.) in Colombia.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Crop wild relatives (CWRs) of rice hold important traits that can contribute to enhancing the ability of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima) to produce higher yields, cope with the effects of climate change, and resist attacks of pests and diseases, among others. However, the genetic resources of these species remain dramatically understudied, putting at risk their future availability from in situ and ex situ sources. Here we assess the distribution of genetic diversity of the four rice CWRs known to occur in Colombia (O. glumaepatula, O. alta, O. grandiglumis, and O. latifolia). Furthermore, we estimated the degree of overlap between areas with suitable habitat for cultivated and wild rice, both under current and predicted future climate conditions to assess the potential spatiotemporal scale of potential gene flow from GM rice to its CWRs.

RESULTS: Our findings suggest that part of the observed genetic diversity and structure, at least of the most exhaustively sampled species, may be explained by their glacial and post-glacial range dynamics. Furthermore, in assessing the expected impact of climate change and the potential spatiotemporal scale of gene flow between populations of CWRs and GM rice we find significant overlap between present and future suitable areas for cultivated rice and its four CWRs. Climate change is expected to have relatively limited negative effects on the rice CWRs, with three species showing opportunities to expand their distribution ranges in the future.

CONCLUSIONS: Given (i) the sparse presence of CWR populations in protected areas (ii) the strong suitability overlap between cultivated rice and its four CWRs; and (iii) the complexity of managing and regulating areas to prevent alien gene flow, the first priority should be to establish representative ex situ collections for all CWR species, which currently do not exist. In the absence of studies under field conditions on the scale and extent of gene flow between cultivated rice and its Colombian CWRs, effective in situ conservation might best be achieved through tailor-made management plans and exclusion of GM rice cultivation in areas holding the most genetically diverse CWR populations. This may be combined with assisted migration of populations to suitable areas where rice is unlikely to be cultivated under current and future climate conditions.
28392385	Multi-scale structures and functional properties of starches from Indica hybrid, Japonica and waxy rice.	2017	Int J Biol Macromol	The structural and functional properties of starches from three rice grains differing in amylose content (19.9, 13.4 and 0.8% for Japonica, Indica hybrid and waxy rice, respectively) were investigated using a range of characterization methods Indica hybrid starch (IHS) had the highest proportion of intermediate (DP 13-24) and long branch chains (DP≥37) and the lowest proportion of short branch chains (DP 6-12), whereas the opposite results were observed for Japonica starch (JS). The results for waxy rice starch (WS) were between those of IHS and JS. Rice starches showed a typical A-type X-ray diffraction pattern with the relative crystallinity ranging from 33.4% for JS to 39.4% for WS. Significant differences were observed in lamellar distance and short-range molecular order characterized by IR ratio of absorbances at 1047/1022cm-1 and full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the band at 480cm-1. WS showed a higher swelling power and a lower close packing concentration at temperatures from 60 to 90°C. The lower peak viscosity of WS was attributed to the formation of less rigid swollen granules at a concentrated regime. WS showed a higher in vitro digestibility compared with IHS and JS.
28450374	Genetic Architecture of a Rice Nested Association Mapping Population.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Describing the genetic diversity in the gene pool of crops will provide breeders with novel resources for varietal improvement. Nested Association Mapping (NAM) populations are uniquely suited for characterizing parental diversity through the shuffling and fixation of parental haplotypes. Here, we describe a set of 1879 rice NAM lines created through the selfing and single-seed descent of F1 hybrids derived from elite IR64 indica crossed with 10 diverse tropical japonica lines. Genotyping data indicated tropical japonica alleles were captured at every queried locus despite the presence of segregation distortion factors. Several distortion loci were mapped, both shared and unique, among the 10 populations. Using two-point and multi-point genetic map calculations, our datasets achieved the ∼1500 cM expected map size in rice. Finally, we highlighted the utility of the NAM lines for QTL mapping, including joint analysis across the 10 populations, by confirming known QTL locations for the trait days to heading.
28382632	A phosphoproteomic landscape of rice (Oryza sativa) tissues.	2017	Physiol Plant	Protein phosphorylation is an important posttranslational modification that regulates various plant developmental processes. Here, we report a comprehensive, quantitative phosphoproteomic profile of six rice tissues, including callus, leaf, root, shoot meristem, young panicle and mature panicle from Nipponbare by employing a mass spectrometry (MS)-based, label-free approach. A total of 7171 unique phosphorylation sites in 4792 phosphopeptides from 2657 phosphoproteins were identified, of which 4613 peptides were differentially phosphorylated (DP) among the tissues. Motif-X analysis revealed eight significantly enriched motifs, such as [sP], [Rxxs] and [tP] from the rice phosphosites. Hierarchical clustering analysis divided the DP peptides into 63 subgroups, which showed divergent spatial-phosphorylation patterns among tissues. These clustered proteins are functionally related to nutrition uptake in roots, photosynthesis in leaves and tissue differentiation in panicles. Phosphorylations were specific in the tissues where the target proteins execute their functions, suggesting that phosphorylation might be a key mechanism to regulate the protein activity in different tissues. This study greatly expands the rice phosphoproteomic dataset, and also offers insight into the regulatory roles of phosphorylation in tissue development and functions.
28444595	Cloning and characterization of auxin efflux carrier genes EcPIN1a and EcPIN1b from finger millet Eleusine coracana L.	2017	3 Biotech	Auxin signaling events in plants play important role in developmental regulation as well as gravitropic responses and plays crucial role in the development of root, lateral root and root hairs. The gene that is known to be most important in the development of root, lateral root and root hairs is commonly known as auxin efflux carrier (PIN). Being commonly known as orphan plant, the genome sequence of Eleusine coracana is not known yet, and hence it was very difficult to conduct advanced research in root development in this plant. As PIN gene plays crucial role in root development, to have some advanced study we proposed to clone the PIN genes from E. coracana. We cloned two PIN genes in E. coracana and named them as EcPIN1a and EcPIN1b. The coding sequence (CDS) of EcPIN1a was 1779 bp and EcPIN1b was 1788 bp long that encodes for 593 and 596 amino acids, respectively. In-silico analysis shows the presence of transmembrane domain in EcPIN1a and EcPIN1b protein. Multiple sequence alignment of EcPIN1a and EcPIN1b protein shows the presence of several conserved motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of EcPIN1a and EcPIN1b grouped with the PIN gene of monocot plant Oryza sativa. This shows that EcPIN genes were monocot specific, and closely match with the PIN genes of O. sativa. The transcript analysis of EcPIN1a gene in leaf tissue shows gradual up-regulation from 7th to 28th days of developmental time period while the transcript level was found to be lower in root tissue. The transcript abundance of EcPIN1b was not detected. Gradual up-regulation of EcPIN1a gene in developmental stages signifies its important role in root development in E. coracana.
28439066	Silicon amendment to rice plants impairs sucking behaviors and population growth in the phloem feeder Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2017	Sci Rep	The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is a migratory and destructive sucking insect pest of rice. Silicon (Si) amendment to plants can confer enhanced resistance to herbivores and is emerging as a novel approach for pest management. In the present study, we tested the effects of Si addition at 0.16 (low) and 0.32 (high) g Si/kg soil on sucking behaviors and population growth in BPH. Si amendment increased Si content in rice stems and extended non-probing event and phloem puncture followed by sustained phloem ingestion over that in the no-Si-addition control. High Si addition rate prolonged the stylet pathway and the time needed to reach the first phloem puncture, shortened durations of phloem puncture and phloem ingestion, and decreased the proportion of individuals that produced sustained phloem ingestion. BPH female feeding on and preference for plants with the high Si addition rate were also reduced. As a result, Si application significantly decreased BPH population growth rates while increased population doubling time. These results indicate that Si amendment, especially at the high rate, confers enhanced rice plant resistance to BPH through impairment of BPH feeding. Our results highlight the potential of Si amendment as an alternative for BPH management.
28429576	Suppression of OsMADS7 in rice endosperm stabilizes amylose content under high temperature stress.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	High temperature significantly alters the amylose content of rice, resulting in mature grains with poor eating quality. However, only few genes and/or quantitative trait loci involved in this process have been isolated and the molecular mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. Here, we describe a floral organ identity gene, OsMADS7, involved in stabilizing rice amylose content at high temperature. OsMADS7 is greatly induced by high temperature at the early filling stage. Constitutive suppression of OsMADS7 stabilizes amylose content under high temperature stress but results in low spikelet fertility. However, rice plants with both stable amylose content at high temperature and normal spikelet fertility can be obtained by specifically suppressing OsMADS7 in endosperm. GBSSI is the major enzyme responsible for amylose biosynthesis. A low filling rate and high expression of GBSSI were detected in OsMADS7 RNAi plants at high temperature, which may be correlated with stabilized amylose content in these transgenic seeds under high temperature. Thus, specific suppression of OsMADS7 in endosperm could improve the stability of rice amylose content at high temperature, and such transgenic materials may be a valuable genetic resource for breeding rice with elite thermal resilience.
28429297	Identification of QTLs for yield and agronomic traits in rice under stagnant flooding conditions.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Stagnant flooding, where water of 25-50 cm remains until harvest time, is a major problem in rainfed lowland areas. Most of the Sub1 varieties, which can withstand around 2 weeks of complete submergence, perform poorly in these conditions. Hence, varieties tolerant of stagnant flooding are essential.

RESULTS: This paper presents the first study to map QTLs associated with tolerance to stagnant flooding, along with a parallel study under normal irrigation, using an F7 mapping population consisting of 148 RILs derived from a cross of Ciherang-Sub1 and the stagnant-flooding tolerant line IR10F365. Phenotypic data was collected for 15 key traits under both environments. Additionally, survival rate was measured under stress conditions. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Infinium genotyping platform with a 6 K SNP chip, resulting in 469 polymorphic SNPs. Under stress and irrigated conditions, 38 and 46 QTLs were identified, respectively. Clusters of QTLs were detected in both stress and normal conditions, especially on chromosomes 3 and 5.

CONCLUSIONS: Unique and common QTLs were identified and their physiological consequences are discussed. These beneficial QTLs can be used as targets for molecular breeding and can be further investigated to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in stagnant flooding tolerance in rice.
28420613	Genetic analysis and identification of candidate genes for two spotted-leaf mutants (spl101 and spl102) in rice.	2017	Yi Chuan	Spotted-leaf mutants form spots in leaves or leaf sheaths under normal condition. The spotted-leaf phenotypes are similar to hypersensitive reaction of plants attacked by pathogen. Identification and characterization of the spotted-leaf mutants are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of resistance to plant diseases. Here, we identify two spotted-leaf mutants spl101 and spl102 from an EMS-treated elite japonica cultivar KYJ (Kuanyejing). spl101 and spl102 form serious spots at the late heading stage. Genetic analyses show that the spotted-leaf phenotypes of both spl101 and spl102 are caused by a single recessive mutation, respectively. By employing the Mutmap method, we reveal that both spl101 and spl102 contain mutations in the OsEDR1 gene. The spl101 mutation occurs in the 5°-splicing site of the 6th intron of OsEDR1, which causes abnormal recognition of the 6th intron and leads to the frameshift mutation. The spl102 mutant contains a mutation in the tenth exon of OsEDR1, resulting in an amino acid change from the phenylalanine (F) to the cysteine (C). OsEDR1 has been reported to regulate pathogen-resistant reaction, and loss of OsEDR1 function produces similar phenotypes to those of spl101 and spl102. Here, two newly identified alleles of OsEDR1 will be benefit for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of the OsEDR1 gene in disease resistance, and will be helpful for enriching the rice germplasm resources. In addition, our results also validate the effectiveness of the Mutmap method in cloning the candidate mutations.
28447607	Genome-wide identification, characterization, and expression profile of aquaporin gene family in flax (Linum usitatissimum).	2017	Sci Rep	Membrane intrinsic proteins (MIPs) form transmembrane channels and facilitate transport of myriad substrates across the cell membrane in many organisms. Majority of plant MIPs have water transporting ability and are commonly referred as aquaporins (AQPs). In the present study, we identified aquaporin coding genes in flax by genome-wide analysis, their structure, function and expression pattern by pan-genome exploration. Cross-genera phylogenetic analysis with known aquaporins from rice, arabidopsis, and poplar showed five subgroups of flax aquaporins representing 16 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), 17 tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), 13 NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), 2 small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs), and 3 uncharacterized intrinsic proteins (XIPs). Amongst aquaporins, PIPs contained hydrophilic aromatic arginine (ar/R) selective filter but TIP, NIP, SIP and XIP subfamilies mostly contained hydrophobic ar/R selective filter. Analysis of RNA-seq and microarray data revealed high expression of PIPs in multiple tissues, low expression of NIPs, and seed specific expression of TIP3 in flax. Exploration of aquaporin homologs in three closely related Linum species bienne, grandiflorum and leonii revealed presence of 49, 39 and 19 AQPs, respectively. The genome-wide identification of aquaporins, first in flax, provides insight to elucidate their physiological and developmental roles in flax.
28353179	Genotypic and Environmental Variations in Grain Cadmium and Arsenic Concentrations Among a Panel of High Yielding Rice Cultivars.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice is a major dietary source of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) for populations consuming rice as the staple food. Excessive Cd and As accumulation in rice grain is of great concern worldwide, especially in South China where soil contamination with heavy metals and metalloids is widespread. It is important to reduce Cd and As accumulation in rice grain through selection and breeding of cultivars accumulating low levels of Cd or As.

RESULTS: To assess the genetic and environmental variations in the concentrations of Cd and As in rice grains, 471 locally adapted high-yielding rice cultivars were grown at three moderately contaminated sites in South China for two years. Cadmium and As concentrations in brown rice varied by 10 - 32 and 2.5 - 4 fold, respectively. Genotype (G), environment (E) and G x E interactions were highly significant factors explaining the variations. Brown rice Cd concentration was found to correlate positively with the heading date among different cultivars, whereas As concentration and heading date correlated negatively. There was a significant and negative correlation between grain Cd and As concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS: Eight and 6 rice cultivars were identified as stable low accumulators of Cd and As, respectively, based on the multiple site and season trials. These cultivars are likely to be compliant with the grain Cd or As limits of the Chinese Food Safety Standards when grown in moderately contaminated paddy soils in South China.
28338637	Using an Active-Optical Sensor to Develop an Optimal NDVI Dynamic Model for High-Yield Rice Production (Yangtze, China).	2017	Sensors (Basel)	The successful development of an optimal canopy vegetation index dynamic model for obtaining higher yield can offer a technical approach for real-time and nondestructive diagnosis of rice (Oryza sativa L) growth and nitrogen (N) nutrition status. In this study, multiple rice cultivars and N treatments of experimental plots were carried out to obtain: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), above-ground dry matter (DM), and grain yield (GY) data. The quantitative relationships between NDVI and these growth indices (e.g., LAI, DM and GY) were analyzed, showing positive correlations. Using the normalized modeling method, an appropriate NDVI simulation model of rice was established based on the normalized NDVI (RNDVI) and relative accumulative growing degree days (RAGDD). The NDVI dynamic model for high-yield production in rice can be expressed by a double logistic model: RNDVI = ( 1 + e - 15.2829 × ( R A G D D i - 0.1944 ) ) - 1 - ( 1 + e - 11.6517 × ( R A G D D i - 1.0267 ) ) - 1 (R2 = 0.8577**), which can be used to accurately predict canopy NDVI dynamic changes during the entire growth period. Considering variation among rice cultivars, we constructed two relative NDVI (RNDVI) dynamic models for Japonica and Indica rice types, with R2 reaching 0.8764** and 0.8874**, respectively. Furthermore, independent experimental data were used to validate the RNDVI dynamic models. The results showed that during the entire growth period, the accuracy (k), precision (R2), and standard deviation of RNDVI dynamic models for the Japonica and Indica cultivars were 0.9991, 1.0170; 0.9084**, 0.8030**; and 0.0232, 0.0170, respectively. These results indicated that RNDVI dynamic models could accurately reflect crop growth and predict dynamic changes in high-yield crop populations, providing a rapid approach for monitoring rice growth status.
28337760	Proteomics of contrasting rice genotypes: Identification of potential targets for raising crops for saline environment.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	High salinity is one of the major problems in crop productivity, affecting seed germination as well as yield. In order to enhance tolerance of crops towards salinity, it is essential to understand the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms. In this endeavor, study of contrasting genotypes of the same species differing in their response towards salinity stress can be very useful. In the present study, we have investigated temporal differences in morphological, physiological and proteome profiles of two contrasting genotypes of rice to understand the basis of salt tolerance. When compared to IR64 rice, Pokkali, the salt-tolerant wild genotype, has enhanced capacity to cope with stress, better growth rate and possesses efficient antioxidant system, as well as better photosynthetic machinery. Our proteome studies revealed a higher and an early abundance of proteins involved in stress tolerance and photosynthesis in Pokkali in comparison with IR64, which, in contrast, showed greater changes in metabolic machinery even during early duration of stress. Our findings suggest important differences in physicochemical and proteome profiles of the two genotypes, which may be the basis of observed stress tolerance in the salt-tolerant Pokkali.
28480321	Assembly of genomic reads of elite indica rice cultivar onto 2101 reference bacterial genomes for identification of co-sequenced endophytic bacteria.	2017	Data Brief	Reference based assembly of genomic reads of the elite indica rice cultivar RP Bio-226 was carried out against 2101 reference bacterial genomes using Bowtie-2 genome assembly tool. Five types of data: Number of paired end reads concordantly aligned exactly only once, number of paired end reads concordantly aligned more than once, number of mates that make the pairs aligned exactly only once, number of mates that make the pairs aligned more than once and overall percentage of alignment were collected. Interpretation of the results and identification of endophytes based on these alignment statistics are described in detail in our research article "L.Battu, M.M. Reddy, B.S.Goud, K.Ulaganathan, K.Ulaganathan, Genome inside genome:NGS based identification and assembly of endophytic Sphingopyxis granuli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes from rice genomic reads, Genomics (in press)".
28324683	Thermal stress impacts reproductive development and grain yield in rice.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Rice is highly sensitive to temperature stress (cold and heat), particularly during the reproductive and grain-filling stages. In this review, we discuss the effects of low- and high-temperature sensitivity in rice at various reproductive stages (from meiosis to grain development) and propose strategies for improving the tolerance of rice to terminal thermal stress. Cold stress impacts reproductive development through (i) delayed heading, due to its effect on anther respiration, which increases sucrose accumulation, protein denaturation and asparagine levels, and decreases proline accumulation, (ii) pollen sterility owing to tapetal hypertrophy and related nutrient imbalances, (iii) reduced activity of cell wall bound invertase in the tapetum of rice anthers, (iv) impaired fertilization due to inhibited anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity and ability of the pollen tube to germinate through the style towards the ovary, and (v) floret sterility, which increases grain abortion, restricts grain size, and thus reduces grain yield. Heat stress affects grain formation and development through (i) poor anther dehiscence due to restricted closure of the locules, leading to reduced pollen dispersal and fewer pollen on the stigma, (ii) changes in pollen proteins resulting in significant reductions in pollen viability and pollen tube growth, leading to spikelet sterility, (iii) delay in heading, (iv) reduced starch biosynthesis in developing grain, which reduces starch accumulation, (v) increased chalkiness of grain with irregular and round-shaped starch granules, and (vi) a shortened grain-filling period resulting in low grain weight. However, physiological and biotechnological tools, along with integrated management and adaptation options, as well as conventional breeding, can help to develop new rice genotypes possessing better grain yield under thermal stress during reproductive and grain-filling phases.
28287426	Phosphorus and Iron Deficiencies Influences Rice Shoot Growth in an Oxygen Dependent Manner: Insight from Upland and Lowland Rice.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Rice is the main staple crop for one-third of the world population. To maximize yields, large quantities and constant input of fertilizers containing essential nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) are added. Rice can germinate in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the crosstalk between oxygen (O₂) and nutrients such as P and Fe on plant growth remains obscure. The aim of this work was to test whether such interactions exist, and, if so, if they are conserved between up- and lowland rice varieties. To do so, we assessed shoot and root biomass as well as inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation in four rice varieties, including two lowland rice varieties Nipponbare and Suphanburi 1 (SPR1) (adapted to non-aerated condition) and two upland rice varieties CMU122 and Sew Mae Jun (SMJ) (adapted to aerated condition) under various conditions of Pi and/or Fe deficiencies, in aerated and non-areated solution. Under these different experimental conditions, our results revealed that the altered shoot biomass in Nipponbare and SPR1 was O₂-dependent but to a lesser extent in CMU122 and SMJ cultivars. In this perspective, discovering the biological significance and molecular basis of these mineral elements and O₂ signal interaction is needed to fully appreciate the performance of plants to multiple environmental changes.
28346447	Synthetic control of flowering in rice independent of the cultivation environment.	2017	Nat Plants	For genetically homogeneous crops, the timing of flowering is determined largely by the cultivation environment and is strongly associated with the yield and quality of the harvest1. Flowering time and other agronomical traits are often tightly correlated, which can lead to difficulty excluding the effects of flowering time when evaluating the characteristics of different genetic varieties2. Here, we describe the development of transgenic rice plants whose flowering time can be controlled by specific agrochemicals. We first developed non-flowering rice plants by overexpressing a floral repressor gene, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7)3,4, to inhibit any environmentally induced spontaneous flowering. We then co-transformed plants with a rice florigen gene, Heading date 3a (Hd3a)5, which is induced by the application of specific agrochemicals. This permitted the flowering time to be experimentally controlled regardless of the cultivation environment: some transgenic plants flowered only after agrochemical treatment. Furthermore, plant size and yield-related traits could, in some cases, be increased owing to both a longer duration of vegetative growth and an increased panicle size. This ability to control flowering time experimentally, independently of environmental variables, may lead to production of crops suitable for growth in different climates and facilitate breeding for various agronomical traits.
28321828	Genome-wide Association Analysis Tracks Bacterial Leaf Blight Resistance Loci In Rice Diverse Germplasm.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: A range of resistance loci against different races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the pathogen causing bacterial blight (BB) disease of rice, have been discovered and characterized. Several have been deployed in modern varieties, however, due to rapid evolution of Xoo, a number have already become ineffective. The continuous "arms race" between Xoo and rice makes it imperative to discover new resistance loci to enable durable deployment of multiple resistance genes in modern breeding lines. Rice diversity panels can be exploited as reservoirs of useful genetic variation for bacterial blight (BB) resistance. This study was conducted to identify loci associated to BB resistance, new genetic donors and useful molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding.

RESULTS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BB resistance using a diverse panel of 285 rice accessions was performed to identify loci that are associated with resistance to nine Xoo strains from the Philippines, representative of eight global races. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differential resistance were identified in the diverse panel and a subset of 198 indica accessions. Strong associations were found for novel SNPs linked with known bacterial blight resistance Xa genes, from which high utility markers for tracking and selection of resistance genes in breeding programs were designed. Furthermore, significant associations of SNPs in chromosomes 6, 9, 11, and 12 did not overlap with known resistance loci and hence might prove to be novel sources of resistance. Detailed analysis revealed haplotypes that correlated with resistance and analysis of putative resistance alleles identified resistant genotypes as potential donors of new resistance genes.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of the GWAS validated known genes underlying resistance and identified novel loci that provide useful targets for further investigation. SNP markers and genetic donors identified in this study will help plant breeders in improving and diversifying resistance to BB.
28074633	A computational interactome for prioritizing genes associated with complex agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important staple foods for more than half of the global population. Many rice traits are quantitative, complex and controlled by multiple interacting genes. Thus, a full understanding of genetic relationships will be critical to systematically identify genes controlling agronomic traits. We developed a genome-wide rice protein-protein interaction network (RicePPINet, http://netbio.sjtu.edu.cn/riceppinet) using machine learning with structural relationship and functional information. RicePPINet contained 708 819 predicted interactions for 16 895 non-transposable element related proteins. The power of the network for discovering novel protein interactions was demonstrated through comparison with other publicly available protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction methods, and by experimentally determined PPI data sets. Furthermore, global analysis of domain-mediated interactions revealed RicePPINet accurately reflects PPIs at the domain level. Our studies showed the efficiency of the RicePPINet-based method in prioritizing candidate genes involved in complex agronomic traits, such as disease resistance and drought tolerance, was approximately 2-11 times better than random prediction. RicePPINet provides an expanded landscape of computational interactome for the genetic dissection of agronomically important traits in rice.
28461719	Exogenous application of rutin and gallic acid regulate antioxidants and alleviate reactive oxygen generation in <i>Oryza sativa</i> L.	2017	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	The effect of rutin and gallic acid on growth, phytochemical and defense gene activation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was investigated. The seeds of rice were primed with different concentrations of rutin and gallic acid (10-60 µg mL-1) to explicate the effect on germination on water agar plates. Further, to study the effect of most effective concentrations of gallic acid (60 µg mL-1) and rutin (50 µg mL-1), greenhouse pot experiment was set up to determine the changes in growth, antioxidant and defense parameters. The results revealed more pronounced effect of gallic acid on total chlorophyll and carotenoids as well as on total flavonoid content and free radical scavenging activities. Gene expression analysis of OsWRKY71, PAL, CHS and LOX genes involved in strengthening the plant defense further validated the results obtained from the biochemical analysis. Microscopic analysis also confirmed reduction in total reactive oxygen species, free radicals like H2O2 and O2- by exogenous application of gallic acid and rutin. The data obtained thus suggest that both gallic acid and rutin can affect the growth and physiology of rice plants and therefore can be used to develop effective plant growth promoters and as substitute of biofertilizers for maximizing their use in field conditions.
28369461	Updated foxtail millet genome assembly and gene mapping of nine key agronomic traits by resequencing a RIL population.	2017	Gigascience	Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) provides food and fodder in semi-arid regions and infertile land. Resequencing of 184 foxtail millet recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was carried out to aid essential research on foxtail millet improvement. A total 483 414 single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined. Bin maps were constructed based on the RILs' recombination data. Based on the high-density bin map, we updated Zhanggu reference with 416 Mb after adding 16 Mb unanchored scaffolds and Yugu reference with some assembly error correction and 3158 gaps filled. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of nine agronomic traits was done based on this RIL population, five of which were controlled by a single gene. Meanwhile, two QTLs were found for plant height, and a candidate gene showed 89% identity to the known rice gibberellin-synthesis gene sd1. Three QTLs were found for the trait of heading date. The whole genome resequencing and QTL mapping provided important tools for foxtail millet research and breeding. Resequencing of the RILs could also provide an effective way for high-quality genome assembly and gene identification.
28241800	The essence of NAC gene family to the cultivation of drought-resistant soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) cultivars.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The NAC gene family is notable due to its large size, as well as its relevance in crop cultivation - particularly in terms of enhancing stress tolerance of plants. These plant-specific proteins contain NAC domain(s) that are named after Petunia NAM and Arabidopsis ATAF1/2 and CUC2 transcription factors based on the consensus sequence they have. Despite the knowledge available regarding NAC protein function, an extensive study on the possible use of GmNACs in developing soybean cultivars with superior drought tolerance is yet to be done.

RESULTS: In response to this, our study was carried out, mainly through means of phylogenetic analysis (rice and Arabidopsis NAC genes served as seeding sequences). Through this, 139 GmNAC genes were identified and later grouped into 17 clusters. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on drought-stressed and unstressed leaf tissues of both sensitive (B217 and H228) and tolerant (Jindou 74 and 78) cultivars. This was done to analyze the gene expression of 28 dehydration-responsive GmNAC genes. Upon completing the analysis, it was found that GmNAC gene expression is actually dependent on genotype. Eight of the 28 selected genes (GmNAC004, GmNAC021, GmNAC065, GmNAC066, GmNAC073, GmNAC082, GmNAC083 and GmNAC087) were discovered to have high expression levels in the drought-resistant soybean varieties tested. This holds true for both extreme and standard drought conditions. Alternatively, the drought-sensitive cultivars exhibited lower GmNAC expression levels in comparison to their tolerant counterparts.

CONCLUSION: The study allowed for the identification of eight GmNAC genes that could be focused upon in future attempts to develop superior soybean varieties, particularly in terms of drought resistance. This study revealed that there were more dehydration-responsive GmNAC genes as (GmNAC004, GmNAC005, GmNAC020 and GmNAC021) in addition to what were reported in earlier inquiries. It is important to note though, that discovering such notable genes is not the only goal of the study. It managed to put emphasis on the significance of further understanding the potential of soybean GmNAC genes, for the purpose of enhancing tolerance towards abiotic stress in general. This scientific inquiry has also revealed that cultivar genotypes tend to differ in their drought-induced gene expression.
28168408	SSR-enriched genetic linkage maps of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × transvaalensis), and their comparison with allied plant genomes.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We report SSR-enriched genetic maps of bermudagrass that: (1) reveal partial residual polysomic inheritance in the tetraploid species, and (2) provide insights into the evolution of chloridoid genomes. This study describes genetic linkage maps of two bermudagrass species, Cynodon dactylon (T89) and Cynodon transvaalensis (T574), that integrate heterologous microsatellite markers from sugarcane into frameworks built with single-dose restriction fragments (SDRFs). A maximum likelihood approach was used to construct two separate parental maps from a population of 110 F1 progeny of a cross between the two parents. The T89 map is based on 291 loci on 34 cosegregating groups (CGs), with an average marker spacing of 12.5 cM. The T574 map is based on 125 loci on 14 CGs, with an average marker spacing of 10.7 cM. Six T89 and one T574 CG(s) deviated from disomic inheritance. Furthermore, marker segregation data and linkage phase analysis revealed partial residual polysomic inheritance in T89, suggesting that common bermudagrass is undergoing diploidization following whole genome duplication (WGD). Twenty-six T89 CGs were coalesced into 9 homo(eo)logous linkage groups (LGs), while 12 T574 CGs were assembled into 9 LGs, both putatively representing the basic chromosome complement (x = 9) of the species. Eight T89 and two T574 CGs remain unassigned. The marker composition of bermudagrass ancestral chromosomes was inferred by aligning T89 and T574 homologs, and used in comparisons to sorghum and rice genome sequences based on 108 and 91 significant blast hits, respectively. Two nested chromosome fusions (NCFs) shared by two other chloridoids (i.e., zoysiagrass and finger millet) and at least three independent translocation events were evident during chromosome number reduction from 14 in the polyploid common ancestor of Poaceae to 9 in Cynodon.
28388358	Physicochemical properties of giant embryo rice Seonong 17 and Keunnunjami.	2017	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	This study was carried out to determine the physicochemical properties of giant embryo rice "Seonong 17" and "Keunnunjami" in comparison with the normal embryo rice. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Seonong 17 and Keunnunjami have larger embryo and that starch granules from Keunnunjami were more tightly packed with smaller air spaces between granules. Seonong 17 exhibited the lowest amylose content. Keunnunjami showed the highest protein content, pasting temperature, peak and breakdown viscosities, and gelatinization temperature and enthalpy. Both giant embryo rice samples contained significantly higher amounts of essential amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids than the normal rice. Proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed differences in the protein profile of Seonong 17 and Keunnunjami. The results could serve as baseline information in evaluating the quality of these two giant embryo rice cultivars and provide a better understanding of their potential uses and food industry applications.
28069894	Genetics, Physiological Mechanisms and Breeding of Flood-Tolerant Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Flooding of rice fields is a serious problem in the river basins of South and South-East Asia where about 15 Mha of lowland rice cultivation is regularly affected. Flooding creates hypoxic conditions resulting in poor germination and seedling establishment. Flash flooding, where rice plants are completely submerged for 10-15 d during their vegetative stage, causes huge losses. Water stagnation for weeks to months also leads to substantial yield losses when large parts of rice aerial tissues are inundated. The low-yielding traditional varieties and landraces of rice adapted to these flooding conditions have been replaced by flood-sensitive high-yielding rice varieties. The 'FR13A' rice variety and the Submergence 1A (SUB1A) gene were identified for flash flooding and subsequently introgressed to high-yielding rice varieties. The challenge is to find superior alleles of the SUB1A gene, or even new genes that may confer greater tolerance to submergence. Similarly, genes have been identified in tolerant landraces of rice for their ability to survive by rapid stem elongation (SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2) during deep-water flooding, and for anaerobic germination ability (TPP7). Research on rice genotypes and novel genes that are tolerant to prolonged water stagnation is in progress. These studies will greatly assist in devising more efficient and precise molecular breeding strategies for developing climate-resilient high-yielding rice varieties for flood-prone regions. Here we review the state of our knowledge of flooding tolerance in rice and its application in varietal improvement.
28099032	Pathogenicity Genes in Ustilaginoidea virens Revealed by a Predicted Protein-Protein Interaction Network.	2017	J Proteome Res	Rice false smut, caused by Ustilaginoidea virens, produces significant losses in rice yield and grain quality and has recently emerged as one of the most important rice diseases worldwide. Despite its importance in rice production, relatively few studies have been conducted to illustrate the complex interactome and the pathogenicity gene interactions. Here a protein-protein interaction network of U. virens was built through two well-recognized approaches, interolog- and domain-domain interaction-based methods. A total of 20 217 interactions associated with 3305 proteins were predicted after strict filtering. The reliability of the network was assessed computationally and experimentally. The topology of the interactome network revealed highly connected proteins. A pathogenicity-related subnetwork involving up-regulated genes during early U. virens infection was also constructed, and many novel pathogenicity proteins were predicted in the subnetwork. In addition, we built an interspecies PPI network between U. virens and Oryza sativa, providing new insights for molecular interactions of this host-pathogen pathosystem. A web-based publicly available interactive database based on these interaction networks has also been released. In summary, a proteome-scale map of the PPI network was described for U. virens, which will provide new perspectives for finely dissecting interactions of genes related to its pathogenicity.
28214729	Improved tolerance to transplanting injury and chilling stress in rice seedlings treated with orysastrobin.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	In addition to their fungicidal activity, strobilurin-type fungicides are reported to show enhancing effects on crop growth and yield. Previous studies suggested that the fungicide has a mitigating effect on abiotic stresses. However, there are few reports about growth enhancement through abiotic stress alleviation by strobilurin-type fungicides, but the mechanism of action of the growth enhancement is still not clear. The present study revealed that orysastrobin enhanced rice seedling growth after root cutting injury and chilling stress. We also found that orysastrobin decreased the transpiration rate and increased ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities. This stress alleviation was eliminated by the application of naproxen, a putative abscisic acid biosynthesis inhibitor. These results suggested that orysastrobin improved tolerance against transplanting injury and chilling stress in rice seedlings by inducing water-retaining activity through the suppression of transpiration, and also by inducing reactive oxygen scavenging activity thus inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation.
28238052	Estimation of loci involved in non-shattering of seeds in early rice domestication.	2017	Genetica	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is widely cultivated around the world and is known to be domesticated from its wild form, O. rufipogon. A loss of seed shattering is one of the most obvious phenotypic changes selected for during rice domestication. Previously, three seed-shattering loci, qSH1, sh4, and qSH3 were reported to be involved in non-shattering of seeds of Japonica-type cultivated rice, O. sativa cv. Nipponbare. In this study, we focused on non-shattering characteristics of O. sativa Indica cv. IR36 having functional allele at qSH1. We produced backcross recombinant inbred lines having chromosomal segments from IR36 in the genetic background of wild rice, O. rufipogon W630. Histological and quantitative trait loci analyses of abscission layer formation were conducted. In the analysis of quantitative trait loci, a strong peak was observed close to sh4. We, nevertheless, found that some lines showed complete abscission layer formation despite carrying the IR36 allele at sh4, implying that non-shattering of seeds of IR36 could be regulated by the combination of mutations at sh4 and other seed-shattering loci. We also genotyped qSH3, a recently identified seed-shattering locus. Lines that have the IR36 alleles at sh4 and qSH3 showed inhibition of abscission layer formation but the degree of seed shattering was different from that of IR36. On the basis of these results, we estimated that non-shattering of seeds in early rice domestication involved mutations in at least three loci, and these genetic materials produced in this study may help to identify novel seed-shattering loci.
28192179	Genome inside genome: NGS based identification and assembly of endophytic Sphingopyxis granuli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes from rice genomic reads.	2017	Genomics	The interactions between crop plants and the endophytic bacteria colonizing them are poorly understood and experimental methods were found to be inadequate to meet the complexities associated with the interaction. Moreover, research on endophytic bacteria was focused at host plant species level and not at cultivar level which is essential for understanding the role played by them on the productivity of specific crop genotype. High throughput genomics offers valuable tools for identification, characterization of endophytic bacteria and understand their interaction with host plants. In this paper we report the use of high throughput plant genomic data for identification of endophytic bacteria colonizing rice plants. Using this novel next generation sequencing based computational method Sphingopyxis granuli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as endophytes colonizing the elite indica rice cultivar RP Bio-226 and their draft genome sequences were assembled.
15599031	[Physiological and genetic analysis of lesion resembling disease mutants (lrd) of Oryza sativa L].	2004	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	Ten indica rice and eight japonica rice mutants with lesion resembling disease (lrd27-44) were obtained by gamma-ray mutagenesis of the whole genomes. These mutants exhibited diverse lesion mimic phenotypes under different growth environments, could be accordingly classified two types, sensitive and insensitive to environments. Basing on difference in development of lesion mimics, they can be divided into three categories: whole life lesion mimics (WLLM), vegetative initiation lesion mimics (VILM), and reproductive initiation lesion mimics (RILM). Lesion mimics resulted from the programmed cell death and were triggered by light, but not by wounding. The genetic analysis showed that four mutants, lrd32, lrd39, lrd40 and lrd42, were controlled by one or two recessive loci. Among the 18 lrd mutants, lrd37 and lrd40 conferred non-race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Gene mapping and cloning of Lrd32 and Lrd40 are under way.
16105854	Overexpression in transgenic tobacco reveals different roles for the rice homeodomain gene OsBIHD1 in biotic and abiotic stress responses.	2005	J Exp Bot	The rice OsBIHD1 gene encodes a transcriptional factor belonging to the homeodomain class. It had previously been shown to be activated by treatment with benzothiadiazole, a chemical inducer of disease resistance, and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus. To allow a better understanding of the function of OsBIHD1 in plant disease resistance response, the OsBIHD1 gene in tobacco was overexpressed by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the OsBIHD1 ORF under control of the 35S promoter. Overexpression of the rice OsBIHD1 gene in some of the transgenic tobacco lines led to some morphological abnormalities in the top buds and roots. The transgenic tobacco plants showed an elevated level of defence-related PR-1 gene expression and enhanced disease resistance against infection by tomato mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. However, the transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsBIHD1 showed enhanced sensitivity to salt and oxidative stress as compared with the wild-type plants. The results suggested that the OsBIHD1 protein may be positively involved in activating expression of the defence-related genes in disease resistance responses, and is also important in rice development and abiotic stress tolerance.
20565634	Characterization of four rice mutants with alterations in the defence response pathway.	2005	Mol Plant Pathol	SUMMARY A fast-neutron mutagenized population of rice seedlings was screened with Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, to identify mutants with alterations in the defence response. Three mutant lines, ebr1, ebr2 and ebr3 (enhanced blast resistance) were identified that display enhanced resistance to M. grisea. ebr1 and ebr3 also confer enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). ebr3 develops a lesion mimic (LM) phenotype upon inoculation with M. grisea, and the phenotype is also induced by a shift in environmental conditions. The fourth mutant line, ncr1 (necrosis in rice), has an LM phenotype under all conditions tested and lacks enhanced resistance to either M. grisea or Xoo. Complementation testing using the mutant lines ebr3 and ncr1 indicates that the ebr3 and ncr1 loci are nonallelic and recessive. ebr1 and ebr2 display no alterations in expression of the rice pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PBZ1 and PR1, compared to wild-type CO39. ebr3 has an elevated expression of PBZ1 and PR1 only in tissue displaying the LM phenotype. ncr1 strongly expresses PBZ1 in tissue displaying the LM phenotype, whereas PR1 expression in this tissue is similar to wild-type CO39.
19766710	Genome-scale screening and molecular characterization of membrane-bound transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice.	2010	Genomics	Controlled proteolytic activation of membrane-bound transcription factors (MTFs) is recently emerging as a versatile way of rapid transcriptional responses to environmental changes in plants. Here, we report genome-scale identification of putative MTFs in the Arabidopsis and rice genomes. The Arabidopsis and rice genomes have at least 85 and 45 MTFs, respectively, in virtually all major transcription factor families. Of particular interest is the NAC MTFs (designated NTLs): there are at least 18 NTLs in Arabidopsis and 5 NTL members (OsNTLs) in rice. While the full-size OsNTL forms are associated with the membranes, truncated forms lacking the transmembrane domains are detected exclusively in the nucleus. Furthermore, transcript levels of the OsNTL genes were elevated after treatments with abiotic stresses, supporting their roles in plant stress responses. We propose that membrane-mediated transcriptional control is a critical component of gene regulatory network that serves as an adaptive strategy under unfavorable growth conditions.
28578018	Rice gene SDL/RNRS1, encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, is required for chlorophyll synthesis and plant growth development.	2017	Gene	A new mutant named sdl (stripe and drooping leaf) was characterized from indica cultivar Zhenong 34 by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The mutant sdl exhibited development defects including stripe and drooping leaf, dwarfism and deformed floral organs. The gene SDL was found allelic to RNRS1 by map-based cloning, which was homologous to Arabidopsis TSO2 encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. The gDNA sequencing results of sdl in mutant showed that there was a repetitive sequence insertion of 138-bp at the 475th bp in the exon. The redundant sequence was conserved in SDL homologous proteins, which contained the active site (tyrosine), as well as two amino acids glutamate and histidine involved in the binding of iron. There were fewer chloroplasts and grana lamellas in sdl leaf compared with those of wild-type. Additionally, the stripe leaves of sdl seedlings were highly sensitive to temperature, since the chlorophyll content was increased with the temperature rising. The drooping leaf of sdl might be resulted from the disappearance of vascular bundles and mesophyll cells in both leaf midrib and lateral veins. Fittingly to the phenotypes of mutant sdl, the expression levels of genes associated with photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis were found to be down- or up-regulated at different temperatures in mutant sdl. Also, the transcriptional levels of genes related to plant height and floral organ formation showed obvious differences between wild-type and sdl. The "SDL/RNRS1" was, hence, required for the chlorophyll biosynthesis and also played pleiotropic roles in the regulation of plant development.
28487409	Rice Homeodomain Protein WOX11 Recruits a Histone Acetyltransferase Complex to Establish Programs of Cell Proliferation of Crown Root Meristem.	2017	Plant Cell	Shoot-borne crown roots are the major root system in cereals. Previous work has shown that the Wuschel-related homeobox gene WOX11 is necessary and sufficient to promote rice (Oryza sativa) crown root emergence and elongation. Here, we show that WOX11 recruits the ADA2-GCN5 histone acetyltransferase module to activate downstream target genes in crown root meristem. Rice ADA2 and GCN5 genes are highly expressed in root meristem and are shown to be essential for cell division and growth. WOX11 and ADA2-GCN5 commonly target and regulate a set of root-specific genes involved in energy metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and hormone response, some of which are known to be important for root development. The results indicate that the recruitment of ADA2-GCN5 by WOX11 establishes gene expression programs of crown root meristem cell division and suggest that permissive chromatin modification involving histone acetylation is a strategy for WOX11 to stimulate root meristem development.
28559349	Dating rice remains through phytolith carbon-14 study reveals domestication at the beginning of the Holocene.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytolith remains of rice (Oryza sativa L.) recovered from the Shangshan site in the Lower Yangtze of China have previously been recognized as the earliest examples of rice cultivation. However, because of the poor preservation of macroplant fossils, many radiocarbon dates were derived from undifferentiated organic materials in pottery sherds. These materials remain a source of debate because of potential contamination by old carbon. Direct dating of the rice remains might serve to clarify their age. Here, we first validate the reliability of phytolith dating in the study region through a comparison with dates obtained from other material from the same layer or context. Our phytolith data indicate that rice remains retrieved from early stages of the Shangshan and Hehuashan sites have ages of approximately 9,400 and 9,000 calibrated years before the present, respectively. The morphology of rice bulliform phytoliths indicates they are closer to modern domesticated species than to wild species, suggesting that rice domestication may have begun at Shangshan during the beginning of the Holocene.
28465411	Ethylene-Inhibited Jasmonic Acid Biosynthesis Promotes Mesocotyl/Coleoptile Elongation of Etiolated Rice Seedlings.	2017	Plant Cell	Elongation of the mesocotyl and coleoptile facilitates the emergence of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings from soil and is affected by various genetic and environment factors. The regulatory mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. Here, we examined the regulation of mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by characterizing a gaoyao1 (gy1) mutant that exhibits a longer mesocotyl and longer coleoptile than its original variety of rice. GY1 was identified through map-based cloning and encodes a PLA1-type phospholipase that localizes in chloroplasts. GY1 functions at the initial step of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to repress mesocotyl and coleoptile elongation in etiolated rice seedlings. Ethylene inhibits the expression of GY1 and other genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway to reduce JA levels and enhance mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by promoting cell elongation. Genetically, GY1 acts downstream of the OsEIN2-mediated ethylene signaling pathway to regulate mesocotyl/coleoptile growth. Through analysis of the resequencing data from 3000 rice accessions, we identified a single natural variation of the GY1 gene, GY1376T , which contributes to mesocotyl elongation in rice varieties. Our study reveals novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of mesocotyl/coleoptile elongation and should have practical applications in rice breeding programs.
28514448	uORF-mediated translation allows engineered plant disease resistance without fitness costs.	2017	Nature	Controlling plant disease has been a struggle for humankind since the advent of agriculture. Studies of plant immune mechanisms have led to strategies of engineering resistant crops through ectopic transcription of plants' own defence genes, such as the master immune regulatory gene NPR1 (ref. 1). However, enhanced resistance obtained through such strategies is often associated with substantial penalties to fitness, making the resulting products undesirable for agricultural applications. To remedy this problem, we sought more stringent mechanisms of expressing defence proteins. On the basis of our latest finding that translation of key immune regulators, such as TBF1 (ref. 3), is rapidly and transiently induced upon pathogen challenge (see accompanying paper), we developed a 'TBF1-cassette' consisting of not only the immune-inducible promoter but also two pathogen-responsive upstream open reading frames (uORFsTBF1) of the TBF1 gene. Here we demonstrate that inclusion of uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control over the production of snc1-1 (an autoactivated immune receptor) in Arabidopsis thaliana and AtNPR1 in rice enables us to engineer broad-spectrum disease resistance without compromising plant fitness in the laboratory or in the field. This broadly applicable strategy may lead to decreased pesticide use and reduce the selective pressure for resistant pathogens.
28575747	Reactive oxygen species induced by heat stress during grain filling of rice (Oryza sativa L.) are involved in occurrence of grain chalkiness.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Heat stress during grain filling increases rice grain chalkiness due to increased activity of α-amylase, which hydrolyzes starch. In rice and barley seeds, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced after imbibition induce α-amylase activity via regulation of gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) levels during seed germination. Here, we examined whether ROS is involved in induction of grain chalkiness by α-amylase in developing rice grains under heat stress. To elucidate the role of ROS in grain chalkiness, we grew post-anthesis rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Koshihikari) under control (25°C) or heat stress (30°C) conditions with or without antioxidant (dithiothreitol) treatment. The developing grains were analyzed for expression of NADPH oxidases, GA biosynthesis genes (OsGA3ox1, OsGA20ox1), ABA catabolism genes (OsABA8'OH1, OsABA8'OH2) and an α-amylase gene (OsAmy3E), endogenous H2O2 content and the grain quality. In grains exposed to heat stress, the expression of NADPH oxidase genes (especially, OsRbohB, OsRbohD, OsRbohF and OsRbohI) and the ROS content increased. Heat stress also increased the expression of OsGA3ox1, OsGA20ox1, OsABA8'OH1, OsABA8'OH2 and OsAmy3E. On the other hand, dithiothreitol treatment reduced the effects of heat stress on the expression of these genes and significantly reduced grain chalkiness induced by heat stress. These results suggest that, similar to cereal seed germination mechanism, ROS produced under heat stress is involved in α-amylase induction in maturating rice grains through GA/ABA metabolism, and consequently caused grain chalkiness.
28716414	Functional characterization of the SbNrat1 gene in sorghum.	2017	Plant Sci	The Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) members play diverse roles in metal transport in plants. Recent studies have showed that OsNrat1 (OsNramp4) encodes an Al transporter, which is required for rice Al tolerance. In this study, we functionally characterized a Nramp member in sorghum, SbNrat1, which is homologous to OsNrat1 with 88% identity. SbNrat1 was expressed in both roots and shoots, and its expression was not induced by Al treatment. When expressed in yeast, SbNrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not Mn and Cd. Furthermore, introduction of SbNrat1 into the rice mutant osnrat1 can rescue its sensitivity to Al. However, no correlation between Al tolerance and the expression level of SbNrat1 was found in thirteen sorghum cultivars tested. These results indicate that SbNrat1 functions as an Al transporter that is possibly involved in basic Al tolerance in sorghum.
28527335	Dissection of cis-regulatory element architecture of the rice oleosin gene promoters to assess abscisic acid responsiveness in suspension-cultured rice cells.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Oleosins are the most abundant proteins in the monolipid layer surrounding neutral storage lipids that form oil bodies in plants. Several lines of evidence indicate that they are physiologically important for the maintenance of oil body structure and for mobilization of the lipids stored inside. Rice has six oleosin genes in its genome, the expression of all of which was found to be responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) in our examination of mature embryo and aleurone tissues. The 5'-flanking region of OsOle5 was initially characterized for its responsiveness to ABA through a transient expression assay system using the protoplasts from suspension-cultured rice cells. A series of successive deletions and site-directed mutations identified five regions critical for the hormonal induction of its promoter activity. A search for cis-acting elements in these regions deposited in a public database revealed that they contain various promoter elements previously reported to be involved in the ABA response of various genes. A gain-of-function experiment indicated that multiple copies of all five regions were sufficient to provide the minimal promoter with a distinct ABA responsiveness. Comparative sequence analysis of the short, but still ABA-responsive, promoters of OsOle genes revealed no common modular architecture shared by them, indicating that various distinct promoter elements and independent trans-acting factors are involved in the ABA responsiveness of rice oleosin multigenes.
28495893	Rice Sucrose Partitioning Mediated by a Putative Pectin Methyltransferase and Homogalacturonan Methylesterification.	2017	Plant Physiol	Homogalacturonan (HG) is the main component of pectins. HG methylesterification has recently emerged as a key determinant controlling cell attachment, organ formation, and phyllotaxy. However, whether and how HG methylesterification affects intercellular metabolite transport has rarely been reported. Here, we identified and characterized knockout mutants of the rice (Oryza sativa) OsQUA2 gene encoding a putative pectin methyltransferase. Osqua2 mutants exhibit a remarkable decrease in the degree of methylesterification of HG in the culm-sieve element cell wall and a markedly reduced grain yield. The culm of Osqua2 mutant plants contains excessive sucrose (Suc), and a 13CO2 feeding experiment showed that the Suc overaccumulation in the culm was caused by blocked Suc translocation. These and other findings demonstrate that OsQUA2 is essential for maintaining a high degree of methylesterification of HG in the rice culm-sieve element cell wall, which may be critical for efficient Suc partitioning and grain filling. In addition, our results suggest that the apoplastic pathway is involved in long-distance Suc transport in rice. The identification and characterization of the OsQUA2 gene and its functionality revealed a previously unknown contribution of HG methylesterification and provided insight into how modification of the cell wall regulates intercellular transport in plants.
28527337	Improved stress tolerance and productivity in transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Oryza sativa glutathione synthetase OsGS under paddy field conditions.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Reactive oxygen species, which increase under various environmental stresses, have deleterious effects on plants. An important antioxidant, glutathione, is used to detoxify reactive oxygen species in plant cells and is mainly produced by two enzymes: gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) and glutathione synthetase (GS). To evaluate the functional roles of the glutathione synthetase gene (OsGS) in rice, we generated four independent transgenic rice plants (TG1-TG4) that overexpressed OsGS under the control of the constitutively expressed OsCc1 promoter. When grown under natural paddy field conditions, the TG rice plants exhibited greater growth development, higher chlorophyll content, and higher GSH/GSSH ratios than control wild-type (WT) rice plants. Subsequently, the TG rice plants enhanced redox homeostasis by preventing hydroperoxide-mediated membrane damage, which improved their adaptation to environmental stresses. As a result, TG rice plants improved rice grain yield and total biomass following increases in panicle number and number of spikelets per panicle, despite differences in climate during the cultivation periods of 2014 and 2015. Overall, our results indicate that OsGS overexpression improved redox homeostasis by enhancing the glutathione pool, which resulted in greater tolerance to environmental stresses in the paddy fields.
28531235	RNA-Seq analysis of gene expression for floral development in crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L.).	2017	PLoS One	Crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum L. (Gaertn.)] is widely used for early spring grazing in western Canada and the development of late maturing cultivars which maintain forage quality for a longer period is desired. However, it is difficult to manipulate the timing of floral transition, as little is known about molecular mechanism of plant maturity in this species. In this study, RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analysis were performed to investigate gene expression for floral initiation and development in crested wheatgrass. Three cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced to represent three successive growth stages by sampling leaves at the stem elongation stage, spikes at boot and anthesis stages. The sequencing generated 25,568,846; 25,144,688 and 25,714,194 qualified Illumina reads for the three successive stages, respectively. De novo assembly of all the reads generated 311,671 transcripts with a mean length of 487 bp, and 152,849 genes with an average sequence length of 669 bp. A total of 48,574 (31.8%) and 105,222 (68.8%) genes were annotated in the Swiss-Prot and NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein databases, respectively. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway database, 9,723 annotated sequences were mapped onto 298 pathways, including plant circadian clock pathway. Specifically, 113 flowering time-associated genes, 123 MADS-box genes and 22 CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) genes were identified. A COL homolog DN52048-c0-g4 which was clustered with the flowering time genes AtCO and OsHd1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.), respectively, showed specific expression in leaves and could be a CONSTANS (CO) candidate gene. Taken together, this study has generated a new set of genomic resources for identifying and characterizing genes and pathways involved in floral transition and development in crested wheatgrass. These findings are significant for further understanding of the molecular basis for late maturity in this grass species.
28589142	Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing Reveals Spontaneous Single-Nucleotide Mutations in Rice <i>OsMsh6</i> Mutants.	2017	Biomed Res Int	Genomic stability depends in part on an efficient DNA lesion recognition and correction by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. We investigated mutations arising spontaneously in rice OsMsh6 mutants by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing. Totally 994 single-nucleotide mutations were identified in three mutants and on average the mutation density is about 1/136.72 Kb per mutant line. These mutations were relatively randomly distributed in genome and might be accumulated in generation-dependent manner. All possible base transitions and base transversions could be seen and the ratio of transitions to transversions was about 3.12. We also observed the nearest-neighbor bias around the mutated base. Our data suggests that OsMsh6 (LOC_Os09g24220) is important in ensuring genome stability by recognizing mismatches that arise spontaneously and provides useful information for investigating the function of the OsMsh6 gene in DNA repair and exploiting MMR mutants in rice induced mutation breeding.
28500268	A Rice NAC Transcription Factor Promotes Leaf Senescence via ABA Biosynthesis.	2017	Plant Physiol	It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence and premature leaf senescence negatively affect the yield of rice (Oryza sativa). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this relationship, especially the upstream transcriptional network that modulates ABA level during leaf senescence, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a rice NAC transcription factor, OsNAC2, that participates in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of OsNAC2 dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, dual-luciferase, and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAC2 directly activates expression of chlorophyll degradation genes, OsSGR and OsNYC3 Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly up-regulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as down-regulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1). Interestingly, OsNAC2 is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of OsNAC2 by ABA. Additionally, reduced OsNAC2 expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines. The novel ABA-NAC-SAGs regulatory module might provide a new insight into the molecular action of ABA to enhance leaf senescence and elucidates the transcriptional network of ABA production during leaf senescence in rice.
28340032	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a major dietary source of arsenic (As) for the population consuming rice as their staple food. Rice grain contains both inorganic As and methylated As species, especially dimethyarsinate (DMA). DMA is highly mobile in long-distance translocation in plants, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we showed that OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a putative peptide transporter in rice, was permeable to DMA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transient expression of the OsPTR7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco protoplasts showed that OsPTR7 was localized in the cell plasma membrane. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that OsPTR7 was more highly expressed in the shoots than in the roots at the seedling stage. At the flowering and grain-filling stage, the OsPTR7 transcript was abundant in the leaves, node I and roots. Knockout or knockdown mutants of OsPTR7 had significantly decreased root to shoot translocation of DMA compared with wild-type plants and accumulated less As in the brown rice. In field-grown plants, DMA accounted for 35% of the total As in the brown rice of wild-type plants but was undetectable in the knockout mutant. Our study demonstrates that OsPTR7 is involved in the long-distance translocation of DMA and contributes to the accumulation of DMA in rice grain.
28204489	Enzymatic properties of a GH19 chitinase isolated from rice lacking a major loop structure involved in chitin binding.	2017	Glycobiology	The catalytic domains of family GH19 chitinases have been found to consist of a conserved, α-helical core-region and different numbers (1-6) of loop structures, located at both ends of the substrate-binding groove and which extend over the glycon- and aglycon-binding sites. We expressed, purified and enzymatically characterized a GH19 chitinase from rice, Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare (OsChia2a), lacking a major loop structure (loop III) connected to the functionally important β-stranded region. The new enzyme thus contained the five remaining loop structures (loops I, II, IV, V and C-term). The OsChia2a recombinant protein catalyzed hydrolysis of chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n (n = 3-6), with inversion of anomeric configuration, indicating that OsChia2a correctly folded without loop III. From thermal unfolding experiments and calorimetric titrations using the inactive OsChia2a mutant (OsChia2a-E68Q), in which the catalytic residue Glu68 was mutated to glutamine, we found that the binding affinities towards (GlcNAc)n (n = 2-6) were almost proportional to the degree of polymerization of (GlcNAc)n, but were much lower than those obtained for a moss GH19 chitinase having only loop III [Ohnuma T, Sørlie M, Fukuda T, Kawamoto N, Taira T, Fukamizo T. 2011. Chitin oligosaccharide binding to a family GH19 chitinase from the moss, Bryum coronatum. FEBS J. 278:3991-4001]. Nevertheless, OsChia2a exhibited significant antifungal activity. It appears that loop III connected to the β-stranded region is important for (GlcNAc)n binding, but is not essential for antifungal activity.
28330558	Altered expression of polyamine transporters reveals a role for spermidine in the timing of flowering and other developmental response pathways.	2017	Plant Sci	Changes in the levels of polyamines are correlated with the activation or repression of developmental response pathways, but the role of polyamine transporters in the regulation of polyamine homeostasis and thus indirectly gene expression, has not been previously addressed. Here we show that the A. thaliana and rice transporters AtPUT5 and OsPUT1 were localized to the ER, while the AtPUT2, AtPUT3, and OsPUT3 were localized to the chloroplast by transient expression in N. benthamiana. A. thaliana plants that were transformed with OsPUT1 under the control the PUT5 promoter were delayed in flowering by 16days. In contrast, put5 mutants flowered four days earlier than WT plants. The delay of flowering was associated with significantly higher levels of spermidine and spermidine conjugates in the leaves prior to flowering. A similar delay in flowering was also noted in transgenic lines with constitutive expression of either OsPUT1 or OsPUT3. All three transgenic lines had larger rosette leaves, thicker flowering stems, and produced more siliques than wild type plants. In contrast, put5 plants had smaller leaves, thinner flowering stems, and produced fewer siliques. Constitutive expression of PUTs was also associated with an extreme delay in both plant senescence and maturation rate of siliques. These experiments provide the first genetic evidence of polyamine transport in the timing of flowering, and indicate the importance of polyamine transporters in the regulation of flowering and senescence pathways.
28611803	Shading Contributes to the Reduction of Stem Mechanical Strength by Decreasing Cell Wall Synthesis in Japonica Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Low solar radiation caused by industrial development and solar dimming has become a limitation in crop production in China. It is widely accepted that low solar radiation influences many aspects of plant development, including slender, weak stems and susceptibility to lodging. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To clarify how low solar radiation affects stem mechanical strength formation and lodging resistance, the japonica rice cultivars Wuyunjing23 (lodging-resistant) and W3668 (lodging-susceptible) were grown under field conditions with normal light (Control) and shading (the incident light was reduced by 60%) with a black nylon net. The yield and yield components, plant morphological characteristics, the stem mechanical strength, cell wall components, culm microstructure, gene expression correlated with cellulose and lignin biosynthesis were measured. The results showed that shading significantly reduced grain yield attributed to reduction of spikelets per panicles and grain weight. The stem-breaking strength decreased significantly under shading treatment; consequently, resulting in higher lodging index in rice plant in both varieties, as revealed by decreased by culm diameter, culm wall thickness and increased plant height, gravity center height. Compared with control, cell wall components including non-structural carbohydrate, sucrose, cellulose, and lignin reduced quite higher. With histochemical straining, shading largely reduced lignin deposition in the sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundle cells compared with control, and decreased cellulose deposition in the parenchyma cells of culm tissue in both Wuyunjing23 and W3668. And under shading condition, gene expression involved in secondary cell wall synthesis, OsPAL, OsCOMT, OsCCoAOMT, OsCCR, and OsCAD2, and primary cell wall synthesis, OsCesA1, OsCesA3, and OsCesA8 were decreased significantly. These results suggest that gene expression involved in the reduction of lignin and cellulose in both sclerenchyma and parenchyma cells, which attribute to lignin and cellulose in culm tissue and weak mechanical tissue, consequently, result in poor stem strength and higher lodging risks. Highlights: (1) Shading decreases the stem mechanical strength of japonica rice by decreasing non-structural carbohydrate, sucrose, lignin, and cellulose accumulation in culms. (2) The decrease of carbon source under shading condition is the cause for the lower lignin and cellulose accumulation in culm. (3) The expression of genes involved in lignin and primarily cell wall cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA1, OsCesA3, and OsCesA8) at the stem formation stage are down-regulated under shading condition, inducing defective cell wall development and poor lodging resistance.
28371895	OsPAP26 Encodes a Major Purple Acid Phosphatase and Regulates Phosphate Remobilization in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	During phosphate (Pi) starvation or leaf senescence, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) increases in plants in order to scavenge organic phosphorus (P). In this study, we demonstrated that a PAP-encoding gene in rice, OsPAP26, is constitutively expressed in all tissues. While the abundance of OsPAP26 transcript is not affected by Pi supply, it is up-regulated during leaf senescence. Furthermore, Pi deprivation and leaf senescence greatly increased the abundance of OsPAP26 protein. Overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) of OsPAP26 in transgenic rice significantly increased or reduced APase activities, respectively, in leaves, roots and growth medium. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, Pi concentrations of OsPAP26-overexpressing plants increased in the non-senescing leaves and decreased in the senescing leaves. The increased remobilization of Pi from the senescing leaves to non-senescing leaves in the OsPAP26-overexpressing plants resulted in better growth performance when plants were grown in Pi-depleted condition. In contrast, OsPAP26-RNAi plants retained more Pi in the senescing leaves, and were more sensitive to Pi starvation stress. OsPAP26 was found to localize to the apoplast of rice cells. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from callus growth medium confirmed that OsPAP26 is a secreted PAP. OsPAP26-overexpressing plants were capable of converting more ATP into inorganic Pi in the growth medium, which further supported the potential role of OsPAP26 in utilizing organic P in the rhizosphere. In summary, we concluded that OsPAP26 performs dual functions in plants: Pi remobilization from senescing to non-senescing leaves; and organic P utilization.
28620402	The <i>xantha</i> Marker Trait Is Associated with Altered Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis and Deregulated Transcription of PhANGs in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	The xantha marker trait, which is controlled by a down-regulating epi-mutation of OsGUN4, has been applied to the production of hybrid rice. However, the molecular basis for the ability of xantha mutants to attain high photosynthetic capacity even with decreased chlorophyll contents has not been characterized. In the present study, we observed that the total chlorophyll content of the xantha mutant was only 27.2% of that of the wild-type (WT) plants. However, the xantha mutant still accumulated 59.9% of the WT δ-aminolevulinic acid content, 72.8% of the WT Mg-protoporphyrin IX content, and 63.0% of the WT protochlorophyllide a content. Additionally, the protoporphyrin IX and heme contents in the mutant increased to 155.0 and 160.0%, respectively, of the WT levels. A search for homologs resulted in the identification of 124 rice genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and photosynthesis. With the exception of OsGUN4, OsHO-1, and OsHO-2, the expression levels of the genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis were significantly higher in the xantha mutant than in the WT plants, as were all 72 photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes. In contrast, there were no differences between the xantha mutant and WT plants regarding the expression of all 22 photosynthesis-associated chloroplast genes. Furthermore, the abundance of 1O2 and the expression levels of 1O2-related genes were lower in the xantha mutant than in the WT plants, indicating 1O2-mediated retrograde signaling was repressed in the mutant plants. These results suggested that the abundance of protoporphyrin IX used for chlorophyll synthesis decreased in the mutant, which ultimately decreased the amount of chlorophyll in the xantha mutant. Additionally, the up-regulated expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes enabled the mutant to attain a high photosynthetic capacity. Our findings confirm that OsGUN4 plays an important role in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and photosynthesis in rice. GUN4, chlorophyll synthesis pathways, and photosynthetic activities are highly conserved in plants and hence, novel traits (e.g., xantha marker trait) may be generated in other cereal crops by modifying the GUN4 gene.
28559550	Metabolic and transcriptional alternations for defense by interfering OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 transcriptions in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to dissect the enhanced disease resistance in the plants harbouring a RNA interfering construct of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 (dsOW62/76) genes. The primary metabolic pathways were activated in dsOW62/76 compared with wild-type (ZH17) plants, revealed by increased accumulation of amino acids and constituents of citric acid cycle etc. Contents of phenolic acids derived from phenylpropanoid pathway were elevated in dsOW62/76 plants. Importantly, phenolamides, conjugates of the phenolic acids with amines, were detected in large number and mostly at higher levels in dsOW62/76 compared with ZH17 plants; however, the free pools of flavonoids were mostly decreased in dsOW62/76. Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)/JA-Ile contents were increased in dsOW62/76 and knockout lines of individual OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 genes. Transcription of isochorismate synthase (OsICS1) gene was suppressed in dsOW62/76 and in MeJA-treated rice plants, whereas the transcription level of cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-dehydrogenase (OsCHD) gene for β-oxidation in peroxisome was increased. The calli with OsCHD mutation showed markedly decreased SA accumulation. These results indicate that OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76 function as negative regulators of biosynthetic defense-related metabolites and provide evidence for an important role of phenylpropanoid pathway in SA production in rice.
28502056	Overexpression of the nitrate transporter, OsNRT2.3b, improves rice phosphorus uptake and translocation.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Overexpression of OsNRT2.3b in rice can increase Pi uptake and accumulation through advanced root system, enhanced OsPT and OsPHR genes expression, and the phloem pH homeostasis. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two essential macronutrients for plants. Overexpression of the rice nitrate transporter, OsNRT2.3b, can improve rice grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Here, OsNRT2.3b overexpression resulted in increased grain yield, straw yield, and grain:straw ratio, accompanied by increased P concentrations in the leaf blade, leaf sheath, culm, and unfilled rice hulls. Overexpression of OsNRT2.3b significantly increased 33Pi uptake compared with WT under 300-μM Pi but not 10-μM Pi condition in 24 h. Moreover, the OsNRT2.3b-overexpressing rice lines showed increased root and shoot biomass, root:shoot ratio, total root length root surface area and N, P accumulation under 300- and 10-μM Pi supply in hydroponic solution. The levels of OsPT2, OsPT8, and OsPHR2 expression in roots and of OsPT1 and OsPHR2 in shoots were upregulated in OsNRT2.3b-overexpressing rice. These results indicated that OsNRT2.3b overexpression can improve rice P uptake and accumulation, partially through the advanced root system, enhanced gene expression, and the phloem pH regulation function.
28505352	The Nodulin 26-like intrinsic membrane protein OsNIP3;2 is involved in arsenite uptake by lateral roots in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Previous studies have shown that the Nodulin 26-like intrinsic membrane protein (NIP) Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1) is involved in arsenite [As(III)] uptake in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the role of other rice NIPs in As(III) accumulation in planta remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role OsNIP3;2 in As(III) uptake in rice. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OsNIP3;2 showed a high transport activity for As(III). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of OsNIP3;2 was suppressed by 5 µM As(III), but enhanced by 20 and 100 µM As(III). Transgenic rice plants expressing OsNIP3;2pro-GUS showed that the gene was predominantly expressed in the lateral roots and the stele region of the primary roots. Transient expression of OsNIP3;2:GFP fusion protein in rice protoplasts showed that the protein was localized in the plasma membrane. Knockout of OsNIP3;2 significantly decreased As concentration in the roots, but had little effect on shoot As concentration. Synchrotron microfocus X-ray fluorescence showed decreased As accumulation in the stele of the lateral roots in the mutants compared with wild-type. Our results indicate that OsNIP3;2 is involved in As(III) uptake by lateral roots, but its contribution to As accumulation in the shoots is limited.
28472292	Calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK10 mediates both drought tolerance and blast disease resistance in rice plants.	2017	J Exp Bot	Plant growth and productivity is negatively affected by different stresses. Most stresses trigger calcium signals that initiate acclimation responses in plants. The multigene family of plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) functions in multiple stress responses by transducing calcium signals into phosphorylation events. This work reports that the OsCPK10 isoform positively mediates tolerance to different stresses in rice plants by enhancing their antioxidant capacity and protecting them from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, with the uncontrolled generation of ROS being a common feature of these stresses. Here, we show that the constitutive accumulation of an HA-tagged OsCPK10 full-length protein enhances the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity of rice plants during desiccation. This is achived by modulating the accumulation of catalase proteins, which reduces the extent of lipid peroxidation and protects the integrity of cell membranes, resulting in drought tolerance. OsCPK10HA accumulation also confers blast disease resistance by interfering with fungal necrotrophic growth via a reduction in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we show by bimolecular complementation assays that OsCPK10 is a plasma membrane protein that physically interacts in vivo with catalase A. OsCPK10 therefore appears to be a good molecular target to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as to blast disease, which limit rice crop productivity.
28576844	The Sequences of 1504 Mutants in the Model Rice Variety Kitaake Facilitate Rapid Functional Genomic Studies.	2017	Plant Cell	The availability of a whole-genome sequenced mutant population and the cataloging of mutations of each line at a single-nucleotide resolution facilitate functional genomic analysis. To this end, we generated and sequenced a fast-neutron-induced mutant population in the model rice cultivar Kitaake (Oryza sativa ssp japonica), which completes its life cycle in 9 weeks. We sequenced 1504 mutant lines at 45-fold coverage and identified 91,513 mutations affecting 32,307 genes, i.e., 58% of all rice genes. We detected an average of 61 mutations per line. Mutation types include single-base substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, and tandem duplications. We observed a high proportion of loss-of-function mutations. We identified an inversion affecting a single gene as the causative mutation for the short-grain phenotype in one mutant line. This result reveals the usefulness of the resource for efficient, cost-effective identification of genes conferring specific phenotypes. To facilitate public access to this genetic resource, we established an open access database called KitBase that provides access to sequence data and seed stocks. This population complements other available mutant collections and gene-editing technologies. This work demonstrates how inexpensive next-generation sequencing can be applied to generate a high-density catalog of mutations.
28177831	Rapid identification of a new gene influencing low amylose content in rice landraces (Oryza sativa L.) using genome-wide association study with specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing.	2017	Genome	Starch is the major component of milled rice, and amylose content (AC) affects eating quality. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) data was performed for AC on a core collection of 419 rice landraces. Using the compressed mixed linear method based on the Q+K model, we identified a new gene, LAC6 (Chr6: 5.65-6.04 Mb), associated with AC in the low amylose content panel. The LAC6 candidate gene was detected by qRT-PCR in rice panicles. Results indicate that LOC_Os06g11130 was up-regulated, and LOC_Os06g11340 was significantly down-regulated, making it most likely a key candidate gene of LAC6. In conclusion, the findings provide a certain theoretiacal basis of molecular biology for genetic improvement of AC in rice and rice quality variety breeding.
28607067	A recruiting protein of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase controls metabolic flux toward chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In plants, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is produced by plastidic GGPP synthase (GGPPS) and serves as a precursor for vital metabolic branches, including chlorophyll, carotenoid, and gibberellin biosynthesis. However, molecular mechanisms regulating GGPP allocation among these biosynthetic pathways localized in the same subcellular compartment are largely unknown. We found that rice contains only one functionally active GGPPS, OsGGPPS1, in chloroplasts. A functionally active homodimeric enzyme composed of two OsGGPPS1 subunits is located in the stroma. In thylakoid membranes, however, the GGPPS activity resides in a heterodimeric enzyme composed of one OsGGPPS1 subunit and GGPPS recruiting protein (OsGRP). OsGRP is structurally most similar to members of the geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit type II subfamily. In contrast to members of this subfamily, OsGRP enhances OsGGPPS1 catalytic efficiency and specificity of GGPP production on interaction with OsGGPPS1. Structural biology and protein interaction analyses demonstrate that affinity between OsGRP and OsGGPPS1 is stronger than between two OsGGPPS1 molecules in homodimers. OsGRP determines OsGGPPS1 suborganellar localization and directs it to a large protein complex in thylakoid membranes, consisting of geranylgeranyl reductase (OsGGR), light-harvesting-like protein 3 (OsLIL3), protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (OsPORB), and chlorophyll synthase (OsCHLG). Taken together, genetic and biochemical analyses suggest OsGRP functions in recruiting OsGGPPS1 from the stroma toward thylakoid membranes, thus providing a mechanism to control GGPP flux toward chlorophyll biosynthesis.
28626465	Altered Expression of OsNLA1 Modulates Pi Accumulation in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) Plants.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Current agricultural practices rely on heavy use of fertilizers for increased crop productivity. However, the problems associated with heavy fertilizer use, such as high cost and environmental pollution, require the development of crop species with increased nutrient use efficiency. In this study, by using transgenic approaches, we have revealed the critical role of OsNLA1 in phosphate (Pi) accumulation of rice plants. When grown under sufficient Pi and nitrate levels, OsNLA1 knockdown (Osnla1-1, Osnla1-2, and Osnla1-3) lines accumulated higher Pi content in their shoot tissues compared to wild-type, whereas, over-expression lines (OsNLA1-OE1, OsNLA1-OE2, and OsNLA1-OE3) accumulated the least levels of Pi. However, under high Pi levels, knockdown lines accumulated much higher Pi content compared to wild-type and exhibited Pi toxicity symptoms in the leaves. In contrast, the over-expression lines had 50-60% of the Pi content of wild-type and did not show such symptoms. When grown under limiting nitrate levels, OsNLA1 transgenic lines also displayed a similar pattern in Pi accumulation and Pi toxicity symptoms compared to wild-type suggesting an existence of cross-talk between nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), which is regulated by OsNLA1. The greater Pi accumulation in knockdown lines was a result of enhanced Pi uptake/permeability of roots compared to the wild-type. The cross-talk between N and P was found to be nitrate specific since the knockdown lines failed to over-accumulate Pi under low (sub-optimal) ammonium level. Moreover, OsNLA1 was also found to interact with OsPHO2, a known regulator of Pi homeostasis, in a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay. Taken together, these results show that OsNLA1 is involved in Pi homeostasis regulating Pi uptake and accumulation in rice plants and may provide an opportunity to enhance P use efficiency by manipulating nitrate supply in the soil.
28702040	Abscisic Acid Regulates Auxin Homeostasis in Rice Root Tips to Promote Root Hair Elongation.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential role in root hair elongation in plants, but the regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that exogenous ABA can promote rice root hair elongation. Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module. Treatment of the DR5-GUS and OsPIN-GUS lines with ABA and an auxin efflux inhibitor showed that ABA-induced root hair elongation depends on polar auxin transport. To examine the transcriptional response to ABA, we divided rice root tips into three regions: short root hair, long root hair and root tip zones; and conducted RNA-seq analysis with or without ABA treatment. Examination of genes involved in auxin transport, biosynthesis and metabolism indicated that ABA promotes auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in the root tip, which may lead to auxin accumulation in the long root hair zone. Our findings shed light on how ABA regulates root hair elongation through crosstalk with auxin biosynthesis and transport to orchestrate plant development.
28659944	OsSAPK2 Confers Abscisic Acid Sensitivity and Tolerance to Drought Stress in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	SNF 1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2) is a family of plant-specific protein kinases which is the key regulator of hyper-osmotic stress signaling and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent development in various plants. Among the rice subclass-I and -II SnRK2s, osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2) may be the primary mediator of ABA signaling. However, SAPK2 has not been comprehensively characterized. In this study, we elucidated the functional properties of SAPK2 using loss-of-function mutants produced with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The SAPK2 expression level was strongly upregulated by drought, high-salinity, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments. The sapk2 mutants exhibited an ABA-insensitive phenotype during the germination and post-germination stages, suggesting that SAPK2 had a pivotal role related to ABA-mediated seed dormancy. The sapk2 mutants were more sensitive to drought stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the wild-type plants, indicating that SAPK2 was important for responses to drought conditions in rice. An additional investigation revealed that SAPK2 increased drought tolerance in the following two ways: (i) by reducing water loss via the accumulation of compatible solutes, promoting stomatal closure, and upregulating the expression levels of stress-response genes such as OsRab16b, OsRab21, OsbZIP23, OsLEA3, OsOREB1 and slow anion channel (SLAC)-associated genes such as OsSLAC1 and OsSLAC7; (ii) by inducing the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes to promote ROS-scavenging abilities that will ultimately decrease ROS damages. Moreover, we also observed that SAPK2 significantly increased the tolerance of rice plants to salt and PEG stresses. These findings imply that SAPK2 is a potential candidate gene for future crop improvement studies.
28647924	Comparative Expression Analysis of Rice and Arabidopsis Peroxiredoxin Genes Suggests Conserved or Diversified Roles Between the Two Species and Leads to the Identification of Tandemly Duplicated Rice Peroxiredoxin Genes Differentially Expressed in Seeds.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) have recently been identified as plant antioxidants. Completion of various genome sequencing projects has provided genome-wide information about PRX genes in major plant species. Two of these -- Oryza sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis -- each have 10 PRX members. Although significant progress has been made in understanding their biological roles in Arabidopsis, those functions in rice, a model crop plant, have not been well studied.

RESULTS: We performed a comparative expression analysis of rice and Arabidopsis PRXs. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that one subgroup contains three rice and three Arabidopsis Type-II PRXs that are expressed ubiquitously. This suggests that they are involved in housekeeping functions to process reactive oxygen species (ROS). Within the second subgroup, expression of Os1-CysPrxA (LOC_Os7g44430) and AtOs1-CysPrx is conserved in seeds while Os1-CysPrxB (LOC_Os7g44440) shows a root-preferential pattern of expression. We used transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter gene under the control of the promoters of these two tandem duplicates to confirm their meta-expression patterns. Our GUS expression data from developing seeds and those that were germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone layer. For the third and fourth subgroups, the rice PRXs are more likely to show leaf/shoot-preferential expression, while those from Arabidopsis are significantly expressed in the flowers and seeds in addition to the leaf/shoot. To determine the biological meaning of those expression patterns that were dominantly identified in rice PRXs, we analyzed three rice genes showing leaf/shoot-preferential expression in a mutant of the light-responsive 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (dxr) gene and found that two of them were significantly down-regulated in the mutant.

CONCLUSION: A global expression analysis of the PRX family in rice identified tandem duplicates, Os1-CysPrxA and Os1-CysPrxB, in the 1-CysPrx subgroup that are differentially expressed in developing seeds and germinating seeds. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) revealed unique CREs responsible for embryo and root or endosperm-preferential expression. In addition, the presence of leaf/shoot-preferential PRXs in rice suggests that they are required in that crop because those plants must tolerate a higher light intensity in their normal growth environment when compared with that of Arabidopsis. Downregulation of two PRXs in the dxr mutant causing an albino phenotype, implying that those genes have roles in processing ROS produced during photosynthesis. Network analysis of four PRXs allowed us to model regulatory pathways that explain the underlying protein interaction network. This will be a useful hypothetical model for further study.
28574161	OsIDD2, a zinc finger and INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein, regulates secondary cell wall formation.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Previously, we found 123 transcription factors (TFs) as candidate regulators of secondary cell wall (SCW) formation in rice by using phylogenetic and co-expression network analyses. Among them, we examined in this work the role of OsIDD2, a zinc finger and indeterminate domain (IDD) family TF. Its overexpressors showed dwarfism, fragile leaves, and decreased lignin content, which are typical phenotypes of plants defective in SCW formation, whereas its knockout plants showed slightly increased lignin content. The RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed that some lignin biosynthetic genes were downregulated in the OsIDD2-overexpressing plants, and revealed the same case for other genes involved in cellulose synthesis and sucrose metabolism. The transient expression assay using rice protoplasts revealed that OsIDD2 negatively regulates the transcription of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 2 and 3 (CAD2 and 3), and sucrose metabolism, sucrose synthase 5 (SUS5), whereas an AlphaScreen assay, which can detect the interaction between TFs and their target DNA sequences, directly confirmed the interaction between OsIDD2 and the target sequences located in the promoter regions of CAD2 and CAD3. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsIDD2 is negatively involved in SCW formation and other biological events by downregulating its target genes.
28637831	OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation.	2017	Plant Physiol	Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can absorb only the inorganic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (organic and inorganic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, OsHAD1 While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of organic and inorganic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of OsHAD1 in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of organic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.
28626008	A Dual Role for the OsK5.2 Ion Channel in Stomatal Movements and K<sup>+</sup> Loading into Xylem Sap.	2017	Plant Physiol	The roles of potassium channels from the Shaker family in stomatal movements have been investigated by reverse genetics analyses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but corresponding information is lacking outside this model species. Rice (Oryza sativa) and other cereals possess stomata that are more complex than those of Arabidopsis. We examined the role of the outward Shaker K+ channel gene OsK5.2. Expression of the OsK5.2 gene (GUS reporter strategy) was observed in the whole stomatal complex (guard cells and subsidiary cells), root vasculature, and root cortex. In stomata, loss of OsK5.2 functional expression resulted in lack of time-dependent outward potassium currents in guard cells, higher rates of water loss through transpiration, and severe slowdown of stomatal closure. In line with the expression of OsK5.2 in the plant vasculature, mutant plants displayed a reduced K+ translocation from the root system toward the leaves via the xylem. The comparison between rice and Arabidopsis show that despite the strong conservation of Shaker family in plants, substantial differences can exist between the physiological roles of seemingly orthologous genes, as xylem loading depends on SKOR and stomatal closure on GORK in Arabidopsis, whereas both functions are executed by the single OsK5.2 Shaker in rice.
28680425	OsBSK1-2, an Orthologous of AtBSK1, Is Involved in Rice Immunity.	2017	Front Plant Sci	The brassinosteroid-SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) belongs to the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase XII subgroup. BSK1 regulates development and immunity in Arabidopsis. However, the function of rice (Oryza sativa) BSK1 is largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression level of OsBSK1-2 is induced after a chitin or fagellin22 (flg22) treatment. Silencing OsBSK1-2 in rice results in compromised responses to chitin- or flg22-triggered immunity and resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but does not alter the plant's architecture nor reduce plant responses to brassinosteroid signaling. Our study reveals that OsBSK1-2 functions as a major regulator in rice plant immunity.
28631167	Copper and ectopic expression of the Arabidopsis transport protein COPT1 alter iron homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: Copper deficiency and excess differentially affect iron homeostasis in rice and overexpression of the Arabidopsis high-affinity copper transporter COPT1 slightly increases endogenous iron concentration in rice grains. Higher plants have developed sophisticated mechanisms to efficiently acquire and use micronutrients such as copper and iron. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between both metals remain poorly understood. In the present work, we study the effects produced on iron homeostasis by a wide range of copper concentrations in the growth media and by altered copper transport in Oryza sativa plants. Gene expression profiles in rice seedlings grown under copper excess show an altered expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis compared to standard control conditions. Thus, ferritin OsFER2 and ferredoxin OsFd1 mRNAs are down-regulated whereas the transcriptional iron regulator OsIRO2 and the nicotianamine synthase OsNAS2 mRNAs rise under copper excess. As expected, the expression of OsCOPT1, which encodes a high-affinity copper transport protein, as well as other copper-deficiency markers are down-regulated by copper. Furthermore, we show that Arabidopsis COPT1 overexpression (C1 OE ) in rice causes root shortening in high copper conditions and under iron deficiency. C1 OE rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling. Importantly, the C1 OE rice plants grown on soil contain higher endogenous iron concentration than wild-type plants in both brown and white grains. Collectively, these results highlight the effects of rice copper status on iron homeostasis, which should be considered to obtain crops with optimized nutrient concentrations in edible parts.
28649255	Overexpression of the <i>PeaT1</i> Elicitor Gene from <i>Alternaria tenuissima</i> Improves Drought Tolerance in Rice Plants <i>via</i> Interaction with a Myo-Inositol Oxygenase.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Abiotic stresses, especially drought, seriously threaten cereal crops yields and quality. In this study, we observed that the rice plants of overexpression the Alternariatenuissima PeaT1 gene showed enhanced drought stress tolerance and increased the survival rate following a drought treatment. In PeaT1-overexpressing (PeaT1OE) plants, abscisic acid and chlorophyll content significantly increased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased compared with the wild-type plants. Additionally, we confirmed that the transcript levels of drought-responsive genes, including OsAM1, OsLP2, and OsDST, were prominently lower in the PeaT1OE plants. In contrast, expression levels of genes encoding positive drought stress regulators including OsSKIPa, OsCPK9, OsNAC9, OSEREBP1, and OsTPKb were upregulated in PeaT1OE plants. Furthermore, combing the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that PeaT1 could interact with amyo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX), which was verified by pull-down assay. Interestingly, OsMIOX was highly expressed in PeaT1OE plants during the drought treatment. Additionally, the OsMIOX-GFP fusion protein co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker in tobacco protoplasts, suggesting OsMIOX performs its function in ER. Therefore, our results are useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the improvement of drought tolerance by PeaT1.
28474399	l-cysteine desulfhydrase-related H<sub>2</sub> S production is involved in OsSE5-promoted ammonium tolerance in roots of Oryza sativa.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Previous studies revealed that rice heme oxygenase PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (OsSE5) is involved in the regulation of tolerance to excess ammonium by enhancing antioxidant defence. In this study, the relationship between OsSE5 and hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), a well-known signalling molecule, was investigated. Results showed that NH4 Cl triggered the induction of l-cysteine desulfhydrase (l-DES)-related H2 S production in rice seedling roots. A H2 S donor not only alleviated the excess ammonium-triggered inhibition of root growth but also reduced endogenous ammonium, both of which were aggravated by hypotaurine (HT, a H2 S scavenger) or dl-propargylglycine (PAG, a l-DES inhibitor). Nitrogen metabolism-related enzymes were activated by H2 S, thus resulting in the induction of amino acid synthesis and total nitrogen content. Interestingly, the activity of l-DES, as well as the enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, was significantly increased in the OsSE5-overexpression line (35S:OsSE5), whereas it impaired in the OsSE5-knockdown mutant (OsSE5-RNAi). The application of the HT/PAG or H2 S donor could differentially block or rescue NH4 Cl-hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity phenotypes in 35S:OsSE5-1 or OsSE5-RNAi-1 plants, with a concomitant modulation of nitrogen assimilation. Taken together, these results illustrated that H2 S function as an indispensable positive regulator participated in OsSE5-promoted ammonium tolerance, in which nitrogen metabolism was facilitated.
28574641	Ectopic expression of a novel OsExtensin-like gene consistently enhances plant lodging resistance by regulating cell elongation and cell wall thickening in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Plant lodging resistance is an important integrative agronomic trait of grain yield and quality in crops. Although extensin proteins are tightly associated with plant cell growth and cell wall construction, little has yet been reported about their impacts on plant lodging resistance. In this study, we isolated a novel extensin-like (OsEXTL) gene in rice, and selected transgenic rice plants that expressed OsEXTL under driven with two distinct promoters. Despite different OsEXTL expression levels, two-promoter-driven OsEXTL-transgenic plants, compared to a rice cultivar and an empty vector, exhibited significantly reduced cell elongation in stem internodes, leading to relatively shorter plant heights by 7%-10%. Meanwhile, the OsEXTL-transgenic plants showed remarkably thickened secondary cell walls with higher cellulose levels in the mature plants, resulting in significantly increased detectable mechanical strength (extension and pushing forces) in the mature transgenic plants. Due to reduced plant height and increased plant mechanical strength, the OsEXTL-transgenic plants were detected with largely enhanced lodging resistances in 3 years field experiments, compared to those of the rice cultivar ZH11. In addition, despite relatively short plant heights, the OsEXTL-transgenic plants maintain normal grain yields and biomass production, owing to their increased cellulose levels and thickened cell walls. Hence, this study demonstrates a largely improved lodging resistance in the OsEXTL-transgenic rice plants, and provides insights into novel extensin functions in plant cell growth and development, cell wall network construction and wall structural remodelling.
28694815	Co-overexpression of the Constitutively Active Form of OsbZIP46 and ABA-Activated Protein Kinase SAPK6 Improves Drought and Temperature Stress Resistance in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses threatening rice (Oryza sativa) production worldwide. Drought resistance is controlled by multiple genes, and therefore, a multi-gene genetic engineering strategy is theoretically useful for improving drought resistance. However, the experimental evidence for such a strategy is still lacking. In this study, a few drought-responsive genes from rice were assembled by a multiple-round site-specific assembly system, and the constructs were introduced into the rice cultivar KY131 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic lines of the multi-gene and corresponding single-gene constructs were pre-evaluated for drought resistance. We found that the co-overexpression of two genes, encoding a constitutively active form of a bZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP46CA1) and a protein kinase (SAPK6) involved in the abscisic acid signaling pathway, showed significantly enhanced drought resistance compared with the single-gene transgenic lines and the negative transgenic plants. Single-copy lines of this bi-gene combination (named XL22) and the corresponding single-gene lines were further evaluated for drought resistance in the field using agronomical traits. The results showed that XL22 exhibited greater yield, biomass, spikelet number, and grain number under moderate drought stress conditions. The seedling survival rate of XL22 and the single-gene overexpressors after drought stress treatment also supported the drought resistance results. Furthermore, expression profiling by RNA-Seq revealed that many genes involved in the stress response were specifically up-regulated in the drought-treated XL22 lines and some of the stress-related genes activated in CA1-OE and SAPK6-OE were distinct, which could partially explain the different performances of these lines with respect to drought resistance. In addition, the XL22 seedlings showed improved tolerance to heat and cold stresses. Our results demonstrate that the multi-gene assembly in an appropriate combination may be a promising approach in the genetic improvement of drought resistance.
28585692	OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and required for embryo dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm development.	2017	New Phytol	Rice fertility is critical for rice reproduction and is thus a focus of interest. Most studies have addressed male sterility and its relation to rice production. The mechanisms of regulation of embryogenesis and endosperm development are essential for rice reproduction, but remain largely unknown. Here, we report a functional analysis of the rice gene OsGCD1, which encodes a highly conserved homolog of Arabidopsis GCD1 (GAMETE CELLS DEFECTIVE1). OsGCD1 mutants were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and subjected to functional analysis. The homozygote mutants cannot be obtained, whereas heterozygotes showed altered phenotypes. In the majority of aborted seeds, the endosperm nucleus divided a limited number of times. The free nuclei were distributed only at the micropylar end of embryo sacs, and their oriented positioning was blocked. In addition, aleurone differentiation was interrupted. The embryo developed slowly, and pattern formation, particularly the dorsal-ventral pattern and symmetry establishment, of embryos was disturbed. Thus, the embryos showed various morphological and structural dysplasias. Our findings reveal that OsGCD1 is essential for rice fertility and is required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation and endosperm free nucleus positioning, suggesting a critical role in sexual reproduction of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants.
28631168	The function of OsbHLH068 is partially redundant with its homolog, AtbHLH112, in the regulation of the salt stress response but has opposite functions to control flowering in Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: The homologous genes OsbHLH068 and AtbHLH112 have partially redundant functions in the regulation of the salt stress response but opposite functions to control flowering in Arabidopsis. The transcription factor (TF) basic/Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) is important for plant growth, development, and stress responses. OsbHLH068, which is a homologous gene of AtbHLH112 that is up-regulated under drought and salt stresses, as indicated by previous microarray data analysis. However, the intrinsic function of OsbHLH068 remains unknown. In the present study, we characterized the function and compared the role of OsbHLH068 with that of its homolog, AtbHLH112. Histochemical GUS staining indicated that OsbHLH068 and AtbHLH112 share a similar expression pattern in transgenic Arabidopsis during the juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Heterologous overexpression of OsbHLH068 in Arabidopsis delays seed germination, decreases salt-induced H2O2 accumulation, and promotes root elongation, whereas AtbHLH112 knock-out mutant displays an opposite phenotype. Both OsbHLH068-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings and the Atbhlh112 mutant display a late-flowering phenotype. Moreover, the expression of OsbHLH068-GFP driven by an AtbHLH112 promoter can compensate for the germination deficiency in the Atbhlh112 mutant, but the delayed-flowering phenotype tends to be more severe. Further analysis by microarray and qPCR indicated that the expression of FT is down-regulated in both OsbHLH068-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants and Atbhlh112 mutant plants, whereas SOC1 but not FT is highly expressed in AtbHLH112-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. A comparative transcriptomic analysis also showed that several stress-responsive genes, such as AtERF15 and AtPUB23, were affected in both OsbHLH068- and AtbHLH112-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Thus, we propose that OsbHLH068 and AtbHLH112 share partially redundant functions in the regulation of abiotic stress responses but have opposite functions to control flowering in Arabidopsis, presumably due to the evolutionary functional divergence of homolog-encoded proteins.
28676446	Identification and expression profiling of Oryza sativa nucleotidyl transferase protein (NTP) genes under various stress conditions.	2017	Gene	Nucleotidyl transferase proteins (NTPs) modify the 3' ends of mature small RNAs, leading to their stabilization or degradation. The first two plant NTPs, HESO1 and URT1, were identified in Arabidopsis. These two NTPs act cooperatively to uridylate the 3' terminal nucleotide of specific miRNAs, leading to their degradation and thereby affecting the expression of genes regulated by these miRNAs. Little is known about NTPs in other plants. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 13 putative NTP genes in Oryza sativa, a major crop in global food production. Phylogenetic analysis showed homology among the NTPs from diverse plant species. Analysis of cis-acting promoter elements at OsNTP loci identified several stress response elements, indicating the potential involvement of NTPs in plant stress responses. The promoter analysis results were validated by expression of the OsNTP genes under abiotic stress treatments, with some OsNTPs clearly induced by salt, drought or cold stress. Moreover, the RT-PCR data showed that the OsNTP genes were differentially expressed in different developmental stages and tissues. These findings suggest that NTPs, which are involved in small RNA metabolic pathways, might play roles in plant stress resistance.
28696221	Meiotic Chromosome Association 1 Interacts with TOP3α and Regulates Meiotic Recombination in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	Homologous recombination plays a central role in guaranteeing chromosome segregation during meiosis. The precise regulation of the resolution of recombination intermediates is critical for the success of meiosis. Many proteins, including the RECQ DNA helicases (Sgs1/BLM) and Topoisomerase 3α (TOP3α), have essential functions in managing recombination intermediates. However, many other factors involved in this process remain to be defined. Here, we report the isolation of meiotic chromosome association 1 (MEICA1), a novel protein participating in meiotic recombination in rice (Oryza sativa). Loss of MEICA1 leads to nonhomologous chromosome association, the formation of massive chromosome bridges, and fragmentation. MEICA1 interacts with MSH7, suggesting its role in preventing nonallelic recombination. In addition, MEICA1 has an anticrossover activity revealed by suppressing the defects of crossover formation in msh5 meica1 compared with that in msh5, showing the similar function with its interacted protein TOP3α. Thus, our data establish two pivotal roles for MEICA1 in meiosis: preventing aberrant meiotic recombination and regulating crossover formation.
28700950	Transcriptional changes of rice in response to rice black-streaked dwarf virus.	2017	Gene	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae, causes significant economic losses in rice production in China and many other Asian countries. Although a great deal of effort has been made to elucidate the interactions among the virus, insect vectors, host and environmental conditions, few RBSDV proteins involved in pathogenesis have been identified, and the biological basis of disease development in rice remains largely unknown. Transcriptomic information associated with the disease development in rice would be helpful to unravel the biological mechanism. To determine how the rice transcriptome changes in response to RBSDV infection, we carried out RNA-Seq to perform a genome-wide gene expression analysis of a susceptible rice cultivar KTWYJ3. The transcriptomes of RBSDV-infected samples were compared to those of RBSDV-free (healthy) at two time points (time points are represented by group I and II). The results derived from the differential expression analysis in RBSDV-infected libraries vs. healthy ones in group I revealed that 102 out of a total of 281 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 179 DEGs were down-regulated. Of the 2592 identified DEGs in group II, 1588 DEGs were up-regulated and 1004 DEGs were down-regulated. A total of 66 DEGs were commonly identified in both groups. Of these 66 DEGs, expression patterns for 36 DEGs were similar in both groups. Our analysis demonstrated that some genes related to disease defense and stress resistance were up-regulated while genes associated with chloroplast were down-regulated in response to RBSDV infection. In addition, some genes associated with plant-height were differentially expressed. This result indicates those genes might be involved in dwarf symptoms caused by RBSDV. Taken together, our results provide a genome-wide transcriptome analysis for rice plants in response to RBSDV infection which may contribute to the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in rice-RBSDV interaction and the biological basis of rice black-streaked dwarf disease development in rice.
28698160	Investigating the regulatory roles of the microRNAs and the Argonaute 1-enriched small RNAs in plant metabolism.	2017	Gene	The biological roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in metabolic processes are emerging. However, a systemic study is needed to investigate the wide-spread involvement of the sRNAs in plant metabolism. By using the metabolism-related transcripts retrieved from the public database Plant Metabolic Network, and the publicly available sRNA high-throughput sequencing data, large-scale target identification was performed for microRNAs (miRNAs) and Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-enriched sRNAs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Based on the publicly available degradome sequencing data, 200 miRNA/sRNA-target pairs involving 19 miRNAs, 111 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 58 target transcripts in Arabidopsis, and 151 pairs involving 62 miRNAs, 33 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 69 target transcripts in rice were identified. After considering protein-protein interactions for the above identified target genes, a total of 251 pairs involving 21 miRNAs, 120 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 75 target transcripts exist within the regulatory network of Arabidopsis, and 168 pairs involving 64 miRNAs, 38 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 80 target transcripts exist in rice. Based on GO (Gene Ontology) term enrichment analysis, the targets within the networks of both plants are enriched in "metabolic process" and "catalytic activity", pointing to the high relevance of the established networks to metabolism. Several functionally conserved subnetworks were identified between the two plant species. Our study provides a basis for studies on metabolism-related sRNAs in plants.
28737678	An Update on Jacalin-Like Lectins and Their Role in Plant Defense.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Plant lectins are proteins that reversibly bind carbohydrates and are assumed to play an important role in plant development and resistance. Through the binding of carbohydrate ligands, lectins are involved in the perception of environmental signals and their translation into phenotypical responses. These processes require down-stream signaling cascades, often mediated by interacting proteins. Fusing the respective genes of two interacting proteins can be a way to increase the efficiency of this process. Most recently, proteins containing jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains became a subject of plant resistance responses research. A meta-data analysis of fusion proteins containing JRL domains across different kingdoms revealed diverse partner domains ranging from kinases to toxins. Among them, proteins containing a JRL domain and a dirigent domain occur exclusively within monocotyledonous plants and show an unexpected high range of family member expansion compared to other JRL-fusion proteins. Rice, wheat, and barley plants overexpressing OsJAC1, a member of this family, are resistant against important fungal pathogens. We discuss the possibility that JRL domains also function as a decoy in fusion proteins and help to alert plants of the presence of attacking pathogens.
28716105	Characterization of four rice UEV1 genes required for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination and distinct functions.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The error-free branch of the DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) pathway is orchestrated by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and this polyubiquitination is mediated by a Ubc13-Uev complex in yeast. We have previously cloned OsUBC13 from rice, whose product functions as an E2 to promote Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain assembly in the presence of yeast or human Uev.

RESULTS: Here we identify four highly conserved UEV1 genes in rice whose products are able to form stable heterodimers with OsUbc13 and mediate Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain assembly. Expression of OsUEV1s is able to rescue the yeast mms2 mutant from death caused by DNA-damaging agents. Interestingly, OsUev1A contains a unique C-terminal tail with a conserved prenylation site not found in the other three OsUev1s, and this post-translational modification appears to be required for its unique subcellular distribution and association with the membrane. The analysis of OsUEV1 expression profiles obtained from the Genevestigator database indicates that these genes are differentially regulated.

CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that different OsUev1s play distinct roles by serving as a regulatory subunit of the Ubc13-Uev1 complex to respond to diverse cellular, developmental and environmental signals.
28798768	<i>Laccase-13</i> Regulates Seed Setting Rate by Affecting Hydrogen Peroxide Dynamics and Mitochondrial Integrity in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Seed setting rate is one of the most important components of rice grain yield. To date, only several genes regulating setting rate have been identified in plant. In this study, we showed that laccase-13 (OsLAC13), a member of laccase family genes which are known for their roles in modulating phenylpropanoid pathway and secondary lignification in cell wall, exerts a regulatory function in rice seed setting rate. OsLAC13 expressed in anthers and promotes hydrogen peroxide production both in vitro and in the filaments and anther connectives. Knock-out of OsLAC13 showed significantly increased seed setting rate, while overexpression of this gene exhibited induced mitochondrial damage and suppressed sugar transportation in anthers, which in turn affected seed setting rate. OsLAC13 also induced H2O2 production and mitochondrial damage in the root tip cells which caused the lethal phenotype. We also showed that high abundant of OsmiR397, the suppressor of OsLAC13 mRNA, increased the seed setting rate of rice plants, and restrains H2O2 accumulation in roots during oxidative stress. Our results suggested a novel regulatory role of OsLAC13 gene in regulating seed setting rate by affecting H2O2 dynamics and mitochondrial integrity in rice.
28715430	Resequencing and variation identification of whole genome of the japonica rice variety "Longdao24" with high yield.	2017	PLoS One	Japonica rice mainly distributes in north of China, which accounts for more than half of the total japonica rice cultivated area of China. High yield, good grain quality and early heading date were the main breeding traits and commercial property in this region. We performed re-sequencing and genome wide variation analysis of one typical northern japonica rice variety Longdao24 and its parents (Longdao5 and Jigeng83) using the Illumina sequencing technology. 53.17 G clean bases were generated and more than 96.8% of the reads were mapped to the genomic reference sequence. An overall average effective depth of 43.67 × coverage was achieved. We identified 420,475 SNPs, 95,624 InDels, and 14,112 SVs in Longdao24 genome with the genomic sequence of the japonica cultivar Nipponbare as reference. We identified 361,117 SNPs and 81,488 InDels between Longdao24 genome and Longdao5 genome. We also detected 428,908 SNPs and 97,209 InDels between Longdao24 genome and Jigeng83 genome. Twenty-two yield related genes, twenty-two grain quality related genes and thirty-nine heading date genes were analyzed in Longdao24. The alleles of Gn1a, EP3, SCM2, Wx, ALK, OsLF and Hd17 came from the female parent Longdao5. The other alleles of qGW8, SSIVa, SBE3, SSIIIb, SSIIc, DTH2, Ehd3 and OsMADS56 came from the male parent Jigeng83. These results will help us to research the genetics basis of yield, grain quality and early heading date in northern rice of China.
28621830	Phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing arsenic levels in rice grains.	2017	Plant J	Reduction of the level of arsenic (As) in rice grains is an important challenge for agriculture. A recent study reported that the OsABCC1 transporter prevents the accumulation of As in grains by sequestering As-phytochelatin complexes into vacuoles in the upper nodes. However, how phytochelatins are provided in response to As remains unclear. Here, we show that the phytochelatin synthase OsPCS1 plays a crucial role in reducing As levels in rice grains. Using a forward genetic approach, we isolated two rice mutants (has1 and has2) in which As levels were much higher in grains but significantly lower in node I compared with the wild type. Map-based cloning identified the genes responsible as OsABCC1 in has1 and OsPCS1 in has2. The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with OsPCS1 to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2. An in vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that OsPCS1 was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium. Transgenic plants highly expressing OsPCS1 showed significantly lower As levels in grains than did wild-type plants. Our results provide new knowledge of the relative contribution of rice PCS paralogs to As sequestration and suggest a good candidate tool to reduce As levels in rice grains.
28706198	Inhibitory effect of eugenol on seed germination and pre-harvest sprouting of hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Sci Rep	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is a constrain problem in hybrid rice production. The present study was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effect of eugenol on seed germination and PHS of hybrid rice variety (Qian You 1). The results showed that seed germination speed and the activities of α-amylase were inhibited by eugenol pre-soaking and these effects enhanced with the increasing of eugenol concentrations; while seedling growth was not negatively affected. In field trials, eugenol application caused a significant decline in PHS as compared with control, whereas no sustained inhibition in post-harvested seed germination was observed. The HPLC analysis indicated that eugenol raised the internal ABA content by 1-4 times more than control, and seeds treated with eugenol had relatively lower OsABA8OH2 and higher transcript levels of OsNCED2 expression during early stages of seed imbibitions. In addition, seed germinated faster after GA3 application than eugenol alone, and seed endogenous ABA content decreased obviously. It suggested that eugenol strongly delayed seed germination and the PHS in the field, which might be mainly due to the increased ABA contents caused by eugenol. However, the phenomenon of delayed germination and high ABA content caused by eugenol could be effectively recovered by exogenous GA3.
28756251	Linking hydrogen-enhanced rice aluminum tolerance with the reestablishment of GA/ABA balance and miRNA-modulated gene expression: A case study on germination.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Although previous results showed that exogenous hydrogen (H2) alleviated aluminum (Al) toxicity, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reported that the exposure of germinating rice seeds to Al triggered H2 production, followed by a decrease of GA/ABA ratio and seed germination inhibition. Compared to inert gas (argon), H2 pretreatment not only strengthened H2 production and alleviated Al-induced germination inhibition, but also partially reestablished the balance between GA and ABA. By contrast, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) could block the H2-alleviated germination inhibition. The expression of GA biosynthesis genes (GA20ox1 and GA20ox2) and ABA catabolism genes (ABA8ox1 and ABA8ox2), was also induced by H2. Above results indicated that GA/ABA might be partially involved in H2 responses. Subsequent results revealed that compared with Al alone, transcripts of miR398a and miR159a were decreased by H2, and expression levels of their target genes OsSOD2 and OsGAMYB were up-regulated. Whereas, miR528 and miR160a transcripts were increased differentially, and contrasting tendencies were observed in the changes of their target genes (OsAO and OsARF10). The transcripts of Al-tolerant gene OsSTAR1/OsSTAR2 and OsFRDL4 were up-regulated. Above results were consistent with the anti-oxidant defense, decreased Al accumulation, and enhanced citrate efflux. Together, our results provided insight into the mechanism underlying H2-triggered Al tolerance in plants.
28769958	<i>Oryza sativa</i> BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 LIKE1 Induces the Expression of a Gene Encoding a Small Leucine-Rich-Repeat Protein to Positively Regulate Lamina Inclination and Grain Size in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 LIKE1 (OsBUL1) positively affects lamina inclination and grain size. OsBUL1 knock-out (osbul1) plants as well as transgenic rice with reduced level of OsBUL1 expression produce erect leaves and small grains. Here, we identified a putative downstream gene of OsBUL1, OsBUL1 DOWNSTREAM GENE1 (OsBDG1) encoding a small protein with short leucine-rich-repeats by cDNA microarray analyses in the lamina joint and panicles of wild-type and osbul1 plants. Transgenic rice plants with increased OsBDG1 expression exhibit increased leaf angle and grain size, which is similar to an OsBDG1 activation tagging line whereas double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) lines for OsBDG1 knock-down generate erect leaves with smaller grains. Moreover, transgenic rice expressing OsBDG1 under the control of OsBUL1 promoter also shows enlarged leaf bending and grain size phenotypes. Two genes, OsAP2 (OsAPETALA2) and OsWRKY24 were identified as being upregulated transcriptional activators in the lamina joint of pOsBUL1:OsBDG1 plants and induced expression of the two genes driven by OsBUL1 promoter caused increased lamina inclination and grain size in rice. Thus, our work demonstrates that a series of genes showing expression cascades are involved in the promotion of cell elongation in lamina joints and functionally cause increased lamina inclination.
28751900	Conserved Function of Fibrillin5 in the Plastoquinone-9 Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis and Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) is essential for plant growth and development. Recently, we found that fibrillin5 (FBN5), a plastid lipid binding protein, is an essential structural component of the PQ-9 biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis. To investigate the functional conservation of FBN5 in monocots and eudicots, we identified OsFBN5, the Arabidopsis FBN5 (AtFBN5) ortholog in rice (Oryza sativa). Homozygous Osfbn5-1 and Osfbn5-2 Tos17 insertion null mutants were smaller than wild type (WT) plants when grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium and died quickly when transplanted to soil in a greenhouse. They accumulated significantly less PQ-9 than WT plants, whereas chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were only mildly affected. The reduced PQ-9 content of the mutants was consistent with their lower maximum photosynthetic efficiency, especially under high light. Overexpression of OsFBN5 complemented the seedling lethal phenotype of the Arabidopsis fbn5-1 mutant and restored PQ-9 and PC-8 (plastochromanol-8) to levels comparable to those in WT Arabidopsis plants. Protein interaction experiments in yeast and mesophyll cells confirmed that OsFBN5 interacts with the rice solanesyl diphosphate synthase OsSPS2 and also with Arabidopsis AtSPS1 and AtSPS2. Our data thus indicate that OsFBN5 is the functional equivalent of AtFBN5 and also suggest that the SPSs-FBN5 complex for synthesis of the solanesyl diphosphate tail in PQ-9 is well conserved in Arabidopsis and rice.
28761138	An atypical strictosidine synthase, OsSTRL2, plays key roles in anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Strictosidine synthase (STR) plays an important role in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) and is expressed in a range of active meristematic tissues of higher plants. STR proteins are involved in different physiological and biochemical pathways. However, the function of STR proteins in rice development remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified 21 possible STR-like (OsSTRL) family members in rice genome and found that only one gene, OsSTRL2, exhibited a pre-emergency specific florescence expression pattern. Tissue-specific expression profile analysis, β-glucuronidase histochemical (GUS) staining and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed that OsSTRL2 was highly expressed in tapetal cells and microspores. Comparative protein sequence analysis indicated that OsSTRL2 lacked the key catalytic residue found in a typical STR (STR1), although it possessed conserved β-propellers and α-helices formed the basic structure of STR1. OsSTRL2 knockout mutant resulted to male sterility because of the defects in anther development and pollen wall formation. Subcellular localization of OsSTRL2-YFP revealed that the OsSTRL2 protein was primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, OsSTRL2 is an atypical strictosidine synthase that plays crucial roles in regulating anther development and pollen wall formation in rice.
28690154	Overexpression of a novel MYB-related transcription factor, OsMYBR1, confers improved drought tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The MYB proteins play important roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses. We cloned and functionally characterized a novel MYB-related gene, OsMYBR1, from rice. Our microarray and qRT-PCR analyses showed that its expression was induced by drought and cold in different tissues at various developmental stages. This gene encodes a putative MYB-related protein of 463 amino acid residues. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic plants over-expressing OsMYBR1 exhibited much greater tolerance to drought stress and decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). Under drought treatment, levels of free proline and soluble sugar were higher in transgenic plants than in the WT. Furthermore, transcriptional expression of four stress-related genes -- OsP5CS1, OsProt, OsLEA3, and OsRab16 -- was significantly increased in transgenic plants under drought stressed conditions and ABA. Our results provide evidence that OsMYBR1 is involved in mediating plant responses to ABA and drought.
28700714	Genome wide re-sequencing of newly developed Rice Lines from common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) for the identification of NBS-LRR genes.	2017	PLoS One	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is an important germplasm for rice breeding, which contains many resistance genes. Re-sequencing provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the abundant useful genes at whole genome level. Here, we identified the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) encoding genes by re-sequencing of two wild rice lines (i.e. Huaye 1 and Huaye 2) that were developed from common wild rice. We obtained 128 to 147 million reads with approximately 32.5-fold coverage depth, and uniquely covered more than 89.6% (> = 1 fold) of reference genomes. Two wild rice lines showed high SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) variation rate in 12 chromosomes against the reference genomes of Nipponbare (japonica cultivar) and 93-11 (indica cultivar). InDels (insertion/deletion polymorphisms) count-length distribution exhibited normal distribution in the two lines, and most of the InDels were ranged from -5 to 5 bp. With reference to the Nipponbare genome sequence, we detected a total of 1,209,308 SNPs, 161,117 InDels and 4,192 SVs (structural variations) in Huaye 1, and 1,387,959 SNPs, 180,226 InDels and 5,305 SVs in Huaye 2. A total of 44.9% and 46.9% genes exhibited sequence variations in two wild rice lines compared to the Nipponbare and 93-11 reference genomes, respectively. Analysis of NBS-LRR mutant candidate genes showed that they were mainly distributed on chromosome 11, and NBS domain was more conserved than LRR domain in both wild rice lines. NBS genes depicted higher levels of genetic diversity in Huaye 1 than that found in Huaye 2. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction analysis showed that NBS genes mostly interacted with the cytochrome C protein (Os05g0420600, Os01g0885000 and BGIOSGA038922), while some NBS genes interacted with heat shock protein, DNA-binding activity, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase and a coiled coil region. We explored abundant NBS-LRR encoding genes in two common wild rice lines through genome wide re-sequencing, which proved to be a useful tool to exploit elite NBS-LRR genes in wild rice. The data here provide a foundation for future work aimed at dissecting the genetic basis of disease resistance in rice, and the two wild rice lines will be useful germplasm for the molecular improvement of cultivated rice.
28708858	OsCNGC13 promotes seed-setting rate by facilitating pollen tube growth in stylar tissues.	2017	PLoS Genet	Seed-setting rate is a critical determinant of grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rapid and healthy pollen tube growth in the style is required for high seed-setting rate. The molecular mechanisms governing this process remain largely unknown. In this study, we isolate a dominant low seed-setting rate rice mutant, sss1-D. Cellular examination results show that pollen tube growth is blocked in about half of the mutant styles. Molecular cloning and functional assays reveals that SSS1-D encodes OsCNGC13, a member of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel family. OsCNGC13 is preferentially expressed in the pistils and its expression is dramatically reduced in the heterozygous plant, suggesting a haploinsufficiency nature for the dominant mutant phenotype. We show that OsCNGC13 is permeable to Ca2+. Consistent with this, accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is defective in the sss1-D mutant style after pollination. Further, the sss1-D mutant has altered extracellular matrix (ECM) components and delayed cell death in the style transmission tract (STT). Based on these results, we propose that OsCNGC13 acts as a novel maternal sporophytic factor required for stylar [Ca2+]cyt accumulation, ECM components modification and STT cell death, thus facilitating the penetration of pollen tube in the style for successful double fertilization and seed-setting in rice.
28730411	Sugary Endosperm is Modulated by Starch Branching Enzyme IIa in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Starch biosynthesis is one of the most important pathways that determine both grain quality and yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sugary endosperm, sugary-1 (sug-1), is a mutant trait for starch biosynthesis. Rice plants carrying sug-1 produce grains that accumulate water-soluble carbohydrates instead of starch, even after maturity. Although this trait enhances the diversity of grain quality, sugary endosperm rice has hardly been commercialized due to the severely wrinkled grains and subsequent problems in milling. This study was conducted to identify the genes responsible for the sug-h phenotype through a map-based cloning technology.

RESULTS: We induced a mild sugary mutant, sugary-h (sug-h) through the chemical mutagenesis on the Korean japonica cultivar Hwacheong. Grains of the sug-h mutant were translucent and amber-colored, and the endosperm appeared less wrinkled than sug-1, whereas the soluble sugar content was fairly high. These characteristics confer greater marketability to the sug-h mutant. Genetic analyses indicated that the sug-h mutant phenotype was controlled by a complementary interaction of two recessive genes, Isoamylase1 (OsISA1), which was reported previously, and Starch branching enzyme IIa (OsBEIIa), which was newly identified in this study. Complementation tests indicated that OsBEIIa regulated the properties of sugary endosperm.

CONCLUSIONS: Complementary interactions between the starch biosynthesis genes OsISA1 and OsBEIIa determine the mild sugary endosperm mutant, sugary-h, in rice. Our finding may facilitate the breeding of sugaryendosperm rice for commercial benefit.
28708834	OsMPH1 regulates plant height and improves grain yield in rice.	2017	PLoS One	Plant height is a major trait affecting yield potential in rice. Using a large-scale hybrid transcription factor approach, we identified the novel MYB-like transcription factor OsMPH1 (MYB-like gene of Plant Height 1), which is involved in the regulation of plant height in rice. Overexpression of OsMPH1 leads to increases of plant height and grain yield in rice, while knockdown of OsMPH1 leads to the opposite phenotypes. Microscopy of longitudinal stem sections indicated that a change in internode cell length resulted in the change in plant height. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of transgenic rice lines showed that multiple genes related to cell elongation and cell wall synthesis, which are associated with plant height and yield phenotypes, exhibited an altered expression profile. These results imply that OsMPH1 might be involved in specific recognition and signal transduction processes related to plant height and yield formation, providing further insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of plant height and providing a candidate gene for the efficient improvement of rice yield.
28676963	Knocking out of carotenoid catabolic genes in rice fails to boost carotenoid accumulation, but reveals a mutation in strigolactone biosynthesis.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Targeted mutations in five carotenoid catabolism genes failed to boost carotenoid accumulation in rice seeds, but produced dwarf and high tillering mutants when OsCCD7 gene was knocked out. Carotenoids play an important role in human diet as a source of vitamin A. Rice is a major staple food in Asia, but does not accumulate carotenoids in the endosperm because of the low carotenoid biosynthesis or the degradation in metabolism. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was investigated in the targeted knockout of five rice carotenoid catabolic genes (OsCYP97A4, OsDSM2, OsCCD4a, OsCCD4b and OsCCD7) and in an effort to increase β-carotene accumulation in rice endosperm. Transgenic plants that expressed OsNLSCas9 and sgRNAs were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Various knockout mutations were identified at the T0 generation of the transgenic rice by TILLING and direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from the target sites. Carotenoids were not accumulated in both mono-allelic and bi-allelic knockout mutations of the five genes. However, transgenic plants with homozygous or bi-allelic mutations to the OsCCD7 gene were extremely dwarfish with more tillers and lower seed setting than other transgenic or nontransgenic plants. This phenotype was similar to the previously reported ccd7 mutants, which are defective in the biosynthesis of strigolactone, a plant hormone that regulates branching in plants and tiller formation in rice.
28751317	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1, OsPRI1, Facilitates Iron Homeostasis.	2017	Plant Physiol	Oryza sativa HEMERYTHRIN MOTIF-CONTAINING REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE AND ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN1 (OsHRZ1) is a putative iron-binding sensor. However, it is unclear how OsHRZ1 transmits signals. In this study, we reveal that POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS1 (OsPRI1) interacts with OsHRZ1. A loss-of-function mutation to OsPRI1 increased the sensitivity of plants to Fe-deficient conditions and down-regulated the expression of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters. In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1. Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild-type roots but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1. The hrz1-2 seedlings were insensitive to Fe-deficient conditions. When the pri1-1 mutation was introduced into hrz1-2 mutants, the pri1hrz1 double mutant was more sensitive to Fe deficiency than the hrz1-2 mutant. Additionally, the expression levels of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were lower in the hrz1pri1 double mutant than in the hrz1-2 mutant. Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade.
28726715	Overexpression of the OsIMP Gene Increases the Accumulation of Inositol and Confers Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Tobacco through Modulation of the Antioxidant Enzymes' Activities.	2017	Genes (Basel)	Inositol is a cyclic polyol that is involved in various physiological processes, including signal transduction and stress adaptation in plants. l-myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) is one of the metal-dependent phosphatase family members and catalyzes the last reaction step of biosynthesis of inositol. Although increased IMPase activity induced by abiotic stress has been reported in chickpea plants, the role and regulation of the IMP gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.) remains poorly understood. In the present work, we obtained a full-length cDNA sequence coding IMPase in the cold tolerant rice landraces in Gaogonggui, which is named as OsIMP. Multiple alignment results have displayed that this sequence has characteristic signature motifs and conserved enzyme active sites of the phosphatase super family. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IMPase is most closely related to that of the wild rice Oryza brachyantha, while transcript analysis revealed that the expression of the OsIMP is significantly induced by cold stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Meanwhile, we cloned the 5' flanking promoter sequence of the OsIMP gene and identified several important cis-acting elements, such as LTR (low-temperature responsiveness), TCA-element (salicylic acid responsiveness), ABRE-element (abscisic acid responsiveness), GARE-motif (gibberellin responsive), MBS (MYB Binding Site) and other cis-acting elements related to defense and stress responsiveness. To further investigate the potential function of the OsIMP gene, we generated transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OsIMP gene and the cold tolerance test indicated that these transgenic tobacco plants exhibit improved cold tolerance. Furthermore, transgenic tobacco plants have a lower level of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and a higher content of total chlorophyll as well as increased antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), when compared to wild type (WT) tobacco plants under normal and cold stress conditions.
28818372	Functional characterization of rice CW-domain containing zinc finger proteins involved in histone recognition.	2017	Plant Sci	Histone recognition is important for understanding the mechanisms of histone modification, which play a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation during plant development. Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7. Protein sequence analysis showed that they have two unknown motifs in addition to the CW domain. All three OsCW-ZFs were expressed in aerial tissues, with relatively high levels in developing panicles. Subcellular localization revealed that the OsCW-ZFs target the cell nucleus and CW domains are not necessary for their nuclear localization. In contrast to OsCW-ZF3 and OsCW-ZF5 where the CW domains bind histone H3 lysine 4 with different methylated forms (H3K4me), the CW domain from OsCW-ZF7 recognizes only trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Analysis of mutant suggested that three conserved tryptophan residues in the CW domain are essential for binding to H3K4me. Further study found that OsCW-ZF7 interacts with TAFII20, a transcription initiation factor TFIID 20kDa subunit. Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the CW domain and lays a foundation for further investigation of its roles in rice.
28747699	OsFH15, a class I formin, interacts with microfilaments and microtubules to regulate grain size via affecting cell expansion in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Grain size is an important agronomic trait determining rice yield and is mainly restricted by spikelet hull size. However, it remains largely unknown how the spikelet hull size is regulated. In this study, OsFH15, a class I formin protein in Oryza sativa, was found to be able to regulate the size of cells and spikelet hull. OsFH15-Cas9 and OsFH15-RNAi mutants had decreased grain size with reduced cell length, cell width and cell area of inner epidermal cells of the lemma compared with wild-type plants. By contrast, OsFH15-overexpressed plants had increased grain size with larger cells, as well as more abundant microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) arrays. OsFH15 was mainly expressed in shoot apical meristem (SAM), spikelets, spikelet hulls and seeds in rice. In vitro biochemical experiments showed that OsFH15 can efficiently nucleate actin polymerization with or without profilin, can cap the barbed end of AFs, and can bind and bundle both AFs and MTs. OsFH15 can also crosslink AFs with MTs, and preferentially bind MTs to AFs. These results demonstrated that OsFH15 played an important role in grain-size control by affecting cell expansion through regulating AFs and MTs.
28554475	OsCOL16, encoding a CONSTANS-like protein, represses flowering by up-regulating Ghd7 expression in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	Flowering time is an important agronomic trait that coordinates the plant life cycle with regional adaptability and thereby impacts yield potentials for cereal crops. The CONSTANS (CO)-like gene family plays vital roles in the regulation of flowering time. CO-like proteins are typically divided into four phylogenetic groups in rice. Several genes from groups I, III, and IV have been functionally characterized, though little is known about the genes of group II in rice. We report the functional characterization in rice of a constitutive floral inhibitor, OsCOL16, encoding a group-II CO-like protein that delays flowering time and increases plant height and grain yield. Overexpression of OsCOL16 resulted in late heading under both long-day and short-day conditions. OsCOL16 expression exhibits a diurnal oscillation and serves as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. We determined that OsCOL16 up-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7, leading to down-regulation of the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. Moreover, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses suggest that remarkable differences in flowering times correlate with two major alleles of OsCOL16. Our combined molecular biology and phylogeographic analyses revealed that OsCOL16 plays an important role in regulating rice photoperiodic flowering, allowing for environmental adaptation of rice.
28698641	A Transcription Activator-Like Effector Tal7 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola Activates Rice Gene Os09g29100 to Suppress Rice Immunity.	2017	Sci Rep	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) cause bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and bacterial leaf blight (BLB) in rice, respectively. Unlike Xoo, endogenous avirulence-resistance (avr-R) gene interactions have not been identified in the Xoc-rice pathosystem; however, both pathogens possess transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that are known to modulate R or S genes in rice. The transfer of individual tal genes from Xoc RS105 (hypervirulent) into Xoc YNB0-17 (hypovirulent) led to the identification of tal7, which suppressed avrXa7-Xa7 mediated defense in rice containing an Xa7 R gene. Mobility shift and microscale thermophoresis assays showed that Tal7 bound two EBE sites in the promoters of two rice genes, Os09g29100 and Os12g42970, which encode predicted Cyclin-D4-1 and GATA zinc finger family protein, respectively. Assays using designer TALEs and a TALE-free strain of Xoo revealed that Os09g29100 was the biologically relevant target of Tal7. Tal7 activates the expression of rice gene Os09g29100 that suppresses avrXa7-Xa7 mediated defense in Rice. TALEN editing of the Tal7-binding site in the Os09g29100 gene promoter further enhanced resistance to the pathogen Xoc RS105. The suppression of effector-trigger immunity (ETI) is a phenomenon that may contribute to the scarcity of BLS resistant cultivars.
28775727	Overexpression of Golgi Protein CYP21-4s Improves Crop Productivity in Potato and Rice by Increasing the Abundance of Mannosidic Glycoproteins.	2017	Front Plant Sci	CYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin protein involved in oxidative stress tolerance. Here, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing AtCYP21-4 and OsCYP21-4 in potato and rice, respectively. The stems and roots of AtCYP21-4-overexpressing potato plants were longer than those of wild-type (WT) plants, which resulted in heavier tubers. In vitro tuberization in the transgenic potato also resulted in significantly greater tuber number and weight, as well as a shorter time to microtuber formation. Similarly, OsCYP21-4-overexpressing transgenic rice plants had higher biomass and productivity with longer early-stage internodes than the WT and higher seed weight. Immunoblot analysis with CYP21-4 antibody showed that these productivity-enhancing phenotypes were associated with high CYP21-4s protein expression. Anatomically, transgenic potato stems exhibited higher lignin content in xylem cells and thicker leaves. In addition, relative content of mannosidic glycoproteins per unit of total protein was above 20% in transgenic potato tubers and rice grains. Based on these findings, we propose that CYP21-4s are involved in the growth and development of plant vegetative and storage tissues via their effects on glycoprotein abundance or glycan processing in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, increasing CYP21-4s expression in crops could represent an alternative way to increase crop productivity and yield.
28797946	Genome-wide screening of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and indica reveals a complex family of proteins with ribosome-inactivating protein domains.	2017	Phytochemistry	Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are cytotoxic enzymes capable of halting protein synthesis by irreversible modification of ribosomes. Although RIPs are widespread they are not ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. The physiological importance of RIPs is not fully elucidated, but evidence suggests a role in the protection of the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses. Searches in the rice genome revealed a large and highly complex family of proteins with a RIP domain. A comparative analysis retrieved 38 RIP sequences from the genome sequence of Oryza sativa subspecies japonica and 34 sequences from the subspecies indica. The RIP sequences are scattered over different chromosomes but are mostly found on the third chromosome. The phylogenetic tree revealed the pairwise clustering of RIPs from japonica and indica. Molecular modeling and sequence analysis yielded information on the catalytic site of the enzyme, and suggested that a large part of RIP domains probably possess N-glycosidase activity. Several RIPs are differentially expressed in plant tissues and in response to specific abiotic stresses. This study provides an overview of RIP motifs in rice and will help to understand their biological role(s) and evolutionary relationships.
28839043	Incorporating Gene Annotation into Genomic Prediction of Complex Phenotypes.	2017	Genetics	Today, genomic prediction (GP) is an established technology in plant and animal breeding programs. Current standard methods are purely based on statistical considerations but do not make use of the abundant biological knowledge, which is easily available from public databases. Major questions that have to be answered before biological prior information can be used routinely in GP approaches are which types of information can be used, and at which points they can be incorporated into prediction methods. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to incorporate gene annotation into GP of complex phenotypes by defining haploblocks according to gene positions. Haplotype effects are then modeled as categorical or as numerical allele dosage variables. The underlying concept of this approach is to build the statistical model on variables representing the biologically functional units. We evaluate the new methods with data from a heterogeneous stock mouse population, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), and a rice breeding population from the Rice Diversity Panel. Our results show that using gene annotation to define haploblocks often leads to a comparable, but for some traits to a higher, predictive ability compared to SNP-based models or to haplotype models that do not use gene annotation information. Modeling gene interaction effects can further improve predictive ability. We also illustrate that the additional use of markers that have not been mapped to any gene in a second separate relatedness matrix does in many cases not lead to a relevant additional increase in predictive ability when the first matrix is based on haploblocks defined with gene annotation data, suggesting that intergenic markers only provide redundant information on the considered data sets. Therefore, gene annotation information seems to be appropriate to perceive the importance of DNA segments. Finally, we discuss the effects of gene annotation quality, marker density, and linkage disequilibrium on the performance of the new methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates epistatic interaction or gene annotation into haplotype-based prediction approaches.
28813631	Rapid and targeted introgression of fgr gene through marker-assisted backcrossing in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Genome	While it is crucial for developing countries like Malaysia to achieve self-sufficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.), it is equally critical to be able to produce high-quality rice, specifically fragrant rice, which demands are often met through importation. The present study was aimed at developing high-yielding fragrant rice, in a timely and cost-effective manner. A marker-assisted backcross (MABC) approach was optimised to introgress the fragrance gene (fgr) into two high-yielding Malaysian varieties, MR84 and MR219, within two years utilising less than 50 molecular markers. Coupled with phenotypic screening, one single foreground marker (fgr-SNP) and 48 background markers were selected and utilised, revealing recovery of at least 90% of recurrent parent genome (RPG) in merely two backcross generations. Collectively, the yield potential of the developed BC2F2 lines (BLs) was higher (P > 0.05) than the donor parent, MRQ74, and similar (P < 0.05) to both the recurrent parents, MR84 and MR219. In addition, some of the developed BLs showed good grain quality, such as having long grain. We believe that this is the first report comprising the validation and utilisation of the single functional marker system (fgr-SNP) in introgressing the fgr gene into different rice varieties.
28847935	<i>LATERAL FLORET 1</i> induced the three-florets spikelet in rice.	2017	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure in grass. The molecular mechanisms behind the development and evolution of the spikelet are far from clear. In this study, a dominant rice mutant, lateral florets 1 (lf1), was characterized. In the lf1 spikelet, lateral floral meristems were promoted unexpectedly and could generally blossom into relatively normal florets. LF1 encoded a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) protein, and the site of mutation in lf1 was located in a putative miRNA165/166 target sequence. Ectopic expression of both LF1 and the meristem maintenance gene OSH1 was detected in the axil of the sterile lemma primordia of the lf1 spikelet. Furthermore, the promoter of OSH1 could be bound directly by LF1 protein. Collectively, these results indicate that the mutation of LF1 induces ectopic expression of OSH1, which results in the initiation of lateral meristems to generate lateral florets in the axil of the sterile lemma. This study thus offers strong evidence in support of the "three-florets spikelet" hypothesis in rice.
28839042	Evolutionarily Conserved Alternative Splicing Across Monocots.	2017	Genetics	One difficulty when identifying alternative splicing (AS) events in plants is distinguishing functional AS from splicing noise. One way to add confidence to the validity of a splice isoform is to observe that it is conserved across evolutionarily related species. We use a high throughput method to identify junction-based conserved AS events from RNA-Seq data across nine plant species, including five grass monocots (maize, sorghum, rice, Brachpodium, and foxtail millet), plus two nongrass monocots (banana and African oil palm), the eudicot Arabidopsis, and the basal angiosperm Amborella In total, 9804 AS events were found to be conserved between two or more species studied. In grasses containing large regions of conserved synteny, the frequency of conserved AS events is twice that observed for genes outside of conserved synteny blocks. In plant-specific RS and RS2Z subfamilies of the serine/arginine (SR) splice-factor proteins, we observe both conservation and divergence of AS events after the whole genome duplication in maize. In addition, plant-specific RS and RS2Z splice-factor subfamilies are highly connected with R2R3-MYB in STRING functional protein association networks built using genes exhibiting conserved AS. Furthermore, we discovered that functional protein association networks constructed around genes harboring conserved AS events are enriched for phosphatases, kinases, and ubiquitylation genes, which suggests that AS may participate in regulating signaling pathways. These data lay the foundation for identifying and studying conserved AS events in the monocots, particularly across grass species, and this conserved AS resource identifies an additional layer between genotype to phenotype that may impact future crop improvement efforts.
28824674	The Rice Peptide Transporter <i>OsNPF7.3</i> Is Induced by Organic Nitrogen, and Contributes to Nitrogen Allocation and Grain Yield.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Nitrogen use efficiency is important for the development of sustainable agriculture. Plants have different transporters to facilitate nitrogen uptake and internal distribution. This study demonstrates that the peptide transporter OsNPF7.3 enhances nitrogen allocation and increases grain yield in rice. OsNPF7.3 is a member of the nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) and is localized in the vacuolar membrane. Its expression is higher in the lateral roots and stems. Its transcripts concentrate in the vascular bundle and significantly regulated by organic nitrogen sources. The RNAi lines of OsNPF7.3 affect plant growth and cause amino acids to accumulate in leaf sheaths and decrease in the leaf blades. At later stages of reproductive growth, nitrogen degradation accelerates in the leaves of plants over-expressing OsNPF7.3 and the nitrogen is translocated to grains. The tiller numbers, panicles per plant, filled grain numbers per panicle, and grain nitrogen content of the OsNPF7.3 over-expressing plant were more than that of wide type. The elevated gene expression in OsNPF7.3 could enhance nitrogen utilization efficiency in rice paddy.
28856519	OsPPR6, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in editing and splicing chloroplast RNA, is required for chloroplast biogenesis in rice.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: OsPPR6, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in editing and splicing chloroplast RNA, is required for chloroplast biogenesis in rice. The chloroplast has its own genetic material and genetic system, but it is also regulated by nuclear-encoded genes. However, little is known about nuclear-plastid regulatory mechanisms underlying early chloroplast biogenesis in rice. In this study, we isolated and characterized a mutant, osppr6, that showed early chloroplast developmental defects leading to albino leaves and seedling death. We found that the osppr6 mutant failed to form thylakoid membranes. Using map-based cloning and complementation tests, we determined that OsPPR6 encoded a new Pentatricopeptide Repeat (PPR) protein localized in plastids. In the osppr6 mutants, mRNA levels of plastidic genes transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase decreased, while those of genes transcribed by the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase increased. Western blot analyses validated these expression results. We further investigated plastidic RNA editing and splicing in the osppr6 mutants and found that the ndhB transcript was mis-edited and the ycf3 transcript was mis-spliced. Therefore, we demonstrate that OsPPR6, a PPR protein, regulates early chloroplast biogenesis and participates in editing of ndhB and splicing of ycf3 transcripts in rice.
28857222	OsTGAP1 is responsible for JA-inducible diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice roots with biological impacts on allelopathic interaction.	2017	Physiol Plant	Phytocassanes and momilactones are known as major diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs), characterized by abundant production and antimicrobial activity, and their biosynthetic genes are clustered in rice genomes. The basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsTGAP1 is known to act as a regulator of the coordinated production of DPs in cultured rice cells, but in planta functions of OsTGAP1 remain largely unknown. Here, we present evidence on the biological function of OsTGAP1 in planta. In wild-type plants, OsTGAP1 is abundantly expressed in roots compared with that in shoots. Moreover, the inductive expression of OsTGAP1 under jasmonic acid (JA) treatment was only observed in a root-specific manner consistent with the JA-inducible expressions of DP biosynthetic genes in roots. In reverse genetic approaches on OsTGAP1-overexpressing and OsTGAP1-knockdown plants, expressions of the biosynthetic genes relevant for DP accumulation were found to be remarkably increased and decreased, respectively. Reporter analysis in planta revealed that OsTGAP1 activated the promoters of OsDXS3 and momilactone biosynthetic gene OsKSL4, presumably through binding to the TGACGT motif. Furthermore, cocultivation experiments with barnyard grass suggested that the allelopathic effect of knockdown and overexpression of OsTGAP1 was significantly changed compared with the controls. These results demonstrate that OsTGAP1 positively regulates DP accumulation via the transcriptional regulation of DP biosynthetic genes in rice roots, and this is indispensable for maintaining allelopathic interactions with paddy weeds by regulating the production of specialized metabolites like momilactones.
28699078	Characterization of AKR4C15, a Novel Member of Aldo-Keto Reductase, in Comparison with Other Rice AKR(s).	2017	Protein J	Environmental stresses often cause a rapid and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the toxicity of which is further amplified by downstream aldehyde production. Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) is a group of enzymes metabolizing aldehyde/ketone to the corresponding alcohol using NADPH as the cofactor. In this study, OsI_20197 (AKR4C15), a novel member of AKR4 subfamily C, was isolated and biochemically characterized. Kinetic studies on bacterially-expressed recombinant AKR4C15 revealed that the enzyme was capable of metabolizing a wide variety of aldehydes but clearly exhibited a preference for three carbon compounds, i.e. methylglyoxal, malondialdehyde and glyceraldehyde. In comparison with His-tagged proteins of AKR4C9 from Arabidopsis and several other rice AKR(s): OsI_04426, OsI_04428, OsI_04429, and OsI_15387, AKR4C15 was the one capable of most efficiently metabolizing MDA and had the highest value of catalytic efficiency, which was higher than the value of AKR4C9, approximately, by 30-fold; while its capability of metabolizing MG was on par with AKR4C9, OsI_04426 and OsI_04428 (AKR4C14); and was considerably higher than the activity of OsI_04429 and OsI_15387. In vivo research on transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings ectopically-expressing AKR4C15 showed that the levels of both MDA and MG were also significantly lower than the levels in wild-type seedlings under both normal and stress conditions, emphasizing the role of AKR4C15 in MG and MDA metabolism. In conclusion, AKR4C15, together with OsI_04426 and AKR4C14, may play protective roles against small reactive aldehydes and medium-chain aldehydes.
28846681	Genome-wide analysis of DUF221 domain-containing gene family in Oryza species and identification of its salinity stress-responsive members in rice.	2017	PLoS One	DUF221 domain-containing genes (DDP genes) play important roles in developmental biology, hormone signalling transduction, and responses to abiotic stress. Therefore to understand their structural and evolutionary relationship, we did a genome-wide analysis of this important gene family in rice. Further, through comparative genomics, DDP genes from Oryza sativa subsp. (indica), nine different wild species of rice and Arabidopsis were also identified. We also found an expansion of the DDP gene families in rice and Arabidopsis which is due to the segmental duplication events in some of the gene family members. In general, a highly purifying selection was found acting on all the deduced paralogous and orthologous DDP gene pairs. The data from microarray and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis revealed that although several OsDDPs were differentially regulated under salinity stress, yet OsDDP6 was upregulated at all the developmental stages in salt tolerant rice genotype, FL478. Interestingly, OsDDP6 was found to be involved in proline metabolism pathway as indicated by protein network analysis. The diverse gene structures, varied transmembrane topologies and the differential expression patterns implied the functional diversity in DDP genes. Therefore, the comprehensive evolutionary analysis of DDP genes from different Oryza species and Arabidopsis performed in this study will provide the basis for further functional validation studies vis-à-vis DDP genes of rice and other plant species.
28801565	Dual gene expression cassette is superior than single gene cassette for enhancing sheath blight tolerance in transgenic rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Sheath blight, caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, is a serious and destructive disease of the rice. In order to improve sheath blight resistance, we developed three different kinds of transgenic rice lines. The first transgenic line overexpresses the rice chitinase gene (OsCHI11); the second contains the Arabidopsis NPR1 (AtNPR1) gene and, the third has pyramided constructs with both the genes (OsCHI11 and AtNPR1). This is a comparative study between the single-gene transgenic lines and the double gene transgenic in terms of their ability to activate the plant defense system. Rice plants of each individual construct were screened via PCR, Southern hybridization, activity assays, and expression analysis. The best transgenic lines of each construct were chosen for comparative study. The fold change in qRT-PCR and activity assays revealed that the pyramided transgenic rice plants show a significant upregulation of defense-related genes, PR genes, and antioxidant marker genes as compared to the single transgene. Simultaneous co-expression of both the genes was found to be more efficient in tolerating oxidative stress. In R. solani (RS) toxin assay, mycelial agar disc bioassay, and in vivo plant bioassay, pyramided transgenic plant lines were more competent at restricting the pathogen development and enhancing sheath blight tolerance as compared to single gene transformants.
28827170	Modulation of ABA Signaling by Altering VxGΦL Motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa.	2017	Mol Plant	The abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2CAs) in plants. In the presence of ABA, PP2Cs release stress/ABA-activated protein kinases by binding to ABA-bound receptors (PYL/RCARs) for activation. Although the wedging tryptophan in PP2Cs is critical in the interaction with PYL/RCARs in Arabidopsis and rice, it remains elusive as to how other interface regions are involved in the interaction. Here, we report the identification of a conserved region on PP2Cs, termed the VxGΦL motif, which modulates the interaction with PYL/RCARs through its second and fourth residues. The effects of the second and fourth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis. One OsPP2C50 mutant, VFGML ("FM") mutant, lowered the affinity to OsPYL/RCAR3 by ∼15-fold in comparison with the wild-type. Comparison of the crystal structures of wild-type OsPP2C50:ABA:OsPYL/RCAR3 with those composed of FM mutant revealed local conformational changes near the VxGΦL motif, further supported by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. In rice protoplasts, ABA signaling was altered by mutations in the VxGΦL motif. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM showed altered ABA sensitivity. Taken together, the VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs appears to modulate the affinity of PP2Cs with PYL/RCARs and thus likely to alter the ABA signaling, leading to the differential sensitivity to ABA in planta.
28766720	Molecular characterization of rice arsenic-induced RING finger E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2) and its heterogeneous overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2017	Physiol Plant	Arsenic (As) accumulation adversely affects the growth and productivity of plants and poses a serious threat to human health and food security. In this study, we identified one As-responsive Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase gene from rice root tissues during As stress. We named it Oryza sativa As-Induced RING E3 ligase 2 (OsAIR2). Expression of OsAIR2 was induced under various abiotic stress conditions, including heat, salt, drought and As exposure. Results of an in vitro ubiquitination assay showed that OsAIR2 possesses an E3 ligase activity. Within the cell, OsAIR2 was found to be localized to the Golgi apparatus. Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT) protein was identified as an interaction partner. We found that the O. sativa KAT1 (OsKAT1) is localized to the cytosol and peroxisomes. Moreover, in vitro pull-down assay verified the physical interaction between OsAIR2 and OsKAT1. Interestingly, in vitro ubiquitination assay and in vivo proteasomal degradation assay revealed that OsAIR2 ubiquitinates OsKAT1 and promotes the degradation of OsKAT1 via the 26S proteasome degradation pathway. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsAIR2 in Arabidopsis improved the seed germination and increased the root length under arsenate stress conditions. Therefore, these results suggest that OsAIR2 may be associated with the plant response to As stress and acts as a positive regulator of As stress tolerance.
28775143	OsbZIP48, a HY5 transcription factor ortholog, exerts pleiotropic effects in light-regulated development.	2017	Plant Physiol	Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signalling components to regulate their development. Among the light signalling components identified till date, HY5, a bZIP transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis, a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we could identify three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in monocots analysed. Out of the three homologs identified in rice, we have functionally characterized OsbZIP48. OsbZIP48 was able to complement Athy5 mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark grown rice and Athy5 seedlings complemented with OsbZIP48, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison to AtHY5, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when over-expressed in Arabidopsis, the over-expression of full-length OsbZIP48 in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that OsKO2, which encodes ent-kaurene oxidase 2 of GA biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in OsbZIP48OE and up-regulated in OsbZIP48KD transgenics as compared to the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 directly binds to the OsKO2 promoter. The RNAi lines and T-DNA insertional mutant of OsbZIP48 showed seedling lethal phenotype despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development. These data provide credible evidences that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison to its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.
28783252	The polyketide synthase OsPKS2 is essential for pollen exine and Ubisch body patterning in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Lipid and phenolic metabolism are important for pollen exine formation. In Arabidopsis, polyketide synthases (PKSs) are essential for both sporopollenin biosynthesis and exine formation. Here, we characterized the role of a polyketide synthase (OsPKS2) in male reproduction of rice (Oryza sativa). Recombinant OsPKS2 catalyzed the condensation of fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA to generate triketide and tetraketide α-pyrones, the main components of pollen exine. Indeed, the ospks2 mutant had defective exine patterning and was male sterile. However, the mutant showed no significant reduction in sporopollenin accumulation. Compared with the WT (wild type), ospks2 displayed unconfined and amorphous tectum and nexine layers in the exine, and less organized Ubisch bodies. Like the pksb/lap5 mutant of the Arabidopsis ortholog, ospks2 showed broad alterations in the profiles of anther-related phenolic compounds. However, unlike pksb/lap5, in which most detected phenolics were substantially decreased, ospks2 accumulated higher levels of phenolics. Based on these results and our observation that OsPKS2 is unable to fully restore the exine defects in the pksb/lap5, we propose that PKS proteins have functionally diversified during evolution. Collectively, our results suggest that PKSs represent a conserved and diversified biochemical pathway for anther and pollen development in higher plants.
28816596	Expression profiling of development related genes in rice plants ectopically expressing AtTOR.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Expression analysis of genes associated with development at different growth stages such as shoot apical meristem (SAM), root apical meristem (RAM), shoot and root tissues 10 DAG, flowers and grains of 2 high expression transgenic lines of rice ectopically expressing AtTOR revealed the involvement of AtTOR in transcriptional regulation of these genes. We have observed that in the SAM of these 2 selected lines, TR-2.24 and TR-15.1, OsFON1 and OsFON4 (orthologs of AtCLV1 and AtCLV3, respectively), OsKNOX2, OsKNOX3 and OsWOX3 became upregulated. The upregulation of OsFON1 and OsFON4 is likely to be involved in the maintenance of effective meristem size of the inflorescence and phyllotaxis. The grains and spikes of transgenic plants exhibited enhanced transcript levels of OsMADS1, OsMADS6, and OsMADS29 further implicating the role of TOR in modulating the expression of the genes in rice grain formation and development. Moreover, the upregulation of auxin transporter, PIN1c in RAM and roots derived from seedlings 10 DAG showed the involvement of TOR in root development. The seeds of 2 high expression lines also showed increased expression of OSE2 and GAMYB transcription factors involved in seed development. In summary, the present study, by heterologous expression of AtTOR in rice, demonstrated the involvement of TOR in regulating genes involved in various growth and developmental stages of rice plant and also in photosynthesis, productivity related functions and water-use efficiency.
28839256	Activation-tagging in indica rice identifies a novel transcription factor subunit, NF-YC13 associated with salt tolerance.	2017	Sci Rep	Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor with three distinct NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC subunits. It plays important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. We have reported earlier on development of gain-of-function mutants in an indica rice cultivar, BPT-5204. Now, we screened 927 seeds from 70 Ac/Ds plants for salinity tolerance and identified one activation-tagged salt tolerant DS plant (DS-16, T3 generation) that showed enhanced expression of a novel 'histone-like transcription factor' belonging to rice NF-Y subfamily C and was named as OsNF-YC13. Localization studies using GFP-fusion showed that the protein is localized to nucleus and cytoplasm. Real time expression analysis confirmed upregulation of transcript levels of OsNF-YC13 during salt treatment in a tissue specific manner. Biochemical and physiological characterization of the DS-16 revealed enhanced K+/Na+ ratio, proline content, chlorophyll content, enzymes with antioxidant activity etc. DS-16 also showed transcriptional up-regulation of genes that are involved in salinity tolerance. In-silico analysis of OsNF-YC13 promoter region evidenced the presence of various key stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements. OsNF-YC13 subunit alone does not appear to have the capacity for direct transcription activation, but appears to interact with the B- subunits in the process of transactivation.
28811563	Crosstalk between diurnal rhythm and water stress reveals an altered primary carbon flux into soluble sugars in drought-treated rice leaves.	2017	Sci Rep	Plants retain rhythmic physiological responses when adapting to environmental challenges. However, possible integrations between drought conditions and those responses have not received much focus, especially regarding crop plants, and the relationship between abiotic stress and the diurnal cycle is generally not considered. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify genes showing both diurnal regulation and water-deficiency response in rice (Oryza sativa). Among the 712 drought-responsive genes primary identified, 56.6% are diurnally expressed while 47.6% of the 761 that are down-regulated by drought are also diurnal. Using the β-glucuronidase reporter system and qRT-PCR analyses, we validated expression patterns of two candidate genes, thereby supporting the reliability of our transcriptome data. MapMan analysis indicated that diurnal genes up-regulated by drought are closely associated with the starch-sucrose pathway while those that are down-regulated are involved in photosynthesis. We then confirmed that starch-sucrose contents and chlorophyll fluorescence are altered in a diurnal manner under drought stress, suggesting these metabolic diurnal alterations as a novel indicator to evaluate the drought response in rice leaves. We constructed a functional gene network associated with the starch-sucrose KEGG metabolic pathway for further functional studies, and also developed a regulatory pathway model that includes OsbZIP23 transcription factor.
28821952	Genome-wide association study and gene set analysis for understanding candidate genes involved in salt tolerance at the rice seedling stage.	2017	Mol Genet Genomics	Salt is the major factor limiting crop productivity in saline soils and is controlled by various genes. The development of salt-tolerant rice through molecular breeding methods is important to meet the needs of rice breeding. We used 295 accessions to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of salt tolerance-related phenotypes in rice at the seedling stage and obtained 93 candidate genes with high association peaks across six phenotypes. We constructed a protein interaction network using the candidate genes identified here, and 33 genes were associated. Based on the expression patterns, we found that most of these genes showed a different expression level under control and salt stress conditions. In addition, haplotype network and sequence analysis of one 'key' gene, a transcription factor (Os12g0176700) encoding a SWIRM domain-containing protein, in the interaction network was investigated to explore its possible role in the network. Our study revealed candidate salt tolerance-related genes in rice at the seedling stage, and demonstrated the feasibility of using GWAS to identify genetic architecture underlying salt tolerance. The data generated here may provide resources for molecular breeding and functional analysis of salt tolerance in rice seedlings.
28776570	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	2017	Cell Res	Achieving increased grain productivity has long been the overriding focus of cereal breeding programs. The ideotype approach has been used to improve rice yield potential at the International Rice Research Institute and in China. However, the genetic basis of yield-related traits in rice remains unclear. Here, we show that a major quantitative trait locus, qNPT1, acts through the determination of a 'new plant type' (NPT) architecture characterized by fewer tillers, sturdier culms and larger panicles, and it encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with homology to human OTUB1. Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice. Unlike human OTUB1, OsOTUB1 can cleave both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14. OsOTUB1 and OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14. Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture. We also demonstrated that pyramiding of high-yielding npt1 and dep1-1 alleles provides a new strategy for increasing rice yield potential above what is currently achievable.
28546542	Low-cesium rice: mutation in OsSOS2 reduces radiocesium in rice grains.	2017	Sci Rep	In Japan, radiocesium contamination in foods has become of great concern and it is a primary issue to reduce grain radiocesium concentration in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report a low-cesium rice mutant 1 (lcs1) with the radiocesium concentration in grain about half that in the wild-type cultivar. Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in OsSOS2, which encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase required for the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway in plants, is responsible for the decreased cesium (Cs) concentrations in lcs1. Physiological analyses showed that Cs+ uptake by lcs1 roots was significantly decreased under low-potassium (K+) conditions in the presence of sodium (Na+) (low K+/Na+). The transcript levels of several K+ and Na+ transporter genes, such as OsHAK1, OsHAK5, OsAKT1, and OsHKT2;1 were significantly down-regulated in lcs1 grown at low K+/Na+. The decreased Cs+ uptake in lcs1 might be closely related to the lower expression of these genes due to the K+/Na+ imbalance in the lcs1 roots caused by the OsSOS2 mutation. Since the lcs1 plant had no significant negative effects on agronomic traits when grown in radiocesium-contaminated paddy fields, this mutant could be used directly in agriculture for reducing radiocesium in rice grains.
28540586	Leaf photosynthetic rate and mesophyll cell anatomy changes during ontogenesis in backcrossed indica × japonica rice inbred lines.	2017	Photosynth Res	The high-yielding indica rice variety, 'Takanari', has the high rate of leaf photosynthesis compared with the commercial japonica varieties. Among backcrossed inbred lines from a cross between 'Takanari' and a japonica variety, 'Koshihikari', two lines, BTK-a and BTK-b, showed approximately 20% higher photosynthetic rate than that of 'Takanari' for a flag leaf at full heading. This is a highest recorded rate of rice leaf photosynthesis. Here, the timing and cause of the increased leaf photosynthesis in the BTK lines were investigated by examining the photosynthesis and related parameters, as well as mesophyll cell anatomy during ontogenesis. Their photosynthetic rate was greater than that of 'Takanari' in the 13th leaf, as well as the flag leaf, but there were no differences in the 7th and 10th leaves. There were no consistent differences in the stomatal conductance, or the leaf nitrogen and Rubisco contents in the 13th and flag leaves. The total surface area of mesophyll cells per leaf area (TAmes) in the 13th and flag leaves increased significantly in the BTK lines due to the increased number and developed lobes of mesophyll cells compared with in 'Takanari'. The mesophyll conductance (g m) became greater in the BTK lines compared with 'Takanari' in the flag leaves but not in the 10th leaves. A close correlation was observed between TAmes and g m. We concluded that the increased mesophyll conductance through the development of mesophyll cells during the reproductive period is a probable cause of the greater photosynthetic rate in the BTK lines.

28512299	Transgenic Bt rice lines producing Cry1Ac, Cry2Aa or Cry1Ca have no detrimental effects on Brown Planthopper and Pond Wolf Spider.	2017	Sci Rep	Transgenic rice expressing cry genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt rice) is highly resistant to lepidopteran pests. The brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) is the main non-target sap-sucking insect pest of Bt transgenic rice. The pond wolf spider (PWS, Pardosa pseudoannulata) is one of the most dominant predators of BPH in rice fields. Consequently, the safety evaluation of Bt rice on BPH and PWS should be conducted before commercialization. In the current study, two experiments were performed to assess the potential ecological effects of Bt rice on BPH and PWS: (1) a tritrophic experiment to evaluate the transmission of Cry1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca protein in the food chain; and (2) binding assays of Cry1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca to midgut brush border membrane proteins from BPH and PWS. Trace amounts of the three Cry proteins were detected in BPH feeding on Bt rice cultivars, but only Cry1Ac and Cry2Aa proteins could be transferred to PWS through feeding on BPH. In vitro binding of biotinylated Cry proteins and competition assays in midgut protein vesicles showed weak binding, and ligand blot analysis confirmed the binding specificity. Thus, we inferred that the tested Bt rice varieties have negligible effects on BPH and PWS.
28542427	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of qTAC8, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	PLoS One	Rice tiller angle is an important agronomic trait that contributes to crop production and plays a vital role in high yield breeding. In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of a glabrous tropical japonica rice D50 and an indica rice HB277, was used to investigate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rice tiller angle. Two major QTLs, qTAC8 and qTAC9, were detected. While qTAC9 mapped with a previously identified gene (TAC1), using a BC2F2 population qTAC8 was mapped to a 16.5 cM region between markers RM7049 and RM23175. Position of qTAC8 was narrowed to a 92 kb DNA region by two genetic segregating populations. Finally, one opening reading frame (ORF) was regarded as a candidate gene according to genomic sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis. In addition, a set of four near isogenic lines (NILs) were created to investigate the genetic relationship between those two QTLs, and one line carrying qTAC8 and qTAC9 presented additive effect of tiller angle, suggesting that these QTLs are involved in different genetic pathways. Our results provide a foundation for the cloning of qTAC8 and genetic improvement of the rice plant architecture.
28672893	Anthocyanins from black rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) promote immune responses in leukemia through enhancing phagocytosis of macrophages <i>in vivo</i>.	2017	Exp Ther Med	Rice is a staple food in numerous countries around the world. Anthocyanins found in black rice have been reported to reduce the risk of certain diseases, but the effects of crude extract of anthocyanins from Asia University-selected purple glutinous indica rice (AUPGA) on immune responses have not yet been demonstrated. The current study aimed to investigate whether AUPGA treatment could affect immune responses in murine leukemia cells in vivo. Murine acute myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells were intraperitoneally injected into normal BALB/c mice to generate leukemia mice. A total of 50 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=10 in each group) and were fed a diet supplemented with AUPGA at 0, 20, 50 or 100 mg/kg for three weeks. All mice were weighed and the blood, liver and spleen were collected for further experiments. The results indicated that AUPGA did not significantly affect animal body weight, but significantly increased spleen weight (P<0.05) and decreased liver weight (P<0.05) when compared with the control group. AUPGA significantly increased the T cell (CD3) population at treatments of 20 and 100 mg/kg (P<0.05). However, it only significantly increased the B cell (CD19) population at a treatment of 20 mg/kg (P<0.05). Furthermore, AUPGA at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly increased the monocyte (CD11b) population and the level of macrophages (Mac-3; P<0.05 for both). AUPGA at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly promoted macrophage phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P<0.05), and all doses of AUPGA treatment significantly promoted macrophage phagocytotic activity in the peritoneum (P<0.05). AUPGA treatment significantly decreased natural killer cell activity from splenocytes (P<0.05). Finally, AUPGA treatment at 20 mg/kg treatment significantly promoted T cell proliferation (P<0.05), and treatment at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly decreased B cell proliferation compared with the control group (P<0.05).
28481332	A single-nucleotide polymorphism causes smaller grain size and loss of seed shattering during African rice domestication.	2017	Nat Plants	Grain size is one of the most important components of grain yield and selecting large seeds has been a main target during plant domestication. Surprisingly, the grain of African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) typically is smaller than that of its progenitor, Oryza barthii. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a quantitative trait locus, GL4, controlling the grain length on chromosome 4 in African rice, which regulates longitudinal cell elongation of the outer and inner glumes. Interestingly, GL4 also controls the seed shattering phenotype like its orthologue SH4 gene in Asian rice. Our data show that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in the GL4 gene resulted in a premature stop codon and led to small seeds and loss of seed shattering during African rice domestication. These results provide new insights into diverse domestication practices in African rice, and also pave the way for enhancing crop yield to meeting the challenge of cereal demand in West Africa.

28371825	Essential Role of Sugar Transporter OsSWEET11 During the Early Stage of Rice Grain Filling.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	This study investigated the role of the sugar transporter OsSWEET11 during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using β-glucoronidase (GUS) to represent its expression, together with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9)-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses. The results showed that OsSWEET11 was expressed strongly in developing caryopsis, particularly in the ovular vascular trace, nucellar epidermis and cross cells. The knockout of OsSWEET11 significantly decreased the sucrose concentration in the mutant embryo sacs and led to defective grain filling compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plant. Moreover, the expression of 2,549 genes in the mutant caryopsis was affected. The grain weight and seed setting percentage were also decreased in the mutants. The cross-fertilization of the mutant and WT rice revealed that the mutated maternal donor induced defective grain filling. These results strongly suggested that OsSWEET11 played an important role in sucrose release from maternal tissue to the maternal-filial interface during the early stage of caryopsis development. It might also induce sucrose release from the ovular vascular trace and cross cells of developing caryopsis. These findings bridge the gap in the understanding of post-phloem sugar transport during the early stage of rice caryopsis development.
28464384	Higher yields and lower methane emissions with new rice cultivars.	2017	Glob Chang Biol	Breeding high-yielding rice cultivars through increasing biomass is a key strategy to meet rising global food demands. Yet, increasing rice growth can stimulate methane (CH4 ) emissions, exacerbating global climate change, as rice cultivation is a major source of this powerful greenhouse gas. Here, we show in a series of experiments that high-yielding rice cultivars actually reduce CH4 emissions from typical paddy soils. Averaged across 33 rice cultivars, a biomass increase of 10% resulted in a 10.3% decrease in CH4 emissions in a soil with a high carbon (C) content. Compared to a low-yielding cultivar, a high-yielding cultivar significantly increased root porosity and the abundance of methane-consuming microorganisms, suggesting that the larger and more porous root systems of high-yielding cultivars facilitated CH4 oxidation by promoting O2 transport to soils. Our results were further supported by a meta-analysis, showing that high-yielding rice cultivars strongly decrease CH4 emissions from paddy soils with high organic C contents. Based on our results, increasing rice biomass by 10% could reduce annual CH4 emissions from Chinese rice agriculture by 7.1%. Our findings suggest that modern rice breeding strategies for high-yielding cultivars can substantially mitigate paddy CH4 emission in China and other rice growing regions.
28368237	Assessment of the Virulence Spectrum and Its Association with Genetic Diversity in Magnaporthe oryzae Populations from Sub-Saharan Africa.	2017	Phytopathology	A collection of 122 isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae, from nine sub-Saharan African countries, was assessed for virulence diversity and genetic relatedness. The virulence spectrum was assessed by pathotype analysis with a panel of 43 rice genotypes consisting of differential lines carrying 24 blast resistance genes (R-genes), contemporary African rice cultivars, and susceptible checks. The virulence spectrum among isolates ranged from 5 to 80%. Five isolates were avirulent to the entire rice panel, while two isolates were virulent to ∼75% of the panel. Overall, cultivar 75-1-127, the Pi9 R-gene donor, was resistant to all isolates (100%), followed by four African rice cultivars (AR105, NERICA 15, 96%; NERICA 4, 91%; and F6-36, 90%). Genetic relatedness of isolates was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from genotyping-by-sequencing and by vegetative compatibility tests. Phylogenetic analysis of SNPs of a subset of isolates (n = 78) revealed seven distinct clades that differed in virulence. Principal component analysis showed isolates from East Africa were genetically distinct from those from West Africa. Vegetative compatibility tests of a subset of isolates (n = 65) showed no common groups among countries. This study shows that blast disease could be controlled by pyramiding of Pi9 together with other promising R-genes into rice cultivars that are adapted to East and West African regions.
28466470	An osmotin from the resurrection plant Tripogon loliiformis (TlOsm) confers tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in transgenic rice.	2017	Physiol Plant	Osmotin is a key protein associated with abiotic and biotic stress response in plants. In this study, an osmotin from the resurrection plant Tripogon loliiformis (TlOsm) was characterized and functionally analyzed under abiotic stress conditions in T. loliiformis as well as in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Oryza sativa (rice) plants. Real-time PCR analysis on mixed elicitor cDNA libraries from T. loliiformis showed that TlOsm was upregulated a 1000-fold during the early stages of osmotic stresses (cold, drought, and salinity) in both shoots and roots but downregulated in shoots during heat stress. There was no change in TlOsm gene expression in roots of heat-stressed plants and during plant development. The plasma membrane localization of TlOsm was showed in fluorescent-tagged TlOsm tobacco plants using confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis. Transgenic rice plants expressing TlOsm were assessed for enhanced tolerance to salinity, drought and cold stresses. Constitutively expressed TlOsm in transgenic rice plants showed increased tolerance to cold, drought and salinity stress when compared with the wild-type and vector control counterparts. This was evidenced by maintained growth, retained higher water content and membrane integrity, and improved survival rate of TlOsm-expressing plants. The results thus indicate the involvement of TlOsm in plant response to multiple abiotic stresses, possibly through the signaling pathway, and highlight its potential applications for engineering crops with improved tolerance to cold, drought and salinity stress.
28499068	MutMapPlus identified novel mutant alleles of a rice starch branching enzyme IIb gene for fine-tuning of cooked rice texture.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Physicochemical properties of storage starch largely determine rice grain quality and food characteristics. Therefore, modification of starch property is effective to fine-tune cooked rice textures. To obtain new resources with modified starch property as breeding materials, we screened a mutant population of a japonica cultivar Nipponbare and found two independent mutant lines, altered gelatinization (age)1 and age2, with moderate changes in starch gelatinization property. A combination of conventional genetic analyses and the latest mapping method, MutMapPlus, revealed that both of these lines harbour novel independent mutant alleles of starch branching enzyme IIb (BEIIb) gene. In age1, amino acid substitution of Met-723 to Lys completely abolished BEIIb enzyme activity without significant reduction in its protein level. A transposon insertion in an intron of BEIIb gene reduced BEIIb protein level and activity in age2. Production of a series of the mutant lines by combining age alleles and indica-type starch synthase IIa allele established stepwise alteration of the physicochemical properties of starch including apparent amylose content, thermal property, digestibility by α-amylase and branched structures of amylopectin. Consistent with the alteration of starch properties, the results of a sensory evaluation test demonstrated that warm cooked rice of the mutants showed a variety of textures without marked reduction in overall palatability. These results suggest that a series of the mutant lines are capable of manipulation of cooked rice textures.
28500411	A hairy-leaf gene, BLANKET LEAF, of wild Oryza nivara increases photosynthetic water use efficiency in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: High water use efficiency is essential to water-saving cropping. Morphological traits that affect photosynthetic water use efficiency are not well known. We examined whether leaf hairiness improves photosynthetic water use efficiency in rice.

RESULTS: A chromosome segment introgression line (IL-hairy) of wild Oryza nivara (Acc. IRGC105715) with the genetic background of Oryza sativa cultivar 'IR24' had high leaf pubescence (hair). The leaf hairs developed along small vascular bundles. Linkage analysis in BC5F2 and F3 populations showed that the trait was governed by a single gene, designated BLANKET LEAF (BKL), on chromosome 6. IL-hairy plants had a warmer leaf surface in sunlight, probably due to increased boundary layer resistance. They had a lower transpiration rate under moderate and high light intensities, resulting in higher photosynthetic water use efficiency.

CONCLUSION: Introgression of BKL on chromosome 6 from O. nivara improved photosynthetic water use efficiency in the genetic background of IR24.
28830102	Transcriptional regulatory network of WOX11 is involved in the control of crown root development, cytokinin signals, and redox in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	The rice root system is mainly composed of post-embryonic shoot-borne roots called crown roots. WOX11, encoding a WUSCHEL-related homeobox domain transcription factor, is a key regulator of crown root growth and development in rice (Oryza sativa. L). In addition to specifically activating crown root development, WOX11 is also involved in lateral root initiation, root hair formation, and abiotic stresses. However, the gene regulatory network downstream of WOX11 remains largely unknown. Here, we studied the transcriptome of wox11 root tips by RNA-Seq and determined direct WOX11-binding targets by bioinformatic and biochemical analysis. The transcriptomic analysis revealed 664 differentially expressed genes, which covered a wide range of functions related to root development, cytokinin homeostasis/signaling, stress response, and redox metabolic processes. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed that the WOX11-binding motif was distributed over 41% (273/664) of the differentially expressed genes, and was mostly enriched in the promoter and intron regions. We used qRT-PCR and/or in situ hybridization to confirm co-expression of some of the WOX11-regulated genes in crown root development. We also used electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-WOX11 antibody to validate direct regulation of these genes by WOX11. The analysis identified several genes that acted downstream of WOX11 in controlling crown root formation, cytokinin signaling, stress response, and redox metabolism. This work built a hierarchical regulatory model of WOX11 in rice crown root development.
28555430	Effect of gene order in DNA constructs on gene expression upon integration into plant genome.	2017	3 Biotech	Several plant biotechnology applications are based on the expression of multiple genes located on a single transformation vector. The principles of stable expression of foreign genes in plant cells include integration of full-length gene fragments consisting of promoter and transcription terminator sequences, and avoiding converging orientation of the gene transcriptional direction. Therefore, investigators usually generate constructs in which genes are assembled in the same orientation. However, no specific information is available on the effect of the order in which genes should be assembled in the construct to support optimum expression of each gene upon integration in the genome. While many factors, including genomic position and the integration structure, could affect gene expression, the investigators judiciously design DNA constructs to avoid glitches. However, the gene order in a multigene assembly remains an open question. This study addressed the effect of gene order in the DNA construct on gene expression in rice using a simple design of two genes placed in two possible orders with respect to the genomic context. Transgenic rice lines containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) genes in two distinct orders were developed by Cre-lox-mediated site-specific integration. Gene expression analysis of transgenic lines showed that both genes were expressed at similar levels in either orientation, and different transgenic lines expressed each gene within 1-2× range. Thus, no significant effect of the gene order on gene expression was found in the transformed rice lines containing precise site-specific integrations and stable gene expression in plant cells could be obtained with altered gene orders. Therefore, gene orientation and integration structures are more important factors governing gene expression than gene orders in the genomic context.
28469237	Sequencing and de novo assembly of a near complete indica rice genome.	2017	Nat Commun	A high-quality reference genome is critical for understanding genome structure, genetic variation and evolution of an organism. Here we report the de novo assembly of an indica rice genome Shuhui498 (R498) through the integration of single-molecule sequencing and mapping data, genetic map and fosmid sequence tags. The 390.3 Mb assembly is estimated to cover more than 99% of the R498 genome and is more continuous than the current reference genomes of japonica rice Nipponbare (MSU7) and Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10). We annotate high-quality protein-coding genes in R498 and identify genetic variations between R498 and Nipponbare and presence/absence variations by comparing them to 17 draft genomes in cultivated rice and its closest wild relatives. Our results demonstrate how to de novo assemble a highly contiguous and near-complete plant genome through an integrative strategy. The R498 genome will serve as a reference for the discovery of genes and structural variations in rice.
28553299	Screening of Proximal and Interacting Proteins in Rice Protoplasts by Proximity-Dependent Biotinylation.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), which detects physiologically relevant proteins based on the proximity-dependent biotinylation process, has been successfully used in different organisms. In this report, we established the BioID system in rice protoplasts. Biotin ligase BirAG was obtained by removing a cryptic intron site in the BirA∗ gene when expressed in rice protoplasts. We found that protein biotinylation in rice protoplasts increased with increased expression levels of BirAG. The biotinylation effects can also be achieved by exogenous supplementation of high concentrations of biotin and long incubation time with protoplasts. By using this system, multiple proteins were identified that associated with and/or were proximate to OsFD2 in vivo. Our results suggest that BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment in plant cell.
28548655	An N-acetylglucosamine transporter required for arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses in rice and maize.	2017	Nat Plants	Most terrestrial plants, including crops, engage in beneficial interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Vital to the association is mutual recognition involving the release of diffusible signals into the rhizosphere. Previously, we identified the maize no perception 1 (nope1) mutant to be defective in early signalling. Here, we report cloning of ZmNope1 on the basis of synteny with rice. NOPE1 encodes a functional homologue of the Candida albicans N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transporter NGT1, and represents the first plasma membrane GlcNAc transporter identified from plants. In C. albicans, exposure to GlcNAc activates cell signalling and virulence. Similarly, in Rhizophagus irregularis treatment with rice wild-type but not nope1 root exudates induced transcriptome changes associated with signalling function, suggesting a requirement of NOPE1 function for presymbiotic fungal reprogramming.
28611791	Regional Association Analysis of MetaQTLs Delineates Candidate Grain Size Genes in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Molecular mapping studies which aim to identify genetic basis of diverse agronomic traits are vital for marker-assisted crop improvement. Numerous Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) mapped in rice span long genomic intervals with hundreds to thousands of genes, which limits their utilization for marker-assisted genetic enhancement of rice. Although potent, fine mapping of QTLs is challenging task as it requires screening of large number of segregants to identify suitable recombination events. Association mapping offers much higher resolution as compared to QTL mapping, but detects considerable number of spurious QTLs. Therefore, combined use of QTL and association mapping strategies can provide advantages associated with both these methods. In the current study, we utilized meta-analysis approach to identify metaQTLs associated with grain size/weight in diverse Indian indica and aromatic rice accessions. Subsequently, attempt has been made to narrow-down identified grain size/weight metaQTLs through individual SNP- as well as haplotype-based regional association analysis. The study identified six different metaQTL regions, three of which were successfully revalidated, and substantially scaled-down along with GS3 QTL interval (positive control) by regional association analysis. Consequently, two potential candidate genes within two reduced metaQTLs were identified based on their differential expression profiles in different tissues/stages of rice accessions during seed development. The developed strategy has broader practical utility for rapid delineation of candidate genes and natural alleles underlying QTLs associated with complex agronomic traits in rice as well as major crop plants enriched with useful genetic and genomic information.
28505081	Isolation of Rice Bran Lectins and Characterization of Their Unique Behavior in Caco-2 Cells.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Rice bran lectins, named as RBA1 and RBA2, were isolated from Oryza sativa in two chromatography steps: affinity chromatography and cation-exchange chromatography. RBA1 was found to be composed of a covalently linked heterodimer of 20- and 12-kDa subunits, and RBA2 was a noncovalently linked dimer of 12-kDa subunits. Both RBA1 and RBA2 bound to desialylated complex glycoproteins such as fetuin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and transferrin, and agalactosylated complex glycoproteins such as agalacto fetuin, agalacto-α1-acid glycoprotein, and agalacto-transferrin, in addition to chitooligosacchrides. RBAs were heat stable up to 80 °C and stable at pH 4-10. RBA1 increased the transport of the fluorescent marker, rhodamine 123, which is known to be transported via the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux pathway across human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, RBA1 itself was transported to the basolateral side of the monolayers via an endocytotic pathway.
28479230	Characterization of synthetic ecdysteroid analogues as functional mimics of brassinosteroids in plant growth.	2017	J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroidal hormones that play important roles in many stages of plant growth. Several plant species produce ecdysteroids, which are known as insect molting steroid hormones. In this study, we evaluated the biological activities of three hydroxysteroidal compounds, 20-hydroxyecdysone (ECD), 7,8-dihydro-8α-20-hydroxyecdysone (DHECD), and 7,8-dihydro-5α,8α-20-hydroxyecdysone (α-DHECD), and compared their activities with that of brassinolide (BL), the most potent BR. In rice, DHECD and α-DHECD enhanced the degree of lamina inclination, as do BRs. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DHECD and α-DHECD increased hypocotyl length in the wild-type, and also partially overcame the hypocotyl shortening in the wild-type caused by 0.3μM brassinazole, a specific BR biosynthesis inhibitor. DHECD and α-DHECD partially reduced dwarfism in the BR-biosynthesis-deficient mutant det2. Treatment with DHECD or α-DHECD downregulated the expression of the BR biosynthesis genes DWF4 and CPD, which are generally, suppressed by BR, and upregulated the expression of TCH4 and SAUR-AC1, which are generally promoted by BR. However, their regulated activities were less effective than BL. Moreover, the 10-4M DHECD and α-DHECD induced the accumulation of dephosphorylated BIL1/BZR1 that enhanced BR signaling as a master transcription factor. In contrast, ECD did not affect rice lamina bending, Arabidopsis hypocotyl elongation, the expression levels of BR-related genes and BIL1/BZR1 phosphorylation status. Based on these results, we hypothesize that both DHECD and α-DHECD have functional activities similar to those of BR.
28465621	Improved growth performance, food efficiency, and lysine availability in growing rats fed with lysine-biofortified rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Rice is an excellent source of protein, and has an adequate balance of amino acids with the exception of the essential amino acid lysine. By using a combined enhancement of lysine synthesis and suppression of its catabolism, we had produced two transgenic rice lines HFL1 and HFL2 (High Free Lysine) containing high concentration of free lysine. In this study, a 70-day rat feeding study was conducted to assess the nutritional value of two transgenic lines as compared with either their wild type (WT) or the WT rice supplemented with different concentrations of L-lysine. The results revealed that animal performance, including body weight, food intake, and food efficiency, was greater in the HFL groups than in the WT group. Moreover, the HFL diets had increased protein apparent digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and lysine availability than the WT diet. Based on the linear relationship between dietary L-lysine concentrations and animal performance, it indicated that the biological indexes of the HFL groups were similar or better than that of the WT20 group, which was supplemented with L-lysine concentrations similar to those present in the HFL diets. Therefore, lysine-biofortified rice contributed to improved growth performance, food efficiency, and lysine availability in growing rats.
28547737	08SG2/OsBAK1 regulates grain size and number, and functions differently in Indica and Japonica backgrounds in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Both grain size and grain number are significant for rice yield. In the past decade, a number of genes related to grain size and grain number have been documented, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying them remains ambiguous.

RESULTS: We identified a rice small grain (sg2) mutant in an EMS mutant library generated from an indica variety, Shuhui498. Using the MutMap gene mapping strategy, we identified two linkage regions on chromosome 7 and 8, respectively, consistent with the segregation ratios in the F2 population. We focused on the linkage region on chromosome 8, and named this locus as 08sg2. One of three SNPs identified in the linkage region was located in an exon of OsBAK1, leading to a nonsynonymous mutation in the kinase domain. The plant harboring the mutant version 08sg2 locus exhibited a decreased grain size, grain number and plant height. Cytological analysis indicated that 08SG2 regulated spikelet hull development by affecting cell proliferation. The grain size and number of knockout mutants of OsBAK1 in the japonica background were significantly decreased, but less so than in 08sg2, supporting the idea that the SNP in OsBAK1 was responsible for the 08sg2 phenotype, but that 08SG2/OsBAK1 function differently in indica and japonica backgrounds. 08sg2 was insensitive to 24-epiBL, and the expression of BR-related genes was obviously altered in 08sg2. The proportionally decreased grain length when 08sg2 and GS3 were combined indicate that 08SG2 and GS3 regulate grain length independently.

CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows that 08SG2/OsBAK1 is important for rice yield in both indica and japonica backgrounds, by regulating grain size and grain number, and the function of 08SG2/OsBAK1 is obviously affected by genetic background. The amino acid substituted in 08sg2 is highly conserved among different species, supporting the idea that it is important for the molecular function of 08SG2/OsBAK1. Together, our work is helpful for fully understanding the function of 08SG2/OsBAK1.
28500344	Quantitative trait loci for large sink capacity enhance rice grain yield under free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment conditions.	2017	Sci Rep	The global atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing annually. To determine the trait that effectively increases rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain yield under increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as predicted in the near future, we grew a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) and a near-isogenic line (NIL) producing high spikelet numbers per panicle (CSSL-GN1 and NIL-APO1, respectively) under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) conditions and examined the effects of a large sink capacity on grain yield, its components, and growth-related traits under increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Under ambient conditions, CSSL-GN1 and NIL-APO1 exhibited a similar grain yield to Koshihikari, as a result of the trade-off between increased spikelet number and reduced grain filling. However, under FACE conditions, CSSL-GN1 and NIL-APO1 had an equal or a higher grain yield than Koshihikari because of the higher number of spikelets and lower reduction in grain filling. Thus, the improvement of source activity by increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations can lead to enhanced grain yield in rice lines that have a large sink capacity. Therefore, introducing alleles that increase sink capacity into conventional varieties represents a strategy that can be used to develop high-yielding varieties under increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, such as those predicted in the near future.
28558018	Yellow-Leaf 1 encodes a magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase, involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	PLoS One	Magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase (MPEC) catalyzes the conversion of MPME to divinyl protochlorophyllide (DVpchlide). This is an essential enzyme during chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis but details of its function in rice are still lacking. Here, we identified a novel rice mutant yellow-leaf 1 (yl-1), which showed decreased Chl accumulation, abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure and attenuated photosynthetic activity. Map-based cloning and over-expression analysis suggested that YL-1 encodes a subunit of MPEC. The YL-1 protein localizes in chloroplasts, and it is mainly expressed in green tissues, with greatest abundance in leaves and young panicles. Results of qRT-PCR showed that Chl biosynthesis upstream genes were highly expressed in the yl-1 mutant, while downstream genes were compromised, indicating that YL-1 plays a pivotal role in the Chl biosynthesis. Furthermore, the expression levels of photosynthesis and chloroplast development genes were also affected. RNA-seq results futher proved that numerous membrane-associated genes, including many plastid membrane-associated genes, have altered expression pattern in the yl-1 mutant, implying that YL-1 is required for plastid membrane stability. Thus, our study confirms a putative MPME cyclase as a novel key enzyme essential for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast membrane stability in rice.
28500402	Identification and characterization of a grain micronutrient-related OsFRO2 rice gene ortholog from micronutrient-rich little millet (Panicum sumatrense).	2017	3 Biotech	Minor millets are considered as nutrient-rich cereals having significant effect in improving human health. In this study, a rice ortholog of Ferric Chelate Reductase (FRO2) gene involved in plant metal uptake has been identified in iron-rich Little millet (LM) using PCR and next generation sequencing-based strategy. FRO2 gene-specific primers designed from rice genome amplified 2.7 Kb fragment in LM genotype RLM-37. Computational genomics analyses of the sequenced amplicon showed high level sequence similarity with rice OsFRO2 gene. The predicted gene structure showed the presence of 6 exons and 5 introns and its protein sequence was found to contain ferric reductase and NOX_Duox_Like_FAD_NADP domains. Further, 3D structure analysis of FCR-LM model protein (494 amino acids) shows that it has 18 helices, 10 beta sheets, 10 strands, 41 beta turn and 5 gamma turn with slight deviation from the FCR-Os structure. Besides, the structures of FCR-LM and FCR-Os were modelled followed by molecular dynamics simulations. The overall study revealed both sequence and structural similarity between the identified gene and OsFRO2. Thus, a putative ferric chelate reductase gene has been identified in LM paving the way for using this approach for identification of orthologs of other metal genes from millets. This also facilitates mining of effective alleles of known genes for improvement of staple crops like rice.
28499072	Sequencing of bulks of segregants allows dissection of genetic control of amylose content in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Amylose content (AC) is a key quality trait in rice. A cross between Oryza glaberrima (African rice) and Oryza sativa (Asian rice) segregating for AC was analysed by sequencing bulks of individuals with high and low AC. SNP associated with the granule bound starch synthase (GBSS1) locus on chromosome 6 were polymorphic between the bulks. In particular, a G/A SNP that would result in an Asp to Asn mutation was identified. This amino acid substitution may be responsible for differences in GBSS activity as it is adjacent to a disulphide linkage conserved in all grass GBSS proteins. Other polymorphisms in genomic regions closely surrounding this variation may be the result of linkage drag. In addition to the variant in the starch biosynthesis gene, SNP on chromosomes 1 and 11 linked to AC was also identified. SNP was found in the genes encoding the NAC and CCAAT-HAP5 transcription factors that have previously been linked to starch biosynthesis. This study has demonstrated that the approach of sequencing bulks was able to identify genes on different chromosomes associated with this complex trait.
28489041	Effect of Gamma Irradiation on 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline Content, GABA Content and Volatile Compounds of Germinated Rice (Thai Upland Rice).	2017	Plants (Basel)	Aroma intensity in rice is related to the level of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). The accumulation of 2AP in rice has been synthesized via l-proline metabolism by inactive betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme (BADH2), which activates 2AP accumulation. Meanwhile, active BADH2 inhibits 2AP accumulation but activates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation. The improvement of 2AP content in rice has been reported under certain conditions, such as high salinity, water treatment, and reduction of high intensity solar exposure. In this study, we conducted the effects of gamma irradiation on 2AP content, GABA content and volatile compounds of germinated rice (Thai upland rice). Our results showed that the GABA content was highest when rice seeds germinated within a 24-h. The 2AP content of irradiated rice (germinated within a 24-h duration) was higher than non-irradiated rice for all gamma doses, particularly at 20 Gy, which showed a 23-fold higher level of 2AP than non-irradiated rice. On the other hand, the reduction of the GABA content of irradiated rice was caused by an increase in the gamma dose. At 300 Gy, irradiated rice had a GABA content approximately 2.6-fold lower than non-irradiated rice. Moreover, we observed that a reduction of volatile compounds occurred when increasing gamma dose. However, some volatile compounds appeared in the irradiated rice at gamma doses of 60 Gy, 80 Gy, 100 Gy and 300 Gy. Furthermore, we observed that the level of Octanal, which is the compound most related to aroma intensity, of irradiated rice was stronger than that of non-irradiated rice. Our results demonstrate for the first time that 2AP and GABA contents are sensitive to gamma irradiation conditions. Moreover, the results indicate that the gamma irradiation technique can be used to improve the aroma intensity of rice.
28533017	Morphological and physicochemical characterization of porous starches obtained from different botanical sources and amylolytic enzymes.	2017	Int J Biol Macromol	Porous starches might offer an attractive alternative as bio-adsorbents of a variety of compounds. However, morphology and physicochemical properties of starches must be understood before exploring their applications. Objective was to study the action of different amylolytic enzymes for producing porous starches. Wheat, rice, potato and cassava starches were treated with Amyloglucosidase (AMG), α-amylase (AM) and cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase (CGTase). Morphological characteristics, chemical composition, adsorptive capacity and pasting/thermal properties were assessed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed porous structures with diverse pore size distribution, which was dependent on the enzyme type and starch source, but no differences were observed in the total granule surface occupied by pores. The adsorptive capacity analysis revealed that modified starches had high water absorptive capacity and showed different oil adsorptive capacity depending on the enzyme type. Amylose content analysis revealed different hydrolysis pattern of the amylases, suggesting that AMG mainly affected crystalline region meanwhile AM and CGTase attacked amorphous area. A heatmap illustrated the diverse pasting properties of the different porous starches, which also showed significant different thermal properties, with different behavior between cereal and tuber starches. Therefore, it is possible to modulate the properties of starches through the use of different enzymes.
28575477	Regulation of Gene Expression in the Remobilization of Carbon Reserves in Rice Stems During Grain Filling.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Carbon reserves in rice straw (stem and sheath) before flowering contribute to a significant portion of grain filling. However, the molecular mechanism of carbon reserve remobilization from straw to grains remains unclear. In this study, super rice LYP9 and conventional rice 9311 showed different carbon reserve remobilization behaviors. The transcriptomic profiles of straws of LYP9 and 9311 were analyzed at three stages of grain filling. Among the differentially expressed genes (DGs), 5,733 genes were uniquely up- or down-regulated at 30 days after anthesis (DAA) between LYP9 and 9311 in comparison with 681 at 10 DAA and 495 at 20 DAA, suggesting that the gene expression profile of LYP9 was very different from that of 9311 at the late stage of grain filling. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) classification of DGs both showed that the carbohydrate catabolic pathway, plant hormone signal transduction and photosynthesis pathway were enriched in DGs, suggesting their roles in carbon reserve remobilization, which explains to a certain extent the difference in non-structural carbohydrate content, photosynthesis and ABA content between the two cultivars during grain filling. Further comparative analysis and confirmation by quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme assays suggest that genes involved in trehalose synthesis (trehalose-phosphate phosphatase and trehalose 6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase), starch degradation (β-amylase) and sucrose synthesis (sucrose-phosphate synthase and sucrose synthase) were important for carbon reserve remobilization, whereas ABA content was determined by the counteraction of NCED1 and ABA8ox1 genes. The higher expression level of all these genes and ABA content in 9311 resulted in better efficiency of carbon reserve remobilization in 9311 than in LYP9.
28588605	miR397/Laccase Gene Mediated Network Improves Tolerance to Fenoxaprop-<i>P</i>-ethyl in <i>Beckmannia syzigachne</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i>.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Herbicide resistance can be either target-site or non-target-site based. The molecular mechanisms underlying non-target-site resistance (NTSR) are poorly understood, especially at the level of gene expression regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent key post-transcriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression and play important roles in stress responses. In this study, the miR397 gene from Beckmannia syzigachne (referred to as bsy-miR397) was functionally characterized to determine its role in regulating fenoxaprop-P-ethyl resistance. We showed that (1) bsy-miR397 transcript level is constitutively higher in resistant than in sensitive B. syzigachne plants, whereas bsy-Laccase expression and activity show the opposite trend, and (2) bsy-miR397 suppresses the expression of bsy-Laccase in tobacco, indicating that it negatively regulates bsy-Laccase at the transcriptional level. We found evidences that miR397/laccase regulation might be involved in fenoxaprop-P-ethyl NTSR. First, the rice transgenic line overexpressing OXmiR397 showed improved fenoxaprop-P-ethyl tolerance. Second, following activation of bsy-Laccase gene expression by CuSO4 treatment, fenoxaprop resistance in B. syzigachne tended to decrease. Therefore, we suggest that bsy-miR397 might play a role in fenoxaprop-P-ethyl NTSR in B. syzigachne by down-regulating laccase expression, potentially leading to the enhanced expression of three oxidases/peroxidases genes to introduce an active moiety into herbicide molecules in Phase-2 metabolism. Bsy-miR397, bsy-Laccase, and other regulatory components might form a regulatory network to detoxify fenoxaprop-P-ethyl in B. syzigachne, supported by the differential expression of transcription factors and oxidases/peroxidases in the rice transgenic line overexpressing OXmiR397. This implies how down-regulation of a gene (laccase) can enhance NTSR. Our findings shed light on the daunting task of understanding and managing complex NTSR in weedy plant species.
28736485	Origin of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) domestication genes.	2017	Genet Resour Crop Evol	A number of genes that contribute to the domestication traits of cultivated rice have been identified. These include Sh4, Rc, PROG1 and LABA1, which are associated with non-shattering rachis, white pericarp, erect growth and barbless awns, respectively. The mutations giving rise to the "domestication alleles" of these genes are either invariable in cultivated rice, or have variability that is strictly associated with the phenotypic trait. This observation forms the basis to those current rice domestication models that envisage a single origin for the domesticated phenotype. Such models assume that the domestication alleles are absent or rare in wild rice, emerged under cultivation and spread across all rice groups by introgressive hybridization. We examined whole-genome sequencing datasets for wild and cultivated rice to test the former two assumptions. We found that the rc and laba1 alleles occur in wild rice with broad geographical distribution, and reach frequencies as high as 13 and 15%, respectively. These results are in agreement with previous observations of the prog1 and sh4 domestication alleles in wild populations. We also show that the diversity of the genomic regions surrounding the rc, laba1, prog1 and sh4 alleles in wild accessions is greater than that in cultivated rice, suggesting that these alleles emerged prior to domestication. Our findings indicate that the possibility that independent rice groups obtained identical domestication alleles directly from the wild population needs to be considered.
28588596	Evaluating Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices for Leaf Area Index Estimation of <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. at Diverse Phenological Stages.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Hyperspectral reflectance derived vegetation indices (VIs) are used for non-destructive leaf area index (LAI) monitoring for precise and efficient N nutrition management. This study tested the hypothesis that there is potential for using various hyperspectral VIs for estimating LAI at different growth stages of rice under varying N rates. Hyperspectral reflectance and crop canopy LAI measurements were carried out over 2 years (2015 and 2016) in Meichuan, Hubei, China. Different N fertilization, 0, 45, 82, 127, 165, 210, 247, and 292 kg ha-1, were applied to generate various scales of VIs and LAI values. Regression models were used to perform quantitative analyses between spectral VIs and LAI measured under different phenological stages. In addition, the coefficient of determination and RMSE were employed to evaluate these models. Among the nine VIs, the ratio vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and exhibited strong and significant relationships with the LAI estimation at different phenological stages. The enhanced vegetation index performed moderately. However, the green normalized vegetation index and blue normalized vegetation index confirmed that there is potential for crop LAI estimation at early phenological stages; the soil-adjusted vegetation index and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index were more related to the soil optical properties, which were predicted to be the least accurate for LAI estimation. The noise equivalent accounted for the sensitivity of the VIs and MSAVI, MTVI2, and NDVI for the LAI estimation at phenological stages. The results note that LAI at different crop phenological stages has a significant influence on the potential of hyperspectral derived VIs under different N management practices.
28555143	Global Transcriptome Analysis of Combined Abiotic Stress Signaling Genes Unravels Key Players in <i>Oryza sativa</i> L.: An <i>In silico</i> Approach.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Combined abiotic stress (CAbS) affects the field grown plants simultaneously. The multigenic and quantitative nature of uncontrollable abiotic stresses complicates the process of understanding the stress response by plants. Considering this, we analyzed the CAbS response of C3 model plant, Oryza sativa by meta-analysis. The datasets of commonly expressed genes by drought, salinity, submergence, metal, natural expression, biotic, and abiotic stresses were data mined through publically accessible transcriptomic abiotic stress (AbS) responsive datasets. Of which 1,175, 12,821, and 42,877 genes were commonly expressed in meta differential, individual differential, and unchanged expressions respectively. Highly regulated 100 differentially expressed AbS genes were derived through integrative meta-analysis of expression data (INMEX). Of this 30 genes were identified from AbS gene families through expression atlas that were computationally analyzed for their physicochemical properties. All AbS genes were physically mapped against O. sativa genome. Comparative mapping of these genes demonstrated the orthologous relationship with related C4 panicoid genome. In silico expression analysis of these genes showed differential expression patterns in different developmental tissues. Protein-protein interaction of these genes, represented the complexity of AbS. Computational expression profiling of candidate genes in response to multiple stresses suggested the putative involvement of OS05G0350900, OS02G0612700, OS05G0104200, OS03G0596200, OS12G0225900, OS07G0152000, OS08G0119500, OS06G0594700, and Os01g0393100 in CAbS. These potential candidate genes need to be studied further to decipher their functional roles in AbS dynamics.
28560587	Evolutionary relationships and expression analysis of EUL domain proteins in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Lectins, defined as 'Proteins that can recognize and bind specific carbohydrate structures', are widespread among all kingdoms of life and play an important role in various biological processes in the cell. Most plant lectins are involved in stress signaling and/or defense. The family of Euonymus-related lectins (EULs) represents a group of stress-related lectins composed of one or two EUL domains. The latter protein domain is unique in that it is ubiquitous in land plants, suggesting an important role for these proteins.

RESULTS: Despite the availability of multiple completely sequenced rice genomes, little is known on the occurrence of lectins in rice. We identified 329 putative lectin genes in the genome of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica belonging to nine out of 12 plant lectin families. In this paper, an in-depth molecular characterization of the EUL family of rice was performed. In addition, analyses of the promoter sequences and investigation of the transcript levels for these EUL genes enabled retrieval of important information related to the function and stress responsiveness of these lectins. Finally, a comparative analysis between rice cultivars and several monocot and dicot species revealed a high degree of sequence conservation within the EUL domain as well as in the domain organization of these lectins.

CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EULs throughout the plant kingdom and the high degree of sequence conservation in the EUL domain suggest that these proteins serve an important function in the plant cell. Analysis of the promoter region of the rice EUL genes revealed a diversity of stress responsive elements. Furthermore analysis of the expression profiles of the EUL genes confirmed that they are differentially regulated in response to several types of stress. These data suggest a potential role for the EULs in plant stress signaling and defense.
28540496	Phenotyping of VIGS-mediated gene silencing in rice using a vector derived from a DNA virus.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Target genes in rice can be optimally silenced if inserted in antisense or hairpin orientation in the RTBV-derived VIGS vector and plants grown at 28 °C and 80% humidity after inoculation. Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a method used to transiently silence genes in dicot as well as monocot plants. For the important monocot species rice, the Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV)-derived VIGS system (RTBV-VIGS), which uses agroinoculation to initiate silencing, has not been standardized for optimal use. Here, using RTBV-VIGS, three sets of conditions were tested to achieve optimal silencing of the rice marker gene phytoene desaturase (pds). The effect of orientation of the insert in the RTBV-VIGS plasmid (sense, antisense and hairpin) on the silencing of the target gene was then evaluated using rice magnesium chelatase subunit H (chlH). Finally, the rice Xa21 gene, conferring resistance against bacterial leaf blight disease (BLB) was silenced using RTBV-VIGS system. In each case, real-time PCR-based assessment indicated approximately 40-80% fall in the accumulation levels of the transcripts of pds, chlH and Xa21. In the case of pds, the appearance of white streaks in the emerging leaves, and for chlH, chlorophyll levels and F v/F m ratio were assessed as phenotypes for silencing. For Xa21, the resistance levels to BLB were assessed by measuring the lesion length and the percent diseased areas of leaves, following challenge inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae. In each case, the RTBV-MVIGS system gave rise to a discernible phenotype indicating the silencing of the respective target gene using condition III (temperature 28 °C, humidity 80% and 1 mM MES and 20 µM acetosyringone in secondary agrobacterium culture), which revealed the robustness of this gene silencing system for rice.
28526984	Reduced weed seed shattering by silencing a cultivated rice gene: strategic mitigation for escaped transgenes.	2017	Transgenic Res	Transgene flow form a genetically engineered (GE) crop to its wild relatives may result in unwanted environmental consequences. Mitigating transgenes via introducing a gene that is disadvantageous to wild relatives but beneficial to crops, and is tightly-linked with the target transgenes, may provide a promising solution to limit the spread of transgenes in wild/weedy populations. Here we demonstrate a novel system with significantly reduced seed shattering in crop-weed hybrid descendants by partially silenced expression of the seed-shattering gene SH4 in cultivated rice, using artificial microRNA and antisense RNA techniques. Accordingly, fewer seeds were found in the soil of the field plots where transgenic hybrid lineages were grown. However, no differences in productivity-related traits were detected between GE and non-GE cultivated rice. To silence seed-shattering genes provides a useful strategy to reduce the potential environmental impacts caused by transgene flow from commercial GE rice to weedy rice, in addition to the control of weedy rice.
28744184	Genetic analysis for rice seedling vigor and fine mapping of a major QTL <i>qSSL1b</i> for seedling shoot length.	2017	Breed Sci	Seedling vigor is an important agricultural trait as direct-seeded rice technology becomes widely applied. In order to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying seedling vigor in rice, seeds of 132 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 93-11 and PA64s, harvested from Lingshui and Hangzhou were cultivated in the nutrient solution, and four indices for seedling vigor were measured including seedling shoot length (SSL), seedling root length (SRL), seedling wet weight (SWW) and seedling dry weight (SDW). Significant correlations were observed among the indices, and also between 1000-seed weight (TSW) and SWW or SDW. Combined with a high-resolution genetic map generated from sequencing of the RILs, 65 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on all chromosomes with interval of 1.93 Mb on average. Among 57 QTLs for seedling vigor, 28 were detected from seeds harvested in both sites and 33 were first identified. With BC3F2 derived from 93-11 and a CSSL harboring segments from PA64s in 93-11 background, a major QTL for SSL, qSSL1b was fine mapped within 80.5 kb between two InDel markers. Our study provides a platform for further cloning of the QTL and dissecting the molecular basis for seedling vigor at early seedling stage in rice.
28371923	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Co-operatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Meristems such as the shoot apical meristem and flower meristem (FM) act as a reservoir of stem cells, which reproduce themselves and supply daughter cells for the differentiation of lateral organs. In Oryza sativa (rice), the FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) gene, which is similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA3, is involved in meristem maintenance. In fon2 mutants, the numbers of floral organs are increased due to an enlargement of the FM. To identify new factors regulating meristem maintenance in rice, we performed a genetic screening of mutants that enhanced the fon2 mutation, and found a mutant line (2B-424) in which pistil number was dramatically increased. By using a map-based approach and next-generation sequencing, we found that the line 2B-424 had a complete loss-of-function mutation (a large deletion) in OsMADS3, a class C MADS-box gene that is known to be involved in stamen specification. Disruption of OsMADS3 in the fon2 mutant by CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology caused a flower phenotype similar to that of 2B-424, confirming that the gene responsible for enhancement of fon2 was OsMADS3. Morphological analysis showed that the fon2 and osmads3 mutations synergistically affected pistil development and FM determinacy. We also found that whorl 3 was duplicated in mature flowers and the FM was enlarged at an early developmental stage in severe osmads3 single mutants. These findings suggest that OsMADS3 is involved not only in FM determinacy in late flower development but also in FM activity in early flower development.
28556941	The buffering capacity of stems: genetic architecture of nonstructural carbohydrates in cultivated Asian rice, Oryza sativa.	2017	New Phytol	Harnessing stem carbohydrate dynamics in grasses offers an opportunity to help meet future demands for plant-based food, fiber and fuel production, but requires a greater understanding of the genetic controls that govern the synthesis, interconversion and transport of such energy reserves. We map out a blueprint of the genetic architecture of rice (Oryza sativa) stem nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) at two critical developmental time-points using a subpopulation-specific genome-wide association approach on two diverse germplasm panels followed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in a biparental population. Overall, 26 QTL are identified; three are detected in multiple panels and are associated with starch-at-maturity, sucrose-at-maturity and NSC-at-heading. They tag OsHXK6 (rice hexokinase), ISA2 (rice isoamylase) and a tandem array of sugar transporters. This study provides the foundation for more in-depth molecular investigation to validate candidate genes underlying rice stem NSC and informs future comparative studies in other agronomically vital grass species.
28582731	FRET-based glucose imaging identifies glucose signalling in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice roots.	2017	J Plant Physiol	Glucose is the primary energy provider and the most important sugar-signalling molecule, regulating metabolites and modulating gene expression from unicellular yeast to multicellular plants and animals. Therefore, monitoring intracellular glucose levels temporally and spatially in living cells is an essential step for decoding the glucose signalling in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, the genetically encoded FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) nanosensors, FLIPglu-2μ∆13 and FLIPglu-600μΔ13, were used to measure cytosolic glucose dynamics in rice plants. First, we found that the FRET signal decreased in response to external glucose in a concentration-dependent manner. The glucose concentration at which the cytosolic level corresponded to the K0.5 value for FLIPglu-2μΔ13 was approximately 10.05μM, and that for FLIPglu-600μΔ13 was 0.9mM, respectively. The substrate selectivity of nanosensors for glucose and its analogues is D-Glucose>2-deoxyglucose>3-O-methylglucose>L-Glucose. We further showed that the biotic elicitors (flg22 and chitin) and the abiotic elicitors (osmotic stress, salinity and extreme temperature) induce the intracellular glucose increases in the detached root segments of transgenic rice containing FLIPglu-2μΔ13 in a stimulus-specific manner, but not in FLIPglu-600μΔ13 transgenic lines. These results demonstrated that FRET nanosensors can be used to detect increases in intracellular glucose within the physiological range of 0.2-20μM in response to various stimuli in transgenic rice root cells, which indicated that intracellular glucose may act as a potential secondary messenger to connect extracellular stimuli with cellular physiological responses in plants.
28712502	Gene Editing With TALEN and CRISPR/Cas in Rice.	2017	Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci	Engineered, site-specific nucleases induce genomic double-strand DNA breaks and break repair processes enable genome editing in a plethora of eukaryotic genomes. TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) are potent biotechnological tools used for genome editing. In rice, species-tailored editing tools have proven to be efficient and easy to use. Both tools are capable of generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo and such breaks can be repaired either by error-prone NHEJ (nonhomologous end joining) that leads to nucleotide insertions or deletions or by HDR (homology-directed repair) if an appropriate exogenous DNA template is provided. NHEJ repair often results in gene knockout, while HDR results in precise nucleotide sequence or gene replacement. In this review, we revisit the molecular mechanisms underlying DSB repair in eukaryotes and review the TALEN and CRISPR technologies (CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cpf1, and Base Editor) developed and utilized for genome editing by scientists in rice community.
28534133	Silencing of the Rice Gene LRR1 Compromises Rice Xa21 Transcript Accumulation and XA21-Mediated Immunity.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice immune receptor XA21 confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. We previously demonstrated that an auxilin-like protein, XA21 BINDING PROTEIN 21 (XB21), positively regulates resistance to Xoo.

RESULTS: To further investigate the function of XB21, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified 22 unique XB21 interacting proteins, including LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 1 (LRR1), which we selected for further analysis. Silencing of LRR1 in the XA21 genetic background (XA21-LRR1Ri) compromises resistance to Xoo compared with control XA21 plants. XA21-LRR1Ri plants have reduced Xa21 transcript levels and reduced expression of genes that serve as markers of XA21-mediated activation. Overexpression of LRR1 is insufficient to alter resistance to Xoo in rice lines lacking XA21.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that LRR1 is required for wild-type Xa21 transcript expression and XA21-mediated immunity.
28556915	A microbially derived tyrosine-sulfated peptide mimics a plant peptide hormone.	2017	New Phytol	The biotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) produces a sulfated peptide named RaxX, which shares similarity to peptides in the PSY (plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine) family. We hypothesize that RaxX mimics the growth-stimulating activity of PSY peptides. Root length was measured in Arabidopsis and rice treated with synthetic RaxX peptides. We also used comparative genomic analyses and reactive oxygen species burst assays to evaluate the activity of RaxX and PSY peptides. Here we found that a synthetic sulfated RaxX derivative comprising 13 residues (RaxX13-sY), highly conserved between RaxX and PSY, induces root growth in Arabidopsis and rice in a manner similar to that triggered by PSY. We identified residues that are required for activation of immunity mediated by the rice XA21 receptor but that are not essential for root growth induced by PSY. Finally, we showed that a Xanthomonas strain lacking raxX is impaired in virulence. These findings suggest that RaxX serves as a molecular mimic of PSY peptides to facilitate Xoo infection and that XA21 has evolved the ability to recognize and respond specifically to the microbial form of the peptide.
28487273	Cloning and functional analysis of the SiRLK35 gene in Setaria italic L.	2017	Yi Chuan	Receptor like protein kinases (RLKs) play vital roles in both plant development and stress conditions. Using drought-treated "Yugu 1" as materials, a drought-responsive RLK gene, SiRLK35, was isolated through iTRAQ analysis. In this study, the further analyses of the gene functions were carried out. First, full-length SiRLK35 was amplified by PCR using the cDNA of foxtail millet seedlings as a template. The expression patterns of SiRLK35 under NaCl, PEG, ABA, GA and MeJA treatment were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and we found that the expression of SiRLK35 could be induced under different treatments, especially under NaCl treatment. Second, the prokaryotic expression plasmid of SiRLK35 was constructed, and the salt resistance of SiRLK35 was detected by the bacterial plaque growth method. And we uncovered that the growth and tolerance of SiRLK35-containing Escherichia coli strains were in better conditions than control under the NaCl stress. Lastly, pCambia1301P-SiRLK35 was constructed and transformed into rice to obtain transgenic plants. The tolerance of transgenic rice plants to salt stress was higher than that of controls through physiological analysis. We propose that SiRLK35 may participate in salt and stress resistance processes, which could provide potential theoretical foundation for the stress resistance varieties cultivation and breeding of foxtail millet.
28493203	Dissection of broad-spectrum resistance of the Thai rice variety Jao Hom Nin conferred by two resistance genes against rice blast.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important food crops in the world. Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. To effectively cope with this problem, the use of rice blast resistance varieties through innovative breeding programs is the best strategy to date. The Thai rice variety Jao Hom Nin (JHN) showed broad-spectrum resistance against Thai rice blast isolates. Two QTLs for blast resistance in JHN were reported on chromosome 1 (QTL1) and 11 (QTL11).

RESULTS: Monogenic lines of QTL1 (QTL1-C) and QTL11 (QTL11-C) in the CO39 genetic background were generated. Cluster analysis based on the disease reaction pattern of QTL1-C and QTL11-C, together with IRBLs, showed that those two monogenic lines were clustered with IRBLsh-S (Pish) and IRBL7-M (Pi7), respectively. Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that Pish and Pi7 were embedded within the QTL1 and QTL11 delimited genomic intervals, respectively. This study thus concluded that QTL1 and QTL11 could encode alleles of Pish and Pi7, designated as Pish-J and Pi7-J, respectively. To validate this hypothesis, the genomic regions of Pish-J and Pi7-J were cloned and sequenced. Protein sequence comparison revealed that Pish-J and Pi7-J were identical to Pish and Pi7, respectively. The holistic disease spectrum of JHN was found to be exactly attributed to the additive ones of both QTL1-C and QTL11-C.

CONCLUSION: JHN showed broad spectrum resistance against Thai and Philippine rice blast isolates. As this study demonstrated, the combination of two resistance genes, Pish-J and Pi7-J, in JHN, with each controlling broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast disease, explains the high level of resistance. Thus, the combination of Pish and Pi7 can provide a practical scheme for breeding durable resistance in rice against rice blast disease.
28550206	The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress.	2017	Plant Physiol	Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B6, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as models, we show that PDX12 is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic PDX1 homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B6 biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of PDX12 transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B6 homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.
28551765	MiR529a modulates panicle architecture through regulating SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: MiR529a affects rice panicle architecture by targeting OsSPL2,OsSPL14 and OsSPL17 genes that could regulate their downstream panicle related genes. The panicle architecture determines the grain yield and quality of rice, which could be regulated by many transcriptional factors. The SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors are involved in the regulation of panicle development, which are targeted by miR156 and miR529. The expression profile demonstrated that miR529a is preferentially expressed in the early panicle of rice and it might regulate panicle development in rice. However, the regulation mechanism of miR529-SPL is still not clear. In this study, we predicted five miR529a putative target genes, OsSPL2, OsSPL14, OsSPL16, OsSPL17 and OsSPL18, while only the expression of OsSPL2, OsSPL14, and OsSPL17 was regulated by miR529a in the rice panicle. Overexpression of miR529a dramatically affected panicle architecture, which was regulated by OsSPL2, OsSPL14, and OsSPL17. Furthermore, the 117, 35, and 25 pathway genes associated with OsSPL2, OsSPL14 and OsSPL17, respectively, were predicted, and they shared 20 putative pathway genes. Our results revealed that miR529a could play a vital role in the regulation of panicle architecture through regulating OsSPL2, OsSPL14, OsSPL17 and the complex networks formed by their pathway and downstream genes. These findings will provide new genetic resources for reshaping ideal plant architecture and breeding high yield rice varieties.
28556940	Three TOB1-related YABBY genes are required to maintain proper function of the spikelet and branch meristems in rice.	2017	New Phytol	YABBY genes play important roles in the development of lateral organs such as leaves and floral organs in Angiosperms. However, the function of YABBY genes is poorly understood in monocots. We focused on three rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY genes, TONGARI-BOUSHI (TOB1, TOB2, TOB3), which are closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL). To elucidate the function of these YABBY genes, we employed a reverse genetic approach. TOB genes were expressed in bract and lateral organ primordia, but not in meristems. RNAi knockdown of TOB2 or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development. Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both TOB2 and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development. In severe cases, the inflorescences comprised naked branches without spikelets. Analysis of inflorescence development at an early stage showed that the observed phenotypic defects were closely associated with a failure to initiate and maintain reproductive meristems. These results indicate that the TOB genes regulate the maintenance and fate of all reproductive meristems. It is likely that the function of FIL/TOB clade YABBY genes has been conserved between Arabidopsis and rice to maintain the proper function of meristems, even though these genes are expressed in lateral organ primordia.
28546437	In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop.	2017	Plant Physiol	To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (Oryza sativa) and Agave tequilana Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.
28470512	Suppressive effect of microRNA319 expression on rice plant height.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: miR319 was identified as a dwarf-inducing gene from Shiokari and its dwarf near isogenic line, and its transgenic rice showed a reduced plant height. This finding reveals the potential application of miR319 in future molecular breeding. It is well known that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in plant physiology, especially in development and stress responses. However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in plant height. In this study, the rice cultivar Shiokari and its dwarf near isogenic line Shiokari-d6 were analysed to identify and characterize plant height-associated miRNAs. This anatomic and morphological investigation revealed that the major cause of the shorter height of Shiokari-d6 is the significantly dis-elongated internodes, particularly the second internode and those underneath it. The results of miRNA microarray profiling and real-time RT-PCR indicated that miR319 is expressed at a significantly higher level in Shiokari-d6 than in Shiokari. Transgenic rice overexpressing miR319 in Oryza sativa L. cv. Tainung 67 generated through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation had a stable dwarf phenotype regardless of whether the plants were from the T1 or T2 generation. We also found that the internodes of miR319-overexpressing rice are shortened, particularly the third internode and those underneath it. Furthermore, we identified three putative miR319 target genes that were previously uncharacterized with expression levels that were negatively correlated with the expression of miR319. In conclusion, miR319 is the first miRNA proposed to be involved in plant height regulation, and its function may influence the elongation of internodes, which leads to decreased plant height.
28466433	Differences in specificity and compensatory functions among three major starch synthases determine the structure of amylopectin in rice endosperm.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	The lengths of amylopectin-branched chains are precise and influence the physicochemical properties of starch, which determine starch functionality. Three major isozymes of starch synthases (SSs), SSI, SSII(a), and SSIII(a), are primarily responsible for amylopectin chain elongation in the storage tissues of plants. To date, the majority of reported rice mutants were generated using japonica cultivars, which have almost inactive SSIIa. Although three SSs share some overlapping chain length preferences, whether they complement each other remains unknown due to the absence of suitable genetic combinations of materials. In this study, rice ss1/SS2a/SS3a and SS1/SS2a/ss3a were newly generated, and the chain length distribution patterns of all the possible combinations of presence and absence of SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa activities were compared. This study demonstrated that SSIIa can complement most SSI functions that use glucan chains with DP 6-7 to generate DP 8-12 chains but cannot fully compensate for the elongation of DP 16-19 chains. This suggests that SSIIa preferentially elongates outer but not inner chains of amylopectin. In addition, the results revealed that neither SSI nor SSIIIa compensate for SSIIa. Neither SSI nor SSIIa compensate for elongation of DP >30 by SSIIIa. SSIIa could not resolve the pleiotropic increase of SSI caused by the absence of SSIIIa; instead, SSIIa further elongated those branches elongated by SSI. These results revealed compensatory differences among three major SS isozymes responsible for lengths of amylopectin branches.
28529503	Response of Methanogenic Microbial Communities to Desiccation Stress in Flooded and Rain-Fed Paddy Soil from Thailand.	2017	Front Microbiol	Rice paddies in central Thailand are flooded either by irrigation (irrigated rice) or by rain (rain-fed rice). The paddy soils and their microbial communities thus experience permanent or arbitrary submergence, respectively. Since methane production depends on anaerobic conditions, we hypothesized that structure and function of the methanogenic microbial communities are different in irrigated and rain-fed paddies and react differently upon desiccation stress. We determined rates and relative proportions of hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis before and after short-term drying of soil samples from replicate fields. The methanogenic pathway was determined by analyzing concentrations and δ13C of organic carbon and of CH4 and CO2 produced in the presence and absence of methyl fluoride, an inhibitor of aceticlastic methanogenesis. We also determined the abundance (qPCR) of genes and transcripts of bacterial 16S rRNA, archaeal 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA (coding for a subunit of the methyl coenzyme M reductase) and the composition of these microbial communities by T-RFLP fingerprinting and/or Illumina deep sequencing. The abundances of genes and transcripts were similar in irrigated and rain-fed paddy soil. They also did not change much upon desiccation and rewetting, except the transcripts of mcrA, which increased by more than two orders of magnitude. In parallel, rates of CH4 production also increased, in rain-fed soil more than in irrigated soil. The contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis increased in rain-fed soil and became similar to that in irrigated soil. However, the relative microbial community composition on higher taxonomic levels was similar between irrigated and rain-fed soil. On the other hand, desiccation and subsequent anaerobic reincubation resulted in systematic changes in the composition of microbial communities for both Archaea and Bacteria. It is noteworthy that differences in the community composition were mostly detected on the level of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% sequence similarity). The treatments resulted in change of the relative abundance of several archaeal OTUs. Some OTUs of Methanobacterium, Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, Methanocella and Methanomassiliicoccus increased, while some of Methanolinea and Methanosaeta decreased. Bacterial OTUs within Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes and Deltaproteobacteria increased, while OTUs within other proteobacterial classes decreased.
28611804	Development and Event-specific Detection of Transgenic Glyphosate-resistant Rice Expressing the <i>G2-EPSPS</i> Gene.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide, due to its broad spectrum, low cost, low toxicity, high efficiency, and non-selective characteristics. Rice farmers rarely use glyphosate as a herbicide, because the crop is sensitive to this chemical. The development of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant rice could greatly improve the economics of rice production. Here, we transformed the Pseudomonas fluorescens G2 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene G2-EPSPS, which conferred tolerance to glyphosate herbicide into a widely used japonica rice cultivar, Zhonghua 11 (ZH11), to develop two highly glyphosate-tolerant transgenic rice lines, G2-6 and G2-7, with one exogenous gene integration. Seed germination tests and glyphosate-tolerance assays of plants grown in a greenhouse showed that the two transgenic lines could greatly improve glyphosate-tolerance compared with the wild-type; The glyphosate-tolerance field test indicated that both transgenic lines could grow at concentrations of 20,000 ppm glyphosate, which is more than 20-times the recommended concentration in the field. Isolation of the flanking sequence of transgenic rice G2-6 indicated that the 5'-terminal of T-DNA was inserted into chromosome 8 of the rice genome. An event-specific PCR test system was established and the limit of detection of the primers reached five copies. Overall, the G2-EPSPS gene significantly improved glyphosate-tolerance in transgenic rice; furthermore, it is a useful candidate gene for the future development of commercial transgenic rice.
28744170	Improvement of seed shattering and dormancy in <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. 'Hokuriku 193' based on genetic information.	2017	Breed Sci	In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of seed shattering and dormancy in Hokuriku 193 and bred an NIL improved these traits. Analysis of an F3 population from Hokuriku 193 × Koshihikari revealed a general correspondence between seed shattering and genotypes at the qSH1 locus, suggesting a strong influence of this locus on the seed shattering in Hokuriku 193. An F2 population from [ms-bo] Nekken 2 × Hokuriku 193 was also analyzed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy as measured by germination rate in the first December and March after seed harvest. The results revealed a concurrence QTLs of on chromosomes 1, 3, and 6 (qSDo1, qSDo3, qSDo6). In particular, qSDo1 and qSDo6 were considered regions worthy of active modification because they were QTL regions that promoted seed dormancy when carrying Hokuriku 193 genome regions around. SSDo_NIL, a near isogenic line (NIL) derived from Hokuriku 193 by introgressing Nekken 2 alleles only at the qSH1 locus and qSDo1, did not shatter, and its germination rate was significantly higher than that of Hokuriku 193. Yield performance was similar between SSDo_NIL and Hokuriku 193, suggesting that improvement of seed shattering and dormancy does not affect yield.
28744182	Fine mapping of <i>qSKC-1</i>, a major quantitative trait locus for shoot K<sup>+</sup> concentration, in rice seedlings grown under salt stress.	2017	Breed Sci	Shoot K+ concentration (SKC) is an important physiological parameter used to evaluate salt tolerance at the seedling stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.). qSKC-1, a major quantitative trait locus for SKC in rice under salt stress, was detected on chromosome 1 using three F2 populations constructed by crossing 'Nipponbare' and its two salt-sensitive mutants (rss2 and rss4) with an indica cultivar 'Zhaiyeqing8' ('ZYQ8'). In this study, the chromosomal location of qSKC-1 was determined precisely by fine mapping. First, the presence of qSKC-1 was confirmed by QTL analysis of a re-constructed 'Nipponbare' × 'ZYQ8' F2 population. Then, F2 plants in which recombination events had occurred near qSKC-1 were identified from the 'Nipponbare' × 'ZYQ8' and rss4 × 'ZYQ8' F2 populations, and their phenotypic values were confirmed by progeny tests. Eventually, by analyzing recombination events in these recombinants, the qSKC-1 locus was mapped precisely to 445 kb between markers RM578 and IM8854. These results will facilitate map-based cloning of the qSKC-1 locus.
28529470	Microdissection of the A<sub>h</sub>01 chromosome in upland cotton and microcloning of resistance gene anologs from the single chromosome.	2017	Hereditas	BACKGROUND: Chromosome microdissection is one of the most important techniques in molecular cytogenetic research. Cotton (Gossypium Linnaeus, 1753) is the main natural fiber crop in the world. The resistance gene analog (RGA) cloning after its single chromosome microdissection can greatly promote cotton genome research and breeding.

RESULTS: Using the linker adaptor PCR (LA-PCR) with the primers of rice disease-resistance homologues, three nucleotide sequences PS016 (KU051681), PS054 (KU051682), and PS157 (KU051680) were obtained from the chromosome Ah01 of upland cotton (cv. TM-1). The Blast results showed that the three sequences are the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type RGAs. Clustering results indicated that they are homologous to these published RGAs. Thus, the three RGAs can definitely be confirmed as NBS-LRR class of RGAs in upland cotton.

CONCLUSIONS: Using single chromosome microdissection technique, DNA libraries containing cotton RGAs were obtained. This technique can promote cotton gene cloning, marker development and even the improvement of cotton genome research and breeding.
28611797	Characterization and Regulation of Aquaporin Genes of Sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench] in Response to Waterlogging Stress.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Waterlogging is a significant environmental constraint to crop production, and a better understanding of plant responses is critical for the improvement of crop tolerance to waterlogged soils. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a class of channel-forming proteins that play an important role in water transport in plants. This study aimed to examine the regulation of AQP genes under waterlogging stress and to characterize the genetic variability of AQP genes in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Transcriptional profiling of AQP genes in response to waterlogging stress in nodal root tips and nodal root basal regions of two tolerant and two sensitive sorghum genotypes at 18 and 96 h after waterlogging stress imposition revealed significant gene-specific pattern with regard to genotype, root tissue sample, and time point. For some tissue sample and time point combinations, PIP2-6, PIP2-7, TIP2-2, TIP4-4, and TIP5-1 expression was differentially regulated in tolerant compared to sensitive genotypes. The differential response of these AQP genes suggests that they may play a tissue specific role in mitigating waterlogging stress. Genetic analysis of sorghum revealed that AQP genes were clustered into the same four subfamilies as in maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) and that residues determining the AQP channel specificity were largely conserved across species. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 50 sorghum accessions were used to build an AQP gene-based phylogeny of the haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms of sorghum AQP genes placed the tolerant and sensitive genotypes used for the expression study in distinct groups. Expression analyses suggested that selected AQPs may play a pivotal role in sorghum tolerance to water logging stress. Further experimentation is needed to verify their role and to leverage phylogenetic analyses and AQP expression data to improve waterlogging tolerance in sorghum.
28560644	Biosorption and equilibrium isotherms study of cadmium removal by Nostoc muscorum Meg 1: morphological, physiological and biochemical alterations.	2017	3 Biotech	Rice fields of Meghalaya especially in the coal mining belt receive water contaminated by effluents from mines that are known to carry harmful heavy metal ions such as Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cd, As, Pb, Cr, etc. Cd exposure was analyzed in the cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum Meg 1 isolated from a contaminated rice field in Sohra, Meghalaya, India. Toxicity study established 0.5 ppm on day 3 to be the LD50. At LD50 chlorophyll a and total protein concentration was reduced by 50.9 and 52.5%, while nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase activities were inhibited by 40.8 and 38.4%. EDX and FTIR analyses confirmed Cd binding and participation of hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl and phosphate groups in biosorption of Cd onto the cell surfaces. SEM study established morphological changes. At pH 8.0 and temperature 25 ± 2 °C, the cyanobacterium removed 92% Cd within 24 h. Of this, 91% Cd was adsorbed on the cell surface while 4% was internally accumulated. The energy required for internal accumulation of Cd was partly provided in the form of ATP synthesized during active photosynthesis. The Langmuir isotherm was found best fitted with a R 2 value 0.98 when compared to Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. The maximum sorption capacity, Q max, of the organism was 71.4 mg of Cd per g of biomass. R L value of 0.29 indicated favorable interaction between cyanobacterial biomass and Cd. The adsorption intensity, n value 7.69 g/L obtained from Freundlich isotherm showed that the organism possessed high Cd sorption capacity.
28549969	The DTH8-Hd1 Module Mediates Day-Length-Dependent Regulation of Rice Flowering.	2017	Mol Plant	Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important pathways to govern flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), in which Heading date 1 (Hd1), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis CONSTANS gene, encodes a pivotal regulator. Hd1 promotes flowering under short-day conditions (SD) but represses flowering under long-day conditions (LD) by regulating the expression of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) ortholog in rice. However, the molecular mechanism of how Hd1 changes its regulatory activity in response to day length remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the repression of flowering in LD by Hd1 is dependent on the transcription factor DAYS TO HEADING 8 (DTH8). Loss of DTH8 function results in the activation of Hd3a by Hd1, leading to early flowering. We found that Hd1 directly interacts with DTH8 and that the formation of the DTH8-Hd1 complex is necessary for the transcriptional repression of Hd3a by Hd1 in LD, implicating that the switch of Hd1 function is mediated by DTH8 in LD rather than in SD. Furthermore, we revealed that DTH8 associates with the Hd3a promoter to modulate the level of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the Hd3a locus. In the presence of the DTH8-Hd1 complex, the H3K27me3 level was increased at Hd3a, whereas loss of DTH8 function resulted in decreased H3K27me3 level at Hd3a. Taken together, our findings indicate that, in response to day length, DTH8 plays a critical role in mediating the transcriptional regulation of Hd3a by Hd1 through the DTH8-Hd1 module to shape epigenetic modifications in photoperiodic flowering.
28517045	SET DOMAIN GROUP701 encodes a H3K4-methytransferase and regulates multiple key processes of rice plant development.	2017	New Phytol	Chromatin-based epigenetic information plays an important role in developmental gene regulation, in response to environment, and in natural variation of gene expression levels. Histone H3 lysine 4 di/trimethylation (H3K4me2/3) is abundant in euchromatin and is generally associated with transcriptional activation. Strikingly, however, enzymes catalyzing H3K4me2/3 remain poorly characterized in crops so far. Here, we investigated the function of the rice SET DOMAIN GROUP 701 (SDG701) gene by molecular and biochemical characterization of the gene product, and by studying effects of its loss or gain of function on plant growth and development. We demonstrated that SDG701 encodes a methytransferase specifically catalyzing H3K4 methylation. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that SDG701 is crucial for proper sporophytic plant development as well as for gametophytic transmission that directly impacts rice grain production. In-depth analysis of plant flowering time revealed that SDG701 promotes rice flowering under either long-day or short-day photoperiods. Consistently, the SDG701 protein was found to bind chromatin to promote H3K4me3 and to enhance expression of the rice Hd3a and RFT1 florigens. Collectively, our results establish SDG701 as a major rice H3K4-specific methyltransferase and provide important insights into function of H3K4me3 deposition in transcription activation of florigens in promoting plant flowering.
28582550	Fine mapping of a quantitative trait locus for spikelet number per panicle in a new plant type rice and evaluation of a near-isogenic line for grain productivity.	2017	J Exp Bot	Total spikelet number per panicle (TSN) is one of the determinants of grain productivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we attempted to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for TSN in the introgression lines with high TSN, derived from the cross of Indica Group variety IR 64 with new plant type lines. Two QTLs were detected on the long arm of chromosome 12: qTSN12.1 in the BC4F2 population of YTH63/IR 64 and qTSN12.2 in the BC4F3 population of YTH83/IR 64. TSN of the main tiller was significantly higher in near-isogenic lines (NILs) for qTSN12.1 (IR 64-NIL1; 188.6) and for qTSN12.2 (IR 64-NIL12; 199.4) than in IR 64 (141.2), owing to a significant increase in both primary and secondary branch numbers. These results suggest the critical function of these QTLs in the promotion of rachis branching at the panicle formation stage. Fine mapping of qTSN12.2 revealed six candidate genes in a 92-kb region of the Nipponbare reference genome sequence between flanking markers RM28746 and RM28753. Detailed phenotyping of agronomic traits of IR 64-NIL12 carrying qTSN12.2 showed drastic changes in plant architecture: this line had lower panicle number, longer culm, and longer and wider leaves compared with IR 64. Percentage of fertility and 1000-grain weight tended to be greater, and grain yield per square meter was also greater in IR 64-NIL12 than in IR 64. The newly identified QTLs will be useful for genetic improvement of the yield potential of Indica Group varieties. The markers tightly linked to qTSN12.2 are available for marker-assisted breeding.
28483441	The cytidine repressor participates in the regulatory pathway of indole in Pantoea agglomerans.	2017	Res Microbiol	Indole, an important signal molecule in both intraspecies and interspecies, regulates a variety of bacterial behaviors, but its regulatory mechanism is still unknown. Pantoea agglomerans YS19, a preponderant endophytic bacterium isolated from rice, does not produce indole, yet it senses exogenous indole. In this study, a mutant of YS19-Rpr whose target gene expression was downregulated by indole was selected through mTn5 transposon mutagenesis. Using the TAIL-PCR technique, the mutation gene was identified as a cytR homologue, which encodes a cytidine repressor (CytR) protein, a bacterial transcription factor involved in a complex regulation scheme. The negative regulation of indole in cytR, which is equivalent to the mutation in cytR, promotes the expression of a downstream gene deoC, which encodes the key enzyme deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase in participating in pentose metabolism. We found that DeoC is one of the regulatory proteins of P. agglomerans that is involved in counteracting starvation. Furthermore, the expression of deoC was induced by starvation conditions, accompanied by a decrease in cytR expression. This finding suggests that the indole signal and the mutation of cytR relieve inhibition of CytR in the transcription of deoC, facilitating better adaptation of the bacterium to the adverse conditions of the environment.
28558653	Genome-wide association study of salt tolerance at the seed germination stage in rice.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Improving the salt tolerance of direct-seeding rice at the seed germination stage is a major breeding goal in many Asian rice-growing countries, where seedlings must often establish in soils with a high salt content. Thus, it is important to understand the genetic mechanisms of salt tolerance in rice and to screen for germplasm with salt tolerance at the seed germination stage. Here, we investigated seven seed germination-related traits under control and salt-stress conditions and conducted a genome-wide association study based on the re-sequencing of 478 diverse rice accessions.

RESULTS: The analysis used a mixed linear model and was based on 6,361,920 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 478 rice accessions grouped into whole, indica, and non-indica panels. Eleven loci containing 22 significant salt tolerance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified based on the stress-susceptibility indices (SSIs) of vigor index (VI) and mean germination time (MGT). From the SSI of VI, six major loci were identified, explaining 20.2% of the phenotypic variation. From the SSI of MGT, five major loci were detected, explaining 26.4% of the phenotypic variation. Of these, seven loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 11, and 12 were close to six previously identified quantitative gene loci/genes related to tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses. The strongest association region for the SSI of MGT was identified in a ~ 13.3 kb interval (15450039-15,463,330) on chromosome 1, near salt-tolerance quantitative trait loci controlling the Na+: K+ ratio, total Na+ uptake, and total K+ concentration. The strongest association region for the SSI of VI was detected in a ~ 164.2 kb interval (526662-690,854) on chromosome 2 harboring two nitrate transporter family genes (OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2), which affect gene expression under salt stress. The haplotype analysis indicated that OsNRT2.2 was associated with subpopulation differentiation and its minor/rare tolerant haplotype was detected.

CONCLUSIONS: These results provide valuable information for salt tolerance-related gene cloning and for understanding the genetic mechanisms of salt tolerance at the seed germination stage. This information will be useful to improve the salt tolerance of direct-seeding rice varieties by genomic selection or marker-assisted selection.
28487477	A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (Oryza sativa) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na+ from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of OsMGT1 did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg2+ concentration (20-200 μm). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg2+ concentration (2 mm), although the total Na uptake was not altered. OsMGT1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that OsMGT1 was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. OsMGT1 was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg2+ concentration. Furthermore, knockout of OsHKT1;5 in osmgt1 mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg2+ transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.
28567664	QTL mapping and comparative genome analysis of agronomic traits including grain yield in winter rye.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Genetic diversity in elite rye germplasm as well as F 2:3 testcross design enables fast QTL mapping to approach genes controlling grain yield, grain weight, tiller number and heading date in rye hybrids. Winter rye (Secale cereale L.) is a multipurpose cereal crop closely related to wheat, which offers the opportunity for a sustainable production of food and feed and which continues to emerge as a renewable energy source for the production of bioethanol and biomethane. Rye contributes to increase agricultural crop species diversity particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to other small grain cereals, knowledge on the genetic architecture of complex inherited, agronomic important traits is yet limited for the outbreeding rye. We have performed a QTL analysis based on a F2:3 design and testcross performance of 258 experimental hybrids in multi-environmental field trials. A genetic linkage map covering 964.9 cM based on SSR, conserved-orthologous set (COS), and mixed-phase dominant DArT markers allowed to describe 22 QTL with significant effects for grain yield, heading date, tiller number, and thousand grain weight across seven environments. Using rye COS markers, orthologous segments for these traits have been identified in the rice genome, which carry cloned and functionally characterized rice genes. The initial genome scan described here together with the existing knowledge on candidate genes provides the basis for subsequent analyses of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying agronomic important traits in rye.
28469286	From ORYZA2000 to ORYZA (v3): An improved simulation model for rice in drought and nitrogen-deficient environments.	2017	Agric For Meteorol	The worldwide usage of and increasing citations for ORYZA2000 has established it as a robust and reliable ecophysiological model for predicting the growth and yield of rice in an irrigated lowland ecosystem. Because of its focus on irrigated lowlands, its computation ability is limited to the representation of the effects of the highly dynamic environments of upland, rainfed, and aerobic ecosystems on rice growth and yield. Additional modules and routines to quantify daily variations in soil temperature, carbon, nitrogen, and environmental stresses were then developed and integrated into ORYZA2000 to capture their effects on primary production, assimilate allocation, root growth, and water and nitrogen uptake. The newest version has been renamed "ORYZA version 3 (v3)". Case studies have shown that the root mean square errors (RMSE) between simulated and measured values for total biomass and yields ranged from 11.2% to 16.6% across experiments in non-drought and drought and/or nitrogen-deficient environments. ORYZA (v3) showed a significant reduction of the RMSE by at least 20%, thereby improving the model's capability to represent values measured under extreme conditions. It has also been significantly improved in representing the dynamics of soil water and crop leaf nitrogen contents. With an enhanced capability to simulate rice growth and development and predict yield in non-stressed, water-stressed and nitrogen-stressed environments, ORYZA (v3) is a reliable successor of ORYZA2000.
28587095	Comparative Study of Lectin Domains in Model Species: New Insights into Evolutionary Dynamics.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Lectins are present throughout the plant kingdom and are reported to be involved in diverse biological processes. In this study, we provide a comparative analysis of the lectin families from model species in a phylogenetic framework. The analysis focuses on the different plant lectin domains identified in five representative core angiosperm genomes (Arabidopsisthaliana, Glycine max, Cucumis sativus, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and Oryza sativa ssp. indica). The genomes were screened for genes encoding lectin domains using a combination of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), hidden Markov models, and InterProScan analysis. Additionally, phylogenetic relationships were investigated by constructing maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. The results demonstrate that the majority of the lectin families are present in each of the species under study. Domain organization analysis showed that most identified proteins are multi-domain proteins, owing to the modular rearrangement of protein domains during evolution. Most of these multi-domain proteins are widespread, while others display a lineage-specific distribution. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analyses reveal that some lectin families evolved to be similar to the phylogeny of the plant species, while others share a closer evolutionary history based on the corresponding protein domain architecture. Our results yield insights into the evolutionary relationships and functional divergence of plant lectins.
28483876	Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis.	2017	Plant Physiol	In rice (Oryza sativa), hybrids between indica and japonica subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, S5, composed of three adjacent genes (ORF3, ORF4, and ORF5), regulates female gamete fertility of indica-japonica hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed ORF5+ (BL5+) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed ORF3+ and ORF5+ (BL3+5+) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL5+ and BL showed that ORF5+ induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL3+5+/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.
28523639	Association Mapping of Yield and Yield-related Traits Under Reproductive Stage Drought Stress in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The identification and introgression of major-effect QTLs for grain yield under drought are some of the best and well-proven approaches for improving the drought tolerance of rice varieties. In the present study, we characterized Malaysian rice germplasm for yield and yield-related traits and identified significant trait marker associations by structured association mapping.

RESULTS: The drought screening was successful in screening germplasm with a yield reduction of up to 60% and heritability for grain yield under drought was up to 78%. There was a wider phenotypic and molecular diversity within the panel, indicating the suitability of the population for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Structure analyses clearly grouped the accessions into three subgroups with admixtures. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that LD decreased with an increase in distance between marker pairs and the LD decay varied from 5-20 cM. The Mixed Linear model-based structured association mapping identified 80 marker trait associations (MTA) for grain yield (GY), plant height (PH) and days to flowering (DTF). Seven MTA were identified for GY under drought stress, four of these MTA were consistently identified in at least two of the three analyses. Most of these MTA identified were on chromosomes 2, 5, 10, 11 and 12, and their phenotypic variance (PV) varied from 5% to 19%. The in silico analysis of drought QTL regions revealed the association of several drought-responsive genes conferring drought tolerance. The major-effect QTLs are useful in marker-assisted QTL pyramiding to improve drought tolerance.

CONCLUSION: The results have clearly shown that structured association mapping is one of the feasible options to identify major-effect QTLs for drought tolerance-related traits in rice.
28522870	The rice production practices of high yield and high nitrogen use efficiency in Jiangsu, China.	2017	Sci Rep	To face the great challenges of ensuring food security and environmental sustainability, agricultural production must be improved by high yield and high resource utilization efficiency (HYHE). We recently addressed this challenge and evaluated yield potential by surveying 735 farmers in 2008-2012 and then conducting 6 rice field experiments in 2008-2013 with large demonstration areas in 2010-2013 aimed to actualize the HYHE in Jiangsu Province, China. The survey result showed that the averaged N rate, grain yield and N partial factor productivity (PFPN) of the farmers were 336.7 kg ha-1, 8131.8 kg ha-1 and 24.2 kg kg-1, respectively. Through controlling total N rates and adjusting the application timing, the yield and the PFPN of optimal N managements (OPT) were increased by 5.9% and 37.6% with 31.4% reduction in N supply amounts for 6 experimental sites, and the yield increased by 5.6% for large demonstration areas compared with farmers' fertilizer practices (FFP), respectively. In conclusion, although the soil properties of the different regions varied, HYHE could be achieved by regulating the N management practices, thus contributing to higher rice production and lower environmental costs from intensive agriculture in Jiangsu, China.
28553305	A Dominant Negative OsKAT2 Mutant Delays Light-Induced Stomatal Opening and Improves Drought Tolerance without Yield Penalty in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Stomata are the main gateways for water and air transport between leaves and the environment. Inward-rectifying potassium channels regulate photo-induced stomatal opening. Rice contains three inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channel proteins, OsKAT1, OsKAT2, and OsKAT3. Among these, only OsKAT2 is specifically expressed in guard cells. Here, we investigated the functions of OsKAT2 in stomatal regulation using three dominant negative mutant proteins, OsKAT2(T235R), OsKAT2(T285A) and OsKAT2(T285D), which are altered in amino acids in the channel pore and at a phosphorylation site. Yeast complementation and patch clamp assays showed that all three mutant proteins lost channel activity. However, among plants overexpressing these mutant proteins, only plants overexpressing OsKAT2(T235R) showed significantly less water loss than the control. Moreover, overexpression of this mutant protein led to delayed photo-induced stomatal opening and increased drought tolerance. Our results indicate that OsKAT2 is an inward- rectifying shaker-like potassium channel that mainly functions in stomatal opening. Interestingly, overexpression of OsKAT2(T235R) did not cause serious defects in growth or yield in rice, suggesting that OsKAT2 is a potential target for engineering plants with improved drought tolerance without yield penalty.
28551566	Silica nanoparticles alleviate cadmium toxicity in rice cells: Mechanisms and size effects.	2017	Environ Pollut	Although it was recently determined that silicon can alleviate cadmium (Cd) toxicity in rice, the effects of silicon properties and the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, the effect of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) on Cd toxicity in rice was examined using cells cultured in suspension in the presence or absence of SiNPs (19 nm, 48 nm and 202 nm). The results showed that the presence of SiNPs substantially enhanced the proportion of live cells to 95.4%, 78.6% and 66.2%, respectively, suggesting that the extent of alleviation of Cd toxicity decreased gradually with size of SiNPs. The morphological results showed that dramatic damage and severe structural changes in the organelle integrity of cells occurred in the absence of SiNPs, whereas the cells exposed to the SiNPs remained nearly intact even in the presence of high concentrations of Cd. Furthermore, the SiNPs accumulated on the surface of the rice cells. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, Cd accumulated preferentially in plant cells with cell walls. In addition, noninvasive microtest technology showed that the average Cd2+ influx in those treated with SiNPs (19 nm, 48 nm and 202 nm) decreased by 15.7-, 11.1- and 4.6-fold, respectively. The gene expression of Cd uptake and transport (OsLCT1 and OsNramp5) was inhibited by SiNPs, but the gene expression of Cd transport into vacuole (OsHMA3) and Si uptake (OsLsi1) was enhanced by the SiNPs. These results indicate that the presence of SiNPs increased at least 1.87-fold the Si uptake capacity and inhibited the Cd uptake capacity, which together resulted in the alleviation of the toxicity of Cd in rice. This study provided a molecular-scale insight into the understanding of the SiNPs-induced alleviation of the toxicity of Cd in rice.
28744172	Identification of quantitative trait loci for rice grain quality and yield-related traits in two closely related <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. subsp. <i>japonica</i> cultivars grown near the northernmost limit for rice paddy cultivation.	2017	Breed Sci	Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with eating quality, grain appearance quality and yield-related traits were mapped in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from closely related rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) cultivars, Yukihikari (good eating quality) and Joiku462 (superior eating quality and high grain appearance quality). Apparent amylose content (AAC), protein content (PC), brown grain length (BGL), brown grain width (BGWI), brown grain thickness (BGT), brown grain weight per plant (BGW) and nine yield-related traits were evaluated in 133 RILs grown in four different environments in Hokkaido, near the northernmost limit for rice paddy cultivation. Using 178 molecular markers, a total of 72 QTLs were detected, including three for AAC, eight for PC, two for BGL, four for BGWI, seven for BGT, and six for BGW, on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Fifteen intervals were found to harbor multiple QTLs affecting these different traits, with most of these QTL clusters located on chromosomes 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12. These QTL findings should facilitate gene isolation and breeding application for improvement of eating quality, grain appearance quality and yield of rice cultivars.
28647840	Interaction of Ferulic Acid with Glutathione S-Transferase and Carboxylesterase Genes in the Brown Planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.	2017	J Chem Ecol	Plant phenolics are crucial defense phytochemicals against herbivores and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE) in herbivorous insects are well-known detoxification enzymes for such xenobiotics. To understand relationship between a plant phenolic and herbivore GST or CarE genes, we evaluated the relationship between a rice phenolic ferulic acid and resistance to brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), and investigated the interaction of ferulic acid with GST or CarE genes in BPH. The results indicate that ferulic acid content in tested rice varieties was highly associated with resistance to BPH. Bioassays using artificial diets show that the phenolic acid toxicity to BPH was dose dependent and the LC25 and LC50 were 5.81 and 23.30 μg/ml at 72 hr, respectively. Activities of the enzymes BPH GST and CarE were increased at concentrations below the LC50 of ferulic acid. Moreover, low ferulic acid concentrations (< LC25) upregulated the transcriptional levels of NlGSTD1 and NlGSTE1 of the GST family and NlCE of the CarE family. By using dsRNA-induced gene silencing (DIGS) of GST or CarE, it was shown that suppressed expression levels of NlGSTD1, NlGSTE1 and NlCE were 14.6%-21.2%, 27.8%-34.2%, and 10.5%-19.8%, respectively. Combination of NlGSTD1, NlGSTE1 or NlCE knockdown with ferulic acid increased nymph mortality by 92.9%, 119.9%, or 124.6%, respectively. These results suggest that depletion of detoxification genes in herbivorous insects by plant-mediated RNAi technology might be a new potential resource for improving rice resistance to BPH.
28600945	Effect of fluoride on photosynthesis, growth and accumulation of four widely cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in India.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Long-term use of fluoride contaminated groundwater to irrigate crops; especially paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) has resulted in elevated soil fluoride levels in Eastern India. There is, therefore, growing concern regarding accumulation of fluoride in rice grown on these soils. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of F on germination and phytotoxicity of four varieties of rice (Orzya sativa L.) (MTU-1010; IET-4094; IET-4786 and GB-1) grown in petri dish in a green house with inorganic sodium fluoride (NaF). Three different levels (0, 5, 10 and 20mg/L) of NaF solution were applied. At the end of the experiment (28 days), biochemical analysis (pigment, sugar, protein, amino acid and phenol), lipid peroxidation, root ion leakage and catalase activity along with fluoride accumulation and fresh and dry weight of roots and shoots of four cultivars were measured. The results revealed that all the four studied varieties exhibited gradual decrease of germination pattern with increasing concentration of F. Pigment and growth morphological study clearly demonstrated that the variety IET-4094 was the least influenced by F compare to the other three varieties of rice. The translocation factor (TF) was recorded to be the highest for variety IET-4786 (0.215 ± 0.03) at 5mg/L F concentration. All the four varieties showed higher level of fluoride accumulation in root than in shoot. Variable results were recorded for biochemical parameters and lipid peroxidation. Catalase activity and relative conductivity (root ion leakage) gradually increased with increasing F concentration for all the four varieties. It is speculated that fluoride accumulation in rice straw at very high levels will affect the feeding cattle and such contaminated straw could be a direct threat to their health and also, indirectly, to human health via presumably contaminated meat and milk.
28627026	Two NHX-type transporters from Helianthus tuberosus improve the tolerance of rice to salinity and nutrient deficiency stress.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The NHX-type cation/H+ transporters in plants have been shown to mediate Na+ (K+ )/H+ exchange for salinity tolerance and K+ homoeostasis. In this study, we identified and characterized two NHX homologues, HtNHX1 and HtNHX2 from an infertile and salinity tolerant species Helianthus tuberosus (cv. Nanyu No. 1). HtNHX1 and HtNHX2 share identical 5'- and 3'-UTR and coding regions, except for a 342-bp segment encoding 114 amino acids (L272 to Q385 ) which is absent in HtNHX2. Both hydroponics and soil culture experiments showed that the expression of HtNHX1 or HtNHX2 improved the rice tolerance to salinity. Expression of HtNHX2, but not HtNHX1, increased rice grain yield, harvest index, total nutrient uptake under K+ -limited salt-stress or general nutrient deficiency conditions. The results provide a novel insight into NHX function in plant mineral nutrition.
28592666	ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 Is Required for <i>M. truncatula</i> CLE12, But Not CLE13, Peptide Signaling through the SUNN Receptor Kinase.	2017	Plant Physiol	The combinatorial interaction of a receptor kinase and a modified CLE peptide is involved in several developmental processes in plants, including autoregulation of nodulation (AON), which allows legumes to limit the number of root nodules formed based on available nitrogen and previous rhizobial colonization. Evidence supports the modification of CLE peptides by enzymes of the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT/RDN) family. Here, we show by grafting and genetic analysis in Medicago truncatula that, in the AON pathway, RDN1, functioning in the root, acts upstream of the receptor kinase SUNN, functioning in the shoot. As expected for a glycosyltransferase, we found that RDN1 and RDN2 proteins are localized to the Golgi, as was shown previously for AtHPAT1. Using composite plants with transgenic hairy roots, we show that RDN1 and RDN2 orthologs from dicots as well as a related RDN gene from rice (Oryza sativa) can rescue the phenotype of rdn1-2 when expressed constitutively, but the less related MtRDN3 cannot. The timing of the induction of MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 peptide genes (negative regulators of AON) in nodulating roots is not altered by the mutation of RDN1 or SUNN, although expression levels are higher. Plants with transgenic roots constitutively expressing MtCLE12 require both RDN1 and SUNN to prevent nodule formation, while plants constitutively expressing MtCLE13 require only SUNN, suggesting that the two CLEs have different requirements for function. Combined with previous work, these data support a model in which RDN1 arabinosylates MtCLE12, and this modification is necessary for the transport and/or reception of the AON signal by the SUNN kinase.
28671251	Identification and characterization of the bZIP transcription factor involved in zinc homeostasis in cereals.	2017	Genet Mol Res	Members of the basic leucine zipper family, as bZIP19, are considered to be essential regulators of the adaptation to zinc deficiency. Knowing that this gene as well as its targets are conserved in the plant kingdom, we followed an in silico approach to identify and characterize the bzip19 gene in cereals. Through BLASTp in Phytozome database, 33 bzip19 genes were identified on the genomes of Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, Glycine max, Triticum aestivum, and Brachypodium distachyon. The analysis of conserved motifs and bZIP domains was performed using MEME and PFAM databases. In 25 of these genes, CysHis-motifs at the basic N-terminal region were found. This motif is conserved in group bZIP and suggested to play a role as a Zn-sensor. Regarding their phylogeny, it was possible to infer orthologous groups and explore the evolutionary relationship between these BZIP19 proteins. Data mining allowed us to select eight putative orthologous whose expression profile was analyzed under stress conditions in the Genevestigator platform. The comparison between the expression profiles of these eight putative orthologous and the original Arabidopsis bzip19 also seems to indicate conserved transcriptional regulation. Thus, considering that modified expression of bZIP19 genes has already been confirmed as an efficient tool to improve Arabidopsis tolerance to Zn deficiency, and that these new bZIP orthologous have a high level of conservation when compared to the original bZIP19 sequence, they can be useful for the development of tolerant crops enabling plants to grow in areas of low zinc bioavailability.
28694820	<i>WHITE STRIPE LEAF4</i> Encodes a Novel P-Type PPR Protein Required for Chloroplast Biogenesis during Early Leaf Development.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family in higher plants and perform diverse functions in organellar RNA metabolism. Despite the rice genome encodes 477 PRR proteins, the regulatory effects of PRR proteins on chloroplast development remains unknown. In this study, we report the functional characterization of the rice white stripe leaf4 (wsl4) mutant. The wsl4 mutant develops white-striped leaves during early leaf development, characterized by decreased chlorophyll content and malformed chloroplasts. Positional cloning of the WSL4 gene, together with complementation and RNA-interference tests, reveal that it encodes a novel P-family PPR protein with 12 PPR motifs, and is localized to chloroplast nucleoids. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that WSL4 is a low temperature response gene abundantly expressed in young leaves. Further expression analyses show that many nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes in the wsl4 mutant are significantly affected at the RNA and protein levels. Notably, the wsl4 mutant causes defects in the splicing of atpF, ndhA, rpl2, and rps12. Our findings identify WSL4 as a novel P-family PPR protein essential for chloroplast RNA group II intron splicing during early leaf development in rice.
28664567	Mechanisms of callose deposition in rice regulated by exogenous abscisic acid and its involvement in rice resistance to Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Callose is a plant cell wall polysaccharide controlled by β-1,3-glucanase and synthase. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant hormone. Exogenous ABA promotes rice resistance to pests. Whether exogenous ABA could reduce the decline in rice yield after brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH) feeding is an important question, however, the mechanisms behind rice resistance induced by ABA remain obscure.

RESULTS: Electronic penetration graph (EPG) recording indicated a significant increase in rice resistance to BPH, and the number of BPH eggs decreased significantly upon application of exogenous ABA. As the concentration of ABA increased, the reduction in rice yield decreased significantly after BPH feeding. Further studies showed that β-1,3-glucanase activity was significantly lower, but synthase activity was higher after ABA treatment than in controls.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that exogenous ABA suppressed β-1,3-glucanase and induced synthase activity, and promoted callose deposition. This is an important defense mechanism that prevents BPH from ingesting phloem sap. These studies provide support for an insect-resistance mechanism after ABA treatment and provide a reference for the integrated management of other piercing-sucking pests. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

28599126	Effect of water management and silicon on germination, growth, phosphorus and arsenic uptake in rice.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Silicon (Si) is the 2nd most abundant element in soil which is known to enhance stress tolerance in wide variety of crops. Arsenic (As), a toxic metalloid enters into the human food chain through contaminated water and food or feed. To alleviate the deleterious effect of As on human health, it is a need of time to find out an effective strategy to reduce the As accumulation in the food chain. The experiments were conducted during September-December 2014, and 2016 to optimize Si concentration for rice (Oryza sativa L.) exposed to As stress. Further experiment were carried out to evaluate the effect of optimum Si on rice seed germination, seedling growth, phosphorus and As uptake in rice plant. During laboratory experiment, rice seeds were exposed to 150 and 300µM As with and without 3mM Si supplementation. Results revealed that As application, decreased the germination up to 40-50% as compared to control treatment. Arsenic stress also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the seedling length but Si supplementation enhanced the seedlings length. Maximum seedling length (4.94cm) was recorded for 3mM Si treatment while, minimum seedling length (0.60cm) was observed at day7 by the application of 300µM As. Silicon application resulted in 10% higher seedling length than the control treatment. In soil culture experiment, plants were exposed to same concentrations of As and Si under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Irrigation water management, significantly (P˂0.05) affected the plant growth, Si and As concentrations in the plant. Arsenic uptake was relatively less under aerobic conditions. The maximum As concentration (9.34 and 27.70mgkg DW-1 in shoot and root, respectively) was found in plant treated with 300µM As in absence of Si under anaerobic condition. Similarly, anaerobic condition resulted in higher As uptake in the plants. The study demonstrated that aerobic cultivation is suitable to decrease the As uptake and in rice exogenous Si supply is beneficial to decrease As uptake under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions.
28158396	FIT: statistical modeling tool for transcriptome dynamics under fluctuating field conditions.	2017	Bioinformatics	Motivation: Considerable attention has been given to the quantification of environmental effects on organisms. In natural conditions, environmental factors are continuously changing in a complex manner. To reveal the effects of such environmental variations on organisms, transcriptome data in field environments have been collected and analyzed. Nagano et al. proposed a model that describes the relationship between transcriptomic variation and environmental conditions and demonstrated the capability to predict transcriptome variation in rice plants. However, the computational cost of parameter optimization has prevented its wide application.

Results: : We propose a new statistical model and efficient parameter optimization based on the previous study. We developed and released FIT, an R package that offers functions for parameter optimization and transcriptome prediction. The proposed method achieves comparable or better prediction performance within a shorter computational time than the previous method. The package will facilitate the study of the environmental effects on transcriptomic variation in field conditions.

28605980	Indoleacetic acid production and plant growth promoting potential of bacterial endophytes isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds.	2017	Acta Biol Hung	Bacterial endophytes from the phyllosphere and rhizosphere have been used to produce bioactive metabolites and to promote plant growth. However, little is known about the endophytes residing in seeds. This study aimed to isolate and identify seed-borne bacterial endophytes from rice and elucidate their potential for phytohormone production and growth enhancement. The isolated endophytes included Micrococcus yunnanensis RWL-2, Micrococcus luteus RWL-3, Enterobacter soli RWL-4, Leclercia adecarboxylata RWL-5, Pantoea dispersa RWL-6, and Staphylococcus epidermidis RWL-7, which were identified using 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. These strains were analyzed for indoleacetic acid (IAA) production by using GC-MS and IAA was found in the range of 11.50 ± 0.77 μg ml-1 to 38.80 ± 1.35 μg ml-1. We also assessed the strains for plant growth promoting potential because these isolates were able to produce IAA in pure culture. Most of the growth attributes of rice plants (shoot and root length, fresh and dry biomass, and chlorophyll content) were significantly increased by bacterial endophytes compared to the controls. These results show that IAA producing bacterial endophytes can improve hostplant growth traits and can be used as bio-fertilizers.
28664529	Phenology, sterility and inheritance of two environment genic male sterile (EGMS) lines for hybrid rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: There is still limited quantitative understanding of how environmental factors affect sterility of Environment-conditioned genic male sterility (EGMS) lines. A model was developed for this purpose and tested based on experimental data from Ndiaye (Senegal) in 2013-2015. For the two EGMS lines tested here, it was not clear if one or more recessive gene(s) were causing male sterility. This was tested by studying sterility segregation of the F2 populations.

RESULTS: Daylength (photoperiod) and minimum temperatures during the period from panicle initiation to flowering had significant effects on male sterility. Results clearly showed that only one recessive gene was involved in causing male sterility. The model was applied to determine the set of sowing dates of two different EGMS lines such that both would flower at the same time the pollen would be completely sterile. In the same time the local popular variety (Sahel 108, the male pollen donor) being sufficiently fertile to produce the hybrid seeds. The model was applied to investigate the viability of the two line breeding system in the same location with climate change (+2oC) and in two other potential locations: in M'Be in Ivory Coast and in the Nile delta in Egypt.

CONCLUSIONS: Apart from giving new insights in the relation between environment and EGMS, this study shows that these insights can be used to assess safe sowing windows and assess the suitability of sterility and fertility period of different environments for a two line hybrid rice production system.
28751198	Brassinolide-like activity of castasterone analogs with varied side chains against rice lamina inclination.	2017	Bioorg Med Chem	Brassinolide (BL) and castasterone (CS) are the representative members of brassinosteroid class of plant steroid hormone having plant growth promoting activity. In this study, eleven CS analogs bearing a variety of side chains were synthesized to determine the effect of the side chain structures on the BL-like activity. The plant hormonal activity was evaluated in a dwarf rice lamina inclination assay, and the potency was determined as the reciprocal logarithm of the 50% effective dose (ED50) from each dose-response curve. The reciprocal logarithm of ED50 (pED50) was decreased dramatically upon deletion of the C-28 methyl group of CS. The introduction of oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxy, methoxy, and ethoxycarbonyl was also unfavorable to the activity. The pED50 was influenced by the geometry of carbon-carbon double bond between C-24 and C-25 (cis and trans), but the introduction of a fluorine atom at the C-25 position of the double bond did not significantly change the activity. The binding free energy (ΔG) was calculated for all ligand-receptor binding interactions using molecular dynamics, resulting that ΔG is linearly correlated with the pED50.
28630893	A D53 repression motif induces oligomerization of TOPLESS corepressors and promotes assembly of a corepressor-nucleosome complex.	2017	Sci Adv	TOPLESS are tetrameric plant corepressors of the conserved Tup1/Groucho/TLE (transducin-like enhancer of split) family. We show that they interact through their TOPLESS domains (TPDs) with two functionally important ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs of the rice strigolactone signaling repressor D53: the universally conserved EAR-3 and the monocot-specific EAR-2. We present the crystal structure of the monocot-specific EAR-2 peptide in complex with the TOPLESS-related protein 2 (TPR2) TPD, in which the EAR-2 motif binds the same TPD groove as jasmonate and auxin signaling repressors but makes additional contacts with a second TPD site to mediate TPD tetramer-tetramer interaction. We validated the functional relevance of the two TPD binding sites in reporter gene assays and in transgenic rice and demonstrate that EAR-2 binding induces TPD oligomerization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the TPD directly binds nucleosomes and the tails of histones H3 and H4. Higher-order assembly of TPD complexes induced by EAR-2 binding markedly stabilizes the nucleosome-TPD interaction. These results establish a new TPD-repressor binding mode that promotes TPD oligomerization and TPD-nucleosome interaction, thus illustrating the initial assembly of a repressor-corepressor-nucleosome complex.
28577284	Overexpression of Rice Auxilin-Like Protein, XB21, Induces Necrotic Lesions, up-Regulates Endocytosis-Related Genes, and Confers Enhanced Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice immune receptor XA21 confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To elucidate the mechanism of XA21-mediated immunity, we previously performed a yeast two-hybrid screening for XA21 interactors and identified XA21 binding protein 21 (XB21).

RESULTS: Here, we report that XB21 is an auxilin-like protein predicted to function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate an XA21/XB21 in vivo interaction using co-immunoprecipitation in rice. Overexpression of XB21 in rice variety Kitaake and a Kitaake transgenic line expressing XA21 confers a necrotic lesion phenotype and enhances resistance to Xoo. RNA sequencing reveals that XB21 overexpression results in the differential expression of 8735 genes (4939 genes up- and 3846 genes down-regulated) (≥2-folds, FDR ≤0.01). The up-regulated genes include those predicted to be involved in 'cell death' and 'vesicle-mediated transport'.

CONCLUSION: These results indicate that XB21 plays a role in the plant immune response and in regulation of cell death. The up-regulation of genes controlling 'vesicle-mediated transport' in XB21 overexpression lines is consistent with a functional role for XB21 as an auxilin.
28663588	The Nep1-like protein family of Magnaporthe oryzae is dispensable for the infection of rice plants.	2017	Sci Rep	The necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein 1 (Nep1)-like proteins (NLPs) are a class of microbe-associated molecular patterns widely distributed across diverse groups of plant-associated microorganisms. In spite of the cytotoxic activity in dicot plants, the role of most NLPs in the virulence of plant pathogens is still largely unknown. We showed that the MoNLP family of rice blast fungus varied very little in amino acid sequence, transient expression of three MoNLPs induced cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species in Nicotiana benthamiana, and the expression of MoNLPs was induced during infection of susceptible rice plants. To further investigate the biological role of the MoNLP family, a marker-free gene replacement vector was developed and used to knock out the whole family in Magnaporthe oryzae. Results showed no significant difference in disease levels caused by wild type and the quadruple ΔMoNLP mutant strains. Likewise, the sporulation and radial growth of the two strains were similar under various unfavorable cultural conditions including malnutrition and abiotic stresses. These observations demonstrated that the MoNLP family is dispensable for the fungal tolerance to the tested adverse cultural conditions, and more importantly, for the virulence of blast fungus on susceptible rice plants.
28655403	Yuan Longping, Hybrid Rice, and the Meaning of Science in the Cultural Revolution and Beyond.	2017	Endeavour	This paper uses the case of hybrid rice to chart changes in the meanings science has carried in China from the Mao era to today. It begins by using Chinese journal articles to reconstruct the 1970s development of hybrid rice technology by a network of diverse historical actors. It then documents the emergence during the Hua Guofeng era (1976-1978) of a historical narrative of hybrid rice centered on the figures of Yuan Longping and Hua Guofeng. Finally, it surveys post-1978 biographies of Yuan Longping to identify changes and continuities in scientific values. The paper demonstrates that, although the reform era has witnessed the replacement of most of the Maoist vision of mass (or tu) science with a vision far more consistent with the values of international, professional (yang) science, the legacy of the Mao era can still be seen in a continued emphasis on certain aspects of Mao Zedong Thought, a strong narrative of nationalist triumphalism, and a celebration of Yuan Longping as an "intellectual peasant."
28488420	OsHKT1;5 mediates Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion in the vasculature to protect leaf blades and reproductive tissues from salt toxicity in rice.	2017	Plant J	Salt tolerance quantitative trait loci analysis of rice has revealed that the SKC1 locus, which is involved in a higher K+ /Na+ ratio in shoots, corresponds to the OsHKT1;5 gene encoding a Na+ -selective transporter. However, physiological roles of OsHKT1;5 in rice exposed to salt stress remain elusive, and no OsHKT1;5 gene disruption mutants have been characterized to date. In this study, we dissected two independent T-DNA insertional OsHKT1;5 mutants. Measurements of ion contents in tissues and 22 Na+ tracer imaging experiments showed that loss-of-function of OsHKT1;5 in salt-stressed rice roots triggers massive Na+ accumulation in shoots. Salt stress-induced increases in the OsHKT1;5 transcript were observed in roots and basal stems, including basal nodes. Immuno-staining using an anti-OsHKT1;5 peptide antibody indicated that OsHKT1;5 is localized in cells adjacent to the xylem in roots. Additionally, direct introduction of 22 Na+ tracer to leaf sheaths also demonstrated the involvement of OsHKT1;5 in xylem Na+ unloading in leaf sheaths. Furthermore, OsHKT1;5 was indicated to be present in the plasma membrane and found to localize also in the phloem of diffuse vascular bundles in basal nodes. Together with the characteristic 22 Na+ allocation in the blade of the developing immature leaf in the mutants, these results suggest a novel function of OsHKT1;5 in mediating Na+ exclusion in the phloem to prevent Na+ transfer to young leaf blades. Our findings further demonstrate that the function of OsHKT1;5 is crucial over growth stages of rice, including the protection of the next generation seeds as well as of vital leaf blades under salt stress.
28671258	Selection of candidate reference genes and validation for real-time PCR studies in rice plants exposed to low temperatures.	2017	Genet Mol Res	Rice is a cereal that presents a great ability to adapt to different soil and climate conditions. However, as it is a tropical crop with C3 metabolism, it performs better in warm temperatures with high solar radiation. Tolerance to stress caused by low temperatures is a highly complex process that involves various metabolic pathways and cellular compartments, resulting in general or specific effects on plant growth and development. In order to observe the true effect of a particular stress on genetic expression, reference genes need to be chosen for real-time PCRs, the expression levels of which should remain stable independent of the situation imposed. In this paper, the expression stability was evaluated of the actin 11 (ACT11), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 (UBC-E2), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta tubilin (β-Tubulin), eukaryotic initiation factor 4α (eIF-4-α), eukaryotic initiation factor 1α (eIF-1-α), ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10), ubiquitin 5 (UBQ5), aquaporin (TIP41), and cyclophilin genes, in two rice genotypes cultivated in low temperature (13°C) conditions in vegetative stage (V4). The analysis material (leaves) was collected after 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h of exposure to the stress. In this study, the geNorm, BestKeeper, ΔCt, NormFinder, and RefFinder methods were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes. The results revealed that the most indicated genes for all the analysis methods were UBQ10 and UBQ5 for BRS Bojuru and BRS Pampa, respectively. On the other hand, the eIF-1-α gene presents the least expression stability and is not indicated for studies of rice plants subjected to low temperatures. The validation with the antioxidant system genes SODCc1-Cu/Zn, CATC, APX2, and GR2 confirmed the importance of using previously tested normalizing genes for adequate real-time PCR results.
28642778	Characterization of Salt-Induced Epigenetic Segregation by Genome-Wide Loss of Heterozygosity and its Association with Salt Tolerance in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	In a breeding effort to develop salt tolerant (ST) rice varieties by designed QTL pyramiding, large numbers of progenies derived from four crosses between salt- or drought- tolerant BC2F5 IR64 introgression lines, were subjected to severe salt stress, resulting in 422 ST plants. The progeny testing of the selected F3 lines under more severe salt stress resulted in identification of 16 promising homozygous lines with high levels of ST. Genetic characterization of the 422 ST F3 progeny and 318 random F2 plants from the same four crosses using 105 segregating SSR markers lead to three interesting discoveries: (1) salt stress can induce genome-wide epigenetic segregation (ES) characterized by complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nearly complete loss of an allele (LOA) in the F3 progenies of four rice populations in a single generation; (2) ∼25% of the stress-induced ES loci were transgenerational and inherited from their salt- and drought- selected parents; and (3) the salt-induced LOH and LOA loci (regions) appeared to contain genes/alleles associated with ST and/or drought tolerance. 32 genomic regions that showed one or more types of salt-induced ES in the random and salt-selected progenies from these crosses. The same or different types of ES were detected with two large genomic regions on chromosomes 1 and 6 where more and the strongest ES were found across different populations. 14 genomic regions were found where the salt-induced ES regions were overlapping with QTL affecting ST related traits. The discovery of the three types of salt-induced ES showed several interesting characteristics and had important implications in evolution and future breeding for developing stress-resilient rice and crops.
28633373	Auxin transport and response requirements for root hydrotropism differ between plant species.	2017	J Exp Bot	The direction of auxin transport changes in gravistimulated roots, causing auxin accumulation in the lower side of horizontally reoriented roots. This study found that auxin was similarly involved in hydrotropism and gravitropism in rice and pea roots, but hydrotropism in Lotus japonicus roots was independent of both auxin transport and response. Application of either auxin transport inhibitors or an auxin response inhibitor decreased both hydrotropism and gravitropism in rice roots, and reduced hydrotropism in pea roots. However, Lotus roots treated with these inhibitors showed reduced gravitropism but an unaltered or an enhanced hydrotropic response. Inhibiting auxin biosynthesis substantially reduced both tropisms in rice and Lotus roots. Removing the final 0.2 mm (including the root cap) from the root tip inhibited gravitropism but not hydrotropism in rice seedling roots. These results suggested that modes of auxin involvement in hydrotropism differed between plant species. In rice roots, although auxin transport and responses were required for both gravitropism and hydrotropism, the root cap was involved in the auxin regulation of gravitropism but not hydrotropism. Hydrotropism in Lotus roots, however, may be regulated by a novel mechanism that is independent of both auxin transport and the TIR1/AFBs auxin response pathway.
28638401	Development of Elite BPH-Resistant Wide-Spectrum Restorer Lines for Three and Two Line Hybrid Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Hybrid rice has contributed significantly to the world food security. Breeding of elite high-yield, strong-resistant broad-spectrum restorer line is an important strategy for hybrid rice in commercial breeding programs. Here, we developed three elite brown planthopper (BPH)-resistant wide-spectrum restorer lines by pyramiding big-panicle gene Gn8.1, BPH-resistant genes Bph6 and Bph9, fertility restorer genes Rf3, Rf4, Rf5, and Rf6 through molecular marker assisted selection. Resistance analysis revealed that the newly developed restorer lines showed stronger BPH-resistance than any of the single-gene donor parent Luoyang-6 and Luoyang-9. Moreover, the three new restorer lines had broad spectrum recovery capabilities for Honglian CMS, Wild abortive CMS and two-line GMS sterile lines, and higher grain yields than that of the recurrent parent 9,311 under nature field conditions. Importantly, the hybrid crosses also showed good performance for grain yield and BPH-resistance. Thus, the development of elite BPH-resistant wide-spectrum restorer lines has a promising future for breeding of broad spectrum BPH-resistant high-yield varieties.
28668595	Diagnosing ozone stress and differential tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with ethylenediurea (EDU).	2017	Environ Pollut	Rising tropospheric ozone concentrations in Asia necessitate the breeding of adapted rice varieties to ensure food security. However, breeding requires field-based evaluation of ample plant material, which can be technically challenging or very costly when using ozone fumigation facilities. The chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) has been proposed for estimating the effects of ozone in large-scale field applications, but controlled experiments investigating constitutive effects on rice or its suitability to detect genotypic differences in ozone tolerance are missing. This study comprised a controlled open top chamber experiment with four treatments (i) control (average ozone concentration 16 ppb), (ii) control with EDU application, (iii) ozone stress (average 77 ppb for 7 h daily throughout the season), and (iv) ozone stress with EDU application. Three contrasting rice genotypes were tested, i.e. the tolerant line L81 and the sensitive Nipponbare and BR28. The ozone treatment had significant negative effects on plant growth (height and tillering), stomatal conductance, SPAD value, spectral reflectance indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lipid peroxidation, as well as biomass and grain yields. These negative effects were more pronounced in the a priori sensitive varieties, especially the widely grown Bangladeshi variety BR28, which showed grain yield reductions by 37 percent. EDU application had almost no effects on plants in the absence of ozone, but partly mitigated ozone effects on foliar symptoms, lipid peroxidation, SPAD value, stomatal conductance, several spectral reflectance parameters, panicle number, grain yield, and spikelet sterility. EDU responses were more pronounced in sensitive genotypes than in the tolerant L81. In conclusion, EDU had no constitutive effects on rice and partly offset negative ozone effects, especially in sensitive varieties. It can thus be used to diagnose ozone damage in field grown rice and for distinguishing tolerant (less EDU-responsive) and sensitive (more EDU-responsive) genotypes.
28487379	1-<i>N</i>-histidine phosphorylation of ChlD by the AAA<sup>+</sup> ChlI2 stimulates magnesium chelatase activity in chlorophyll synthesis.	2017	Biochem J	Magnesium chelatase (Mg-chelatase) inserts magnesium into protoporphyrin during the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll. Enzyme activity is reconstituted by forming two separate preactivated complexes consisting of a GUN4/ChlH/protoporphyrin IX substrate complex and a ChlI/ChlD enzyme 'motor' complex. Formation of the ChlI/ChlD complex in both Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Oryza sativa is accompanied by phosphorylation of ChlD by ChlI, but the orthologous protein complex from Rhodobacter capsulatus, BchI/BchD, gives no detectable phosphorylation of BchD. Phosphorylation produces a 1-N-phospho-histidine within ChlD. Proteomic analysis indicates that phosphorylation occurs at a conserved His residue in the C-terminal integrin I domain of ChlD. Comparative analysis of the ChlD phosphorylation with enzyme activities of various ChlI/ChlD complexes correlates the phosphorylation by ChlI2 with stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity. Mutation of the H641 of CrChlD to E641 prevents both phosphorylation and stimulation of Mg-chelatase activity, confirming that phosphorylation at H641 stimulates Mg-chelatase. The properties of ChlI2 compared with ChlI1 of Chlamydomonas and with ChlI of Oryza, shows that ChlI2 has a regulatory role in Chlamydomonas.
28654018	A Quantitative Acetylomic Analysis of Early Seed Development in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Int J Mol Sci	PKA (protein lysine acetylation) is a critical post-translational modification that regulates various developmental processes, including seed development. However, the acetylation events and dynamics on a proteomic scale in this process remain largely unknown, especially in rice early seed development. We report the first quantitative acetylproteomic study focused on rice early seed development by employing a mass spectral-based (MS-based), label-free approach. A total of 1817 acetylsites on 1688 acetylpeptides from 972 acetylproteins were identified in pistils and seeds at three and seven days after pollination, including 268 acetyproteins differentially acetylated among the three stages. Motif-X analysis revealed that six significantly enriched motifs, such as (DxkK), (kH) and (kY) around the acetylsites of the identified rice seed acetylproteins. Differentially acetylated proteins among the three stages, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -glucose pyrophosphorylases (AGPs), PDIL1-1 (protein disulfide isomerase like 1-1), hexokinases, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and numerous other regulators that are extensively involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and photosynthesis pathways during early seed development. This study greatly expanded the rice acetylome dataset, and shed novel insight into the regulatory roles of PKA in rice early seed development.
28549191	Maintenance of phosphate homeostasis and root development are coordinately regulated by MYB1, an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	The adaptive responses of plants to phosphate (Pi) starvation stress are fine-tuned by an elaborate regulatory network. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel Pi starvation-responsive gene, MYB1, encoding an R2R3-type transcription factor in rice. MYB1 was transcriptionally induced in leaf sheaths and old leaf blades. It was localized to the nucleus and expressed mainly in vascular tissues. Mutation of MYB1 led to an increase in Pi uptake and accumulation, accompanied by altered expression of a subset of Pi transporters and several genes involved in Pi starvation signaling. Furthermore, MYB1 affected the elongation of the primary root in a Pi-dependent manner and lateral roots in a Pi-independent manner. Moreover, gibberellic acid (GA)-triggered lateral root elongation was largely suppressed in wild-type plants under Pi starvation conditions, whereas this suppression was partially rescued in myb1 mutant lines, correlating with the up-regulation of a GA biosynthetic gene upon MYB1 mutation. Taken together, the findings of this study highlight the role of MYB1 as a regulator involved in both Pi starvation signaling and GA biosynthesis. Such a co-regulator might have broad implications for the study of cross-talk between nutrient stress and other signaling pathways.

28577021	Segmental Duplication of Chromosome 11 and its Implications for Cell Division and Genome-wide Expression in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Segmental duplication is a major structural variation that occurs in chromosomes. Duplication leads to the production of gene copies with increased numbers of related repeat segments, causing the global genome to be in a state of imbalance. In addition, if the added segment contains a centromeric specific DNA, the duplicated chromosome will have structural multiple centromeres. We identified a segmental duplication containing structurally tricentric regions derived from the short arm of chromosome 11 (11L∙ + 11L∙ + 11S∙11S∙11S∙11S, "∙" represents the centromeric DNA repeat loci), and analyzed its implications for cell division and genome-wide expression. In the variant, only the middle centromere of 11S∙11S∙11S∙11S is functionally active. As a result, the structurally tricentric chromosome was stable in mitosis, because it is actually a functional monocentric chromosome. However, the structurally tricentric chromosome, which usually formed a bivalent, was either arranged on the equatorial plane or was lagging, which affected its separation during meiosis. Furthermore, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis showed that the segmental duplication affected genome-wide expression patterns. 34.60% of genes in repeat region showed positive dosage effect. Thus, the genes on chromosome arm 11S-2 didn't exhibit obviously dosage compensation, as illustrated by no peak around a ratio of 1.00. However, the gene dosage effect will reduce after sexual reproduction of a generation.
28620222	Nitric oxide mediated transcriptional modulation enhances plant adaptive responses to arsenic stress.	2017	Sci Rep	Arsenic (As) contamination in rice leads to yield decline and causes carcinogenic risk to human health. Although the role of nitric oxide (NO) in reducing As toxicity is known, NO-mediated genetic modulation in the plant during arsenic toxicity has not yet been established. We analyzed the key components of NO metabolism and the correlations between NO interaction and arsenic stress using rice as a relevant model plant. Illumina sequencing was used to investigate the NO-mediated genome-wide temporal transcriptomic modulation in rice root upon AsIII exposure during 12 days (d) of the growth period. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was used as NO donor. SNP supplementation resulted in marked decrease in ROS, cell death and As accumulation during AsIII stress. NO was found to modulate metal transporters particularly NIP, NRAMP, ABC and iron transporters, stress related genes such as CytP450, GSTs, GRXs, TFs, amino acid, hormone(s), signaling and secondary metabolism genes involved in As detoxification. We detected NO-mediated change in jasmonic acid (JA) content during AsIII stress. The study infers that NO reduces AsIII toxicity through modulating regulatory networks involved in As detoxification and JA biosynthesis.
28622672	Physiological Effects of Single- and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Rice Seedlings.	2017	IEEE Trans Nanobioscience	In this paper, single-walled carbon nano- tubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nano- tubes (MWCNTs) were found to accelerate leaf growth and development of rice seedlings at a low concentration (20 mg/L), accompanied with the increased chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate (PN). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that both SWCNTs and MWCNTs significantly increased expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and cell sizes. Further analysis revealed that the abscisic acid content decreased and the gibberellin content increased while the content of [Formula: see text] and H2O2 was slightly elevated and the activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1, and POD, EC 1.11.1.7) were differently modulated after treatment with the carbon nanotube (CNT). These results suggest a possible link between reactive oxygen species and plant hormones under CNTs treatment to promote rice seedlings growth.
28573759	Persistence of plant hormone levels in rice shoots grown under microgravity conditions in space: its relationship to maintenance of shoot growth.	2017	Physiol Plant	We investigated the effects of microgravity environment on growth and plant hormone levels in dark-grown rice shoots cultivated in artificial 1 g and microgravity conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). Growth of microgravity-grown shoots was comparable to that of 1 g-grown shoots. Endogenous levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in shoots remained constant, while those of abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs) decreased during the cultivation period under both conditions. The levels of auxin, ABA, JA, CKs and GAs in rice shoots grown under microgravity conditions were comparable to those under 1 g conditions. These results suggest microgravity environment in space had minimal impact on levels of these plant hormones in rice shoots, which may be the cause of the persistence of normal growth of shoots under microgravity conditions. Concerning ethylene, the expression level of a gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, the key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis, was reduced under microgravity conditions, suggesting that microgravity may affect the ethylene production. Therefore, ethylene production may be responsive to alterations of the gravitational force.
28653783	Protein phosphatases potentially associated with regulation of microtubules, their spatial structure reconstruction and analysis.	2017	Cell Biol Int	According to the sequence and profile comparison with known catalytic domains, where identified protein phosphatases potentially involved in regulation of microtubule dynamics and structure from Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, Medicago sativa, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Zea mays, and Triticum aestivum. Selected proteins were related to classical non-receptor, serine/threonine-specific and dual protein phosphatases. By application of template structures of human protein phosphatases, it was performed homology modelling of the catalytic domains of 17 plant protein phosphatases. Based on the results of the structural alignment, molecular dynamics, and conservatism in positions of functionally importance, it was confirmed homology of selected plant proteins and known protein phosphatases regulating structure and dynamics of microtubules.
28676818	Photosynthetic Properties and Potentials for Improvement of Photosynthesis in Pale Green Leaf Rice under High Light Conditions.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Light is the driving force of plant growth, providing the energy required for photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is also vulnerable to light-induced damage caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Plants have therefore evolved various protective mechanisms such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) to dissipate excessively absorbed solar energy as heat; however, photoinhibition and NPQ represent a significant loss in solar energy and photosynthetic efficiency, which lowers the yield potential in crops. To estimate light capture and light energy conversion in rice, a genotype with pale green leaves (pgl) and a normally pigmented control (Z802) were subjected to high (HL) and low light (LL). Chlorophyll content, light absorption, chloroplast micrographs, abundance of light-harvesting complex (LHC) binding proteins, electron transport rates (ETR), photochemical and non-photochemical quenching, and generation of ROS were subsequently examined. Pgl had a smaller size of light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna and absorbed less photons than Z802. NPQ and the generation of ROS were also low, while photosystem II efficiency and ETR were high, resulting in improved photosynthesis and less photoinhibition in pgl than Z802. Chlorophyll synthesis and solar conversion efficiency were higher in pgl under HL compared to LL treatment, while Z802 showed an opposite trend due to the high level of photoinhibition under HL. In Z802, excessive absorption of solar energy not only increased the generation of ROS and NPQ, but also exacerbated the effects of increases in temperature, causing midday depression in photosynthesis. These results suggest that photosynthesis and yield potential in rice could be enhanced by truncated light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size.
28584974	High Resolution Mapping of QTLs for Heat Tolerance in Rice Using a 5K SNP Array.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Heat stress is one of the major abiotic threats to rice production, next to drought and salinity stress. Incidence of heat stress at reproductive phase of the crop results in abnormal pollination leading to floret sterility, low seed set and poor grain quality. Identification of QTLs and causal genes for heat stress tolerance at flowering will facilitate breeding for improved heat tolerance in rice. In the present study, we used 272 F8 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Nagina22, a well-known heat tolerant Aus cultivar and IR64, a heat sensitive popular Indica rice variety to map the QTLs for heat tolerance.

RESULTS: To enable precise phenotyping for heat stress tolerance, we used a controlled phenotyping facility available at ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Karnal, India. Based on 'days to 50% flowering' data of the RILs, we followed staggered sowing to synchronize flowering to impose heat stress at uniform stage. Using the Illumina infinium 5K SNP array for genotyping the parents and the RILs, and stress susceptibility and stress tolerance indices (SSI and STI) of percent spikelet sterility and yield per plant (g), we identified five QTLs on chromosomes 3, 5, 9 and 12. The identified QTLs explained phenotypic variation in the range of 6.27 to 21. 29%. Of these five QTLs, two high effect QTLs, one novel (qSTIPSS9.1) and one known (qSTIY5.1/qSSIY5.2), were mapped in less than 400 Kbp genomic regions, comprising of 65 and 54 genes, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified two major QTLs for heat tolerance in rice in narrow physical intervals, which can be employed for crop improvement by marker assisted selection (MAS) after development of suitable scorable markers for breeding of high yielding heat tolerant rice varieties. This is the first report of a major QTL for heat tolerance on chromosome 9 of rice. Further, a known QTL for heat tolerance on chromosome 5 was narrowed down from 23 Mb to 331 Kbp in this study.
28690622	Nitrogen Metabolism in Adaptation of Photosynthesis to Water Stress in Rice Grown under Different Nitrogen Levels.	2017	Front Plant Sci	To investigate the role of nitrogen (N) metabolism in the adaptation of photosynthesis to water stress in rice, a hydroponic experiment supplying with low N (0.72 mM), moderate N (2.86 mM), and high N (7.15 mM) followed by 150 g⋅L-1 PEG-6000 induced water stress was conducted in a rainout shelter. Water stress induced stomatal limitation to photosynthesis at low N, but no significant effect was observed at moderate and high N. Non-photochemical quenching was higher at moderate and high N. In contrast, relative excessive energy at PSII level (EXC) was declined with increasing N level. Malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents were in parallel with EXC. Water stress decreased catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities at low N, resulting in increased H2O2 content and severer membrane lipid peroxidation; whereas the activities of antioxidative enzymes were increased at high N. In accordance with photosynthetic rate and antioxidative enzymes, water stress decreased the activities of key enzymes involving in N metabolism such as glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase, and photorespiratory key enzyme glycolate oxidase at low N. Concurrently, water stress increased nitrate content significantly at low N, but decreased nitrate content at moderate and high N. Contrary to nitrate, water stress increased proline content at moderate and high N. Our results suggest that N metabolism appears to be associated with the tolerance of photosynthesis to water stress in rice via affecting CO2 diffusion, antioxidant capacity, and osmotic adjustment.
28650429	Acetate-mediated novel survival strategy against drought in plants.	2017	Nat Plants	Water deficit caused by global climate changes seriously endangers the survival of organisms and crop productivity, and increases environmental deterioration1,2. Plants' resistance to drought involves global reprogramming of transcription, cellular metabolism, hormone signalling and chromatin modification3-8. However, how these regulatory responses are coordinated via the various pathways, and the underlying mechanisms, are largely unknown. Herein, we report an essential drought-responsive network in which plants trigger a dynamic metabolic flux conversion from glycolysis into acetate synthesis to stimulate the jasmonate (JA) signalling pathway to confer drought tolerance. In Arabidopsis, the ON/OFF switching of this whole network is directly dependent on histone deacetylase HDA6. In addition, exogenous acetic acid promotes de novo JA synthesis and enrichment of histone H4 acetylation, which influences the priming of the JA signalling pathway for plant drought tolerance. This novel acetate function is evolutionarily conserved as a survival strategy against environmental changes in plants. Furthermore, the external application of acetic acid successfully enhanced the drought tolerance in Arabidopsis, rapeseed, maize, rice and wheat plants. Our findings highlight a radically new survival strategy that exploits an epigenetic switch of metabolic flux conversion and hormone signalling by which plants adapt to drought.
28716407	Overexpression of Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress.	2017	Plant Sci	Frequent cold spells in late spring can damage early rice seedlings. However, overexpression of the silicon-uptake gene Lsi1 (Lsi1-OX) in cold-sensitive rice (Oryza sativa L., accession: Dular) notably enhances its chilling resistance. In this study, we found that continual chilling led to chlorophyll and RNA degradation in wild-type Dular leaves, whereas leaves from a Lsi1-OX line exhibited no obvious changes. A comparison of the global mRNA expression between the two rice lines showed that genes encoding photosynthesis-antenna proteins were downregulated and those encoding the proteasome were upregulated in the wild-type organism. Moreover, the differential responses of the two rice lines to chilling stress were found to correlate with the transcription factor OsWRKY53, which was predicted target of the respective microRNA (miRNA) novel-m0586-5p. In addition, miRNAs that targeted genes involved in the process of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were differentially expressed in the two rice lines after chilling stress, when comparative analysis of the outcomes of RNA sequencing on the two rice lines. Our results suggest that when overexpressed Lsi1 in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress.
28674279	Characterization of a half-pipe-like leaf1 mutant that exhibits a curled leaf phenotype.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	Leaf forms are diverse in angiosperms, and different types of cells are differentiated depending on the species. Rice leaves are composed of a leaf blade, a leaf sheath and the junction region between them. Cells with characteristic features, such as bulliform cells and sclerenchyma cells, are differentiated in the leaf blade, together with standard epidermal and mesophyll cells. To understand the genetic mechanism underlying leaf morphogenesis in rice, we focused on a mutant, half-pipe-like leaf1 (hal1), whose leaves are adaxially curled. Histological observation revealed that the bulliform cells, which are responsible for leaf rolling under dry conditions, were small in size and abnormal in shape in a semidominant hal1-d mutant. Bulliform cell files were often ambiguous in semi-transparent hal1-d leaves cleared by the TOMEI method, suggesting that the bulliform cells were undeveloped. Therefore, a reduction in the growth of the bulliform cells seemed to be a major cause of leaf curling in the hal1-d mutant. The hal1-d mutation also affected the size of the leaf blade and the spikelet.
28608803	The Unique Role of the ECERIFERUM2-LIKE Clade of the BAHD Acyltransferase Superfamily in Cuticular Wax Metabolism.	2017	Plants (Basel)	The elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids is a conserved process used for the production of many metabolites, including plant cuticular waxes. The elongation of precursors of the most abundant cuticular wax components of some plants, however, is unique in requiring ECERIFERUM2-LIKE (CER2-LIKE) proteins. CER2-LIKEs are a clade within the BAHD superfamily of acyltransferases. They are known to be required for cuticular wax production in both Arabidopsis and maize based on mutant studies. Heterologous expression of Arabidopsis and rice CER2-LIKEs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has demonstrated that they modify the chain-length specificity of elongation when paired with particular condensing enzymes. Despite sequence homology, CER2-LIKEs are distinct from the BAHD superfamily in that they do not appear to use acyl transfer activity to fulfill their biological function. Here, we review the discovery and characterization of CER2-LIKEs, propose several models to explain their function, and explore the importance of CER2-LIKE proteins for the evolution of plant cuticles.
28640974	RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8.1 boosts pattern-triggered immunity against multiple pathogens in Arabidopsis and rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	The Arabidopsis gene RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8.1 (RPW8.1) confers resistance to virulent fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause powdery mildew and downy mildew, respectively. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that ectopic expression of RPW8.1 boosts pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) resulting in enhanced resistance against different pathogens in both Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, transcriptome analysis revealed that ectopic expression of RPW8.1-YFP constitutively up-regulates expression of many pathogen-associated molecular pattern-(PAMP-) inducible genes. Consistently, upon PAMP application, the transgenic line expressing RPW8.1-YFP exhibited more pronounced PTI responses such as callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species, expression of defense-related genes and hypersensitive response-like cell death. Accordingly, the growth of a virulent bacterial pathogen was significantly inhibited in the transgenic lines expressing RPW8.1-YFP. Conversely, impairment of the PTI signaling pathway from PAMP cognition to the immediate downstream relay of phosphorylation abolished or significantly compromised RPW8.1-boosted PTI responses. In rice, heterologous expression of RPW8.1-YFP also led to enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, our data suggest a surprising mechanistic connection between RPW8.1 function and PTI, and demonstrate the potential of RPW8.1 as a transgene for engineering disease resistance across wide taxonomic lineages of plants.

28663756	Transcriptional Network Analysis Reveals Drought Resistance Mechanisms of AP2/ERF Transgenic Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	This study was designed to investigate at the molecular level how a transgenic version of rice "Nipponbare" obtained a drought-resistant phenotype. Using multi-omics sequencing data, we compared wild-type rice (WT) and a transgenic version (erf71) that had obtained a drought-resistant phenotype by overexpressing OsERF71, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor (TF) family. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis pipeline, including TF networks and a cascade tree, was developed for the analysis of multi-omics data. The results of the analysis showed that the presence of OsERF71 at the source of the network controlled global gene expression levels in a specific manner to make erf71 survive longer than WT. Our analysis of the time-series transcriptome data suggests that erf71 diverted more energy to survival-critical mechanisms related to translation, oxidative response, and DNA replication, while further suppressing energy-consuming mechanisms, such as photosynthesis. To support this hypothesis further, we measured the net photosynthesis level under physiological conditions, which confirmed the further suppression of photosynthesis in erf71. In summary, our work presents a comprehensive snapshot of transcriptional modification in transgenic rice and shows how this induced the plants to acquire a drought-resistant phenotype.
28627335	Effects of exposure pathways on the accumulation and phytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles in soybean and rice.	2017	Nanotoxicology	The widespread use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) raises concerns both about their accumulation in crops and human exposure via crop consumption. Plants take up AgNPs through their leaves and roots, but foliar uptake has been largely ignored. To better understand AgNPs-plant interactions, we compared the uptake, phytotoxicity and size distribution of AgNPs in soybean and rice following root versus foliar exposure. At similar AgNP application levels, foliar exposure led to 17-200 times more Ag bioaccumulation than root exposure. Root but not foliar exposure significantly reduced plant biomass, while root exposure increased the malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents of leaves to a larger extent than did foliar exposure. Following either root or foliar exposure, Ag-containing NPs larger (36.0-48.9 nm) than the originally dosed NPs (17-18 nm) were detected within leaves. These particles were detected using a newly developed macerozyme R-10 tissue extraction method followed by single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In response to foliar exposure, these NPs were stored in the cell wall and plamalemma of leaves. NPs were also detected in planta following Ag ion exposure, indicating their in vivo formation. Leaf-to-leaf and root-to-leaf translocation of NPs in planta was observed but the former did not alter the size distribution of the NPs. Our observations point to the possibility that fruits, seeds and other edible parts may become contaminated by translocation processes in plants exposed to AgNPs. These results are an important contribution to improve the risk assessment of NPs under environmental exposure scenarios.
28605576	Increasing the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9-VQR precise genome editing in rice.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) is a revolutionary technology that enables efficient genomic modification in many organisms. Currently, the wide use of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) primarily recognizes sites harbouring a canonical NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The newly developed VQR (D1135V/R1335Q/T1337R) variant of Cas9 has been shown to cleave sites containing NGA PAM in rice, which greatly expanded the range of genome editing. However, the low editing efficiency of the VQR variant remains, which limits its wide application in genome editing. In this study, by modifying the single guide RNA (sgRNA) structure and strong endogenous promoters, we significantly increased the editing efficiency of the VQR variant. The modified CRISPR-Cas9-VQR system provides a robust toolbox for multiplex genome editing at sites containing noncanonical NGA PAM.
28636095	Suppression or knockout of SaF/SaM overcomes the Sa-mediated hybrid male sterility in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Hybrids between the indica and japonica subspecies of rice (Oryza sativa) are usually sterile, which hinders utilization of heterosis in the inter-subspecific hybrid breeding. The complex locus Sa comprises two adjacently located genes, SaF and SaM, which interact to cause abortion of pollen grains carrying the japonica allele in japonica-indica hybrids. Here we showed that silencing of SaF or SaM by RNA interference restored male fertility in indica-japonica hybrids with heterozygous Sa. We further used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing to knockout the SaF and SaM alleles, respectively, of an indica rice line to create hybrid-compatible lines. The resultant artificial neutral alleles did not affect pollen viability and other agricultural traits, but did break down the reproductive barrier in the hybrids. We found that some rice lines have natural neutral allele Sa-n, which was compatible with the typical japonica or indica Sa alleles in hybrids. Our results demonstrate that SaF and SaM are required for hybrid male sterility, but are not essential for pollen development. This study provides effective approaches for the generation of hybrid-compatible lines by knocking out the Sa locus or using the natural Sa-n allele to overcome hybrid male sterility in rice breeding. © 2017 The Authors.

28633293	The Tonoplast-Localized Transporter MTP8.2 Contributes to Manganese Detoxification in the Shoots and Roots of Oryza sativa L.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Manganese (Mn) cation diffusion facilitators (Mn-CDFs) play important roles in the Mn homeostasis of plants. In rice, the tonoplast-localized Mn-CDF metal tolerance protein 8.1 (MTP8.1) is involved in Mn detoxification in the shoots. This study functionally characterized the Mn-CDF MTP8.2 and determined its contribution to Mn tolerance. MTP8.2 was found to share 68% identity with MTP8.1 and was expressed in both the shoots and roots, but its transcription level was lower than that of MTP8.1. Transient expression of the MTP8.2:green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein and immunoblotting studies indicated that MTP8.2 was also localized to the tonoplast. MTP8.2 expression in yeast conferred tolerance to Mn but not to Fe, Zn, Co, Ni or Cd. MTP8.2 knockdown caused further growth reduction of shoots and roots in the mtp8.1 mutant, which already exhibits stunted growth under conditions of excess Mn. In the presence of high Mn, the MTP8.2 knockdown lines of the mtp8.1 mutant showed lower root Mn concentrations, as well as lower root:total Mn ratios, than those of wild-type rice and the mtp8.1 mutant. These findings indicate that MTP8.2 mediates Mn tolerance along with MTP8.1 through the sequestration of Mn into the shoot and root vacuoles.
28642772	Assessment of Five Chilling Tolerance Traits and GWAS Mapping in Rice Using the USDA Mini-Core Collection.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is often exposed to cool temperatures during spring planting in temperate climates. A better understanding of genetic pathways regulating chilling tolerance will enable breeders to develop varieties with improved tolerance during germination and young seedling stages. To dissect chilling tolerance, five assays were developed; one assay for the germination stage, one assay for the germination and seedling stage, and three for the seedling stage. Based on these assays, five chilling tolerance indices were calculated and assessed using 202 O. sativa accessions from the Rice Mini-Core (RMC) collection. Significant differences between RMC accessions made the five indices suitable for genome-wide association study (GWAS) based quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. For young seedling stage indices, japonica and indica subspecies clustered into chilling tolerant and chilling sensitive accessions, respectively, while both subspecies had similar low temperature germinability distributions. Indica subspecies were shown to have chilling acclimation potential. GWAS mapping uncovered 48 QTL at 39 chromosome regions distributed across all 12 rice chromosomes. Interestingly, there was no overlap between the germination and seedling stage QTL. Also, 18 QTL and 32 QTL were in regions discovered in previously reported bi-parental and GWAS based QTL mapping studies, respectively. Two novel low temperature seedling survivability (LTSS)-QTL, qLTSS3-4 and qLTSS4-1, were not in a previously reported QTL region. QTL with strong effect alleles identified in this study will be useful for marker assisted breeding efforts to improve chilling tolerance in rice cultivars and enhance gene discovery for chilling tolerance.
28607371	Single-point Mutation of an Histidine-aspartic Domain-containing Gene involving in Chloroplast Ribosome Biogenesis Leads to White Fine Stripe Leaf in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Plant leaves are a crucial organ associated closely with chloroplast development, photosynthesis rate and crop productivity. In this study, a white fine stripe leaf 1 (wfsl1) mutant was isolated and characterized from the japonica rice Zhonghua11 (ZH11) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. The wfsl1 displayed white fine stripe leaves since tillering stage and abnormal chloroplast structure. Map-based cloning and Bioinformatic analysis indicated that WFSL1 on chromosome 1 contains an "A" to "T" substitution in protein coding region, and encodes a putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolase with HD domain at the N-terminus. WFSL1 was targeted to the chloroplasts and had higher expression in mature leaves and sheaths. RNA-seq analysis revealed that chloroplast development and photosynthesis genes were significantly affected in wfsl1 plants. Levels of WFSL1 and chloroplast encoded proteins were decreased in wfsl1 mutants via western blot analysis. Compared with WT, wfsl1 exhibits lower Chl content and defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes, which resulted in reduced grain yield. Taken together, our results show that WFSL1 is critical for chloroplast development, ribosome biogenesis, and light energy utilization, finally affects grain yield.
28611462	Highly phosphorylated functionalized rice starch produced by transgenic rice expressing the potato GWD1 gene.	2017	Sci Rep	Starch phosphorylation occurs naturally during starch metabolism in the plant and is catalysed by glucan water dikinases (GWD1) and phosphoglucan water dikinase/glucan water dikinase 3 (PWD/GWD3). We generated six stable individual transgenic lines by over-expressing the potato GWD1 in rice. Transgenic rice grain starch had 9-fold higher 6-phospho (6-P) monoesters and double amounts of 3-phospho (3-P) monoesters, respectively, compared to control grain. The shape and topography of the transgenic starch granules were moderately altered including surface pores and less well defined edges. The gelatinization temperatures of both rice flour and extracted starch were significantly lower than those of the control and hence negatively correlated with the starch phosphate content. The 6-P content was positively correlated with amylose content and relatively long amylopectin chains with DP25-36, and the 3-P content was positively correlated with short chains of DP6-12. The starch pasting temperature, peak viscosity and the breakdown were lower but the setback was higher for transgenic rice flour. The 6-P content was negatively correlated with texture adhesiveness but positively correlated with the cohesiveness of rice flour gels. Our data demonstrate a way forward to employ a starch bioengineering approach for clean modification of starch, opening up completely new applications for rice starch.
28854638	Whole Genome Sequencing Reveals the Islands of Novel Polymorphisms in Two Native Aromatic Japonica Rice Landraces from Vietnam.	2017	Genome Biol Evol	Elucidation of the rice genome will not only broaden our understanding of genetic characterization of the agronomic characteristics but also facilitate the rice genetic improvement through marker assisted breeding. However, the genome resources of aromatic rice varieties are largely unexploited. Therefore, the whole genome of two elite aromatic traditional japonica rice landraces in North Vietnam, Tam Xoan Bac Ninh (TXBN), and Tam Xoan Hai Hau (TXHH), was sequenced to identify their genome-wide polymorphisms. Overall, we identified over 40,000 novel polymorphisms in each aromatic rice landrace. Although a discontinuous 8-bp deletion and an A/T SNP just upstream the 5-bp deletion in exon 7 of BADH2 gene were present in both rice landraces, the number of SNP high resolution regions of TXBN was six times higher than that of TXHH. Furthermore, several hot spot regions of novel SNPs and indels were found in both genomes, providing their potential gene pools related to aroma formation. The genomic information of two aromatic rice landraces described in this study will facilitate the identification of fragrance-related genes and the genetic improvement of rice.
28572585	Gene-body CG methylation and divergent expression of duplicate genes in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Gene and genome duplication fosters genetic novelty, but redundant gene copies would undergo mutational decay unless preserved via selective or neutral forces. Molecular mechanisms mediating duplicate preservation remain incompletely understood. Several recent studies showed an association between DNA methylation and expression divergence of duplicated genes and suggested a role of epigenetic mechanism in duplicate retention. Here, we compare genome-wide gene-body CG methylation (BCGM) and duplicate gene expression between a rice mutant null for OsMet1-2(a major CG methytransferase in rice) and its isogenic wild-type. We demonstrate a causal link between BCGM divergence and expression difference of duplicate copies. Interestingly, the higher- and lower-expressing copies of duplicates as separate groups show broadly different responses with respect to direction of expression alteration upon loss of BCGM. A role for BCGM in conditioning expression divergence between copies of duplicates generally holds for duplicates generated by whole genome duplication (WGD) or by small-scale duplication processes. However, differences are evident among these categories, including a higher proportion of WGD duplicates manifesting expression alteration, and differential propensities to lose BCGM by the higher- and lower-expression copies in the mutant. Together, our results support the notion that differential epigenetic marking may facilitate long-term retention of duplicate genes.
28584922	Deletion of a target gene in Indica rice via CRISPR/Cas9.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Using CRISPR/Cas9, we successfully deleted large fragments of the yield-related gene DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 in Indica rice at relatively high frequency and generated gain-of-function dep1 mutants. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 is a rapidly developing technology used to produce gene-specific modifications in both mammalian and plant systems. Most CRISPR-induced modifications in plants reported to date have been small insertions or deletions. Few large target gene deletions have thus far been reported, especially for Indica rice. In this study, we designed multiple CRISPR sgRNAs and successfully deleted DNA fragments in the gene DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 (DEP1) in the elite Indica rice line IR58025B. We achieved deletion frequencies of up to 21% for a 430 bp target and 9% for a 10 kb target among T0 events. Constructs with four sgRNAs did not generate higher full-length deletion frequencies than constructs with two sgRNAs. The multiple mutagenesis frequency reached 93% for four targets, and the homozygous mutation frequency reached 21% at the T0 stage. Important yield-related trait characteristics, such as dense and erect panicles and reduced plant height, were observed in dep1 homozygous T0 mutant plants produced by CRISPR/Cas9. Therefore, we successfully obtained deletions in DEP1 in the Indica background using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing tool at relatively high frequency.
28666057	Silencing OsSLR1 enhances the resistance of rice to the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	DELLA proteins, negative regulators of the gibberellin (GA) pathway, play important roles in plant growth, development and pathogen resistance by regulating multiple phytohormone signals. Yet, whether and how they regulate plant herbivore resistance remain unknown. We found that the expression of the rice DELLA gene OsSLR1 was down-regulated by an infestation of female adults of the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens. On one hand, OsSLR1 positively regulated BPH-induced levels of two mitogen-activated protein kinase and four WRKY transcripts, and of jasmonic acid, ethylene and H2 O2 . On the other hand, silencing OsSLR1 enhanced constitutive levels of defence-related compounds, phenolic acids, lignin and cellulose, as well as the resistance of rice to BPH in the laboratory and in the field. The increased resistance in rice with silencing of OsSLR1 is probably due to impaired JA and ethylene pathways, and, at least in part, to the increased lignin level and mechanical hardness of rice leaf sheaths. Our findings illustrate that OsSLR1, acting as an early negative regulator, plays an important role in regulating the resistance of rice to BPH by activating appropriate defence-related signalling pathways and compounds. Moreover, our data also provide new insights into relationships between plant growth and defence.
28592253	iTRAQ-based proteome profile analysis of superior and inferior Spikelets at early grain filling stage in japonica Rice.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Large-panicle rice varieties often fail to achieve their yield potential due to poor grain filling of late-flowering inferior spikelets (IS). The physiological and molecular mechanisms of poor IS grain filling, and whether an increase in assimilate supply could regulate protein abundance and consequently improve IS grain filling for japonica rice with large panicles is still partially understood.

RESULTS: A field experiment was performed with two spikelet removal treatments at anthesis in the large-panicle japonica rice line W1844, including removal of the top 1/3 of spikelets (T1) and removal of the top 2/3 of spikelets (T2), with no spikelet removal as a control (T0). The size, weight, setting rate, and grain filling rate of IS were significantly increased after spikelet removing. The biological functions of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between superior and inferior spikelets as well as the response of IS to the removal of superior spikelets (SS) were investigated by using iTRAQ at 10 days post anthesis. A total of 159, 87, and 28 DEPs were identified from group A (T0-SS/T0-IS), group B (T0-SS/T2-IS), and group C (T2-IS/T0-IS), respectively. Among these, 104, 63, and 22 proteins were up-regulated, and 55, 24, and 6 proteins were down-regulated, respectively. Approximately half of these DEPs were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (sucrose-to-starch metabolism and energy metabolism) and protein metabolism (protein synthesis, folding, degradation, and storage).

CONCLUSIONS: Reduced endosperm cell division and decreased activities of key enzymes associated with sucrose-starch metabolism and nitrogen metabolism are mainly attributed to the poor sink strength of IS. In addition, due to weakened photosynthesis and respiration, IS are unable to obtain a timely supply of materials and energy after fertilization, which might be resulted in the stagnation of IS development. Finally, an increased abundance of 14-3-3 protein in IS could be involved in the inhibition of starch synthesis. The removal of SS contributed to transfer of assimilates to IS and enhanced enzymatic activities of carbon metabolism (sucrose synthase, starch branching enzyme, soluble starch synthase, and pullulanase) and nitrogen metabolism (aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase), promoting starch and protein synthesis in IS. In addition, improvements in energy metabolism (greater abundance of pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase) might be played a vital role in inducing the initiation of grain filling. These results collectively demonstrate that carbohydrate supply is the main cause of poor IS grain filling.
28582424	Allelic variants of OsHKT1;1 underlie the divergence between indica and japonica subspecies of rice (Oryza sativa) for root sodium content.	2017	PLoS Genet	Salinity is a major factor limiting crop productivity. Rice (Oryza sativa), a staple crop for the majority of the world, is highly sensitive to salinity stress. To discover novel sources of genetic variation for salt tolerance-related traits in rice, we screened 390 diverse accessions under 14 days of moderate (9 dS·m-1) salinity. In this study, shoot growth responses to moderate levels of salinity were independent of tissue Na+ content. A significant difference in root Na+ content was observed between the major subpopulations of rice, with indica accessions displaying higher root Na+ and japonica accessions exhibiting lower root Na+ content. The genetic basis of the observed variation in phenotypes was elucidated through genome-wide association (GWA). The strongest associations were identified for root Na+:K+ ratio and root Na+ content in a region spanning ~575 Kb on chromosome 4, named Root Na+ Content 4 (RNC4). Two Na+ transporters, HKT1;1 and HKT1;4 were identified as candidates for RNC4. Reduced expression of both HKT1;1 and HKT1;4 through RNA interference indicated that HKT1;1 regulates shoot and root Na+ content, and is likely the causal gene underlying RNC4. Three non-synonymous mutations within HKT1;1 were present at higher frequency in the indica subpopulation. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes the indica-predominant isoform exhibited higher inward (negative) currents and a less negative voltage threshold of inward rectifying current activation compared to the japonica-predominant isoform. The introduction of a 4.5kb fragment containing the HKT1;1 promoter and CDS from an indica variety into a japonica background, resulted in a phenotype similar to the indica subpopulation, with higher root Na+ and Na+:K+. This study provides evidence that HKT1;1 regulates root Na+ content, and underlies the divergence in root Na+ content between the two major subspecies in rice.
28607357	Genome-wide association study of outcrossing in cytoplasmic male sterile lines of rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Stigma exsertion and panicle enclosure of male sterile lines are two key determinants of outcrossing in hybrid rice seed production. Based on 43,394 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, 217 cytoplasmic male sterile lines were assigned into two subpopulations and a mixed-group where the linkage disequilibrium decay distances varied from 975 to 2,690 kb. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed for stigma exsertion rate (SE), panicle enclosure rate (PE) and seed-setting rate (SSR). A total of 154 significant association signals (P < 0.001) were identified. They were situated in 27 quantitative trait loci (QTLs), including 11 for SE, 6 for PE, and 10 for SSR. It was shown that six of the ten QTLs for SSR were tightly linked to QTLs for SE or/and PE with the expected allelic direction. These QTL clusters could be targeted to improve the outcrossing of female parents in hybrid rice breeding. Our study also indicates that GWAS-base QTL mapping can complement and enhance previous QTL information for understanding the genetic relationship between outcrossing and its related traits.
28640934	Substrate specificity and safener inducibility of the plant UDP-glucose-dependent family 1 glycosyltransferase super-family.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Plants contain large numbers of family 1 UDP-glucose-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs), including members that conjugate xenobiotics. Arabidopsis contains 107 UGT genes with 99 family members successfully expressed as glutathione transferase (GST)-fusion proteins in E. coli. A high-throughput catalytic screen was developed based on quantification of the fusion by measuring GST activity. UGT activity using UDP-glucose as donor was then determined using 11 synthetic acceptors bearing hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups that had been shown to undergo conjugation in plant extracts. In total, 44 UGTs, largely members of the D and E groups, were active towards xenobiotics, glucosylating phenol and thiol acceptors. In contrast, N-glucosyltransferase (NGT) activity was almost exclusively restricted to a single enzyme, UGT72B1. Using DNA microarrays, the induction of UGT transcripts following treatment with the herbicide safener fenclorim was compared in Arabidopsis and rice. D and L group members were the most safener-inducible UGTs in both species. The respective Arabidopsis enzymes showed low conjugating activity towards xenobiotics. Using Genevestigator, a small group of safened D and L UGTs were consistently induced in response to biotic and abiotic stress suggestive of protective activities beyond xenobiotic detoxification in both species. The induction of other detoxifying gene families following treatment with fenclorim, namely cytochromes P450 and glutathione transferases, further confirmed the selective enhancement of related subfamily members in the two species giving new insight into the safening response in cereals, where herbicide tolerance is enhanced compared with dicots, which are unresponsive to these treatments.
28634483	Elicitor-Induced Biochemical and Molecular Manifestations to Improve Drought Tolerance in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) through Seed-Priming.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the major grain cereals of the Indian subcontinent which face water-deficit stress for their cultivation. Seed-priming has been reported to be a useful approach to complement stress responses in plants. In the present study, seed-priming with hormonal or chemical elicitor [viz. methyl jasmonate (MJ), salicylic acid (SA), paclobutrazol (PB)] showed significant increase in total phenolic content, antioxidant activity and expression of Rice Drought-responsive (RD1 and RD2) genes (of AP2/ERF family) in contrasting rice genotypes (Nagina-22, drought-tolerant and Pusa Sugandh-5, drought-sensitive) under drought stress. However, decrease in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation was observed not only under the stress but also under control condition in the plants raised from primed seeds. Expression analyses of RD1 and RD2 genes showed upregulated expression in the plants raised from primed seeds under drought stress. Moreover, the RD2 gene and the drought-sensitive genotype showed better response than that of the RD1 gene and the drought-tolerant genotype in combating the effects of drought stress. Among the elicitors, MJ was found to be the most effective for seed-priming, followed by PB and SA. Growth and development of the plants raised from primed seeds were found to be better under control and drought stress conditions compared to that of the plants raised from unprimed seeds under the stress. The present study suggests that seed-priming could be one of the useful approaches to be explored toward the development of simple, cost-effective and farmer-friendly technology to enhance rice yield in rainfed areas.
28624908	Development and validation of KASP markers for the greenbug resistance gene Gb7 and the Hessian fly resistance gene H32 in wheat.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Greenbug and Hessian fly are important pests that decrease wheat production worldwide. We developed and validated breeder-friendly KASP markers for marker-assisted breeding to increase selection efficiency. Greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] are two major destructive insect pests of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) throughout wheat production regions in the USA and worldwide. Greenbug and Hessian fly infestation can significantly reduce grain yield and quality. Breeding for resistance to these two pests using marker-assisted selection (MAS) is the most economical strategy to minimize losses. In this study, doubled haploid lines from the Synthetic W7984 × Opata M85 wheat reference population were used to construct linkage maps for the greenbug resistance gene Gb7 and the Hessian fly resistance gene H32 with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and 90K array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data. Flanking markers were closely linked to Gb7 and H32 and were located on chromosome 7DL and 3DL, respectively. Gb7-linked markers (synopGBS773 and synopGBS1141) and H32-linked markers (synopGBS901 and IWB65911) were converted into Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays for MAS in wheat breeding. In addition, comparative mapping identified syntenic regions in Brachypodium distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) for Gb7 and H32 that can be used for fine mapping and map-based cloning of the genes. The KASP markers developed in this study are the first set of SNPs tightly linked to Gb7 and H32 and will be very useful for MAS in wheat breeding programs and future genetic studies of greenbug and Hessian fly resistance.
28706525	Functional Marker Assisted Improvement of Stable Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Lines of Rice for Bacterial Blight Resistance.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae is one among the major diseases in rice, which in severe condition cause losses up to 60% in total yield. Marker assisted pyramiding of three broad spectrum BB resistance genes (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) in prominent rice varieties is the most economical and effective strategy for the management of the BB disease. We report here the pyramiding of three genes (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) in maintainer lines (CO 2B, CO 23B, and CO 24B) of three promising wild abortive cytoplasmic male sterile lines (CO 2A, CO 23A, and CO 24A) through functional markers assisted back cross breeding. IRBB60 with xa5, xa13, and Xa21 genes is used as a donor parent. BC2F1 and BC2F2 generations from a cross of CO 2B, CO 23B, and CO 24B with IRBB60 were evaluated for bacterial blight and non-fertility restoration. In BC2F1, plants with all three resistance genes (xa5, xa13, and Xa21) and high parent genome recovery was identified. In BC2F2, plants with all resistance genes and without fertility restorer (Rf3 and Rf4) were selected. Based on agronomic traits, BB resistance and maintenance of sterility, two plants each in CO 2B × IRBB60, CO 24B × IRBB60 and one plant in CO 23B × IRBB60 combinations were identified. The identified lines were crossed with respective male sterile lines for conversion of improved B line into CMS line through back-crossing, in addition to selfing. The plants with high recurrent genome and phenotypically similar to parental lines and sterile are being used for the hybrid rice development program. Currently, using these lines (improved CMS line), test crosses were made to develop new rice hybrids. Hybrids combinations viz., CO 23A × AD08009R and CO 24A × IET20898R were found to be stable at different locations with high yield. The R line used in this study has been introgressed with xa5, xa13, and Xa21 genes in a separate breeding program. These new hybrids with resistance against bacterial blight will increase the crop production at BB environment.
28652621	Silicon amendment is involved in the induction of plant defense responses to a phloem feeder.	2017	Sci Rep	Plant resistance to herbivores is a key component in integrated pest management. In most cases, silicon (Si) amendment to plants enhances resistance to herbivorous insects. The increase of plant physical barrier and altered insect behaviors are proposed as mechanisms for the enhanced resistance in Si-amended plants, but our understanding of the induced mechanisms involved in Si-enhanced plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects remains unclear. Here, we show that Si amendment to rice (Oryza sativa) plants impacts multiple plant defense responses induced by a phloem-feeder, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens, BPH). Si amendment improved silicification of leaf sheaths that BPH feed on. Si addition suppressed the increase of malondialdehyde concentration while encouraged increase of H2O2 concentration in plants attacked by BPH. Higher activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were recorded in Si-amended than in non-amended BPH-infested plants. BPH infestation activated synthases for secondary metabolites, polyphenol oxidase and pheny-lalanine ammonia-lyase, and β-1,3-glucanase, but the activation was greater in Si-amended than in non-amended plants. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Si amendment interacts with BPH infestation in the induction of plant defense responses and consequently, to confer enhanced rice plant resistance.
28659945	Expression of the <i>Aeluropus littoralis AlSAP</i> Gene Enhances Rice Yield under Field Drought at the Reproductive Stage.	2017	Front Plant Sci	We evaluated the yields of Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare' rice lines expressing a gene encoding an A20/AN1 domain stress-associated protein, AlSAP, from the halophyte grass Aeluropus littoralis under the control of different promoters. Three independent field trials were conducted, with drought imposed at the reproductive stage. In all trials, the two transgenic lines, RN5 and RN6, consistently out-performed non-transgenic (NT) and wild-type (WT) controls, providing 50-90% increases in grain yield (GY). Enhancement of tillering and panicle fertility contributed to this improved GY under drought. In contrast with physiological records collected during previous greenhouse dry-down experiments, where drought was imposed at the early tillering stage, we did not observe significant differences in photosynthetic parameters, leaf water potential, or accumulation of antioxidants in flag leaves of AlSAP-lines subjected to drought at flowering. However, AlSAP expression alleviated leaf rolling and leaf drying induced by drought, resulting in increased accumulation of green biomass. Therefore, the observed enhanced performance of the AlSAP-lines subjected to drought at the reproductive stage can be tentatively ascribed to a primed status of the transgenic plants, resulting from a higher accumulation of biomass during vegetative growth, allowing reserve remobilization and maintenance of productive tillering and grain filling. Under irrigated conditions, the overall performance of AlSAP-lines was comparable with, or even significantly better than, the NT and WT controls. Thus, AlSAP expression inflicted no penalty on rice yields under optimal growth conditions. Our results support the use of AlSAP transgenics to reduce rice GY losses under drought conditions.
28657614	Genetic analysis of a hybrid sterility gene that causes both pollen and embryo sac sterility in hybrids between Oryza sativa L. and Oryza longistaminata.	2017	Heredity (Edinb)	Oryza longistaminata originates from African wild rice and contains valuable traits conferring tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. However, interspecific crosses between O. longistaminata and Oryza sativa cultivars are hindered by reproductive barriers. To dissect the mechanism of interspecific hybrid sterility, we developed a near-isogenic line (NIL) using indica variety RD23 as the recipient parent and O. longistaminata as the donor parent. Both pollen and embryo sac semi-sterility were observed in F1 hybrids between RD23 and NIL. Cytological analysis demonstrated that pollen abortion in F1 hybrids occurred at the early bi-nucleate stage due to a failure of the first mitosis in microspores. Partial embryo sacs in the F1 hybrids were defective during the functional megaspore formation stage. Most notably, nearly half of the male or female gametes were aborted in heterozygotes S40iS40l, regardless of their genotypes. Thus, S40 was indicated as a one-locus sporophytic sterility gene controlling both male and female fertility in hybrids between RD23 and O. longistaminata. A population of 16 802 plants derived from the hybrid RD23/NIL-S40 was developed to fine-map S40. Finally, the S40 locus was delimited to an 80-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 1 in terms with reference sequences of cv. 93-11. Eight open reading frames (ORFs) were localized in this region. On the basis of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis, ORF5 and ORF8 were identified as candidate genes for the S40 locus. These results are helpful in cloning the S40 gene and marker-assisted transferring of the corresponding neutral allele in rice breeding programs.
28597326	Identification of bakanae disease resistance loci in japonica rice through genome wide association study.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Bakanae disease, caused by seed-borne Fusarium species, mainly F. fujikuroi, is a rice disease whose importance is considerably increasing in several rice growing countries, leading to incremental production losses.

RESULTS: A germplasm collection of japonica rice was screened for F. fujikuroi resistance, allowing the identification of accessions with high-to-moderate levels of resistance to bakanae. A GWAS approach uncovered two genomic regions highly associated with the observed phenotypic variation for response to bakanae infection on the short arm of chromosome 1 (named as qBK1_628091) and on the long arm of chromosome 4 (named as qBK4_31750955). High levels of phenotypic resistance to bakanae were associated to the cumulated presence of the resistant alleles at the two resistance loci, suggesting that they can provide useful levels of disease protection in resistance breeding. A fine comparison with the genomic positions of qBK1_628091 and qBK4_31750955 with respect to the QTLs for bakanae resistance reported in the literature suggests that the resistant loci here described represent new genomic regions associated to F. fujikuroi resistance. A search for candidate genes with a putative role in bakanae resistance was conducted considering all the annotated genes and F. fujikuroi-related DEGs included in the two genomic regions highlighting several gene functions that could be involved in resistance, thus paving the way to the functional characterization of the resistance loci.

CONCLUSIONS: New effective sources for bakanae resistance were identified on rice chromosomes 1 and 4 and tools for resistance breeding are provided.
28666113	A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance.	2017	Cell	Rice feeds half the world's population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.
28713404	Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of Genes, Conserved between <i>japonica</i> and <i>indica</i> Rice Cultivars, that Respond to Low-Temperature Stress at the Vegetative Growth Stage.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Cold stress is very detrimental to crop production. However, only a few genes in rice have been identified with known functions related to cold tolerance. To meet this agronomic challenge more effectively, researchers must take global approaches to select useful candidate genes and find the major regulatory factors. We used five Gene expression omnibus series data series of Affymetrix array data, produced with cold stress-treated samples from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and identified 502 cold-inducible genes common to both japonica and indica rice cultivars. From them, we confirmed that the expression of two randomly chosen genes was increased by cold stress in planta. In addition, overexpression of OsWRKY71 enhanced cold tolerance in 'Dongjin,' the tested japonica cultivar. Comparisons between japonica and indica rice, based on calculations of plant survival rates and chlorophyll fluorescence, confirmed that the japonica rice was more cold-tolerant. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicate that the 'L-phenylalanine catabolic process,' within the Biological Process category, was the most highly overrepresented under cold-stress conditions, implying its significance in that response in rice. MapMan analysis classified 'Major Metabolic' processes and 'Regulatory Gene Modules' as two other major determinants of the cold-stress response and suggested several key cis-regulatory elements. Based on these results, we proposed a model that includes a pathway for cold stress-responsive signaling. Results from our functional analysis of the main signal transduction and transcription regulation factors identified in that pathway will provide insight into novel regulatory metabolism(s), as well as a foundation by which we can develop crop plants with enhanced cold tolerance.
28184437	An accurate and efficient method for large-scale SSR genotyping and applications.	2017	Nucleic Acids Res	Accurate and efficient genotyping of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) constitutes the basis of SSRs as an effective genetic marker with various applications. However, the existing methods for SSR genotyping suffer from low sensitivity, low accuracy, low efficiency and high cost. In order to fully exploit the potential of SSRs as genetic marker, we developed a novel method for SSR genotyping, named as AmpSeq-SSR, which combines multiplexing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), targeted deep sequencing and comprehensive analysis. AmpSeq-SSR is able to genotype potentially more than a million SSRs at once using the current sequencing techniques. In the current study, we simultaneously genotyped 3105 SSRs in eight rice varieties, which were further validated experimentally. The results showed that the accuracies of AmpSeq-SSR were nearly 100 and 94% with a single base resolution for homozygous and heterozygous samples, respectively. To demonstrate the power of AmpSeq-SSR, we adopted it in two applications. The first was to construct discriminative fingerprints of the rice varieties using 3105 SSRs, which offer much greater discriminative power than the 48 SSRs commonly used for rice. The second was to map Xa21, a gene that confers persistent resistance to rice bacterial blight. We demonstrated that genome-scale fingerprints of an organism can be efficiently constructed and candidate genes, such as Xa21 in rice, can be accurately and efficiently mapped using an innovative strategy consisting of multiplexing PCR, targeted sequencing and computational analysis. While the work we present focused on rice, AmpSeq-SSR can be readily extended to animals and micro-organisms.
28659583	Trait-based model development to support breeding programs. A case study for salt tolerance and rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Eco-physiological models are increasingly used to analyze G × E × M interactions to support breeding programs via the design of ideotypes for specific contexts. However, available crop models are only partly suitable for this purpose, since they often lack clear relationships between parameters and traits breeders are working on. Taking salt stress tolerance and rice as a case study, we propose a paradigm shift towards the building of ideotyping-specific models explicitly around traits involved in breeding programs. Salt tolerance is a complex trait relying on different physiological processes that can be alternatively selected to improve the overall crop tolerance. We developed a new model explicitly accounting for these traits and we evaluated its performance using data from growth chamber experiments (e.g., R2 ranged from 0.74 to 0.94 for the biomass of different plant organs). Using the model, we were able to show how an increase in the overall tolerance can derive from completely different physiological mechanisms according to soil/water salinity dynamics. The study demonstrated that a trait-based approach can increase the usefulness of mathematical models for supporting breeding programs.
28674278	Genetic characterization and fine mapping of S25, a hybrid male sterility gene, on rice chromosome 12.	2017	Genes Genet Syst	Hybrid male sterility genes are important factors in creating postzygotic reproductive isolation barriers in plants. One such gene, S25, is known to cause severe transmission ratio distortion in inter-subspecific progeny of cultivated rice Oryza sativa ssp. indica and japonica. To further characterize the S25 gene, we fine-mapped and genetically characterized the S25 gene using near-isogenic lines with reciprocal genetic backgrounds. We mapped the S25 locus within a 0.67-1.02 Mb region on rice chromosome 12. Further genetic analyses revealed that S25 substantially reduced male fertility in the japonica background, but not in the indica background. In first-generation hybrid progeny, S25 had a milder effect than it had in the japonica background. These results suggest that the expression of S25 is epistatically regulated by at least one partially dominant gene present in the indica genome. This finding supports our previous studies showing that hybrid male sterility due to pollen killer genes results from epistatic interaction with other genes that are hidden in the genetic background.
28690618	Identification of Major Effect QTLs for Agronomic Traits and CSSLs in Rice from Swarna/<i>Oryza nivara</i> Derived Backcross Inbred Lines.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from elite x wild crosses are very useful for basic studies and breeding. The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with yield and related traits and to identify chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs) from unselected BC2F8 BILs of Swarna/Oryza nivara IRGC81848. In all, 94 BILs were field evaluated in 2 years (wet seasons, 2014 and 2015) for nine traits; days to 50% flowering, days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), number of tillers, number of productive tillers, panicle weight, yield per plant, bulk yield, and biomass. BILs were genotyped using 111 polymorphic simple sequence repeats distributed across the genome. Fifteen QTLs including 10 novel QTLs were identified using composite interval mapping, Inclusive composite interval mapping and multiple interval mapping (MIM). O. nivara alleles were trait-enhancing in 26% of QTLs. Only 3 of 15 QTLs were also reported previously in BC2F2 of the same cross. These three included the two major effect QTLs for DM and PH detected in both years with 13 and 20% phenotypic variance. Further, a set of 74 CSSLs was identified using CSSL Finder and 22 of these showed significantly higher values than Swarna for five yield traits. CSSLs, 220S for panicle weight and 10-2S with consistent high yield in both years are worthy of large scale field evaluation. The major QTLs and 22 significantly different CSSLs are a useful resource for rice improvement and dissecting yield related traits.
28659941	Insight into MAS: A Molecular Tool for Development of Stress Resistant and Quality of Rice through Gene Stacking.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice yield is subjected to severe losses due to adverse effect of a number of stress factors. The most effective method of controlling reduced crop production is utilization of host resistance. Recent technological advances have led to the improvement of DNA based molecular markers closely linked to genes or QTLs in rice chromosome that bestow tolerance to various types of abiotic stresses and resistance to biotic stress factors. Transfer of several genes with potential characteristics into a single genotype is possible through the process of marker assisted selection (MAS), which can quicken the advancement of tolerant/resistant cultivars in the lowest number of generations with the utmost precision through the process of gene pyramiding. Overall, this review presented various types of molecular tools including MAS that can be reasonable and environmental friendly approach for the improvement of abiotic and biotic stress resistant rice with enhanced quality.
28649256	Evolutionary Insights Based on SNP Haplotypes of Red Pericarp, Grain Size and Starch Synthase Genes in Wild and Cultivated Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	The origin and domestication of rice has been a subject of considerable debate in the post-genomic era. Rice varieties have been categorized based on isozyme and DNA markers into two broad cultivar groups, Indica and Japonica. Among other well-known cultivar groups Aus varieties are closer to Indica and Aromatic varieties including Basmati are closer to Japonica, while deep-water rice varieties share kinship to both Indica and Japonica cultivar groups. Here, we analyzed haplotype networks and phylogenetic relationships in a diverse set of genotypes including Indian Oryza nivara/Oryza rufipogon wild rice accessions and representative varieties of four rice cultivar groups based on pericarp color (Rc), grain size (GS3) and eight different starch synthase genes (GBSSI, SSSI, SSIIa, SSIIb, SSIIIa, SSIIIb, SSIVa, and SSIVb). Aus cultivars appear to have the most ancient origin as they shared the maximum number of haplotypes with the wild rice populations, while Indica, Japonica and Aromatic cultivar groups showed varying phylogenetic origins of these genes. Starch synthase genes showed higher variability in cultivated rice than wild rice populations, suggesting diversified selection during and after domestication. O. nivara/O. rufipogon wild rice accessions belonging to different sub-populations shared common haplotypes for all the 10 genes analyzed. Our results support polyphyletic origin of cultivated rice with a complex pattern of migration of domestication alleles from wild to different rice cultivar groups. The findings provide novel insights into evolutionary and domestication history of rice and will help utilization of wild rice germplasm for genetic improvement of rice cultivars.
28676805	The Journey of Arsenic from Soil to Grain in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Arsenic (As) is a non-essential toxic metalloid whose elevated concentration in rice grains is a serious issue both for rice yield and quality, and for human health. The rice-As interactions, hence, have been studied extensively in past few decades. A deep understanding of factors influencing As uptake and transport from soil to grains can be helpful to tackle this issue so as to minimize grain As levels. As uptake at the root surface by rice plants depends on factors like iron plaque and radial oxygen loss. There is involvement of a number of transporters viz., phosphate transporters and aquaglyceroporins in the uptake and transport of different As species and in the movement to subcellular compartments. These processes are also affected by sulfur availability and consequently on the level of thiol (-SH)-containing As binding peptides viz., glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs). Further, the role of phloem in As movement to the grains is also suggested. This review presents a detailed map of journey of As from soil to the grains. The implications for the utilization of available knowledge in minimizing As in rice grains are presented.
28592653	Approaches in Characterizing Genetic Structure and Mapping in a Rice Multiparental Population.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Multi-parent Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) populations are fast becoming mainstream tools for research and breeding, along with the technology and tools for analysis. This paper demonstrates the analysis of a rice MAGIC population from data filtering to imputation and processing of genetic data to characterizing genomic structure, and finally quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In this study, 1316 S6:8 indica MAGIC (MI) lines and the eight founders were sequenced using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS). As the GBS approach often includes missing data, the first step was to impute the missing SNPs. The observable number of recombinations in the population was then explored. Based on this case study, a general outline of procedures for a MAGIC analysis workflow is provided, as well as for QTL mapping of agronomic traits and biotic and abiotic stress, using the results from both association and interval mapping approaches. QTL for agronomic traits (yield, flowering time, and plant height), physical (grain length and grain width) and cooking properties (amylose content) of the rice grain, abiotic stress (submergence tolerance), and biotic stress (brown spot disease) were mapped. Through presenting this extensive analysis in the MI population in rice, we highlight important considerations when choosing analytical approaches. The methods and results reported in this paper will provide a guide to future genetic analysis methods applied to multi-parent populations.
28647102	Boosting Rice Yield by Fine-Tuning SPL Gene Expression.	2017	Trends Plant Sci	Plant architecture is an important determinant of crop yield. Recent studies showed that SPL family genes regulate the architecture of rice plants. SPLs inhibit tillering in general, but promote panicle branching at optimal expression levels to increase grain number. Fine-tuning the expression of SPL genes may provide useful strategies for crop improvement.
28637931	Comparative miRomics of Salt-Tolerant and Salt-Sensitive Rice.	2017	J Integr Bioinform	Increase in soil salt causes osmotic and ionic stress to plants, which inhibits their growth and productivity. Rice production is also hampered by salinity and the effect of salt is most severe at the seedling and reproductive stages. Salainity tolerance is a quantitative property controlled by multiple genes coding for signaling molecules, ion transporters, metabolic enzymes and transcription regulators. MicroRNAs are key modulators of gene-expression that act at the post-transcriptional level by translation repression or transcript cleavage. They also play an important role in regulating plant's response to salt-stress. In this work we adopted the approach of comparative and integrated data-mining to understand the miRNA-mediated regulation of salt-stress in rice. We profiled and compared the miRNA regulations using natural varieties and transgenic lines with contrasting behaviors in response to salt-stress. The information obtained from sRNAseq, RNAseq and degradome datasets was integrated to identify the salt-deregulated miRNAs, their targets and the associated metabolic pathways. The analysis revealed the modulation of many biological pathways, which are involved in salt-tolerance and play an important role in plant phenotype and physiology. The end modifications of the miRNAs were also studied in our analysis and isomiRs having a dynamic role in salt-tolerance mechanism were identified.
28554479	Rice PcG gene OsEMF2b controls seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1.	2017	Plant Sci	The induction and release of seed dormancy are a precisely regulated process that influences seed germination. ABA promotes seed dormancy but suppresses seed germination and seedling growth. However, how chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms regulate the expression of ABA related genes during these processes remains unclear. Polycomb gene OsEMF2b was required for regulation of seed dormancy and seedling growth by dynamically activating and repressing ABA signal response genes. Downregulation of OsEMF2b led to vivipary and decreased expression level of OsVP1, which was involved in ABA signal pathway in seed dormancy. While, the seedlings with downregulation of OsEMF2b exhibited hyper-sensitive response to ABA and the expression of OsVP1 is upregulated. Yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP analyses proved that OsEMF2b could bind to the promoter of OsVP1 directly and affected H3K27me3 enrichments of OsVP1 in seedling. Interestingly, both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 enrichments of OsVP1 were changed with OsEMF2b mis-expression in seed and seedling. We proposed that OsEMF2b may play a pivotal role in seed dormancy and seedling growth by regulating the expression of OsVP1 indirectly or directly.
28795104	Microarray dataset of transgenic rice overexpressing <i>Abp57</i>.	2017	Data Brief	The dataset presented in this article describes microarray experiment of Auxin-binding protein 57, Abp57-overexpressing transgenic rice. The gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice (Cn) Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Total RNA from seedlings tissue of transgenic rice and wildtype, which serve as control were used as starting materials for microarray experiment. Detailed experimental methods and data analysis were described here. The raw and normalized microarray data were deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE99055.
28710664	Role of sodium ion transporters and osmotic adjustments in stress alleviation of Cynodon dactylon under NaCl treatment: a parallel investigation with rice.	2017	Protoplasma	Comparative analyses of the responses to NaCl in Cynodon dactylon and a sensitive crop species like rice could effectively unravel the salt tolerance mechanism in the former. C. dactylon, a wild perennial chloridoid grass having a wide range of ecological distribution is generally adaptable to varying degrees of salinity stress. The role of salt exclusion mechanism present exclusively in the wild grass was one of the major factors contributing to its tolerance. Salt exclusion was found to be induced at 4 days when the plants were treated with a minimum conc. of 200 mM NaCl. The structural peculiarities of the salt exuding glands were elucidated by the SEM and TEM studies, which clearly revealed the presence of a bicellular salt gland actively functioning under NaCl stress to remove the excess amount of Na+ ion from the mesophyll tissues. Moreover, the intracellular effect of NaCl on the photosynthetic apparatus was found to be lower in C. dactylon in comparison to rice; at the same time, the vacuolization process increased in the former. Accumulation of osmolytes like proline and glycine betaine also increased significantly in C. dactylon with a concurrent check on the H2O2 levels, electrolyte leakage and membrane lipid peroxidation. This accounted for the proper functioning of the Na+ ion transporters in the salt glands and also in the vacuoles for the exudation and loading of excess salts, respectively, to maintain the osmotic balance of the protoplasm. In real-time PCR analyses, CdSOS1 expression was found to increase by 2.5- and 5-fold, respectively, and CdNHX expression increased by 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, in plants subjected to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatment for 72 h. Thus, the comparative analyses of the expression pattern of the plasma membrane and tonoplast Na+ ion transporters, SOS1 and NHX in both the plants revealed the significant role of these two ion transporters in conferring salinity tolerance in Cynodon.
28554480	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	Tocopherols, a group of Vitamin E compounds, are essential components of the human diet. In contrast to well documented roles in animals, the functions of tocopherols in plants are less understood. In this study, we characterized two allelic rice dwarf mutant lines designated sgd1-1 and sgd1-2 (small grain and dwarf1). Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotypes were mainly due to cell elongation defects. A map-based cloning strategy and subsequent complementation test showed that SGD1 encodes homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis. Mutation of SGD1 resulted in tocopherol deficiency in both sgd1mutants. No oxidant damage was detected in the sgd1 mutants. Further analysis showed that sgd1-2 was hypersensitive to cold stress. Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.
28769961	Tightly Controlled Expression of <i>bHLH142</i> Is Essential for Timely Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Male sterility is important for hybrid seed production. Pollen development is regulated by a complex network. We previously showed that knockout of bHLH142 in rice (Oryza sativa) causes pollen sterility by interrupting tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and bHLH142 coordinates with TDR to modulate the expression of EAT1. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of bHLH142 (OE142) under the control of the ubiquitin promoter also leads to male sterility in rice by triggering the premature onset of PCD. Protein of bHLH142 was found to accumulate specifically in the OE142 anthers. Overexpression of bHLH142 induced early expression of several key regulatory transcription factors in pollen development. In particular, the upregulation of EAT1 at the early stage of pollen development promoted premature PCD in the OE142 anthers, while its downregulation at the late stage impaired pollen development by suppressing genes involved in pollen wall biosynthesis, ROS scavenging and PCD. Collectively, these events led to male sterility in OE142. Analyses of related mutants further revealed the hierarchy of the pollen development regulatory gene network. Thus, the findings of this study advance our understanding of the central role played by bHLH142 in the regulatory network leading to pollen development in rice and how overexpression of its expression affects pollen development. Exploitation of this novel functionality of bHLH142 may confer a big advantage to hybrid seed production.
28818384	Rice peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase knockdown affects ROS signaling and triggers early leaf senescence.	2017	Plant Sci	H2O2, which is continually produced by aerobic metabolism, is a cytotoxic molecule when in high levels. However, low levels can act as a signaling molecule able to regulate the expression of stress responses, senescence, programmed cell death, plant growth, and development. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) enzyme plays an essential role in the control of intracellular H2O2 levels. Here, the function of a gene encoding a peroxisomal APX (OsAPX4) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was studied. OsAPX4 gene expression can be detected in roots and panicles, but the highest expression level occurs in leaves. Silencing of OsAPX4 and OsAPX3 expression in RNAiOsAPX4 did not affect the growth of plants under growth chamber conditions, but aging transgenic plants interestingly displayed an early senescence phenotype. Leaf fragments from silenced plants were also more sensitive to induced senescence conditions. RNAiOsAPX4 plants did not present detectable changes in intracellular H2O2 levels, but biochemical analyses showed that transgenic plants displayed some decreased APX activity in the chloroplastic fraction. Also, the peroxisomal enzyme glycolate oxidase exhibited lower activity, whereas catalase activity was similar to non-transformed rice. The results imply that OsAPX4 gene has an important role in leaf senescence pathway mediated by ROS signaling.
28730413	Updating the elite rice variety Kongyu 131 by improving the Gn1a locus.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Kongyu 131 is an elite japonica rice variety of Heilongjiang Province, China. It has the characteristics of early maturity, superior quality, high yield, cold tolerance and wide adaptability. However, there is potential to improve the yield of Kongyu 131 because of the relatively few grains per panicle compared with other varieties. Hence, we rebuilt the genome of Kongyu 131 by replacing the GRAIN NUMBER1a (Gn1a) locus with a high-yielding allele from a big panicle indica rice variety, GKBR. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was used for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.

RESULTS: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the BC3F2 population showed that the introgressed segment carrying the Gn1a allele of GKBR significantly increased the branch number and grain number per panicle. Using 5 SNP markers designed against the sequence within and around Gn1a, the introgressed chromosome segment was shortened to approximately 430 Kb to minimize the linkage drag by screening recombinants in the target region. Genomic components of the new Kongyu 131 were detected using 220 SNP markers evenly distributed across 12 chromosomes, suggesting that the recovery ratio of the recurrent parent genome (RRPG) was 99.89%. Compared with Kongyu 131, the yield per plant of the new Kongyu 131 increased by 8.3% and 11.9% at Changchun and Jiamusi, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: To achieve the high yield potential of Kongyu 131, a minute chromosome fragment carrying the favorable Gn1a allele from the donor parent was introgressed into the genome of Kongyu 131, which resulted in a larger panicle and subsequent yield increase in the new Kongyu 131. These results indicate the feasibility of improving an undesirable trait of an elite variety by replacing only a small chromosome segment carrying a favorable allele.
28723953	Analysis of the differential gene and protein expression profile of the rolled leaf mutant of transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	PLoS One	The importance of leaf rolling in rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been widely recognized. Although several studies have investigated rice leaf rolling and identified some related genes, knowledge of the molecular mechanism underlying rice leaf rolling, especially outward leaf rolling, is limited. Therefore, in this study, differential proteomics and gene expression profiling were used to analyze rolled leaf mutant of transgenic rice in order to investigate differentially expressed genes and proteins related to rice leaf rolling. To this end, 28 differentially expressed proteins related to rolling leaf traits were isolated and identified. Digital expression profiling detected 10 genes related to rice leaf rolling. Some of the proteins and genes detected are involved in lipid metabolism, which is related to the development of bulliform cells, such as phosphoinositide phospholipase C, Mgll gene, and At4g26790 gene. The "omics"-level techniques were useful for simultaneously isolating several proteins and genes related to rice leaf rolling. In addition, the results of the analysis of differentially expressed proteins and genes were closely consistent with those from a corresponding functional analysis of cellular mechanisms; our study findings might form the basis for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying rice leaf rolling.
28812021	Association Analysis of Arsenic-Induced Straighthead in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) Based on the Selected Population with a Modified Model.	2017	Biomed Res Int	A rice physiological disorder makes mature panicle keep erect with empty grains termed as "straighthead." Straighthead causes yield losses and is a serious threat to rice production worldwide. Here, a new study of association mapping was conducted to identify QTL involved in straighthead. A subset of 380 accessions was selected from the USDA rice core collection and genotyped with 72 genome-wide SSR markers. An optimal model implemented with principle components (PCs) was used in this association mapping. As a result, five markers were identified to be significantly associated with straighthead. Three of them, RM263, RM169, and RM224, were consistent with a previous study. Three markers, RM475, RM263, and RM19, had a resistant allele associated with a decrease in straighthead rating (straighthead rating ≤ 4.8). In contrast, the two other marker loci RM169 and RM224 had a few susceptible alleles associated with an increase in straighthead rating (straighthead rating ≥ 8.7). Interestingly, RM475 is close to QTL "qSH-2" and "AsS" with straighthead resistance, which was reported in two studies on linkage mapping of straighthead. This finding adds to previous work and is useful for further genetic study of straighthead.
28717360	Ethanol Enhances High-Salinity Stress Tolerance by Detoxifying Reactive Oxygen Species in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	High-salinity stress considerably affects plant growth and crop yield. Thus, developing techniques to enhance high-salinity stress tolerance in plants is important. In this study, we revealed that ethanol enhances high-salinity stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the ethanol-induced tolerance, we performed microarray analyses using A. thaliana seedlings. Our data indicated that the expression levels of 1,323 and 1,293 genes were upregulated by ethanol in the presence and absence of NaCl, respectively. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling-related genes associated with high-salinity tolerance was upregulated by ethanol under salt stress condition. Some of these genes encode ROS scavengers and transcription factors (e.g., AtZAT10 and AtZAT12). A RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression levels of AtZAT10 and AtZAT12 as well as AtAPX1 and AtAPX2, which encode cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (APX), were higher in ethanol-treated plants than in untreated control plants, when exposure to high-salinity stress. Additionally, A. thaliana cytosolic APX activity increased by ethanol in response to salinity stress. Moreover, histochemical analyses with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) revealed that ROS accumulation was inhibited by ethanol under salt stress condition in A. thaliana and rice, in which DAB staining data was further confirmed by Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. These results suggest that ethanol enhances high-salinity stress tolerance by detoxifying ROS. Our findings may have implications for improving salt-stress tolerance of agriculturally important field-grown crops.
28687785	Seed Pelleting with Calcium Peroxide Improves Crop Establishment of Direct-seeded Rice under Waterlogging Conditions.	2017	Sci Rep	Poor crop establishment of direct-seeded rice (DSR) is one of the major constraints to wide adoption of DSR, particularly in areas prone to flooding after sowing or where fields are not level. Seed pelleting is an effective, practical and facile technique to enhance crop establishment under unfavorable environmental conditions. To evaluate the effects of seed pelleting on rice germination, seedling growth and associated metabolic events under waterlogging stress, various seed pelleting treatments including formulae, pelleting times (the weight ratio of pelleting agents: rice seeds = 1:1~7:1 (w/w) and CaO2 contents were tested in series of experiments. Naked seeds were maintained for comparison as a control. Pelleting treatments with CaO2 significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth of DSR under waterlogging conditions compared with pelleted seeds without CaO2 and naked seeds. The optimum weight ratios of CaO2 to dry seeds were found to be in the range of 0.6:1-1:1 based on seed germination and seedling growth performance under waterlogging conditions. Under waterlogging conditions, high seed germination percentage and vigorous seedling growth of DSR due to seed pelleting with CaO2 was associated with an increase in α-amylase activity, but decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activities in pelleted seeds.
28762322	Optimized Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolite Extraction and Analysis for the Geographical Discrimination of White Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.): A Method Comparison Study.	2017	J AOAC Int	In this study, we examined the effects of different extraction methods for the GC-MS- and LC-MS-based metabolite profiling of white rice (Oryza sativa L.). In addition, the metabolite divergence of white rice cultivated in either Korea or China was also evaluated. The discrimination analysis of each extraction method for white rice from Korea and China and the corresponding discriminatory markers were estimated by unpaired t-test, principal component analysis, k-means cluster analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and random forest (RF). According to the prediction parameters obtained from PLS-DA and RF classifiers as well as features that could be identified, the extraction method using 75% isopropanol heated at 100&#176;C coupled with LC-MS analysis was confirmed to be superior to the other extraction methods. Noticeably, lysophospholipid concentrations were significantly different in white rice between Korea and China, and they are novel markers for geographical discrimination. In conclusion, our study suggests an optimized extraction and analysis method as well as novel markers for the geographical discrimination of white rice.
28526728	Genetic Subtraction Profiling Identifies Candidate miRNAs Involved in Rice Female Gametophyte Abortion.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	The female gametophyte is an important participant in the sexual reproduction of plants. The molecular mechanism of its development has received much attention in recent years. As important regulators of gene expression, miRNAs have been certified to play a significant role in many biological processes of plants, including sexual reproduction. In this study, to investigate the potential regulatory effects of miRNAs on rice female gametophyte abortion, we used the high-throughput sequencing method to compare the miRNA transcriptome in ovules of a high frequency female-sterile line (fsv1) and a rice wild-type line (Gui 99) during ovule development. As a result, 522 known miRNAs and 295 novel miRNAs were expressed in the developing ovule of rice, while 100 known miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between these two rice lines during ovule development. Combining with gene expression information, a total of 627 coherent target genes of these differential expressed known miRNAs between fsv1 and Gui 99 were identified. The functional analyses of these coherent target genes revealed that the coherent target genes of differential expressed known miRNAs between the two rice lines are involved in many biological pathways, such as protein degradation, auxin signal transduction, and transcription factor regulation. These results provide us with important clues to investigate the regulatory roles of miRNAs in rice female gametophyte abortion.
28719243	Genotyping-by-Sequencing-Based Genetic Analysis of African Rice Cultivars and Association Mapping of Blast Resistance Genes Against Magnaporthe oryzae Populations in Africa.	2017	Phytopathology	Understanding the genetic diversity of rice germplasm is important for the sustainable use of genetic materials in rice breeding and production. Africa is rich in rice genetic resources that can be utilized to boost rice productivity on the continent. A major constraint to rice production in Africa is rice blast, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. In this report, we present the results of a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)-based diversity analysis of 190 African rice cultivars and an association mapping of blast resistance (R) genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The 190 African cultivars were clustered into three groups based on the 184K single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by GBS. We inoculated the rice cultivars with six African M. oryzae isolates. Association mapping identified 25 genomic regions associated with blast resistance (RABRs) in the rice genome. Moreover, PCR analysis indicated that RABR_23 is associated with the Pi-ta gene on chromosome 12. Our study demonstrates that the combination of GBS-based genetic diversity population analysis and association mapping is effective in identifying rice blast R genes/QTLs that contribute to resistance against African populations of M. oryzae. The identified markers linked to the RABRs and 14 highly resistant cultivars in this study will be useful for rice breeding in Africa.
28687802	Rice Flowering Locus T 1 plays an important role in heading date influencing yield traits in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Important role of flowering genes in enhancing grain productivity in rice has become well recognized for a number of key genes regulating the florigen production, but little has been known for the two florigen genes themselves. In this study, pleiotropism of Rice Flowering Locus T 1 (RFT1), one of the two florigen genes in rice, was firstly evaluated using near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying RFT1 alleles from the indica rice cultivars Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Milyang 46, respectively, and then determined by transformation of the RFT1 ZS97 allele into a japonica rice variety, Zhonghua 11. The RFT1 ZS97 allele was shown to delay heading and increase plant height, grain weight, grain number and grain yield, indicating that RFT1 plays an important role in the growth and development of rice. This study has also validated the potential of using a new type of genetic resource, sequential residual heterozygotes (SeqRHs), for QTL fine-mapping. A step-by-step approach was employed for SeqRHs identification, NIL development and QTL fine-mapping. The heterozygous segments and candidate QTL regions were gradually narrowed down. Eventually, the QTL region was delimited to a 1.7 kb region containing a single gene.
28753622	Combined influence of Bt rice and rice dwarf virus on biological parameters of a non-target herbivore, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae).	2017	PLoS One	The advent of genetically modified (GM) Bt rice creates the possibility of interactions among Bt crops, crop pathogens and non-target herbivores. In particular, information on how pathogen-infected Bt-expressing plants will influence non-target herbivores is necessary to predict the sustainability of GM cropping systems. Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the potential combined impacts of rice dwarf virus (RDV) and two Bt rice lines, T1C-19 (Cry1C) and T2A-1 (Cry2A), on non-target green rice leafhopper (GRLH), Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). In the first experiment, GRLHs feeding preference tests on Bt rice lines compared to a parental control rice line, MH63, were conducted. As rice plants were uninfected with RDV, GRLHs generally preferred the control MH63 line over the two Bt lines during the initial 8 h, with no significant preference during the following 64 h. As rice plants were infected with RDV, there were no clear preferences between the Bt rice lines and the control MH63 line. In the second experiment, we assessed the combined influence of RDV-infection status and Bt rice lines on GRLH biological parameters. Egg duration, adult weights, and male adult longevity were significantly affected on RDV-infected Bt rice. Other parameters, egg hatching rate, nymph survival and fecundity were not significantly influenced. We infer that interaction effect among two testing Bt rice lines and RDV will not lead to enlarged pest populations, thus demonstrating that growing these two Bt rice lines will poses negligible risk to GRLH in sustainable rice agroecosystems. Long-term field experiments to monitor the population dynamics of GRLHs at large scale need to be carried out to confirm the current results.
28746886	In vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of amylopectins from rice starches.	2017	Int J Biol Macromol	The effects of the molecular structures of amylopectins on the enzymatic hydrolysis of waxy-rice amylopectin (WRA) and normal-rice amylopectin (NRA) were investigated. The results indicated that compared to NRA, WRA possessed larger chain length, number of chains, internal chain length, degree of polymerisation, interblock chain length, and lower degree of branching and short:long B-chains, which caused WRA was much less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than NRA. The digestibility curves for WRA and NRA were well fitted by the first-order kinetic equation. WRA and NRA were hydrolyzed in two separates phases in the LOS plots. Whether using α-amylase alone, or together with amyloglucosidase, WRA and NRA exhibited different digestibility rates due to different chain structure of amylopectin. The low C1∞ values predicted that WRA and NRA would have little impact on blood glucose concentrations in the early digestion stage. HPLC results showed that G1∼G5 from WRA using α-amylase were lower than that from NRA, whereas from WRA were higher than that from NRA. There was the synergism between α-amylase and amyloglucosidase in glucose released from WRA and NRA.
28755293	Genome re-sequencing analysis uncovers pathogenecity-related genes undergoing positive selection in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Sci China Life Sci	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is one of the most destructive diseases, which causes significant rice yield losses and affects global food security. To better understand genetic variations among different isolates of M. oryzae in nature, we re-sequenced the genomes of two field isolates, CH43 and Zhong-10-8-14, which showed distinct pathogenecity on most of the rice cultivars. Genome-wide genetic variation analysis reveals that ZHONG-10-8-14 exhibits higher sequence variations than CH43. Structural variations (SVs) detection shows that the sequence variations primarily occur in exons and intergenic regions. Bioinformatics analysis for gene variations reveals that many pathogenecity-related pathways are enriched. In addition, 193 candidate effectors with various DNA polymorphisms were identified, including two known effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pita1. Comparative polymorphism analysis of thirteen randomly selected effectors suggests that the genetic variations of effectors are under positive selection. The expression pattern analysis of several pathogenecity-related variant genes indicates that these genes are differentially regulated in two isolates, with much higher expression levels in Zhong-10-8-14 than CH43. Our data demonstrate that the genetic variations of effectors and pathogenecity-related genes are under positive selection, resulting in the distinct pathogenicities of CH43 and Zhong-10-8-14 on rice.
28687080	Inhibition of RNA polymerase II allows controlled mobilisation of retrotransposons for plant breeding.	2017	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: Retrotransposons play a central role in plant evolution and could be a powerful endogenous source of genetic and epigenetic variability for crop breeding. To ensure genome integrity several silencing mechanisms have evolved to repress retrotransposon mobility. Even though retrotransposons fully depend on transcriptional activity of the host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) for their mobility, it was so far unclear whether Pol II is directly involved in repressing their activity.

RESULTS: Here we show that plants defective in Pol II activity lose DNA methylation at repeat sequences and produce more extrachromosomal retrotransposon DNA upon stress in Arabidopsis and rice. We demonstrate that combined inhibition of both DNA methylation and Pol II activity leads to a strong stress-dependent mobilization of the heat responsive ONSEN retrotransposon in Arabidopsis seedlings. The progenies of these treated plants contain up to 75 new ONSEN insertions in their genome which are stably inherited over three generations of selfing. Repeated application of heat stress in progeny plants containing increased numbers of ONSEN copies does not result in increased activation of this transposon compared to control lines. Progenies with additional ONSEN copies show a broad panel of environment-dependent phenotypic diversity.

CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Pol II acts at the root of transposon silencing. This is important because it suggests that Pol II can regulate the speed of plant evolution by fine-tuning the amplitude of transposon mobility. Our findings show that it is now possible to study induced transposon bursts in plants and unlock their use to induce epigenetic and genetic diversity for crop breeding.
28727805	Turgor-responsive starch phosphorylation in Oryza sativa stems: A primary event of starch degradation associated with grain-filling ability.	2017	PLoS One	Grain filling ability is mainly affected by the translocation of carbohydrates generated from temporarily stored stem starch in most field crops including rice (Oryza sativa L.). The partitioning of non-structural stem carbohydrates has been recognized as an important trait for raising the yield ceiling, yet we still do not fully understand how carbohydrate partitioning occurs in the stems. In this study, two rice subspecies that exhibit different patterns of non-structural stem carbohydrates partitioning, a japonica-dominant cultivar, Momiroman, and an indica-dominant cultivar, Hokuriku 193, were used as the model system to study the relationship between turgor pressure and metabolic regulation of non-structural stem carbohydrates, by combining the water status measurement with gene expression analysis and a dynamic prefixed 13C tracer analysis using a mass spectrometer. Here, we report a clear varietal difference in turgor-associated starch phosphorylation occurred at the initiation of non-structural carbohydrate partitioning. The data indicated that starch degradation in Hokuriku 193 stems occurred at full-heading, 5 days earlier than in Momiroman, contributing to greater sink filling. Gene expression analysis revealed that expression pattern of the gene encoding α-glucan, water dikinase (GWD1) was similar between two varieties, and the maximum expression level in Hokuriku 193, reached at full heading (4 DAH), was greater than in Momiroman, leading to an earlier increase in a series of amylase-related gene expression in Hokuriku 193. In both varieties, peaks in turgor pressure preceded the increases in GWD1 expression, and changes in GWD1 expression was correlated with turgor pressure. Additionally, a threshold is likely to exist for GWD1 expression to facilitate starch degradation. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that turgor-associated starch phosphorylation in cells is responsible for the metabolism that leads to starch degradation. Because the two cultivars exhibited remarkable varietal differences in the pattern of non-structural carbohydrate partitioning, our findings propose that the observed difference in grain-filling ability originated from turgor-associated regulation of starch phosphorylation in stem parenchyma cells. Further understanding of the molecular mechanism of turgor-regulation may provide a new selection criterion for breaking the yield barriers in crop production.
28761150	Single genetic locus improvement of iron, zinc and β-carotene content in rice grains.	2017	Sci Rep	Nearly half of the world's population obtains its daily calories from rice grains, which lack or have insufficient levels of essential micronutrients. The deficiency of micronutrients vital for normal growth is a global health problem, and iron, zinc and vitamin A deficiencies are the most prevalent ones. We developed rice lines expressing Arabidopsis NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 1 (AtNAS1), bean FERRITIN (PvFERRITIN), bacterial CAROTENE DESATURASE (CRTI) and maize PHYTOENE SYNTHASE (ZmPSY) in a single genetic locus in order to increase iron, zinc and β-carotene content in the rice endosperm. NAS catalyzes the synthesis of nicotianamine (NA), which is a precursor of deoxymugeneic acid (DMA) iron and zinc chelators, and also chelate iron and zinc for long distance transport. FERRITIN provides efficient storage of up to 4500 iron ions. PSY catalyzes the conversion of GGDP to phytoene, and CRTI performs the function of desaturases required for the synthesis of β-carotene from phytoene. All transgenic rice lines have significantly increased β-carotene, iron, and zinc content in the polished rice grains. Our results establish a proof-of-concept for multi-nutrient enrichment of rice grains from a single genetic locus, thus offering a sustainable and effective approach to address different micronutrient deficiencies at once.
28670755	Production of low-Cs<sup>+</sup> rice plants by inactivation of the K<sup>+</sup> transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system.	2017	Plant J	The occurrence of radiocesium in food has raised sharp health concerns after nuclear accidents. Despite being present at low concentrations in contaminated soils (below μm), cesium (Cs+ ) can be taken up by crops and transported to their edible parts. This plant capacity to take up Cs+ from low concentrations has notably affected the production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Japan after the nuclear accident at Fukushima in 2011. Several strategies have been put into practice to reduce Cs+ content in this crop species such as contaminated soil removal or adaptation of agricultural practices, including dedicated fertilizer management, with limited impact or pernicious side-effects. Conversely, the development of biotechnological approaches aimed at reducing Cs+ accumulation in rice remain challenging. Here, we show that inactivation of the Cs+ -permeable K+ transporter OsHAK1 with the CRISPR-Cas system dramatically reduced Cs+ uptake by rice plants. Cs+ uptake in rice roots and in transformed yeast cells that expressed OsHAK1 displayed very similar kinetics parameters. In rice, Cs+ uptake is dependent on two functional properties of OsHAK1: (i) a poor capacity of this system to discriminate between Cs+ and K+ ; and (ii) a high capacity to transport Cs+ from very low external concentrations that is likely to involve an active transport mechanism. In an experiment with a Fukushima soil highly contaminated with 137 Cs+ , plants lacking OsHAK1 function displayed strikingly reduced levels of 137 Cs+ in roots and shoots. These results open stimulating perspectives to smartly produce safe food in regions contaminated by nuclear accidents.
28677082	Mapping QTLs associated to germination stability following dry-heat treatment in rice seed.	2017	3 Biotech	Using 164 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Milyang 23 (indica/japonica) and Gihobyeo (japonica) in rice, dry-heat tolerance was evaluated for the seeds of parents and RILs, whose dormancy was naturally broken in six months after harvesting. Mapping QTLs associated to dry-heat tolerance was carried out through interval mapping using Qgene 3.0. Seed germination after dry-heat treatments (90 °C for 24 h) showed a significant difference between the two parents, when evaluated for percentage germination and mean germination time. Milyang 23 was highly tolerant to the dry-heat treatment, while Gihobyeo was sensitive. Three QTLs (qDHT 1, qDHT 5, and qDHT 7) conferring the dry-heat tolerance were mapped to chromosomes 1, 5 and 7, respectively. qDHT 1 on chromosome 1 was tightly linked at 4 cM from ME1-1. The phenotypic variation explained by the three QTLs was 27.18% of the total variance in the 164 RIL populations, and the parental additive effects of three QTLs affected the Milyang 23 allele increased dry-heat tolerance. The detection of new QTLs associated with dry-heat tolerance will provide important information for disease and insect control, using dry-heat treatment in organic or low input sustainable agriculture.
28729614	Knockdown of two Cadherin genes confers resistance to Cry2A and Cry1C in Chilo suppressalis.	2017	Sci Rep	Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins play an important role in the management of insect pests. Resistance to Bt toxins has been reported in many pest insects but the mechanism responsible for this resistance in rice crop pests remains largely unknown. Cadherin is one of several Bt toxin receptors. At present, only one cadherin gene, CsCAD1, has been documented in the striped rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. We amplified a nearly full-length transcript of another C. suppressalis cadherin gene, CsCAD2, and found that it has a different expression pattern to CsCAD1. CsCAD1 was highly expressed in fifth and sixth instar larvae, especially in the midgut, while the expression levels of CsCA2 were equably in each developmental stage. Newly hatched larvae were fed on rice smeared with synthesized siRNA to knockdown either CsCAD1 or CsCAD2, and then were fed transgenic rice expressing either the Cry2A or Cry1C toxins. The siRNA-treatment groups had lower mortality and higher survival rates than the control group, suggesting that reduced expression of CsCAD1 or CsCAD2 increased resistance to Cry2A and Cry1C. We conclude that CsCAD1 and CsCAD2 interact with Bt toxins in C. suppressalis and that this interaction could be the mechanism underlying Bt resistance in this insect.
28686687	Characterizing roots and water uptake in a ground cover rice production system.	2017	PLoS One	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Water-saving ground cover rice production systems (GCRPS) are gaining popularity in many parts of the world. We aimed to describe the characteristics of root growth, morphology, distribution, and water uptake for a GCRPS.

METHODS: A traditional paddy rice production system (TPRPS) was compared with GCRPS in greenhouse and field experiments. In the greenhouse, GCRPS where root zone average soil water content was kept near saturation (GCRPSsat), field capacity (GCRPSfwc) and 80% field capacity (GCRPS80%), were evaluated. In a two-year field experiment, GCRPSsat and GCRPS80% were applied.

RESULTS: Similar results were found in greenhouse and field experiments. Before mid-tillering the upper soil temperature was higher for GCRPS, leading to enhanced root dry weight, length, surface area, specific root length, and smaller diameter of roots but lower water uptake rate per root length compared to TPRPS. In subsequent growth stages, the reduced soil water content under GCRPS caused that the preponderance of root growth under GCRPSsat disappeared in comparison to TPRPS. Under other GCRPS treatments (GCRPSfwc and GCRPS80%), significant limitation on root growth, bigger root diameter and higher water uptake rate per root length were found.

CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies in soil water and temperature between TPRPS and GCRPS caused adjustments to root growth, morphology, distribution and function. Even though drought stress was inevitable after mid-tillering under GCRPS, especially GCRPS80%, similar or even enhanced root water uptake capacity in comparison to TPRPS might promote allocation of photosynthetic products to shoots and increase water productivity.
28678349	Construction of a multicontrol sterility system for a maize male-sterile line and hybrid seed production based on the ZmMs7 gene encoding a PHD-finger transcription factor.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Although hundreds of genetic male sterility (GMS) mutants have been identified in maize, few are commercially used due to a lack of effective methods to produce large quantities of pure male-sterile seeds. Here, we develop a multicontrol sterility (MCS) system based on the maize male sterility 7 (ms7) mutant and its wild-type Zea mays Male sterility 7 (ZmMs7) gene via a transgenic strategy, leading to the utilization of GMS in hybrid seed production. ZmMs7 is isolated by a map-based cloning approach and encodes a PHD-finger transcription factor orthologous to rice PTC1 and Arabidopsis MS1. The MCS transgenic maintainer lines are developed based on the ms7-6007 mutant transformed with MCS constructs containing the (i) ZmMs7 gene to restore fertility, (ii) α-amylase gene ZmAA and/or (iii) DNA adenine methylase gene Dam to devitalize transgenic pollen, (iv) red fluorescence protein gene DsRed2 or mCherry to mark transgenic seeds and (v) herbicide-resistant gene Bar for transgenic seed selection. Self-pollination of the MCS transgenic maintainer line produces transgenic red fluorescent seeds and nontransgenic normal colour seeds at a 1:1 ratio. Among them, all the fluorescent seeds are male fertile, but the seeds with a normal colour are male sterile. Cross-pollination of the transgenic plants to male-sterile plants propagates male-sterile seeds with high purity. Moreover, the transgene transmission rate through pollen of transgenic plants harbouring two pollen-disrupted genes is lower than that containing one pollen-disrupted gene. The MCS system has great potential to enhance the efficiency of maize male-sterile line propagation and commercial hybrid seed production.
28701756	Seed Metabolome Analysis of a Transgenic Rice Line Expressing Cholera Toxin B-subunit.	2017	Sci Rep	Plant-based human vaccines have been actively developed in recent years, and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the best candidate crops for their production and delivery. By expressing a modified cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, we previously developed MucoRice-CTB, a rice-based vaccine against cholera, which is caused by infection of the intestine with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. MucoRice-CTB lines have been extensively characterized by whole-genome sequencing and proteome analyses to evaluate the mutation profiles and proteome status, respectively. Here, we report non-targeted metabolomic profiling of the MucoRice-CTB transgenic rice line 51A (MR-CTB51A), MucoRice-RNAi (MR-RNAi), and their non-transgenic parent line by using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The levels of several amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and secondary metabolites were significantly increased in MR-CTB51A compared with the non-transgenic parent line. These metabolomics results complement essential information obtained by genome sequencing and proteomics approaches, thereby contributing to comprehensive understanding of the properties of MucoRice-CTB as a plant-based vaccine.
28680100	The Sulfoquinovosyltransferase-like Enzyme SQD2.2 is Involved in Flavonoid Glycosylation, Regulating Sugar Metabolism and Seed Setting in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Seed setting is an important trait that contributes to seed yield and relies greatly on starch accumulation. In this study, a sulfoquinovosyl transferase-like protein, designated as SQD2.2 involved in seed setting and flavonoid accumulation, was identified and characterized in rice. Rice SQD2.2 is localized to the cytoplasm, and the SQD2.2 transcript was highest in leaves. Rice SQD2.2-overexpressing (OE) plants exhibited a decreased seed setting rate and diminished tiller number simultaneously with an increased glycosidic flavonoid level compared with wild-type (WT) plants. SQD2.2 catalyzes the glycosylation of apigenin to produce apigenin 7-O-glucoside using uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) as a sugar donor, but it failed to compensate for sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) synthesis in the Arabidopsis sqd2 mutant. Furthermore, apigenin 7-O-glucoside inhibited starch synthase (SS) activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and SQD2.2-OE plants exhibited reduced SS activity accompanied by a significant reduction in starch levels and an elevation in soluble sugar levels relative to WT plants. Both adenosine diphosphate-glucose (ADPG) and UDPG levels in SQD2.2-OE plants were notably lower than those in WT plants. Taken together, rice SQD2.2 exhibits a novel role in flavonoid synthesis and plays an important role in mediating sugar allocation between primary and secondary metabolism in rice.
28710280	The assembly of the plant urease activation complex and the essential role of the urease accessory protein G (UreG) in delivery of nickel to urease.	2017	J Biol Chem	Urease is a ubiquitous nickel metalloenzyme. In plants, its activation requires three urease accessory proteins (UAPs), UreD, UreF, and UreG. In bacteria, the UAPs interact with urease and facilitate activation, which involves the channeling of two nickel ions into the active site. So far this process has not been investigated in eukaryotes. Using affinity pulldowns of Strep-tagged UAPs from Arabidopsis and rice transiently expressed in planta, we demonstrate that a urease-UreD-UreF-UreG complex exists in plants and show its stepwise assembly. UreG is crucial for nickel delivery because UreG-dependent urease activation in vitro was observed only with UreG obtained from nickel-sufficient plants. This activation competence could not be generated in vitro by incubation of UreG with nickel, bicarbonate, and GTP. Compared with their bacterial orthologs, plant UreGs possess an N-terminal extension containing a His- and Asp/Glu-rich hypervariable region followed by a highly conserved sequence comprising two potential HXH metal-binding sites. Complementing the ureG-1 mutant of Arabidopsis with N-terminal deletion variants of UreG demonstrated that the hypervariable region has a minor impact on activation efficiency, whereas the conserved region up to the first HXH motif is highly beneficial and up to the second HXH motif strictly required for activation. We also show that urease reaches its full activity several days after nickel becomes available in the leaves, indicating that urease activation is limited by nickel accessibility in vivo Our data uncover the crucial role of UreG for nickel delivery during eukaryotic urease activation, inciting further investigations of the details of this process.
28710485	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.	2017	Sci Rep	Previous studies suggested that Hd1 promoted heading under short-day conditions (SD) and delayed heading under long-day conditions (LD). However in this study, Hd1 was demonstrated to consistently promote heading date in Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) background by upregulating Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 expression under both SD and LD. While the high photoperiod sensitivity of Hd1 was observed in Minghui 63 (MH63) background, with heading being suppressed in LD but promoted in SD. Comparative analysis of two sets of near isogenic lines of Hd1 in MH63 and ZS97 backgrounds indicated that the alternative functions of Hd1 in promoting or suppressing heading under LD are dependent on the previously cloned flowering repressor gene Ghd7. The interaction between proteins Ghd7 and Hd1 occurred through binding of the CCT domain of Ghd7 to the transcription-activating domain of Hd1, resulting in suppression of Ehd1 and florigen gene expression. The involvement of the transcription-activating domain of Hd1 in this protein-protein interaction probably blocked or weakened its transcriptional activity. These findings suggest that Hd1 alone essentially acts as a promoter of heading date, and the protein interaction between Ghd7 and Hd1 determines photoperiod sensitivity and integrated Hd1-mediated and Ehd1-mediated flowering pathways in rice.
28738551	Biomass saccharification is largely enhanced by altering wall polymer features and reducing silicon accumulation in rice cultivars harvested from nitrogen fertilizer supply.	2017	Bioresour Technol	In this study, two rice cultivars were collected from experimental fields with seven nitrogen fertilizer treatments. All biomass samples contained significantly increased cellulose contents and reduced silica levels, with variable amounts of hemicellulose and lignin from different nitrogen treatments. Under chemical (NaOH, CaO, H2SO4) and physical (hot water) pretreatments, biomass samples exhibited much enhanced hexoses yields from enzymatic hydrolysis, with high bioethanol production from yeast fermentation. Notably, both degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose and xylose/arabinose (Xyl/Ara) ratio of hemicellulose were reduced in biomass residues, whereas other wall polymer features (cellulose crystallinity and monolignol proportion) were variable. Integrative analysis indicated that cellulose DP, hemicellulosic Xyl/Ara and silica are the major factors that significantly affect cellulose crystallinity and biomass saccharification. Hence, this study has demonstrated that nitrogen fertilizer supply could largely enhance biomass saccharification in rice cultivars, mainly by reducing cellulose DP, hemicellulosic Xyl/Ara and silica in cell walls.
28818376	An overview on the strategies to exploit rice endosperm as production platform for biopharmaceuticals.	2017	Plant Sci	Cereal seed has been utilized as production platform for high-value biopharmaceutical proteins. Especially, protein bodies (PBs) in seeds are not only natural specialized storage organs of seed storage proteins (SSPs), but also suitable intracellular deposition compartment for recombinant proteins. When various recombinant proteins were produced as secretory proteins by attaching N terminal ER signal peptide and C terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal or as fusion proteins with SSPs, high amounts of recombinant proteins can be predominantly accumulated in the PBs. Recombinant proteins bioencapsulated in PBs exhibit high resistance to digestive enzymes in gastrointestinal tract than other intracellular compartments and are highly stable at ambient temperature, thus allowing oral administration of PBs containing recombinant proteins as oral drugs or functional nutrients in cost-effective minimum processed formulation. In this review, we would like to address key factors determining accumulation levels of recombinant proteins in PBs. Understanding of bottle neck parts and improvement of specific deposition to PBs result in much higher levels of production of high quality recombinant proteins.
28870292	Nutrients and host attributes modulate the abundance and functional traits of phyllosphere microbiome in rice.	2017	Microbiol Res	The abundance of phyllosphere bacterial communities of seven genotypes of rice ADT- 38, ADT-43, CR-1009, PB-1, PS-5, P-44, and PB-1509 was investigated, in relation to nutrient dynamics of rhizosphere and leaves. P-44 genotype recorded highest pigment accumulation, while genotypes CR-1009 and P-44 exhibited most number of different bacterial morphotypes, Colony forming units in two media (Nutrient agar and R2A) varied significantly and ranged from 106-107 per g plant tissues. Among the selected 60 distinct morphotypes, IAA and siderophore producers were the dominant functional types. Biocontrol activity against Drechslera oryzae was shown by 38 isolates, while 17 and 9 isolates were potent against Rhizoctonia solani and Magnaporthe oryzae respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) illustrated the significant effects of selected soil and leaf nutrients of seven rice varieties on the culturable phyllospheric population (log CFU), particularly in the R2A medium. Eigen values revealed that 83% of the variance observed could be assigned to Leaf-Fe, Leaf-Mn, chlorophyll b and soil organic carbon (OC). Quantitative PCR analyses of abundance of bacteria, cyanobacteria and archaebacteria revealed a host-specific response, with CR-1009 showing highest number of 16S rRNA copies of bacterial members, while both P-44 and PS-5 had higher cyanobacterial abundance, but lowest number of those belonging to archaebacteria. Nutritional aspects of leaf and soil influenced the abundance of bacteria and their functional attributes; this is of interest for enhancing the efficacy of foliar inoculants, thereby, improving plant growth and disease tolerance.
28733852	Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf 4, encoding a β-ketoacyl-coenzyme A synthase 6, is involved in rice cuticular wax accumulation.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: WSL4 encodes a KCS6 protein which is required for cuticular wax accumulation in rice. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are essential precursors for cuticular wax biosynthesis. VLCFA biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex. The β-ketoacyl-coenzyme A synthase (KCS) catalyzes the first step of FAE-mediated VLCFA elongation. Here we characterized the Wax Crystal-Sparse Leaf 4 (WSL4) gene involved in leaf cuticular wax accumulation in rice. The wsl4 mutant displayed a pleiotropic phenotype including dwarfism, less tiller numbers and reduced surface wax load. Map-based cloning and nucleotide sequencing results revealed that wsl4 carried a single nucleotide substitution in the second exon of a putative KCS6 gene, encoding one subunit of the FAE complex for VLCFAs. Genetic complementation confirmed that the mutation in WSL4 was responsible for the phenotype of wsl4. WSL4 was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues and localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both WSL4-RNAi transgenic lines and WSL4 knocked-out mutants exhibited wax-deficient phenotypes similar to the wsl4 mutant. These data indicate that WSL4 is required for cuticular wax accumulation in rice.
28686018	Detection of G-Quadruplex Structures Formed by G-Rich Sequences from Rice Genome and Transcriptome Using Combined Probes.	2017	Anal Chem	Putative G-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences (PQS) are highly prevalent in the genome and transcriptome of various organisms and are considered as potential regulation elements in many biological processes by forming G4 structures. The formation of G4 structures highly depends on the sequences and the environment. In most cases, it is difficult to predict G4 formation by PQS, especially PQS containing G2 tracts. Therefore, the experimental identification of G4 formation is essential in the study of G4-related biological functions. Herein, we report a rapid and simple method for the detection of G4 structures by using a pair of complementary reporters, hemin and BMSP. This method was applied to detect G4 structures formed by PQS (DNA and RNA) searched in the genome and transcriptome of Oryza sativa. Unlike most of the reported G4 probes that only recognize part of G4 structures, the proposed method based on combined probes positively responded to almost all G4 conformations, including parallel, antiparallel, and mixed/hybrid G4, but did not respond to non-G4 sequences. This method shows potential for high-throughput identification of G4 structures in genome and transcriptome. Furthermore, BMSP was observed to drive some PQS to form more stable G4 structures or induce the G4 formation of some PQS that cannot form G4 in normal physiological conditions, which may provide a powerful molecular tool for gene regulation.
28682500	Direct and tunable modulation of protein levels in rice and wheat with a synthetic small molecule.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Direct control of protein level enables rapid and efficient analyses of gene functions in crops. Previously, we developed the RDDK-Shield1 (Shld1) system in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana for direct modulation of protein stabilization using a synthetic small molecule. However, it was unclear whether this system is applicable to economically important crops. In this study, we show that the RDDK-Shld1 system enables rapid and tunable control of protein levels in rice and wheat. Accumulation of RDDK fusion proteins can be reversibly and spatio-temporally controlled by the synthetic small-molecule Shld1. Moreover, RDDK-Bar and RDDK-Pid3 fusions confer herbicide and rice blast resistance, respectively, in a Shld1-dependent manner. Therefore, the RDDK-Shld1 system provides a reversible and tunable technique for controlling protein functions and conditional expression of transgenes in crops.
28744302	Nitrogen Fertilizer Deep Placement for Increased Grain Yield and Nitrogen Recovery Efficiency in Rice Grown in Subtropical China.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Field plot experiments were conducted over 3 years (from April 2014 to November 2016) in a double-rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping system in subtropical China to evaluate the effects of N fertilizer placement on grain yield and N recovery efficiency (NRE). Different N application methods included: no N application (CK); N broadcast application (NBP); N and NPK deep placement (NDP and NPKDP, respectively). Results showed that grain yield and apparent NRE significantly increased for NDP and NPKDP as compared to NBP. The main reason was that N deep placement (NDP) increased the number of productive panicle per m-2. To further evaluate the increase, a pot experiment was conducted to understand the N supply in different soil layers in NDP during the whole rice growing stage and a 15N tracing technique was used in a field experiment to investigate the fate of urea-15N in the rice-soil system during rice growth and at maturity. The pot experiment indicated that NDP could maintain a higher N supply in deep soil layers than N broadcast for 52 days during rice growth. The 15N tracing study showed that NDP could maintain much higher fertilizer N in the 5-20 cm soil layer during rice growth and could induce plant to absorb more N from fertilizer and soil than NBP, which led to higher NRE. One important finding was that NDP and NPKDP significantly increased fertilizer NRE but did not lead to N declined in soil compared to NBP. Compared to NPK, NPKDP induced rice plants to absorb more fertilizer N rather than soil N.
28740253	Effects of Transgenic Rice Infected with SRBSDV on Bt expression and the Ecological Fitness of Non-vector Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2017	Sci Rep	The susceptibility of rice lines, T1C-19, T2A-1, and MH63 to SRBSDV infection are similar and the contents of cry protein in T2A-1 and T1C-19 do not change significantly. The survival rates of BPH nymphs feeding on SRBSDV-infected T1C-19, Bt T2A-1, or MH63 rice plants were not significantly different. The developmental stages of female BPH fed on T1C-19 plants infected with SRBSDV were significantly shorter than those fed on uninfected rice, while the males showed no significant difference. The duration of BPH feeding on SRBSDV-infected T2A-1 and MH63 also showed no significant difference in comparison with the respective control groups. Longevities of BPH adults feeding on SRBSDV-infected T1C-19, T2A-1 or MH63 were also not significant. However, the longevity of male adult BPH feeding on un-infected MH63 was significantly reduced in comparison with that of adult males feeding on un-infected T1C-19 and T2A-1 rice. In addition, the different rice lines and the rice plants infected and uninfected with SRBSDV did not significantly affect the sex ratio, female body weight, longevity, fecundity, or egg hatchability of BPH. In general, transgenic Bt rice infected with SRBSDV had little effect on the ecological adaptability of BPH.
28747923	Mapping QTL for Seed Germinability under Low Temperature Using a New High-Density Genetic Map of Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Mapping major quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for rice seed germinability under low temperature (GULT) can provide valuable genetic source for improving cold tolerance in rice breeding. In this study, 124 rice backcross recombinant inbred lines (BRILs) derived from a cross indica cv. Changhui 891 and japonica cv. 02428 were genotyped through re-sequencing technology. A bin map was generated which includes 3057 bins covering distance of 1266.5 cM with an average of 0.41 cM between markers. On the basis of newly constructed high-density genetic map, six QTL were detected ranging from 40 to 140 kb on Nipponbare genome. Among these, two QTL qCGR8 and qGRR11 alleles shared by 02428 could increase GULT and seed germination recovery rate after cold stress, respectively. However, qNGR1 and qNGR4 may be two major QTL affecting indica Changhui 891germination under normal condition. QTL qGRR1 and qGRR8 affected the seed germination recovery rate after cold stress and the alleles with increasing effects were shared by the Changhui 891 could improve seed germination rate after cold stress dramatically. These QTL could be a highly valuable genetic factors for cold tolerance improvement in rice lines. Moreover, the BRILs developed in this study will serve as an appropriate choice for mapping and studying genetic basis of rice complex traits.
28818380	Molecular cloning and expression analysis of duplicated polyphenol oxidase genes reveal their functional differentiations in sorghum.	2017	Plant Sci	Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is believed to play a role in plant growth, reproduction, and resistance to pathogens and pests. PPO causes browning of grains in cereals. In this study, genetic mapping of sorghum grain for phenol color reaction (PHR) was performed using a recombinant inbred line population. Only one locus was detected between SSR markers SM06072 and Xtxp176 on chromosome 6. Two linked orthologous genes (Sb06PPO1 and Sb06PPO2) within the mapped region were discovered and cloned. Transformation experiments using Nipponbare (a PHR negative rice cultivar) showed that Sb06PPO1 from LTR108 and two Sb06PPO2 alleles from both varieties could complement Nipponbare, whereas Sb06PPO1 from 654 could not. Subsequent quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments showed that Sb06PPO1 and Sb06PPO2 functioned diversely, Sb06PPO1 was mainly expressed in young panicles before flowering. Sb06PPO2 was strongly expressed in flowering panicles, especially in hulls and branches at filling stage. Moreover, the expression of Sb06PPO1 was found to be significantly up-regulated by exogenous ABA and salt, whereas Sb06PPO2 was not changed significantly, further demonstrating functional differentiation between the two genes.
28754953	Genetically engineered rice endogenous 5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (epsps) transgene alters phenology and fitness of crop-wild hybrid offspring.	2017	Sci Rep	Genetically engineered (GE) rice endogenous epsps (5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene overexpressing EPSPS can increase glyphosate herbicide-resistance of cultivated rice. This type of epsps transgene can enhance the fecundity of rice crop-weed hybrid offspring in the absence of glyphosate, stimulating great concerns over undesired environmental impacts of transgene flow to populations of wild relatives. Here, we report the substantial alteration of phenology and fitness traits in F1-F3 crop-wild hybrid descendants derived from crosses between an epsps GE rice line and two endangered wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) populations, based on the common-garden field experiments. Under the glyphosate-free condition, transgenic hybrid lineages showed significantly earlier tillering and flowering, as well as increased fecundity and overwintering survival/regeneration abilities. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between the contents of endogenous EPSPS of wild, weedy, and cultivated rice parents and fitness differences caused by the incorporation of the epsps transgene. Namely, a lower level of endogenous EPSPS in the transgene-recipient populations displayed a more pronounced enhancement in fitness. The altered phenology and enhanced fitness of crop-wild hybrid offspring by the epsps transgene may cause unwanted environmental consequences when this type of glyphosate-resistance transgene introgressed into wild rice populations through gene flow.
28838125	HOTHEAD-Like HTH1 is Involved in Anther Cutin Biosynthesis and is Required for Pollen Fertility in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	The cuticle covering the outer surface of anthers is essential for male reproductive development in plants. However, the mechanism underlying the synthesis of these lipidic polymers remains unclear. HOTHEAD (HTH) in Arabidopsis thaliana is a presumptive glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain α-,ω-dicarboxylic fatty acids. In this study, we characterized the function of an anther-specific gene HTH1 in rice. HTH1 contains a conserved GMC oxidoreductase-like domain, and the sequence of HTH1 was highly similar to that of HTH in A. thaliana. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization analyses showed that HTH1 was highly expressed in epidermal cells of anthers. Rice plants with HTH1 suppression through CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and RNA interference (RNAi) displayed defective anther wall and aborted pollen. Disorganized cuticle layers in anthers and shriveled pollen grains were observed in HTH1-RNAi lines. The total amounts of long-chain fatty acids and cutin monomers in anthers of HTH1-RNAi lines were significantly reduced compared with the wild type. Our results suggested that HTH1 is involved in cutin biosynthesis and is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice.
28743949	The Rice Phytochrome Genes, PHYA and PHYB, Have Synergistic Effects on Anther Development and Pollen Viability.	2017	Sci Rep	Phytochromes are the main plant photoreceptors regulating multiple developmental processes. However, the regulatory network of phytochrome-mediated plant reproduction has remained largely unexplored. There are three phytochromes in rice, phyA, phyB and phyC. No changes in fertility are observed in the single mutants, whereas the seed-setting rate of the phyA phyB double mutant is significantly reduced. Histological and cytological analyses showed that the reduced fertility of the phyA phyB mutant was due to defects in both anther and pollen development. The four anther lobes in the phyA phyB mutant were developed at different stages with fewer pollen grains, most of which were aborted. At the mature stage, more than one lobe in the double mutant was just consisted of several cell layers. To identify genes involved in phytochrome-mediated anther development, anther transcriptomes of phyA, phyB and phyA phyB mutants were compared to that of wild-type rice respectively. Analysis of 2,241 double-mutant-specific differentially expressed transcripts revealed that the metabolic profiles, especially carbohydrate metabolism, were altered greatly, and heat-shock responses were activated in the double mutant. This study firstly provides valuable insight into the complex regulatory networks underlying phytochrome-mediated anther and pollen development in plants, and offers novel clues for hybrid rice breeding.
28680066	Effects of long-term cultivation of transgenic Bt rice (Kefeng-6) on soil microbial functioning and C cycling.	2017	Sci Rep	Understanding how soil ecosystem responds to transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice is necessary for environmental risk assessment. While the influences of short-term cultivation of Bt rice on soil properties have been reported previously, little is known about the long-term effects of Bt rice on soil ecosystems. In this study, soil samples were taken from a long-term rice cultivation site in Fujian Province, China, where transgenic Bt rice (Kefeng-6) and its non-Bt parent breed (Minghui-86) had been continuously cultivated for 8 years. Soil Bt protein concentration and a total of 16 variables were analyzed to assess potential risks of soil health under Bt rice cultivation. The results revealed that soil Bt protein is unlikely to accumulate after Bt rice cultivated in the field, and no consistently significant changes were observed in soil enzymatic activities (catalase, dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and urease), microbial biomass (microbial carbon and nitrogen), total organic carbon, decomposition (soil respiration, Q 10, and qCO2), soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Due to a local tradition that aboveground biomass was removed after harvest, the increased net primary productivity by Bt rice cultivation did not significantly change soil C cycling. Results of this study suggested that on the aspects of soil microbial functioning and C cycling, long-term cultivation of Bt rice is unlikely to result in significant effects on soil health.
28683715	Plant-RRBS, a bisulfite and next-generation sequencing-based methylome profiling method enriching for coverage of cytosine positions.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cytosine methylation in plant genomes is important for the regulation of gene transcription and transposon activity. Genome-wide methylomes are studied upon mutation of the DNA methyltransferases, adaptation to environmental stresses or during development. However, from basic biology to breeding programs, there is a need to monitor multiple samples to determine transgenerational methylation inheritance or differential cytosine methylation. Methylome data obtained by sodium hydrogen sulfite (bisulfite)-conversion and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provide genome-wide information on cytosine methylation. However, a profiling method that detects cytosine methylation state dispersed over the genome would allow high-throughput analysis of multiple plant samples with distinct epigenetic signatures. We use specific restriction endonucleases to enrich for cytosine coverage in a bisulfite and NGS-based profiling method, which was compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of the same plant material.

METHODS: We established an effective methylome profiling method in plants, termed plant-reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (plant-RRBS), using optimized double restriction endonuclease digestion, fragment end repair, adapter ligation, followed by bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and NGS. We report a performant laboratory protocol and a straightforward bioinformatics data analysis pipeline for plant-RRBS, applicable for any reference-sequenced plant species.

RESULTS: As a proof of concept, methylome profiling was performed using an Oryza sativa ssp. indica pure breeding line and a derived epigenetically altered line (epiline). Plant-RRBS detects methylation levels at tens of millions of cytosine positions deduced from bisulfite conversion in multiple samples. To evaluate the method, the coverage of cytosine positions, the intra-line similarity and the differential cytosine methylation levels between the pure breeding line and the epiline were determined. Plant-RRBS reproducibly covers commonly up to one fourth of the cytosine positions in the rice genome when using MspI-DpnII within a group of five biological replicates of a line. The method predominantly detects cytosine methylation in putative promoter regions and not-annotated regions in rice.

CONCLUSIONS: Plant-RRBS offers high-throughput and broad, genome-dispersed methylation detection by effective read number generation obtained from reproducibly covered genome fractions using optimized endonuclease combinations, facilitating comparative analyses of multi-sample studies for cytosine methylation and transgenerational stability in experimental material and plant breeding populations.
28621888	WIDE AND THICK GRAIN 1, which encodes an otubain-like protease with deubiquitination activity, influences grain size and shape in rice.	2017	Plant J	Grain size and shape are two crucial traits that influence grain yield and grain appearance in rice. Although several factors that affect grain size have been described in rice, the molecular mechanisms underlying the determination of grain size and shape are still elusive. In this study we report that WIDE AND THICK GRAIN 1 (WTG1) functions as an important factor determining grain size and shape in rice. The wtg1-1 mutant exhibits wide, thick, short and heavy grains and also shows an increased number of grains per panicle. WTG1 determines grain size and shape mainly by influencing cell expansion. WTG1 encodes an otubain-like protease, which shares similarity with human OTUB1. Biochemical analyses indicate that WTG1 is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, and the mutant protein (wtg1-1) loses this deubiquitinating activity. WTG1 is expressed in developing grains and panicles, and the GFP-WTG1 fusion protein is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of WTG1 results in narrow, thin, long grains due to narrow and long cells, further supporting the role of WTG1 in determining grain size and shape. Thus, our findings identify the otubain-like protease WTG1 to be an important factor that determines grain size and shape, suggesting that WTG1 has the potential to improve grain size and shape in rice.
28678533	A method for screening copper-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars based on hydroponic experiments and cluster analysis.	2017	Int J Phytoremediation	A method for screening copper (Cu)-tolerant rice cultivars was studied by combining hydroponic experiments and cluster analysis, and the classification of cultivars in Cu stress tolerance was done. In the first hydroponic experiment, seedlings of Jiahe991 and Xiushui114 were planted in nutrient solution with different Cu2+ concentrations from 10 to 1800 μg/L. Results indicated that the toxic threshold of Cu concentration in solution ranged from 900 to 1200 μg/L, since SPAD (Soil and Plant Analyzer Development, SPAD-502, a portable chlorophyll meter, Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., Japan) values of leaves and seedlings biomass of the treatments with ≥900 and/or 1200 µg/L were significantly lower than the control. The second experiment was conducted with 16 local rice cultivars under three Cu treatments (10, 1000, and 1500 μg/L). The 16 cultivars were well classified into tolerant, normal, and sensitive groups as a result of cluster analysis based on the relative SPAD (Soil and Plant Analyzer Development, SPAD-502, a portable chlorophyll meter, Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., Japan) value, shoot and root dry weights, root length and root dehydrogenase activity, and oxidizing capacity and shoot Cu concentration. Xiushui123, Xiushui134, Jiahe991, and Xianghu301 belonged to the tolerant group; Xiushui137 belonged to the sensitive group. The cluster analysis based on hydroponic experiments is an effective method for identifying rice cultivars that are tolerant to Cu stress. In addition, four cultivars (Xiushui123, Xiushui134, Jiahe991, and Xianghu301) are recommended in local practice.
28710696	Mesocotyl Elongation is Essential for Seedling Emergence Under Deep-Seeding Condition in Rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Direct-seeding cultivation by deep-seeding of seeds (drill seeding) is becoming popular due to the scarcity of land and labor. However, poor emergence and inadequate seedling establishment can lead to yield loss in direct-seeding cultivation by deep-sowing. In rice, mesocotyl and coleoptile are primarily responsible for seedling emergence from deeper levels of soil.

RESULTS: Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mesocotyl and coleoptile length at 5-cm seeding depth were detected using 98 backcross inbred lines from a cross between Kasalath and Nipponbare. Three QTLs qMel-1, qMel-3, and qMel-6 for mesocotyl length were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, and 6, respectively, in two independent replicates. At two QTLs, qMel-1 and qMel-3, the Kasalath alleles increased mesocotyl length, whereas Nipponbare allele increased at qMel-6. The Nipponbare alleles at two QTLs (qCol-3 and qCol-5) increased the coleoptile length. Further, seeds of 54 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) from the cross between Kasalath and Nipponbare sown at 5 cm soil depth showed a significant positive correlation between seedling emergence and mesocotyl elongation (r > 0.6, P < 0.0001), but not with coleoptile elongation (r = 0.05, P = 0.7). Seedling emergence of Nipponbare, Kasalath, and the 3 of the 54 CSSLs rapidly decreased with increasing sowing depth. Seedling emergence at seeding depths of 7 and 10 cm was faster in Kasalath and CSSL-5 that harbored the Kasalath alleles across the qMel-1 and qMel-3 regions than in the other two CSSLs that contained a single QTL and Nipponbare alleles. CSSL-5 showed the longest mesocotyl among the 3 CSSLs, but no difference in coleoptile length was observed among the 3 CSSLs at seeding depths of 7 and 10 cm.

CONCLUSION: Variation of mesocotyl elongation was found to be associated with seedling emergence at the seeding depth of 5 cm. To our knowledge, this is the first study performed using CSSLs to detect QTLs for mesocotyl or coleoptile elongation and to determine the effect of mesocotyl elongation on seedling emergence in rice. Our findings provides a foundation for developing rice cultivars that show higher seedling emergence after direct seeding by introgressing QTLs for mesocotyl elongation in rice breeding.
28674938	Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans, a mild pathogen impairs growth of rice by augmenting ethylene levels.	2017	Plant Mol Biol	KEY MESSAGE: Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans decreases growth of rice. Inoculation of rice with H. rubrisubalbicans increased the ACCO mRNA levels and ethylene production. The H. rubrisubalbicans rice interactions were further characterized by proteomic approach. Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans is a well-known growth-promoting rhizobacteria that can also act as a mild phyto-pathogen. During colonisation of rice, RT-qPCR analyses showed that H. rubrisubalbicans up-regulates the methionine recycling pathway as well as phyto-siderophore synthesis genes. mRNA levels of ACC oxidase and ethylene levels also increased in rice roots but inoculation with H. rubrisubalbicans impaired growth of the rice plant. A proteomic approach was used to identify proteins specifically modulated by H. rubrisubalbicans in rice and amongst the differentially expressed proteins a V-ATPase and a 14-3-3 protein were down-regulated. Several proteins of H. rubrisubalbicans were identified, including the type VI secretion system effector Hcp1, suggesting that protein secretion play a role colonisation in rice. Finally, the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, a primary scavenger of endogenous hydrogen peroxide was also identified. Monitoring the levels of reactive oxygen species in the epiphytic bacteria by flow cytometry revealed that H. rubrisubalbicans is subjected to oxidative stress, suggesting that the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase is an important regulator of redox homeostasis in plant-bacteria interactions.
28730412	GNS4, a novel allele of DWARF11, regulates grain number and grain size in a high-yield rice variety.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice plays an extremely important role in food safety because it feeds more than half of the world's population. Rice grain yield depends on biomass and the harvest index. An important strategy to break through the rice grain yield ceiling is to increase the biological yield. Therefore, genes associated with organ size are important targets for rice breeding.

RESULTS: We characterized a rice mutant gns4 (grain number and size on chromosome 4) with reduced organ size, fewer grains per panicle, and smaller grains compared with those of WT. Map-based cloning indicated that the GNS4 gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 protein, is a novel allele of DWARF11 (D11). A single nucleotide polymorphism (deletion) in the promoter region of GNS4 reduced its expression level in the mutant, leading to reduced grain number and smaller grains. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that GNS4 positively regulates grain size by promoting cell elongation. Overexpression of GNS4 significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds. These results suggest that GNS4 is key target gene with possible applications in rice yield breeding.

CONCLUSION: GNS4 was identified as a positive regulator of grain number and grain size in rice. Increasing the expression level of this gene in a high-yielding rice variety enhanced grain yield. GNS4 can be targeted in breeding programs to increase yields.
28798764	Root Transcriptomic Analysis Revealing the Importance of Energy Metabolism to the Development of Deep Roots in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Drought is the most serious abiotic stress limiting rice production, and deep root is the key contributor to drought avoidance. However, the genetic mechanism regulating the development of deep roots is largely unknown. In this study, the transcriptomes of 74 root samples from 37 rice varieties, representing the extreme genotypes of shallow or deep rooting, were surveyed by RNA-seq. The 13,242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between deep rooting and shallow rooting varieties (H vs. L) were enriched in the pathway of genetic information processing and metabolism, while the 1,052 DEGs between the deep roots and shallow roots from each of the plants (D vs. S) were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways especially energy metabolism. Ten quantitative trait transcripts (QTTs) were identified and some were involved in energy metabolism. Forty-nine candidate DEGs were confirmed by qRT-PCR and microarray. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found 18 hub genes. Surprisingly, all these hub genes expressed higher in deep roots than in shallow roots, furthermore half of them functioned in energy metabolism. We also estimated that the ATP production in the deep roots was faster than shallow roots. Our results provided a lot of reliable candidate genes to improve deep rooting, and firstly highlight the importance of energy metabolism to the development of deep roots.
28791031	Accurate Digitization of the Chlorophyll Distribution of Individual Rice Leaves Using Hyperspectral Imaging and an Integrated Image Analysis Pipeline.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Pigments absorb light, transform it into energy, and provide reaction sites for photosynthesis; thus, the quantification of pigment distribution is vital to plant research. Traditional methods for the quantification of pigments are time-consuming and not suitable for the high-throughput digitization of rice pigment distribution. In this study, using a hyperspectral imaging system, we developed an integrated image analysis pipeline for automatically processing enormous amounts of hyperspectral data. We also built models for accurately quantifying 4 pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid) from rice leaves and determined the important bands (700-760 nm) associated with these pigments. At the tillering stage, the R2 values and mean absolute percentage errors of the models were 0.827-0.928 and 6.94-12.84%, respectively. The hyperspectral data and these models can be combined for digitizing the distribution of the chlorophyll with high resolution (0.11 mm/pixel). In summary, the integrated hyperspectral image analysis pipeline and selected models can be used to quantify the chlorophyll distribution in rice leaves. The use of this technique will benefit rice functional genomics and rice breeding.

28680158	Higher Fertilizer Inputs Increase Fitness Traits of Brown Planthopper in Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the primary staple food source for more than half of the world's population. In many developing countries, increased use of fertilizers is a response to increase demand for rice. In this study, we investigated the effects of three principal fertilizer components (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) on the development of potted rice plants and their effects on fitness traits of the brown planthopper (BPH) [Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Homoptera: Delphacidae)], which is a major pest of rice in Bangladesh and elsewhere. Compared to low fertilizer inputs, high fertilizer treatments induced plant growth but also favored BPH development. The BPH had higher survival, developed faster, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r m ) was higher on well-fertilized than under-fertilized plants. Among the fertilizer inputs, nitrogen had the strongest effect on the fitness traits of BPH. Furthermore, both the "Plant vigor hypothesis" and the "Plant stress hypothesis" were supported by the results, the former hypothesis more so than the latter. These hypotheses suggest that the most suitable/attractive hosts for insect herbivores are the most vigorous plants. Our findings emphasized that an exclusive focus on yield increases through only enhanced crop fertilization may have unforeseen, indirect, effects on crop susceptibility to pests, such as BPH.
28643516	Untargeted Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography Coupled with High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Rice Metabolome Using Multivariate Curve Resolution.	2017	Anal Chem	In this work, a new strategy for the chemometric analysis of two-dimensional liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC × LC-HRMS) data is proposed. This approach consists of a preliminary compression step along the mass spectrometry (MS) spectral dimension based on the selection of the regions of interest (ROI), followed by a further data compression along the chromatographic dimension by wavelet transforms. In a secondary step, the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method is applied to previously compressed data sets obtained in the simultaneous analysis of multiple LC × LC-HRMS chromatographic runs from multiple samples. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by its application to a large experimental data set obtained in the untargeted LC × LC-HRMS study of the effects of different environmental conditions (watering and harvesting time) on the metabolism of multiple rice samples. An untargeted chromatographic setup coupling two different liquid chromatography (LC) columns [hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)] together with an HRMS detector was developed and applied to analyze the metabolites extracted from rice samples at the different experimental conditions. In the case of the metabolomics study taken as example in this work, a total number of 154 metabolites from 15 different families were properly resolved after the application of MCR-ALS. A total of 139 of these metabolites could be identified by their HRMS spectra. Statistical analysis of their concentration changes showed that both watering and harvest time experimental factors had significant effects on rice metabolism. The biochemical insight of the effects of watering and harvesting experimental factors on the changes in concentration of these detected metabolites in the investigated rice samples is attempted.
28718009	Relative salinity tolerance of rice cultivars native to North East India: a physiological, biochemical and molecular perspective.	2017	Protoplasma	Salinity is the second most prevalent abiotic stress faced by plants, and rice is not an exception. Through this study, it has been tried upon, to study the relative salinity tolerance of eight local varieties of North East India. Preliminary screening was based on their dose- and time-dependent physiological responses to salinity stress. Among the cultivars, Tampha was found to be relatively more tolerant, whereas MSE9 the most sensitive. To further ascertain their tolerance capacity, MDA and H2O2 content was determined, which also confirmed the tolerance level of the two cultivars. Histochemical assays for root plasma membrane integrity and leaf and root H2O2 and O2- content also showed more damage in Tampha in comparison to MSE9. Finally, gene expression analysis for Na+/K+ co-transporters, OsHKT2;1, OsHKT2;3 and OsHKT2;4, was performed to observe how the expression level of these transporters varies with the tolerance capacity of these two cultivars in leaves and roots under different time frames. The study reveals Tampha to be the most tolerant and MSE9 the most sensitive when compared to the other six screened cultivars for salinity stress.
28758833	Differentially localized rice ethylene receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their potential role during submergence.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Ethylene is gaseous plant hormone that controls a variety of physiologic activities. OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions. The GFP fused N-terminus of OsERS1 and OsETR2 showed differentially localization patterns when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Base on these results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, instead of the constitutive expression profile of OsERS1, OsETR2 is differentially expressed in seedlings of light/dark-grown conditions, submergence or exogenous ethylene treatments. Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence.
28744298	<i>Poaceae</i> vs. Abiotic Stress: Focus on Drought and Salt Stress, Recent Insights and Perspectives.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Poaceae represent the most important group of crops susceptible to abiotic stress. This large family of monocotyledonous plants, commonly known as grasses, counts several important cultivated species, namely wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). These crops, notably, show different behaviors under abiotic stress conditions: wheat and rice are considered sensitive, showing serious yield reduction upon water scarcity and soil salinity, while barley presents a natural drought and salt tolerance. During the green revolution (1940-1960), cereal breeding was very successful in developing high-yield crops varieties; however, these cultivars were maximized for highest yield under optimal conditions, and did not present suitable traits for tolerance under unfavorable conditions. The improvement of crop abiotic stress tolerance requires a deep knowledge of the phenomena underlying tolerance, to devise novel approaches and decipher the key components of agricultural production systems. Approaches to improve food production combining both enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and acceptable yields are critical to create a sustainable agriculture in the future. This paper analyzes the latest results on abiotic stress tolerance in Poaceae. In particular, the focus will be directed toward various aspects of water deprivation and salinity response efficiency in Poaceae. Aspects related to cell wall metabolism will be covered, given the importance of the plant cell wall in sensing environmental constraints and in mediating a response; the role of silicon (Si), an important element for monocots' normal growth and development, will also be discussed, since it activates a broad-spectrum response to different exogenous stresses. Perspectives valorizing studies on landraces conclude the survey, as they help identify key traits for breeding purposes.
28688359	Influence of silicon treatment on antimony uptake and translocation in rice genotypes with different radial oxygen loss.	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Antimony (Sb) pollution in soil may have a negative impact on the health of people consuming rice. This study investigated the effect of silicon (Si) application on rice biomass, iron plaque formation, and Sb uptake and speciation in rice plants with different radial oxygen loss (ROL) using pot experiments. The results demonstrated that Si addition increased the biomass of straw and grain, but had no obvious impact on the root biomass. Indica genotypes with higher ROL underwent greater iron plaque formation and exhibited more Sb sequestration in iron plaque. Silicon treatments increased iron levels in iron plaque from the different genotypes but decreased the total Sb concentration in root, straw, husk, and grain. In addition, Si treatment reduced the inorganic Sb concentrations but slightly increased the trimethylantimony (TMSb) concentrations in rice straw. Moreover, rice straw from hybrid genotypes accumulated higher concentrations of TMSb and inorganic Sb than that from indica genotypes. The conclusions from this study indicate that Sb contamination in rice can be efficiently reduced by applying Si treatment and selecting genotypes with high ROL.
28751884	Accumulation of Azole Drugs in the Fungal Plant Pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Is the Result of Facilitated Diffusion Influx.	2017	Front Microbiol	Magnaporthe oryzae is an agricultural mold that causes disease in rice, resulting in devastating crop losses. Since rice is a world-wide staple food crop, infection by M. oryzae poses a serious global food security threat. Fungicides, including azole antifungals, are used to prevent and combat M. oryzae plant infections. The target of azoles is CYP51, an enzyme localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and required for fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. However, many basic drug-pathogen interactions, such as how the azole gets past the fungal cell wall and plasma membrane, and is transported to the ER, are not understood. In addition, reduced intracellular accumulation of antifungals has consistently been observed as a drug resistance mechanism in many fungal species. Studying the basic biology of drug-pathogen interactions may elucidate uncharacterized mechanisms of drug resistance and susceptibility in M. oryzae and potentially other related fungal pathogens. We characterized intracellular accumulation of azole drugs in M. oryzae using a radioactively labeled fluconazole uptake assay to gain insight on whether azoles enter the cell by passive diffusion, active transport, or facilitated diffusion. We show that azole accumulation is not ATP-dependent, nor does it rely on a pH-dependent process. Instead there is evidence for azole drug uptake in M. oryzae by a facilitated diffusion mechanism. The uptake system is specific for azole or azole-like compounds and can be modulated depending on cell phase and growth media. In addition, we found that co-treatment of M. oryzae with 'repurposed' clorgyline and radio-labeled fluconazole prevented energy-dependent efflux of fluconazole, resulting in an increased intracellular concentration of fluconazole in the fungal cell.
28758876	WRKY45 phosphorylation at threonine 266 acts negatively on WRKY45-dependent blast resistance in rice.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	WRKY45 is a central regulator of disease resistance mediated by salicylic acid signaling in rice and its activation involves phosphorylation by OsMPK6. OsMPK6 phosphorylates WRKY45 at Thr266, Ser294, and Ser299 in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser294 and/or Ser299 is required for full activation of WRKY45, but the importance of Thr266 phosphorylation has remained unknown. Here, we report on the characterization of Thr266 phosphorylation of WRKY45 in rice. Transient expression of mutant WRKY45 revealed that Thr266 is phosphorylated in vivo, together with Ser294/299. Replacement of Thr266 by Asn did not affect the enhanced Magnaporthe oryzae resistance afforded by WRKY45 overexpression. By contrast, replacement by Asp negated the enhancement of M. oryzae resistance. These results suggest that Thr266 phosphorylation acts negatively on WRKY45-dependent disease resistance.
28769823	Elevated Carbon Dioxide Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Decreasing Cell Wall Hemicellulose in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>).	2017	Front Physiol	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is involved in plant growth as well as plant responses to abiotic stresses; however, it remains unclear whether CO2 is involved in the response of rice (Oryza sativa) to aluminum (Al) toxicity. In the current study, we discovered that elevated CO2 (600 μL·L-1) significantly alleviated Al-induced inhibition of root elongation that occurred in ambient CO2 (400 μL·L-1). This protective effect was accompanied by a reduced Al accumulation in root apex. Al significantly induced citrate efflux and the expression of OsALS1, but elevated CO2 had no further effect. By contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased Al-induced accumulation of hemicellulose, as well as its Al retention. As a result, the amount of Al fixed in the cell wall was reduced, indicating an alleviation of Al-induced damage to cell wall function. Furthermore, elevated CO2 decreased the Al-induced root nitric oxide (NO) accumulation, and the addition of the NO scavenger c-PTIO (2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide) abolished this alleviation effect, indicating that NO maybe involved in the CO2-alleviated Al toxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the alleviation of Al toxicity in rice by elevated CO2 is mediated by decreasing hemicellulose content and the Al fixation in the cell wall, possibly via the NO pathway.
28724910	Investigating glycemic potential of rice by unraveling compositional variations in mature grain and starch mobilization patterns during seed germination.	2017	Sci Rep	Rice lines with slower starch digestibility provide opportunities in mitigating the global rise in type II diabetes and related non-communicable diseases. However, screening for low glycemic index (GI) in rice breeding programs is not possible due to time and cost constraints. This study evaluated the feasibility of using in vitro cooked grain amylolysis, starch mobilization patterns during seed germination, and variation in starch structure and composition in the mature seed to differentiate patterns of starch digestibility. Mobilization patterns of total starch, resistant starch, amylose and amylopectin chains, and free sugars during seed germination revealed that the process is analogous to digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract. The combination of these biochemical markers can be used as an alternative measure to predict GI. Additionally, transcriptome analysis of stored mRNA transcripts in high and low GI lines detected differences in starch metabolism and confirmed the importance of seed storage pathways in influencing digestibility. Pathway analyses supported by metabolomics data revealed that resistant starch, cell wall non-starch polysaccharides and flavonoids potentially contribute to slower digestibility. These new insights can guide precision breeding programs to produce low GI rice with acceptable cooking quality to help mitigate the burden of diet-associated lifestyle diseases.
28702689	Molecular responses to recurrent drought in two contrasting rice genotypes.	2017	Planta	MAIN CONCLUSION: The set of variables analyzed as integrated by multivariate analysis of principal components consistently showed a memory effect induced by the drought pre-treatment in AN Cambará plants. The effects of drought can vary ddepending on many factors. Among these the occurrence of a previous water stress may leave a residual effect (memory), influencing the future performance of a plant in response to a new drought event. This study tested the hypothesis that plants experiencing recurrent drought would show more active mechanisms of water deficit tolerance, mainly plants of the genotype that is cultivated often experiencing water shortages periods. Additionally, all the plants subjected to water deficit were rehydrated by 24 h and the expression of transcription factors related to drought responses was re-evaluated. To this end, the water status of two rice genotypes, BRS Querência (flooded) and AN Cambará (dryland), was evaluated to identify molecular alterations likely underpinning drought-memory. In growth stage V5, some plants were exposed to water stress (10% VWC soil moisture-pre-treatment). Thereafter, the pots were rehydrated at the same level as the control pots and maintained under this condition until drought was reapplied (10% VWC) at the reproductive stage (R1-R2). Then, the plants were rehydrated and maintained at pot capacity for 24 h. Overall, the set of variables analyzed integrally by multivariate analysis of principal components consistently showed a memory effect induced by the drought pre-treatment in AN Cambará plants (the dryland genotype). This conclusion, based on data of the biochemical and molecular analyses, was supported by the greater capacity of maintenance of the water status by stomatal regulation of the pre-treated and rehydrated plants after the second drought stimulus.
28686596	Genetic control of the root system in rice under normal and drought stress conditions by genome-wide association study.	2017	PLoS Genet	A variety of adverse conditions including drought stress severely affect rice production. Root system plays a critical role in drought avoidance, which is one of the major mechanisms of drought resistance. In this study, we adopted genome-wide association study (GWAS) to dissect the genetic basis controlling various root traits by using a natural population consisting of 529 representative rice accessions. A total of 413 suggestive associations, containing 143 significant associations, were identified for 21 root traits, such as maximum root length, root volume, and root dry weight under normal and drought stress conditions at the maturation stage. More than 80 percent of the suggestive loci were located in the region of reported QTLs for root traits, while about 20 percent of suggestive loci were novel loci detected in this study. Besides, 11 reported root-related genes, including DRO1, WOX11, and OsPID, were found to co-locate with the association loci. We further proved that the association results can facilitate the efficient identification of causal genes for root traits by the two case studies of Nal1 and OsJAZ1. These loci and their candidate causal genes provide an important basis for the genetic improvement of root traits and drought resistance.
28705931	Proof of Concept: Design and Initial Evaluation of a Device to Measure Gastrointestinal Transit Time.	2017	J Nucl Med Technol	Chronic constipation and gastrointestinal motility disorders constitute a large part of a gastroenterology practice and have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and lifestyle. In most cases, medications are prescribed to alleviate symptoms without there being an objective measurement of response. Commonly used investigations of gastrointestinal transit times are currently limited to radiopaque markers or electronic capsules. Repeated use of these techniques is limited because of the radiation exposure and the significant cost of the devices. We present the proof of concept for a new device to measure gastrointestinal transit time using commonly available and inexpensive materials with only a small amount of radiotracer. Methods: We assembled gelatin capsules containing a 67Ga-citrate-radiolabeled grain of rice embedded in paraffin for use as a point-source transit device. It was tested for stability in vitro and subsequently was given orally to 4 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with constipation or diarrhea. Imaging was performed at regular intervals until the device was excreted. Results: The device remained intact and visible as a point source in all subjects until excretion. When used along with a diary of bowel movement times and dates, the device could determine the total transit time. The device could be visualized either alone or in combination with a barium small-bowel follow-through study or a gastric emptying study. Conclusion: The use of a point-source transit device for the determination of gastrointestinal transit time is a feasible alternative to other methods. The device is inexpensive and easy to assemble, requires only a small amount of radiotracer, and remains inert throughout the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for accurate determination of gastrointestinal transit time. Further investigation of the device is required to establish optimum imaging parameters and reference values. Measurements of gastrointestinal transit time may be useful in managing patients with dysmotility and in selecting the appropriate pharmaceutical treatment.
28747889	Distribution of Silicified Microstructures, Regulation of Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Lodging Resistance in Silicon and Paclobutrazol Mediated <i>Oryza sativa</i>.	2017	Front Physiol	Lodging is a phenomenon that affects most of the cereal crops including rice, Oryza sativa. This is due to the fragile nature of herbaceous plants whose stems are non-woody, thus affecting its ability to grow upright. Silicon (Si), a beneficial nutrient is often used to toughen and protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. Deposition of Si in plant tissues enhances the rigidity and stiffness of the plant as a whole. Silicified cells provide the much needed strength to the culm to resist breaking. Lignin plays important roles in cell wall structural integrity, stem strength, transport, mechanical support, and plant pathogen defense. The aim of this study is to resolve effects of Si on formation of microstructure and regulation of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), a key gene responsible for lignin biosynthesis. Besides evaluating silicon, paclobutrazol (PBZ) a plant growth retartdant that reduces internode elongation is also incorporated in this study. Hardness, brittleness and stiffness were improved in presence of silicon thus reducing lodging. Scanning electron micrographs with the aid of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) was used to map silicon distribution. Presence of trichomes, silica cells, and silica bodies were detected in silicon treated plants. Transcripts of CAD gene was also upregulated in these plants. Besides, phloroglucinol staining showed presence of lignified vascular bundles and sclerenchyma band. In conclusion, silicon treated rice plants showed an increase in lignin content, silicon content, and formation of silicified microstructures.
28725262	Comparison of four glycosyl residue composition methods for effectiveness in detecting sugars from cell walls of dicot and grass tissues.	2017	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: The effective use of plant biomass for biofuel and bioproduct production requires a comprehensive glycosyl residue composition analysis to understand the different cell wall polysaccharides present in the different biomass sources. Here we compared four methods side-by-side for their ability to measure the neutral and acidic sugar composition of cell walls from herbaceous, grass, and woody model plants and bioenergy feedstocks.

RESULTS: Arabidopsis, Populus, rice, and switchgrass leaf cell walls, as well as cell walls from Populus wood, rice stems, and switchgrass tillers, were analyzed by (1) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of alditol acetates combined with a total uronic acid assay; (2) carbodiimide reduction of uronic acids followed by GC-MS of alditol acetates; (3) GC-MS of trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives; and (4) high-pressure, anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). All four methods gave comparable abundance ranking of the seven neutral sugars, and three of the methods were able to quantify unique acidic sugars. The TMS, HPAEC, and carbodiimide methods provided comparable quantitative results for the specific neutral and acidic sugar content of the biomass, with the TMS method providing slightly greater yield of specific acidic sugars and high total sugar yields. The alditol acetate method, while providing comparable information on the major neutral sugars, did not provide the requisite quantitative information on the specific acidic sugars in plant biomass. Thus, the alditol acetate method is the least informative of the four methods.

CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a side-by-side comparison of the efficacy of four different established glycosyl residue composition analysis methods in the analysis of the glycosyl residue composition of cell walls from both dicot (Arabidopsis and Populus) and grass (rice and switchgrass) species. Both primary wall-enriched leaf tissues and secondary wall-enriched wood/stem tissues were analyzed for mol% and mass yield of the non-cellulosic sugars. The TMS, HPAEC, and carbodiimide methods were shown to provide comparable quantitative data on the nine neutral and acidic sugars present in all plant cell walls.
28775730	Simultaneous Improvement and Genetic Dissection of Salt Tolerance of Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) by Designed QTL Pyramiding.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Breeding of multi-stress tolerant rice varieties with higher grain yields is the best option to enhance the rice productivity of abiotic stresses prone areas. It also poses the greatest challenge to plant breeders to breed rice varieties for such stress prone conditions. Here, we carried out a designed QTL pyramiding experiment to develop high yielding "Green Super Rice" varieties with significantly improved tolerance to salt stress and grain yield. Using the F4 population derived from a cross between two selected introgression lines, we were able to develop six mostly homozygous promising high yielding lines with significantly improved salt tolerance and grain yield under optimal and/or saline conditions in 3 years. Simultaneous mapping using the same breeding population and tunable genotyping-by-sequencing technology, we identified three QTL affecting salt injury score and leaf chlorophyll content. By analyzing 32M SNP data of the grandparents and graphical genotypes of the parents, we discovered 87 positional candidate genes for salt tolerant QTL. According to their functional annotation, we inferred the most likely candidate genes. We demonstrated that designed QTL pyramiding is a powerful strategy for simultaneous improvement and genetic dissection of complex traits in rice.
28861103	Integrated RNA Sequencing and QTL Mapping to Identify Candidate Genes from <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> Associated with Salt Tolerance at the Seedling Stage.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Soil salinity is a common abiotic stress affecting crop productivity. To identify favorable alleles from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) that enhance salinity tolerance of rice (O. sativa L.), a set of introgression lines (ILs) were developed. The ILs were derived from an O. rufipogon accession collected from Chaling (Hunan Province, China) as the donor, and a widely grown O. sativa indica cultivar 93-11 as the recipient. Through evaluating the salt tolerance of 285 ILs at the seedling stage, a total of 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to salt tolerance were identified on chromosomes 1, 5, 7 and 9-12, with individual QTLs explaining 2-8% of phenotypic variance. The O. rufipogon-derived alleles at four QTLs improved salt tolerance in the 93-11 background. At the same time, a salt-tolerant IL, 9L136, was identified and characterized. Compared with the recipient parent 93-11, a total of 1,391 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected specifically in 9L136 between salt stress and normal condition through genome-wide expression analysis. Of these, four DEGs located in the QTL regions carried by 9L136, suggesting that the four genes might be candidates associated with salt tolerance. Both the highly salt-tolerant ILs and the favorable O. rufipogon-derived QTLs identified in the present study will provide new genetic resources for improving the resistance of cultivated rice against salinity stress using molecular breeding strategies in the future.
28809396	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	2017	Cell Res	Strigolactones (SLs), a group of carotenoid derived terpenoid lactones, are root-to-shoot phytohormones suppressing shoot branching by inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds. DWARF 53 (D53), the key repressor of the SL signaling pathway, is speculated to regulate the downstream transcriptional network of the SL response. However, no downstream transcription factor targeted by D53 has yet been reported. Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression. We showed that D53 interacts with IPA1 in vivo and in vitro and suppresses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1. We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression. These findings reveal that IPA1 is likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice.
28802080	Segmental allotetraploidy generates extensive homoeologous expression rewiring and phenotypic diversity at the population level in rice.	2017	Mol Ecol	Allopolyploidization, that is, concomitant merging and doubling of two or more divergent genomes in a common nucleus/cytoplasm, is known to instantly alter genomewide transcriptome dynamics, a phenomenon referred to as "transcriptomic shock." However, the immediate effects of transcriptomic alteration in generating phenotypic diversity at the population level remain underinvestigated. Here, we employed the MassARRAY-based Sequenom platform to assess and compare orthologous, allelic and homoeologous gene expression status in two tissues (leaf and root) of a set of randomly chosen individuals from populations of parental rice subspecies (indica and japonica), in vitro "hybrids" (parental mixes), reciprocal F1 hybrids and reciprocal tetraploids at the 5th-selfed generation (S5). We show that hybridization and whole genome duplication (WGD) have opposing effects on allelic and homoeologous expression in the F1 hybrids and tetraploids, respectively. Whereas hybridization exerts strong attenuating effects on allelic expression differences in diploid hybrids, WGD augments the intrinsic parental differences and generates extensive and variable homoeolog content which triggers diversification in expression patterning among the tetraploid plants. Coupled with the vast phenotypic diversity observed among the tetraploid individuals, our results provide experimental evidence in support of the notion that allopolyploidy catalyses rapid phenotypic diversification in higher plants. Our data further suggest that largely stochastic homoeolog content reshuffling rather than alteration in total expression level may be an important feature of evolution in young segmental allopolyploids, which underlies rapid expression diversity at the population level.
28868059	Integrating Early Transcriptomic Responses to Rhizotoxins in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa.</i> L.) Reveals Key Regulators and a Potential Early Biomarker of Cadmium Toxicity.	2017	Front Plant Sci	As sessile organisms, plants were constantly challenged with biotic and abiotic stresses. Transcriptional activation of stress-responsive genes is a crucial part of the plant adaptation to environmental changes. Here, early response of rice root to eight rhizotoxic stressors: arsenate, copper, cadmium, mercury, chromate, vanadate, ferulic acid and juglone, was analyzed using published microarray data. There were 539 general stress response (GSR) genes up-regulated under all eight treatments, including genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, phytohormone balance, and cell wall structure. Genes related to transcriptional coactivation showed higher Ka/Ks ratio compared to the other GSR genes. Network analysis discovered complicated interaction within GSR genes and the most connected signaling hubs were WRKY53, WRKY71, and MAPK5. Promoter analysis discovers enriched SCGCGCS cis-element in GSR genes. Moreover, GSR genes tend to be intronless and genes with shorter total intron length were induced in a higher level. Among genes uniquely up-regulated by a single stress, a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK) was identified as a candidate biomarker for detecting cadmium contamination. Our findings provide insights into the transcriptome dynamics of molecular response of rice to different rhizotoxic stress and also demonstrate potential use of comparative transcriptome analysis in identifying a novel potential early biomarker.
28810845	A bioinformatics approach for identifying transgene insertion sites using whole genome sequencing data.	2017	BMC Biotechnol	BACKGROUND: Genetically modified crops (GM crops) have been developed to improve the agricultural traits of modern crop cultivars. Safety assessments of GM crops are of paramount importance in research at developmental stages and before releasing transgenic plants into the marketplace. Sequencing technology is developing rapidly, with higher output and labor efficiencies, and will eventually replace existing methods for the molecular characterization of genetically modified organisms.

METHODS: To detect the transgenic insertion locations in the three GM rice gnomes, Illumina sequencing reads are mapped and classified to the rice genome and plasmid sequence. The both mapped reads are classified to characterize the junction site between plant and transgene sequence by sequence alignment.

RESULTS: Herein, we present a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular characterization method, using transgenic rice plants SNU-Bt9-5, SNU-Bt9-30, and SNU-Bt9-109. Specifically, using bioinformatics tools, we detected the precise insertion locations and copy numbers of transfer DNA, genetic rearrangements, and the absence of backbone sequences, which were equivalent to results obtained from Southern blot analyses.

CONCLUSION: NGS methods have been suggested as an effective means of characterizing and detecting transgenic insertion locations in genomes. Our results demonstrate the use of a combination of NGS technology and bioinformatics approaches that offers cost- and time-effective methods for assessing the safety of transgenic plants.
28848243	Prominent topologically associated domains differentiate global chromatin packing in rice from Arabidopsis.	2017	Nat Plants	The non-random three-dimensional organization of genomes is critical for many cellular processes. Recently, analyses of genome-wide chromatin packing in the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been reported 1-4 . At a kilobase scale, the A. thaliana chromatin interaction network is highly correlated with a range of genomic and epigenomic features 1-4 . Surprisingly, topologically associated domains (TADs), which appear to be a prevalent structural feature of genome packing in many animal species, are not prominent in the A. thaliana genome 1,2,4-6 . Using a genome-wide chromatin conformation capture approach, Hi-C (ref. 7 ), we report high-resolution chromatin packing patterns of another model plant, rice. We unveil new structural features of chromatin organization at both chromosomal and local levels compared to A. thaliana, with thousands of distinct TADs that cover about a quarter of the rice genome. The rice TAD boundaries are associated with euchromatic epigenetic marks and active gene expression, and enriched with a sequence motif that can be recognized by plant-specific TCP proteins. In addition, we report chromosome decondensation in rice seedlings undergoing cold stress, despite local chromatin packing patterns remaining largely unchanged. The substantial variation found already in a comparison of two plant species suggests that chromatin organization in plants might be more diverse than in multicellular animals.
28861102	Comparative Transcriptome Analyses of Gene Expression Changes Triggered by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> AG1 IA Infection in Resistant and Susceptible Rice Varieties.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most devastating diseases for stable rice production in most rice-growing regions of the world. Currently, studies of the molecular mechanism of rice sheath blight resistance are scarce. Here, we used an RNA-seq approach to analyze the gene expression changes induced by the AG1 IA strain of R. solani in rice at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h. By comparing the transcriptomes of TeQing (a moderately resistant cultivar) and Lemont (a susceptible cultivar) leaves, variable transcriptional responses under control and infection conditions were revealed. From these data, 4,802 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses suggested that most DEGs and related metabolic pathways in both rice genotypes were common and spanned most biological activities after AG1 IA inoculation. The main difference between the resistant and susceptible plants was a difference in the timing of the response to AG1 IA infection. Photosynthesis, photorespiration, and jasmonic acid and phenylpropanoid metabolism play important roles in disease resistance, and the relative response of disease resistance-related pathways in TeQing leaves was more rapid than that of Lemont leaves at 12 h. Here, the transcription data include the most comprehensive list of genes and pathway candidates induced by AG1 IA that is available for rice and will serve as a resource for future studies into the molecular mechanisms of the responses of rice to AG1 IA.
28841500	Reduced arsenic accumulation in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar with ferromanganese oxide impregnated biochar composites amendments.	2017	Environ Pollut	The effects of biochar (BC) and ferromanganese oxide biochar composites (FMBC1 and FMBC2) on As (Arsenic) accumulation in rice were determined using a pot experiment. Treatments with BC or FMBC improved the dry weights of rice roots, stems, leaves, and grains in soils containing different As contamination levels. Compared to BC treatment, FMBC treatments significantly reduced As accumulation in different parts of the rice plants (P < 0.05), and FMBC2 performed better than FMBC1 did. Furthermore, exposure to 2% FMBC2 decreased the total As concentration in the grain by 68.9-78.3%. The addition of FMBC increased the ratio of essential amino acids in the grain, decreased As availability in the soil, and significantly increased the Fe and Mn plaque contents. The reduced As accumulation in rice can be attributed to As(III) to As(V) oxidation by ferro - manganese binary oxide, which increased the As adsorbed by FMBC. Furthermore, Fe and Mn plaques on the rice root surface decreased the transport of As in rice. Taken together, our results demonstrated the applicability of FMBC as a potential measure for reducing As accumulation in rice, improving the amino acid content of rice grains, and effectively remediating As-polluted soil.
28805257	Three representative inter and intra-subspecific crosses reveal the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in rice.	2017	Plant J	Systematic characterization of genetic and molecular mechanisms in the formation of hybrid sterility is of fundamental importance in understanding reproductive isolation and speciation. Using ultra-high-density genetic maps, 43 single-locus quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 223 digenic interactions for embryo-sac, pollen, and spikelet fertility are depicted from three crosses between representative varieties of japonica and two varietal groups of indica, which provide an extensive archive for investigating the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in rice. Ten newly detected single-locus QTLs for inter- and intra-subspecific fertility are identified. Three loci for embryo-sac fertility are detected in both Nip × ZS97 and Nip × MH63 crosses, whereas QTLs for pollen fertility are not in common between the two crosses thus leading to fertility variation. Five loci responsible for fertility and segregation distortion are observed in the ZS97 × MH63 cross. The importance of two-locus interactions on fertility are quantified in the whole genome, which identify that three types of interaction contribute to fertility reduction in the hybrid. These results construct the genetic architecture with respect to various forms of reproductive barriers in rice, which have significant implications in utilization of inter-subspecific heterosis along with improvement in the fertility of indica-indica hybrids at single- and multi-locus level.
28815858	Loss of chloroplast-localized protein phosphatase 2Cs in Arabidopsis thaliana leads to enhancement of plant immunity and resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris infection.	2017	Mol Plant Pathol	Protein phosphatases (PPs) counteract kinases in reversible phosphorylation events during numerous signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. PP2Cs, one of the four major classes of the serine/threonine-specific PP family, are greatly expanded in plants. Thus, PP2Cs are thought to play a specific role in signal transduction pathways. Some rice PP2Cs classified in subgroup K are responsive to infection by the compatible Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight. In Arabidopsis thaliana, orthologous PP2C genes (AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26) classified to subgroup K are also responsive to Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc, causal agent of black rot) infection. To elucidate the function of these subgroup K PP2Cs, atpp2c62- and atpp2c26-deficient A. thaliana mutants were characterized. A double mutant plant which was inoculated with a compatible Xcc showed reduced lesion development, as well as the suppression of bacterial multiplication. AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26 localized to the chloroplast. Furthermore, the photosynthesis-related protein, chaperonin-60, was indicated as the potential candidate for the dephosphorylated substrate catalysed by AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26 using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-IDF-SDS-PAGE). Taken together, AtPP2C62 and AtPP2C26 are suggested to be involved in both photosynthesis and suppression of the plant immune system. These results imply the occurrence of crosstalk between photosynthesis and the plant defence system to control productivity under pathogen infection.
28863212	A Young Seedling Stripe2 phenotype in rice is caused by mutation of a chloroplast-localized nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 required for chloroplast biogenesis.	None	Genet Mol Biol	Chloroplast development and chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in plants are regulated by many genes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. We isolated a rice mutant named yss2 (young seedling stripe2) with a striated seedling phenotype beginning from leaf 2 of delayed plant growth. The mutant developed normal green leaves from leaf 5, but reduced tillering and chlorotic leaves and panicles appeared later. Chlorotic yss2 seedlings have decreased pigment contents and impaired chloroplast development. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant phenotype was due to a single recessive gene. Positional cloning and sequence analysis identified a single nucleotide substitution in YSS2 gene causing an amino acid change from Gly to Asp. The YSS2 allele encodes a NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2) protein showing high similarity to other types of NDPKs. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that YSS2 transcripts accumulated highly in L4 sections at the early leaf development stage. Expression levels of genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis in yss2 were mostly decreased, but genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis were up-regulated compared to the wild type. The YSS2 protein was associated with punctate structures in the chloroplasts of rice protoplasts. Our overall data suggest that YSS2 has important roles in chloroplast biogenesis.
28785299	Quantitation of glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) roots exposed to cadmium by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using isotope-labeled wing peptides as an internal standard.	2017	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18) are multifunctional enzymes involved in heavy metal cellular detoxification by conjugating the tripeptide (g-Glu-Cys-Gly) glutathione to heavy metals. Previous studies demonstrated that individual rice GSTs were differentially induced by heavy metal exposure at the mRNA transcript level. However, little information is available concerning changes in protein concentration of rice GSTs under heavy metal stress. Because the correlation between changes in protein concentration and gene expression under abiotic stress is poor, direct determination of rice GSTs protein concentrations during cadmium (Cd) exposure is a more effective and reliable approach to explore possible mechanisms of rice Cd translocation and accumulation.

RESULTS: This study established an optimized and advanced liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based targeted proteomics assay for quantification of OsGSTF14 and OsGSTU6 proteins in Cd-stressed rice roots. The tryptic signature peptides were chosen as surrogate analytes and winged peptides containing the isotope-labeled signature peptides were used as the internal standards. The signature peptides exhibited good linearity in the range of 0.6-60 and 0.3-30 nM, respectively. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 4.5 and 14.5 µg/g for OsGSTF14, respectively, and 2.1 and 7.0 µg/g for OsGSTU6. The spiking recoveries rates at low, medium and high levels were in the range of 72.5-93.4%, with intra- and inter-day precisions of 5.5-9.1 and 4.2-10.2%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The assay successfully quantified the temporal and dose responses of OsGSTF14 and OsGSTU6 proteins in Cd-stressed rice roots, with good accuracy, precision and high-throughput. This assay will have significant application in developing quantification methods of other proteins in Cd-stressed rice, which may provide more insight into the mechanisms of Cd translocation and accumulation in rice.
28861736	Identification and fine mapping of a new gene, BPH31 conferring resistance to brown planthopper biotype 4 of India to improve rice, Oryza sativa L.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the staple food for more than 3.5 billion people, mainly in Asia. Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice that limits rice production. Host-plant resistance is one of the most efficient ways to overcome BPH damage to the rice crop.

RESULTS: BPH bioassay studies from 2009 to 2015 conducted in India and at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, revealed that the cultivar CR2711-76 developed at the National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), Cuttack, India, showed stable and broad-spectrum resistance to several BPH populations of the Philippines and BPH biotype 4 of India. Genetic analysis and fine mapping confirmed the presence of a single dominant gene, BPH31, in CR2711-76 conferring BPH resistance. The BPH31 gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 3 within an interval of 475 kb between the markers PA26 and RM2334. Bioassay analysis of the BPH31 gene in CR2711-76 was carried out against BPH populations of the Philippines. The results from bioassay revealed that CR2711-76 possesses three different mechanisms of resistance: antibiosis, antixenosis, and tolerance. The effectiveness of flanking markers was tested in a segregating population and the InDel type markers PA26 and RM2334 showed high co-segregation with the resistance phenotype. Foreground and background analysis by tightly linked markers as well as using the Infinium 6 K SNP chip respectively were applied for transferring the BPH31 gene into an indica variety, Jaya. The improved BPH31-derived Jaya lines showed strong resistance to BPH biotypes of India and the Philippines.

CONCLUSION: The new BPH31 gene can be used in BPH resistance breeding programs on the Indian subcontinent. The tightly linked DNA markers identified in the study have proved their effectiveness and can be utilized in BPH resistance breeding in rice.
28821602	Large-scale Proteomics Combined with Transgenic Experiments Demonstrates An Important Role of Jasmonic Acid in Potassium Deficiency Response in Wheat and Rice.	2017	Mol Cell Proteomics	Potassium (K+) is the most abundant inorganic cation in plants, and molecular dissection of K+ deficiency has received considerable interest in order to minimize K+ fertilizer input and develop high quality K+-efficient crops. However, the molecular mechanism of plant responses to K+ deficiency is still poorly understood. In this study, 2-week-old bread wheat seedlings grown hydroponically in Hoagland solution were transferred to K+-free conditions for 8 d, and their root and leaf proteome profiles were assessed using the iTRAQ proteome method. Over 4000 unique proteins were identified, and 818 K+-responsive protein species showed significant differences in abundance. The differentially expressed protein species were associated with diverse functions and exhibited organ-specific differences. Most of the differentially expressed protein species related to hormone synthesis were involved in jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis and the upregulated abundance of JA synthesis-related enzymes could result in the increased JA concentrations. Abundance of allene oxide synthase (AOS), one key JA synthesis-related enzyme, was significantly increased in K+-deficient wheat seedlings, and its overexpression markedly increased concentrations of K+ and JA, altered the transcription levels of some genes encoding K+-responsive protein species, as well as enhanced the tolerance of rice plants to low K+ or K+ deficiency. Moreover, rice AOS mutant (osaos) exhibited more sensitivity to low K+ or K+ deficiency. Our findings could highlight the importance of JA in K+ deficiency, and imply a network of molecular processes underlying plant responses to K+ deficiency.
28843766	Exploiting DELLA Signaling in Cereals.	2017	Trends Plant Sci	The spectacular yield increases in rice and wheat during the green revolution were partly realized by reduced gibberellin (GA) synthesis or sensitivity, both causing the accumulation of DELLA proteins. Although insights into the regulation of plant growth and development by DELLA proteins advanced rapidly in arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), DELLA-mediated regulation of downstream responses in cereals has received little attention to date. Furthermore, translating this research from arabidopsis to cereals is challenging given their different growth patterns and our phylogenetic analysis which reveals that DELLA-related DGLLA proteins exist in cereals but not in arabidopsis. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of DELLA function in cereals holds great potential to improve yield. In this review, we propose to extend the focus of DELLA functional research to cereals, and highlight the appropriate tools that are now available to achieve this.
28843203	Mitigation of Cd accumulation in paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Fe fertilization.	2017	Environ Pollut	Cadmium uptake in rice is believed to be mediated by the Fe transport system. Phyto-available Cd can be changed by Fe fertilization of substrates. This work investigated whether and how Fe fertilization affects mitigation of Cd accumulation in paddy rice. A 90-d soil column experiment was conducted to study the change of Cd and Fe availability in soil after Fe fertilization (ionic and chelated Fe). A low-Cd accumulating cultivar (TY116) and a high-Cd accumulating cultivar (JY841) were grown in two Cd-polluted paddy soils amended with chelated Fe fertilizers. Additionally, both cultivars were grown in hydroponics to compare Fe-related gene expression in EDDHAFe-deficient and EDDHAFe-sufficient roots. The column experiment showed that EDTANa2Fe(II) and EDDHAFe(III) fertilization had a better mitigation effect on soil Cd availability compared to FeSO4·7H2O. Moreover, the field experiment demonstrated that these two chelated fertilizations could reduce Cd concentrations in brown rice by up to 80%. Iron concentrations in the brown rice were elevated by Fe chelates. Compared to EDDHAFe(III), EDTANa2Fe(II) fertilization had a stronger mitigation effect by generating more EDTANa2Cd(II) in the soil solution to decrease phyto-available Cd in the soil. While EDDHAFe(III) fertilization could increase soil pH and decrease soil Eh which contributed to decreasing phyto-available Cd in a contaminated soil. In the hydroponic experiment, Fe sufficiency significantly reduced Cd concentrations in above-ground organs. In some cases, the expression of OsIRT1, OsNRAMP1 and OsNRAMP5 was inhibited under Fe sufficiency relative to Fe deficiency conditions. These results suggest that mitigation of rice Cd by Fe chelate fertilization results from a decrease in available Cd in substrates and the inhibition of the expression of several Fe-related genes in the IRT and NRAMP families.
28766258	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) resistance is dependent on at least four QTLs in the rice genome.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Rice blast is the most serious disease afflicting rice and there is an urgent need for the use of disease resistance (R) genes in blast tolerance breeding programs. Pb1 is classified as a quantitative resistance gene and it does not have fungal specificity. Pb1-mediated resistance develops in the latter stages of growth. However, some cultivars, such as Kanto209 (K209), cultivar name Satojiman, despite possessing Pb1, do not exert resistance to rice blast during the reproductive stage.

RESULTS: We found that the expression of WRKY45 gene downstream of Pb1 was weakly induced by rice blast inoculation at the full heading stage in K209. Genetic analysis using the SNP-based Golden Gate assay of K209 crossing with Koshihikari Aichi SBL (KASBL) found at least four regions related to the resistance in the rice genome (Chr8, Chr9, Chr7, Chr11). Mapping of QTL related to Chr7 confirmed the existence of factors that were required for the resistance of Pb1 in the 22 to 23 Mbp region of the rice genome.

CONCLUSION: We clarified how the K209 cultivar is vulnerable to the blast disease despite possessing Pb1 and found the DNA marker responsible for the quantitative resistance of Pb1. We identified the QTL loci required for Pb1-mediated resistance to rice panicle blast. Pb1 was negatively dependent on at least three QTLs, 7, 9 and 11, and positively dependent on one, QTL 8, in the K209 genome. This finding paves the way for creating a line to select optimal QTLs in order to make use of Pb1-mediated resistance more effectively.
28848592	New Genetic Loci Associated with Preharvest Sprouting and Its Evaluation Based on the Model Equation in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Preharvest sprouting (PHS) in rice panicles is an important quantitative trait that causes both yield losses and the deterioration of grain quality under unpredictable moisture conditions at the ripening stage. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PHS has not yet been elucidated. Here, we explored the genetic loci associated with PHS in rice and formulated a model regression equation for rapid screening for use in breeding programs. After re-sequencing 21 representative accessions for PHS and performing enrichment analysis, we found that approximately 20,000 SNPs revealed distinct allelic distributions between PHS resistant and susceptible accessions. Of these, 39 candidate SNP loci were selected, including previously reported QTLs. We analyzed the genotypes of 144 rice accessions to determine the association between PHS and the 39 candidate SNP loci, 10 of which were identified as significantly affecting PHS based on allele type. Based on the allele types of the SNP loci, we constructed a regression equation for evaluating PHS, accounting for an R2 value of 0.401 in japonica rice. We validated this equation using additional accessions, which exhibited a significant R2 value of 0.430 between the predicted values and actual measurements. The newly detected SNP loci and the model equation could facilitate marker-assisted selection to predict PHS in rice germplasm and breeding lines.
28677493	Dynamic Changes in the Rice Blast Population in the United States Over Six Decades.	2017	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. Field isolates of M. oryzae rapidly adapt to their hosts and climate. Tracking the genetic and pathogenic variability of field isolates is essential to understand how M. oryzae interacts with hosts and environments. In this study, a total of 1,022 United States field isolates collected from 1959 to 2015 were analyzed for pathogenicity toward eight international rice differentials. A subset of 457 isolates was genotyped with 10 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The average polymorphism information content value of markers was 0.55, suggesting that the SSR markers were highly informative to capture the population variances. Six genetic clusters were identified by both STRUCTURE and discriminant analysis of principal components methods. Overall, Nei's diversity of M. oryzae in the United States was 0.53, which is higher than previously reported in a world rice blast collection (0.19). The observed subdivision was associated with collection time periods but not with geographic origin of the isolates. Races such as IC-17, IE-1, and IB-49 have been identified across almost all collection periods and all clusters; races such as IA-1, IB-17, and IH-1 have a much higher frequency in certain periods and clusters. Both genomic and pathogenicity changes of United States blast isolates were associated with collection year, suggesting that hosts are a driving force for the genomic variability of rice blast fungus.
28805492	Roles of rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE1 (OsPIL1) in leaf senescence.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Rice (Oryza sativa) Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 (OsPIL1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays an important role in the elongation of internode cells. Recently, we found that OsPIL1 participates in chlorophyll biosynthesis by directly upregulating several genes encoding components of the photosystem apparatus. Here, we show that OsPIL1 negatively regulates leaf senescence in rice. During dark-induced senescence (DIS), ospil1 mutants senesced earlier than wild type; this is opposite to mutants of Arabidopsis PIF4 and PIF5, the closest homologs of OsPIL1. Microarray analysis revealed that during DIS, several senescence-associated genes were upregulated and OsGLKs, negative regulators of leaf senescence, were strongly repressed in ospil1 mutants. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPIL1 showed an early senescing phenotype during DIS. In addition, OsPIL1 expressed in Arabidopsis upregulates the transcription of ORESARA1, a major senescence-inducing NAC transcription factor and one of the downstream genes of Arabidopsis PIF4, by directly binding the promoter region. These results indicate that OsPIL1 and Arabidopsis PIF4 have similar functions, but their downstream regulatory cascades have opposite effects.
28841686	Functional properties of an alternative, tissue-specific promoter for rice NADPH-dependent dihydroflavonol reductase.	2017	PLoS One	NADPH-dependent dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) plays an important role in both anthocyanin biosynthesis and proanthocyanidin synthesis in plants. A specific and quantitative RT-PCR assay for transcription from the DFR promoter detected high expression with limited variability in rice tissues. A 440 bp minimal promoter region was identified by transfection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter constructs into Jeokjinju variety. Alignment of the region with orthologous promoters revealed three conserved segments containing both bHLH (-386 to -381) and Myb (-368 to -362) binding sites. Transfection of β-glucuronidase constructs with targeted point mutations in the minimal promoter defined two sites important for promoter function to the transcription factor binding consensus sequences. The expression study showed that the bHLH binding domain (-386 to -381) is essential for DFR expression, and that a Myb binding domain (-368 to -362) is also required for full expression of the DFR gene, while the two bHLH binding domains (-104 to -99 and -27 to -22) nearest to the transcriptional start site are not necessary for DFR expression.
28790353	Host Delivered RNAi, an efficient approach to increase rice resistance to sheath blight pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani).	2017	Sci Rep	Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of rice sheath blight disease, causes significant losses worldwide as there are no cultivars providing absolute resistance to this fungal pathogen. We have used Host Delivered RNA Interference (HD-RNAi) technology to target two PATHOGENICITY MAP KINASE 1 (PMK1) homologues, RPMK1-1 and RPMK1-2, from R. solani using a hybrid RNAi construct. PMK1 homologues in other fungal pathogens are essential for the formation of appressorium, the fungal infection structures required for penetration of the plant cuticle, as well as invasive growth once inside the plant tissues and overall viability of the pathogen within the plant. Evaluation of transgenic rice lines revealed a significant decrease in fungal infection levels compared to non-transformed controls and the observed delay in disease symptoms was further confirmed through microscopic studies. Relative expression levels of the targeted genes, RPMK1-1 and RPMK1-2, were determined in R. solani infecting either transgenic or control lines with significantly lower levels observed in R. solani infecting transgenic lines carrying the HD-RNAi constructs. This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of HD-RNAi against sheath blight and offers new opportunities for durable control of the disease as it does not rely on resistance conferred by major resistance genes.
28821745	Metabolomics and genomics combine to unravel the pathway for the presence of fragrance in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Since it was first characterised in 1983, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) has been considered to be the most important aroma compound in rice. In this study, we show four other amine heterocycles: 6-methyl, 5-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine (6M5OTP), 2-acetylpyrrole, pyrrole and 1-pyrroline, that correlate strongly with the production of 2AP, and are present in consistent proportions in a set of elite aromatic rice varieties from South East Asia and Australia as well as in a collection of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from indica Jasmine-type varieties, Australian long grain varieties (temperate japonica) and Basmati-type rice (Grp V). These compounds were detected through untargeted metabolite profiling by two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOF-MS), and their identity were confirmed by comparison with authentic standards analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and High Resolution GC × GC-TOF-MS (GC × GC HRT-4D). Genome-wide association analysis indicates that all compounds co-localised with a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) that harbours the FGR gene responsible for the production of GABA. Together, these data provide new insights into the production of 2AP, and evidence for understanding the pathway leading to the accumulation of aroma in fragrant rice.
28555318	Conformational Characteristics of Rice Hexokinase OsHXK7 as a Moonlighting Protein involved in Sugar Signalling and Metabolism.	2017	Protein J	Hexokinase (HXK) as a moonlighting protein involves in glucose metabolism and signalling to regulate growth and development in plants. Therefore, the clarification for the structural properties of OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 7) is essential to understand its role mechanism associated with the Glc signalling and metabolism. In this study, the structural characteristics of OsHXK7 (Oryza sativa Hexokinase 7) were identified. In the fluorescence spectrum, the Trp peak representing OsHXK7 binding to D-glucose (D-Glc) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-dG) showed an obvious blue shift. The distinct change in the secondary structure of OsHXK7 after binding to Glc was also detected in circular dichroism spectra. Using superimposed modelling, OsHXK7 showed a Glc-induced structural change, in which the 76th glycine, 148th serine and 256th tryptophan were contained within the pocket region. It was further shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the 76th glycine and the 256th tryptophan, but not the 148th serine, are the pivotal sites of OsHXK7 that maintain its catalytic activity and intrinsic blue shift fluorescence. These results suggest that OsHXK7 binding to Glc leads to a conformational change, that is likely essential for the function of OsHXK7 in Glc signalling and metabolism during plant growth and development.
28762002	Development of a bifunctional xylanase-cellulase chimera with enhanced activity on rice and barley straws using a modular xylanase and an endoglucanase procured from camel rumen metagenome.	2017	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The camel rumen metagenome is an untapped source of glycoside hydrolases. In this study, novel genes encoding for a modular xylanase (XylC) and a cellulase (CelC) were isolated from a camel rumen metagenome and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). XylC with xylanase (Xyn), CBM, and carbohydrate esterase (CE) domains was characterized as a β-1,4-endoxylanase with remarkable catalytic activity on oat-spelt xylan (K cat = 2919 ± 57 s-1). The implication of XylC's modular structure in its high catalytic activity was analyzed by truncation and fusion construction with CelC. The resulting fusions including Cel-CBM, Cel-CBM-CE, and Xyn-CBM-Cel showed remarkable enhancement in CMCase activity with K cat values of 742 ± 12, 1289 ± 34.5, and 2799 ± 51 s-1 compared to CelC with a K cat of 422 ± 3.5 s-1. It was also shown that the bifunctional Xyn-CBM-Cel with synergistic xylanase/cellulase activities was more efficient than XylC and CelC in hydrolysis of rice and barley straws.
28825710	Metals induce transient folding and activation of the twister ribozyme.	2017	Nat Chem Biol	Twister is a small ribozyme present in almost all kingdoms of life that rapidly self-cleaves in variety of divalent metal ions. We used activity assays, bulk FRET and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to understand how different metal ions promote folding and self-cleavage of the Oryza sativa twister ribozyme. Although most ribozymes require additional Mg2+ for catalysis, twister inverts this expectation, requiring 20-30 times less Mg2+ to self-cleave than to fold. Transition metals such as Co2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ activate twister more efficiently than Mg2+ ions. Although twister is fully active in ≤ 0.5 mM MgCl2, smFRET experiments showed that the ribozyme visits the folded state infrequently under these conditions. Comparison of folding and self-cleavage rates indicates that most folding events lead to catalysis, which correlates with metal bond strength. Thus, the robust activity of twister reports on transient metal ion binding under physiological conditions.
28637286	Structure-seq2: sensitive and accurate genome-wide profiling of RNA structure in vivo.	2017	Nucleic Acids Res	RNA serves many functions in biology such as splicing, temperature sensing, and innate immunity. These functions are often determined by the structure of RNA. There is thus a pressing need to understand RNA structure and how it changes during diverse biological processes both in vivo and genome-wide. Here, we present Structure-seq2, which provides nucleotide-resolution RNA structural information in vivo and genome-wide. This optimized version of our original Structure-seq method increases sensitivity by at least 4-fold and improves data quality by minimizing formation of a deleterious by-product, reducing ligation bias, and improving read coverage. We also present a variation of Structure-seq2 in which a biotinylated nucleotide is incorporated during reverse transcription, which greatly facilitates the protocol by eliminating two PAGE purification steps. We benchmark Structure-seq2 on both mRNA and rRNA structure in rice (Oryza sativa). We demonstrate that Structure-seq2 can lead to new biological insights. Our Structure-seq2 datasets uncover hidden breaks in chloroplast rRNA and identify a previously unreported N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in a nuclear-encoded Oryza sativa rRNA. Overall, Structure-seq2 is a rapid, sensitive, and unbiased method to probe RNA in vivo and genome-wide that facilitates new insights into RNA biology.
28789632	Catalytic and functional aspects of different isozymes of glycolate oxidase in rice.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme for photorespiration in plants. There are four GLO genes encoding and forming different isozymes in rice, but their functional differences are not well understood. In this study, enzymatic and physiological characteristics of the GLO isozymes were comparatively analyzed.

RESULTS: When expressed heterologously in yeast, GLO1, GLO4 and GLO1 + 4 showed the highest activities and lowest K m for glycolate as substrate, whereas GLO3 displayed high activities and affinities for both glycolate and L-lactate, and GLO5 was catalytically inactive with all substrates tested. To further reveal the physiological role of each GLO isozyme in plants, various GLO genetically modified rice lines were generated and functionally analyzed. GLO activity was significantly increased both in GLO1 and GLO4 overexpression lines. Nevertheless, when either GLO1 or GLO4 was knocked out, the activity was suppressed much more significantly in GLO1 knockout lines than in GLO4 knockout lines, and both knockout mutants exhibited obvious dwarfism phenotypes. Among GLO3 and GLO5 overexpression lines and RNAi lines, only GLO3 overexpression lines showed significantly increased L-lactate-oxidizing activity but no other noticeable phenotype changes.

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that rice GLO isozymes have distinct enzymatic characteristics, and they may have different physiological functions in rice.
28855911	Plant Glyoxylate/Succinic Semialdehyde Reductases: Comparative Biochemical Properties, Function during Chilling Stress, and Subcellular Localization.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Plant NADPH-dependent glyoxylate/succinic semialdehyde reductases 1 and 2 (cytosolic GLYR1 and plastidial/mitochondrial GLYR2) are considered to be of particular importance under abiotic stress conditions. Here, the apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) GLYR1s and GLYR2s were characterized and their kinetic properties were compared to those of previously characterized GLYRs from Arabidopsis thaliana [L.] Heynh. The purified recombinant GLYRs had an affinity for glyoxylate and succinic semialdehyde, respectively, in the low micromolar and millimolar ranges, and were inhibited by NADP+. Comparison of the GLYR activity in cell-free extracts from wild-type Arabidopsis and a glyr1 knockout mutant revealed that approximately 85 and 15% of the cellular GLYR activity is cytosolic and plastidial/mitochondrial, respectively. Recovery of GLYR activity in purified mitochondria from the Arabidopsis glyr1 mutant, free from cytosolic GLYR1 or plastidial GLYR2 contamination, provided additional support for the targeting of GLYR2 to mitochondria, as well as plastids. The growth of plantlets or roots of various Arabidopsis lines with altered GLYR activity responded differentially to succinic semialdehyde or glyoxylate under chilling conditions. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential regulation of highly conserved plant GLYRs by NADPH/NADP+ ratios in planta, and their roles in the reduction of toxic aldehydes in plants subjected to chilling stress.
28871266	Molecular Mapping of QTLs Associated with Lodging Resistance in Dry Direct-Seeded Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	Front Plant Sci	Dry direct-seeded rice (DSR) is an alternative crop establishment method with less water and labor requirement through mechanization. It provides better opportunities for a second crop during the cropping season and therefore, a feasible alternative system to transplanted lowland rice. However, lodging is one of the major constraints in attaining high yield in DSR. Identification of QTLs for lodging resistance and their subsequent use in improving varieties under DSR will be an efficient breeding strategy to address the problem. In order to map the QTLs associated with lodging resistance, a set of 253 BC3F4 lines derived from a backcross between Swarna and Moroberekan were evaluated in two consecutive years. A total of 12 QTLs associated with lodging resistance traits [culm length (qCL), culm diameter (qCD), and culm strength (qCS)] were mapped on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and 7 using 193 polymorphic SNP markers. Two major and consistent effect QTLs, namely qCD1.1 (with R2 of 10%) and qCS1.1 (with R2 of 14%) on chromosome 1 with id1003559 being the peak SNP marker (flanking markers; id1001973-id1006772) were identified as a common genomic region associated with important lodging resistance traits. In silico analysis revealed the presence of Gibberellic Acid 3 beta-hydroxylase along with 34 other putative candidate genes in the marker interval region of id1001973-id1006772. The positive alleles for culm length, culm diameter, and culm strength were contributed by the upland adaptive parent Moroberekan. Our results identified significant positive correlation between lodging related traits (culm length diameter and strength) and grain yield under DSR, indicating the role of lodging resistant traits in grain yield improvement under DSR. Deployment of the identified alleles influencing the culm strength and culm diameter in marker assisted introgression program may facilitate the lodging resistance under DSR.
28821860	GABA accretion reduces Lsi-1 and Lsi-2 gene expressions and modulates physiological responses in Oryza sativa to provide tolerance towards arsenic.	2017	Sci Rep	GABA counteracts wide range of stresses through regulation of GABA shunt pathway in plants. Although, GABA assisted tolerance against As toxicity in plants is still unexplored. We have examined GABA induced tolerance in rice seedlings with two exposure periods of GABA i.e., short term and long term. Results showed that accumulation of GABA reduced the expressions of Lsi-1 and Lsi-2 transporter genes, which ultimately decreased the accumulation of As in rice seedlings. The accumulation of GABA also modulated the gene expression of GABA shunt pathway and activity of antioxidant enzymes, which strongly induced the tolerance in plants. Antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, POD, GPX and SOD showed maximum alteration in activity with GABA accretion. In both exposure periods, long term accumulation of GABA was highly efficient to provide tolerance to plants against As(III), while higher level of GABA at short term was toxic. Tolerance responses of GABA towards As(III) was reflected by minimal changes in various physiological (WUE, A, gs, PhiPS2, qp, NPQ, ETR and Trmmol) and growth parameters with concomitant accumulation. Oxidative stress marker such as TBARS and H2O2 contents were reduced with GABA accumulation. These results suggested that GABA sturdily inhibits As accumulation and provides tolerance towards As(III).

28829777	The activation of OsEIL1 on YUC8 transcription and auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedling development.	2017	PLoS Genet	Rice is an important monocotyledonous crop worldwide; it differs from the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis in many aspects. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically to regulate root growth and development. However, their interaction in rice is still unclear. Here, we report that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of YUC activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), we showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. By screening phenotypes of seedling primary root from mutagenesis libraries following ethylene treatment, we identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YUC8/REIN7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while YUC8/REIN7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. Moreover, YUC8/REIN7 catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, truncated version at C-terminal end of the YUC8/REIN7 resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity, indicating that YUC8/REIN7 is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Further investigations indicated that ethylene induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1, strongly demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functioned downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activated the expression of YUC8/REIN7. Thus, our findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation, enhancing our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
28814283	Comparative studies on tolerance of rice genotypes differing in their tolerance to moderate salt stress.	2017	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Moderate salt stress, which often occurs in most saline agriculture land, suppresses crop growth and reduces crop yield. Rice, as an important food crop, is sensitive to salt stress and rice genotypes differ in their tolerance to salt stress. Despite extensive studies on salt tolerance of rice, a few studies have specifically investigated the mechanism by which rice plants respond and tolerate to moderate salt stress. Two rice genotypes differing in their tolerance to saline-alkaline stress, Dongdao-4 and Jigeng-88, were used to explore physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance to moderate salt stress.

RESULTS: Dongdao-4 plants displayed higher biomass, chlorophyll contents, and photosynthetic rates than Jigeng-88 under conditions of salt stress. No differences in K+ concentrations, Na+ concentrations and Na+/K+ ratio in shoots between Dongdao-4 and Jigeng-88 plants were detected when challenged by salt stress, suggesting that Na+ toxicity may not underpin the greater tolerance of Dongdao-4 to salt stress than that of Jigeng-88. We further demonstrated that Dongdao-4 plants had greater capacity to accumulate soluble sugars and proline (Pro) than Jigeng-88, thus conferring greater tolerance of Dongdao-4 to osmotic stress than Jigeng-88. Moreover, Dongdao-4 suffered from less oxidative stress than Jigeng-88 under salt stress due to higher activities of catalase (CAT) in Dongdao-4 seedlings. Finally, RNA-seq revealed that Dongdao-4 and Jigeng-88 differed in their gene expression in response to salt stress, such that salt stress changed expression of 456 and 740 genes in Dongdao-4 and Jigeng-88, respectively.

CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that Dongdao-4 plants were capable of tolerating to salt stress by enhanced accumulation of Pro and soluble sugars to tolerate osmotic stress, increasing the activities of CAT to minimize oxidative stress, while Na+ toxicity is not involved in the greater tolerance of Dongdao-4 to moderate salt stress.
28843032	Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Grasses display highly diversified inflorescence architectures that differ in the arrangement of spikelets and flowers and determine cereal yields. However, the molecular basis underlying grass inflorescence morphogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of a functionally diversified SEPALLATA MADS-box transcription factor, OsMADS34, in regulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence and spikelet development. Microarray analysis showed that, at the very early stages of inflorescence formation, dysfunction of OsMADS34 caused altered expression of 379 genes that are associated with protein modification and degradation, transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism activity. Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants. Additionally, double mutant between osmads34 and the sterile lemma defective mutant elongated empty glume (ele) displayed an enhanced phenotype, that is, longer and wider sterile lemmas that were converted into lemma/palea-like organs, suggesting that ELE and OsMADS34 synergistically control the sterile lemma development. OsMADS34 may act together with OsMADS15 in controlling sterile lemma development. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the regulatory function of OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet development.
28832544	Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of the GmSnRK2 Family in Soybean.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	Sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s) that were reported to be involved in the transduction of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, play important roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Compared to the systemic investigation of SnRK2s in Arabidopsisthaliana and Oryza sativa, little is known regarding SnRK2s in soybean, which is one of the most important oil and protein crops. In the present study, we performed genome-wide identification and characterization of GmSnRK2s in soybean. In summary, 22 GmSnRK2s were identified and clustered into four groups. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the expansion of SnRK2 gene family during the evolution of soybean. Various cis-acting elements such as ABA Response Elements (ABREs) were identified and analyzed in the promoter regions of GmSnRK2s. The results of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for different soybean tissues showed that GmSnRK2s exhibited spatio-temporally specific expression patterns during soybean growth and development. Certain GmSnRK2s could respond to the treatments including salinity, ABA and strigolactones. Our results provide a foundation for the further elucidation of the function of GmSnRK2 genes in soybean.
28853048	Dissecting combining ability effect in a rice NCII-III population provides insights into heterosis in indica-japonica cross.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Combining ability is a measure for selecting elite parents that make the highest contributions to hybrid performance. However, the genetic bases of combining ability and how they contributed to heterosis is seldomly known.

RESULTS: We constructed a both NCII and NCIII population derived from an indica-japonica cross to study the relationship among parental performance, combining ability and hybrid performance of 11 agronomic traits. Among them, specific combining ability is more important to grain yield than parental performance and general combining ability. We performed linkage analyses to phenotypic values and combining ability of all 11 traits in Doubled haploid lines and its two backcross populations and identified 108 QTLs in total. Among these QTLs, four known loci, Sd1, Ghd7, Ghd8 and DEP1 contribute a lot to GCA effects of agronomic traits except grain yield and seed setting rate. Three QTLs, Ghd8, S5 and qS12, contribute a lot to SCA effects of grain yield and present overdominace.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insights into the genetic bases of combining ability and heterosis and will promote the improvements of indica-japonica hybrid breeding.
28871269	A Chemical-Induced, Seed-Soaking Activation Procedure for Regulated Gene Expression in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	Inducible gene expression has emerged as a powerful tool for plant functional genomics. The estrogen receptor-based, chemical-inducible system XVE has been used in many plant species, but the limited systemic movement of inducer β-estradiol in transgenic rice plants has prohibited a wide use of the XVE system in this important food crop. Here, we constructed an improved chemical-regulated, site-specific recombination system by employing the XVE transactivator in combination with a Cre/loxP-FRT system, and optimized a seed-soaking procedure for XVE induction in rice. By using a gus gene and an hpRNAi cassette targeted for OsPDS as reporters, we demonstrated that soaking transgenic seeds with estradiol solution could induce highly efficient site-specific recombination in germinating embryos, resulting in constitutive and high-level expression of target gene or RNAi cassette in intact rice plants from induced seeds. The strategy reported here thereby provides a useful gene activation approach for effectively regulating gene expression in rice.
28857351	MAPK kinase 10.2 promotes disease resistance and drought tolerance by activating different MAPKs in rice.	2017	Plant J	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, with each cascade consisting of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and a MAPK, have important roles in different biological processes. However, the signal transduction in rice MAPK cascades remains to be elucidated. We show that the structural non-canonical MAPKK, MPKK10.2, enhances rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial streak disease, and increases rice tolerance to drought stress by phosphorylating and activating two MAPKs, MPK6 and MPK3, respectively. MPKK10.2-overexpressing (oe) plants showed enhanced resistance to both Xoc and drought, whereas MPKK10.2-RNA interference (RNAi) plants had increased sensitivity to both Xoc and drought. MPKK10.2 physically interacted with MPK6 and MPK3, and phosphorylated the two MAPKs in vivo. Transcriptionally modulating MPKK10.2 influenced MPK6 phosphorylation during rice-Xoc interaction, and MPKK10.2-oe/MPK6-RNAi double mutants showed increased sensitivity to Xoc. MPKK10.2-oe/MPK3-RNAi double mutants showed survival rates similar to those of control plants, although the survival rates of MPKK10.2 transgenic plants changed after drought stress. These results suggest that MPKK10.2 is a node involved in rice response to biotic and abiotic responses by functioning in the cross-point of two MAPK cascades leading to Xoc resistance and drought tolerance.
28842593	Bacterial Community Structure in the Asian Rice Gall Midge Reveals a Varied Microbiome Rich in Proteobacteria.	2017	Sci Rep	The Asian rice gall midge (ARGM) has emerged as a model gall forming pest of rice. The ARGM infestation of rice results in failure of panicle formation and economic loss. Understanding the molecular basis of ARGM-rice interactions is very crucial in order to control this devastating pest of rice. The current investigation was devised to identify bacterial communities present in the ARGM and in addition the bacterial diversity in the maggots during their interaction with susceptible or resistant rice varieties. Sequencing of 16S rRNA bacterial gene (V3-V4 region) revealed differences in the microflora of the ARGM maggots feeding on susceptible or resistant rice hosts. Results revealed that Wolbachia was the predominant bacterium in pupae and adults while Pseudomonas was predominant in maggots. Further, we observed that members of proteobacteria were predominant across all the samples. There was high species diversity in maggots isolated from susceptible rice and a high representation of unclassified bacteria in maggots isolated from resistant rice. This is the first study that reports variation of microbiome of the ARGM, based on host phenotype from which it was isolated, and results suggest that these variations could have an important role in host's susceptibility.
28835208	Whole genome sequencing and comparative transcriptome analysis of a novel seawater adapted, salt-resistant rice cultivar - sea rice 86.	2017	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa) is critical for human nutrition worldwide. Due to a growing population, cultivars that produce high yields in high salinity soil are of major importance. Here we describe the discovery and molecular characterization of a novel sea water adapted rice strain, Sea Rice 86 (SR86).

RESULTS: SR86 can produce nutritious grains when grown in high salinity soil. Compared to a salt resistant rice cultivar, Yanfen 47 (YF47), SR86 grows in environments with up to 3X the salt content, and produces grains with significantly higher nutrient content in 12 measured components, including 2.9X calcium and 20X dietary fiber. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that SR86 is a relatively ancient indica subspecies, phylogenetically close to the divergence point of the major rice varietals. SR86 has 12 chromosomes with a total genome size of 373,130,791 bps, slightly smaller than other sequenced rice genomes. Via comparison with 3000 rice genomes, we identified 42,359 putative unique, high impact variants in SR86. Transcriptome analysis of SR86 grown under normal and high saline conditions identified a large number of differentially expressed and salt-induced genes. Many of those genes fall into several gene families that have established or suggested roles in salt tolerance, while others represent potentially novel mediators of salt adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of SR86 has laid a foundation for further molecular characterization of several desirable traits in this novel rice cultivar. A number of candidate genes related to salt adaptation identified in this study will be valuable for further functional investigation.
28801586	Identification of mega-environments and rice genotypes for general and specific adaptation to saline and alkaline stresses in India.	2017	Sci Rep	In the present study, a total of 53 promising salt-tolerant genotypes were tested across 18 salt-affected diverse locations for three years. An attempt was made to identify ideal test locations and mega-environments using GGE biplot analysis. The CSSRI sodic environment was the most discriminating location in individual years as well as over the years and could be used to screen out unstable and salt-sensitive genotypes. Genotypes CSR36, CSR-2K-219, and CSR-2K-262 were found ideal across years. Overall, Genotypes CSR-2K-219, CSR-2K-262, and CSR-2K-242 were found superior and stable among all genotypes with higher mean yields. Different sets of genotypes emerged as winners in saline soils but not in sodic soils; however, Genotype CSR-2K-262 was the only genotype that was best under both saline and alkaline environments over the years. The lack of repeatable associations among locations and repeatable mega-environment groupings indicated the complexity of soil salinity. Hence, a multi-location and multi-year evaluation is indispensable for evaluating the test sites as well as identifying genotypes with consistently specific and wider adaptation to particular agro-climatic zones. The genotypes identified in the present study could be used for commercial cultivation across edaphically challenged areas for sustainable production.
28775653	Breeding drought tolerant rice for shallow rainfed ecosystem of eastern India.	2017	Field Crops Res	In shallow rainfed rice agro-ecosystems, drought stress can occur at any growth stage and can cause a significant yield reduction. During recent years, some rice varieties possessing tolerance of reproductive-stage drought stress have recently been developed. Tolerance of vegetative-stage drought stress is also required to improve rice productivity in drought-prone regions. In this study, we evaluated a set of rice breeding lines for their response to a range of different types of vegetative-stage drought stress in order to propose standardized phenotyping protocols for conducting vegetative-stage drought stress screening trials and also to identify genotypes combining tolerance of vegetative- and reproductive-stage drought stress. A soil water potential threshold of -20 kPa during the vegetative stage was identified as the target for effective selection under vegetative stage with grain yield reduction of about 50% compared to irrigated control trials. Genotypes identified as showing high yield under reproductive-stage drought stress were not necessarily the genotypes showing best performance under vegetative-stage drought stress. Genotypes IR72667-16-1-B-B-3, IR78908-126-B-2-B, and IR79970-B-47-1 showed tolerance of both vegetative-stage and reproductive-stage drought stress. For most, the genotypes that were best under vegetative stage drought or even vegetative stage + reproductive stage drought were different from the genotypes that were best under reproductive stage drought. Based on the cultivar superiority measure, IR69515-6-KKN-4-UBN-4-2-1-1-1 and IR78908-126-B-1-B were the stable genotypes (indicated by low Pi ) under both irrigated control and severe vegetative stress conditions, genotypes IR83614-203-B and IR78908-80-B-3-B were stable under irrigated control conditions and moderate stress, whereas IR72667-16-1-B-B-3 was stable under both moderate and severe vegetative-stage stress conditions.
28805500	Chitin receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinases and ROS production in rice and Arabidopsis.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Rapid induction of plant immune responses is essential to inhibit colonization and invasion by pathogens. Plants can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including fungal chitin and bacterial flagellin using pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which trigger the intracellular activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). MAPK activation and ROS production play pivotal roles in the induction of robust immune responses. Recent investigation of chitin- and flagellin-induced immune signaling revealed that receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) connect PRR-mediated pathogen recognition to MAPK activation and ROS production. In addition, although the MAPK cascade is mediated by 3 sequentially activated protein kinases, MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK, how MAPKKKs are activated downstream of PRRs in plants has not been identified until recently. In this review, we summarize recent findings of RLCK-mediated MAPK activation and ROS production in rice and Arabidopsis.
28779340	Identification of resistant germplasm containing novel resistance genes at or tightly linked to the Pi2/9 locus conferring broad-spectrum resistance against rice blast.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: The rice Pi2/9 locus harbors multiple resistance (R) genes each controlling broad-spectrum resistance against diverse isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae, a fungal pathogen causing devastating blast disease to rice. Identification of more resistance germplasm containing novel R genes at or tightly linked to the Pi2/9 locus would promote breeding of resistance rice cultivars.

RESULTS: In this study, we aim to identify resistant germplasm containing novel R genes at or tightly linked to the Pi2/9 locus using a molecular marker, designated as Pi2/9-RH (Pi2/9 resistant haplotype), developed from the 5' portion of the Pi2 sequence which was conserved only in the rice lines containing functional Pi2/9 alleles. DNA analysis using Pi2/9-RH identified 24 positive lines in 55 shortlisted landraces which showed resistance to 4 rice blast isolates. Analysis of partial sequences of the full-length cDNAs of Pi2/9 homologues resulted in the clustering of these 24 lines into 5 haplotypes each containing different Pi2/9 homologues which were designated as Pi2/9-A5, -A15, -A42, -A53, and -A54. Interestingly, Pi2/9-A5 and Pi2/9-A54 are identical to Piz-t and Pi2, respectively. To validate the association of other three novel Pi2/9 homologues with the blast resistance, monogenic lines at BC3F3 generation were generated by marker assisted backcrossing (MABC). Resistance assessment of the derived monogenic lines in both the greenhouse and the field hotspot indicated that they all controlled broad-spectrum resistance against rice blast. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that the blast resistance of these three monogenic lines was co-segregated with Pi2/9-RH, suggesting that the Pi2/9 locus or tightly linked loci could be responsible for the resistance.

CONCLUSION: The newly developed marker Pi2/9-RH could be used as a potentially diagnostic marker for the quick identification of resistant donors containing functional Pi2/9 alleles or unknown linked R genes. The three new monogenic lines containing the Pi2/9 introgression segment could be used as valuable materials for disease assessment and resistance donors in breeding program.
28797959	C-terminal residues of rice translin are essential for octamer formation and nucleic acid binding.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	Translin is a DNA/RNA binding protein involved in DNA repair and RNA metabolism. Previously, we had shown that rice translin (221 amino acids) exhibits biochemical activities similar to that of the human translin protein. Here we report the role of the C-terminal random coil in rice translin function by analyzing truncation (after 215th residue, Tra - 215) and substitution mutant proteins (Ser216Ala, Lys217Ala, Gln218Ala, Glu219Ala). Circular Dichroism (CD) analysis of Tra-215 showed deviations in comparison to Tra-WT. Truncation abolished the DNA binding activity and octamer formation as evidenced by the absence of ring like structures from TEM analysis. CD analysis of the substitution mutant proteins showed that the secondary structure was maintained in all the mutant proteins in comparison to wild type protein. Native PAGE and TEM analysis of the substitution mutants showed that Lys217Ala mutation completely abolished the octamer formation as rings and nucleic acid binding. Glu219Ala mutation also affected oligomerization but exhibited marginal RNA binding at higher protein concentrations and interestingly, failed to bind to DNA. However, Ser216Ala and Gln218Ala substitutions did not affect above mentioned activities of translin. Our results indicate that the C-terminal residues are one of the determinants of octamer formation in rice translin, with lysine at 217th position being the most important. Therefore, in conclusion, although the C-terminal residues do not form any defined secondary structure in the translin monomer, they are definitely involved in octamer formation and hence important for its molecular function. We have attempted to find the critical residues in translin function, which will advance our understanding of translin in DNA repair process in general and of rice translin in particular.
28811584	Nanopriming technology for enhancing germination and starch metabolism of aged rice seeds using phytosynthesized silver nanoparticles.	2017	Sci Rep	Application of nanomaterials for agriculture is relatively new as compared to their use in biomedical and industrial sectors. In order to promote sustainable nanoagriculture, biocompatible silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been synthesized through green route using kaffir lime leaf extract for use as nanopriming agent for enhancing seed germination of rice aged seeds. Results of various characterization techniques showed the successful formation of AgNPs which were capped with phytochemicals present in the plant extract. Rice aged seeds primed with phytosynthesized AgNPs at 5 and 10 ppm significantly improved germination performance and seedling vigor compared to unprimed control, AgNO3 priming, and conventional hydropriming. Nanopriming could enhance α-amylase activity, resulting in higher soluble sugar content for supporting seedlings growth. Furthermore, nanopriming stimulated the up-regulation of aquaporin genes in germinating seeds. Meanwhile, more ROS production was observed in germinating seeds of nanopriming treatment compared to unprimed control and other priming treatments, suggesting that both ROS and aquaporins play important roles in enhancing seed germination. Different mechanisms underlying nanopriming-induced seed germination were proposed, including creation of nanopores for enhanced water uptake, rebooting ROS/antioxidant systems in seeds, generation of hydroxyl radicals for cell wall loosening, and nanocatalyst for fastening starch hydrolysis.
28850869	Influence of bacterial strains on Oryza sativa grown under arsenic tainted soil: Accumulation and detoxification response.	2017	Plant Physiol Biochem	The present study was conducted to study the role of bacterial inoculants in growth, accumulation and tolerance responses in rice grown in arsenic (As) contaminated soil. Results revealed that out of five isolated bacterial strains, strain BBAU/MMM1 (Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University/Mari Matamandir) exhibited resistant to As(III) to the level of 400 μM As(III) in comparison to other strain which showed toxicity. The isolated strain BBAU/MMM1 1was characterized as gram negative, rod shape, showed positive test nitrate, citrate, catalase and phosphate solubilization with high production of IAA and siderophore. Arsenic treated rice seedlings supplemented with bacterial inoculants BBAU/MMM1 showed increased growth characteristics viz., root length (35.41%), shoot length (32.8%) and fresh weight (30.31%) in comparison to rice treated with As(III) only. In addition, reduced lipid peroxidation and induces cysteine, GSH (reduced glutathione), GSSG (Oxidized glutathione) and antioxidant enzymatic activities were also observed in bacterial supplemented rice seedlings. Further, reduced metal accumulation in root (1351.46-968.67 μg g-1fw), shoot (488.01-378.02 μg g-1fw) and reduced translocation factor (0.583-0.390) in As(III) treated rice seedlings inoculated with bacterial strains clearly reflect protective response of bacterial strain against As toxicity. Thus, isolated bacterial strain could be used as bioremediator as well as growth inducer in paddy field contaminated with arsenic.
28793366	Cadmium-induced melatonin synthesis in rice requires light, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide: Key regulatory roles for tryptophan decarboxylase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase.	2017	J Pineal Res	In plants, melatonin production is induced by stimuli such as cold and drought, and cadmium (Cd) is the best elicitor of melatonin production in rice. However, the mechanism by which Cd induces melatonin synthesis in plants remains unknown. We challenged rice seedlings with Cd under different light conditions and found that continuous light produced the highest levels of melatonin, while continuous dark failed to induce melatonin production. Transcriptional and translational induction of tryptophan decarboxylase contributed to the light induction of melatonin during Cd treatment, whereas the protein level of light-induced caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) was decreased by Cd treatment. In analogy, COMT enzyme activity was inhibited in vitro by Cd in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the Cd-induced melatonin synthesis was significantly impaired by treatment with either an H2 O2 production inhibitor (DPI) or an NO scavenger (cPTIO). The combination of both inhibitors almost completely abolished Cd-induced melatonin synthesis, suggesting an absolute requirement for H2 O2 and NO. However, neither serotonin nor N-acetylserotonin (NAS) was induced by H2 O2 alone. In contrast, NO significantly induced serotonin production but not NAS or melatonin production. This indicated that serotonin did not enter chloroplasts, where serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) is constitutively expressed. This suggests that chloroplastidic SNAT expression prevents increased melatonin production after exposure to stress, ultimately leading to the maintenance of a steady-state melatonin level inside cells.
28787541	Identification and molecular mapping of indica high-tillering dwarf mutant htd4, a mild phenotype allelic mutant of D14 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Metabolism of strigolactones (SLs) can improve the efficiency of nutrient use by regulating the development of roots and shoots in crops, making them an important research focus for molecular breeding. However, as a very important plant hormone, the molecular mechanism of SL signal transduction still remains largely unknown. In this study, we isolated an indica high-tillering dwarf mutant 4 (htd4), a spontaneous mutant of rice, from the restorer line Gui99. Mapping and sequencing analysis showed that htd4 was a novel allelic mutant of D14, in which a single base substitution forms a premature termination codon. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that expression levels of the genes D10, D17, D27, D3 and D14 increased significantly, while expression of D53 decreased in htd4, compared with the wild type. A subcellular localisation assay showed that the mutant of D14 in htd4 did not disturb the normal localisation of D14 proteins. However, a BiFC assay suggested that the mutant-type D14 could not interact with D3. Additionally, compared with other D14 allelic mutants, htd4 was the first mutant of D14 discovered in indica, and the differences in many yield traits such as plant height, seed-setting rate and grain sizes between htd4 and the wild type were less than those between other D14 allelic mutants and the wild type. Therefore, htd4 is considered a mild phenotype allelic mutant of D14. We conclude that the absence of functional D14 caused the high-tillering dwarf phenotype of htd4. Our results may provide vital information for research on D14 function and the application of htd4 in molecular breeding.
28829772	Correction: OVATE Family Protein 8 Positively Mediates Brassinosteroid Signaling through Interacting with the GSK3-like Kinase in Rice.	2017	PLoS Genet	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006118.].
28794433	Genome-wide dissection of heterosis for yield traits in two-line hybrid rice populations.	2017	Sci Rep	Heterosis has been widely utilized in agriculture and is important for world food safety. Many genetic models have been proposed as mechanisms underlying heterosis during the past century, yet more evidence is needed to support such models. To investigate heterosis in two-line hybrid rice, we generated a partial diallel crossing scheme, which consisted of approximately 500 F1 hybrids derived from 14 male sterile lines and 39 restorer lines. In this population, increased panicle number played the most important role in yield heterosis of hybrid rice. Genome-wide association studies identified many QTLs related to the yield traits of F1 hybrids, better paternal heterosis and special combining ability. Relevant genes, including Hd3a, qGL3, OsmiR156h, and LAX2, were identified as candidates within these QTLs. Nearly forty percent of the QTLs had only two genotypes in the F1 hybrids, mainly because the maternal lines were under intense selective pressure. Further analysis found male sterile lines and restorer lines made different superior allele contributions to F1 hybrids, and their contributions varied among different traits. These results extend our understanding of the molecular basis of heterosis in two-line hybrid rice.
28592558	Duplication and Loss of Function of Genes Encoding RNA Polymerase III Subunit C4 Causes Hybrid Incompatibility in Rice.	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Reproductive barriers are commonly observed in both animals and plants, in which they maintain species integrity and contribute to speciation. This report shows that a combination of loss-of-function alleles at two duplicated loci, DUPLICATED GAMETOPHYTIC STERILITY 1 (DGS1) on chromosome 4 and DGS2 on chromosome 7, causes pollen sterility in hybrid progeny derived from an interspecific cross between cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and an Asian annual wild rice, O. nivara Male gametes carrying the DGS1 allele from O. nivara (DGS1-nivaras ) and the DGS2 allele from O. sativa (DGS2-T65s ) were sterile, but female gametes carrying the same genotype were fertile. We isolated the causal gene, which encodes a protein homologous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) III subunit C4 (RPC4). RPC4 facilitates the transcription of 5S rRNAs and tRNAs. The loss-of-function alleles at DGS1-nivaras and DGS2-T65s were caused by weak or nonexpression of RPC4 and an absence of RPC4, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that gene duplication of RPC4 at DGS1 and DGS2 was a recent event that occurred after divergence of the ancestral population of Oryza from other Poaceae or during diversification of AA-genome species.
28856618	Large-scale deployment of a rice 6 K SNP array for genetics and breeding applications.	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Fixed arrays of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have advantages over reduced representation sequencing in their ease of data analysis, consistently higher call rates, and rapid turnaround times. A 6 K SNP array represents a cost-benefit "sweet spot" for routine genetics and breeding applications in rice. Selection of informative SNPs across species and subpopulations during chip design is essential to obtain useful polymorphism rates for target germplasm groups. This paper summarizes results from large-scale deployment of an Illumina 6 K SNP array for rice.

RESULTS: Design of the Illumina Infinium 6 K SNP chip for rice, referred to as the Cornell_6K_Array_Infinium_Rice (C6AIR), includes 4429 SNPs from re-sequencing data and 1571 SNP markers from previous BeadXpress 384-SNP sets, selected based on polymorphism rate and allele frequency within and between target germplasm groups. Of the 6000 attempted bead types, 5274 passed Illumina's production quality control. The C6AIR was widely deployed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) for genetic diversity analysis, QTL mapping, and tracking introgressions and was intensively used at Cornell University for QTL analysis and developing libraries of interspecific chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) between O. sativa and diverse accessions of O. rufipogon or O. meridionalis. Collectively, the array was used to genotype over 40,000 rice samples. A set of 4606 SNP markers was used to provide high quality data for O. sativa germplasm, while a slightly expanded set of 4940 SNPs was used for O. sativa X O. rufipogon populations. Biparental polymorphism rates were generally between 1900 and 2500 well-distributed SNP markers for indica x japonica or interspecific populations and between 1300 and 1500 markers for crosses within indica, while polymorphism rates were lower for pairwise crosses within U.S. tropical japonica germplasm. Recently, a second-generation array containing ~7000 SNP markers, referred to as the C7AIR, was designed by removing poor-performing SNPs from the C6AIR and adding markers selected to increase the utility of the array for elite tropical japonica material.

CONCLUSIONS: The C6AIR has been successfully used to generate rapid and high-quality genotype data for diverse genetics and breeding applications in rice, and provides the basis for an optimized design in the C7AIR.
28821824	Identification and analysis of brown planthopper-responsive microRNAs in resistant and susceptible rice plants.	2017	Sci Rep	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating insect pest of rice. The rice gene BPH15 confers resistance to BPH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a spectrum of development and defense response processes in plants. In this study, we analyzed six miRNA profiles of a BPH15 introgression line (P15) and a susceptible recipient line (PC) at three time points (0 h, 6 h and 48 h) after BPH attack, and identified 464 known miRNAs and 183 potential novel miRNAs. Before the BPH feeding, we identified 23 miRNAs differentially expressed in P15 and PC. We speculated that the resistant plant is in a priming state by the regulation of miRNAs. After the BPH feeding, 104 miRNAs were found to be expressed differentially in P15 (68 in P15-6/P15-0, 36 in P15-48/P15-0), and 80 miRNAs were found expressed differentially in PC (32 in PC-6/PC-0, 48 in PC-48/PC-0), which illustrated that miRNA expression is activated upon attack. These miRNAs regulate different pathways that contribute to the basal defense and specific resistance of rice to the BPH. Our study provides additional data for scientists to further explore the mechanism of plant defense against insect attack and to find a way for efficient insect control.
28832496	iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomics Analysis on Rice Anther Responding to High Temperature.	2017	Int J Mol Sci	As one of the most important crops, rice provides the major food for more than half of the world population. However, its production is limited by many environmental factors, among which high temperature stress (HS) frequently occurs during anthesis and reduces its spikelet fertility. To explore the mechanism of HS tolerance in rice, we conducted a comparative proteomics analysis on the anthers between HS resistant and sensitive cultivars under different levels of high temperature. Under the same HS treatment, the resistant cultivar showed much higher spikelet fertility than the sensitive cultivar. Proteomic data showed that HS lead to the degradation of ribosomal proteins in the sensitive cultivar but not in the resistant one, which might result in the injury of protein biosynthetic machinery. In contrast, HS induced the increase of sHSP, β-expansins and lipid transfer proteins in the resistant cultivar, which might contribute to its ability to tolerate HS. The results provide some new insights into the mechanism of rice HS response.
28830338	A major QTL on chromosome 7HS controls the response of barley seedling to salt stress in the Nure × Tremois population.	2017	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Seedling establishment is a crucial and vulnerable stage in the crop life cycle which determines further plant growth. While many studies are available on salt tolerance at the vegetative stage, the mechanisms and genetic bases of salt tolerance during seedling establishment have been poorly investigated. Here, a novel and accurate phenotyping protocol was applied to characterize the response of seedlings to salt stress in two barley cultivars (Nure and Tremois) and their double-haploid population.

RESULTS: The combined phenotypic data and existing genetic map led to the identification of a new major QTL for root elongation under salt stress on chromosome 7HS, with the parent Nure carrying the favourable allele. Gene-based markers were developed from the rice syntenic genomic region to restrict the QTL interval to Bin2.1 of barley chromosome 7HS. Furthermore, doubled haploid lines with contrasting responses to salt stress revealed different root morphological responses to stress, with the susceptible genotypes exhibiting an overall reduction in root length and volume but an increase in root diameter and root hair density.

CONCLUSIONS: Salt tolerance at the seedling stage was studied in barley through a comprehensive phenotyping protocol that allowed the detection of a new major QTL on chromosome 7HS.
28798310	Assessing the effects of Cry1C rice and Cry2A rice to Pseudogonatopus flavifemur, a parasitoid of rice planthoppers.	2017	Sci Rep	Transgenic rice producing insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) could help protect the plants from damage by lepidopteran pests. However, one concern is the potential of Bt rice to harm non-target natural enemies, which play a vital role in pest control. In the present study, the potential effects of Cry1C rice and Cry2A rice on different life-table parameters and population dynamics of Pseudogonatopus flavifemur, a parasitoid of rice planthoppers, were evaluated under laboratory and field condition. The exposure of P. flavifemur to plant-produced Bt proteins was also analyzed. Results indicated that direct feeding on rice plants was the main exposure pathway of P. flavifemur to the Cry1C and Cry2A proteins. No significant difference on the development, survival, longevity, fecundity, and prey consumption of P. flavifemur was detected over two generations between the Bt and non-Bt rice treatments. Furthermore, the population dynamics of P. flavifemur were not affected by Cry1C rice and Cry2A rice. In conclusion, the tested Cry1C rice and Cry2A rice do not appear to harm the parasitoid P. flavifemur.
28811335	The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice.	2017	Plant Physiol	Maize (Zea mays) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (Oryza sativa) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of ZmINCW1, a homolog of rice GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1 that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. ZmINCW1 is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homozygous mutant line in the AtcwINV2 gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of ZmINCW1). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.
28817683	Genome wide association analysis of cold tolerance at germination in temperate japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties.	2017	PLoS One	A pool of 200 traditional, landraces and modern elite and old cultivars of rice, mainly japonica varieties adapted to temperate regions, have been used to perform a genome wide association study to detect chromosome regions associated to low temperature germination (LTG) regulation using a panel of 1672 SNP markers. Phenotyping was performed by determining growth rates when seeds were germinated at 25° and 15°C in order to separate the germination vigorousness from cold tolerance effects. As expected, the ability to produce viable seedlings varied widely among rice cultivars and also depended greatly on temperature. Furthermore, we observed a differential response during seed germination and in coleoptile elongation. Faster development at 15°C was observed in seeds from varieties traditionally used as cold tolerant parents by breeders, along with other potentially useful cultivars, mainly of Italian origin. When phenotypic data were combined with the panel of SNPs for japonica rice cultivars, significant associations were detected for 31 markers: 7 were related to growth rate at 25°C and 24 to growth rates at 15°. Among the latter, some chromosome regions were associated to LTG while others were related to coleoptile elongation. Individual effects of the associated markers were low, but by combining favourable alleles in a linear regression model we estimated that 27 loci significantly explained the observed phenotypic variation. From these, a core panel of 13 markers was selected and, furthermore, two wide regions of chromosomes 3 and 6 were consistently associated to rice LTG. Varieties with higher numbers of favourable alleles for the panels of associated markers significantly correlated with increased phenotypic values at both temperatures, thus corroborating the utility of the tagged markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) when breeding japonica rice for LTG.
28861748	Physiological and molecular responses of seedlings of an upland rice ('Tung Lu 3') to total submergence compared to those of a submergence-tolerant lowland rice ('FR13A').	2017	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Understanding the responses of rice to environmental stresses such as unscheduled submergence is of pressing important owing to increasing severity of weather thought to arise from global climate change. When rice is completely submerged, different types adopt either a quiescence survival strategy (i.e., minimal shoot elongation) or an escape strategy (i.e., enhanced shoot elongation). Each strategy can prolong survival depending on the circumstances. While submergence responses have been studied in rice typical of lowland and flood-prone areas, few studies have explored the physiological and molecular properties of upland rice under submergence. Here, we use seedlings of the upland rice 'Tung Lu 3' ('TL3') to analyze physiological and molecular responses to submergence. We compare them with those of 'FR13A', a lowland rice that tolerates submergence by adopting the quiescence strategy.

RESULTS: Plant height and distance between leaf sheaths, increased rapidly in 'TL3' under submergence. Although this indicated a strong escape strategy the seedlings remained totally underwater for the duration of the experiments. In contrast, 'FR13A' elongated much less. Consequently, after 4 days complete submergence followed by drainage, 'TL3' lodged much more severely than 'FR13A'. After 10 d complete submergence, 55% of 'TL3' seedlings survived compared to 100% in 'FR13A'. Chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll concentrations of the 2nd oldest leaves of 'TL3' were also significantly above those of 'FR13A' (but were lower than 'FR13A' in the 3rd oldest leaves) and less hydrogen peroxide accumulated in 'TL3'. Peroxidase activity in submerged 'TL3' was also greater than in 'FR13A' 1 day after submergence. Quantitative RT-PCR showed increased expression of sucrose synthase 1 and alcohol dehydrogenases 1 after 2 days complete submergence with significantly higher levels in 'TL3' compared to 'FR13A'. Expression was also higher in 'TL3' under non-submerged conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: The upland rice line 'TL3' gave a stronger elongation response than 'FR13A' to complete submergence. This escape strategy is widely considered to prejudice survival when the plant remains totally submerged. However, contrary to expectations, 'TL3' survival rates were substantial although below those for 'FR13A' while physiological, biochemical and molecular parameters linked to adaptation differed in detail but appeared to be broadly comparable. These findings highlight that submergence tolerance is determine not only by the adoption of quiescence or escape strategies but maybe by metabolic and physiological properties unrelated to the underwater elongation rate.
28785094	MicroCT reveals domesticated rice (Oryza sativa) within pottery sherds from early Neolithic sites (4150-3265 cal BP) in Southeast Asia.	2017	Sci Rep	Rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated in the Yangtze Valley region at least 6000-8000 years ago, yet the timing of dispersal of domesticated rice to Southeast Asia is contentious. Often rice is not well-preserved in archaeobotanical assemblages at early Neolithic sites in the wet tropics of Southeast Asia and consequently rice impressions in pottery have been used as a proxy for rice cultivation despite their uncertain taxonomic and domestication status. In this research, we use microCT technology to determine the 3D microscale morphology of rice husk and spikelet base inclusions within pottery sherds from early Neolithic sites in Vietnam. In contrast to surface impressions, microCT provides images of the entire husk and spikelet base preserved within the pottery, including the abscission scar characteristic of domesticated rice. This research demonstrates the potential of microCT to be a new, non-destructive method for the identification of domesticated plant remains within pottery sherds, especially in contexts where archaeobotanical preservation is poor and chaff-tempered sherds are rare and unavailable for destructive analysis. The method has the potential to greatly advance the understanding of crop domestication and agricultural dispersal for ceramic cultures in different parts of the world.
28861807	Oral Secretions Affect HIPVs Induced by Generalist (Mythimna loreyi) and Specialist (Parnara guttata) Herbivores in Rice.	2017	J Chem Ecol	Plants synthesize variable mixtures of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as part of their evolutionary conserved defense. To elucidate the impact of chewing herbivores with different level of adaptation on HIPV profiles in rice, we measured HIPVs released from rice seedlings challenged by either the generalist herbivore Mythimna loreyi (MYL) or the specialist Parnara guttata (PAG). Both herbivores markedly elicited the emission of HIPVs, mainly on the second and third days after attack compared to control plants. In addition, side-by-side HIPV comparisons using MYL and PAG caterpillars revealed that generalist feeding induced comparably more HIPVs relative to specialist, particularly on day two as highlighted by multivariate analysis (PLS-DA) of emitted HIPVs, and further confirmed in mimicked herbivory experiments. Here, mechanically wounded plants treated with water (WW) released more VOCs than untreated controls, and on top of this, oral secretions (OS) from both herbivores showed differential effects on volatile emissions from the wounded plants. Similar to actual herbivory, MYL OS promoted higher amounts of HIPVs relative to PAG OS, thus supporting disparate induction of rice indirect defenses in response to generalist and specialist herbivores, which could be due to the differential composition of their OS.

28801742	The cyclic lipopeptide orfamide induces systemic resistance in rice to Cochliobolus miyabeanus but not to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2017	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: The Pseudomonas- derived cyclic lipopeptide orfamide can induce resistance to Cochliobolus miyabeanus but not to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice. Abscisic acid signaling is involved in the induced systemic resistance response triggered by orfamide. Diverse natural products produced by beneficial Pseudomonas species have the potential to trigger induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants, and thus may contribute to control of diseases in crops. Some beneficial Pseudomonas spp. can produce cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs), amphiphilic molecules composed of a fatty acid tail linked to an oligopeptide which is cyclized. CLPs can have versatile biological functions, but the capacity of Pseudomonas-derived CLPs in triggering ISR responses has barely been studied. Pseudomonas protegens and related species can produce orfamide-type CLPs. Here we show that in rice, orfamides can act as ISR elicitors against the necrotrophic fungus Cochliobolus miyabeanus, the causal agent of brown spot disease, but are not active against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Orfamide A can trigger early defensive events and activate transcripts of defense-related genes in rice cell suspension cultures, but does not cause cell death. Further testing in rice cell suspension cultures and rice plants showed that abscisic acid signaling, the transcriptional activator OsWRKY4 and pathogenesis-related protein PR1b are triggered by orfamide A and may play a role in the ISR response against C. miyabeanus.
28592557	Comparative Mapping of Seed Dormancy Loci Between Tropical and Temperate Ecotypes of Weedy Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).	2017	G3 (Bethesda)	Genotypic variation at multiple loci for seed dormancy (SD) contributes to plant adaptation to diverse ecosystems. Weedy rice (Oryza sativa) was used as a model to address the similarity of SD genes between distinct ecotypes. A total of 12 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SD were identified in one primary and two advanced backcross (BC) populations derived from a temperate ecotype of weedy rice (34.3°N Lat.). Nine (75%) of the 12 loci were mapped to the same positions as those identified from a tropical ecotype of weedy rice (7.1°N Lat.). The high similarity suggested that the majority of SD genes were conserved during the ecotype differentiation. These common loci are largely those collocated/linked with the awn, hull color, pericarp color, or plant height loci. Phenotypic correlations observed in the populations support the notion that indirect selections for the wild-type morphological characteristics, together with direct selections for germination time, were major factors influencing allelic distributions of SD genes across ecotypes. Indirect selections for crop-mimic traits (e.g., plant height and flowering time) could also alter allelic frequencies for some SD genes in agroecosystems. In addition, 3 of the 12 loci were collocated with segregation distortion loci, indicating that some gametophyte development genes could also influence the genetic equilibria of SD loci in hybrid populations. The SD genes with a major effect on germination across ecotypes could be used as silencing targets to develop transgene mitigation (TM) strategies to reduce the risk of gene flow from genetically modified crops into weed/wild relatives.
28834651	Gene flow from single and stacked herbicide-resistant rice (Oryza sativa): modeling occurrence of multiple herbicide-resistant weedy rice.	2017	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Provisia™ rice (PV), a non-genetically engineered (GE) quizalofop-resistant rice, will provide growers with an additional option for weed management to use in conjunction with Clearfield® rice (CL) production. Modeling compared the impact of stacking resistance traits versus single traits in rice on introgression of the resistance trait to weedy rice (also called red rice). Common weed management practices were applied to 2-, 3- and 4-year crop rotations, and resistant and multiple-resistant weedy rice seeds, seedlings and mature plants were tracked for 15 years.

RESULTS: Two-year crop rotations resulted in resistant weedy rice after 2 years with abundant populations (exceeding 0.4 weedy rice plants m-2 ) occurring after 7 years. When stacked trait rice was rotated with soybeans in a 3-year rotation and with soybeans and CL in a 4-year rotation, multiple-resistance occurred after 2-5 years with abundant populations present in 4-9 years. When CL rice, PV rice, and soybeans were used in 3- and 4-year rotations, the median time of first appearance of multiple-resistance was 7-11 years and reached abundant levels in 10-15 years.

CONCLUSION: Maintaining separate CL and PV rice systems, in rotation with other crops and herbicides, minimized the evolution of multiple herbicide-resistant weedy rice through gene flow compared to stacking herbicide resistance traits. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.
28779704	Seed priming with Se alleviate As induced phytotoxicity during germination and seedling growth by restricting As translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L c.v. IET-4094).	2017	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Interactive aspect of among selenium (Se) and As (As) to mitigate As induced phytotoxicity in rice during germination and seedling growth has been based on mostly to petriplates and hydroponic mode of experiments. In this investigation we explore the consequences of sowing Se primed rice seeds in As spiked soil. Unprimed, hydroprimed and Se primed rice (IET-4094) seeds sown in As spiked soil, with five replications, arranged in complete randomized design for evaluating the impacts of seed priming on germination and seedling growth as well as As uptake and translocation pattern. Se promotes germination, seedling growth by modulating proline content, lipid peroxidation in root and shoot beside enhancing total chlorophyll content significantly in both As free and As spiked soil as compared to their respective unprimed and hydroprimed counterparts grown alike. Findings also indicates that seed priming with Se was able to execute dual roles i.e. a promotive and antagonistic aspect against As by restricting maximum soil As load to the root (with greater bioconcentration factor) and reducing translocation of As from root to shoot in a more practical and farmer friendly way to mitigate As induced toxicity and enhance germination and growth in rice seedlings.
28847366	Regulation of rice root development by a retrotransposon acting as a microRNA sponge.	2017	Elife	It is well documented that transposable elements (TEs) can regulate the expression of neighbouring genes. However, their ability to act in trans and influence ectopic loci has been reported rarely. We searched in rice transcriptomes for tissue-specific expression of TEs and found them to be regulated developmentally. They often shared sequence homology with co-expressed genes and contained potential microRNA-binding sites, which suggested possible contributions to gene regulation. In fact, we have identified a retrotransposon that is highly transcribed in roots and whose spliced transcript constitutes a target mimic for miR171. miR171 destabilizes mRNAs encoding the root-specific family of SCARECROW-Like transcription factors. We demonstrate that retrotransposon-derived transcripts act as decoys for miR171, triggering its degradation and thus results in the root-specific accumulation of SCARECROW-Like mRNAs. Such transposon-mediated post-transcriptional control of miR171 levels is conserved in diverse rice species.
28838812	Polyphasic characterization of bacteria obtained from upland rice cultivated in Cerrado soil.	2017	Braz J Microbiol	This work aimed to characterize 20 isolates obtained from upland rice plants, based on phenotypic (morphology, enzymatic activity, inorganic phosphate solubilization, carbon source use, antagonism), genotypic assays (16S rRNA sequencing) and plant growth promotion. Results showed a great morphological, metabolic and genetic variability among bacterial isolates. All isolates showed positive activity for catalase and protease enzymes and, 90% of the isolates showed positive activity for amylase, catalase and, nitrogenase. All isolates were able to metabolize sucrose and malic acid in contrast with mannitol, which was metabolized only by one isolate. For the other carbon sources, we observed a great variability in its use by the isolates. Most isolates showed antibiosis against Rhizoctonia solani (75%) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (55%) and, 50% of them showed antibiosis against both pathogens. Six isolates showed simultaneous ability of antibiosis, inorganic phosphate solubilization and protease activity. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene all the isolates belong to Bacillus genus. Under greenhouse conditions, two isolates (S4 and S22) improved to about 24%, 25%, 30% and 31% the Total N, leaf area, shoot dry weight and root dry weight, respectively, of rice plants, indicating that they should be tested for this ability under field conditions.
28821707	Molecular bases for differential aging programs between flag and second leaves during grain-filling in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Flag leaves (FL) and second leaves (SL) in rice show differential aging patterns during monocarpic senescence. Coordination of aging programs between FL and SL is important for grain yield and quality. However, the molecular bases for differential aging programs between FL and SL have not been systematically explored in rice. Here, we performed mRNA-sequencing of FL and SL at six time points during grain-filling and identified four molecular bases for differential aging programs between FL and SL: phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, amino acid (AA) transport, and hormone response. Of them, photosynthesis (carbon assimilation) and AA transport (nitrogen remobilization) predominantly occurred in FL and SL, respectively, during grain-filling. Unlike other molecular bases, AA transport showed consistent differential expression patterns between FL and SL in independent samples. Moreover, long-distance AA transporters showed invariant differential expression patterns between FL and SL after panicle removal, which was consistent to invariant differential nitrogen contents between FL and SL after panicle removal. Therefore, our results suggest that the supplies of carbon and nitrogen to seeds is functionally segregated between FL and SL and that long-distance AA transport is an invariant core program for high nitrogen remobilization in SL.
28859136	Integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling in rice backcrossed progenies (BC2F12) with different plant height.	2017	PLoS One	Inter-specific hybridization and backcrossing commonly occur in plants. The use of progeny generated from inter-specific hybridization and backcrossing has been developed as a novel model system to explore gene expression divergence. The present study investigated the analysis of gene expression and miRNA regulation in backcrossed introgression lines constructed from cultivated and wild rice. High-throughput sequencing was used to compare gene and miRNA expression profiles in three progeny lines (L1710, L1817 and L1730), with different plant heights resulting from the backcrossing of introgression lines (BC2F12) and their parents (O. sativa and O. longistaminata). A total of 25,387 to 26,139 mRNAs and 379 to 419 miRNAs were obtained in these rice lines. More differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were detected in progeny/O. longistaminata comparison groups than in progeny/O. sativa comparison groups. Approximately 80% of the genes and miRNAs showed expression level dominance to O. sativa, indicating that three progeny lines were closer to the recurrent parent, which might be influenced by their parental genome dosage. Approximately 16% to 64% of the differentially expressed miRNAs possessing coherent target genes were predicted, and many of these miRNAs regulated multiple target genes. Most genes were up-regulated in progeny lines compared with their parents, but down-regulated in the higher plant height line in the comparison groups among the three progeny lines. Moreover, certain genes related to cell walls and plant hormones might play crucial roles in the plant height variations of the three progeny lines. Taken together, these results provided valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of hybrid backcrossing and plant height variations based on the gene and miRNA expression levels in the three progeny lines.
28555319	Proteomic Analysis of Rice Seedlings Under Cold Stress.	2017	Protein J	Low temperature can greatly restrict the growth and development of rice. The rice seedlings show growth retardation, lamina wrap, and part of blade even died under the condition of low temperature. In order to get more information about cold stress responses in rice, two dimensional electrophoresis and bioinformatics analysis of mass spectrometry were used to preliminary survey the cold tolerance of cold sensitive line 9311 and cold resistance variety Fujisaka 5 under cold stress. Two dimensional electrophoresis maps of 9311 and Fujisaka 5 were established under cold treatment. With analysis of bioinformation, the proteins were found involve in many aspects of rice development. The largest category of proteins is functioning on metabolism. By comparing the proteins from the two varieties, it can be found that most proteins from 9311 were down-regulated and were up-regulated in Fujisaka 5. The results showed that the membrane composition and structure were damaged, metabolism changed dramatically and rice defense system was activated under the cold stimulation. Fifty-nine proteins related to the resistance of cold stress were identified in our study, and we have investigated and classified all of their biological functions. The importance of our study are providing some conduct for the research of rice resistant to cold stress, supporting auxiliary technique for rice varieties and widening the search field of cold tolerance in plants.
28795219	Development of 25 near-isogenic lines (NILs) with ten BPH resistance genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.): production, resistance spectrum, and molecular analysis.	2017	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: A first set of 25 NILs carrying ten BPH resistance genes and their pyramids was developed in the background of indica variety IR24 for insect resistance breeding in rice. Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal.) is one of the most destructive insect pests in rice. Development of near-isogenic lines (NILs) is an important strategy for genetic analysis of brown planthopper (BPH) resistance (R) genes and their deployment against diverse BPH populations. A set of 25 NILs with 9 single R genes and 16 multiple R gene combinations consisting of 11 two-gene pyramids and 5 three-gene pyramids in the genetic background of the susceptible indica rice cultivar IR24 was developed through marker-assisted selection. The linked DNA markers for each of the R genes were used for foreground selection and confirming the introgressed regions of the BPH R genes. Modified seed box screening and feeding rate of BPH were used to evaluate the spectrum of resistance. BPH reaction of each of the NILs carrying different single genes was variable at the antibiosis level with the four BPH populations of the Philippines. The NILs with two- to three-pyramided genes showed a stronger level of antibiosis (49.3-99.0%) against BPH populations compared with NILs with a single R gene NILs (42.0-83.5%) and IR24 (10.0%). Background genotyping by high-density SNPs markers revealed that most of the chromosome regions of the NILs (BC3F5) had IR24 genome recovery of 82.0-94.2%. Six major agronomic data of the NILs showed a phenotypically comparable agronomic performance with IR24. These newly developed NILs will be useful as new genetic resources for BPH resistance breeding and are valuable sources of genes in monitoring against the emerging BPH biotypes in different rice-growing countries.
28786735	Identification of the actual coding region for polyamine oxidase 6 from rice (OsPAO6) and its partial characterization.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	Polyamines (PA) in plant play roles in growth and development and in responses to environmental stresses. The family of polyamine oxidases (PAO) contributes to a balanced homeostasis of PAs catalyzing two different reactions, terminal catabolic (TC) and back-conversion (BC) pathway, in PA catabolism. From the seven PAOs encoded by the rice genome (OsPAO1 - OsPAO7) OsPAO6 could so far not be characterized due to failure in obtaining the coding cDNA based on accessions in the genomic databases. We report cloning and characterization of the correct OsPAO6 cDNA with a length of 1,742 bp. The 1,491 bp long open reading frame codes for a 497-amino acid protein from nine exons. The protein which has 92% identity to OsPAO7 localizes to plasma membrane.

12471446	Cereal genes similar to Snf2 define a new subfamily that includes human and mouse genes.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	Genes from the SNF2 family play important roles in transcriptional regulation, maintenance of chromosome integrity and DNA repair. This study describes the molecular cloning and characterization of cereal genes from this family. The predicted proteins exhibit a novel C-terminal domain that defines a new subfamily designated SNF2P that includes human and mouse proteins. Comparison between genomic and cDNA sequences showed that cereal Snf2P genes consisted of 17 exons, including one only 8 bp long. Two barley alleles differed by the presence of a 7.7-kb non-LTR retrotransposon in intron 6. An alternative annotation of the orthologous Arabidopsis gene would improve its similarity with the other members of the subfamily. Intron 2 was not spliced out in approximately half of the rice Snf2P mRNAs present in leaves, resulting in a premature stop codon. Transcripts from the barley and wheat Snf2P genes were found in apexes, leaves, sheaths, roots and spikes. The Snf2P genes exist as single copies on wheat chromosome arm 5A(m)L and in the colinear regions on barley chromosome arm 4HL and rice chromosome 3. High-density genetic mapping and RT-PCR suggest that Snf2P is not a candidate gene for the tightly linked vernalization gene Vrn2.
11572990	Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice. The cloned 6,227-bp-long Reb gene is composed of six exons and five introns and is flanked by a 1.2-kb 5' promoter and a 1.2-kb 3' terminator region. The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system. The effector constructs containing the native gene or fusion genes linking Reb to the rice actin (Act) or globulin (Glb) gene promoters and the reporter gene construct Glb-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) were used in this study. When these effector constructs were cotransferred with the reporter uidA gene encoding GUS under the control of the Glb promoter into immature rice endosperm cells, the Glb promoter was activated. The transient GUS expression was 2.0 to 2.5-fold higher with the effector construct than without. When the upstream activation sequence containing the GCCACGT(A/C)AG motifs of the Glb promoter was deleted, the activation by REB was abolished. On the other hand, a gain-of-function experiment showed that inserting the upstream activation sequence into the glutelin-1 (Gt1) promoter made it responsive to activation by REB. When cotransformed with Reb gene, mature transgenic rice grains containing the human lysozyme gene driven by the Glb promoter produced 3.7-fold more lysozyme. Accumulation of recombinant lysozyme in mature seed ranged from 30.57 to 279.61 microg.mg(-1) total soluble protein in individual transformants from 30 independent transformation events. Thus, our results show that REB is not only a transcriptional activator, it can also be used to increase the expression of recombinant protein in transgenic rice grains.
15061077	Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings.	2004	Plant Physiol Biochem	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroids essential for normal growth and development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which BRs regulate the growth and development of plants, it is necessary to identify and analyze more genes that are regulated by BRs. A novel brassinolide (BL)-enhanced gene designated OsBLE1, which was originally identified by using rice (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA microarray, was cloned and characterized. Its cDNA is 598 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide with 81 amino acid residues. Northern blots analysis revealed that OsBLE1 expression began to increase at 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h after BL treatment. OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression. OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial. Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE1 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth. Results suggest that OsBLE1 might be involved in BL-regulated growth processes in rice seedlings.
11713671	Kiddo, a new transposable element family closely associated with rice genes.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	The promoter region of the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) gene was found to be polymorphic between japonica (T309) and indica (IR24) lines as the result of a 270-bp deletion in T309. A TTATA footprint in the T309 rubq2 promoter suggested that an excision event had occurred, and inspection of the 270-bp region present in IR24 revealed that it had all the characteristics of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE). Database searches showed that this element is a member of a new MITE family, which we have named Kiddo. Thirty-five complete Kiddo sequences were identified in existing rice genomic sequence databases. They could be arranged into four groups, within-group sequence identity was over 90%, with 65-75% identity between groups. The high sequence similarity within a group indicates that some Kiddo members were recently mobile and may still be active. An additional 24 decayed Kiddo sequences were detected. Interestingly, approximately 80% of 18 Kiddo members from annotated accessions lie within 530 bp of a coding sequence. That approximately 40% of Kiddo members present in genic regions reside in introns suggests that Kiddo transposition entails the use of both DNA and RNA intermediates, and may provide some insight into the origins of individual groups. DNA blot analysis showed that Kiddo is a rice-specific element, although one sequence with limited (72%) similarity to Kiddo group A was detected as a wheat EST. Kiddo family members may represent new molecular and phylogenetic markers, as well as representing valuable materials for studying the molecular mechanisms of MITE transposition.
13677471	A novel brassinolide-enhanced gene identified by cDNA microarray is involved in the growth of rice.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are growth-promoting natural substances required for normal plant growth and development. To understand the molecular mechanism of BR action, a cDNA microarray containing 1265 rice genes was analyzed for expression differences in rice lamina joint treated with brassinolide (BL). A novel BL-enhanced gene, designated OsBLE2, was identified and cloned. The full-length cDNA is 3243 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 761 amino acid residues and nine possible transmembrane regions. OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings. Besides, auxin and gibberellins also increased its expression. OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation. Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE2 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth. BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1 . BL effect in the d1 mutant rice was much weaker than that in its wild-type control, indicating that heterotrimeric G protein may be a component of BRs signaling. These results suggest that OsBLE2 is involved in BL-regulated growth and development processes in rice.
15805485	A two-edged role for the transposable element Kiddo in the rice ubiquitin2 promoter.	2005	Plant Cell	Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are thought to be a driving force for genome evolution. Although numerous MITEs are found associated with genes, little is known about their function in gene regulation. Whereas the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) promoter in rice (Oryza sativa) line IR24 contains two nested MITEs (Kiddo and MDM1), that in line T309 has lost Kiddo, providing an opportunity to understand the role of MITEs in promoter function. No difference in endogenous rubq2 transcript levels between T309 and IR24 was evident using RT-PCR. However, promoter analysis using both transient and stably transformed calli revealed that Kiddo contributed some 20% of the total expression. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the rubq2 promoters revealed specific DNA methylation at both symmetric and asymmetric cytosine residues on the MITE sequences, possibly induced by low levels of homologous transcripts. When methylation of the MITEs was blocked by 5-azacytidine treatment, a threefold increase in the endogenous rubq2 transcript level was detected in IR24 compared with that in T309. Together with the observed MITE methylation pattern, the detection of low levels of transcripts, but not small RNAs, corresponding to Kiddo and MDM1 suggested that RNA-dependent DNA methylation is induced by MITE transcripts. We conclude that, although Kiddo enhances transcription from the rubq2 promoter, this effect is mitigated by sequence-specific epigenetic modification.
10557360	Oryza sativa PSK gene encodes a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha, a sulfated peptide growth factor found in plants.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Phytosulfokine-alpha [PSK-alpha, Tyr(SO(3)H)-Ile-Tyr(SO(3)H)-Thr-Gln], a sulfated mitogenic peptide found in plants, strongly promotes proliferation of plant cells in culture at very low concentrations. Oryza sativa PSK (OsPSK) cDNA encoding a PSK-alpha precursor has been isolated. The cDNA is 725 base pairs long, and the 89-aa product, preprophytosulfokine, has a 22-aa hydrophobic region that resembles a cleavable leader peptide at its NH(2) terminus. The PSK-alpha sequence occurs only once within the precursor, close to the COOH terminus. [Ser(4)]PSK-alpha was secreted by transgenic rice Oc cells harboring a mutated OsPSK cDNA, suggesting proteolytic processing from the larger precursor, a feature commonly found in animal systems. Whereas PSK-alpha in conditioned medium with sense transgenic Oc cells was 1.6 times as concentrated as in the control case, antisense transgenic Oc cells produced less than 60% of the control level. Preprophytosulfokine mRNA was detected at an elevated constitutive level in rice Oc culture cells on RNA blot analysis. Although PSK-alpha molecules have never been identified in any intact plant, reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPSK is expressed in rice seedlings, indicating that PSK-alpha may be important for plant cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. DNA blot analysis demonstrated that OsPSK homologs may occur in dicot as well as monocot plants.
11198424	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsPSK, a gene encoding a precursor for phytosulfokine-alpha, required for rice cell proliferation.	2000	Plant Mol Biol	We previously characterized an OsPSK cDNA encoding a precursor of phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a peptide plant growth factor. Southern blot analysis suggested that OsPSK is a single-copy gene in rice, which we have isolated and characterized. The OsPSK gene consists of one large intron and two exons. The 5-amino acid PSK-alpha sequence located close to the COOH-terminus of the precursor is encoded in the second exon. A putative TATA box was found at position -68 with respect to the transcription initiation site. Upstream of this sequence, several potential regulatory elements, including one CAAT-box, three CCAAT-boxes, one enhancer core-like sequence, and three E-boxes could be identified. By constructing plasmids with various lengths of the 5'-upstream regions of the OsPSK gene fused to the coding sequence for bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS), we demonstrated a region 1.9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation point, which contains most of the putative 5'-regulatory elements, to be sufficient for maximal-level GUS expression in transformed rice Oc cells. The promoter of the OsPSK gene gave significantly higher levels of GUS expression than the CaMV 35S promoter. These results suggest that the OsPSK promoter could be useful for the constitutive expression of a foreign gene at high levels in transformed rice culture cells. Northern blot analyses suggest that the expression of OsPSK is reinforced by auxin and cytokinin.
12369615	The OsEBP-89 gene of rice encodes a putative EREBP transcription factor and is temporally expressed in developing endosperm and intercalary meristem.	2002	Plant Mol Biol	The AP2/EREBP transcription factors play important roles in plant development and in the responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. All members of the EREBP subfamily described to date are from dicotyledonous plants. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsEBP-89, encoding a protein 326 amino acids long with a typical EREBP domain; this is the first report of an EREBP transcription factor in a monocotyledonous plant. Except for the EREBP domain, the OsEBP-89 protein does not have substantial sequence similarities to other members of the subfamily. The DNA-binding activity of the EREBP domain was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. An activation domain rich in acidic amino acids was identified by using a yeast one-hybrid system. Two putative nuclear-localization signals were also identified. The results of northern blot hybridization experiments showed that the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene accumulates primarily in immature seeds, roots, and leaves (low levels). More detailed information about the pattern of OsEBP-89 gene expression was obtained by histochemical studies of transgenic rice plants carrying an OsEBP-89 5'/GUS reporter gene. The reporter gene was expressed in the endosperm starting at 7 days after pollination and in the intercalary meristem of plants. Expression of OsEBP-89 was induced in roots of rice seedlings by treatment with ACC, NaCl, or 2,4-D. Two cis-acting elements, an endosperm motif and a primary PERE, are present upstream of the OsEBP-89 coding region and may be involved in regulating its expression. Collectively, these results suggest that the OsEBP-89 gene is a new member of the EREBP subfamily and may be involved in ethylene-dependent seed maturation and shoot development of rice.
12091716	OSTF1: a HD-GL2 family homeobox gene is developmentally regulated during early embryogenesis in rice.	2002	Plant Cell Physiol	In many eukaryotic organisms, homeobox genes are important regulators that specify the cell fate and body plan in early embryogenesis. In this study, a gene designated OSTF1 (Oryza sativa transcription factor 1) encoding a homeodomain protein in rice was isolated and characterized. The encoded OSTF1, although sharing only approximately 51% sequence identity with other HD-GL2 members, contains four characteristic motifs (an N-terminal acidic region, a homeodomain, a truncated leucine zipper, and a START domain). OSTF1 was detected as a single copy gene in rice. The transcripts were absent in young panicle or mature spikelet before anthesis, but appeared very early in the pollinated grain with a transient profile. In vegetative tissues examined, expression was only detectable in root. In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3-6 d after pollination. Expression was also detectable in the integument and throughout the endosperm. Although OSTF1 is not closely related to the remaining HD-GL2 members in sequences, this gene exhibits an analogous epidermis-preferential expression pattern.
8260630	Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We isolated a rice cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK, EC 2.7.4.6). The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice NDK shows highest homology to spinach NDK-I. The rice NDK gene exhibits a strong codon bias (73.8% GC) in the third position of the codon. DNA blot analysis indicated that at least single NDK gene is present in rice genome.
11148291	Hd1, a major photoperiod sensitivity quantitative trait locus in rice, is closely related to the Arabidopsis flowering time gene CONSTANS.	2000	Plant Cell	A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling response to photoperiod, Hd1, was identified by means of a map-based cloning strategy. High-resolution mapping using 1505 segregants enabled us to define a genomic region of approximately 12 kb as a candidate for Hd1. Further analysis revealed that the Hd1 QTL corresponds to a gene that is a homolog of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis. Sequencing analysis revealed a 43-bp deletion in the first exon of the photoperiod sensitivity 1 (se1) mutant HS66 and a 433-bp insertion in the intron in mutant HS110. Se1 is allelic to the Hd1 QTL, as determined by analysis of two se1 mutants, HS66 and HS110. Genetic complementation analysis proved the function of the candidate gene. The amount of Hd1 mRNA was not greatly affected by a change in length of the photoperiod. We suggest that Hd1 functions in the promotion of heading under short-day conditions and in inhibition under long-day conditions.
14754915	Differential expression of three genes encoding an ethylene receptor in rice during development, and in response to indole-3-acetic acid and silver ions.	2004	J Exp Bot	Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice. The genomic structure of OS-ERS1 and OS-ERS2 revealed that the introns within the coding sequences occurred in conserved positions to those of At-ETR1 and At-ERS1, whereas each of the OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 genes contained 1 intron within its coding region located at a position equivalent to those of At-ERS2, At-ETR2, and At-EIN4. Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species. Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the OS-ERS1 transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions. Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (OS-ERS1 and OS-ETR2). However, the abundance of OS-ERS2 mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene. Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice. Moreover, higher levels of these three mRNAs were commonly observed in anthers when compared with their corresponding levels in other tissues, suggesting the important role played by ethylene involved in the regulation of pollen development in rice. Among the five ethylene receptor genes, the expression levels of both OS-ETR3 and OS-ETR4 were too low to be detected by the northern blot analysis. Results from RT-PCR illustrated that both mRNAs were present in young green rice seedlings and anthers.
15078336	Development of an efficient method for the isolation of factors involved in gene transcription during rice embryo development.	2004	Plant J	Summary An efficient yeast-based system was developed for the isolation of plant cDNAs encoding transcription factors (TFs) and proteins with transcription activation functions (co-activators). The system consists of two vectors: (i) a reporter vector (pG221) harboring the iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) core promoter and the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene; and (ii) a cDNA library construction vector (pYF503), which yields a library of plant peptides fused to the GAL4-binding domain (GAL4-BD). Expression of a peptide harboring the characteristics of a transcriptional activator leads to expression of lacZ, allowing for selection of relevant colonies. TFs during rice embryo development were isolated through this system. Approximately 200 confirmed positive colonies were obtained from screening 10(6) yeast colonies, and sequence analysis of conserved domains identified 75 independent cDNAs, 20 of which encoded plant TFs or co-activators, including members of the APETALA2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein (EREBP), MYB and growth-regulating factor (GRF) families. Peptides encoded by 13 of the isolated cDNAs were classified as potential TFs or co-activators because of the presence of conserved TF-like domains. Additionally, 2, 11, and 13 clones encoded kinases, chromosome-related proteins, and unknown proteins, respectively, while the remaining 16 cDNAs were associated with specific functions seemingly unrelated to TFs. Expression pattern analysis of selected TF-encoding genes via RT-PCR revealed that these genes were expressed during seed development, with differential transcription observed during various stages. This work provides informative hints for further study of the regulatory mechanism of rice seed development and illustrates an identification strategy that will be of practical value for the isolation of TFs and co-activators associated with specific plant developmental processes.
16006597	OsPTF1, a novel transcription factor involved in tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.	2005	Plant Physiol	We report here on a novel transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix domain for tolerance to inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation in rice (Oryza sativa). The gene is designated OsPTF1. The expression of OsPTF1 is Pi starvation induced in roots while constitutively expressed in shoots, as shown by northern-blot analysis. Overexpression of OsPTF1 enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation in transgenic rice. Tillering ability, root and shoot biomass, and phosphorus content of transgenic rice plants were about 30% higher than those of the wild-type plants in Pi-deficient conditions in hydroponic experiments. In soil pot and field experiments, more than 20% increase in tiller number, panicle weight, and phosphorus content was observed in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants at low-Pi levels. In Pi-deficient conditions, transgenic rice plants showed significantly higher total root length and root surface area, which results in a higher instantaneous Pi uptake rate over their wild-type counterparts. Microarray analysis for transgenic plants overexpressing OsPTF1 has been performed to investigate the downstream regulation of OsPTF1.
9311985	RF2a, a bZIP transcriptional activator of the phloem-specific rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter, functions in vascular development.	1997	EMBO J	Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) replicates only in phloem cells in infected rice plants and its promoter drives strong phloem-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic rice plants. We isolated a cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, RF2a, which binds to the Box II cis element that is important for expression from the promoter. RF2a, which stimulates Box II-dependent transcription in a homologous in vitro transcription system, accumulates in nuclei of phloem and certain other cell types in shoots, but is found at only very low levels in roots. Transgenic antisense plants in which RF2a accumulation was suppressed had normal roots but stunted, twisted leaves with small, disorganized vascular bundles, an enlarged sclerenchyma and large air spaces. We propose that the RTBV promoter exploits a host transcription factor that is critical for leaf tissue differentiation and vascular development for its expression.
9491803	Molecular cloning of the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of plant DNA polymerase alpha and its cell-cycle dependent expression.	1997	Genes Cells	BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase alpha has been studied in considerable detail in yeast and animals. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that this enzyme is composed of a heterotetramer and is necessary for replicon initiation and primer synthesis in lagging strand synthesis. In spite of the fact that modes of DNA replication in plants seem to be similar to those in other eukaryotes, very little is known about the biochemical components that participate in DNA replication of plants, including DNA polymerases.

RESULTS: Using a 561-base pair DNA fragment, obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a rice cDNA library as a probe, we isolated and sequenced a cDNA homologous to the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of rice DNA polymerase alpha. The encoded polypeptide has extensive homology with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha from several species. Furthermore, when the cDNA was expressed in eukaryotic transcription/translation systems, the protein products showed DNA polymerase activity which was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for DNA polymerase alpha. Using RNA gel blot analysis, we found that the levels of mRNA of the catalytic subunit of this enzyme is regulated during the cell-cycle in plant cells.

CONCLUSION: This is the first report which describes the cDNA cloning of plant DNA polymerase. We conclude that the principal features of the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit are conserved in plants.
8589938	Characterization of a cDNA clone encoding 23 kDa polypeptide of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II in rice.	1995	Plant Cell Physiol	We isolated a cDNA for a gene that encodes the 23 kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II in rice. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA is highly similar (71-60% homology) to those of the analogous genes from wheat, tomato, pea, spinach, tobacco and mustard. The expression of the gene that corresponds to the 23 kDa protein was inducible in green organs of mature and immature leaves, stems and young panicles but not inducible in roots. The high level of the transcripts was detected in both mature leaves and young panicles. The expression of the gene was low in etiolated seedlings, while the transcript of the gene was strongly induced by light, and the level of the expression increased during light irradiation. These observations suggest that the expression of the gene encoding the 23 kDa protein is organ-specific and light-inducible.
9880347	Temporal and spatial patterns of accumulation of the transcript of Myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase and phytin-containing particles during seed development in rice.	1999	Plant Physiol	Myo-inositol-1-phosphate (I[1]P) synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) catalyzes the reaction from glucose 6-phosphate to I(1)P, the first step of myo-inositol biosynthesis. Among the metabolites of I(1)P is inositol hexakisphosphate, which forms a mixed salt called phytin or phytate, a storage form of phosphate and cations in seeds. We have isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA clone, pRINO1, that is highly homologous to the I(1)P synthase from yeast and plants. Northern analysis of total RNA showed that the transcript accumulated to high levels in embryos but was undetectable in shoots, roots, and flowers. In situ hybridization of developing seeds showed that the transcript first appeared in the apical region of globular-stage embryos 2 d after anthesis (DAA). Strong signals were detected in the scutellum and aleurone layer after 4 DAA. The level of the transcript in these cells increased until 7 DAA, after which time it gradually decreased. Phytin-containing particles called globoids appeared 4 DAA in the scutellum and aleurone layer, coinciding with the localization of the RINO1 transcript. The temporal and spatial patterns of accumulation of the RINO1 transcript and globoids suggest that I(1)P synthase directs phytin biosynthesis in rice seeds.
11975732	The synergistic effects of sugar and abscisic acid on myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase expression.	2002	Physiol Plant	1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate [Ins(1)P1] synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) catalyses the formation of Ins(1)P1 from glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in the biosynthesis of myo-inositol. Ins(1)P1 is a precursor of phytin (inositol hexakisphosphate), a storage form of phosphate and cations in seeds. Since sucrose and abscisic acid (ABA) are known to affect synthesis of storage compounds in seeds, we investigated the effects of ABA and sucrose on Ins(1)P1 synthase gene (RINO1) expression in cultured cells derived from the scutellum of mature rice seeds. Higher levels of RINO1 transcript accumulation were evident after treatment with either sucrose (10-100 mM) or ABA (10-8 M to 10-4 M). Glucose was also effective in the upregulation, whereas mannitol was not, suggesting that sucrose and glucose acted as metabolizable sugars and not as osmotica. Treatment with ABA and sucrose together resulted in much higher levels of transcript accumulation, suggesting a synergistic induction of the Ins(1)P1 synthase gene.
14634157	Expression analyses of beta-tubulin isotype genes in rice.	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Microtubules play important roles in many cellular processes, such as cell division and cell elongation in plants. beta-tubulins, which are the basic components of microtubules, are encoded by multigene family in eukaryotes and their nucleotide sequences are highly conserved in protein coding regions. A homology search within the rice expressed sequence tag database identified at least eight beta-tubulin (OsTUB) isotypes including three novel OsTUB genes. Northern analysis using specific probes to 3'-UTR of OsTUB isotypes showed differential and tissue-specific expression. Seven out of eight OsTUB genes dominantly expressed in leaf sheath, while OsTUB8 was preferentially expressed in anther including mature pollens. The existence of anther-specific beta-tubulin suggests its unique role in the formation of microtubules during the anther and pollen development or pollen tube growth. Furthermore, transcripts of OsTUB5, 6 and 7 genes were significantly enhanced by gibberellin but all eight OsTUB genes were repressed by abscisic acid. Our results imply that OsTUB genes are differentially regulated by developmental and hormonal signals and different OsTUB isotypes might play special role in the growth and development of specific organs in rice.
9465073	Expression of Xa1, a bacterial blight-resistance gene in rice, is induced by bacterial inoculation.	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The Xa1 gene in rice confers resistance to Japanese race 1 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal pathogen of bacterial blight (BB). We isolated the Xa1 gene by a map-based cloning strategy. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Xa1 gene product contains nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and a new type of leucine-rich repeats (LRR); thus, Xa1 is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease-resistance genes, but quite different from Xa21, another BB-resistance gene isolated from rice. Interestingly, Xa1 gene expression was induced on inoculation with a bacterial pathogen and wound, unlike other isolated resistance genes in plants, which show constitutive expression. The induced expression may be involved in enhancement of resistance against the pathogen.
8455556	Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	We previously reported the isolation of rgp1, a gene from rice, which encodes a ras-related GTP-binding protein, and subsequently showed that the gene induces specific morphological changes in transgenic tobacco plants. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an rgp1 homologue, rgp2, from rice. The deduced rgp2 protein sequence shows 53% identity with the rice rgp1 protein, but 63% identity with both the marine ray ora3 protein, which is closely associated with synaptic vesicles of neuronal tissue, and the mammalian rab11 protein. Conservation of particular amino acid sequence motifs places rgp2 in the rab/ypt subfamily, which has been implicated in vesicular transport. Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots. In addition, whereas rgp1 shows maximal expression at a particular stage of plantlet growth, rgp2 is constitutively expressed during the same period. Southern blot analysis suggests that, in addition to rgp1 and rgp2, several other homologues exist in rice and these may constitute a small multigene family.
10811811	Sequence-specific DNA recognition by the Myb-like domain of plant telomeric protein RTBP1.	2000	J Biol Chem	We have identified a rice gene encoding a DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes the telomeric repeat sequence TTTAGGG found in plants. This gene, which we refer to as RTBP1 (rice telomere-binding protein 1), encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa. RTBP1 is ubiquitously expressed in various organs and binds DNA with two or more duplex TTTAGGG repeats. The predicted protein sequence includes a single domain at the C terminus with extensive homology to Myb-like DNA binding motif. The Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is very closely related to that of other telomere-binding proteins, including TRF1, TRF2, Taz1p, and Tbf1p, indicating that DNA-binding domains of telomere-binding proteins are well conserved among evolutionarily distant species. To obtain precise information on the sequence of the DNA binding site recognized by RTBP1, we analyzed the sequence-specific binding properties of the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1. The isolated Myb-like domain was capable of sequence-specific DNA binding as a homodimer. Gel retardation analysis with a series of mutated telomere probes revealed that the internal GGGTTT sequence in the two-telomere repeats is critical for binding of Myb-like domain of RTBP1, which is consistent with the model of the TRF1.DNA complex showing that base-specific contacts are made within the sequence GGGTTA. To the best of our knowledge, RTBP1 is the first cloned gene in which the product is able to bind double-stranded telomeric DNA in plants. Because the Myb-like domain appears to be a significant motif for a large class of proteins that bind the duplex telomeric DNA, RTBP1 may play important roles in plant telomere function in vivo.
11233258	[Differential accumulation of the new high-affinity phosphate transporter candidated gene fragment in rice roots in response to phosphorus deficiency stress].	2001	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Phosphate is a major constraint to crop production, and phosphate uptake in plant is mainly by high-affinity phosphate transporter under phosphate deficiency condition. Using RT-PCR, a 1,178 bp phosphate transporter gene fragment OjPT1 was cloned from roots of Jingxi17 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japanica) supplied with no phosphate. The comparison of this sequence with ones in GenBank indicated that it shared about 70% similarity at amino acid level with other phosphate transporters in higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, potate, tamato, Medicago truncatula and Catharanthus roseus, and high similarity with phosphate transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa. RT-PCR assay showed that the OjPT1 transcripts were induced under phosphate deficiency condition. This gene fragment OjPT1 has been deposited in GenBank (accession No. AF249619).
9461411	A novel MT gene of rice plants is strongly expressed in the node portion of the stem.	1998	Gene	We identified a cDNA encoding a metallothionein (MT)-like protein from a cDNA library of rice endosperm. This cDNA (ricMT) encoded an open reading frame of 80 amino acids, with two cysteine-rich domains at the amino-terminus and carboxy-terminus, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of class I MT-like proteins. Southern blot analysis revealed that the gene exists at one locus in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis with rice seedlings showed that the transcript level in shoots was elevated by the addition of metal ions, such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe, Pb and A1, whereas in roots it was reduced in the presence of metal ions other than copper. The expression level of ricMT in mature rice plants was extremely high in stems relative to leaf blades, leaf sheaths, endosperm and roots. In the first nodes, the yield of the transcript was 150-times higher than that in leaf blades. These results suggest that ricMT protein may play an important role in the metabolism of metal elements in the stem.
11247601	Protein phosphatase 2A: identification in Oryza sativa of the gene encoding the regulatory A subunit.	2001	Plant Mol Biol	A 2225 bp cDNA, designated RPA1, was isolated from an Oryza sativa cDNA library. Analysis revealed a 1761 bp coding sequence with 15 non-identical repeat units. The ORF encoded the A regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-A) as ascertained by complementation of the yeast tpd3 mutant defective in this gene. The corresponding genomic DNA from a rice genome BAC library revealed that the gene contains eleven introns. The rice genome contains only a single copy of this gene as judged by Southern blot analysis. The PP2A protein is highly conserved in nature; the rice protein shows 88% amino acid identity with its counterparts in Arabidopsis or Nicotiana tabacum.

12207219	Genome sequencing of a 239-kb region of rice chromosome 10L reveals a high frequency of gene duplication and a large chloroplast DNA insertion.	2002	Mol Genet Genomics	In this study we describe a 239-kb region on the long arm of rice chromosome 10 that contains a high density (71%) of locally duplicated genes, including 24 copies of a glutathione S-transferase gene. Intriguingly, embedded within this cluster is a large insertion (approximately 33 kb) of rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast DNA that is derived from two separate regions of the chloroplast genome. We used DNA fiber-based fluorescence in situ hybridization (fiber-FISH) analyses of O. sativa spp. japonica nuclei to confirm that the insertion of organellar DNA was not a cloning artifact. The sequence of the chloroplast insertion is nearly identical (99.7% identity) to the corresponding regions in the published rice chloroplast genome sequence, suggesting that the transfer event occurred recently. PCR amplification and sequence analysis in two subspecies of rice, O. sativa spp. japonica and spp. indica, indicates that the transfer event predated the divergence of these two subspecies. The chloroplast insertion is flanked by a 2.1-kb perfect direct repeat that is unique to this location in the rice genome.
8389618	Anaerobiosis and plant growth hormones induce two genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1993	Mol Biol Cell	The plant hormone ethylene is believed to be responsible for the ability of rice to grow in the deepwater regions of Southeast Asia. Ethylene production is induced by hypoxia, which is caused by flooding, because of enhanced activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, the key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. We have cloned three divergent members, (OS-ACS1, OS-ACS2, and OS-ACS3), of a multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice. OS-ACS1 resides on chromosome 3 and OS-ACS3 on chromosome 5 in the rice genome. The OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS3 genes are induced by anaerobiosis and indoleacetic acid (IAA) + benzyladenine (BA) + LiCl treatment. The anaerobic induction is differential and tissue specific; OS-ACS1 is induced in the shoots, whereas OS-ACS3 is induced in the roots. These inductions are insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that they are primary responses to the inducers. All three genes are actually induced when protein synthesis is inhibited, indicating that they may be under negative control or that their mRNAs are unstable. The OS-ACS1 gene was structurally characterized, and the function of its encoded protein (M(r) = 53 112 Da, pI 8.2) was confirmed by expression experiments in Escherichia coli. The protein contains all eleven invariant amino acid residues that are conserved between aminotransferases and ACC synthases cloned from various dicotyledonous plants. The amino acid sequence shares significant identity to other ACC synthases (69-34%) and is more similar to sequences in other plant species (69% with the tomato LE-ACS3) than to other rice ACC synthases (50-44%). The data suggest that the extraordinary degree of divergence among ACC synthase isoenzymes within each species arose early in plant evolution and before the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.
15377756	Spotted leaf11, a negative regulator of plant cell death and defense, encodes a U-box/armadillo repeat protein endowed with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.	2004	Plant Cell	The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map-based cloning strategy. The isolation of the Spl11 gene was facilitated by the identification of three additional spl11 alleles from an IR64 mutant collection. The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U-box domain and an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein-protein interactions, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U-box-ARM proteins is mostly restricted to the U-box and ARM repeat regions. A single base substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop codon in the SPL11 protein. Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice-blast interactions. In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense.
12160464	Molecular and biochemical characterization of a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein kinase from rice.	2002	Biochem J	A Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein kinase from rice ( Oryza sativa ), OsCBK, has been characterized that lacks Ca2+-binding EF hands and has Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation and substrate-phosphorylation activity. OsCBK has all 11 subdomains of a kinase catalytic domain and a putative CaM-binding domain, and shares high identity with Ca2+-dependent-protein-kinase ('CDPK')-related protein kinases in plants. OsCBK bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner as previously reported for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in animals, but autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of histone IIIs were Ca2+/CaM-independent. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that OsCBK specifically bound CaM with high affinity ( K (D)=30 nM). Capillary electrophoresis showed that phosphorylation of OsCBK occurred on serine and threonine residues. These data show that OsCBK is a serine/threonine protein kinase that binds Ca2+/CaM, but whose enzymic activity is independent of Ca2+/CaM. In situ hybridization showed that OsCBK is expressed in reproductive and vegetative tissues of rice and shows temporal and spatial changes during plant growth and development. OsCBK is highly expressed in zones of cell division and it is particularly abundant in sporogenous cells of the anther at meiosis.
14730075	A novel family of transporters mediating the transport of glutathione derivatives in plants.	2004	Plant Physiol	Uptake and compartmentation of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and glutathione conjugates are important for many functions including sulfur transport, resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, and developmental processes. Complementation of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant (hgt1) deficient in glutathione transport was used to characterize a glutathione transporter cDNA (OsGT1) from rice (Oryza sativa). The 2.58-kb full-length cDNA (AF393848, gi 27497095), which was obtained by screening of a cDNA library and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction, contains an open reading frame encoding a 766-amino acid protein. Complementation of the hgt1 yeast mutant strain with the OsGT1 cDNA restored growth on a medium containing GSH as the sole sulfur source. The strain expressing OsGT1 mediated [3H]GSH uptake, and this uptake was significantly competed not only by unlabeled GSSG and GS conjugates but also by some amino acids and peptides, suggesting a wide substrate specificity. OsGT1 may be involved in the retrieval of GSSG, GS conjugates, and nitrogen-containing peptides from the cell wall.
16255173	Cloning and biochemical properties of CDPK gene OsCDPK14 from rice.	2005	J Plant Physiol	A rice CDPK gene, OsCDPK14 (AY144497), was cloned from developing caryopses of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Zhonghua 15). Its cDNA sequence (1922 bp) contains an ORF encoding a 514 amino acids protein (56.7kD, pl 5.18). OsCDPK14 shows the typical structural features of the CDPK family, including a conserved catalytic Ser/Thr kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain and a CaM-like domain with four putative Ca2+-binding EF hands. Subcellular targeting indicated that OsCDPK14 was located in the cytoplasm, probably due to the absence of myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs. OsCDPK14 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from bacterial extracts. The recombinant protein was shown to be a functional protein kinase using Syntide-2, a synthetic peptide. Kinase activity was shown to be Ca2+-dependent, and this activation was strongly enhanced by Mn2+ and inhibited by W7 in vitro. These results provide significant insights into the regulation and biochemical properties of OsCDPK14, suggesting OsCDPK14 may be a signal factor of cytoplasm in rice plant.
1347144	Characterization and genetic mapping of a short, highly repeated, interspersed DNA sequence from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1992	Mol Gen Genet	A short, highly repeated, interspersed DNA sequence from rice was characterized using a combination of techniques and genetically mapped to rice chromosomes by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. A consensus sequence (GGC)n, where n varies from 13-16, for the repeated sequence family was deduced from sequence analysis. Southern blot analysis, restriction mapping of repeat element-containing genomic clones, and DNA sequence analysis indicated that the repeated sequence is interspersed in the rice genome, and is heterogeneous and divergent. About 200,000 copies are present in the rice genome. Single copy sequences flanking the repeat element were used as RFLP markers to map individual repeat elements. Eleven such repeat elements were mapped to seven different chromosomes. The strategy for characterization of highly dispersed repeated DNA and its uses in genetic mapping, DNA fingerprinting, and evolutionary studies are discussed.

8142020	5'-flanking region responsible for endosperm-specific expression of rice prolamine chimeric gene in transgenic tobacco.	1993	Sci China B	The 5' upstream region (-680-(+)40) containing the complete signal peptide coding sequence of the rice seed storage prolamine gene was amplified in vitro with polymerase chain reaction from the genome of Chinese super rice cultivar Zhonghua 8. Physical map and DNA sequence analysis showed strong homology with the 5'-flanking region of rice prolamine gene reported by Kim in 1988. No changes in the signal peptide coding sequence and a long leader sequence with several small ORFs were found. Chimeric gene containing 5'-flanking region of the prolamine gene has been transcriptionally fused with the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. The fusion junction was confirmed by both physical map and DNA sequence analysis. The resultant chimeric gene was used to transform the tobacco explants by Ti binary system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404. With dot and Southern blotting hybridization, three transgenic tobacco plants with the copies of chimeric GUS genes as many as 20 were obtained. Histochemical analysis revealed that the GUS activity in the endosperm tissues of tobacco seeds at the developmental stage was about 20 DAP. No GUS activity was found in leaves, stems, roots and flowers of the transgenic tobacco plants. Therefore, we concluded that the 5'-upstream cis-elements from -680 to -18 were enough to confer the endosperm-specific and temporal expression of rice prolamine gene.
8877110	High level expression of oryzacystatin in Escherichia coli.	1996	Chin J Biotechnol	A rice cDNA library of immature seeds has already been constructed, from which colonies carrying oryzacystatin cDNA were isolated. The coding region of the oryzacystatin (a thiol proteinase inhibitor) gene was amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and inserted downstream of lambdaPRPL promoter of E. coli thermal-inducible expression vector pBV220. An oryzacystatin expression plasmid pBVC9 was therefore obtained. Shifting the culture temperature of E. coli DH5 alpha (pBVC9) from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C led to a high level expression of oryzacystatin. The result of SDS-PAGE showed a distinct band of 12.0 kDa which accounts for at least 10% of the total soluble proteins. The inhibitory activity of the total soluble proteins of E. coli DH5 alpha (pBVC9) toward papain was confirmed by using that of E. coli DH5 alpha (pBV220) as a control.
15948847	Phylogenetic relationships among A-genome species of the genus Oryza revealed by intron sequences of four nuclear genes.	2005	New Phytol	The A-genome group in Oryza consists of eight diploid species and is distributed world-wide. Here we reconstructed the phylogeny among the A-genome species based on sequences of nuclear genes and MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements) insertions. Thirty-seven accessions representing two cultivated and six wild species from the A-genome group were sampled. Introns of four nuclear single-copy genes on different chromosomes were sequenced and analysed by both maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference methods. All the species except for Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara formed a monophyletic group and the Australian endemic Oryza meridionalis was the earliest divergent lineage. Two subspecies of Oryza sativa (ssp. indica and ssp. japonica) formed two separate monophyletic groups, suggestive of their polyphyletic origin. Based on molecular clock approach, we estimated that the divergence of the A-genome group occurred c. 2.0 million years ago (mya) while the two subspecies (indica and japonica) separated c. 0.4 mya. Intron sequences of nuclear genes provide sufficient resolution and are informative for phylogenetic inference at lower taxonomic levels.
8534851	Cloning and properties of a rice gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genomic sequences were isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic library using a PCR-amplified rice PAL DNA fragment as a probe. There is a small family of PAL genes in the rice genome. The nucleotide sequence of one PAL gene, ZB8, was determined. The ZB8 gene is 4660 bp in length and consists of two exons and one intron. It encodes a polypeptide of 710 amino acids. The transcription start site was 137 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. Rice PAL transcripts accumulated to a high level in stems, with lower levels in roots and leaves. Wounding of leaf tissues induced ZB8 PAL transcripts to a high level. In rice suspension-cultured cells treated with fungal cell wall elicitors, the ZB8 PAL transcript increased within 30 min and reached maximum levels in 1-2 h. The transcription of the ZB8 gene was investigated by fusing its promoter to the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and transforming the construct into rice and tobacco plants, as well as rice suspension-cultured cells. High levels of GUS activity were observed in stems, moderate levels in roots and low levels in leaves of transgenic rice and tobacco plants. Histochemical analysis indicated that in transgenic rice the promoter was active in root apical tips, lateral root initiation sites, and vascular and epidermal tissues of stems and roots. In rice flowers, high GUS activity was observed in floral shoots, receptacles, anthers and filaments, occasionally GUS activity was also detected in lemma and awn tissues. In tobacco flowers, high GUS activity was detected in the pink part of petals. Consistent with the activity of endogenous PAL transcripts, wounding of rice and tobacco leaf tissues induced GUS activity from low basal levels. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection of tobacco leaves induced GUS activity to a high level. Fungal cell wall elicitors strongly induced GUS activity and GUS transcripts to high levels in transgenic rice suspension-cultured cells. We demonstrated that the promoter of ZB8 gene is both developmentally regulated and stress-inducible.
11971135	Rice TATA binding protein interacts functionally with transcription factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP transcriptional activator in an enhanced plant in vitro transcription system.	2002	Plant Cell	TATA binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) are key factors for the assembly of eukaryotic transcription initiation complexes. We used a rice whole-cell extract in vitro transcription system to characterize the functional interactions of recombinant plant TBP and TFIIB. Bacterially expressed rice TBP (OsTBP2) bound to the TATA box of the rice pal gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, caused DNA bending, and enhanced basal transcription from the pal promoter in a TATA box-dependent manner. Recombinant rice TFIIB (OsTFIIB) stimulated the DNA binding and bending activities of OsTBP2 and synergistically enhanced OsTBP2-mediated transcription from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus but not from the barley pr1 promoter. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP2 and RF2a, a rice bZIP transcription factor that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter. Enhancement of rice whole-cell extracts with recombinant transcription factors thus provides a powerful tool for the in vitro determination of plant gene regulation mechanisms. We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a.
16299167	The rice dwarf virus P2 protein interacts with ent-kaurene oxidases in vivo, leading to reduced biosynthesis of gibberellins and rice dwarf symptoms.	2005	Plant Physiol	The mechanisms of viral diseases are a major focus of biology. Despite intensive investigations, how a plant virus interacts with host factors to cause diseases remains poorly understood. The Rice dwarf virus (RDV), a member of the genus Phytoreovirus, causes dwarfed growth phenotypes in infected rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The outer capsid protein P2 is essential during RDV infection of insects and thus influences transmission of RDV by the insect vector. However, its role during RDV infection within the rice host is unknown. By yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we report that P2 of RDV interacts with ent-kaurene oxidases, which play a key role in the biosynthesis of plant growth hormones gibberellins, in infected plants. Furthermore, the expression of ent-kaurene oxidases was reduced in the infected plants. The level of endogenous GA1 (a major active gibberellin in rice vegetative tissues) in the RDV-infected plants was lower than that in healthy plants. Exogenous application of GA3 to RDV-infected rice plants restored the normal growth phenotypes. These results provide evidence that the P2 protein of RDV interferes with the function of a cellular factor, through direct physical interactions, that is important for the biosynthesis of a growth hormone leading to symptom expression. In addition, the interaction between P2 and rice ent-kaurene oxidase-like proteins may decrease phytoalexin biosynthesis and make plants more competent for virus replication. Moreover, P2 may provide a novel tool to investigate the regulation of GA metabolism for plant growth and development.
12947109	An interaction between a MYC protein and an EREBP protein is involved in transcriptional regulation of the rice Wx gene.	2003	J Biol Chem	We previously demonstrated that a 31-bp nucleotide sequence located upstream of the rice Wx gene played an important role in its expression. We further showed that this cis-acting regulator interacts with nuclear proteins extracted from developing rice endosperm. We used the 31-bp sequence as bait in a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate several cDNA clones from a rice cDNA expression library. One of these cDNAs encodes a MYC protein, designated OsBP-5, which is 335 amino acids long and contains a putative basic helix-loop-helix-ZIP DNA-binding domain. This domain exhibits 50% amino acid sequence identity with the R/B proteins that regulate the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Southwestern gel blots indicate that this protein binds specifically to the CAACGTG motif within the 31-bp sequence. However, by itself, the OsBP-5 protein is unable to trans-activate a lacZ reporter gene controlled by the 31-bp sequence when tested in a yeast expression system. Interestingly, OsBP-5 can trans-activate this reporter gene when another protein, OsEBP-89, a member of the EREBP family of transcription factors, is present. Furthermore, in vitro pull-down experiments show that a protein isolated from developing rice endosperm interacts with the OsBP-5 protein, and Western blots confirm that the interacting protein is OsEBP-89. The formation of a supershift band in EMSAs also indicates that two proteins interact with each other. Interference of OsBP-5 gene expression by double-stranded RNA reduces the amylose content in mature seed of transgenic rice plants but has no visible effect on their phenotype. These results suggest that the OsBP-5 and OsEBP-89 proteins act synergistically, perhaps as a heterodimer, to regulate the transcription of the rice Wx gene.

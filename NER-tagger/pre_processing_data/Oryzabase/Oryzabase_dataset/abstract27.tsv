22429711	The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity.	2012	Plant J	When the gibberellin (GA) receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) binds to GA, GID1 interacts with DELLA proteins, repressors of GA signaling. This interaction inhibits the suppressive function of DELLA protein and thereby activates the GA response. However, how DELLA proteins exert their suppressive function and how GID1s inhibit suppressive function of DELLA proteins is unclear. By yeast one-hybrid experiments and transient expression of the N-terminal region of rice DELLA protein (SLR1) in rice callus, we established that the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 possesses transactivation activity. When SLR1 proteins with various deletions were over-expressed in rice, the severity of dwarfism correlated with the transactivation activity observed in yeast, indicating that SLR1 suppresses plant growth through transactivation activity. This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA. The C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 also exhibits a suppressive function on plant growth, possibly by directly or indirectly interacting with the promoter region of target genes. Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of SLR1 has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with GID1 and transactivation activity.
22419825	Efficacy of microarray profiling data combined with QTL mapping for the identification of a QTL gene controlling the initial growth rate in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Seedling vigor, which is controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), is one of several important agronomic traits for direct-seedling rice systems. However, isolating these QTL genes is laborious and expensive. Here, we combined QTL mapping and microarray profiling to identify QTL genes for seedling vigor. By performing QTL mapping using 82 backcross inbred lines (BILs) of the Koshihikari (japonica) and Habataki (indica) cultivars for the rice initial growth, we identified two QTLs, early-stage plant development1/2 (qEPD1 and qEPD2), whose Koshihikari alleles promote plant height and/or leaf sheath length. Phenotypic analysis of the two substituted lines carrying the Habataki qEPD1 or qEPD2 allele revealed that qEPD2 functioned more dominantly for the initial growth of rice. From the microarray experiment, 55 and 45 candidate genes were found in the qEPD1 and qEPD2 genomic regions, which are expressed differentially between each substitution line (SL) and Koshihikari. Gibberellin 20 oxidase-2 (OsGA20ox2), which is identical to Semi Dwarf1 (SD1), was included among the 55 candidate genes of qEPD1, whereas its paralog, OsGA20ox1, was included among the 45 candidate genes of qEPD2. Consistently, introduction of the Koshihikari OsGA20ox1 allele into SL(qEPD2) increaseed its plant height and leaf sheath length significantly relative to the introduction of the Habataki OsGA20ox1 allele. Therefore, microarray profiling could be useful for rapidly screening QTL candidate genes. We concluded that OsGA20ox1 and OsGA20ox2 (SD1) function during the initial growth of rice, but OsGA20ox1 plays a dominant role in increasing plant height and leaf sheath length at the initial growth stage.
21952207	Heading date 1 (Hd1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS, is a possible target of human selection during domestication to diversify flowering times of cultivated rice.	2011	Genes Genet Syst	During the domestication of rice (Oryza sativa L.), diversification of flowering time was important in expanding the areas of cultivation. Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant and requires certain periods of dark to induce flowering. Heading date 1 (Hd1), a regulator of the florigen gene Hd3a, is one of the main factors used to generate diversity in flowering. Loss-of-function alleles of Hd1 are common in cultivated rice and cause the diversity of flowering time. However, it is unclear how these functional nucleotide polymorphisms of Hd1 accumulated in the course of evolution. Nucleotide polymorphisms within Hd1 and Hd3a were analyzed in 38 accessions of ancestral wild rice Oryza rufipogon and compared with those of cultivated rice. In contrast to cultivated rice, no nucleotide changes affecting Hd1 function were found in 38 accessions of wild rice ancestors. No functional changes were found in Hd3a in either cultivated or ancestral rice. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the Hd1 alleles may have occurred independently in cultivars descended from various accessions of ancestral rice. The non-functional Hd1 alleles found in cultivated rice may be selected during domestication, because they were not found or very rare in wild ancestral rice. In contrast with Hd3a, which has been highly conserved, Hd1 may have undergone human selection to diversify the flowering times of rice during domestication or the early stage of the cultivation period.
22574770	DWARF50 (D50), a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, is required for proper development of intercalary meristem.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Rice internodes are vital for supporting high-yield panicles, which are controlled by various factors such as cell division, cell elongation and cell wall biosynthesis. Therefore, formation and regulation of the internode cell-producing intercalary meristem (IM) are important for determining the shape of internodes. To understand the regulation of internode development, we analysed a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf 50 (d50). Previously, we reported that parenchyma cells in the elongated internodes of d50 ectopically deposit cell wall phenolics. In this study, we revealed that D50 encodes putative inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase), which may be involved in phosphoinositide signalling required for many essential cellular functions, such as cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis and vesicular trafficking in eukaryotes. Analysis of the rice genome revealed 20 putative 5PTases including D50. The d50 mutation induced abnormally oriented cell division, irregular deposition of cell wall pectins and thick actin bundles in the parenchyma cells of the IM, resulting in abnormally organized cell files of the internode parenchyma and dwarf phenotype. Our results suggest that the putative 5PTase, encoded by D50, is essential for IM formation, including the direction of cell division, deposition of cell wall pectins and control of actin organization.
22476293	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway.	2012	Planta	Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence. They encode a cytochrome P450 protein CYP78A11 and an RNA-binding protein, respectively. Their homologs in Arabidopsis and maize are also associated with plant development/organ size. Despite the importance of PLA genes in plant development, their molecular functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated how PLA1 and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones. We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and PLA2 expression. GA induced PLA1 and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and PLA2 expression. In pla1-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings. GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and pla2. To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined. In GA-insensitive mutant, gid1 and less-sensitive mutant, Slr1-d1, PLA1 and PLA2 expression was down-regulated. On the other hand, the expression levels of PLA1 and PLA2 were highly enhanced in a GA-constitutive-active mutant, slr1-1, causing ectopic overexpression. These results indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.
22889403	Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway.	2012	Plant J	Phyllotaxy is defined as the spatial arrangement of leaves on the stem. The mechanism responsible for this extremely regular pattern is one of the most fascinating enigmas in plant biology. In this study, we identified a gene regulating the phyllotactic pattern in rice. Loss-of-function mutants of the DECUSSATE (DEC) gene displayed a phyllotactic conversion from normal distichous pattern to decussate. The dec mutants had an enlarged shoot apical meristem with enhanced cell division activity. In contrast to the shoot apical meristem, the size of the root apical meristem in the dec mutants was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed. These phenotypes indicate that DEC has opposite functions in the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem. Map-based cloning revealed that DEC encodes a plant-specific protein containing a glutamine-rich region and a conserved motif. Although its molecular function is unclear, the conserved domain is shared with fungi and animals. Expression analysis showed that several type A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin signaling pathway were down-regulated in the dec mutant. In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous cytokinin. Our results suggest that DEC controls the phyllotactic pattern by affecting cytokinin signaling in rice.
21338950	RLIN1, encoding a putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, is involved in lesion initiation in rice.	2011	J Genet Genomics	Lesion mimic is necrotic lesions on plant leaf or stem in the absence of pathogenic infection, and its exact biological mechanism is varied. By a large-scale screening of our T-DNA mutant population, we identified a mutant rice lesion initiation 1 (rlin1), which was controlled by a single nuclear recessive gene. Map-based cloning revealed that RLIN1 encoded a putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Sequencing results showed that a G to T substitution occurred in the second exon of RLIN1 and led to a missense mutation from Asp to Tyr. Ectopic expression of RLIN1 could rescue rlin1 lesion mimic phenotype. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that lesion formation in rlin1 was light-dependent accompanied by reactive oxygen species accumulated. These results suggest that tetrapyrrole participates in lesion formation in rice.
21793954	Rice 14-3-3 protein (GF14e) negatively affects cell death and disease resistance.	2011	Plant J	Plant 14-3-3 proteins regulate important cellular processes, including plant immune responses, through protein-protein interactions with a wide range of target proteins. In rice (Oryza sativa), the GF14e gene, which encodes a 14-3-3 protein, is induced during effector-triggered immunity (ETI) associated with pathogens such as Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To determine whether the GF14e gene plays a direct role in resistance to disease in rice, we suppressed its expression by RNAi silencing. GF14e suppression was correlated with the appearance of a lesion-mimic (LM) phenotype in the transgenic plants at 3 weeks after sowing. This indicates inappropriate regulation of cell death, a phenotype that is frequently associated with enhanced resistance to pathogens. GF14e-silenced rice plants showed high levels of resistance to a virulent strain of Xoo compared with plants that were not silenced. Enhanced resistance was correlated with GF14e silencing prior to and after development of the LM phenotype, higher basal expression of a defense response peroxidase gene (POX22.3), and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, GF14e-silenced plants also exhibit enhanced resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Together, our findings suggest that GF14e negatively affects the induction of plant defense response genes, cell death and broad-spectrum resistance in rice.
22369597	In-depth molecular and phenotypic characterization in a rice insertion line library facilitates gene identification through reverse and forward genetics approaches.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	We report here the molecular and phenotypic features of a library of 31,562 insertion lines generated in the model japonica cultivar Nipponbare of rice (Oryza sativa L.), called Oryza Tag Line (OTL). Sixteen thousand eight hundred and fourteen T-DNA and 12,410 Tos17 discrete insertion sites have been characterized in these lines. We estimate that 8686 predicted gene intervals--i.e. one-fourth to one-fifth of the estimated rice nontransposable element gene complement--are interrupted by sequence-indexed T-DNA (6563 genes) and/or Tos17 (2755 genes) inserts. Six hundred and forty-three genes are interrupted by both T-DNA and Tos17 inserts. High quality of the sequence indexation of the T2 seed samples was ascertained by several approaches. Field evaluation under agronomic conditions of 27,832 OTL has revealed that 18.2% exhibit at least one morphophysiological alteration in the T1 progeny plants. Screening 10,000 lines for altered response to inoculation by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae allowed to observe 71 lines (0.7%) developing spontaneous lesions simulating disease mutants and 43 lines (0.4%) exhibiting an enhanced disease resistance or susceptibility. We show here that at least 3.5% (four of 114) of these alterations are tagged by the mutagens. The presence of allelic series of sequence-indexed mutations in a gene among OTL that exhibit a convergent phenotype clearly increases the chance of establishing a linkage between alterations and inserts. This convergence approach is illustrated by the identification of the rice ortholog of AtPHO2, the disruption of which causes a lesion-mimic phenotype owing to an over-accumulation of phosphate, in nine lines bearing allelic insertions.
22388489	Loss of Cellulose synthase-like F6 function affects mixed-linkage glucan deposition, cell wall mechanical properties, and defense responses in vegetative tissues of rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a cell wall polysaccharide containing a backbone of unbranched (1,3)- and (1,4)-linked β-glucosyl residues. Based on its occurrence in plants and chemical characteristics, MLG has primarily been associated with the regulation of cell wall expansion due to its high and transient accumulation in young, expanding tissues. The Cellulose synthase-like F (CslF) subfamily of glycosyltransferases has previously been implicated in mediating the biosynthesis of this polymer. We confirmed that the rice (Oryza sativa) CslF6 gene mediates the biosynthesis of MLG by overexpressing it in Nicotiana benthamiana. Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development. However, cslf6 mutants display a drastic decrease in MLG content (97% reduction in coleoptiles and virtually undetectable in other tissues). Immunodetection with an anti-MLG monoclonal antibody revealed that the coleoptiles and leaves retain trace amounts of MLG only in specific cell types such as sclerenchyma fibers. These results correlate with the absence of endogenous MLG synthase activity in mutant seedlings and 4-week-old sheaths. Mutant cell walls are weaker in mature stems but not seedlings, and more brittle in both stems and seedlings, compared to wild type. Mutants also display lesion mimic phenotypes in leaves, which correlates with enhanced defense-related gene expression and enhanced disease resistance. Taken together, our results underline a weaker role of MLG in cell expansion than previously thought, and highlight a structural role for MLG in nonexpanding, mature stem tissues in rice.
8650152	A new hemoglobin gene from soybean: a role for hemoglobin in all plants.	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We have isolated a new hemoglobin gene from soybean. It is expressed in cotyledons, stems of seedlings, roots, young leaves, and in some cells in the nodules that are associated with the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium symbiont. This contrasts with the expression of the leghemoglobins, which are active only in the infected cells of the nodules. The deduced protein sequence of the new gene shows only 58% similarity to one of the soybean leghemoglobins, but 85-87% similarity to hemoglobins from the nonlegumes Parasponia, Casuarina, and barley. The pattern of expression and the gene sequence indicate that this new gene is a nonsymbiotic legume hemoglobin. The finding of this gene in legumes and similar genes in other species strengthens our previous suggestion that genomes of all plants contain hemoglobin genes. The specialized leghemoglobin gene family may have arisen from a preexisting nonsymbiotic hemoglobin by gene duplication.
22142166	SWAP70 functions as a Rac/Rop guanine nucleotide-exchange factor in rice.	2012	Plant J	Rho family small GTPases are involved in diverse signaling processes including immunity, growth, and development. The activity of Rho GTPases is regulated by cycling between guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound inactive and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound active forms, in which guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) predominantly function to promote activation of the GTPases. In animals, most Rho GEFs possess a Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma) homology (DH) domain which functions as a GEF-catalytic domain. However, no proteins with the DH domain have been identified in plants so far. Instead, plant-specific Rho GEFs with the PRONE domain responsible for GEF activity have been found to constitute a large family in plants. In this study, we found rice homologs of human SWAP70, Oryza sativa (Os) SWAP70A and SWAP70B, containing the DH domain. OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses. The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF-catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains. Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1-mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta. Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor-induced defense gene expression and ROS production. Thus, it is likely that OsSWAP70 regulates immune responses through activation of OsRac1.
18931976	Expression profiling of rice cultivars differing in their tolerance to long-term drought stress.	2009	Plant Mol Biol	Understanding the molecular basis of plant performance under water-limiting conditions will help to breed crop plants with a lower water demand. We investigated the physiological and gene expression response of drought-tolerant (IR57311 and LC-93-4) and drought-sensitive (Nipponbare and Taipei 309) rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars to 18 days of drought stress in climate chamber experiments. Drought stressed plants grew significantly slower than the controls. Gene expression profiles were measured in leaf samples with the 20 K NSF oligonucleotide microarray. A linear model was fitted to the data to identify genes that were significantly regulated under drought stress. In all drought stressed cultivars, 245 genes were significantly repressed and 413 genes induced. Genes differing in their expression pattern under drought stress between tolerant and sensitive cultivars were identified by the genotype x environment (G x E) interaction term. More genes were significantly drought regulated in the sensitive than in the tolerant cultivars. Localizing all expressed genes on the rice genome map, we checked which genes with a significant G x E interaction co-localized with published quantitative trait loci regions for drought tolerance. These genes are more likely to be important for drought tolerance in an agricultural environment. To identify the metabolic processes with a significant G x E effect, we adapted the analysis software MapMan for rice. We found a drought stress induced shift toward senescence related degradation processes that was more pronounced in the sensitive than in the tolerant cultivars. In spite of higher growth rates and water use, more photosynthesis related genes were down-regulated in the tolerant than in the sensitive cultivars.
20091079	A candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion.	2010	Funct Integr Genomics	A dwarf mutant (Oryza sativa anaphase-promoting complex 6 (OsAPC6)) of rice cultivar Basmati 370 with 50% reduced plant height as compared to the wild type was isolated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using Hm(R) Ds cassette. This mutant was found to be insensitive to exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)) application. Homozygous mutant plants showed incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity for plant height and pleiotropic effects including gibberellic acid insensitivity, reduced seed size, panicle length, and female fertility. Single copy insertion of T-DNA and its association with OsAPC6 was confirmed by Southern hybridization, germination on hygromycin, and 3:1 segregation of HPT gene in F(2) from OsAPC6 x Basmati 370 cross. The T-DNA flanking region sequenced through thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction showed a single hit on chromosome 3 of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare in the second exonic region of a gene which encodes for sixth subunit of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. The candidate gene of 8.6-kb length encodes a 728-amino acid protein containing a conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and has only a paralog, isopenicillin N-synthase family protein on the same chromosome without the TPR domain. There was no expression of the gene in the mutant while in Basmati 370, it was equal in both roots and shoots. The knockout mutant OsAPC6 interferes with the gibberellic acid signaling pathway leading to reduced height and cell size probably through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Further functional validation of the gene through RNAi is in progress.
12559953	Molecular cloning and mRNA expression analysis of a novel rice (Oryzasativa L.) MAPK kinase kinase, OsEDR1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtEDR1, reveal its role in defense/stress signalling pathways and development.	2003	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade(s) is important for plant defense/stress responses. Though MAPKs have been identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot cereal crop research model, the first upstream component of the kinase cascade, namely MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) has not yet been identified. Here we report the cloning of a novel rice gene encoding a MAPKKK, OsEDR1, designated based on its homology with the Arabidopsis MAPKKK, AtEDR1. OsEDR1, a single copy gene in the genome of rice, encodes a predicted protein with molecular mass of 113046.13 and a pI of 9.03. Using our established two-week-old rice seedling in vitro model system, we show that OsEDR1 has a constitutive expression in seedling leaves and is further up-regulated within 15 min upon wounding by cut, treatment with the global signals jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ethephon, ET), abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. In addition, protein phosphatase inhibitors, fungal elicitor chitosan, drought, high salt and sugar, and heavy metals also dramatically induce its expression. Moreover, OsEDR1 expression was altered by co-application of JA, SA, and ET, and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation. Furthermore, using an in vivo system we also show that OsEDR1 responds to changes in temperature and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide. Finally, OsEDR1 expression varied significantly in vegetative and reproductive tissues. These results suggest a role for OsEDR1 in defense/stress signalling pathways and development.
19904499	Rice OsACDR1 (Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1) is a potential positive regulator of fungal disease resistance.	2009	Mol Cells	Rice Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1 (OsACDR1) encodes a putative Raf-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). We had previously reported upregulation of the OsACDR1 transcript by a range of environmental stimuli involved in eliciting defense-related pathways. Here we apply biochemical, gain and loss-of-function approaches to characterize OsACDR1 function in rice. The OsACDR1 protein showed autophosphorylation and possessed kinase activity. Rice plants overexpressing OsACDR1 exhibited spontaneous hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on leaves, upregulation of defense-related marker genes and accumulation of phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites (phytoalexins). These transgenic plants also acquired enhanced resistance to a fungal pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) and showed inhibition of appressorial penetration on the leaf surface. In contrast, loss-offunction and RNA silenced OsACDR1 rice mutant plants showed downregulation of defense-related marker genes expressions and susceptibility to M. grisea. Furthermore, transient expression of an OsACDR1:GFP fusion protein in rice protoplast and onion epidermal cells revealed its localization to the nucleus. These results indicate that OsACDR1 plays an important role in the positive regulation of disease resistance in rice.
15749763	The critical role of disulfide bond formation in protein sorting in the endosperm of rice.	2005	Plant Cell	Many seed storage proteins, including monomeric 2S albumin and polymeric prolamin, contain conserved sequences in three separate regions, termed A, B, and C, which contain the consensus motifs LxxC, CCxQL, and PxxC, respectively. Protein-sorting mechanisms in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm were studied with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to different segments of rice alpha-globulin, a monomeric, ABC-containing storage protein. The whole ABC region together with GFP was efficiently transported to protein storage vacuoles (type II protein bodies [PB-II]) in the endosperm cells and sequestered in the matrix that surrounds the crystalloids. Peptide Gln-23 to Ser-43 in the A region was sufficient to guide GFP to PB-II. However, GFP fused with the AB or B region accumulated in prolamin protein bodies. Substitution mutations in the CCxQL motif in the B region significantly altered protein localization in the endosperm cells. Furthermore, protein extracts containing these substituted proteins had increased amounts of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperons BiP (for binding protein), protein disulfide isomerase, and calnexin as a part of protein complexes that were insoluble in a detergent buffer. These results suggest that the ER chaperons and disulfide bonds formed at the dicysteine residues in CCxQL play critical roles in sorting fused proteins in the endosperm cells.
11272832	Characterization of PBZ1, a probenazole-inducible gene, in suspension-cultured rice cells.	2001	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Probenazole (PBZ) induces non-race specific resistance in rice plants against rice blast fungus and PBZ1 was identified as a PBZ-inducible gene from rice. The induction of PBZ1 expression in suspension-cultured rice cells was investigated. Northern blot analysis indicated that PBZ1 was induced by PBZ in a dose-dependent manner. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed a dose and time-dependent accumulation of PBZ1 protein. Both mRNA and protein analysis showed that PBZ1 was not induced by salicylic acid or an active metabolite, 1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide.
19129653	Phosphocholine-containing glycosyl inositol-phosphoceramides from Trichoderma viride induce defense responses in cultured rice cells.	2009	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We isolated two major zwitterionic glycosphingolipids (ZGLs) from the phytopathogenic filamentous fungus Trichoderma viride. Structural analyses showed that the ZGLs (designated Tv-ZGL2 and Tv-ZGL3) were the same as the glycosphingolipids ZGL2 and ZGL4 from Acremonium sp., which are described in our previous paper. ZGLs have the following structure: Man(alpha1-6)GlcN(alpha1-2)Ins-P-Cer (Tv-ZGL2) and phosphocholine (PC)-->6Man(alpha1-6)GlcN(alpha1-2)Ins-P-Cer (Tv-ZGL3). To determine whether these ZGLs have functional roles in plant-fungus interaction, we tested to determine whether they would induce defense responses in cultured rice cells. We found that T. viride's ZGLs elicited expression of the PAL and PBZ1 genes, both of which are associated with pathogen resistance. Tv-ZGL2 induced cell death at a moderate rate. Tv-ZGL3, which contains a PC moiety, induced a high level of cell death in rice cells.
19966496	Effects of colonization of a bacterial endophyte, Azospirillum sp. B510, on disease resistance in rice.	2009	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Agriculturally important grasses contain numerous diazotrophic bacteria, the interactions of which are speculated to have some other benefits to the host plants. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a bacterial endophyte, Azospirillum sp. B510, on disease resistance in host rice plants. Rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were inoculated with B510 exhibited enhanced resistance against diseases caused by the virulent rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and by the virulent bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. In the rice plants, neither salicylic acid (SA) accumulation nor expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes was induced by interaction with this bacterium, except for slight induction of PBZ1. These results indicate the possibility that strain B510 is able to induce disease resistance in rice by activating a novel type of resistance mechanism independent of SA-mediated defense signaling.
12744513	Flagellin from an incompatible strain of Acidovorax avenae mediates H2O2 generation accompanying hypersensitive cell death and expression of PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1, but not of Lox in rice.	2003	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Acidovorax avenae causes a brown stripe disease in monocot plants. We recently reported that a rice-incompatible strain of A. avenae caused hypersensitive cell death in rice and that the flagellin of the incompatible strain was involved in this response. The incompatible strain induced the rapid generation of H2O2 accompanying hypersensitive cell death and the expression of defense genes such as PAL, Cht-1, PBZ1, and LOX, whereas the compatible strain did not. The purified incompatible flagellin also induced the expression of PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1, but LOX expression was not induced by the incompatible flagellin. PAL and LOX enzymatic activities were increased by inoculation with the incompatible strain, whereas only PAL activity was increased by the incompatible flagellin. Interestingly, the flagellin-deficient incompatible strain lost the ability to generate H2O2 and induce hypersensitive cell death, but PAL, Cht-1, and PBZ1 expression still were induced by inoculation with the deficient strain, suggesting that induction of these genes is regulated not only by flagellin but also by some other signal. Thus, the incompatible flagellin of A. avenae is a specific elicitor in rice, but it is not the only factor capable of inducing the rice defense system.
11437261	Characterization of a PR-10 pathogenesis-related gene family induced in rice during infection with Magnaporthe grisea.	2001	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	A partial cDNA with homology to the PR-10 class of pathogenesis-related proteins was used to screen a rice genomic library. One 16-kb genomic clone contained three genes with PR-10 similarity. These genes, RPR10a, RPR10b, and RPR10c, were arranged in tandem and separated by approximately 2.5 kb. RPR10a cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis revealed that RPR10a and RPR10b encode predicted proteins of 158 and 160 amino acids, respectively, and share 71% amino acid identity. RPR10c appears to be a nonfunctional pseudogene. Gene-specific probes were used to study transcript accumulations of the three RPR10 genes in rice plants following inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea. RPR10a transcripts were induced from a low basal level within 12 h after inoculation and showed a second higher level induction at 48 h, which continued throughout the 144 h it was examined. In addition, RPR10a was induced strongly by salicylic and jasmonic acid applications to rice plants. Transcripts of RPR10b also were enhanced by M. grisea, but were not strongly visible until 48 h after inoculation. Tissue prints of M. grisea-infected rice leaves when the RPR10a-specific probe was used indicate that RPR10a is expressed most strongly in a localized fashion in response to the pathogen.
16673937	Upregulation of jasmonate-inducible defense proteins and differential colonization of roots of Oryza sativa cultivars with the endophyte Azoarcus sp.	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 expresses nitrogenase (nif) genes inside rice roots. We applied a proteomic approach to dissect responses of rice roots toward bacterial colonization and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Two sister lineages of Oryza sativa were analyzed with cv. IR42 showing a less compatible interaction with the Azoarcus sp. resulting in slight root browning whereas cv. IR36 was successfully colonized as determined by nifHi::gusA activity. External addition of JA inhibited colonization of roots and caused browning in contrast to the addition of ethylene, applied as ethephon (up to 5 mM). Only two of the proteins induced in cv. IR36 by JA were also induced by the endophyte (SalT, two isoforms). In contrast, seven JA-induced proteins were also induced by bacteria in cv. IR42, indicating that IR42 showed a stronger defense response. Mass spectrometry analysis identified these proteins as pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Prb1, RSOsPR10) or proteins sharing domains with receptorlike kinases induced by pathogens. Proteins strongly induced in roots in both varieties by JA were identified as Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibittors, germinlike protein, putative endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase, glutathion-S-transferase, and 1-propane-1-carboxylate oxidase synthase, peroxidase precursor, PR10-a, and a RAN protein previously not found to be JA-induced. Data suggest that plant defense responses involving JA may contribute to restricting endophytic colonization in grasses. Remarkably, in a compatible interaction with endophytes, JA-inducible stress or defense responses are apparently not important.
22215597	Glycosyl transferases in family 61 mediate arabinofuranosyl transfer onto xylan in grasses.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Xylan, a hemicellulosic component of the plant cell wall, is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in nature. In contrast to dicots, xylan in grasses is extensively modified by α-(1,2)- and α-(1,3)-linked arabinofuranose. Despite the importance of grass arabinoxylan in human and animal nutrition and for bioenergy, the enzymes adding the arabinosyl substitutions are unknown. Here we demonstrate that knocking-down glycosyltransferase (GT) 61 expression in wheat endosperm strongly decreases α-(1,3)-linked arabinosyl substitution of xylan. Moreover, heterologous expression of wheat and rice GT61s in Arabidopsis leads to arabinosylation of the xylan, and therefore provides gain-of-function evidence for α-(1,3)-arabinosyltransferase activity. Thus, GT61 proteins play a key role in arabinoxylan biosynthesis and therefore in the evolutionary divergence of grass cell walls.
22711282	Kinetic and phylogenetic analysis of plant polyamine uptake transporters.	2012	Planta	The rice gene Polyamine Uptake Transporter1 (PUT1) was originally identified based on its homology to the polyamine uptake transporters LmPOT1 and TcPAT12 in Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively. Here we show that five additional transporters from rice and Arabidopsis that cluster in the same clade as PUT1 all function as high affinity spermidine uptake transporters. Yeast expression assays of these genes confirmed that uptake of spermidine was minimally affected by 166 fold or greater concentrations of amino acids. Characterized polyamine transporters from both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa along with the two polyamine transporters from L. major and T. cruzi were aligned and used to generate a hidden Markov model. This model was used to identify significant matches to proteins in other angiosperms, bryophytes, chlorophyta, discicristates, excavates, stramenopiles and amoebozoa. No significant matches were identified in fungal or metazoan genomes. Phylogenic analysis showed that some sequences from the haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi, as well as sequences from oomycetes and diatoms clustered closer to sequences from plant genomes than from a homologous sequence in the red algal genome Galdieria sulphuraria, consistent with the hypothesis that these polyamine transporters were acquired by horizontal transfer from green algae. Leishmania and Trypansosoma formed a separate cluster with genes from other Discicristates and two Entamoeba species. We surmise that the genes in Entamoeba species were acquired by phagotrophy of Discicristates. In summary, phylogenetic and functional analysis has identified two clades of genes that are predictive of polyamine transport activity.
21505434	RSS1 regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice.	2011	Nat Commun	Plant growth and development are sustained by continuous cell division in the meristems, which is perturbed by various environmental stresses. For the maintenance of meristematic functions, it is essential that cell division be coordinated with cell differentiation. However, it is unknown how the proliferative activities of the meristems and the coordination between cell division and differentiation are maintained under stressful conditions. Here we show that a rice protein, RSS1, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions. These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin. RSS1 is conserved widely in plant lineages, except eudicots, suggesting that RSS1-dependent mechanisms might have been adopted in specific lineages during the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.
23041461	Molecular characterization of the rice protein RSS1 required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Post embryonic growth of plants depends on cell division activity in the shoot and root meristems, in conjunction with subsequent cell differentiation. Under environmental stress conditions, where plant growth is moderately impaired, the meristematic activity is maintained by mechanisms as yet unknown. We previously showed that the rice protein RSS1, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions. RSS1 interacts with a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), but other molecular characteristics are largely unknown. Here we show that RSS1 interacts with all the PP1 expressed in the shoot apex of rice. This interaction requires one of the conserved regions of RSS1, which is important for RSS1 function. Interestingly, the recombinant RSS1 protein is highly resistant to heat with respect to its anti-coagulability and binding activity to PP1. The features of RSS1 are reminiscent of those of inhibitor-2 of animals, although it is likely that the mode of function of RSS1 is different from that of inhibitor-2. Noticeably, RSS1 binds to PP1 under extremely high ionic strength conditions in vitro. Therefore, RSS1 possibly functions by forming a stable complex with PP1.
22984070	A killer-protector system regulates both hybrid sterility and segregation distortion in rice.	2012	Science	Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation that restricts gene flow between populations. Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two subspecies, indica and japonica; inter-subspecific hybrids are usually sterile. We show that a killer-protector system at the S5 locus encoded by three tightly linked genes [Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) to ORF5] regulates fertility in indica-japonica hybrids. During female sporogenesis, the action of ORF5+ (killer) and ORF4+ (partner) causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ORF3+ (protector) prevents ER stress and produces normal gametes, but ORF3- cannot prevent ER stress, resulting in premature programmed cell death and leads to embryo-sac abortion. Preferential transmission of ORF3+ gametes results in segregation distortion in the progeny. These results add to our understanding of differences between indica and japonica rice and may aid in rice genetic improvement.
17763868	Characterization of rice tryptophan decarboxylases and their direct involvement in serotonin biosynthesis in transgenic rice.	2007	Planta	L-Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and L-tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC) belong to a family of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylases and catalyze the conversion of tryptophan and tyrosine into tryptamine and tyramine, respectively. The rice genome has been shown to contain seven TDC or TYDC-like genes. Three of these genes for which cDNA clones were available were characterized to assign their functions using heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and rice (Oryza sativa cv. Dongjin). The purified products of two of the genes were expressed in E. coli and exhibited TDC activity, whereas the remaining gene could not be expressed in E. coli. The recombinant TDC protein with the greatest TDC activity showed a K (m) of 0.69 mM for tryptophan, and its activity was not inhibited by phenylalanine or tyrosine, indicating a high level of substrate specificity toward tryptophan. The ectopic expression of the three cDNA clones in rice led to the abundant production of the products of the encoded enzymes, tyramine and tryptamine. The overproduction of TYDC resulted in stunted growth and a lack of seed production due to tyramine accumulation, which increased as the plant aged. In contrast, transgenic plants that produced TDC showed a normal phenotype and contained 25-fold and 11-fold higher serotonin in the leaves and seeds, respectively, than the wild-type plants. The overproduction of either tyramine or serotonin was not strongly related to the enhanced synthesis of tyramine or serotonin derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine and feruloylserotonin, which are secondary metabolites that act as phytoalexins in plants.
20978800	Tyramine accumulation in rice cells caused a dwarf phenotype via reduced cell division.	2011	Planta	Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a rice tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC) exhibited a dwarf phenotype with a high level of tyramine accumulation. The height of transgenic rice was reduced on average to 35% of the wild-type height, whereas the number of tillers increased to 190% that of wild type. When judged by cellular distribution of tyramine and tyramine derivatives, the level of tyramine in soluble and insoluble fractions was higher than that of tyramine derivatives such as 4-coumaroyltyramine (CT) in the transgenic rice plants, suggesting that tyramine rather than its derivatives was a causative compound triggering the dwarf phenotype. Microscopic observation revealed that cell size in the transgenic lines was maintained, with a slightly irregular arrangement in the leaf mesophyll cells. When wild-type rice seeds were grown in the presence of tyramine, rice seedlings also showed stunted phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. When these stunted seedlings were employed to measure the degree of cellular proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, only small numbers of cells were found to retain labeled nuclei in shoot tips compared with the untreated control. These results show that the dwarf phenotype associated with tyramine accumulation in transgenic rice plants is attributable to a reduction in cell number rather than cell size. In addition, our dwarf phenotype caused by tyramine was not closely associated with known dwarf genes such as D88.
16371241	The RecQ gene family in plants.	2006	J Plant Physiol	RecQ helicases are conserved throughout all kingdoms of life regarding their overall structure and function. They are 3'-5' DNA helicases resolving different recombinogenic DNA structures. The RecQ helicases are key factors in a number of DNA repair and recombination pathways involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. In eukaryotes the number of RecQ genes and the structure of RecQ proteins vary strongly between organisms. Therefore, they have been named RecQ-like genes. Knockouts of several RecQ-like genes cause severe diseases in animals or harmful cellular phenotypes in yeast. Until now the largest number of RecQ-like genes per organism has been found in plants. Arabidopsis and rice possess seven different RecQ-like genes each. In the almost completely sequenced genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens at least five RecQ-like genes are present. One of the major present and future research aims is to define putative plant-specific functions and to assign their roles in DNA repair and recombination pathways in relation to RecQ genes from other eukaryotes. Regarding their intron positions, the structures of six RecQ-like genes of dicots and monocots are virtually identical indicating a conservation over a time scale of 150 million years. In contrast to other eukaryotes one gene (RecQsim) exists exclusively in plants. It possesses an interrupted helicase domain but nevertheless seems to have maintained the RecQ function. Owing to a recent gene duplication besides the AtRecQl4A gene an additional RecQ-like gene (AtRecQl4B) exists in the Brassicaceae only. Genetic studies indicate that a AtRecQl4A knockout results in sensitivity to mutagens as well as an hyper-recombination phenotype. Since AtRecQl4B was still present, both genes must have non-redundant roles. Analysis of plant RecQ-like genes will not only increase the knowledge on DNA repair and recombination, but also on the evolution and radiation of protein families.
20086189	Cytochrome P450 family member CYP704B2 catalyzes the {omega}-hydroxylation of fatty acids and is required for anther cutin biosynthesis and pollen exine formation in rice.	2010	Plant Cell	The anther cuticle and microspore exine act as protective barriers for the male gametophyte and pollen grain, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of the monomers of which they are composed. We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male sterile mutant, cyp704B2, which exhibits a swollen sporophytic tapetal layer, aborted pollen grains without detectable exine, and undeveloped anther cuticle. In addition, chemical composition analysis indicated that cutin monomers were hardly detectable in the cyp704B2 anthers. These defects are caused by a mutation in a cytochrome P450 family gene, CYP704B2. The CYP704B2 transcript is specifically detected in the tapetum and the microspore from stage 8 of anther development to stage 10. Heterologous expression of CYP704B2 in yeast demonstrated that CYP704B2 catalyzes the production of omega -hydroxylated fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbon chains. Our results provide insights into the biosynthesis of the two biopolymers sporopollenin and cutin. Specifically, our study indicates that the omega -hydroxylation pathway of fatty acids relying on this ancient CYP704B family, conserved from moss to angiosperms, is essential for the formation of both cuticle and exine during plant male reproductive and spore development.
12692345	The evolution of CONSTANS-like gene families in barley, rice, and Arabidopsis.	2003	Plant Physiol	The CO (CONSTANS) gene of Arabidopsis has an important role in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod. CO is part of a gene family with 17 members that are subdivided into three classes, termed Group I to III here. All members of the family have a CCT (CO, CO-like, TOC1) domain near the carboxy terminus. Group I genes, which include CO, have two zinc finger B-boxes near the amino terminus. Group II genes have one B-box, and Group III genes have one B-box and a second diverged zinc finger. Analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequence identified 16 genes (OsA-OsP) that were also divided into these three groups, showing that their evolution predates monocot/dicot divergence. Eight Group I genes (HvCO1-HvCO8) were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare), of which two (HvCO1 and HvCO2) were highly CO like. HvCO3 and its rice counterpart (OsB) had one B-box that was distantly related to Group II genes and was probably derived by internal deletion of a two B-box Group I gene. Sequence homology and comparative mapping showed that HvCO1 was the counterpart of OsA (Hd1), a major determinant of photoperiod sensitivity in rice. Major genes determining photoperiod response have been mapped in barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum), but none corresponded to CO-like genes. Thus, selection for variation in photoperiod response has affected different genes in rice and temperate cereals. The peptides of HvCO1, HvCO2 (barley), and Hd1 (rice) show significant structural differences from CO, particularly amino acid changes that are predicted to abolish B-box2 function, suggesting an evolutionary trend toward a one-B-box structure in the most CO-like cereal genes.
19400948	Genome wide expression analysis of CBS domain containing proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh and Oryza sativa L. reveals their developmental and stress regulation.	2009	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: In Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh and Oryza sativa L., a large number of genes encode proteins of unknown functions, whose characterization still remains one of the major challenges. With an aim to characterize these unknown proteins having defined features (PDFs) in plants, we have chosen to work on proteins having a cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domain. CBS domain as such has no defined function(s) but plays a regulatory role for many enzymes and thus helps in maintaining the intracellular redox balance. Its function as sensor of cellular energy has also been widely suggested.

RESULTS: Our analysis has identified 34 CBS domain containing proteins (CDCPs) in Arabidopsis and 59 in Oryza. In most of these proteins, CBS domain coexists with other functional domain(s), which may indicate towards their probable functions. In order to investigate the role(s) of these CDCPs, we have carried out their detailed analysis in whole genomes of Arabidopsis and Oryza, including their classification, nomenclature, sequence analysis, domain analysis, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships and their expression patterns using public databases (MPSS database and microarray data). We have found that the transcript levels of some members of this family are altered in response to various stresses such as salinity, drought, cold, high temperature, UV, wounding and genotoxic stress, in both root and shoot tissues. This data would be helpful in exploring the so far obscure functions of CBS domain and CBS domain-containing proteins in plant stress responses.

CONCLUSION: We have identified, classified and suggested the nomenclature of CDCPs in Arabidopsis and Oryza. A comprehensive analysis of expression patterns for CDCPs using the already existing transcriptome profiles and MPSS database reveals that a few CDCPs may have an important role in stress response/tolerance and development in plants, which needs to be validated further through functional genomics.
20128882	Receptor-like kinase OsSIK1 improves drought and salt stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa) plants.	2010	Plant J	Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. A putative RLK gene, OsSIK1, with extracellular leucine-rich repeats was cloned and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa). OsSIK1 exhibits kinase activity in the presence of Mn(2+), and the OsSIK1 kinase domain has the ability to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP). OsSIK1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsSIK1 is expressed mainly in the stem and spikelet in rice. The expression of OsSIK1 is mainly induced by salt, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments. Transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsSIK1 show higher tolerance to salt and drought stresses than control plants. On the contrary, the knock-out mutants sik1-1 and sik1-2, as well as RNA interference (RNAi) plants, are sensitive to drought and salt stresses. The activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase are enhanced significantly in OsSIK1-overexpressing plants. Also, the accumulation of H(2)O(2) in leaves of OsSIK1-overexpressing plants is much less than that of the mutants, RNAi plants and control plants, as measured by 3,3'-diamino benzidine (DAB) staining. We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice. These results indicate that OsSIK1 plays important roles in salt and drought stress tolerance in rice, through the activation of the antioxidative system.
11361341	Rice ESTs with disease-resistance gene- or defense-response gene-like sequences mapped to regions containing major resistance genes or QTLs.	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	The chromosomal locations of 109 rice expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the rice genome were determined using a doubled haploid mapping population. These ESTs show high similarity to disease resistance genes or to defense response genes. Nine of the ESTs were mapped to three regions that contain genetically defined resistance genes on chromosomes 6 and 11. Clustering of the ESTs in the rice genome was observed at several chromosomal regions. Some of the clusters were located in regions where quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with partial resistance to rice blast, bacterial blight and sheath blight are known to lie. Three ESTs that were mapped to the regions containing blast resistance genes Pi2 and Pia were chosen for Northern analysis after inoculation of plants with the blast fungus. Two of them, which code for a receptor-like kinase and a putative membrane channel protein, respectively, and were mapped to the Pi2 locus, were induced by rice blast infection as early as 4 h after inoculation. Transcription of another EST, which codes for a homolog of a putative human tumor suppressor and was mapped to the region containing Pia, was repressed after blast infection. These findings demonstrate that the candidate-gene approach is an efficient way of mapping resistance genes or resistance QTLs in rice.
18838789	Cultivar identification of Korean rice based on DNA markers for blast resistance.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Cultivar identification of seven Korean domestic rice using DNA markers related to blast resistance was conducted. By PCR analyses using six markers, which we developed in a previous study, and one newly-developed marker for pib, it became possible to differentiate the seven cultivars from each other. This result should contribute not only to cultivar identification but also, to molecular breeding of blast resistance for Korean rice.
18943771	Identification and characterization of a new blast resistance gene located on rice chromosome 1 through linkage and differential analyses.	2004	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT The Chinese native cv. Q14 expresses a high level of resistance to many isolates of Pyricularia grisea collected from Japan, Thailand, and China. Q14 was crossed to an indica-susceptible cultivar, Q61. To rapidly determine the chromosomal location of the major resistance gene present in the cultivar, a linkage analysis using microsatellite markers was performed in the F(2) population segregating 3R:1S (resistant/susceptible) through bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) in combination with recessiveclass analysis (RCA). A total of 189 microsatellite markers selected from each chromosome equally (with approximately 10 centimorgans) were tested with the BSA approach. Only two markers, RM151 and RM259, located on chromosome 1 showed positive and negative polymorphisms, respectively, for a resistance gene segregating in the population. To confirm the polymorphic markers, a total of 155 viable susceptible individuals were tested with the RCA approach. The markers RM151 and RM259 were found to link to the resistance gene with recombination frequencies of 11.9 +/- 2.8% and 9.7 +/- 8.0%, respectively. For further characterization of the resistance gene, 3 resistance genes mapped on chromosome 1, as well as 15 major resistance genes that might be employed in the breeding program, were selected for differential tests with 85 Chinese isolates. The resistance gene identified in this research conveys reactions distinct from those conditioned by the 18 resistance genes. This new resistance gene tentatively was designated Pi27(t).
16404154	Characterization of rice mutants with enhanced susceptibility to rice blast.	2005	Mol Cells	As a first step towards identifying genes involving in the signal transduction pathways mediating rice blast resistance, we isolated 3 mutants lines that showed enhanced susceptibility to rice blast KJ105 (91-033) from a T-DNA insertion library of the japonica rice cultivar, Hwayeong. Since none of the susceptible phenotypes co-segregated with the T-DNA insertion we adapted a map-based cloning strategy to isolate the gene(s) responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of the Hwayeong mutants. A genetic mapping population was produced by crossing the resistant wild type Hwayeong with the susceptible cultivar, Nagdong. Chi-square analysis of the F2 segregating population indicated that resistance in Hwayeong was controlled by a single major gene that we tentatively named Pi-hy. Randomly selected susceptible plants in the F2 population were used to build an initial map of Pi-hy. The SSLP marker RM2265 on chromosome 2 was closely linked to resistance. High resolution mapping using 105 F2 plants revealed that the resistance gene was tightly linked, or identical, to Pib, a resistance gene with a nucleotide binding sequence and leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR) previously isolated. Sequence analysis of the Pib locus amplified from three susceptible mutants revealed lesions within this gene, demonstrating that the Pi-hy gene is Pib. The Pib mutations in 1D-22-10-13, 1D-54-16-8, and 1C-143-16-1 were, respectively, a missense mutation in the conserved NB domain 3, a nonsense mutation in the 5th LRR, and a nonsense mutation in the C terminus following the LRRs that causes a small deletion of the C terminus. These findings provide evidence that NB domain 3 and the C terminus are required for full activity of the plant R gene. They also suggest that alterations of the resistance gene can cause major differences in pathogen specificity by affecting interactions with an avirulence factor.
12168952	Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf and neck blast resistance in recombinant inbred line population of rice (Oryza sativa).	2002	DNA Res	Blast is an economically important disease of rice. To map genes controlling blast resistance, recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were developed from Khao Dawk Mali 105, an aromatic, blast-susceptible cultivar and the blast resistance donor, CT 9993-5-10-M (CT). A linkage map encompassing 2112 cM was constructed from 141 RILs using 90 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and 31 simple sequence repeats (SSR). Virulent isolates of blast fungus were identified by screening differential host sets against 87 single-spore isolates collected from the north and northeast of Thailand. Fifteen virulent blast isolates were selected for leaf blast screening. Neck blast was evaluated both under natural conditions and controlled inoculations. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for broad resistance spectrum (BRS) to leaf blast were located on chromosomes 7 and 9. In particular, the QTL(ch9) was mapped near the Pi5(t) locus. The QTL(ch7) was located close to a previously mapped partial resistance QTL. Both loci showed significant allelic interaction. Genotypes having CT alleles at both QTL(ch7) and QTL(ch9) were the most resistant. Two neck-blast QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 5 and 6. The inconsistent map locations between the leaf and neck blast QTLs indicate the complexity of fixing both leaf and neck blast resistance. The coincidence of BRS and field resistance QTLs on chromosome 7 supports the idea that BRS may reflect the broad resistance spectrum to leaf blast in rice. These findings laid the foundation for the development of a marker-assisted scheme for improving Khoa Dawk Mali 105 and the majority of aromatic Thai rice varieties that are susceptible to blast.
20478538	Activation of a Rac GTPase by the NLR family disease resistance protein Pit plays a critical role in rice innate immunity.	2010	Cell Host Microbe	The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) family proteins recognize pathogen-derived molecules and trigger immune responses in both plants and animals. In plants, the direct or indirect recognition of specific pathogen effectors by NLRs culminates in a hypersensitive response (HR) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), key components of the plant defense response. However, the molecules activated by NLRs and how they induce immune responses are largely unknown. We found that the rice GTPase OsRac1 at the plasma membrane interacts directly with Pit, an NLR protein that confers resistance to the rice blast fungus. OsRac1 contributes to Pit-mediated ROS production as well as the HR and is required for Pit-mediated disease resistance in rice. Furthermore, the active form of Pit induces the activation of OsRac1 at the plasma membrane. Thus, OsRac1 is activated by Pit during pathogen attack and plays a critical role in Pit-mediated immunity in rice.
19271956	The Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPiz-t encodes a predicted secreted protein that triggers the immunity in rice mediated by the blast resistance gene Piz-t.	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPiz-t activates immunity in a gene-for-gene fashion to rice mediated by the blast resistance gene Piz-t. To dissect the molecular mechanism underlying their recognition, we initiated the cloning of AvrPiz-t using a map-based cloning strategy. The AvrPiz-t gene was delimited to an approximately 21-kb genomic fragment, in which six genes were predicted. Complementation tests of each of these six candidate genes led to the final identification of AvrPiz-t, which encodes a 108-amino-acid predicted secreted protein with unknown function and no homologues in M. oryzae or in other sequenced fungi. We found that AvrPiz-t is present in the virulent isolate GUY11 but contains a Pot3 insertion at a position 462 bp upstream from the start codon. Complementation tests of AvrPiz-t genes driven by promoters of varying length revealed that a promoter larger than 462 bp is essential to maintain the AvrPiz-t function. These results suggest that a Pot3 insertion in GUY11 might interfere with the proper function of AvrPiz-t. Additionally, we found that AvrPiz-t can suppress the programmed cell death triggered by mouse BAX protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, identifying a mechanism by which AvrPiz-t may contribute virulence of M. oryzae.
18533827	A genome-wide meta-analysis of rice blast resistance genes and quantitative trait loci provides new insights into partial and complete resistance.	2008	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The completion of the genome sequences of both rice and Magnaporthe oryzae has strengthened the position of rice blast disease as a model to study plant-pathogen interactions in monocotyledons. Genetic studies of blast resistance in rice were established in Japan as early as 1917. Despite such long-term study, examples of cultivars with durable resistance are rare, partly due to our limited knowledge of resistance mechanisms. A rising number of blast resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been genetically described, and some have been characterized during the last 20 years. Using the rice genome sequence, can we now go a step further toward a better understanding of the genetics of blast resistance by combining all these results? Is such knowledge appropriate and sufficient to improve breeding for durable resistance? A review of bibliographic references identified 85 blast resistance genes and approximately 350 QTL, which we mapped on the rice genome. These data provide a useful update on blast resistance genes as well as new insights to help formulate hypotheses about the molecular function of blast QTL, with special emphasis on QTL for partial resistance. All these data are available from the OrygenesDB database.
18944889	Identification of a new resistance gene to a chinese blast fungus isolate in the Japanese rice cultivar aichi asahi.	1998	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Genetic analysis of the rice cultivar Aichi Asahi and some other Japanese cultivars for the high resistance to the blast fungus isolate CHNOS58-3-1 from China was performed. All the Japanese differential cultivars were resistant to the isolate except for 'Pi No. 4', which showed moderate resistance. Analysis of the F(2) population of a cross of the susceptible cultivar Reiho and the resistant cultivar Aichi Asahi indicated that the resistance of 'Aichi Asahi' to the isolate was conferred by one dominant gene. To identify the gene in other Japanese differential cultivars, AK lines, which were derived from a cross of 'Aichi Asahi' x 'K59' and assumed to harbor no known genes except for the new one, were used for the allelism tests. The new, completely dominant resistance gene was detected in 14 differential cultivars, but not in 'Pi No. 4', 'Yashiro-mochi', and 'K1', and was designated as Pi19(t). Pi19(t) was allelic or closely linked to Pita(2) on chromosome 12. Pi19(t) was extensively distributed among Japanese traditional local cultivars.
19594308	Characterization of rice blast resistance genes in the Pik cluster and fine mapping of the Pik-p locus.	2009	Phytopathology	Pik-p is carried by cv. K60, which is one of the Japanese differentials widely used in both Japan and China since the 1980s. Its utility and specificity was evaluated with a total of 612 isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae collected from various regions in China in combination with 16 main resistance genes being used in the breeding programs. Pik-p is an independently and dominantly acting gene in the Pik cluster, which conditions differential reactions against many isolates and contains higher resistance in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Sichuan provinces, China, indicating that this gene could be still used in these regions. A high-resolution genetic map of Pik-p was constructed using genomic position-ready markers. A set of 47 recombinants out of 681 F(2) plants derived from the crosses cv. K60 (resistant) x cv. AS20-1 (susceptible) and x cv. Kasalath (susceptible) was identified in the genetic interval defined by the markers RM5926 and K37 which flank the Pik gene cluster. This set was then genotyped with seven markers known to reside within the interval. The closest markers to Pik-p were K28 (approximately 0.60 centimorgans [cM]) and K39 (approximately 0.07 cM). A further four markers in the K28-K39 interval were developed from an in silico analysis based on the cv. Nipponbare genome sequence, and these all co-segregated with Pik-p. This 0.67-cM region is equivalent to a physical separation in cv. Nipponbare of approximately 126 kb, plus an as-yet-unfilled genomic gap of unknown length. Four nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat-type resistance genes are present in this interval, and these represent good candidates for Pik-p.
15716503	Identification and characterization of regions of the rice genome associated with broad-spectrum, quantitative disease resistance.	2005	Genetics	Much research has been devoted to understanding the biology of plant-pathogen interactions. The extensive genetic analysis of disease resistance in rice, coupled with the sequenced genome and genomic resources, provides the opportunity to seek convergent evidence implicating specific chromosomal segments and genes in the control of resistance. Published data on quantitative and qualitative disease resistance in rice were synthesized to evaluate the distributions of and associations among resistance loci. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to multiple diseases and qualitative resistance loci (R genes) were clustered in the rice genome. R genes and their analogs of the nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat class and genes identified on the basis of differential representation in disease-related EST libraries were significantly associated with QTL. Chromosomal segments associated with broad-spectrum quantitative disease resistance (BS-QDR) were identified. These segments contained numerous positional candidate genes identified on the basis of a range of criteria, and groups of genes belonging to two defense-associated biochemical pathways were found to underlie one BS-QDR region. Genetic dissection of disease QTL confidence intervals is needed to reduce the number of positional candidate genes for further functional analysis. This study provides a framework for future investigations of disease resistance in rice and related crop species.
18944075	Natural Variation at the Pi-ta Rice Blast Resistance Locus.	2003	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT The resistance gene Pi-ta protects rice crops against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea expressing the avirulence gene AVR-Pita in a gene-for-gene manner. Pi-ta, originally introgressed into japonica rice from indica origin, was previously isolated by positional cloning. In this study, we report the nucleotide sequence of a 5,113-base pair region containing a japonica susceptibility pi-ta allele, which has overall 99.6% nucleotide identity to the indica Pi-ta allele conferring resistance. The intron region shows the levels of sequence diversity that typically differentiate genes from indica and japonica rices, but the other gene regions show less diversity. Sequences of the Pi-ta allele from resistant cultivars Katy and Drew from the southern United States are identical to the resistance Pi-ta sequence. Sequences from susceptible cultivars El Paso 144 and Cica 9 from Latin America define a third susceptibility haplotype. This brings the total number of Pi-ta haplotypes identified to four, including the resistance allele and three susceptibility alleles. The Pi-ta locus shows low levels of DNA polymorphism compared with other analyzed R genes. Understanding the natural diversity at the Pi-ta locus is important for designing specific markers for incorporation of this R gene into rice-breeding programs.
22355686	Non-host resistance to penetration and hyphal growth of Magnaporthe oryzae in Arabidopsis.	2011	Sci Rep	Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating disease of rice. Mechanisms of rice resistance to blast have been studied extensively, and the rice-M. oryzae pathosystem has become a model for plant-microbe interaction studies. However, the mechanisms of non-host resistance (NHR) to rice blast in other plants remain poorly understood. We found that penetration resistance to M. oryzae in multiple mutants, including pen2 NahG pmr5 agb1 and pen2 NahG pmr5 mlo2 plants, was severely compromised and that fungal growth was permitted in penetrated epidermal cells. Furthermore, rice Pi21 enhanced movement of infection hyphae from penetrated Arabidopsis epidermal cells to adjacent mesophyll cells. These results indicate that PEN2, PMR5, AGB1, and MLO2 function in both penetration and post-penetration resistance to M. oryzae in Arabidopsis, and suggest that the absence of rice Pi21 contributed to Arabidopsis NHR to M. oryzae.
15319478	A putative polyketide synthase/peptide synthetase from Magnaporthe grisea signals pathogen attack to resistant rice.	2004	Plant Cell	Isolates of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea that carry the gene encoding Avirulence Conferring Enzyme1 (ACE1) are specifically recognized by rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars carrying the resistance gene Pi33. This recognition enables resistant plants to activate a defense response. ACE1 was isolated by map-based cloning and encodes a putative hybrid between a polyketide synthase and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, enzymes involved in microbial secondary metabolism. ACE1 is expressed exclusively during fungal penetration of host leaves, the time point at which plant defense reactions are triggered. Ace1 appears to be localized in the cytoplasm of the appressorium. Mutation of the putative catalytic site of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain of Ace1 abolishes recognition of the fungus by resistant rice. This suggests that Ace1 biosynthetic activity is required for avirulence. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the fungal signal recognized by resistant rice plants is the secondary metabolite whose synthesis depends on Ace1.
18433432	Magnaporthe grisea avirulence gene ACE1 belongs to an infection-specific gene cluster involved in secondary metabolism.	2008	New Phytol	The avirulence gene ACE1 from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea encodes a polyketide synthase (PKS) fused to a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) probably involved in the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite recognized by Pi33 resistant rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars. Analysis of the M. grisea genome revealed that ACE1 is located in a cluster of 15 genes, of which 14 are potentially involved in secondary metabolism as they encode enzymes such as a second PKS-NRPS (SYN2), two enoyl reductases (RAP1 and RAP2) and a putative Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) transcription factor (BC2). These 15 genes are specifically expressed during penetration into the host plant, defining an infection-specific gene cluster. A pORF3-GFP transcriptional fusion showed that the highly expressed ORF3 gene from the ACE1 cluster is only expressed in appressoria, as is ACE1. Phenotypic analysis of deletion or disruption mutants of SYN2 and RAP2 showed that they are not required for avirulence in Pi33 rice cultivars, unlike ACE1. Inactivation of other genes was unsuccessful because targeted gene replacement and disruption were inefficient at this locus. Overall, the ACE1 gene cluster displays an infection-specific expression pattern restricted to the penetration stage which is probably controlled at the transcriptional level and reflects regulatory networks specific to early stages of infection.
17115220	Molecular mapping of two cultivar-specific avirulence genes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.	2007	Mol Genet Genomics	Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is a globally important disease of rice that causes annual yield losses. The segregation of genes controlling the virulence of M. grisea on rice was studied to establish the genetic basis of cultivar specificity in the interaction of rice and M. grisea. The segregation of avirulence and virulence was studied in 87 M. grisea F(1) progeny isolates from a cross of two isolates, Guy11 and JS153, using resistance-gene-differential rice cultivars. The segregation ratio indicated that avirulence and virulence in the rice cultivars Aichi-asahi and K59, respectively, are controlled by single major genes. Genetic analyses of backcrosses and full-sib crosses in these populations were also performed. The chi(2 )test of goodness-of-fitness for a 1:1 ratio indicated that one dominant gene controls avirulence in Aichi-asahi and K59 in this population. Based on the resistance reactions of rice differential lines harboring known resistance genes to the parental isolates, two genetically independent avirulence genes, AVR-Pit and AVR-Pia, were identified. Genetic linkage analysis showed that the SSR marker m355-356 is closely linked to AVR-Pit, on the telomere of chromosome 1 at a distance of approximately 2.3 cM. The RAPD marker S487, which was converted to a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, was found to be closely linked to AVR-Pia, on the chromosome 7 telomere at a distance of 3.5 cM. These molecular markers will facilitate the positional cloning of the two AVR genes, and can be applied to molecular-marker-assisted studies of M. grisea populations.
12582534	Mapping QTLs for field resistance to the rice blast pathogen and evaluating their individual and combined utility in improved varieties.	2002	Theor Appl Genet	Lines from a Lemont x Teqing recombinant inbred population were evaluated for dilatory resistance to rice blast disease using: (1) the Standard Evaluation System (SES) for rating leaf blast, (2) the percentage diseased leaf area (%DLA), and (3) the area under a disease progress curve (AUDPC). RFLP mapping using 175 well-distributed loci revealed nine QTLs, one each on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9, with two loci on chromosome 12. All nine putative QTLs were associated with AUDPC, six with both a %DLA and a SES rating. Teqing contributed the resistance allele for all these loci except for the one located on chromosome 4. Individual QTLs accounted for 5-32% of the observed phenotypic variation, and combined QTL models accounted for 43-53%. Three QTLs were located near three of the four major resistance genes previously identified in this population. The resistances of both Lemont and Teqing were attributable to a combination of both major genes capable of inducing hypersensitive reactions and minor genes causing less-distinctive phenotypic differences. Interactions were noted between QTLs and major genes. Our findings are in support of the strategy of pyramiding major genes and QTLs in carefully selected combinations to develop improved varieties with resistance to the blast fungus that is both broad in spectrum and durable.
17333252	Nitrite-driven anaerobic ATP synthesis in barley and rice root mitochondria.	2007	Planta	Mitochondria isolated from the roots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were capable of oxidizing external NADH and NADPH anaerobically in the presence of nitrite. The reaction was linked to ATP synthesis and nitric oxide (NO) was a measurable product. The rates of NADH and NADPH oxidation were in the range of 12-16 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein for both species. The anaerobic ATP synthesis rate was 7-9 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein for barley and 15-17 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein for rice. The rates are of the same order of magnitude as glycolytic ATP production during anoxia and about 3-5% of the aerobic mitochondrial ATP synthesis rate. NADH/NADPH oxidation and ATP synthesis were sensitive to the mitochondrial inhibitors myxothiazol, oligomycin, diphenyleneiodonium and insensitive to rotenone and antimycin A. The uncoupler FCCP completely eliminated ATP production. Succinate was also capable of driving ATP synthesis. We conclude that plant mitochondria, under anaerobic conditions, have a capacity to use nitrite as an electron acceptor to oxidize cytosolic NADH/NADPH and generate ATP.
15141293	Use of Pi5(t) markers in marker-assisted selection to screen for cultivars with resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Identification of the PCR markers tightly linked to genes that encode important agronomic traits is useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The rice Pi5(t) locus confers broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease. It has been hypothesized that the Pi5(t) locus carries the same gene as that encoded by the Pi3(t) and Pii(t) loci. We developed three PCR-based dominant markers (JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3) from three previously identified BIBAC clones-JJ80, JJ81, and JJ113-that are linked to the Pi5(t) locus. PCR analysis of 24 monogenic lines revealed that these markers are present only in lines that carry Pi5(t), Pi3(t), and Pii(t). PCR and DNA gel-blot analysis of candidate resistance lines using JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3 indicated that Tetep is the likely donor of Pi5(t). Of the 184 rice varieties tested, 34 carried the JJ80-T3-, JJ81-T3-, and JJ113-T3-specific bands. Disease evaluation of those 34 varieties revealed that all conferred resistance to PO6-6. The genomic structure of three of these resistant varieties (i.e., IR72, Taebaeg, Jahyangdo) is most similar to that of Pi5(t). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the JJ80-T3, JJ81-T3, and JJ113-T3 markers for MAS for M. grisea resistance.
15497407	Candidate defense genes as predictors of quantitative blast resistance in rice.	2004	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Although quantitative trait loci (QTL) underpin many desirable agronomic traits, their incorporation into crop plants through marker-assisted selection is limited by the low predictive value of markers on phenotypic performance. Here we used candidate defense response (DR) genes to dissect quantitative resistance in rice using recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced backcross (BC) populations derived from a blast-resistant cultivar, Sanhuangzhan 2 (SHZ-2). Based on DNA profiles of DR genes, RI lines were clustered into two groups corresponding to level of resistance. Five DR genes, encoding putative oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein, accounted for 30.0, 23.0, 15.8, 6.7, and 5.5% of diseased leaf area (DLA) variation, respectively. Together, they accounted for 60.3% of the DLA variation and co-localized with resistance QTL identified by interval mapping. Average phenotypic contributions of oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein in BC lines were 26.1, 19.0, 18.0, 11.5, and 10.6%, respectively, across environments. Advanced BC lines with four to five effective DR genes showed enhanced resistance under high disease pressure in field tests. Our results demonstrate that the use of natural variation in a few candidate genes can solve a long-standing problem in rice production and has the potential to address other problems involving complex traits.
18510771	Development and evaluation of a high-throughput, low-cost genotyping platform based on oligonucleotide microarrays in rice.	2008	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: We report the development of a microarray platform for rapid and cost-effective genetic mapping, and its evaluation using rice as a model. In contrast to methods employing whole-genome tiling microarrays for genotyping, our method is based on low-cost spotted microarray production, focusing only on known polymorphic features.

RESULTS: We have produced a genotyping microarray for rice, comprising 880 single feature polymorphism (SFP) elements derived from insertions/deletions identified by aligning genomic sequences of the japonica cultivar Nipponbare and the indica cultivar 93-11. The SFPs were experimentally verified by hybridization with labeled genomic DNA prepared from the two cultivars. Using the genotyping microarrays, we found high levels of polymorphism across diverse rice accessions, and were able to classify all five subpopulations of rice with high bootstrap support. The microarrays were used for mapping of a gene conferring resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the causative organism of rice blast disease, by quantitative genotyping of samples from a recombinant inbred line population pooled by phenotype.

CONCLUSION: We anticipate this microarray-based genotyping platform, based on its low cost-per-sample, to be particularly useful in applications requiring whole-genome molecular marker coverage across large numbers of individuals.
18943979	Development of Co-Dominant Amplified Polymorphic Sequence Markers in Rice that Flank the Magnaporthe grisea Resistance Gene Pi7(t) in Recombinant Inbred Line 29.	2004	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Pi7(t), a dominant blast resistance gene derived from the rice cultivar Moroberekan, confers complete resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Pi7(t) previously was positioned on chromosome 11 by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping of a recombinant inbred line population. One derivative of this population, recombinant inbred line (RIL)29, was designated as the representative line for Pi7(t). A segregating F2 population was created from RIL29 in order to determine the location of Pi7(t). The new mapping data indicate a position for Pi7(t) 30 centimorgans distal to the original location. Pi7(t) shares a common position with the previously mapped Pi1 M. grisea resistance gene. RIL29 carries DNA not derived from either parent used to create the RIL population at the newly assigned Pi7(t) locus. RFLP analysis has identified a possible donor source.
16353550	Evolution of an avirulence gene, AVR1-CO39, concomitant with the evolution and differentiation of Magnaporthe oryzae.	2005	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	The significance of AVR1-CO39, an avirulence gene of the blast fungus corresponding to Pi-CO39(t) in rice cultivars, during the evolution and differentiation of the blast fungus was evaluated by studying its function and distribution in Pyricularia spp. When the presence or absence of AVR1-CO39 was plotted on a dendrogram constructed from ribosomal DNA sequences, a perfect parallelism was observed between its distribution and the phylogeny of Pyricularia isolates. AVR1-CO39 homologs were exclusively present in one species, Pyricularia oryzae, suggesting that AVR1-CO39 appeared during the early stage of evolution of P. oryzae. Transformation assays showed that all the cloned homologs tested are functional as an avirulence gene, indicating that selection has maintained their function. Nevertheless, Oryza isolates (isolates virulent on Oryza spp.) in P. oryzae were exceptionally noncarriers of AVR1-CO39. All Oryza isolates suffered from one of the two types of known rearrangements at the Avr1-CO39 locus (i.e., G type and J type). These types were congruous to the two major lineages of Oryza isolates from Japan determined by MGR586 and MAGGY. These results indicate that AVR1-CO39 was lost during the early stage of evolution of the Oryza-specific subgroup of P. oryzae. Interestingly, its corresponding resistance gene, Pi-CO39(t), is not widely distributed in Oryza spp.
23025618	Genome size is not correlated with effective population size in the Oryza species.	2012	Evolution	Genome sizes vary widely across the tree of life and the evolutionary mechanism underlined remains largely unknown. Lynch and Conery (2003) proposed that evolution of genome complexity was driven mainly by nonadaptive stochastic forces and presented the observation that genome size was negatively correlated with effective population size (N(e)) as a strong support for their hypothesis. Here, we analyzed the relation between N(e) and genome size for 10 diploid Oryza species that showed about fourfold genome size variation. Using sequences of more than 20 nuclear genes, we estimated N(e) for each species after correction for the effects of demography and heterogeneity of mutation rates among loci and species. Pairwise comparisons and correlation analyses did not detect a negative relationship between N(e) and genome size despite about 6.5-fold interspecies N(e) variation. By calculating phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) for N(e), we repeated correlation analysis and did not find any correlation between N(e) and genome size. These observations suggest that the genome size variation in the Oryza species cannot be explained simply by the effect of effective population size.
22115274	New grass phylogeny resolves deep evolutionary relationships and discovers C4 origins.	2012	New Phytol	• Grasses rank among the world's most ecologically and economically important plants. Repeated evolution of the C(4) syndrome has made photosynthesis highly efficient in many grasses, inspiring intensive efforts to engineer the pathway into C(3) crops. However, comparative biology has been of limited use to this endeavor because of uncertainty in the number and phylogenetic placement of C(4) origins. • We built the most comprehensive and robust molecular phylogeny for grasses to date, expanding sampling efforts of a previous working group from 62 to 531 taxa, emphasizing the C(4)-rich PACMAD (Panicoideae, Arundinoideae, Chloridoideae, Micrairoideae, Aristidoideae and Danthonioideae) clade. Our final matrix comprises c. 5700 bp and is > 93% complete. • For the first time, we present strong support for relationships among all the major grass lineages. Several new C(4) lineages are identified, and previously inferred origins confirmed. C(3)/C(4) evolutionary transitions have been highly asymmetrical, with 22-24 inferred origins of the C(4) pathway and only one potential reversal. • Our backbone tree clarifies major outstanding systematic questions and highlights C(3) and C(4) sister taxa for comparative studies. Two lineages have emerged as hotbeds of C(4) evolution. Future work in these lineages will be instrumental in understanding the evolution of this complex trait.
18973681	Towards the understanding of the cocoa transcriptome: Production and analysis of an exhaustive dataset of ESTs of Theobroma cacao L. generated from various tissues and under various conditions.	2008	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Theobroma cacao L., is a tree originated from the tropical rainforest of South America. It is one of the major cash crops for many tropical countries. T. cacao is mainly produced on smallholdings, providing resources for 14 million farmers. Disease resistance and T. cacao quality improvement are two important challenges for all actors of cocoa and chocolate production. T. cacao is seriously affected by pests and fungal diseases, responsible for more than 40% yield losses and quality improvement, nutritional and organoleptic, is also important for consumers. An international collaboration was formed to develop an EST genomic resource database for cacao.

RESULTS: Fifty-six cDNA libraries were constructed from different organs, different genotypes and different environmental conditions. A total of 149,650 valid EST sequences were generated corresponding to 48,594 unigenes, 12,692 contigs and 35,902 singletons. A total of 29,849 unigenes shared significant homology with public sequences from other species.Gene Ontology (GO) annotation was applied to distribute the ESTs among the main GO categories.A specific information system (ESTtik) was constructed to process, store and manage this EST collection allowing the user to query a database.To check the representativeness of our EST collection, we looked for the genes known to be involved in two different metabolic pathways extensively studied in other plant species and important for T. cacao qualities: the flavonoid and the terpene pathways. Most of the enzymes described in other crops for these two metabolic pathways were found in our EST collection.A large collection of new genetic markers was provided by this ESTs collection.

CONCLUSION: This EST collection displays a good representation of the T. cacao transcriptome, suitable for analysis of biochemical pathways based on oligonucleotide microarrays derived from these ESTs. It will provide numerous genetic markers that will allow the construction of a high density gene map of T. cacao. This EST collection represents a unique and important molecular resource for T. cacao study and improvement, facilitating the discovery of candidate genes for important T. cacao trait variation.
22943852	Spatio-temporal regulation of the OsHFP gene promoter establishes the involvement of this protein in rice anther development.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Anther development leading to pollen maturation, anther dehiscence and pollen dispersal depends upon the precise timing of programmed cell death (PCD) in specified anther tissues. The PCD necessitates a properly tuned transcriptional regulation of some crucial genes. However, the detailed genetic regulation of this PCD in rice anther is yet to be deciphered. Recently, we have established that the OsHFP, a structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice is a flower-specific heme binding protein, and plays a role in chlorophyll degradation. Here, we report the spatio-temporal transcriptional regulation of the OsHFP gene, which is proposed to be involved in anther PCD. The OsHFP was immunodetected in rice anthers, and OsHFP-related proteins were also found to be present in anthers of other monocot (lily) and dicot (tobacco) plant species. Unique cis-acting elements, possibly involved in the activation and anther-specificity of the OsHFP promoter were identified based upon in silico prediction and in planta expression profiling of the reporter gene driven by the OsHFP promoter (2051 bp) and its two deleted versions (1057 bp and 437 bp). The temporal regulation of the OsHFP promoter in different developmental stages of tobacco anther implies the physiological function of this protein in anther PCD.
22808069	A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing.	2012	PLoS One	The HKT family of Na(+) and Na(+)/K(+) transporters is implicated in plant salinity tolerance. Amongst these transporters, the cereal HKT1;4 and HKT1;5 are responsible for Na(+) exclusion from photosynthetic tissues, a key mechanism for plant salinity tolerance. It has been suggested that Na(+) is retrieved from the xylem transpiration stream either in the root or the leaf sheath, protecting the leaf blades from excessive Na(+) accumulation. However, direct evidence for this scenario is scarce. Comparative modeling and evaluation of rice (Oryza sativa) HKT-transporters based on the recent crystal structure of the bacterial TrkH K(+) transporter allowed to reconcile transcriptomic and physiological data. For OsHKT1;5, both transcript abundance and protein structural features within the selectivity filter could control shoot Na(+) accumulation in a range of rice varieties. For OsHKT1;4, alternative splicing of transcript and the anatomical complexity of the sheath needed to be taken into account. Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath. Overall, allelic variation of leaf blade Na(+) accumulation can be explained by a complex interplay of gene transcription, alternative splicing and protein structure.
22500940	A Gaijin-like miniature inverted repeat transposable element is mobilized in rice during cell differentiation.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE) is one type of transposable element (TE), which is largely found in eukaryotic genomes and involved in a wide variety of biological events. However, only few MITEs were proved to be currently active and their physiological function remains largely unknown.

RESULTS: We found that the amplicon discrepancy of a gene locus LOC_Os01g0420 in different rice cultivar genomes was resulted from the existence of a member of Gaijin-like MITEs (mGing). This result indicated that mGing transposition was occurred at this gene locus. By using a modified transposon display (TD) analysis, the active transpositions of mGing were detected in rice Jiahua No. 1 genome under three conditions: in seedlings germinated from the seeds received a high dose γ-ray irradiation, in plantlets regenerated from anther-derived calli and from scutellum-derived calli, and were confirmed by PCR validation and sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or short additional DNA sequences at transposition sites post mGing transposition. It suggested that sequence modification was possibly taken place during mGing transposition. Furthermore, cell re-differentiation experiment showed that active transpositions of both mGing and mPing (another well studied MITE) were identified only in regenerated plantlets.

CONCLUSIONS: It is for the first time that mGing active transposition was demonstrated under γ-ray irradiation or in cell re-differentiation process in rice. This newly identified active MITE will provide a foundation for further analysis of the roles of MITEs in biological process.
22228816	Evaluation of four phloem-specific promoters in vegetative tissues of transgenic citrus plants.	2012	Tree Physiol	'Mexican' lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) was transformed with constructs that contained chimeric promoter-gus gene fusions of phloem-specific rolC promoter of Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose-H(+) symporter (AtSUC2) gene promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana, rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) promoter and sucrose synthase l (RSs1) gene promoter of Oryza sativa (rice). Histochemical β-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed vascular-specific expression of the GUS protein in citrus. The RTBV promoter was the most efficient promoter in this study while the RSs1 promoter could drive low levels of gus gene expression in citrus. These results were further validated by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Southern blot analysis confirmed stable transgene integration, which ranged from a single insertion to four copies per genome. The use of phloem-specific promoters in citrus will allow targeted transgene expression of antibacterial constructs designed to battle huanglongbing disease (HLB or citrus greening disease), associated with a phloem-limited Gram-negative bacterium.
22359654	A highly conserved, small LTR retrotransposon that preferentially targets genes in grass genomes.	2012	PLoS One	LTR retrotransposons are often the most abundant components of plant genomes and can impact gene and genome evolution. Most reported LTR retrotransposons are large elements (>4 kb) and are most often found in heterochromatic (gene poor) regions. We report the smallest LTR retrotransposon found to date, only 292 bp. The element is found in rice, maize, sorghum and other grass genomes, which indicates that it was present in the ancestor of grass species, at least 50-80 MYA. Estimated insertion times, comparisons between sequenced rice lines, and mRNA data indicate that this element may still be active in some genomes. Unlike other LTR retrotransposons, the small LTR retrotransposons (SMARTs) are distributed throughout the genomes and are often located within or near genes with insertion patterns similar to MITEs (miniature inverted repeat transposable elements). Our data suggests that insertions of SMARTs into or near genes can, in a few instances, alter both gene structures and gene expression. Further evidence for a role in regulating gene expression, SMART-specific small RNAs (sRNAs) were identified that may be involved in gene regulation. Thus, SMARTs may have played an important role in genome evolution and genic innovation and may provide a valuable tool for gene tagging systems in grass.
20457876	A genetic model for the female sterility barrier between Asian and African cultivated rice species.	2010	Genetics	S(1) is the most important locus acting as a reproductive barrier between Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima. It is a complex locus, with factors that may affect male and female fertility separately. Recently, the component causing the allelic elimination of pollen was fine mapped. However, the position and nature of the component causing female sterility remains unknown. To fine map the factor of the S(1) locus affecting female fertility, we developed a mapping approach based on the evaluation of the degree of female transmission ratio distortion (fTRD) of markers. Through implementing this methodology in four O. sativa x O. glaberrima crosses, the female component of the S(1) locus was mapped into a 27.8-kb (O. sativa) and 50.3-kb (O. glaberrima) region included within the interval bearing the male component of the locus. Moreover, evidence of additional factors interacting with S(1) was also found. In light of the available data, a model where incompatibilities in epistatic interactions between S(1) and the additional factors are the cause of the female sterility barrier between O. sativa and O. glaberrima was developed to explain the female sterility and the TRD mediated by S(1). According to our model, the recombination ratio and allelic combinations between these factors would determine the final allelic frequencies observed for a given cross.
22363621	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Grain size is a major yield component in rice, and partly controlled by the sizes of the lemma and palea. Molecular mechanisms controlling the sizes of these organs largely remain unknown. In this study, we show that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins is involved in determining rice grain length by controlling cell length in the lemma/palea. Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice. PGL1 is an atypical non-DNA-binding bHLH and assumed to function as an inhibitor of a typical DNA-binding bHLH through heterodimerization. We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG). PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus. As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes. Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma revealed that are caused by increased cell length. PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1.
21562713	Polymorphic minisatellites in the mitochondrial DNAs of Oryza and Brassica.	2011	Curr Genet	Polymorphic analyses of angiosperm mitochondrial DNA are rare in comparison with chloroplast DNA, because few target sequences in angiosperm mitochondrial DNA are known. Minisatellites, a tandem array of repeated sequences with a repeat unit of 10 to ~100 bp, are popular target sequences of animal mitochondria, but Beta vulgaris is the only known angiosperm species for which such an analysis has been conducted. From this lack of information, it was uncertain as to whether polymorphic minisatellites existed in other angiosperm species. Ten plant mitochondrial DNAs were found to contain minisatellite-like repeated sequences, most of which were located in intergenic regions but a few occurred in gene coding and intronic regions. Oryza and Brassica accessions were selected as models for the investigation of minisatellite polymorphism because substantial systematic information existed. PCR analysis of 42 Oryza accessions revealed length polymorphisms in four of the five minisatellites. The mitochondrial haplotypes of the 16 Oryza accessions with chromosomal complement (genome) types of CC, BBCC and CCDD were identical but were clearly distinguished from BB-genome accessions, a result consistent with the notion that the cytoplasmic donor parent of the amphidiploid species might be the CC-genome species. Twenty-nine accessions of six major cultivated species of Brassica were classified into five mitochondrial haplotypes based on two polymorphic minisatellites out of six loci. The haplotypes of Brassica juncea and Brassica carinata accessions were identical to Brassica rapa and Brassica nigra accessions, respectively. The haplotypes of Brassica napus accessions were heterogeneous and unique, results that were consistent with previous studies.
22643901	The isolation of Pi1, an allele at the Pik locus which confers broad spectrum resistance to rice blast.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	We report the isolation of Pi1, a gene conferring broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that Pi1 is an allele at the Pik locus. Like other alleles at this locus, Pi1 consists of two genes. A functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) was identified that allows differentiation of Pi1 from other Pik alleles and other non-Pik genes. A extensive germplasm survey using this FNP reveals that Pi1 is a rare allele in germplasm collections and one that has conferred durable resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogen isolates.
22268451	Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza.	2012	Plant J	Asian rice, Oryza sativa, consists of two major subspecies, indica and japonica, which are physiologically differentiated and adapted to different latitudes. Genes for photoperiod sensitivity are likely targets of selection along latitude. We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice. Geographical subdivision between tropical and subtropical O. rufipogon was found for all of the photoperiod genes in plants divided by the Tropic of Cancer (TOC). All of these genes, except for PhyB, were characterized by the existence of clades that split a long time ago and that corresponded to latitudinal subdivisions, and revealed a likely diversifying selection. Ssp. indica showed close affinity to tropical O. rufipogon for all genes, while ssp. japonica, which has a much wider range of distribution, displayed complex patterns of differentiation from O. rufipogon, which reflected various agricultural needs in relation to crop yield. In japonica, all genes, except Hd3a, were genetically differentiated at the TOC, while geographical subdivision occurred at 31°N in Hd3a, probably the result of varying photoperiods. Many other features of the photoperiod genes revealed domestication signatures, which included high linkage disequilibrium (LD) within genes, the occurrence of frequent and recurrent non-functional Hd1 mutants in cultivated rice, crossovers between subtropical and tropical alleles of Hd1, and significant LD between Hd1 and Hd3a in japonica and indica.
18408163	Cassandra retrotransposons carry independently transcribed 5S RNA.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We report a group of TRIMs (terminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature), which are small nonautonomous retrotransposons. These elements, named Cassandra, universally carry conserved 5S RNA sequences and associated RNA polymerase (pol) III promoters and terminators in their long terminal repeats (LTRs). They were found in all vascular plants investigated. Uniquely for LTR retrotransposons, Cassandra produces noncapped, polyadenylated transcripts from the 5S pol III promoter. Capped, read-through transcripts containing Cassandra sequences can also be detected in RNA and in EST databases. The predicted Cassandra RNA 5S secondary structures resemble those for cellular 5S rRNA, with high information content specifically in the pol III promoter region. Genic integration sites are common for Cassandra, an unusual feature for abundant retrotransposons. The 5S in each LTR produces a tandem 5S arrangement with an inter-5S spacing resembling that of cellular 5S. The distribution of 5S genes is very variable in flowering plants and may be partially explained by Cassandra activity. Cassandra thus appears both to have adapted a ubiquitous cellular gene for ribosomal RNA for use as a promoter and to parasitize an as-yet-unidentified group of retrotransposons for the proteins needed in its lifecycle.
17546083	Genetic variation in the chloroplast genome suggests multiple domestication of cultivated Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Genome	Two hundred and seventy-five accessions of cultivated Asian rice and 44 accessions of AA genome Oryza species were classified into 8 chloroplast (cp) genome types (A-H) based on insertion-deletion events at 3 regions (8K, 57K, and 76K) of the cp genome. The ancestral cp genome type was determined according to the frequency of occurrence in Oryza species and the likely evolution of the variable 57K region of the cp genome. When 2 nucleotide substitutions (AA or TT) were taken into account, these 8 cp types were subdivided into 11 cp types. Most indica cultivars had 1 of 3 cp genome types that were also identified in the wild relatives of rice, O. nivara and O. rufipogon, suggesting that the 3 indica cp types had evolved from distinct gene pools of the O. rufipogon - O. nivara complex. The majority of japonica cultivars had 1 of 3 different cp genome types. One of these 3 was identified in O. rufipogon, suggesting that at least 1 japonica type is derived from O. rufipogon with the same cp genome type. These results provide evidence to support a polyphyletic origin of cultivated Asian rice from at least 4 principal lineages in the O. rufipogon - O. nivara complex.
7672603	Characterization of a dispersed repetitive DNA sequence associated with the CCDD genome of wild rice.	1995	Genome	A HindII repetitive fragment (pOD3) was isolated and cloned from the genomic DNA of an accession of Oryza latifolia, a wild rice species that possesses a tetraploid CCDD genome. Southern blot analysis using this clone as a probe demonstrated that this repetitive DNA sequence had a dispersed organization in the CCDD genome and seemed to be highly specific for this genome type. This fragment is the first CCDD-specific repeated DNA sequence to be described. The hybridization pattern is similar for most CCDD accessions tested, although a few showed no hybridization signal. The nucleotide sequence of the element cloned in pOD3 was determined and analysed. The 1783 base pair long repeated sequence shows no homology with other known nucleotide sequences. In addition, none of the amino acid sequences deduced from the potential open reading frames contained in the pOD3 repeat is homologous to any known protein. The nucleotide sequence presents several internal repeats, direct or inverted, but their significance remains unknown.
8851805	Complex arrangement of dispersed repeated DNA sequences in Oryza officinalis.	1996	Genome	A 525-bp BglII fragment was isolated from Oryza officinalis DNA (accession W1278) and shown to correspond to a new dispersed repetitive DNA sequence with specificity restricted to a subset of the wild rice with a C genome. The sequence of the fragment was determined but it does not correspond to any sequence already present in databases. It contains several imperfect palindromes. Larger genomic clones (12-18 kbp) were isolated and all contain sequences homologous to the BglII element. Analysis of these clones confirms that the BglII element is dispersed in the O. officinalis genome. From one genomic clone, the sequences adjacent to the BglII element were subcloned and used as probes to demonstrate that the sequences flanking the BglII element are variable in different genomic clones and that some of them are also dispersed repetitive sequences. The genomic specificity of two of these dispersed repeats was evaluated and shown to be different from that of the initial BglII element. This analysis revealed a complex arrangement of various dispersed repeated sequences.
22859673	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells.	2012	J Exp Bot	The RecA/RAD51 family of rice (Oryza sativa) consists of at least 13 members. However, the functions of most of these members are unknown. Here the functional characterization of one member of this family, RAD51C, is reported. Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice. Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility. Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs). PMCs had an absence of normal pachytene chromosomes and had abnormal chromosome fragments. The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development. However, the RAD51C-KO line was sensitive to different DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells.
22666315	Evolution and association analysis of Ghd7 in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Plant height, heading date, and yield are the main targets for rice genetic improvement. Ghd7 is a pleiotropic gene that controls the aforementioned traits simultaneously. In this study, a rice germplasm collection of 104 accessions (Oryza sativa) and 3 wild rice varieties (O.rufipogon) was used to analyze the evolution and association of Ghd7 with plant height, heading date, and yield. Among the 104 accessions, 76 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and six insertions and deletions were found within a 3932-bp DNA fragment of Ghd7. A higher pairwise π and θ in the promoter indicated a highly diversified promoter of Ghd7. Sixteen haplotypes and 8 types of Ghd7 protein were detected. SNP changes between haplotypes indicated that Ghd7 evolved from two distinct ancestral gene pools, and independent domestication processes were detected in indica and japonica varietals respectively. In addition to the previously reported premature stop mutation in the first exon of Ghd7, which caused phenotypic changes of multiple traits, we found another functional C/T mutation (SNP S_555) by structure-based association analysis. SNP S_555 is located in the promoter and was related to plant height probably by altering gene expression. Moreover, another seven SNP mutations in complete linkage were found to be associated with the number of spikelets per panicle, regardless of the photoperiod. These associations provide the potential for flexibility of Ghd7 application in rice breeding programs.
19672692	Analysis of genome expression in the response of Oryza granulata to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae.	2010	Mol Biol Rep	In order to understand the mechanism of the strong resistance of Oryza granulata to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), cDNA microarrays containing 2,436 cDNA clones of Oryza granulata derived from Suppression subtractive library and cDNA library were constructed and genome expression patterns after inoculating Xoo were investigated. Three hundred and 83 clones were up-regulated, 836 clones were down-regulated after pathogen infection. Approximately 800 clones were sequenced and BLAST search were carried out. There are no homologous sequences for 35 clones of them. The functions of the homologous sequences for most clones are unknown. The known functions of the homologous sequences involved in photosynthesis, respiration, material transport, signal transduction, pathogenesis-related proteins, transcription factors, the active oxygen scavenging system and so on. The putative functions of them in responding to Xoo were discussed.
18687674	Collection and comparative analysis of 1888 full-length cDNAs from wild rice Oryza rufipogon Griff. W1943.	2008	DNA Res	A huge amount of cDNA and EST resources have been developed for cultivated rice species Oryza sativa; however, only few cDNA resources are available for wild rice species. In this study, we isolated and completely sequenced 1888 putative full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) clones from wild rice Oryza rufipogon Griff. W1943 for comparative analysis between wild and cultivated rice species. Two cDNA libraries were constructed from 3-week-old leaf samples under either normal or cold-treated conditions. Homology searching of these cDNA sequences revealed that >96.8% of the wild rice cDNAs were matched to the cultivated rice O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genome sequence. However, <22% of them were fully matched to the cv. Nipponbare genome sequence. The comparative analysis showed that O. rufipogon W1943 had greater similarity to O. sativa ssp. japonica than to ssp. indica cultivars. In addition, 17 novel rice cDNAs were identified, and 41 putative tissue-specific expression genes were defined through searching the rice massively parallel signature-sequencing database. In conclusion, these FLcDNA clones are a resource for further function verification and could be broadly utilized in rice biological studies.
8251186	Classification and relationships of rice strains with AA genome by identification of transposable elements at nine loci.	1993	Jpn J Genet	We analyzed the presence of p-SINE1 members at five loci in the rice strains belonging to seven species with AA genome in the Oryza genus by the methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Four p-SINE1 members (p-SINE1-r3, r4, r5 and r7) were present at the corresponding loci in all the strains examined. One member (p-SINE1-r6) was, however, not present at the corresponding locus in most of the African strains of O. glaberrima and O. barthii, but was in the other strains. The PCR-amplified fragments containing p-SINE1-r4 in many strains were found to be larger due to insertion of either one of two transposable elements, named Tnr2 and Ret1, within or near p-SINE1-r4, respectively: Tnr2 is 157 bp in length with terminal inverted repeat sequences of about 56 bp; Ret1 is only 13 bp in length with a T stretch at its end. Tnr2 was not present in the corresponding locus in all the strains belonging to O. sativa Japonica and in some strains of O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata, while Ret1 was present only in the two strains of O. longistaminata. These results and previous ones obtained from the analysis of the other two p-SINE1 members (p-SINE1-r1 and r2) in the Wx gene indicate that the elements, such as p-SINE1-r6, Tnr2, Ret1 and p-SINE1-r2, have been inserted into the respective loci during divergence of the rice species with AA genome. The patterns for the presence and absence of the transposable elements at the respective loci enabled us to classify the rice strains with AA genome into ten groups and to infer their relationships.
3185503	Rice mitochondrial genome contains a rearranged chloroplast gene cluster.	1988	Mol Gen Genet	We have previously reported the isolation and partial sequence analysis of a rice mitochondrial DNA fragment (6.9 kb) which contains a transferred copy of a chloroplast gene cluster coding for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), beta and epsilon subunits of ATPase (atpB and atpE), methionine tRNA (trnM) and valine tRNA (trnV). We have now completely sequenced this 6.9 kb fragment and found it to also contain a sequence homologous to the chloroplast gene coding for the ribosomal protein L2 (rpl2), beginning at a site 430 bp downstream from the termination codon of rbcL. In the chloroplast genome, two copies of rpl2 are located at distances of 20 kb and 40 kb, respectively, from rbcL. We have sequenced these two copies of rice chloroplast rpl2 and found their sequences to be identical. In addition, a 151 bp sequence located upstream of the chloroplast rpl2 coding region is also found in the 3' noncoding region of chloroplast rbcL and other as yet undefined locations in the rice chloroplast genome. Hybridization analysis revealed that this 151 bp repeat sequence identified in rice is also present in several copies in 11 other plant species we have examined. Findings from these studies suggest that the translocation of rpl2 to the rbcL gene cluster found in the rice mitochondrial genome might have occurred through homologous recombination between the 151 bp repeat sequence present in both rpl2 and rbcL.
7916734	Characterization of new variants of a satellite DNA from Oryza officinalis, specific for the CC genome of wild rice.	1993	Genome	Two groups of tandemly repeated DNA fragments have been isolated and cloned from the Oryza officinalis genome (W 1278). These fragments have been sequenced and are 374 and 367 bp long. They were compared with an element previously isolated from another O. officinalis accession. They are 76 and 92% homologous to the latter and show 78% homology between themselves. The two types of elements are interspersed within large blocks of tandemly organized units. Their copy number is in the range of 200,000 units. This sequence was present only in wild rice accessions with a CC genome. However, this apparent specificity is even more restricted, since it was absent from some O. officinalis accessions and from the allotetraploid species of the CCDD type. Use of digestions with 4-bp restriction enzyme cutters and analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels revealed polymorphism that might be used to map the repeats in the genome as well as to establish the relationship between accessions. Finally, hybridization of the repeated sequence to DNA prepared from the eight available O. sativa-O. officinalis monosomic addition lines revealed that the elements are located on two alien chromosomes. This suggests that these elements have at least some restricted chromosome specificity.
22891238	CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS1, encoding a monocot-specific MADS box protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	The control of floral organ identity by homeotic MADS box genes is well established in eudicots. However, grasses have highly specialized outer floral organs, and the identities of the genes that regulate the highly specialized outer floral organs of grasses remain unclear. In this study, we characterized a MIKC-type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa). The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs. Map-based cloning demonstrated that CFO1 encoded the OsMADS32 protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CFO1/OsMADS32 belonged to a monocot-specific clade in the MIKC-type MADS box gene family. The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs. The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers. Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers. We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression.
22589467	Nramp5 is a major transporter responsible for manganese and cadmium uptake in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	Paddy rice (Oryza sativa) is able to accumulate high concentrations of Mn without showing toxicity; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Mn uptake are unknown. Here, we report that a member of the Nramp (for the Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein) family, Nramp5, is involved in Mn uptake and subsequently the accumulation of high concentrations of Mn in rice. Nramp5 was constitutively expressed in the roots and encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein. Nramp5 was polarly localized at the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells. Knockout of Nramp5 resulted in a significant reduction in growth and grain yield, especially when grown at low Mn concentrations. This growth reduction could be partially rescued by supplying high concentrations of Mn but not by the addition of Fe. Mineral analysis showed that the concentration of Mn and Cd in both the roots and shoots was lower in the knockout line than in wild-type rice. A short-term uptake experiment revealed that the knockout line lost the ability to take up Mn and Cd. Taken together, Nramp5 is a major transporter of Mn and Cd and is responsible for the transport of Mn and Cd from the external solution to root cells.
22792078	The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers.	2012	PLoS Genet	HEI10 was first described in human as a RING domain-containing protein that regulates cell cycle and cell invasion. Mice HEI10(mei4) mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata. In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination. In the rice hei10 mutant, chiasma frequency is markedly reduced, and those remaining chiasmata exhibit a random distribution among cells, suggesting possible involvement of HEI10 in the formation of interference-sensitive crossovers (COs). However, mutation of HEI10 does not affect early recombination events and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes. It initially appears as distinct foci and co-localizes with MER3. Thereafter, HEI10 signals elongate along the chromosomes and finally restrict to prominent foci that specially localize to chiasma sites. The linear HEI10 signals always localize on ZEP1 signals, indicating that HEI10 extends along the chromosome in the wake of synapsis. Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components.
22900499	Heterogeneous evolutionary rates of Pi2/9 homologs in rice.	2012	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: The Pi2/9 locus contains multiple nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes in the rice genome. Although three functional R-genes have been cloned from this locus, little is known about the origin and evolutionary history of these genes. Herein, an extensive genome-wide survey of Pi2/9 homologs in rice, sorghum, Brachypodium and Arabidopsis, was conducted to explore this theme.

RESULTS: In our study, 1, 1, 5 and 156 Pi2/9 homologs were detected in Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomes, respectively. Two distinct evolutionary patterns of Pi2/9 homologs, Type I and Type II, were observed in rice lines. Type I Pi2/9 homologs showed evidence of rapid gene diversification, including substantial copy number variations, obscured orthologous relationships, high levels of nucleotide diversity or/and divergence, frequent sequence exchanges and strong positive selection, whereas Type II Pi2/9 homologs exhibited a fairly slow evolutionary rate. Interestingly, the three cloned R-genes from the Pi2/9 locus all belonged to the Type I genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the Pi2/9 locus had an ancient origin predating the common ancestor of gramineous species. The existence of two types of Pi2/9 homologs suggest that diversifying evolution should be an important strategy of rice to cope with different types of pathogens. The relationship of cloned Pi2/9 genes and Type I genes also suggests that rapid gene diversification might facilitate rice to adapt quickly to the changing spectrum of the fungal pathogen M. grisea. Based on these criteria, other potential candidate genes that might confer novel resistance specificities to rice blast could be predicted.
17660692	Phylogenetic analysis of Oryza rufipogon strains and their relations to Oryza sativa strains by insertion polymorphism of rice SINEs.	2007	Genes Genet Syst	Oryza rufipogon, the progenitor of the cultivated rice species Oryza sativa, is known by its wide intraspecific variation. In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyses of O. rufipogon strains and their relationships to O. sativa strains by using 26 newly identified p-SINE1 members from O. rufipogon strains, in addition to 23 members previously identified from O. sativa strains. A total of 103 strains of O. rufipogon and O. sativa were examined for the presence and absence of each of the p-SINE1 members at respective loci by PCR with a pair of primers that hybridize to the regions flanking each p-SINE1 member. A phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the insertion polymorphism of p-SINE1 members showed that O. rufipogon and O. sativa strains are classified into three groups. The first group consisted of O. rufipogon perennial strains mostly from China and O. sativa ssp. japonica strains, which included javanica strains forming a distinct subgroup. The second group consisted of almost all the O. rufipogon annual strains, a few O. rufipogon perennial strains and O. sativa ssp. indica strains. These groupings, in addition to other results, support the previous notion that annual O. rufipogon originated in the O. rufipogon perennial population, and that O. sativa originated polyphyletically in the O. rufipogon populations. The third group consisted of the other perennial strains and intermediate-type strains of O. rufipogon, in which the intermediate-type strains are most closely related to a hypothetical ancestor with no p-SINE1 members at the respective loci and to those belonging to the other rice species with the AA genome. This suggests that O. rufipogon perennial strains are likely to have originated from the O. rufipogon intermediate-ecotype population.
12561229	[Cloning and sequencing of fragments associated with cytoplasm male sterility of rice].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Mitochorndrial DNA (mtDNA), nuclear DNA (nDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA) were individually extracted from Zhenshan 97A, Xieqingzao A and A-23, which were cytoplasmic male sterile (wild abortive, dwarf abortive and BT), and from Zhenshan 97B, Xieqingzao B and BT, which were maintainers lines. Each of them was analyzed with 500 random primers by RAPD. Six fragments specific to male sterile lines were amplified. A fragment, PWH-17, associated with wild and dwarf abortive type cytoplasmic male sterility was analyzed by Southern blotting and sequencing, and also tested by SCAR. It was 1879 bp in length, which contained 6 open reading frames and 8 repeated sequences. BLAST search revealed that partial sequence in PWH-17 showed high similarity to the upstream sequence of tRNA-Asp gene in Elytrigia elongate (GenBank accession number U14335) and wheat (X13243). The similarity ratios were 97% and 100%. It was inferred that the possible position of PWH-17 in rice (wild abortive) could be located between tRNA-Asp and Cox II, which will be discussed further.
22937009	A putative gene sbe3-rs for resistant starch mutated from SBE3 for starch branching enzyme in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	Foods high in resistant starch (RS) are beneficial to prevent various diseases including diabetes, colon cancers, diarrhea and chronic renal or hepatic diseases. Elevated RS in rice is important for public health since rice is a staple food for half of the world population. A japonica mutant 'Jiangtangdao 1' (RS = 11.67%) was crossed with an indica cultivar 'Miyang 23' (RS = 0.41%). The mutant sbe3-rs that explained 60.4% of RS variation was mapped between RM6611 and RM13366 on chromosome 2 (LOD = 36) using 178 F(2) plants genotyped with 106 genome-wide polymorphic SSR markers. Using 656 plants from four F(3:4) families, sbe3-rs was fine mapped to a 573.3 Kb region between InDel 2 and InDel 6 using one STS, five SSRs and seven InDel markers. SBE3 which codes for starch branching enzyme was identified as a candidate gene within the putative region. Nine pairs of primers covering 22 exons were designed to sequence genomic DNA of the wild type for SBE3 and the mutant for sbe3-rs comparatively. Sequence analysis identified a missense mutation site where Leu-599 of the wild was changed to Pro-599 of the mutant in the SBE3 coding region. Because the point mutation resulted in the loss of a restriction enzyme site, sbe3-rs was not digested by a CAPS marker for SpeI site while SBE3 was. Co-segregation of the digestion pattern with RS content among 178 F(2) plants further supported sbe3-rs responsible for RS in rice. As a result, the CAPS marker could be used in marker-assisted breeding to develop rice cultivars with elevated RS which is otherwise difficult to accurately assess in crops. Transgenic technology should be employed for a definitive conclusion of the sbe3-rs.
22136599	Aberrant spikelet and panicle1, encoding a TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressor, is involved in the regulation of meristem fate in rice.	2012	Plant J	Post-embryonic development depends on the activity of meristems in plants, and thus control of cell fate in the meristem is crucial to plant development and its architecture. In grasses such as rice and maize, the fate of reproductive meristems changes from indeterminate meristems, such as inflorescence and branch meristems, to determinate meristems, such as the spikelet meristem. Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice, aberrant spikelet and panicle1 (asp1), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and disarrangement of phyllotaxy. Close examination revealed that regulation of meristem fate was compromised in asp1: degeneration of the inflorescence meristem was delayed, transition from the branch meristem to the spikelet meristem was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch meristem and the spikelet meristem was compromised. The genetic program was also disturbed in terms of spikelet development. Gene isolation revealed that ASP1 encodes a transcriptional co-repressor that is related to TOPLESS (TPL) in Arabidopsis and RAMOSA ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2) in maize. It is likely that the pleiotropic defects are associated with de-repression of multiple genes related to meristem function in the asp1 mutant. The asp1 mutant also showed de-repression of axillary bud growth and disturbed phyllotaxy in the vegetative phase, suggesting that the function of this gene is closely associated with auxin action. Consistent with these observations and the molecular function of Arabidopsis TPL, auxin signaling was also compromised in the rice asp1 mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that ASP1 regulates various aspects of developmental processes and physiological responses as a transcriptional co-repressor in rice.
22870184	The organelle genomes of Hassawi rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its hybrid in saudi arabia: genome variation, rearrangement, and origins.	2012	PLoS One	Hassawi rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a landrace adapted to the climate of Saudi Arabia, characterized by its strong resistance to soil salinity and drought. Using high quality sequencing reads extracted from raw data of a whole genome sequencing project, we assembled both chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes of the wild-type Hassawi rice (Hassawi-1) and its dwarf hybrid (Hassawi-2). We discovered 16 InDels (insertions and deletions) but no SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) is present between the two Hassawi cp genomes. We identified 48 InDels and 26 SNPs in the two Hassawi mt genomes and a new type of sequence variation, termed reverse complementary variation (RCV) in the rice cp genomes. There are two and four RCVs identified in Hassawi-1 when compared to 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica), respectively. Microsatellite sequence analysis showed there are more SSRs in the genic regions of both cp and mt genomes in the Hassawi rice than in the other rice varieties. There are also large repeats in the Hassawi mt genomes, with the longest length of 96,168 bp and 96,165 bp in Hassawi-1 and Hassawi-2, respectively. We believe that frequent DNA rearrangement in the Hassawi mt and cp genomes indicate ongoing dynamic processes to reach genetic stability under strong environmental pressures. Based on sequence variation analysis and the breeding history, we suggest that both Hassawi-1 and Hassawi-2 originated from the Indonesian variety Peta since genetic diversity between the two Hassawi cultivars is very low albeit an unknown historic origin of the wild-type Hassawi rice.
22408071	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1.	2012	Plant Cell	Seed shattering is an important agricultural trait in crop domestication. SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication. However, the regulatory pathways of seed shattering in rice remain unknown. Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line. The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice. Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4. We also identified a frameshift mutant of SH4 that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering. Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification. qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation.
8651913	A methyltransferase for synthesis of the flavanone phytoalexin sakuranetin in rice leaves.	1996	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves irradiated with short wave UV light accumulated the major rice phytoalexin, flavanone sakuranetin. The extracts from these leaves catalyzed the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 7 of naringenin to yield sakuranetin, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor. Activity of the naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase was not found in healthy rice leaves but increased upon irradiation with UV light in parallel with increase in sakuranetin. The autoradiogram of the enzymatic product on 2D-TLC was found to be sakuranetin. The enzyme did not methylate sakuranetin, but methylated other flavanones, but not isoflavanones.
10814825	Naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the flavanone phytoalexin sakuranetin from rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2000	Plant Sci	An inducible S-adenosyl-L-methionine:naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT) catalyzing the methylation of naringenin to sakuranetin, a major rice phytoalexin was purified approximately 985-fold from ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated rice leaves. The enzyme is not found in healthy tissues and was purified to a nearly homogeneous preparation in one step using adenosine-agarose affinity chromatography, with 1 g rice leaves (UV-irradiated) as starting material. Gel filtration chromatography resulted in an almost pure enzyme, as evidenced by a major band migrating to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 41 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified NOMT was strongly inhibited by Mn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Hg(2+), and Cd(2+), and to a low degree by Co(2+), Mg(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The amino acid sequence of a NOMT cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-cleavage peptide was highly homologous to that of a caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase from maize, and about 70% of the amino acid sequence was obtained after sequencing the peptides generated by CNBr and/or formic acid hydrolysis. NOMT was also shown to be induced in a time-dependent manner, and purified from rice leaves treated with jasmonic acid and copper chloride.
19811687	Comparative genome analysis of lignin biosynthesis gene families across the plant kingdom.	2009	BMC Bioinformatics	BACKGROUND: As a major component of plant cell wall, lignin plays important roles in mechanical support, water transport, and stress responses. As the main cause for the recalcitrance of plant cell wall, lignin modification has been a major task for bioenergy feedstock improvement. The study of the evolution and function of lignin biosynthesis genes thus has two-fold implications. First, the lignin biosynthesis pathway provides an excellent model to study the coordinative evolution of a biochemical pathway in plants. Second, understanding the function and evolution of lignin biosynthesis genes will guide us to develop better strategies for bioenergy feedstock improvement.

RESULTS: We analyzed lignin biosynthesis genes from fourteen plant species and one symbiotic fungal species. Comprehensive comparative genome analysis was carried out to study the distribution, relatedness, and family expansion of the lignin biosynthesis genes across the plant kingdom. In addition, we also analyzed the comparative synteny map between rice and sorghum to study the evolution of lignin biosynthesis genes within the Poaceae family and the chromosome evolution between the two species. Comprehensive lignin biosynthesis gene expression analysis was performed in rice, poplar and Arabidopsis. The representative data from rice indicates that different fates of gene duplications exist for lignin biosynthesis genes. In addition, we also carried out the biomass composition analysis of nine Arabidopsis mutants with both MBMS analysis and traditional wet chemistry methods. The results were analyzed together with the genomics analysis.

CONCLUSION: The research revealed that, among the species analyzed, the complete lignin biosynthesis pathway first appeared in moss; the pathway is absent in green algae. The expansion of lignin biosynthesis gene families correlates with substrate diversity. In addition, we found that the expansion of the gene families mostly occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots, with the exception of the C4H gene family. Gene expression analysis revealed different fates of gene duplications, largely confirming plants are tolerant to gene dosage effects. The rapid expansion of lignin biosynthesis genes indicated that the translation of transgenic lignin modification strategies from model species to bioenergy feedstock might only be successful between the closely relevant species within the same family.
20879839	AVR1-CO39 is a predominant locus governing the broad avirulence of Magnaporthe oryzae 2539 on cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Magnaporthe oryzae 2539 was previously found to be avirulent to most rice cultivars and, therefore, was assumed to carry many avirulence (AVR) genes. However, only one AVR gene, AVR1-CO39, which corresponds to a resistance (R) gene Pi-CO39(t) in rice cv. CO39, has been found from 2539 thus far. In order to identify more AVR genes, we isolated 228 progeny strains from a cross between 2539 and Guy11, an M. oryzae strain with strong virulence on rice, and inoculated these strains onto 23 rice accessions (22 individual cultivars and a mixture of 14 cultivars) that are all resistant to 2539 but susceptible to Guy11. Unexpectedly, the experimental results indicated that the avirulence of 2539 on these rice cultivars appeared to be controlled only by the AVR1-CO39 locus. Consistent with this result, we further found that all except one of the rice cultivars were resistant to two transformed Guy11 strains carrying a 1.05-kb fragment containing the AVR1-CO39 gene from 2539. These results suggest that AVR1-CO39 is a predominant locus controlling the broad avirulence of 2539 on cultivated rice. Based on the results of this study and other previous studies, we infer that AVR1-CO39 is a species-wise rather than a cultivar-wise host-specific AVR locus of M. oryzae for rice.
18943271	New gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice located on chromosome 12 identified from minghui 63, an elite restorer line.	2002	Phytopathology	ABSTRACT Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is a serious disease of rice worldwide. A new dominant gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice, Xa25(t), was identified from Minghui 63, a restorer line for a number of rice hybrids that are widely cultivated in China. This gene conferred resistance to Philippine race 9 (PXO339) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae in both seedling and adult stages. It was mapped to the centromeric region of chromosome 12, 2.5 cM from a disease resistance gene-homologous sequence, NBS109, and 7.3 cM from a restriction fragment length polymorphism marker, G1314. The genomic location of this gene is similar to the previously identified blast resistance genes, Pi-ta and Pi-ta2.
21781278	Induced Pib Expression and Resistance to Magnaporthe grisea are Compromised by Cytosine Demethylation at Critical Promoter Regions in Rice.	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	Pib is a well-characterized rice blast-resistance gene belonging to the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily. Expression of Pib was low under non-challenged conditions, but strongly induced by the blast-causing fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, thereby conferring resistance to the pathogen. It is generally established that cytosine methylation of the promoter-region often plays a repressive role in modulating expression of the gene in question. We report here that two critical regions of the Pib promoter were heavily CG cytosine-methylated in both cultivars studied. Surprisingly, induced expression of Pib by M. grisea infection did not entail its promoter demethylation, and partial demethylation by 5-azacytidine-treatment actually reduced Pib expression relative to wild-type plants. Accordingly, the blast disease-resistance was compromised in the 5'-azaC-treated plants relative to wild-type. In contrast, the disease susceptibility was not affected by the 5'-azaC treatment in another two rice cultivars that did not contain the Pib gene, ruling out effects of other R genes and non-specific genotoxic effects by the drug-treatment as a cause for the compromised Pib-conditioned blast-resistance. Taken together, our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation plays a novel enhancing role in conditioning high-level of induced expression of the Pib gene in times of M. grisea infection, and its conferred resistance to the pathogen.
22058403	The single functional blast resistance gene Pi54 activates a complex defence mechanism in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	The Pi54 gene (Pi-k(h)) confers a high degree of resistance to diverse strains of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In order to understand the genome-wide co-expression of genes in the transgenic rice plant Taipei 309 (TP) containing the Pi54 gene, microarray analysis was performed at 72 h post-inoculation of the M. oryzae strain PLP-1. A total of 1154 differentially expressing genes were identified in TP-Pi54 plants. Of these, 587 were up-regulated, whereas 567 genes were found to be down-regulated. 107 genes were found that were exclusively up-regulated and 58 genes that were down- regulated in the case of TP-Pi54. Various defence response genes, such as callose, laccase, PAL, and peroxidase, and genes related to transcription factors like NAC6, Dof zinc finger, MAD box, bZIP, and WRKY were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic line. The enzymatic activities of six plant defence response enzymes, such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, β-glucosidase, β-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase, were found to be significantly high in TP-Pi54 at different stages of inoculation by M. oryzae. The total phenol content also increased significantly in resistant transgenic plants after pathogen inoculation. This study suggests the activation of defence response and transcription factor-related genes and a higher expression of key enzymes involved in the defence response pathway in the rice line TP-Pi54, thus leading to incompatible host-pathogen interaction.
22270148	The identification of Pi50(t), a new member of the rice blast resistance Pi2/Pi9 multigene family.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	The deployment of broad-spectrum resistance genes is the most effective and economic means of controlling blast in rice. The cultivar Er-Ba-Zhan (EBZ) is a widely used donor of blast resistance in South China, with many cultivars derived from it displaying broad-spectrum resistance against blast. Mapping in a set of recombinant inbred lines bred from the cross between EBZ and the highly blast-susceptible cultivar Liangjiangxintuanheigu (LTH) identified in EBZ a blast resistance gene on each of chromosomes 1 (Pish), 6 (Pi2/Pi9) and 12 (Pita/Pita-2). The resistance spectrum and race specificity of the allele at Pi2/Pi9 were both different from those present in other known Pi2/Pi9 carriers. Fine-scale mapping based on a large number of susceptible EBZ × LTH F(2) and EBZ × LTH BC(1)F(2) segregants placed the gene within a 53-kb segment, which includes Pi2/Pi9. Sequence comparisons of the LRR motifs of the four functional NBS-LRR genes within Pi2/Pi9 revealed that the EBZ allele is distinct from other known Pi2/Pi9 alleles. As a result, the gene has been given the designation Pi50(t).
22415685	Identification of the novel recessive gene pi55(t) conferring resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Sci China Life Sci	The elite rice cultivar Yuejingsimiao 2 (YJ2) is characterized by a high level of grain quality and yield, and resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae. YJ2 showed 100% resistance to four fungal populations collected from Guangdong, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang Provinces, which is a higher frequency than that shown by the well-known resistance (R) gene donor cultivars such as Sanhuangzhan 2 and 28zhan. Segregation analysis for resistance with F(2) and F(4) populations indicated the resistance of YJ2 was controlled by multiple genes that are dominant or recessive. The putative R genes of YJ2 were roughly tagged by SSR markers, located on chromosomes 2, 6, 8, and 12, in a bulked-segregant analysis using genome-wide selected SSR markers with F(4) lines that segregated into 3 resistant (R):1 susceptible (S) or 1R:3S. The recessive R gene on chromosome 8 was further mapped to an interval ≈1.9 cM/152 kb in length by linkage analysis with genomic position-ready markers in the mapping population derived from an F(4) line that segregated into 1R:3S. Given that no major R gene was mapped to this interval, the novel R gene was designated as pi55(t). Out of 26 candidate genes predicted in the region based on the reference genomic sequence of the cultivar Nipponbare, two genes that encode a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein and heavy-metal-associated domain-containing protein, respectively, were suggested as the most likely candidates for pi55(t).
22916136	Comparative analysis of zinc finger proteins involved in plant disease resistance.	2012	PLoS One	A meta-analysis was performed to understand the role of zinc finger domains in proteins of resistance (R) genes cloned from different crops. We analyzed protein sequences of seventy R genes of various crops in which twenty six proteins were found to have zinc finger domains along with nucleotide binding sites - leucine rice repeats (NBS-LRR) domains. We identified thirty four zinc finger domains in the R proteins of nine crops and were grouped into 19 types of zinc fingers. The size of individual zinc finger domain within the R genes varied from 11 to 84 amino acids, whereas the size of proteins containing these domains varied from 263 to 1305 amino acids. The biophysical analysis revealed that molecular weight of Pi54 zinc finger was lowest whereas the highest one was found in rice Pib zinc finger named as Transposes Transcription Factor (TTF). The instability (R(2) =0.95) and the aliphatic (R(2) =0.94) indices profile of zinc finger domains follows the polynomial distribution pattern. The pairwise identity analysis showed that the Lin11, Isl-1 & Mec-3 (LIM) zinc finger domain of rice blast resistance protein pi21 have 12.3% similarity with the nuclear transcription factor, X-box binding-like 1 (NFX) type zinc finger domain of Pi54 protein. For the first time, we reported that Pi54 (Pi-k(h)-Tetep), a rice blast resistance (R) protein have a small zinc finger domain of NFX type located on the C-terminal in between NBS and LRR domains of the R-protein. Compositional analysis depicted by the helical wheel diagram revealed the presence of a hydrophobic region within this domain which might help in exposing the LRR region for a possible R-Avr interaction. This domain is unique among all other cloned plant disease resistance genes and might play an important role in broad-spectrum nature of rice blast resistance gene Pi54.
21809091	Wax crystal-sparse leaf2, a rice homologue of WAX2/GL1, is involved in synthesis of leaf cuticular wax.	2012	Planta	Epicuticular wax in plants limits non-stomatal water loss, inhibits postgenital organ fusion, protects plants against damage from UV radiation and imposes a physical barrier against pathogen infection. Here, we give a detailed description of the genetic, physiological and morphological consequences of a mutation in the rice gene WSL2, based on a comparison between the wild-type and an EMS mutant. The mutant's leaf cuticle membrane is thicker and less organized than that of the wild type, and its total wax content is diminished by ~80%. The mutant is also more sensitive to drought stress. WSL2 was isolated by positional cloning, and was shown to encode a homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana genes CER3/WAX2/YRE/FLP1 and the maize gene GL1. It is expressed throughout the plant, except in the root. A transient assay carried out in both A. thaliana and rice protoplasts showed that the gene product is deposited in the endoplasmic reticulum. An analysis of the overall composition of the wax revealed that the mutant produces a substantially reduced quantity of C22-C32 fatty acids, which suggests that the function of WSL2 is associated with the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids.
21717056	Over-expression in the nucleotide-binding site-leucine rich repeat gene DEPG1 increases susceptibility to bacterial leaf streak disease in transgenic rice plants.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Bacterial leaf streak of rice (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is a widely-spread disease in the main rice-producing areas of the world. Investigating the genes that play roles in rice-Xoc interactions helps us to understand the defense signaling pathway in rice. Here we report a differentially expressed protein gene (DEPG1), which regulates susceptibility to BLS. DEPG1 is a nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-leucine rich repeat (LRR) gene, and the deduced protein sequence of DEPG1 has approximately 64% identity with that of the disease resistance gene Pi37. Phylogenetic analysis of DEPG1 and the 18 characterized NBS-LRR genes revealed that DEPG1 is more closely related to Pi37. DEPG1 protein is located to the cytoplasm, which was confirmed by transient expression of DEPG1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion construct in onion epidermal cells. Semi-quantitative PCR assays showed that DEPG1 is widely expressed in rice, and is preferentially expressed in internodes, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flag leaves. Observation of cross sections of leaves from the transgenic plants with a DEPG1-promoter::glucuronidase (GUS) fusion gene revealed that DEPG1 is also highly expressed in mesophyll tissues where Xoc mainly colonizes. Additionally, Xoc negatively regulates expression of DEPG1 at the early stage of the pathogen infection, and so do the three defense-signal compounds including salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC). Transgenic rice plants overexpressing DEPG1 exhibit enhanced susceptibility to Xoc compared to the wild-type controls. Moreover, enhanced susceptibility to Xoc may be mediated by inhibition of the expression of some SA biosynthesis-related genes and pathogenesis-related genes that may contribute to the disease resistance. Taken together, DEPG1 plays roles in the interactions between rice and BLS pathogen Xoc.
10887695	[Genetic studies of blast resistance of indica variety Zhefu 802].	2000	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	One indica variety, Zhefu 802, was studied for its inheritance of blast resistance by inoculation of two strains Ken54-04 and 95-t2. The B1F1 and F2 populations from cross of Zhefu 802(R) x Lijiangxintuanheigu (S) and related parents were inoculated by spray inoculation method with the two above mentioned strains to determine R:S ratio of segregating populations of this cross. The results indicated that Zhefu 802 has two dominant resistance genes to strain Ken 54-04. One of the two genes showed resistant reaction and the other is susceptible to strain 95-t2. The allelism test indicated that one gene in Zhefu 802, which showed resistant reaction to strain 95-t2, is allelic to Pi-i gene locus and non-allelic to loci of Pi-a, Pi-sh, Pi-k, Pi-z, Pi-ta, Pi-b, Pi-t. The other gene in this variety was also estimated to be different from all of the known genes. So it may be an unknown gene. But this point needs to be confirmed further.
11055122	[Gene analysis of blast resistance in an indica variety Digu].	2000	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Digu is one of the important genetic resources in rice breeding for resistance to blast disease in China. In this study, the disease resistance identification in the parental varieties and the population F1, F2 and B1F1 from the crosses involving Digu and four susceptible varieties was carried out by inoculation with two Chinese blast strains, ZB13, and ZB15. The results demonstrated that Digu had one dominant gene Pi-d(t) to ZB13, which had been reported by Li SG. The F2 populations of Digu and other ten different varieties with known resistance genes were inoculated with strains ZB13 and the results further demonstrated that blast resistance of Digu to strain ZB13 was controlled by one dominant resistance gene.
11059273	[Utilization of a microsatellite marker to identify rice blast resistance gene in two segregating populations].	2000	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	The microsatellite (SSLP) marker RM262, which is tightly linked to the blast resistance gene Pi-d(t) in rice, provides means to conduct marker-aided selection in a rice breeding program. The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of this marker to select the blast resistance gene, Pi-d(t), in two crosses for rice blast resistance breeding. The products with amplified the microsatellite primers were polymorphic between the three varieties examined. To examine the power of the identified microsatellite marker in predicting the Pi-d(t) locus, we determined the genotypes of the two F2 populations at the Pi-d(t) locus by performing progeny testing for the disease respones. The results indicated an accuracy of more than 98% in identifying the resistant plants in both populations. Therefore the microsatellite marker can be utilized in marker-assisted selection and breeding for new varieties with blast resistance.
12561228	[Genetic analysis of blast resistance in japonica rice landrace heikezijing from Taihu region].	2002	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Japonica rice landrace Heikezijing (HKZJ) from Taihu region is highly resistant to several Chinese and Japanese differential strains of Magnaporthe grisea. The F1, F2 and RIL populations from the cross between the resistant variety Heikezijing and the susceptible variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LJXTHG) were inoculated by spray with two strains of Ken 54-04 and Hoku 1 in seedling stages. Based on the R:S ratios of segregation in F1, F2 and RIL populations it was showed that there were two independent dominant genes in Heikezijing in responsible for resistance to strain Ken 54-04 and one dominant R gene to strain Hoku 1 which is the same to one of the two genes resistant to Ken 54-04. The allelic test indicated that the gene with resistance to both Hoku 1 and Ken 54-04 is non-allelic to loci of Pi-k, Pi-z, Pi-ta, Pi-b and Pi-t, also neither Pi-i nor Pi-a gene. It is necessary to confirm whether it is an unknown gene.
15973995	[Marker-assisted selection and pyramiding for three blast resistance genes, Pi-d(t)1, Pi-b, Pi-ta2, in rice].	2004	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	G46B is a promising holding line used for three-lines breeding strategy in hybrid rice, but it is susceptible to blast disease caused by Pyricularia grisea. To improve its blast resistance, three rice varieties, Digu, BL-1, and Pi-4, with blast resistance genes, Pi-d(t), Pi-b, and Pi-ta2, respectively, were used to be crossed with G46B, and 15 plants with these three blast resistance genes, Pi-d(t)1, Pi-b, and Pi-ta2, were selected from their F2 and B1C1 populations via a marker-aided crossing procedure. Among them, four plants were heterozygotes in the three resistance genes, with the genotype of Pi-d(t)1 pi-d(t)/Pi-b pi-b/ Pi-ta2 pi-ta2; ten plants were heterozygotes in two of the three resistance genes, of which six with the genotype of Pi-d(t)1 Pi-d(t)1/Pi-b pi-b/Pi-ta2 pi-ta2, three with the genotype of Pi-d(t)1 pi-d(t)1/Pi-b pi-b/Pi-ta2 Pi-ta2, and one with the genotype of Pi-d(t)1pi-d(t)1/Pi-b Pi-b/Pi-ta2 pi-ta2; and only one plant was homozygote in two of the three resistance genes with the genotype of Pi-d(t)1 Pi-d(t)/Pi-b pi-b/Pi-ta2 Pi-ta2. These results demonstrate the capacity of maker-assisted selection (MAS) in gene pyramiding for rice blast resistance and its enhancement for the efficiency in rice resistance breeding.
17572362	Comparative analysis of the 100 kb region containing the Pi-k(h) locus between indica and japonica rice lines.	2007	Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics	We have recently cloned a pathogen inducible blast resistance gene Pi-k(h) from the indica rice line Tetep using a positional cloning approach. In this study, we carried out structural organization analysis of the Pi-k(h) locus in both indica and japonica rice lines. A 100 kb region containing 50 kb upstream and 50 kb downstream sequences flanking to the Pi-k(h) locus was selected for the investigation. A total of 16 genes in indica and 15 genes in japonica were predicted and annotated in this region. The average GC content of indica and japonica genes in this region was 53.15% and 49.3%, respectively. Both indica and japonica sequences were polymorphic for simple sequence repeats having mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotides. Sequence analysis of the specific blast resistant Pi-k(h) allele of Tetep and the susceptible Pi-k(h) allele of the japonica rice line Nipponbare showed differences in the number and distribution of motifs involved in phosphorylation, resulting in the resistance phenotype in Tetep.
18271255	[Expression and autophosphorylation analysis of XA21 and PI-D2 protein kinases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae].	2007	Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Rice bacterial blight and blast are the most crucial rice disease. Xa21 confers resistance to bacterial blight, while Pi-d2 confers resistance to rice blast. Both Xa21 and Pi-d2 encode receptor kinase-like proteins. Biochemical properties of XA21 kinase expressed in bacterial were characterized in our previous report. In this study, both XA21 and PI-D2 kinase domain were PCR amplified and cloned into yeast expression vector pEGH via recombinational cloning strategy, kinase proteins expressed in eukaryotic yeast system was purified and autophosphorylation assay was carried out. The results indicated that XA21 and PI-D2 protein can be detected by SDS-PAGE and showed expected molecular weight. Autophosphorylation assay indicated that yeast expressed XA21 and PI-D2 were active when incubated with P32 labelled ATP. The experiment provided basic materials for biochemical prosperity analysis, protein-protein interaction and substrate screening research.
18332008	[Initial functional analysis of the promoter region and coding region of Pib gene in transgenic rice].	2008	Yi Chuan	The promoter region and intact coding region of Pib gene (9.9 kb) was inserted into the downstream of CaMV 35S promoter in a binary vector pPZP2Ha3(+), resulting a plasmid pNAR701. And a fragment of Pib gene from 6 986 to 9 392 bp was placed into pPZP2Ha3(-) under the control of CaMV 35S promoter, producing an antisense expression vector pNAR703. These two recombined vectors were transferred into a blast medium susceptible rice cultivar R109 by an Agrobecterium-mediated method. Tests of PCR and Southern blotting for transgenic plants as well as the segregation of hygromycin resistance in T1 generation confirmed that the target DNA fragments were integrated into genome of R109 and hereditable. Northern blotting analysis showed the coding region of Pib gene double driven by 35S and its native promoter was able to transcript in T1 transgenic plants. Rice blast resistance test for T1 transgenic seedlings of 3-4 leaves stage and in vitro leaves in tillering stage showed that transgenic plants of pNAR701 were more resistant to blast race ZD1 and ZG1 than the wild type plants, but the resistance of antisense transgenic plants from pNAR703 was decreased compared to the controls.
18349514	A rice blast-resistance genetic resource from wild rice in Yunnan, China.	2007	Zhi Wu Sheng Li Yu Fen Zi Sheng Wu Xue Xue Bao	Compared to Pi-ta(-) alleles, Pi-ta(+) alleles can cause blast resistance response. In this work, Pi-ta gene in multiple rice materials, including local rice cultivars, different types of O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata was detected by molecular cloning and sequence analysis. Results indicated that Pi-ta(+) alleles were rare alleles, because in all the tested materials, only the 'Erect' type of O. rufipogon (ETOR) from Jinghong county in Yunnan province contains a Pi-ta(+) allele. Another rice blast resistance gene, Pib, confers resistance to the Japanese strain of M. grisea, was also confirmed to be functional in this type of O. rufipogon. The results of pathogen inoculation test show that ETOR is more strongly resistant to the tested blast pathogen races than other types of O. rufipogon. The resistance of ETOR may at least partially depend upon the functioning of Pi-ta and Pib gene. As O. rufipogon has the same type of genome with the cultivated rice (O. sativa), Pi-ta(+) and Pib gene in Erect type of O. rufipogon can be used to improve the tolerance of cultivated rice to blast, either by traditional hybridization or by genetic engineering.
18443412	Development of near-isogenic Japonica rice lines with enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.	2008	Mol Cells	Thirteen near-isogenic lines (NILs) of japonica rice were developed via a backcross method using the recurrent parent Chucheong, which is of good eating quality but is susceptible to Magnaporthe grisea, and three blast resistant japonica donors, Seolak, Daeseong and Bongkwang. The agro-morphological traits of these NILs, such as heading date, culm length, and panicle length, were similar to those of Chucheong. In a genome-wide scan using 158 SSR markers, chromosome segments of Chucheong were identified in most polymorphic regions of the 13 NIL plants, and only a few chromosome segments were found to have been substituted by donor alleles. The genetic similarities of the 13 NILs to the recurrent parent Chucheong averaged 0.961, with a range of 0.932-0.984. Analysis of 13 major blast resistance (R) genes in these lines using specific DNA markers showed that each NIL appeared to contain some combination of the four R genes, Pib, Pii, Pik-m and Pita-2, with the first three genes being present in each line. Screening of nine M. grisea isolates revealed that one NIL M7 was resistant to all nine isolates; the remaining NILs were each resistant to between three and seven isolates, except for NIL M106, which was resistant to only two isolates. In a blast nursery experiment, all the NILs proved to be more resistant than Chucheong. These newly developed NILs have potential as commercial rice varieties because of their increased resistance to M. grisea combined with the desirable agronomic traits of Chucheong. They also provide material for studying the genetic basis of blast resistance.
22196797	Study on the interaction between methyl jasmonate and the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36 by spectroscopic methods.	2012	Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc	Interaction between the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36 and methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) was studied by fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopic techniques. The quenching mechanism of fluorescence of MeJA by this domain was discussed to be a static quenching procedure. Fluorescence quenching was explored to measure the number of binding sites n and apparent binding constants K. The thermodynamics parameters ΔH, ΔG, ΔS were also calculated. The results indicate the binding reaction was not entropy-driven but enthalpy-driven, and hydrophobic binding played major role in the interaction. The binding sites of MeJA with the coiled-coil structural domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36 were found to approach the microenvironment of both Tyr and Trp by the synchronous fluorescence spectrometry. The distance r between donor (the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein Pi36) and acceptor (MeJA) was obtained according to Förster theory of non-radioactive energy transfer.
22592658	A novel blast resistance gene, Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	The dominant rice blast resistance gene, Pi54 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in different parts of India. In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of Pi54 named as Pi54rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation. The Pi54rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C(3)H type) domain. The 1,447 bp Pi54rh transcript comprises of 101 bp 5'-UTR, 1,083 bp coding region and 263 bp 3'-UTR, driven by pathogen inducible promoter. We showed the extracellular localization of Pi54rh protein and the presence of glycosylation, myristoylation and phosphorylation sites which implicates its role in signal transduction process. This is in contrast to other blast resistance genes that are predicted to be intracellular NBS-LRR-type resistance proteins. The Pi54rh was found to express constitutively at basal level in the leaves, but upregulates 3.8-fold at 96 h post-inoculation with the pathogen. Functional validation of cloned Pi54rh gene using complementation test showed high degree of resistance to seven isolates of M. oryzae collected from different geographical locations of India. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice provides broad spectrum resistance to M. oryzae hence can be used in rice improvement breeding programme.
22667447	Identification of the rice blast resistance gene Pib in the National Small Grains Collection.	2012	Phytopathology	The Pib gene in rice confers resistance to a wide range of races of the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, including race IE1k that overcomes Pita, another broad-spectrum resistance gene. In this study, the presence of Pib was determined in 164 rice germplasm accessions from a core subset of the National Small Grains Collection utilizing DNA markers and pathogenicity assays. The presence of Pib was evaluated with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a dominant marker (Pib-dom) derived from the Pib gene sequence. Pathogenicity assays using two avirulent races (IE1k and IB1) and a virulent race (IB54) were performed to verify the resistance responses of accessions. Of the 164 accessions evaluated, 109 contained the Pib gene as determined using both SSR markers and pathogenicity assays, albeit different haplotypes were detected. The remaining 52 germplasm accessions were different in their responses to the blast races IB54, IE1k, and IB1, thus indicating the presence of R gene(s) other than Pib. The accessions characterized in this study could be used for marker-assisted breeding to improve blast resistance in indica and japonica cultivars worldwide.
22779744	Molecular mapping of the blast resistance genes Pi2-1 and Pi51(t) in the durably resistant rice 'Tianjingyeshengdao'.	2012	Phytopathology	Tianjingyeshengdao' (TY) is a rice cultivar with durable resistance to populations of Magnaporthe oryzae (the causal agent of blast) in China. To understand the genetic basis of its resistance to blast, we developed a population of recombinant inbred lines from a cross between TY and the highly susceptible 'CO39' for gene mapping analysis. In total, 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rice blast resistance were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 12 from the evaluation of four disease parameters in both greenhouse and blast nursery conditions. Among these QTLs, 19 were contributed by TY and three by CO39. Two QTL clusters on chromosome 6 and 12 were named Pi2-1 and Pi51(t), respectively. Pi2-1 was detected under both growth chamber and natural blast nursery conditions, and explained 31.24 to 59.73% of the phenotypic variation. Pi51(t) was only detected in the natural blast nursery and explained 3.67 to 10.37% of the phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate that the durable resistance in TY is controlled by two major and seven minor genes. Identification of the markers linked to both Pi2-1 and Pi51(t) in this study should be useful for marker-aided selection in rice breeding programs as well as for molecular cloning of the identified resistance genes.
22976392	Mutation in OsLMS, a gene encoding a protein with two double-stranded RNA binding motifs, causes lesion mimic phenotype and early senescence in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Genes Genet Syst	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) lesion mimic and senescence (lms) EMS-mutant, identified in a japonica cultivar Hitomebore, is characterized by a spontaneous lesion mimic phenotype during its vegetative growth, an accelerated senescence after flowering, and enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). To isolate the OsLMS gene, we crossed the lms mutant to Kasalath (indica), and used mutant F(2) plants to initially map the candidate region to about 322-kb on the long arm of chromosome 2. Illumina whole-genome re-sequencing of the mutant and aligning the reads to Hitomebore reference sequence within the candidate region delineated by linkage analysis identified a G to A nucleotide substitution. The mutation corresponded to the exon-intron splicing junction of a novel gene that encodes a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase domain and two double stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBM) containing protein. By PCR amplification, we confirmed that the mutation causes splicing error that is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines with suppressed expression of LMS gene exhibited the lesion mimic phenotype, confirming that the mutation identified in LMS is responsible for the mutant phenotype. OsLMS shares a moderate amino-acid similarity to the Arabidopsis FIERY2/CPL1 gene, which is known to control many plant processes such as stress response and development. Consistence with this similarity, the lms mutant shows sensitivity to cold stress at the early growth stage, suggesting that LMS is a negative regulator of stress response in rice.
15101094	A CHASE domain containing protein kinase OsCRL4, represents a new AtCRE1-like gene family in rice.	2004	J Zhejiang Univ Sci	AtCRE1 is known to be a cytokinin receptor in Arabidopsis. The AtCRE1 protein contains CHASE domain at the N-terminal part, followed by a transmitter (histidine kinase) domain and two receiver domains. The N-terminal CHASE domain of AtCRE1 contains putative recognition sites for cytokinin. Five CHASE domains containing proteins were found in rice, OsCRL1a, OsCRL1b, OsCRL2, OsCRL3, and OsCRL4. OsCRL1a, OsCRL1b, OsCRL2 and OsCRL3 contain the four domains existing in CRE1, whereas OsCRL4 only contains the CHASE domain and a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase domain. The authors cloned the encoding gene OsCRL4 and found that it represents a new member of the cytokinin receptor protein in rice.
17408920	The two-component signal system in rice (Oryza sativa L.): a genome-wide study of cytokinin signal perception and transduction.	2007	Genomics	In this report we define the genes of two-component regulatory systems in rice through a comprehensive computational analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome sequence databases. Thirty-seven genes were identified, including 5 HKs (cytokinin-response histidine protein kinase) (OsHK1-4, OsHKL1), 5 HPs (histidine phosphotransfer proteins) (OsHP1-5), 15 type-A RRs (response regulators) (OsRR1-15), 7 type B RR genes (OsRR16-22), and 5 predicted pseudo-response regulators (OsPRR1-5). Protein motif organization, gene structure, phylogenetic analysis, chromosomal location, and comparative analysis between rice, maize, and Arabidopsis are described. Full-length cDNA clones of each gene were isolated from rice. Heterologous expression of each of the OsHKs in yeast mutants conferred histidine kinase function in a cytokinin-dependent manner. Nonconserved regions of individual cDNAs were used as probes in expression profiling experiments. This work provides a foundation for future functional dissection of the rice cytokinin two-component signaling pathway.
21357645	Phytochromes regulate SA and JA signaling pathways in rice and are required for developmentally controlled resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.	2011	Mol Plant	Old leaves of wild-type rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) are more resistant to blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) than new leaves. In contrast, both old and new leaves of the rice phytochrome triple mutant (phyAphyBphyC) are susceptible to blast fungus. We demonstrate that pathogenesis-related class 1 (PR1) proteins are rapidly and strongly induced during M. grisea infection and following exogenous jasmonate (JA) or salicylic acid (SA) exposure in the old leaves, but not in the new leaves of the wild-type. In contrast, the accumulation of PR1 proteins was significantly attenuated in old and new leaves of the phyAphyBphyC mutant. These results suggest that phytochromes are required for the induction of PR1 proteins in rice. Basal transcription levels of PR1a and PR1b were substantially higher in the wild-type as compared to the phyAphyBphyC mutant, suggesting that phytochromes also are required for basal expression of PR1 genes. Moreover, the transcript levels of genes known to function in SA- or JA-dependent defense pathways were regulated by leaf age and functional phytochromes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that phytochromes are required in rice for age-related resistance to M. grisea and may indirectly increase PR1 gene expression by regulating SA- and JA-dependent defense pathways.
17263873	Genome-wide identification and analyses of the rice calmodulin and related potential calcium sensor proteins.	2007	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: A wide range of stimuli evoke rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]cyt in plant cells which are transmitted by protein sensors that contain EF-hand motifs. Here, a group of Oryza sativa L. genes encoding calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like (CML) proteins that do not possess functional domains other than the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs was analyzed.

RESULTS: By functional analyses and BLAST searches of the TIGR rice database, a maximum number of 243 proteins that possibly have EF-hand motifs were identified in the rice genome. Using a neighbor-joining tree based on amino acid sequence similarity, five loci were defined as Cam genes and thirty two additional CML genes were identified. Extensive analyses of the gene structures, the chromosome locations, the EF-hand motif organization, expression characteristics including analysis by RT-PCR and a comparative analysis of Cam and CML genes in rice and Arabidopsis are presented.

CONCLUSION: Although many proteins have unknown functions, the complexity of this gene family indicates the importance of Ca2+-signals in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and this family of proteins likely plays a critical role as their transducers.
22807623	AP2/ERF Transcription Factor in Rice: Genome-Wide Canvas and Syntenic Relationships between Monocots and Eudicots.	2012	Evol Bioinform Online	The transcription factor family intimately regulates gene expression in response to hormones, biotic and abiotic factors, symbiotic interactions, cell differentiation, and stress signalling pathways in plants. In this study, 170 AP2/ERF family genes are identified by phylogenetic analysis of the rice genome (Oryza sativa l. japonica) and they are divided into a total of 11 groups, including four major groups (AP2, ERF, DREB, and RAV), 10 subgroups, and two soloists. Gene structure analysis revealed that, at position-6, the amino acid threonine (Thr-6) is conserved in the double domain AP2 proteins compared to the amino acid arginine (Arg-6), which is preserved in the single domain of ERF proteins. In addition, the histidine (His) amino acid is found in both domains of the double domain AP2 protein, which is missing in single domain ERF proteins. Motif analysis indicates that most of the conserved motifs, apart from the AP2/ERF domain, are exclusively distributed among the specific clades in the phylogenetic tree and regulate plausible functions. Expression analysis reveals a widespread distribution of the rice AP2/ERF family genes within plant tissues. In the vegetative organs, the transcripts of these genes are found most abundant in the roots followed by the leaf and stem; whereas, in reproductive tissues, the gene expression of this family is observed high in the embryo and lemma. From chromosomal localization, it appears that repetition and tandem-duplication may contribute to the evolution of new genes in the rice genome. In this study, interspecies comparisons between rice and wheat reveal 34 rice loci and unveil the extent of collinearity between the two genomes. It was subsequently ascertained that chromosome-9 has more orthologous loci for CRT/DRE genes whereas chromosome-2 exhibits orthologs for ERF subfamily members. Maximum conserved synteny is found in chromosome-3 for AP2 double domain subfamily genes. Macrosynteny between rice and Arabidopsis, a distant, related genome, uncovered 11 homologs/orthologs loci in both genomes. The distribution of AP2/ERF family gene paralogs in Arabidopsis was most frequent in chromosome-1 followed by chromosome-5. In Arabidopsis, ERF subfamily gene orthologs are found on chromosome-1, chromosome-3, and chromosome-5, whereas DRE subfamily genes are found on chromosome-2 and chromosome-5. Orthologs for RAV and AP2 with double domains in Arabidopsis are located on chromosome-1 and chromosome-3, respectively. In conclusion, the data generated in this survey will be useful for conducting genomic research to determine the precise role of the AP2/ERF gene during stress responses with the ultimate goal of improving crops.
22215967	Genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analysis of the ERF gene family in cucumbers.	2011	Genet Mol Biol	Members of the ERF transcription-factor family participate in a number of biological processes, viz., responses to hormones, adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress, metabolism regulation, beneficial symbiotic interactions, cell differentiation and developmental processes. So far, no tissue-expression profile of any cucumber ERF protein has been reported in detail. Recent completion of the cucumber full-genome sequence has come to facilitate, not only genome-wide analysis of ERF family members in cucumbers themselves, but also a comparative analysis with those in Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, 103 hypothetical ERF family genes in the cucumber genome were identified, phylogenetic analysis indicating their classification into 10 groups, designated I to X. Motif analysis further indicated that most of the conserved motifs outside the AP2/ERF domain, are selectively distributed among the specific clades in the phylogenetic tree. From chromosomal localization and genome distribution analysis, it appears that tandem-duplication may have contributed to CsERF gene expansion. Intron/exon structure analysis indicated that a few CsERFs still conserved the former intron-position patterns existent in the common ancestor of monocots and eudicots. Expression analysis revealed the widespread distribution of the cucumber ERF gene family within plant tissues, thereby implying the probability of their performing various roles therein. Furthermore, members of some groups presented mutually similar expression patterns that might be related to their phylogenetic groups.
18936491	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Submergence-tolerant rice maintains viability during complete submergence by limiting underwater elongation until floodwaters recede. Acclimation responses to submergence are coordinated by the submergence-inducible Sub1A, which encodes an ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor (ERF). Sub1A is limited to tolerant genotypes and sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant accessions. Here we evaluated the role of Sub1A in the integration of ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA) signaling during submergence. The submergence-stimulated decrease in ABA content was Sub1A-independent, whereas GA-mediated underwater elongation was significantly restricted by Sub1A. Transgenics that ectopically express Sub1A displayed classical GA-insensitive phenotypes, leading to the hypothesis that Sub1A limits the response to GA. Notably Sub1A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice-1 (SLR1) and SLR1 Like-1 (SLRL1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions. In the Sub1A overexpression line, SLR1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain. In the presence of Sub1A, the increase in these GA signaling repressors and decrease in GA responsiveness were stimulated by ethylene, which promotes Sub1A expression. Conversely, ethylene promoted GA responsiveness and shoot elongation in submergence-intolerant lines. Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR1 and SLRL1.
17303594	Characterization of OsPID, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	PINOID, a serine threonine protein kinase in Arabidopsis, controls auxin distribution through a positive control of subcellular localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers. Compared with the rapid progress in understanding mechanisms of auxin action in dicot species, little is known about auxin action in monocot species. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of OsPID, the PINOID ortholog of rice. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genome contains a single PID ortholog, OsPID. Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism. Abnormalities observed in the plants that overexpress OsPID could be phenocopied by treatment with an inhibitor of active polar transport of auxin, indicating that OsPID could be involved in the control of polar auxin transport in rice. Analysis of OsPID mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot.
12684786	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2.	2003	Planta	We previously showed that two major cysteine endopeptidases, REP-1 and REP-2, were present in germinated rice ( Oryza sativa L.) seeds, and that REP-1 was the enzyme that digests seed storage proteins. The present study shows that REP-2 is an asparaginyl endopeptidase that acts as an activator of REP-1, and we separated it into two forms, REP-2alpha (39 kDa) and REP-2beta (40 kDa), using ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Although analysis of the amino terminals revealed that 10 amino acids of both forms were identical, their isoelectric points were different. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using an antiserum raised against legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase from jack bean, indicated that both forms were present in maturing and germinating rice seeds, and that their amounts transiently decreased in dry seeds. Northern blot analysis indicated that REP-2 mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds. In germinating seeds, the mRNA was detected in aleurone layers but not in shoot and root tissues. Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10(-6) M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas REP-2beta levels declined rapidly. Southern blot analysis showed that there is one gene for REP-2 in the genome, indicating that both REP-2 enzymes are generated from a single gene. The structure of the gene was similar to that of beta-VPE and gamma-VPE isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana.
22408071	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1.	2012	Plant Cell	Seed shattering is an important agricultural trait in crop domestication. SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication. However, the regulatory pathways of seed shattering in rice remain unknown. Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line. The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice. Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4. We also identified a frameshift mutant of SH4 that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering. Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification. qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation.
16262715	Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice.	2005	Plant J	The rice SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice. However, in rice genome databases we identified two sequences homologous to SLR1: SLR1-like1 and -2 (SLRL1 and -2). SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins. The expression of SLRL1 was positively regulated by GA at the mRNA level and occurred preferentially in reproductive organs, whereas SLRL2 was moderately expressed in mature leaf organs and was not affected by GA. Transformation of SLRL1 into the slr1 mutant rescued the slender phenotype of this mutant. Moreover, overexpression of SLRL1 in normal rice plants induced a dwarf phenotype with an increased level of OsGA20ox2 gene expression and diminished the GA-induced shoot elongation, suggesting that SLRL1 acts as a repressor of GA signaling. Consistent with the fact that SLRL1 does not have a DELLA domain, which is essential for degradation of DELLA proteins, a level of SLRL1 protein was not degraded by application of gibberellic acid. However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated SLR1 lacking the DELLA domain. Based on these characteristics of SLRL1, the functional roles of SLRL1 in GA signaling in rice are discussed.
19665023	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro.	2009	FEBS Lett	Cytosolic thioredoxins are small conserved proteins that are involved in cellular redox regulation. Here, we report that a major and cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, has an inhibitory activity on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro. This inhibition effects were redox-dependent and did not involve stable physical interaction. The data suggested a novel mechanism for redox regulation of MAPKs in plants.
17449649	Molecular evolution of lysin motif-type receptor-like kinases in plants.	2007	Plant Physiol	The lysin motif (LysM) domain is an ancient and ubiquitous protein module that binds peptidoglycan and structurally related molecules. A genomic survey in a large number of species spanning all kingdoms reveals that the combination of LysM and receptor kinase domains is present exclusively in plants. However, the particular biological functions and molecular evolution of this gene family remain largely unknown. We show that LysM domains in plant LysM proteins are highly diversified and that a minimum of six distinct types of LysM motifs exist in plant LysM kinase proteins and five additional types of LysM motifs exist in nonkinase plant LysM proteins. Further, motif similarities suggest that plant LysM motifs are ancient. Although phylogenetic signals are not sufficient to resolve the earliest relationships, plant LysM motifs may have arisen through common ancestry with LysM motifs in other kingdoms. Within plants, the gene family has evolved through local and segmental duplications. The family has undergone further duplication and diversification in legumes, where some LysM kinase genes function as receptors for bacterial nodulation factor. Two pairs of homeologous regions were identified in soybean (Glycine max) based on microsynteny and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Expression data show that most plant LysM kinase genes are expressed predominantly in the root and that orthologous LysM kinase genes share similar tissue expression patterns. We also examined synteny around plant LysM kinase genes to help reconstruct scenarios for the evolution of this important gene family.
22576235	A PCR-based marker for a locus conferring the aroma in Myanmar rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Aromatic rice is an important commodity for international trade, which has encouraged the interest of rice breeders to identify the genetic control of rice aroma. The recessive Os2AP gene, which is located on chromosome 8, has been reported to be associated with rice aroma. The 8-bp deletion in exon 7 is an aromatic allele that is present in most aromatic accessions, including the most popular aromatic rice varieties, Jasmine and Basmati. However, other mutations associated with aroma have been detected, but the other mutations are less frequent. In this study, we report an aromatic allele, a 3-bp insertion in exon 13 of Os2AP, as a major allele found in aromatic rice varieties from Myanmar. The insertion is in frame and causes an additional tyrosine (Y) in the amino acid sequence. However, the mutation does not affect the expression of the Os2AP gene. A functional marker for detecting this allele was developed and tested in an aroma-segregating F(2) population. The aroma phenotypes and genotypes showed perfect co-segregation of this population. The marker was also used for screening a collection of aromatic rice varieties collected from different geographical sites of Myanmar. Twice as many aromatic Myanmar rice varieties containing the 3-bp insertion allele were found as the varieties containing the 8-bp deletion allele, which suggested that the 3-bp insertion allele originated in regions of Myanmar.
22570445	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene.	2012	Plant Cell	In plants, the transition to reproductive growth is of particular importance for successful seed production. Transformation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to the inflorescence meristem (IM) is the crucial first step in this transition. Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa). PAP2 is a MADS box gene belonging to a grass-specific subclade of the SEPALLATA subfamily. Suppression of these three AP1/FUL-like genes by RNA interference caused a slight delay in reproductive transition. Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM. In the quadruple knockdown lines, the meristem continued to generate leaves, rather than becoming an IM. Consequently, multiple shoots were formed instead of an inflorescence. PAP2 physically interacts with MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo. Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in pap2-1 mutants. Based on these results, we propose that PAP2 and the three AP1/FUL-like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.
22641204	One gene's shattering effects.	2012	Nat Genet	A new study shows that three independent mutations in the Sh1 gene, which encodes a YABBY transcription factor, gave rise to the non-shattering seed phenotype in domesticated sorghum. This same gene may have also had a role in the domestication of other cereals, including maize and rice.
22558386	silencing COI1 in rice increases susceptibility to chewing insects and impairs inducible defense.	2012	PLoS One	The jasmonic acid (JA) pathway plays a key role in plant defense responses against herbivorous insects. CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) is an F-box protein essential for all jasmonate responses. However, the precise defense function of COI1 in monocotyledonous plants, especially in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is largely unknown. We silenced OsCOI1 in rice plants via RNA interference (RNAi) to determine the role of OsCOI1 in rice defense against rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, a chewing insect, and brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a phloem-feeding insect. In wild-type rice plants (WT), the transcripts of OsCOI1 were strongly and continuously up-regulated by LF infestation and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, but not by BPH infestation. The abundance of trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI), and the enzymatic activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were enhanced in response to both LF and BPH infestation, but the activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) was only induced by LF. The RNAi lines with repressed expression of OsCOI1 showed reduced resistance against LF, but no change against BPH. Silencing OsCOI1 did not alter LF-induced LOX activity and JA content, but it led to a reduction in the TrypPI content, POD and PPO activity by 62.3%, 48.5% and 27.2%, respectively. In addition, MeJA-induced TrypPI and POD activity were reduced by 57.2% and 48.2% in OsCOI1 RNAi plants. These results suggest that OsCOI1 is an indispensable signaling component, controlling JA-regulated defense against chewing insect (LF) in rice plants, and COI1 is also required for induction of TrypPI, POD and PPO in rice defense response to LF infestation.
22685166	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	In Arabidopsis thaliana, the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) plays a critical role in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway by negatively regulating the activities of bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 family transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream BR-responsive genes. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), which is one of the orthologs of BIN2. Overexpression of GSK2 (Go) led to plants with typical BR loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppression of GSK2 resulted in enhanced BR signaling phenotypes. DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT) is a positive regulator that mediates several BR responses in rice. Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses. Indeed, GSK2 can interact with DLT and phosphorylate DLT. Moreover, brassinolide treatment can induce the dephosphorylation of DLT, leading to the accumulation of dephosphorylated DLT protein. In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level. These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses.
22644768	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsCHR4, a rice chromatin-remodeling factor required for early chloroplast development in adaxial mesophyll.	2012	Planta	Mi-2 protein, the central component of the NuRD nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex, plays a role in transcriptional repression in animals. Mi-2-like genes have been reported in Arabidopsis, though their function in monocots remains largely unknown. In the present study, a rice Mi-2-like gene, OsCHR4 (Oryza sativa Chromatin Remodeling 4, LOC_Os07g03450), was cloned from a rice mutant with adaxial albino leaves. The Oschr4 mutant exhibited defective chloroplasts in adaxial mesophyll, but not in abaxial mesophyll. Ultrastructural observations indicated that proplastid growth and/or thylakoid membrane formation in adaxial mesophyll cells was blocked in the Oschr4 mutant. Subcellular localization revealed that OsCHR4::GFP fusion protein was targeted to the nuclei. OsCHR4 was mainly expressed in the root meristem, flower, vascular bundle, and mesophyll cells by promoter::GUS analysis in transgenic rice. The transcripts of some nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes required for early chloroplast development and photosynthesis were decreased in the adaxial albino mesophyll of the Oschr4 mutant. These observations provide evidence that OsCHR4, the rice Mi-2-like protein, plays an important role in early chloroplast development in adaxial mesophyll cells. The results increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying tissue-specific chloroplast development in plants.
22525239	Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum.	2012	Plant Sci	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are important negative regulators in the MAPK signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in plant growth, regulation of development and response to environment stresses. Several MAPKs have been reported to be involved in the drought stress response, however, there is no evidence for the specific function of MKPs in drought stress. Here, a putative MKP in rice (Oryza sativa), OsIBR5, was characterized. Expression of OsIBR5 was induced by PEG6000, abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Overexpression of OsIBR5 in tobacco plants resulted in hypersensitivity to drought and H(2)O(2) treatments. Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls. Moreover, OsIBR5 was found to interact with tobacco MAPKs SIPK and WIPK, and drought-induced WIPK activity was impaired in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants. These results indicated that OsIBR5 is a MKP which was induced by abiotic stresses and decreased tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants.
22649273	A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, OsPht1;1, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	A number of phosphate (Pi) starvation- or mycorrhiza-regulated Pi transporters belonging to the Pht1 family have been functionally characterized in several plant species, whereas functions of the Pi transporters that are not regulated by changes in Pi supply are lacking. In this study, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Pht1;1 (OsPT1), one of the 13 Pht1 Pi transporters in rice, was expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots. OsPT1 was able to complement the proton-coupled Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake. Transgenic plants of OsPT1 overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild-type control in Pi-sufficient shoots. These responses of the transgenic plants to Pi supply were further confirmed by the changes in depolarization of root cell membrane potential, root hair occurrence, (33)P uptake rate and transportation, as well as phosphorus accumulation in young leaves at Pi-sufficient levels. Furthermore, OsPT1 expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that OsPT1 is involved in the OsPHO2-regulated Pi pathway. These results indicate that OsPT1 is a key member of the Pht1 family involved in Pi uptake and translocation in rice under Pi-replete conditions.
22653607	Binding mechanism between Hsp90 and Sgt1 explored by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations in rice.	2012	J Mol Model	The Hsp90 (for heat shock protein90) and the Sgt1 (for suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1) are widely distributed in animals, yeast, and plants. The former functions as molecular chaperon activating a series of client proteins, the latter functions as an adaptor protein participating in multiple biological processes such as immunity response through interactions with different protein complexes. In the present study, we have constructed a homology model of Hsp90-Sgt1 complex in rice based on a recently resolved structure from barley and Arabidopsis to explore its binding mechanisms and to understand the detailed interaction profile. A total of 20 ns explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations combined with MM-GBSA computations and virtual alanine scanning were performed for the modeled complex. In the final structure, three strong salt bridges were found between OsHsp90 and OsSgt1, D217(OsHsp90)-K186(OsSgt1), D218(OsHsp90)-K237(OsSgt1) and K161(OsHsp90)-E239(OsSgt1). Besides, residue Y173 of OsSgt1 played a vital role in the interactions with OsHsp90, the detailed interactions were discussed. These results would help us understand the critical features determining the Hsp90-Sgt1 binding process.
22551250	Snapshots of gene expression in rice: limitations for allelic expression imbalance determination.	2012	Genome	In an initial investigation of differential expression of genes caused by cis-acting regulatory elements in rice, the lack of reproducibility led us to question the basic premise of allelic expression imbalance determination: namely that departures of cDNA expression ratios from those observed in genomic DNA provide unequivocal evidence of cis-acting polymorphisms. This paper describes experiments designed to demonstrate that stochastic variation in low copy number of targets in PCR reactions give variable allelic ratios even when starting with the same copy numbers of the two alleles. These significant departures from an expected 1:1 ratio provide an explanation to the lack of reproducibility observed for our cDNA measurements.
22551450	The overexpression of OsNAC9 alters the root architecture of rice plants enhancing drought resistance and grain yield under field conditions.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Drought conditions limit agricultural production by preventing crops from reaching their genetically predetermined maximum yields. Here, we present the results of field evaluations of rice overexpressing OsNAC9, a member of the rice NAC domain family. Root-specific (RCc3) and constitutive (GOS2) promoters were used to overexpress OsNAC9 and produced the transgenic RCc3:OsNAC9 and GOS2:OsNAC9 plants. Field evaluations over two cultivating seasons showed that grain yields of the RCc3:OsNAC9 and the GOS2:OsNAC9 plants were increased by 13%-18% and 13%-32% under normal conditions, respectively. Under drought conditions, RCc3:OsNAC9 plants showed an increased grain yield of 28%-72%, whilst the GOS2:OsNAC9 plants remained unchanged. Both transgenic lines exhibited altered root architecture involving an enlarged stele and aerenchyma. The aerenchyma of RCc3:OsNAC9 roots was enlarged to a greater extent than those of GOS2:OsNAC9 and non-transgenic (NT) roots, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought resistance. Microarray experiments identified 40 up-regulated genes by more than threefold (P < 0.01) in the roots of both transgenic lines. These included 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, an ABA biosynthesis gene, calcium-transporting ATPase, a component of the Ca(2+) signalling pathway involved in cortical cell death and aerenchyma formation, cinnamoyl CoA reductase 1, a gene involved in lignin biosynthesis, and wall-associated kinases¸ genes involved in cell elongation and morphogenesis. Interestingly, O-methyltransferase, a gene necessary for barrier formation, was specifically up-regulated only in the RCc3:OsNAC9 roots. Such up-regulated genes that are commonly and specifically up-regulated in OsNAC9 transgenic roots may account for the altered root architecture conferring increased drought resistance phenotype.
22644442	Functional screening of cDNA library from a salt tolerant rice genotype Pokkali identifies mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase gene (OsMPG1) as a key member of salinity stress response.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Salinity, one of the most deleterious stresses, affects growth and overall yield of crop plants. To identify new "candidate genes" having potential role in salinity tolerance, we have carried out 'functional screening' of a cDNA library (made from a salt tolerant rice-Pokkali). Based on this screening, we identified a cDNA clone that was allowing yeast cells to grow in the presence of 1.2 M NaCl. Sequencing and BLAST search identified it as mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase (OsMPG1) gene from rice. Analysis of rice genome sequence database indicated the presence of 3 additional genes for MPG. Out of four, three MPG genes viz. OsMPG1, 3 and 4 were able to functionally complement yeast MPG mutant -YDL055C. We have carried out detailed transcript profiling of all members of MPG family by qRT-PCR using two contrasting rice genotypes (IR64 and Pokkali) under different abiotic stresses (salinity, drought, oxidative stress, heat stress, cold or UV light). These MPG genes showed differential expression under various abiotic stresses with two genes (OsMPG1 and 3) showing high induction in response to multiple stresses. Analysis of rice microarray data indicated higher expression levels for OsMPG1 in specific tissues such as roots, leaves, shoot apical meristem and different stages of panicle and seed development, thereby indicating its developmental regulation. Functional validation of OsMPG1 carried out by overexpression in the transgenic tobacco revealed its involvement in enhancing salinity stress tolerance.
22623516	The Arabidopsis ortholog of rice DWARF27 acts upstream of MAX1 in the control of plant development by strigolactones.	2012	Plant Physiol	Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived plant hormones that regulate shoot branching, secondary growth, root development, and responses to soil phosphate. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), SL biosynthesis requires the sequential action of two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH3 (MAX3) and MAX4, followed by a cytochrome P450, MAX1. In rice (Oryza sativa), the plastid-localized protein DWARF27 (OsD27) is also necessary for SL biosynthesis, but the equivalent gene in Arabidopsis has not been identified. Here, we use phylogenetic analysis of D27-like sequences from photosynthetic organisms to identify AtD27, the likely Arabidopsis ortholog of OsD27. Using reverse genetics, we show that AtD27 is required for the inhibition of secondary bud outgrowth and that exogenous application of the synthetic SL GR24 can rescue the increased branching phenotype of an Atd27 mutant. Furthermore, we use grafting to demonstrate that AtD27 operates on a nonmobile precursor upstream of MAX1 in the SL biosynthesis pathway. Consistent with the plastid localization of OsD27, we also show that AtD27 possesses a functional plastid transit peptide. We demonstrate that AtD27 transcripts are subject to both local feedback and auxin-dependent signals, albeit to a lesser extent than MAX3 and MAX4, suggesting that early steps in SL biosynthesis are coregulated at the transcriptional level. By identifying an additional component of the canonical SL biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis, we provide a new tool to investigate the regulation of shoot branching and other SL-dependent developmental processes.
22583826	Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Gene	OsSYP71 is an oxidative stress and rice blast response gene that encodes a Qc-SNARE protein in rice. Qc-SNARE proteins belong to the superfamily of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), which function as important components of the vesicle trafficking machinery in eukaryotic cells. In this paper, 12 Qc-SNARE genes were isolated from rice, and expression patterns of 9 genes were detected in various tissues and in seedlings challenged with oxidative stresses and inoculated with rice blast. The expression of OsSYP71 was clearly up-regulated under these stresses. Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants. These results indicate that Qc-SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast.
22655071	Comparison of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of alkali-stressed rice plants.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Alkali stress is an important agricultural contaminant and has complex effects on plant metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alkali stress has different effects on the growth, ion balance, and nitrogen metabolism in old and young leaves of rice plants, and to compare functions of both organs in alkali tolerance.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results showed that alkali stress only produced a small effect on the growth of young leaves, whereas strongly damaged old leaves. Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsAKT1, OsHAK1, OsHAK7, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 may contribute to the larger accumulation of Na(+) in old leaves under alkali stress. Alkali stress mightily reduced the NO(3)(-) contents in both organs. As old leaf cells have larger vacuole, under alkali stress these scarce NO(3)(-) was principally stored in old leaves. Accordingly, the expression of OsNRT1;1 and OsNRT1;2 in old leaves was up-regulated by alkali stress, revealing that the two genes might contribute to the accumulation of NO(3)(-) in old leaves. NO(3)(-) deficiency in young leaves under alkali stress might induce the reduction in OsNR1 expression and the subsequent lacking of NH(4)(+), which might be main reason for the larger down-regulation of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in young leaves.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly indicated that, during adaptation of rice to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of ion balance and nitrogen metabolism regulation. We propose that the comparative studies of young and old tissues may be important for abiotic stress tolerance research.
22642989	Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytokinins are involved in key developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa), including the regulation of cell proliferation and grain yield. However, the in vivo action of histidine kinases (OsHks), putative cytokinin receptors, in rice cytokinin signaling remains elusive. This study examined the function and characteristics of OsHk3, 4 and 6 in rice. OsHk6 was highly sensitive to isopentenyladenine (iP) and was capable of restoring cytokinin-dependent ARR6 reporter expression in the ahk2 ahk3 Arabidopsis mutant upon treatment with 1 nM iP. OsHk4 recognized trans-zeatin (tZ) and iP, while OsHk3 scarcely induced cytokinin signaling activity. OsHk4 and OsHk6 mediated the canonical two-component signaling cascade of Arabidopsis to induce phosphorylation of ARR2. OsHk4 and OsHk6 were highly expressed in spikelets, suggesting that tZ and iP might play key roles in grain development. OsHk6 formed a self-interacting homomer in rice protoplasts, although the trans-phosphorylation activity between subunits was much lower than the intra-molecular trans-phosphorylation activity. This indicates that the action mechanism of OsHks is evolutionarily diverged from bacterial histidine kinases. Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor. From the results of this study, OsHks are homomeric cytokinin receptors with distinctive cytokinin preferences in rice.
22519706	The rice hydroperoxide lyase OsHPL3 functions in defense responses by modulating the oxylipin pathway.	2012	Plant J	As important signal molecules, jasmonates (JAs) and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) play diverse roles in plant defense responses against insect pests and pathogens. However, how plants employ their specific defense responses by modulating the levels of JA and GLVs remains unclear. Here, we describe identification of a role for the rice HPL3 gene, which encodes a hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), OsHPL3/CYP74B2, in mediating plant-specific defense responses. The loss-of-function mutant hpl3-1 produced disease-resembling lesions spreading through the whole leaves. A biochemical assay revealed that OsHPL3 possesses intrinsic HPL activity, hydrolyzing hydroperoxylinolenic acid to produce GLVs. The hpl3-1 plants exhibited enhanced induction of JA, trypsin proteinase inhibitors and other volatiles, but decreased levels of GLVs including (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. OsHPL3 positively modulates resistance to the rice brown planthopper [BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)] but negatively modulates resistance to the rice striped stem borer [SSB, Chilo suppressalis (Walker)]. Moreover, hpl3-1 plants were more attractive to a BPH egg parasitoid, Anagrus nilaparvatae, than the wild-type, most likely as a result of increased release of BPH-induced volatiles. Interestingly, hpl3-1 plants also showed increased resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). Collectively, these results indicate that OsHPL3, by affecting the levels of JA, GLVs and other volatiles, modulates rice-specific defense responses against different invaders.
22531935	Influence of different nitrogen inputs on the members of ammonium transporter and glutamine synthetase genes in two rice genotypes having differential responsiveness to nitrogen.	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Two aromatic rice genotypes, Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) and Kalanamak 3119 (KN3119) having 120 and 30 kg/ha optimum nitrogen requirement respectively, to produce optimal yield, were chosen to understand their differential nitrogen responsiveness. Both the genotypes grown under increasing nitrogen inputs showed differences in seed/panicle, 1,000 seed weight, %nitrogen in the biomass and protein content in the seeds. All these parameters in PB1 were found to be in the increasing order in contrast to KN3119 which showed declined response on increasing nitrogen dose exceeding the normal dose indicating that both the genotypes respond differentially to the nitrogen inputs. Gene expression analysis of members of ammonium transporter gene family in flag leaves during active grain filling stage revealed that all the three members of OsAMT3 family genes (OsAMT1;1-3), only one member of OsAMT2 family i.e., OsAMT2;3 and the high affinity OsAMT1;1 were differentially expressed and were affected by different doses of nitrogen. In both the genotypes, both increase and decline in seed protein contents matched with the expressions levels of OsAMT1;1, OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2 in the flag leaves during grain filling stage indicating that high nitrogen nutrition in KN3119 probably causes the repression of these genes which might be important during grain filling.
22581231	Parallel domestication of the Shattering1 genes in cereals.	2012	Nat Genet	A key step during crop domestication is the loss of seed shattering. Here, we show that seed shattering in sorghum is controlled by a single gene, Shattering1 (Sh1), which encodes a YABBY transcription factor. Domesticated sorghums harbor three different mutations at the Sh1 locus. Variants at regulatory sites in the promoter and intronic regions lead to a low level of expression, a 2.2-kb deletion causes a truncated transcript that lacks exons 2 and 3, and a GT-to-GG splice-site variant in the intron 4 results in removal of the exon 4. The distributions of these non-shattering haplotypes among sorghum landraces suggest three independent origins. The function of the rice ortholog (OsSh1) was subsequently validated with a shattering-resistant mutant, and two maize orthologs (ZmSh1-1 and ZmSh1-5.1+ZmSh1-5.2) were verified with a large mapping population. Our results indicate that Sh1 genes for seed shattering were under parallel selection during sorghum, rice and maize domestication.
22794914	Basic leucine zipper transcription factor OsbZIP16 positively regulates drought resistance in rice.	2012	Plant Sci	Abiotic stress has been shown to limit the growth, development, and productivity of crops. Here, we characterized the function of a rice bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP16 in drought stress. Expression of OsbZIP16 was dramatically induced under drought conditions. Transient expression and transactivation assays demonstrated that OsbZIP16 was localized in the nucleus and had transactivation activity. At both the seedling and tillering stages, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP16 exhibited significantly improved drought resistance, which was positively correlated with the observed expression levels of OsbZIP16. Representative downstream drought-inducible genes were observed to have significantly higher expression levels in transgenic rice plants than in the wild type plants under drought conditions. OsbZIP16 was shown to be induced by exogenous ABA treatment, while overexpression of OsbZIP16 was observed to make transgenic plants more sensitive to ABA than wild type plants were. Transcriptome analysis identified a number of differentially expressed genes between wild type plants and plants overexpressing OsbZIP16, many of which are involved in stress response according to their gene ontologies. Overall, our findings suggest that OsbZIP16 positively regulates drought resistance in rice.
22572927	Overexpression of a phytochrome-regulated tandem zinc finger protein gene, OsTZF1, confers hypersensitivity to ABA and hyposensitivity to red light and far-red light in rice seedlings.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	UNLABELLED: Tandem zinc finger proteins (TZFs) in plants are involved in gene regulation, developmental responses, and hormone-mediated environmental responses in Arabidopsis. However, little information about the functions of the TZF family in monocots has been reported. Here, we investigated a cytoplasmic TZF protein, OsTZF1, which is involved in photomorphogenesis and ABA responses in rice seedlings. The OsTZF1 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves and shoots, although its transcripts were detected in various organs. Red light (R)- and far-red light (FR)-mediated repression of OsTZF1 gene expression was attributed to phytochrome B (phyB) and phytochrome C (phyC), respectively. In addition, OsTZF1 expression was regulated by salt, PEG, and ABA. Overexpression of OsTZF1 caused a long leaf sheath relative to wild type (WT) under R and FR, suggesting that OsTZF1 probably acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings. Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was marked in the OsTZF1-overexpression lines compared with WT, suggesting the positive regulation of OsTZF1 to ABA responses. Genome-wide expression analysis further revealed that OsTZF1 also functions in other hormone or stress responses. Our findings supply new evidence on the functions of monocot TZF proteins in phytochrome-mediated light and hormone responses.

KEY MESSAGE: OsTZF1 encodes a cytoplasm-localized tandem zinc finger protein and is regulated by both ABA and phytochrome-mediated light signaling. OsTZF1 functions in phytochrome-mediated light and ABA responses in rice.
22582989	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA.	2012	Physiol Plant	The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content of developing grains of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica was measured by combined liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. The increase from 50 ng g(-1) fresh weight to 2.9 µg g(-1) fresh weight from 1 to 14 days after pollination was much larger than that previously reported by enzyme-linked immunoassay methods. The largest increase in IAA content coincided with the start of the major starch deposition phase of grain-fill. The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These results confirm the importance of the tryptophan aminotransferase/YUCCA pathway in this system. All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of OsYUC11 appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsYUC11 and AtYUC10 belong to a separate clade of YUCCAs, which do not have orthologues outside the Angiosperms. This clade may have evolved with a specific role in endosperm. Expression of tryptophan decarboxylase in developing rice grains did not correlate with IAA levels, indicating that tryptamine is unlikely to be important for IAA synthesis in this system. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development.
22643902	SNP identification and allelic-specific PCR markers development for TaGW2, a gene linked to wheat kernel weight.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	TaGW2, an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2, has been associated with kernel width and weight of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Difference in TaGW2 coding sequence was not found among different wheat varieties in previous researches. In this study, we found eight exons and seven introns in TaGW2 with a full-length cDNA sequence of 1,275 bp, which contains a conserved function domain and seven splice sites that shared homology with rice OsGW2. A single T-base insertion in the eighth exon of TaGW2 on chromosome 6A was detected in a large-kernel wheat variety, Lankaodali. This insertion mutation reduces the coding protein sequence from normal 424 amino acids (~47.2 kDa) to 328 amino acids (~37.1 kDa) by truncating 96 amino acids. The result was validated by identifying histidine-tagged TaGW2 proteins encoded by both alleles of the mutant and the wild types in SDS-PAGE. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed based on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. The SNP markers were genotyped for an F(2) segregation population from the cross of Lankaodali × Chinese Spring. Seed traits of F(2:3) families were evaluated in three different environments. The association analysis indicated that F(2:3) families with the mutated TaGW2 allele significantly increased kernel width (KW) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and slightly improved kernel length (KL). Using the SNP markers, another two varieties harbored the mutated TaGW2 allele were successfully identified from 22 additional wheat varieties, and they both have large KW and TKW. Cloning and sequencing of the gene further confirmed the functions of the mutated allele of TaGW2 in the two large kernel varieties. The results suggested that TaGW2 may negatively regulate kernel size variation, which shares the same function as OsGW2 in rice. The successful development of SNP markers provides a useful tool for improving kernel yield in wheat.
22529386	Plant hormone jasmonate prioritizes defense over growth by interfering with gibberellin signaling cascade.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plants must effectively defend against biotic and abiotic stresses to survive in nature. However, this defense is costly and is often accompanied by significant growth inhibition. How plants coordinate the fluctuating growth-defense dynamics is not well understood and remains a fundamental question. Jasmonate (JA) and gibberellic acid (GA) are important plant hormones that mediate defense and growth, respectively. Binding of bioactive JA or GA ligands to cognate receptors leads to proteasome-dependent degradation of specific transcriptional repressors (the JAZ or DELLA family of proteins), which, at the resting state, represses cognate transcription factors involved in defense (e.g., MYCs) or growth [e.g. phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs)]. In this study, we found that the coi1 JA receptor mutants of rice (a domesticated monocot crop) and Arabidopsis (a model dicot plant) both exhibit hallmark phenotypes of GA-hypersensitive mutants. JA delays GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation, and the della mutant is less sensitive to JA for growth inhibition. Overexpression of a selected group of JAZ repressors in Arabidopsis plants partially phenocopies GA-associated phenotypes of the coi1 mutant, and JAZ9 inhibits RGA (a DELLA protein) interaction with transcription factor PIF3. Importantly, the pif quadruple (pifq) mutant no longer responds to JA-induced growth inhibition, and overexpression of PIF3 could partially overcome JA-induced growth inhibition. Thus, a molecular cascade involving the COI1-JAZ-DELLA-PIF signaling module, by which angiosperm plants prioritize JA-mediated defense over growth, has been elucidated.
22608525	OsIAA13-mediated auxin signaling is involved in lateral root initiation in rice.	2012	Plant Sci	The plant hormone auxin is essential for root formation. After auxin perception, transmission of the auxin signal progresses through the degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. In this study, we newly isolated and characterized a rice gain-of-function mutant, Osiaa13, containing a single amino acid substitution in the core sequence required for the degradation of the OsIAA13 protein. The Osiaa13 mutant displayed typical auxin-related phenotypes: the number of lateral roots was significantly reduced and the root gravitropic response was defective. Osiaa13 mutants also exhibited altered GUS staining controlled by the DR5 promoter in lateral root initiation sites. Furthermore, expression levels of several genes that might be associated with lateral root initiation were altered in Osiaa13. Taken together, our results indicate that OsIAA13 is involved in auxin signaling and controls the expression of genes that are required for lateral root initiation in rice.
22592958	RNA silencing suppressor Pns11 of rice gall dwarf virus induces virus-like symptoms in transgenic rice.	2012	Arch Virol	Transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants expressing the Pns11 protein of rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) displayed multiple abnormal phenotypes, some of which were highly reminiscent of the symptoms observed in RGDV-infected rice. Further analysis indicated that the apparent alterations in plant growth and morphology were correlated with the expression levels of microRNA160, microRNA162, microRNA167, microRNA168, and the microRNA target OsARF8. Especially, the striking dwarfing phenotype depended on the high expression level of microRNA167. By analogy to other categories of plant viruses, the RNA silencing suppressors encoded by plant dsRNA viruses function as pathogenicity determinants. These findings significantly deepen our current mechanistic understanding of the RNA silencing suppressor (VSR) encoded by a dsRNA virus and provide additional evidence that interference with microRNA expression is a VSR function utilized by a diverse range of viruses.
22569963	Rice choline monooxygenase (OsCMO) protein functions in enhancing glycine betaine biosynthesis in transgenic tobacco but does not accumulate in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica).	2012	Plant Cell Rep	UNLABELLED: Glycine betaine (GB) is a compatible quaternary amine that enables plants to tolerate abiotic stresses, including salt, drought and cold. In plants, GB is synthesized through two-step of successive oxidations from choline, catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), respectively. Rice is considered as a typical non-GB accumulating species, although the entire genome sequencing revealed rice contains orthologs of both CMO and BADH. Several studies unraveled that rice has a functional BADH gene, but whether rice CMO gene (OsCMO) is functional or a pseudogene remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report the functional characterization of rice CMO gene. The OsCMO gene was isolated from rice cv. Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) using RT-PCR. Northern blot demonstrated the transcription of OsCMO is enhanced by salt stress. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCMO results in increased GB content and elevated tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrates that a functional OsCMO protein with correct size was present in transgenic tobacco but rarely accumulated in wild-type rice plants. Surprisingly, a large amount of truncated proteins derived from OsCMO was induced in the rice seedlings in response to salt stresses. This suggests that it is the lack of a functional OsCMO protein that presumably results in non-GB accumulation in the tested rice plant.

KEY MESSAGE: Expression and transgenic studies demonstrate OsCMO is transcriptionally induced in response to salt stress and functions in increasing glycinebetaine accumulation and enhancing tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis suggests that no accumulation of glycinebetaine in the Japonica rice plant presumably results from lack of a functional OsCMO protein.
22731699	Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice.	2012	Plant J	The plant vacuole is an important organelle for storing excess iron (Fe), though its contribution to increasing the Fe content in staple foods remains largely unexplored. In this study we report the isolation and functional characterization of two rice genes OsVIT1 and OsVIT2, orthologs of the Arabidopsis VIT1. Transient expression of OsVIT1:EGFP and OsVIT2:EGFP protein fusions revealed that OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are localized to the vacuolar membrane. Ectopic expression of OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 partially rescued the Fe(2+) - and Zn(2+) -sensitive phenotypes in yeast mutant Δccc1 and Δzrc1, and further increased vacuolar Fe(2+) , Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) accumulation. These data together suggest that OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 function to transport Fe(2+) , Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) across the tonoplast into vacuoles in yeast. In rice, OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 are highly expressed in flag leaf blade and sheath, respectively, and in contrast to OsVIT1, OsVIT2 is highly responsive to Fe treatments. Interestingly, functional disruption of OsVIT1 and OsVIT2 leads to increased Fe/Zn accumulation in rice seeds and a corresponding decrease in the source organ flag leaves, indicating an enhanced Fe/Zn translocation between source and sink organs, which might represent a novel strategy to biofortify Fe/Zn in staple foods.
22694163	OsNPR1 negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice.	2013	Physiol Plant	NPR1 (a non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes1) has been reported to play an important role in plant defense by regulating signaling pathways. However, little to nothing is known about its function in herbivore-induced defense in monocot plants. Here, using suppressive substrate hybridization, we identified a NPR1 gene from rice, OsNPR1, and found that its expression levels were upregulated in response to infestation by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and to mechanical wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Moreover, mechanical wounding induced the expression of OsNPR1 quickly, whereas herbivore infestation induced the gene more slowly. The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2. The enhanced JA and ET signaling in as-npr1 plants increased the levels of herbivore-induced trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPIs) and volatiles, and reduced the performance of SSB. Our results suggest that OsNPR1 is an early responding gene in herbivore-induced defense and that plants can use it to activate a specific and appropriate defense response against invaders by modulating signaling pathways.
22745421	The development of C₄rice: current progress and future challenges.	2012	Science	Another "green revolution" is needed for crop yields to meet demands for food. The international C(4) Rice Consortium is working toward introducing a higher-capacity photosynthetic mechanism--the C(4) pathway--into rice to increase yield. The goal is to identify the genes necessary to install C(4) photosynthesis in rice through different approaches, including genomic and transcriptional sequence comparisons and mutant screening.
22717673	Over-expression of rice leucine-rich repeat protein results in activation of defense response, thereby enhancing resistance to bacterial soft rot in Chinese cabbage.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum causes soft rot disease in various plants, including Chinese cabbage. The simple extracellular leucine-rich repeat (eLRR) domain proteins have been implicated in disease resistance. Rice leucine-rich repeat protein (OsLRP), a rice simple eLRR domain protein, is induced by pathogens, phytohormones, and salt. To see whether OsLRP enhances disease resistance to bacterial soft rot, OsLRP was introduced into Chinese cabbage by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Two independent transgenic lines over-expressing OsLRP were generated and further analyzed. Transgenic lines over-expressing OsLRP showed enhanced disease resistance to bacterial soft rot compared to non-transgenic control. Bacterial growth was retarded in transgenic lines over-expressing OsLRP compared to non-transgenic controls. We propose that OsLRP confers enhanced resistance to bacterial soft rot. Monitoring expression of defense-associated genes in transgenic lines over-expressing OsLRP, two different glucanases and Brassica rapa polygalacturonase inhibiting protein 2, PDF1 were constitutively activated in transgenic lines compared to non-transgenic control. Taken together, heterologous expression of OsLRP results in the activation of defense response and enhanced resistance to bacterial soft rot.
22665444	Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Plant chitinases, a class of glycosyl hydrolases, participate in various aspects of normal plant growth and development, including cell wall metabolism and disease resistance. The rice (Oryza sativa) genome encodes 37 putative chitinases and chitinase-like proteins. However, none of them has been characterized at the genetic level. In this study, we report the isolation of a brittle culm mutant, bc15, and the map-based cloning of the BC15/OsCTL1 (for chitinase-like1) gene affected in the mutant. The gene encodes the rice chitinase-like protein BC15/OsCTL1. Mutation of BC15/OsCTL1 causes reduced cellulose content and mechanical strength without obvious alterations in plant growth. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that BC15/OsCTL1 is a class II chitinase-like protein that is devoid of both an amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain and the chitinase activity motif H-E-T-T but possesses an amino-terminal transmembrane domain. Biochemical assays demonstrated that BC15/OsCTL1 is a Golgi-localized type II membrane protein that lacks classical chitinase activity. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and β-glucuronidase activity analyses indicated that BC15/OsCTL1 is ubiquitously expressed. Investigation of the global expression profile of wild-type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling. Our findings provide genetic evidence of a role for plant chitinases in cellulose biosynthesis in rice, which appears to differ from their roles as revealed by analysis of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
22751314	Biliverdin-promoted lateral root formation is mediated through heme oxygenase in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	In this study, we examined the effect of biliverdin (BV), a product of heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzed reaction, on lateral root (LR) formation in rice. Treatment with BV induced LR formation and HO activity. As well, BV, could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zn protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) reduced LR number, HO activity and OsHO1 mRNA level induced by BV. Our data suggest that HO is required for BV-induced LR formation in rice.
22723425	Septin-mediated plant cell invasion by the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	Science	To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae develops a pressurized dome-shaped cell called an appressorium, which physically ruptures the leaf cuticle to gain entry to plant tissue. Here, we report that a toroidal F-actin network assembles in the appressorium by means of four septin guanosine triphosphatases, which polymerize into a dynamic, hetero-oligomeric ring. Septins scaffold F-actin, via the ezrin-radixin-moesin protein Tea1, and phosphatidylinositide interactions at the appressorium plasma membrane. The septin ring assembles in a Cdc42- and Chm1-dependent manner and forms a diffusion barrier to localize the inverse-bin-amphiphysin-RVS-domain protein Rvs167 and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein Las17 at the point of penetration. Septins thereby provide the cortical rigidity and membrane curvature necessary for protrusion of a rigid penetration peg to breach the leaf surface.
22686276	Modulation of genes related to specific metabolic pathways in response to cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase knockdown in rice plants.	2012	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	As a central component of the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying system in plant cells, ascorbate peroxidases (APX) play an essential role in the control of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. To characterise the function of cytosolic APX isoforms (OsAPX1 and OsAPX2) in the mechanisms of plant defence, OsAPX1/2 knockdown rice plants were previously obtained. OsAPX1/2 knockdown plants (APx1/2s) exhibited a normal phenotype and development, even though they showed a global reduction of APX activity and increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation. To understand how rice plants compensate for the deficiency of cytosolic APX, expression and proteomic analyses were performed to characterise the global expression pattern of the APx1/2s mutant line compared with non-transformed plants. Our results strongly suggest that deficiencies in cytosolic APX isoforms markedly alter expression of genes associated with several key metabolic pathways, especially of genes involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant defence. These metabolic changes are compensatory because central physiological processes such as photosynthesis and growth were similar to non-transformed rice plants. Our analyses showed modulation of groups of genes and proteins related to specific metabolic pathways. Among the differentially expressed genes, the largest number corresponded to those with catalytic activity. Genes related to oxidative stress, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis and transcription factor-encoding genes were also modulated. These results represent an important step toward understanding of the role played by cytosolic APX isoforms and hydrogen peroxide in the regulation of metabolism by redox modulation in monocots.
22735448	Cleavage and nuclear localization of the rice XA21 immune receptor.	2012	Nat Commun	Plants and animals carry specific receptors that recognize invading pathogens and respond by activating an immune response. The rice XA21 receptor confers broad-spectrum immunity to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae upon recognition of a small protein, Ax21, that is conserved in all Xanthomonas species and related genera. Here we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved to release the intracellular kinase domain and that this intracellular domain carries a functional nuclear localization sequence. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicate that the XA21 intracellular domain interacts with the OsWRKY62 transcriptional regulator exclusively in the nucleus of rice protoplasts. In vivo cleavage of XA21 and translocalization of the intracellular kinase domain to the nucleus is required for the XA21-mediated immune response. These results suggest a new model for immune receptor function: on receptor recognition of conserved microbial signatures, the associated kinase translocates to the nucleus where it directly interacts with transcriptional regulators.
22729225	Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice.	2012	Nat Genet	Grain size and shape are important components of grain yield and quality and have been under selection since cereals were first domesticated. Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus GW8 is synonymous with OsSPL16, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of cell proliferation. Higher expression of this gene promotes cell division and grain filling, with positive consequences for grain width and yield in rice. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in Basmati rice is associated with the formation of a more slender grain and better quality of appearance. The correlation between grain size and allelic variation at the GW8 locus suggests that mutations within the promoter region were likely selected in rice breeding programs. We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield.
22705026	Molecular characterization and concerted evolution of two genes encoding RING-C2 type proteins in rice.	2012	Gene	RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger proteins are believed to play a critical role in mediating the transfer of ubiquitin to heterogeneous substrate(s). While the two canonical types, RING-H2 and RING-HC, have been well-characterized, the molecular functions of the modified types, particularly the RING-C2 types, remain elusive. We isolated two rice genes harboring the RING-C2 domain on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12, termed OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2, respectively. A comparison of sequence divergences between 10 duplicate pairs on the distal parts of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and randomly selected duplicate pairs suggested that OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2 have evolved in concert via gene conversion. An in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that both proteins possess E3 ligase activity, suggesting that the innate functions of these RING domains have not been affected by their modifications during evolution. Subcellular localizations were strikingly different; OsRINGC2-1 was found only in the cytoplasm with many punctate complexes, whereas OsRINGC2-2 was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The expression patterns of both genes showed striking differences in response to salt stress, whereas plants heterogeneous for both genes mediated salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, supporting the notion of concerted evolution. These results shed light on the molecular functions of OsRINGC2-1 and OsRINGC2-2 and provide insight into their molecular evolution.
22688271	Rapid generation of rice mutants via the dominant negative suppression of the mismatch repair protein OsPMS1.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Mismatch repair (MMR) is a conservative pathway for maintaining the genome integrity of different organisms. Although suppression of MMR has resulted in various mutation phenotypes in Arabidopsis, the use of this strategy for mutation breeding in major crops has not been reported. Here, we overexpressed a truncated version of the OsPMS1 protein in rice; this approach is expected to suppress the rice MMR system through a dominant negative mechanism. We observed a wide spectrum of mutation phenotypes in the progeny of the transgenic plants during seed germination and the plant growth stages. Genomic variations were detected with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and sequencing of the differential ISSR bands revealed that the mutation occurred as a point mutation or as microsatellite instability at high frequencies. Plant lines with agronomically important traits, such as salt and drought tolerance, various tiller number, and early flowering, were obtained. Furthermore, we obtained mutants with important traits that are free of the transgene. Together, these results demonstrate that MMR suppression can be used as an efficient strategy for mutation breeding in rice.
22688121	Biochemical and molecular analyses of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from a C4 plant Pennisetum glaucum reveals an adaptive role in response to oxidative stress.	2012	Gene	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) form the foremost line of defense against ROS in aerobes. Pennisetum glaucum cDNA library is constructed to isolate superoxide dismutase cDNA clone (PgCuZnSOD) of 798 bp comprising 5'UTR (111 bp), an ORF (459 bp) and 3'UTR (228 bp). Deduced protein of 152 amino acids (16.7 kDa) with an estimated isoelectric point of 5.76 shared highest homology to cytoplasmic CuZnSODs from monocots i.e., maize, rice. Predicted 3D model reveals a conserved eight-stranded ß-barrel with active site held between barrel and two surface loops. Purified recombinant protein is relatively thermo-stable with maximal activity at pH 7.6 and shows inhibition with H(2)O(2) (4.3 mM) but not with azide (10 mM). In Pennisetum seedlings, abiotic stress induced PgCuZnSOD transcript up-regulation directly correlates to high protein and activity induction. Overexpression of PgCuZnSOD confers comparatively enhanced tolerance to methyl viologen (MV) induced oxidative stress in bacteria. Results imply that PgCuZnSOD plays a functional role in conferring oxidative stress tolerance to prokaryotic system and may hold significant potential to impart oxidative stress tolerance in higher plants through transgenic approach.
22849582	Identification of two stably expressed QTLs for fat content in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Genome	Fat content (FC) is an important component of the nutritional quality of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain and a partial determinant of grain quality. Three FC QTLs were identified from an analysis of a set of rice 'Kasalath'/'Koshihikari' backcross inbred lines, which were grown in three independent environments. Two of these QTLs (qFC7.1 and qFC7.2) were located on chromosome 7, and they were detected in all three environments. The presence of qFC7.1 and qFC7.2 was further confirmed by testing a set of 'Kasalath' (donor) / 'Koshihikari' (recipient) chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) across six environments. Both QTLs significantly increased grain FC and they might be involved in lipid metabolism. The two QTLs were stably expressed in a number of environments and populations, making them suitable candidates for the improvement of FC via marker assisted breeding.
22803610	Functional characterization of the rice SPX-MFS family reveals a key role of OsSPX-MFS1 in controlling phosphate homeostasis in leaves.	2012	New Phytol	• Proteins possessing the SPX domain are found in several proteins involved in inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and signalling in yeast and plants. Although the functions of several SPX-domain protein subfamilies have recently been uncovered, the role of the SPX-MFS subfamily is still unclear. • Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we studied the regulation of SPX-MFS gene expression by the central regulator, OsPHR2 and Pi starvation. The function of OsSPX-MFS1 in Pi homeostasis was analysed using an OsSPX-MFS1 mutant (mfs1) and osa-miR827 overexpression line (miR827-Oe). Finally, heterologous complementation of a yeast mutant impaired in Pi transporter was used to assess the capacity of OsSPX-MFS1 to transport Pi. • Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX-MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX-MFS2 was induced. Mutation in OsSPX-MFS1 (mfs1) and overexpression of the upstream miR827 (miR827-Oe) plants impaired Pi homeostasis in the leaves. In addition, studies in yeast revealed that OsSPX-MFS1 may be involved in Pi transport. • The results suggest that OsSPX-MFS1 is a key player in maintaining Pi homeostasis in the leaves, potentially acting as a Pi transporter.
22856514	Genome-wide identification, evolutionary and expression analyses of putative Fe-S biogenesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Genome	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are ubiquitous in nature and carry Fe-S clusters (ISCs) as prosthetic groups that are essential in maintaining basic biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and DNA repair. In the present investigation, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out to find all the genes involved in the formation of ISCs in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) through a systematic EST and genomic DNA sequence data mining. This analysis profiled 44 rice ISC genes (OsISCs) that were identified using in silico analysis. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were highly conserved among bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that all OsISCs were active and that the transcript abundance of some OsISCs was tissue specific. The results of this study will assist further investigations to identify and elucidate the structural components involved in the assembly, biogenesis, and regulation of OsISCs. Thus, the outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the OsISC and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsISCs in plant growth and development in the future. Also, it may enable us in the future to enhance the crop yield, uptake of Fe, and protection against abiotic and biotic stress.
22773748	Convergent starvation signals and hormone crosstalk in regulating nutrient mobilization upon germination in cereals.	2012	Plant Cell	Germination is a unique developmental transition from metabolically quiescent seed to actively growing seedling that requires an ensemble of hydrolases for coordinated nutrient mobilization to support heterotrophic growth until autotrophic photosynthesis is established. This study reveals two crucial transcription factors, MYBS1 and MYBGA, present in rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), that function to integrate diverse nutrient starvation and gibberellin (GA) signaling pathways during germination of cereal grains. Sugar represses but sugar starvation induces MYBS1 synthesis and its nuclear translocation. GA antagonizes sugar repression by enhancing conuclear transport of the GA-inducible MYBGA with MYBS1 and the formation of a stable bipartite MYB-DNA complex to activate the α-amylase gene. We further discovered that not only sugar but also nitrogen and phosphate starvation signals converge and interconnect with GA to promote the conuclear import of MYBS1 and MYBGA, resulting in the expression of a large set of GA-inducible but functionally distinct hydrolases, transporters, and regulators associated with mobilization of the full complement of nutrients to support active seedling growth in cereals.
22785493	Overexpression of OsRab7B3, a small GTP-binding protein gene, enhances leaf senescence in transgenic rice.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Rab family proteins are small GTP-binding proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. They play critical roles in several plant development processes. Different expression patterns of 46 Rabs in the rice genome were examined in various rice tissues and in leaves treated with plant growth regulators and under senescence conditions. One of the OsRab genes, OsRab7B3, closely associated with senescence in expression pattern, was chosen for functional analysis. Expression of sGFP under the control of the OsRab7B3 promoter increased in leaves when ABA and NaCl were applied or when kept in dark. In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions. Moreover, leaf yellowing occurred earlier in the transgenic plants than in the wild type at the ripening stage. Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process.
22859682	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	F-box proteins play diverse roles in regulating numerous physiological processes in plants. This study isolated a gene (OsFbx352) from rice encoding an F-box domain protein and characterized its role in seed germination. Expression of OsFbx352 was upregulated by abscisic acid (ABA). The transcripts of OsFbx352 were increased upon imbibition of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by glucose. Germination of seeds with overexpression of OsFbx352 was less suppressed by glucose than that of wild-type seeds, while glucose had greater inhibition for germination of seeds with knockdown of OsFbx352 by RNA interference (RNAi) than that of wild-type seeds. The differential response of germination of the transgenic and wild-type seeds to glucose may be accounted for by differences in ABA content among overexpressing, RNAi, and wild-type seeds such that overexpression of OsFbx352 and knockdown of OsFbx352 led to lower and higher ABA contents, respectively, than that of wild-type seeds in the presence of glucose. Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose. These findings indicate that OsFbx352 plays a regulatory role in the regulation of glucose-induced suppression of seed germination by targeting ABA metabolism.
22805094	Overexpression of OsPAP10a, a root-associated acid phosphatase, increased extracellular organic phosphorus utilization in rice.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major limitation for plant growth and development. Among the wide set of responses to cope with low soil P, plants increase their level of intracellular and secreted acid phosphatases (APases), which helps to catalyze inorganic phosphate (Pi) hydrolysis from organo-phosphates. In this study we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) purple acid phosphatase 10a (OsPAP10a). OsPAP10a belongs to group Ia of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), and clusters with the principal secreted PAPs in a variety of plant species including Arabidopsis. The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis. In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation. Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts. In vivo root 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) assays and activity measurements on external media showed that OsPAP10a is a root-associated APase. Furthermore, overexpression of OsPAP10a significantly improved ATP hydrolysis and utilization compared with wild type plants. These results indicate that OsPAP10a can potentially be used for crop breeding to improve the efficiency of P use.
22790320	Development of multiple embryos in polyembryonic insertional mutant OsPE of rice.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsPE of rice gives twin and triplet seedlings in up to 20 % of the seeds. Detailed cytological and histological analysis of OsPE indicated normal male and female gametogenesis in the OsPE mutant. Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) analysis of the developing seeds of OsPE showed multiple embryo development in up to 60 % of the ovules. The multiple embryos, mostly twins and triplets, and rarely quadruplets, developed through sequential cleavage from a single zygotic embryo in each ovule. The reduced number of multiple seedlings compared with multiple embryos observed in CLSM study may be attributed to their inability to develop further due to competition in a single embryo sac. Key message Multiple seedlings in the OsPE mutant are due to sequential proliferation and cleavage of the zygotic embryos. The nucellar tissue was not involved in multiple embryo development.
22786887	Rice mitogen-activated protein kinase interactome analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system.	2012	Plant Physiol	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades support the flow of extracellular signals to intracellular target molecules and ultimately drive a diverse array of physiological functions in cells, tissues, and organisms by interacting with other proteins. Yet, our knowledge of the global physical MAPK interactome in plants remains largely fragmented. Here, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, subcellular localization, and kinase assay experiments in the model crop rice (Oryza sativa) to systematically map what is to our knowledge the first plant MAPK-interacting proteins. We identified 80 nonredundant interacting protein pairs (74 nonredundant interactors) for rice MAPKs and elucidated the novel proteome-wide network of MAPK interactors. The established interactome contains four membrane-associated proteins, seven MAP2Ks (for MAPK kinase), four MAPKs, and 59 putative substrates, including 18 transcription factors. Several interactors were also validated by experimental approaches (in vivo and in vitro) and literature survey. Our results highlight the importance of OsMPK1, an ortholog of tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) salicyclic acid-induced protein kinase and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtMPK6, among the rice MAPKs, as it alone interacts with 41 unique proteins (51.2% of the mapped MAPK interaction network). Additionally, Gene Ontology classification of interacting proteins into 34 functional categories suggested MAPK participation in diverse physiological functions. Together, the results obtained essentially enhance our knowledge of the MAPK-interacting protein network and provide a valuable research resource for developing a nearly complete map of the rice MAPK interactome.
22780875	Clustered metallothionein genes are co-regulated in rice and ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P confers multiple abiotic stress tolerance in tobacco via ROS scavenging.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Metallothioneins (MT) are low molecular weight, cysteine rich metal binding proteins, found across genera and species, but their function(s) in abiotic stress tolerance are not well documented.

RESULTS: We have characterized a rice MT gene, OsMT1e-P, isolated from a subtractive library generated from a stressed salinity tolerant rice genotype, Pokkali. Bioinformatics analysis of the rice genome sequence revealed that this gene belongs to a multigenic family, which consists of 13 genes with 15 protein products. OsMT1e-P is located on chromosome XI, away from the majority of other type I genes that are clustered on chromosome XII. Various members of this MT gene cluster showed a tight co-regulation pattern under several abiotic stresses. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of conserved cysteine residues in OsMT1e-P protein. Salinity stress was found to regulate the transcript abundance of OsMT1e-P in a developmental and organ specific manner. Using transgenic approach, we found a positive correlation between ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P and stress tolerance. Our experiments further suggest ROS scavenging to be the possible mechanism for multiple stress tolerance conferred by OsMT1e-P.

CONCLUSION: We present an overview of MTs, describing their gene structure, genome localization and expression patterns under salinity and development in rice. We have found that ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P enhances tolerance towards multiple abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco and the resultant plants could survive and set viable seeds under saline conditions. Taken together, the experiments presented here have indicated that ectopic expression of OsMT1e-P protects against oxidative stress primarily through efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species.
22534193	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies.	2012	Biochimie	Fragrance rice (Oryza sativa) contains two isoforms of BADH, named OsBADH1 and OsBADH2. OsBADH1 is implicated in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes, while the non-functional OsBADH2 is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the major compound of aroma in fragrance rice. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were used to investigate the substrate specificity towards Bet-ald and GAB-ald. Consistent with our previous study, kinetics data indicated that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of GAB-ald more efficiently than Bet-ald and the OsBADH1 W172F and OsBADH2 W170F mutants displayed a higher catalytic efficiency towards GAB-ald. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations for the first time provided models for aldehyde substrate-bound complexes of OsBADHs. The amino acid residues, E262, L263, C296 and W461 of OsBADH1 and E260, L261, C294 and W459 of OsBADH2 located within 5 Å of the OsBADH active site mainly interacted with GAB-ald forming strong hydrogen bonds in both OsBADH isoforms. Residues W163, N164, Q294, C296 and F397 of OsBADH1-Bet-ald and Y163, M167, W170, E260, S295 and C453 of OsBADH2-Bet-ald formed the main interaction sites while E260 showed an interaction energy of -14.21 kcal/mol. Unconserved A290 in OsBADH1 and W288 in OsBADH2 appeared to be important for substrate recognition similar to that observed in PsAMADHs. Overall, the results here help to explain how two homologous rice BADHs recognize the aldehyde substrate differently, a key property to their biological role.
22807445	Identification of amino acids important for substrate specificity in sucrose transporters using gene shuffling.	2012	J Biol Chem	Plant sucrose transporters (SUTs) are H(+)-coupled uptake transporters. Type I and II (SUTs) are phylogenetically related but have different substrate specificities. Type I SUTs transport sucrose, maltose, and a wide range of natural and synthetic α- and β-glucosides. Type II SUTs are more selective for sucrose and maltose. Here, we investigated the structural basis for this difference in substrate specificity. We used a novel gene shuffling method called synthetic template shuffling to introduce 62 differentially conserved amino acid residues from type I SUTs into OsSUT1, a type II SUT from rice. The OsSUT1 variants were tested for their ability to transport the fluorescent coumarin β-glucoside esculin when expressed in yeast. Fluorescent yeast cells were selected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Substitution of five amino acids present in type I SUTs in OsSUT1 was found to be sufficient to confer esculin uptake activity. The changes clustered in two areas of the OsSUT1 protein: in the first loop and the top of TMS2 (T80L and A86K) and in TMS5 (S220A, S221A, and T224Y). The substrate specificity of this OsSUT1 variant was almost identical to that of type I SUTs. Corresponding changes in the sugarcane type II transporter ShSUT1 also changed substrate specificity, indicating that these residues contribute to substrate specificity in type II SUTs in general.
22793791	Multifunctionality and diversity of GDSL esterase/lipase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) genome: new insights from bioinformatics analysis.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: GDSL esterases/lipases are a newly discovered subclass of lipolytic enzymes that are very important and attractive research subjects because of their multifunctional properties, such as broad substrate specificity and regiospecificity. Compared with the current knowledge regarding these enzymes in bacteria, our understanding of the plant GDSL enzymes is very limited, although the GDSL gene family in plant species include numerous members in many fully sequenced plant genomes. Only two genes from a large rice GDSL esterase/lipase gene family were previously characterised, and the majority of the members remain unknown. In the present study, we describe the rice OsGELP (Oryza sativa GDSL esterase/lipase protein) gene family at the genomic and proteomic levels, and use this knowledge to provide insights into the multifunctionality of the rice OsGELP enzymes.

RESULTS: In this study, an extensive bioinformatics analysis identified 114 genes in the rice OsGELP gene family. A complete overview of this family in rice is presented, including the chromosome locations, gene structures, phylogeny, and protein motifs. Among the OsGELPs and the plant GDSL esterase/lipase proteins of known functions, 41 motifs were found that represent the core secondary structure elements or appear specifically in different phylogenetic subclades. The specification and distribution of identified putative conserved clade-common and -specific peptide motifs, and their location on the predicted protein three dimensional structure may possibly signify their functional roles. Potentially important regions for substrate specificity are highlighted, in accordance with protein three-dimensional model and location of the phylogenetic specific conserved motifs. The differential expression of some representative genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The phylogenetic analysis, together with protein motif architectures, and the expression profiling were analysed to predict the possible biological functions of the rice OsGELP genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Our current genomic analysis, for the first time, presents fundamental information on the organization of the rice OsGELP gene family. With combination of the genomic, phylogenetic, microarray expression, protein motif distribution, and protein structure analyses, we were able to create supported basis for the functional prediction of many members in the rice GDSL esterase/lipase family. The present study provides a platform for the selection of candidate genes for further detailed functional study.
22846038	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	New Phytol	• MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of auxin signaling components plays a critical role in plant development. miRNA expression and functional diversity contribute to the complexity of regulatory networks of miRNA/target modules. • This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1). • We found that the miR393 family members possess distinctive expression patterns, with miR393a expressed mainly in the crown and lateral root primordia, as well as the coleoptile tip, and miR393b expressed in the shoot apical meristem. Transgenic plants overexpressing miR393a/b displayed a severe phenotype with hallmarks of altered auxin signaling, mainly including enlarged flag leaf inclination and altered primary and crown root growth. Furthermore, OsAFB2- and OsTIR1-suppressed lines exhibited increased inclination of flag leaves at the booting stage, resembling miR393-overexpressing plants. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1. • Expression diversification of miRNA393 implies the potential role of miRNA regulation during species evolution. The conserved mechanisms of the miR393/target module indicate the fundamental importance of the miR393-mediated regulation of auxin signal transduction in rice.
22778444	Transcriptome and methylome interactions in rice hybrids.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark that controls gene expression, is responsive to environmental stresses, and, in plants, may also play a role in heterosis. To determine the degree to which DNA methylation is inherited in rice, and how it both influences and is affected by transcription, we performed genome-wide measurements of these patterns through an integrative analysis of bisulfite-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and siRNA-sequencing data in two inbred parents of the Nipponbare (NPB) and indica (93-11) varieties of rice and their hybrid offspring. We show that SNPs occur at a rate of about 1/253 bp between the two parents and that these are faithfully transmitted into the hybrids. We use the presence of these SNPs to reconstruct the two chromosomes in the hybrids according to their parental origin. We found that, unlike genetic inheritance, epigenetic heritability is quite variable. Cytosines were found to be differentially methylated (epimutated) at a rate of 7.48% (1/15 cytosines) between the NPB and 93-11 parental strains. We also observed that 0.79% of cytosines were epimutated between the parent and corresponding hybrid chromosome. We found that these epimutations are often clustered on the chromosomes, with clusters representing 20% of all epimutations between parental ecotypes, and 2-5% in F1 plants. Epimutation clusters are also strongly associated with regions where the production of siRNA differs between parents. Finally, we identified genes with both allele-specific expression patterns that were strongly inherited as well as those differentially expressed between hybrids and the corresponding parental chromosome. We conclude that much of the misinheritance of expression levels is likely caused by epimutations and trans effects.
22755510	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
21059694	Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice.	2011	Mol Plant	As one of the largest gene families, F-box domain proteins have important roles in regulating various developmental processes and stress responses. In this study, we have investigated a rice F-box domain gene, MAIF1. The MAIF1 protein is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus. MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses. MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth. These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth. Growth restraint in plants is an acclimatization strategy against abiotic stress. Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth.
21825104	The small GTPase Rab5a is essential for intracellular transport of proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole and endosomal membrane organization in developing rice endosperm.	2011	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) glutelins are synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum as larger precursors, which are then transported via the Golgi to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. Three independent glutelin precursor mutant4 (glup4) rice lines, which accumulated elevated levels of proglutelin over the wild type, were identified as loss-of-function mutants of Rab5a, the small GTPase involved in vesicular membrane transport. In addition to the plasma membrane, Rab5a colocalizes with glutelins on the Golgi apparatus, Golgi-derived dense vesicles, and the PSV, suggesting that Rab5a participates in the transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi to the PSV. This spatial distribution pattern was dramatically altered in the glup4 mutants. Numerous smaller protein bodies containing glutelin and α-globulin were evident, and the proteins were secreted extracellularly. Moreover, all three independent glup4 allelic lines displayed the novel appearance of a large dilated, structurally complex paramural body containing proglutelins, α-globulins, membrane biomarkers for the Golgi apparatus, prevacuolar compartment, PSV, and the endoplasmic reticulum luminal chaperones BiP and protein disulfide isomerase as well as β-glucan. These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function. Overall, Rab5a is required not only for the intracellular transport of proglutelins from the Golgi to the PSV in rice endosperm but also in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in developing rice seeds.
14657402	Functional analysis and intracellular localization of rice cryptochromes.	2003	Plant Physiol	Blue-light-receptor cryptochrome (CRY), which mediates cotyledon expansion, increased accumulation of anthocyanin, and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, was first identified in Arabidopsis. Two Arabidopsis cryptochromes (AtCRY1 and AtCRY2) have been reported to be localized to the nucleus. However, there is no information on the cryptochromes in monocotyledons. In this study, we isolated two cryptochrome cDNAs, OsCRY1 and OsCRY2, from rice (Oryza sativa) plants. The deduced amino acid sequences of OsCRY1 and OsCRY2 have a photolyase-like domain in their N termini and are homologous to AtCRY1. To investigate the function of OsCRY1, we overexpressed a green fluorescence protein-OsCRY1 fusion gene in Arabidopsis and assessed the phenotypes of the resulting transgenic plants. When the seedlings were germinated in the dark, no discernible effect was observed. However, light-germinated seedlings showed pronounced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and increased accumulation of anthocyanin. These phenotypes were induced in a blue-light-dependent manner, indicating that OsCRY1 functions as a blue-light-receptor cryptochrome. We also examined the intracellular localization of green fluorescence protein-OsCRY1 in the transgenic plants. It was localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We identified two nuclear localization domains in the primary structure of OsCRY1. We discuss the relationship between the function and intracellular localization of rice cryptochromes by using additional data obtained with OsCRY2.
19825552	OsWRKY62 is a negative regulator of basal and Xa21-mediated defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice.	2008	Mol Plant	The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), encodes a receptor-like kinase. Few components involved in transducing the Xa21-mediated defense response have yet been identified. Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62. The OsWRKY62 gene encodes two splice variants (OsWRKY62.1 and OsWRKY62.2). OsWRKY62.1:smGFP2 and OsWRKY62.2:smGFP2 fusion proteins partially localize to the nucleus. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsWRKY62.1 are compromised in basal defense and Xa21-mediated resistance to Xoo. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY62.1 suppresses the activation of defense-related genes. These results imply that OsWRKY62 functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity in rice, and serves as a critical mediator of both basal and race-specific defense responses.
20385831	An ATPase promotes autophosphorylation of the pattern recognition receptor XA21 and inhibits XA21-mediated immunity.	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are key components of the innate immune response in animals and plants. These receptors typically carry or associate with non-RD kinases to control early events of innate immunity signaling. Despite their importance, the mode of regulation of PRRs is largely unknown. Here we show that the rice PRR, XA21, interacts with XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), a previously undescribed ATPase. XB24 promotes autophosphorylation of XA21 through its ATPase activity. Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity. XB24 ATPase enzyme activity is required for XB24 function. XA21 is degraded in the presence of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Ax21 when XB24 is overexpressed. These results demonstrate a function for this large class of broadly conserved ATPases in PRR-mediated immunity.
20590657	Elucidation of XA21-mediated innate immunity.	2010	Cell Microbiol	In the early 1970s, the Xa21 gene from the wild rice species Oryza longistaminata drew attention of rice breeders because of its broad-spectrum resistance to diverse strains of a serious bacterial disease of rice in Asia and Africa, called 'bacterial blight disease', caused by the Gram-negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In 1995, we isolated the gene controlling this resistance and in 2009 demonstrated that XA21 recognizes a highly conserved peptide, called 'Ax21' (activator of XA21-mediated immunity). Tyrosine sulfation of Ax21 is required for recognition by rice XA21. A decade of genetic, molecular and biochemical studies have uncovered key components of the XA21-mediated signalling cascade. Ax21 recognition by XA21 at the cell surface induces phosphorylation-mediated events, which are predicted to alter subcellular localization and/or DNA-binding activity of a WRKY family of transcription factors. Because XA21 is representative of the large number of predicted pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in rice (n = 328), Arabidopsis (n = 35) and other plant species, further characterization of XA21-mediated signalling pathways will contribute to elucidation of these important defence responses.
20174657	Overexpression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP3 regulates XA21-mediated innate immunity in rice.	2010	PLoS One	Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the innate immune response. Although PRR-mediated signaling events are critical to the survival of plants and animals, secretion and localization of PRRs have not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we report the in vivo interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP3 with the rice XA21 PRR, which confers resistance to the Gram negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We show that XA21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM). In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated immunity is compromised, XA21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited. BiP3 overexpression does not affect the general rice defense response, cell death or brassinolide-induced responses. These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance to Xoo.
20149131	OsSPX1 suppresses the function of OsPHR2 in the regulation of expression of OsPT2 and phosphate homeostasis in shoots of rice.	2010	Plant J	Phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants is required for plant growth and development, and is achieved by the coordination of Pi acquisition, translocation from roots to shoots, and remobilization within plants. Previous reports have demonstrated that over-expression of OsPHR2 (the homolog of AtPHR1) and knockdown of OsSPX1 result in accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in rice. Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene OsPT2 by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots. OsPT2 is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi. OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of OsPT2 by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of OsPT2 or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant. Our data also show that OsSPX1 is a negative regulator of OsPHR2 and is involved in the feedback of Pi-signaling network in roots that is defined by OsPHR2 and OsPHO2. This finding provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism of Pi uptake, translocation, allocation and homeostasis in plants.
22897567	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant J	Recent studies have shown that F-box proteins constitute a large family in eukaryotes, and play pivotal roles in regulating various developmental processes in plants. However, their functions in monocots are still obscure. In this study, we characterized a recessive mutant dwarf and deformed flower 1-1 (ddf1-1) in Oryza sativa (rice). The mutant is abnormal in both vegetative and reproductive development, with significant size reduction in all organs except the spikelet. DDF1 controls organ size by regulating both cell division and cell expansion. In the ddf1-1 spikelet, the specification of floral organs in whorls 2 and 3 is altered, with most lodicules and stamens being transformed into glume-like organs and pistil-like organs, respectively, but the specification of lemma/palea and pistil in whorls 1 and 4 is not affected. DDF1 encodes an F-box protein anchored in the nucleolus, and is expressed in almost all vegetative and reproductive tissues. Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B-class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL. In addition, DDF1 also negatively regulates the Arabidopsis LFY ortholog APO2, implying a functional connection between DDF1 and APO2. Collectively, these results revealed that DDF1, as a newly identified F-box gene, is a crucial genetic factor with pleiotropic functions for both vegetative growth and floral organ specification in rice. These findings provide additional insights into the molecular mechanism controlling monocot vegetative and reproductive development.
22874758	Reaction specificities of the ε-ionone-forming lycopene cyclase from rice (Oryza sativa) elucidated in vitro.	2012	FEBS Lett	Lycopene cyclases responsible for the formation of ε-ionone rings (LCYe) mark a plant-specific bifurcation of carotenogenesis. We investigated purified rice LCYe (OsLCYe) in a liposome-based biphasic assay system. OsLCYe depends on reduced flavin cofactors stabilizing a transient state formed during the non-redox cyclization reaction. In contrast to OsLCYb, OsLCYe produces predominantly monocyclic products and monocyclic carotene intermediates are not suitable substrates. Determination of the OsLCYe reaction specificities and the combined use of OsLCYb allow the characterization of the reaction sequence leading to heterocyclic carotenoids. It was also found that 5-cis-lycopene, which was thought to be decisive for ε-cyclization, was not involved in the reaction, with OsLCYe acting as an exclusion filter for this naturally occurring isomer.
22872757	Lysin motif-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6 play dual roles in peptidoglycan and chitin perception in rice innate immunity.	2012	Plant Cell	Plant innate immunity relies on successful detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of invading microbes via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plant cell surface. Here, we report two homologous rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif-containing proteins, LYP4 and LYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin. Live cell imaging and microsomal fractionation consistently revealed the plasma membrane localization of these proteins in rice cells. Transcription of these two genes could be induced rapidly upon exposure to bacterial pathogens or diverse MAMPs. Both proteins selectively bound PGN and chitin but not lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Accordingly, silencing of either LYP specifically impaired PGN- or chitin- but not LPS-induced defense responses in rice, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene activation, and callose deposition, leading to compromised resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae and fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Interestingly, pretreatment with excess PGN dramatically attenuated the alkalinization response of rice cells to chitin but not to flagellin; vice versa, pretreatment with chitin attenuated the response to PGN, suggesting that PGN and chitin engage overlapping perception components in rice. Collectively, our data support the notion that LYP4 and LYP6 are promiscuous PRRs for PGN and chitin in rice innate immunity.
22882529	The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance.	2012	Plant J	The phytohormone auxin plays a critical role in plant growth and development, and its spatial distribution largely depends on the polar localization of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carrier family members. In this study, we identify a putative auxin efflux carrier gene in rice, OsPIN3t, which acts in auxin polar transport but is also involved in the drought stress response in rice. We show that OsPIN3t-GFP fusion proteins are localized in plasma membranes, and this subcellular localization changes under 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatment. The tissue-specific expression patterns of OsPIN3t were also investigated using a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter, which showed that OsPIN3t was mainly expressed in vascular tissue. The GUS activity in OsPIN3tpro::GUS plants increased by NAA treatment and decreased by NPA treatment. Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport. Overexpression of OsPIN3t led to improved drought tolerance, and GUS activity significantly increased when OsPIN3tpro::GUS plants were subjected to 20% polyethylene glycol stress. Taken together, these results suggest that OsPIN3t is involved in auxin transport and the drought stress response, which suggests that a polar auxin transport pathway is involved in the regulation of the response to water stress in plants.
22913536	OsARF16, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Plant responses to auxin and phosphate (Pi) starvation are closely linked. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting auxin to phosphate starvation (-Pi) responses are largely unclear. Here, we show that OsARF16, an auxin response factor, functions in both auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The knockout of OsARF16 led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and -Pi response. OsARF16 expression and OsARF16::GUS staining in PR and LR of rice Nipponbare (NIP) were induced by indole acetic acid and -Pi treatments. In -Pi conditions, the shoot biomass of osarf16 was slightly reduced, and neither root growth nor iron content was induced, indicating that the knockout of OsARF16 led to loss of response to Pi deficiency in rice. Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in osarf16 and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi. These data first reveal the biological function of OsARF16, provide novel evidence of a linkage between auxin and -Pi responses and facilitate the development of new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi in rice.
22878205	Interdomain disulfide bridge in the rice granule bound starch synthase I catalytic domain as elucidated by X-ray structure analysis.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The catalytic domain of rice (Oryza sativa japonica) granule bound starch synthase I (OsGBSSI-CD) was overexpressed and the three-dimensional structures of the ligand-free and ADP-bound forms were determined. The structures were similar to those reported for bacterial and archaeal glycogen synthases, which belong to glycosyltransferase family 5. They had Rossmann fold N- and C-domains connected by canonical two-hinge peptides, and an interdomain disulfide bond that appears to be conserved in the Poaceae plant family. The presence of three covalent linkages might explain why both OsGBSSI-CD structures adopted only the closed domain arrangement.
22904148	Emerging roots alter epidermal cell fate through mechanical and reactive oxygen species signaling.	2012	Plant Cell	A central question in biology is how spatial information is conveyed to locally establish a developmental program. Rice (Oryza sativa) can survive flash floods by the emergence of adventitious roots from the stem. Epidermal cells that overlie adventitious root primordia undergo cell death to facilitate root emergence. Root growth and epidermal cell death are both controlled by ethylene. This study aimed to identify the signal responsible for the spatial control of cell death. Epidermal cell death correlated with the proximity to root primordia in wild-type and ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 plants, indicating that the root emits a spatial signal. Ethylene-induced root growth generated a mechanical force of ~18 millinewtons within 1 h. Force application to epidermal cells above root primordia caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner and was inhibited by 1-methylcyclopropene or diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Exposure of epidermal cells not overlying a root to either force and ethylene or force and the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole induced ectopic cell death. Genetic downregulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger METALLOTHIONEIN2b likewise promoted force-induced ectopic cell death. Hence, reprogramming of epidermal cell fate by the volatile plant hormone ethylene requires two signals: mechanosensing for spatial resolution and ROS for cell death signaling.
22888153	Studies on the rice LEAF INCLINATION1 (LC1), an IAA-amido synthetase, reveal the effects of auxin in leaf inclination control.	2013	Mol Plant	The angle of rice leaf inclination is an important agronomic trait and closely related to the yields and architecture of crops. Although few mutants with altered leaf angles have been reported, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated, especially whether hormones are involved in this process. Through genetic screening, a rice gain-of-function mutant leaf inclination1, lc1-D, was identified from the Shanghai T-DNA Insertion Population (SHIP). Phenotypic analysis confirmed the exaggerated leaf angles of lc1-D due to the stimulated cell elongation at the lamina joint. LC1 is transcribed in various tissues and encodes OsGH3-1, an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amido synthetase, whose homolog of Arabidopsis functions in maintaining the auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess IAA to various amino acids. Indeed, recombinant LC1 can catalyze the conjugation of IAA to Ala, Asp, and Asn in vitro, which is consistent with the decreased free IAA amount in lc1-D mutant. lc1-D is insensitive to IAA and hypersensitive to exogenous BR, in agreement with the microarray analysis that reveals the altered transcriptions of genes involved in auxin signaling and BR biosynthesis. These results indicate the crucial roles of auxin homeostasis in the leaf inclination control.
22889013	Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Sphingolipids, including sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), have been shown to function as signaling mediators to regulate diverse aspects of plant growth, development, and stress response. In this study, we performed functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) S1P lyase gene OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco plants and explored its possible involvement in abiotic stress response. Overexpression of OsSPL1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, when compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the expression levels of some selected stress-related genes in OsSPL1-overexpressing plants were reduced after application of salt or oxidative stress, indicating that the altered responsiveness of stress-related genes may be responsible for the reduced tolerance in OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants under salt and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that rice OsSPL1 plays an important role in abiotic stress responses.
22912900	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering.	2012	PLoS One	Arabidopsis thaliana early flowering 3 (ELF3) as a zeitnehmer (time taker) is responsible for generation of circadian rhythm and regulation of photoperiodic flowering. There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
22892321	The histone methyltransferase SDG724 mediates H3K36me2/3 deposition at MADS50 and RFT1 and promotes flowering in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	Chromatin modifications affect flowering time in the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana, but the role of histone methylation in flowering time regulation of rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, remains to be elucidated. We identified a late-flowering long vegetative phase1 (lvp1) mutant in rice and used map-based cloning to reveal that lvp1 affects the SET domain group protein 724 (SDG724). SDG724 functions as a histone methyltransferase in vitro and contributes to a major fraction of global histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation in vivo. Expression analyses of flowering time genes in wild-type and lvp1 mutants revealed that Early heading date1, but not Heading date1, are misregulated in lvp1 mutants. In addition, the double mutant of lvp1 with photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5) flowered later than the se5 single mutant, indicating that lvp1 delays flowering time irrespective of photoperiod. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that lvp1 had reduced levels of H3K36me2/3 at MADS50 and RFT1. This suggests that the divergent functions of paralogs RFT1 and Hd3a, and of MADS50 and MADS51, are in part due to differential H3K36me2/3 deposition, which also correlates with higher expression levels of MADS50 and RFT1 in flowering promotion in rice.
22894565	Histone acetyltransferases in rice (Oryza sativa L.): phylogenetic analysis, subcellular localization and expression.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) play an important role in eukaryotic transcription. Eight HATs identified in rice (OsHATs) can be organized into four families, namely the CBP (OsHAC701, OsHAC703, and OsHAC704), TAFII250 (OsHAF701), GNAT (OsHAG702, OsHAG703, and OsHAG704), and MYST (OsHAM701) families. The biological functions of HATs in rice remain unknown, so a comprehensive protein sequence analysis of the HAT families was conducted to investigate their potential functions. In addition, the subcellular localization and expression patterns of the eight OsHATs were analyzed.

RESULTS: On the basis of a phylogenetic and domain analysis, monocotyledonous CBP family proteins can be subdivided into two groups, namely Group I and Group II. Similarly, dicotyledonous CBP family proteins can be divided into two groups, namely Group A and Group B. High similarities of protein sequences, conserved domains and three-dimensional models were identified among OsHATs and their homologs in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. Subcellular localization predictions indicated that all OsHATs might localize in both the nucleus and cytosol. Transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts confirmed the nuclear and cytosolic localization of OsHAC701, OsHAG702, and OsHAG704. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the eight OsHATs were expressed in all tissues examined with significant differences in transcript abundance, and their expression was modulated by abscisic acid and salicylic acid as well as abiotic factors such as salt, cold, and heat stresses.

CONCLUSIONS: Both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous CBP family proteins can be divided into two distinct groups, which suggest the possibility of functional diversification. The high similarities of protein sequences, conserved domains and three-dimensional models among OsHATs and their homologs in Arabidopsis and maize suggested that OsHATs have multiple functions. OsHAC701, OsHAG702, and OsHAG704 were localized in both the nucleus and cytosol in transient expression analyses with Arabidopsis protoplasts. OsHATs were expressed constitutively in rice, and their expression was regulated by exogenous hormones and abiotic stresses, which suggested that OsHATs may play important roles in plant defense responses.
22888152	OsELF3 is involved in circadian clock regulation for promoting flowering under long-day conditions in rice.	2013	Mol Plant	Heading date is a critical trait that determines cropping seasons and regional adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa). Research efforts during the last decade have identified some important photoperiod pathway genes that are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Oryza sativa ELF3 (OsELF3), which is a putative homolog of the ELF3 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsELF3 was required for the control of heading date under long-day conditions. Its Tos17-tagging mutants exhibited a delayed heading date phenotype only under long-day, but not short-day, conditions. OsELF3 was highly expressed in leaf blades, and the OsELF3 protein was localized in the nucleolus. An obvious diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 transcript level was observed, with a trough in the early day and a peak in the late night in wild-type plants. However, this expression pattern was disrupted in oself3 mutants. Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions. The rhythmic expression of circadian clock-related genes, including some OsPRR members, was obviously affected in oself3 mutants. Our results indicated that OsELF3 acts as a floral activator in the long-day photoperiodic pathway via its crosstalk with the circadian clock in rice.

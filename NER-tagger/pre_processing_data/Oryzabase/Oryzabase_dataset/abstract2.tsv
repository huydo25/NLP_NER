8604305	Sequences homologous to yeast mitochondrial and bacteriophage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases are widespread throughout the eukaryotic lineage.	1996	Nucleic Acids Res	Although mitochondria and chloroplasts are considered to be descendants of eubacteria-like endo- symbionts, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase of yeast is a nucleus-encoded, single-subunit enzyme homologous to bacteriophage T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, rather than a multi-component, eubacterial-type alpha 2 beta beta' enzyme, as encoded in chloroplast DNA. To broaden our knowledge of the mitochondrial transcriptional apparatus, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach designed to amplify an internal portion of phage T3/T7-like RNA polymerase genes. Using this strategy, we have recovered sequences homologous to yeast mitochondrial and phage T3/T7 RNA polymerases from a phylogenetically broad range of multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes. These organisms display diverse patterns of mitochondrial genome organization and expression, and include species that separated from the main eukaryotic line early in the evolution of this lineage. In certain cases, we can deduce that PCR-amplified sequences, some of which contain small introns, are localized in nuclear DNA. We infer that the T3/T7-like RNA polymerase sequences reported here are likely derived from genes encoding the mitochondrial RNA polymerase in the organisms in which they occur, suggesting a phage T3/T7-like RNA polymerase was recruited to act in transcription in the mitochondrion at an early stage in the evolution of this organelle.
10080713	Molecular characterization of catalytic-subunit cDNA sequences encoding protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and study of their roles in the gibberellin-dependent Osamy-c expression in rice.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	To understand the molecular mechanism of gibberellin-dependent gene regulation, the effect of three phosphatase inhibitors on the germination of rice seeds and the expression of a target gene, the alpha-amylase gene, Osamy-c, were measured. We found that okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, and calyculin A, which are known to specifically inhibit Ser/Thr phosphatases 1 and 2A, strongly inhibit the expression of the Osamy-c and may be involved in the germination of rice seeds. The protein phosphatase enzyme activity assays showed that there is no obvious effect of GA3 on total PP1/PP2A activities. To further understand the possible role of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in the GA-dependent expression of Osamy-c, we isolated cDNA clones encoding protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A from a rice aleurone cDNA library. These were designated OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac with the catalytic subunits of PP1 or PP2A of rabbit skeletal muscle, Arabidopsis thaliana, maize and Brassica napus showed that the catalytic subunit sequences of PP1 or PP2A among these organisms are highly conserved (73% to 90% similarity). Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated that there are only one or two copies of OsPP1c genes and more than two copies of OsPP2Ac genes in the rice genome. Northern blot analysis showed that OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac genes are expressed in several organs of rice, including seed, shoot and root. We also showed by using 3' gene-specific probes of OsPP1c and OsPP2Ac cDNA, that the expression of neither gene is regulated by GA. Taken together, our results suggest that protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A are involved in the GA-dependent expression of the rice Osamy-c gene, though the PP1 or/and PP2A enzymatic activities as well as mRNA levels do not increase upon GA3 treatment.
12956528	OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	The SAP domain is a recently defined DNA binding domain that forms a helix-extended-helix structure. SAP proteins have been implicated in nuclear architecture and/or RNA metabolism. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsBP-73, encoding a 375 amino acid protein with a SAP-like domain. We identified the binding sequence of OsBP-73 by gel retardation assays and southwestern blotting. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed. OsBP-73 gene expression was also examined by histochemical studies of transgenic rice plants carrying an OsBP-73 5'/GUS reporter gene. The reporter gene is mainly expressed in the tissues with high cell division activities, such as root tip, stem node, panicle and immature seed. Genetic interference of OsBP-73 gene expression by double-stranded RNA strikingly inhibits the whole plant growth but does not affect the passage from the juvenile to adult phase. These results suggest that OsBP-73 may play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation.

9096411	Microcolinearity in sh2-homologous regions of the maize, rice, and sorghum genomes.	1997	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Large regions of genomic colinearity have been demonstrated among grass species by recombinational mapping, but the degree of chromosomal conservation at the sub-centimorgan level has not been extensively investigated. We cloned the rice and sorghum genes homologous to the sh2 locus of maize on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), and observed that a homologue of the maize a1 gene was also present on each of these BACs. In sorghum, we found a direct duplication of a1 homologues separated by about 10 kb. In maize, sh2 and a1 are approximately 140 kb apart and transcribed in the same direction, with sh2 upstream of a1. In rice and sorghum, this arrangement is fully conserved. However, the sh2 and a1 homologues are separated by about 19 kb in both rice and sorghum. We found low-copy-number and repetitive DNAs between the sh2 and a1 homologues of sorghum and rice. The sh2 and a1 homologues cross-hybridized, but the repetitive DNA and most low-copy-number sequences between these genes did not. These results indicate that maize, sorghum, and rice have conserved gene order and composition in the sh2-a1 region, but have acquired extensive qualitative and quantitative differences in the sequences between these genes.
1422207	Rice cystatin: bacterial expression, purification, cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity, and insect growth suppressing activity of a truncated form of the protein.	1992	Protein Expr Purif	A cDNA clone that encodes oryzacystatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor from rice, was isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) using an expression plasmid under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The construct pT7OC 9b encoded a fusion protein containing 11 amino acid residues of the NH2 terminus of the bacterial protein phi 10 and 79 residues of oryzacystatin lacking 23 NH2-terminal residues of the wild-type protein. Recombinant oryzacystatin (ROC) constituted approximately 10% of the total bacterial protein mass and was purified in a single step by anion-exchange chromatography. The inhibitory activity of ROC toward papain (Ki = 3 x 10(-8) M) was comparable with that of the naturally occurring protein isolated from rice. Caseinolytic activity in midgut homogenates from seven species of stored product insects was inhibited from 18 to 85% by ROC, whereas the same activity was inhibited from 14 to 69% by the serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Midguts of stored product insects apparently contain both cysteine proteinases and serine proteinases, but the relative amounts vary with the species. When fed to the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, 10 wt% ROC in the diet suppressed growth approximately 35% relative to that of the control group of insects.

10437831	Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding mitochondrial phosphate transporters in soybean, maize, rice, and Arabidopis.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	cDNA clones encoding mitochondrial phosphate transporters were isolated from four herbaceous plants. The cDNAs for the soybean, maize and rice transporters contained entire coding regions, whereas the Arabidopsis cDNA lacked the 5' portion. The hydropathy profiles of the deduced amino acid sequences predicted the existence of six membrane-spanning domains which are highly conserved in the mitochondrial transporter family. In soybeans, the mRNA level for the transporter was high in tissues containing dividing cells. It was suggested that there are multiple copies of transporter genes in both dicots and monocots. The soybean transporter was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, solubilized with detergents, and then reconstituted into liposomes. The resulting proteoliposomes exhibited high phosphate transport activity. The activity was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, like those of mammalian phosphate transporters.
7948880	Induction of chilling resistance by water stress, and cDNA sequence analysis and expression of water stress-regulated genes in rice.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	Exposure of seedlings of a chilling-sensitive variety of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Wasetoittu) to water stress (0.5 M mannitol, 30 min) at room temperature induced a degree of chilling resistance. No such resistance was induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application (10 microM, 60 min). Upon short-term water stress, new transcripts were expressed in both seedlings and suspension-cultured cells. We suggest that the genes induced by short-term water stress, and not those induced by ABA, are related to acquired chilling resistance in this chilling-sensitive rice variety. A total of nine different cDNA clones, specifically induced by short-term water stress, were isolated by differential hybridization and partial sequencing. Northern hybridization analysis using RNAs from the seedlings subjected to chilling after water stress treatment reveal three distinct groups of above mentioned nine cDNA clones: wsi (water stress-induced) 18, 76, and 724, representative of genes whose expression increases, decreases, and remains almost fixed during chilling, respectively. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the three representative clones were determined. Characteristic features of wsi18 are the presence of one set of amino acid sequence repeats, a conserved amino acid sequence common to LEA-group genes in the N-terminal region, and an alanine- and lysine-rich tract in the C-terminal region.
11416158	Hd6, a rice quantitative trait locus involved in photoperiod sensitivity, encodes the alpha subunit of protein kinase CK2.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hd6 is a quantitative trait locus involved in rice photoperiod sensitivity. It was detected in backcross progeny derived from a cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare and the indica variety Kasalath. To isolate a gene at Hd6, we used a large segregating population for the high-resolution and fine-scale mapping of Hd6 and constructed genomic clone contigs around the Hd6 region. Linkage analysis with P1-derived artificial chromosome clone-derived DNA markers delimited Hd6 to a 26.4-kb genomic region. We identified a gene encoding the alpha subunit of protein kinase CK2 (CK2 alpha) in this region. The Nipponbare allele of CK2 alpha contains a premature stop codon, and the resulting truncated product is undoubtedly nonfunctional. Genetic complementation analysis revealed that the Kasalath allele of CK2 alpha increases days-to-heading. Map-based cloning with advanced backcross progeny enabled us to identify a gene underlying a quantitative trait locus even though it exhibited a relatively small effect on the phenotype.
12028574	EL5, a rice N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor-responsive RING-H2 finger protein, is a ubiquitin ligase which functions in vitro in co-operation with an elicitor-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, OsUBC5b.	2002	Plant J	EL5, a rice gene responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor, encodes a RING-H2 finger protein with structural features common to the plant-specific ATL family. We show that the fusion protein of EL5 with maltose binding protein (MBP) was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and the Ubc4/5 subfamily of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). EL5 possesses the activity to catalyse the transfer of ubiquitin to the MBP moiety, and the RING-H2 finger motif of EL5 is necessary for this activity. Thus, we concluded that EL5 represents a ubiquitin ligase (E3). We also show that two rice E2s (OsUBC5a, OsUBC5b) of the Ubc4/5 subfamily function as E2 which catalyses EL5-mediated ubiquitination, and OsUBC5b was induced by elicitor, as well as EL5. These results strongly suggest that EL5 and OsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system.
1840621	Genomic DNA sequences of two new genes for new storage protein glutelin in rice.	1991	Jpn J Genet	A new cDNA and two genomic genes encoding the rice storage protein glutelin were isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of one gene (GluA-3) was completely identical with that of the new cDNA identified here, and the other (GluA-4) was a pseudogene. These glutelin genes were closely related to each other, and belonged to the subfamily A containing the type I (GluA-1) and II (GluA-2) glutelin genes. The Northern blot analysis, using synthetic oligonucleotide specific to the GluA-3 gene as a probe, showed that this gene was expressed earlier than other glutelin genes during seed maturation.
6087286	The complete nucleotide sequence of a rice 17S rRNA gene.	1984	Nucleic Acids Res	The complete nucleotide sequence of a rice nuclear 17S rRNA gene (rDNA) has been determined. The rice rDNA is 1812 bp long and its G + C content is 51.3%. This nucleotide sequence shows 79%, 80% and 80% homology to those of yeast, Xenopus laevis and rat 18S rDNAs, respectively. Divergency of nucleotide sequences is largely attributed to five blocks of highly variable regions, where eukaryotic specific sequences can be observed.
3902573	The complete nucleotide sequence of a rice 25S.rRNA gene.	1985	Gene	The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a rice nuclear 25S.rRNA gene has been determined. The 25S.rRNA-coding region is 3377 bp long. The G + C content is 59.4%. The structural organization of this rRNA is very similar to that of yeast 26S rRNA.

1888896	Analysis of the 5' flanking region responsible for the endosperm-specific expression of a rice glutelin chimeric gene in transgenic tobacco.	1991	Plant Mol Biol	The 5' upstream region of the rice storage protein type II glutelin gene was examined for its regulatory function in transgenic tobacco. Chimeric genes containing 5' flanking regions of the glutelin gene transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were introduced into the tobacco genome by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. The chimeric genes were expressed specifically in developing seeds, as opposed to leaves and stems, of the transgenic tobacco. Histochemical analysis revealed that the GUS activity was restricted to the endosperm tissue. A deletion series of the 5' flanking region was created from position -1329 to -74 relative to the transcriptional initiation site and similarly examined in transgenic tobacco. Measurement of GUS activity of the seeds from the transgenic plants bearing the chimeric genes indicated that the region between positions -441 and -237 was required for the temporal and endosperm-specific expression of the GUS activity in tobacco. RNA analysis by northern blotting confirmed the importance of the -441 to -237 region. Addition of up to 888 bp to the -441 deletion resulted in little increase in GUS activity, although all constructs expressing the GUS gene showed a similar tissue and temporal regulation pattern.
1680490	Sequence of three members and expression of a new major subfamily of glutelin genes from rice.	1991	Plant Mol Biol	Three members have been isolated of an additional glutelin gene subfamily, named subfamily B, consisting of about five members per haploid rice genome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed major differences between Japonica and Indica lines, indicating the divergence of the subfamily since the split between the two varieties. While corresponding exons of the subfamily B showed 80 to 88% nucleotide sequence homology, those exons were only 60-65% homologous to those of the glutelin A subfamily, distinguishing them from the subfamily A. Intron position and derived polypeptide structure, in addition to the nucleotide sequence, confirm the subfamily B members as glutelins. Analysis of RNA from seeds of different stages of development showed that the subfamily B members were expressed at the same time as those of subfamily A, demonstrating coordinated regulation of the two subfamilies.
10890535	Flower-predominant expression of a gene encoding a novel class I chitinase in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2000	Plant Mol Biol	A flower-predominant cDNA for a gene, termed OsChia 1;175, was isolated from a cDNA library of rice pistils. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed that the OsChia 1;175 gene is highly expressed in floral organs (pistils, stamens and lodicules at the heading stage) but not or at an extremely low level in vegetative organs. OsChia 1;175 encodes a protein that consists of 340 amino acid residues, and the putative mature protein shows 52% to 63% amino acid identity to class I chitinases of rice or other plants. The phylogenetic tree shows that the OsChia 1;175 protein is a new type of plant class I chitinase in rice. The expression of OsChia 1;175 in vegetative organs is not induced by several chemicals, UV, and wounding. The soluble putative mature OsChia 1;175 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited chitinase activity in the assay with colloidal chitin as a substrate. Genomic Southern analysis revealed that the OsChia 1;175 gene was organized as a low-copy gene family. The rice genomic library was screened and a genome clone corresponding to OsChia 1;175 was isolated. The transcription start sites of the OsChia 1;175 gene were mapped by primer extension analysis. The 1.2 kb putative promoter region of the OsChia 1;175 gene was fused to the GUS (beta-glucuronidase) gene, and this chimeric gene was introduced to rice by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The flower-predominant gene expression was identified also in the transgenic rice plants. The high promoter activity was detected in the stigmas, styles, stamens and lodicules in transgenic plants. The possible functions of OsChia 1;175 are discussed.
9870704	Rice has two distinct classes of protein kinase genes related to SNF1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which are differently regulated in early seed development.	1998	Mol Gen Genet	We have isolated five cDNA clones (osk1-5) for protein kinases from rice which are related to SNF1 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the sequence homology, these cDNAs can be classified into two groups, group 1 (osk1) and group 2 (osk2-5). The products of these genes were demonstrated to be functional SNF1-related protein kinases by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Recombinant proteins expressed from both groups of genes were fully active as protein kinases and could phosphorylate SAMS peptide, a substrate specific for the SNF1/AMPK family, as well as themselves (autophosphorylation). Moreover, expression of osk3 cDNA in yeast snf1 mutants restored SNF1 function. Northern blot analyses showed differential expression of these two gene groups; group 1 is expressed uniformly in growing tissues (young roots, young shoots, flowers, and immature seeds), whereas group 2 is strongly expressed in immature seeds. SNF1-related protein kinases have been reported from different plant species, such as rye, barley, Arabidopsis, tobacco, and potato, while the type of gene strongly expressed in immature seeds is known only in cereals such as rye, barley, and, from our findings, in rice. Expression levels of the group 2 genes were further analyzed in seeds during seed maturation. Expression is transiently increased in the early stages of seed maturation and then decreases. The expression peak precedes those of the sbe1 and waxy genes, which are involved in starch synthesis in rice. Taken together, these findings suggest that group 2 OSK genes play important roles in the early stages of endosperm development in rice seeds.
16278346	Distinct and cooperative functions of phytochromes A, B, and C in the control of deetiolation and flowering in rice.	2005	Plant Cell	We have isolated phytochrome B (phyB) and phyC mutants from rice (Oryza sativa) and have produced all combinations of double mutants. Seedlings of phyB and phyB phyC mutants exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity to continuous red light (Rc) but still showed significant deetiolation responses. The responses to Rc were completely canceled in phyA phyB double mutants. These results indicate that phyA and phyB act in a highly redundant manner to control deetiolation under Rc. Under continuous far-red light (FRc), phyA mutants showed partially impaired deetiolation, and phyA phyC double mutants showed no significant residual phytochrome responses, indicating that not only phyA but also phyC is involved in the photoperception of FRc in rice. Interestingly, the phyB phyC double mutant displayed clear R/FR reversibility in the pulse irradiation experiments, indicating that both phyA and phyB can mediate the low-fluence response for gene expression. Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time. The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
10503544	Homologs of animal eyes absent (eya) genes are found in higher plants.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	Homologs of the eyes absent (eya) gene in animals function at multiple stages in the development of organs. Their functional roles in the genetic network that regulates eye development in Drosophila have recently been extensively analyzed. A rice homolog of eya was identified from a cDNA library made from embryo RNA. The corresponding gene (OSEya1) encodes a conserved ED1 domain and a short N-terminal peptide. The ED1 domain of OSEya1 shows 25% identity and 36% similarity to the product of Drosophila eya. Mammalian and squid eya homologs show about 35% similarity to OSEya1. Homologous sequences were also found in the alfalfa EST database (53% identity and 65% similarity to OSEya1) and in the Arabidopsis genome sequence (63% identity). Therefore, eya homologs are present in both monocots and dicots. Three regions in the ED1 domain are well conserved in animals and plants. Plant eya products deduced from the nucleotide sequences also have short N-terminal peptides. The OSEya1 gene is located between the wx gene and the telomere on the short arm of chromosome 6. OSEya1 is expressed in the embryo, shoot apex, and caryopsis in rice. Expression in the embryo increases during embryogenesis until 7 days after pollination, with preferential localization in leaf primordia and the shoot apical meristem. Expression in the influorescence was observed in floral meristems. The functions of OSEya1 in higher plants are discussed and compared with those of their animal homologs. OSEya1 might regulate the morphogenesis of lateral organs as a subunit of a transcription factor.
11950970	The rice mutant esp2 greatly accumulates the glutelin precursor and deletes the protein disulfide isomerase.	2002	Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates prolamins and glutelins as storage proteins. The latter storage protein is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a 57-kD proglutelin precursor, which is then processed into acidic and basic subunits in the protein storage vacuole. Three esp2 mutants, CM1787, EM44, and EM747, contain larger amounts of the 57-kD polypeptide and corresponding lower levels of acidic and basic glutelin subunits than normal. Electron microscopic observation revealed that esp2 contained normal-appearing glutelin-containing protein bodies (PB-II), but lacked the normal prolamin-containing PB (PB-I). Instead, numerous small ER-derived PBs of uniform size (0.5 microm in diameter) and low electron density were readily observed. Immunoblot analysis of purified subcellular fractions and immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopy level showed that these new PBs contained the 57-kD proglutelin precursor and prolamin polypeptides. The 57-kD proglutelin was extracted with 1% (v/v) lactic acid solution only after removal of cysteine-rich prolamin polypeptides, suggesting that these proteins form glutelin-prolamin aggregates via interchain disulfide bonds within the ER lumen. The endosperm of esp2 mutants contains the lumenal chaperones, binding protein and calnexin, but lacks protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) at the protein and RNA levels. The transcript of PDI was expressed in the seed only during the early stage of seed development in the wild type. These results suggest that PDI plays an essential role in the segregation of proglutelin and prolamin polypeptides within the ER lumen.
15345035	Adaptive evolution of centromere proteins in plants and animals.	2004	J Biol	BACKGROUND: Centromeres represent the last frontiers of plant and animal genomics. Although they perform a conserved function in chromosome segregation, centromeres are typically composed of repetitive satellite sequences that are rapidly evolving. The nucleosomes of centromeres are characterized by a special H3-like histone (CenH3), which evolves rapidly and adaptively in Drosophila and Arabidopsis. Most plant, animal and fungal centromeres also bind a large protein, centromere protein C (CENP-C), that is characterized by a single 24 amino-acid motif (CENPC motif).

RESULTS: Whereas we find no evidence that mammalian CenH3 (CENP-A) has been evolving adaptively, mammalian CENP-C proteins contain adaptively evolving regions that overlap with regions of DNA-binding activity. In plants we find that CENP-C proteins have complex duplicated regions, with conserved amino and carboxyl termini that are dissimilar in sequence to their counterparts in animals and fungi. Comparisons of Cenpc genes from Arabidopsis species and from grasses revealed multiple regions that are under positive selection, including duplicated exons in some grasses. In contrast to plants and animals, yeast CENP-C (Mif2p) is under negative selection.

CONCLUSIONS: CENP-Cs in all plant and animal lineages examined have regions that are rapidly and adaptively evolving. To explain these remarkable evolutionary features for a single-copy gene that is needed at every mitosis, we propose that CENP-Cs, like some CenH3s, suppress meiotic drive of centromeres during female meiosis. This process can account for the rapid evolution and the complexity of centromeric DNA in plants and animals as compared to fungi.
7599652	Alternative RNA products from a rice homeobox gene.	1995	Plant J	Three cDNA clones were isolated from rice, OSH42, OSH44 and OSH45, which encode homeodomain sequences in the C-terminal region. The sequences of these cDNAs differ in the N- and C-termini, but they share an identical homeodomain and an acidic amino acid-rich region. The transcripts corresponding to these cDNAs are encoded by a single gene on rice chromosome 8. Differential transcription initiation results in a large transcript comprised of exons 1 and 3-7 and a smaller transcript comprised of exons 2-7. The larger transcript is constitutively expressed in all tissues tested, while the smaller transcript is expressed in leaves, stems and rachis but not in roots, flowers, or suspension callus cells. Alternative splicing also occurs at three different acceptor sites in intron 6 in all tissues tested. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain of yeast was used to study the function of various protein domains. The acidic amino acid-rich region activates the expression of a reporter gene controlled by the GAL4 target sequence, indicating that it functions as a transactivation domain. The larger transcript encodes a unique alanine and glycine-rich region on the N-terminal side of the acidic region, which is not encoded by the smaller transcript. This region completely suppresses the transactivation activity of the acidic region. This suggests that the product of the larger transcript fails to activate the expression of the target gene(s) while the product of the smaller transcript activates the expression of its target gene(s).
15705958	A novel cytochrome P450 is implicated in brassinosteroid biosynthesis via the characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf11, with reduced seed length.	2005	Plant Cell	We have characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf11 (d11), that bears seeds of reduced length. To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the D11 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method. The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P450 (CYP724B1), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. The dwarf phenotype of d11 mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL). Compared with wild-type plants, the aberrant D11 mRNA accumulated at higher levels in d11 mutants and was dramatically reduced by treatment with BL, implying that the gene is feedback-regulated by BL. Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants. However, 6-deoxotyphasterol (6-DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d11 mutants in a lamina joint bending assay. Multiple lines of evidence together suggest that the D11/CYP724B1 gene plays a role in BR synthesis and may be involved in the supply of 6-DeoxoTY and TY in the BR biosynthesis network in rice.
7610165	Structure, organization, and chromosomal location of the gene encoding a form of rice soluble starch synthase.	1995	Plant Physiol	A rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic clone encoding the gene for a form of soluble starch synthase (SSS1) and its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions has been isolated and sequenced. The SSS1 gene contained 15 exons interrupted by 14 introns. The exon/intron organization of the SSS1 gene was divergent from that of the rice Waxy gene coding for granule-bound starch synthase, thus suggesting that the SSS1 and granule-bound starch synthase genes have evolved from an ancestral gene in a different way or that the two genes are products of different ancestral genes that have converged during evolution. However, these two genes were closely located to each other on rice chromosome 6 at an approximate map distance of 5 centimorgans. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-end region of the gene is unique because of the presence of some repetitive sequences.
9150612	dad-1, A putative programmed cell death suppressor gene in rice.	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	The human dad-1 cDNA homolog was isolated from rice plants. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein product is well conserved in both animals and plants. This rice dad-1 homolog can rescue the temperature-sensitive dad-1 mutants of hamster cells from apoptotic death, suggesting that the rice dad-1 homolog also functions as a suppressor for programmed cell death.
15122023	A comparison of rice chloroplast genomes.	2004	Plant Physiol	Using high quality sequence reads extracted from our whole genome shotgun repository, we assembled two chloroplast genome sequences from two rice (Oryza sativa) varieties, one from 93-11 (a typical indica variety) and the other from PA64S (an indica-like variety with maternal origin of japonica), which are both parental varieties of the super-hybrid rice, LYP9. Based on the patterns of high sequence coverage, we partitioned chloroplast sequence variations into two classes, intravarietal and intersubspecific polymorphisms. Intravarietal polymorphisms refer to variations within 93-11 or PA64S. Intersubspecific polymorphisms were identified by comparing the major genotypes of the two subspecies represented by 93-11 and PA64S, respectively. Some of the minor genotypes occurring as intravarietal polymorphisms in one variety existed as major genotypes in the other subspecific variety, thus giving rise to intersubspecific polymorphisms. In our study, we found that the intersubspecific variations of 93-11 (indica) and PA64S (japonica) chloroplast genomes consisted of 72 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 27 insertions or deletions. The intersubspecific polymorphism rates between 93-11 and PA64S were 0.05% for single nucleotide polymorphisms and 0.02% for insertions or deletions, nearly 8 and 10 times lower than their respective nuclear genomes. Based on the total number of nucleotide substitutions between the two chloroplast genomes, we dated the divergence of indica and japonica chloroplast genomes as occurring approximately 86,000 to 200,000 years ago.
10715324	The complete sequence of 340 kb of DNA around the rice Adh1-adh2 region reveals interrupted colinearity with maize chromosome 4.	2000	Plant Cell	A 2.3-centimorgan (cM) segment of rice chromosome 11 consisting of 340 kb of DNA sequence around the alcohol dehydrogenase Adh1 and Adh2 loci was completely sequenced, revealing the presence of 33 putative genes, including several apparently involved in disease resistance. Fourteen of the genes were confirmed by identifying the corresponding transcripts. Five genes, spanning 1.9 cM of the region, cross-hybridized with maize genomic DNA and were genetically mapped in maize, revealing a stretch of colinearity with maize chromosome 4. The Adh1 gene marked one significant interruption. This gene mapped to maize chromosome 1, indicating a possible translocation of Adh1 after the evolutionary divergence leading to maize and sorghum. Several other genes, most notably genes similar to known disease resistance genes, showed no cross-hybridization with maize genomic DNA, suggesting sequence divergence or absence of these sequences in maize, which is in contrast to several other well-conserved genes, including Adh1 and Adh2. These findings indicate that the use of rice as the model system for other cereals may sometimes be complicated by the presence of rapidly evolving gene families and microtranslocations. Seven retrotransposons and eight transposons were identified in this rice segment, including a Tc1/Mariner-like element, which is new to rice. In contrast to maize, retroelements are less frequent in rice. Only 14.4% of this genome segment consist of retroelements. Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements were found to be the most frequently occurring class of repetitive elements, accounting for 18.8% of the total repetitive DNA.
14513380	Characterization of two rice DNA methyltransferase genes and RNAi-mediated reactivation of a silenced transgene in rice callus.	2004	Planta	Two genomic clones ( OsMET1-1, AF 462029 and OsMET1-2, TPA BK001405), each encoding a cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (MTase), were isolated from rice ( Oryza sativa L.) BAC libraries. OsMET1-1 has an open reading frame of 4,566 nucleotides with 12 exons and 11 introns while OsMET1-2 has an open reading frame of 4,491 nucleotides with 11 exons and 10 introns. Although OsMET1-1 and OsMET1-2 have high sequence similarity overall, they share only 24% identity in exon 1, and intron 3 of OsMET1-1 is absent from OsMET1-2. As for other eukaryotic DNA MTases of the Dnmt1/MET l class, the derived amino acid sequences of OsMET1-1 and OsMET1-2 suggest that they are comprised of two-thirds regulatory domain and one-third catalytic domain. Most functional domains identified for other MTases were present in the rice MET1 sequences. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated high similarity (56-75% identity) of rice MET1 proteins to other plant MET1 sequences but limited similarity (approx. 24% identity) to animal Dnmt1 proteins. Genomic blot and database analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of OsMET1-1 (on chromosome 3) and single copy of OsMET1-2 (on chromosome 7). Ribonuclease protection assays revealed expression of both OsMET1-1 and OsMET1-2 in highly dividing cells, but the steady-state level of OsMET1-2 was 7- to 12-fold higher than that for OsMET1-1 in callus, root and inflorescence. The functional involvement of the rice DNA MTases in gene silencing was investigated using an RNAi strategy. Inverted repeat constructs of either the N- or C-terminal regions of OsMET1-1 were supertransformed into calli derived from a rice line bearing a silenced 35S-uidA-nos transgene. Restoration of uidA expression in the bombarded calli was consistent with the inactivation of maintenance methylation and with previous evidence for the involvement of methylation in silencing of this line.
15599508	Analysis of the molecular evolutionary history of the ascorbate peroxidase gene family: inferences from the rice genome.	2004	J Mol Evol	Ascorbate peroxidase (APx) is a class I peroxidase that catalyzes the conversion of H(2)O(2) to H(2)O and O(2) using ascorbate as the specific electron donor. This enzyme has a key function in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the protection against toxic effects of ROS in higher plants, algae, and Euglena. Here we report the identification of an APx multigene family in rice and propose a molecular evolutionary relationship between the diverse APx isoforms. In rice, the APx gene family has eight members, which encode two cytosolic, two putative peroxisomal, and four chloroplastic isoforms, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using all APx protein sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results indicate that the different APx isoforms arose by a complex evolutionary process involving several gene duplications. The structural organization of APx genes also reflects this process and provides evidence for a close relationship among proteins located in the same subcellular compartment. A molecular evolutionary pathway, in which cytosolic and peroxisomal isoforms diverged early from chloroplastic ones, is proposed.
7808393	Transposition of Tnr1 in rice genomes to 5'-PuTAPy-3' sites, duplicating the TA sequence.	1994	Mol Gen Genet	Tnr1 is a repetitive sequence in rice with several features characteristic of a transposable DNA element. Its copy number was estimated to be about 3500 per haploid genome by slot-blot hybridization. We have isolated six members of Tnr1 located at different loci by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and determined their nucleotide sequences. The Tnr1 elements were similar in size and highly homologous (about 85%) to the Tnr1 sequence identified first in the Waxy gene in Oryza glaberrima. A consensus sequence of 235 bp could be derived from the nucleotide sequences of all the Tnr1 members. The consensus sequence showed that base substitutions occurred frequently in Tnr1 by transition, and that Tnr1 has terminal inverted repeat sequences of 75 bp. Almost all the chromosomal sequences that flank the Tnr1 members were 5'-PuTA-3' and 5'-TAPy-3', indicating that Tnr1 transposed to 5'-PuTAPy-3' sites, duplicating the TA sequence. PCR-amplified fragments from some rice species did not contain the Tnr1 members at corresponding loci. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the fragments with or without a Tnr1 member confirmed preferential transposition of Tnr1 to 5'-PuTAPy-3' sites, duplicating the TA sequence. One amplified sequence suggested that imprecise excision had occurred to remove a DNA segment containing a Tnr1 member and its neighboring sequences at the Waxy locus of rice species with genome types other than AA. We also present data that may suggest that Tnr1 is a defective form of an autonomous transposable element.
8541663	Cloning and nucleotide sequence of a leaf ferredoxin-nitrite reductase cDNA of rice.	1995	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	A ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (EC 1.7.7.1) cDNA was isolated and sequenced from a lambda gt 11 cDNA library constructed from nitrate-induced greening shoots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 1788 nucleotides. There exists a strong bias for the third codon usage of G/C (95.5%) as in the case of the maize enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence shows an overall homology to the maize (81%) and the dicot enzymes (70-74%), suggesting that the primary structure of ferredoxin-nitrite reductase is highly conserved in higher plants.
15653803	Ultraviolet-B sensitivities in Japanese lowland rice cultivars: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase activity and gene mutation.	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	There is a cultivar difference in the response to ultraviolet-B (UVB: 280-320 nm) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Among Japanese lowland rice cultivars, Sasanishiki, a leading Japanese rice cultivar, is resistant to the damaging effects of UVB while Norin 1, a close relative, is less resistant. We found previously that Norin 1 was deficient in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photorepair ability and suggested that the UVB sensitivity in rice depends largely on CPD photorepair ability. In order to verify that suggestion, we examined the correlation between UVB sensitivity and CPD photolyase activity in 17 rice cultivars of progenitors and relatives in breeding of UV-resistant Sasanishiki and UV-sensitive Norin 1. The amino acid at position 126 of the deduced amino acid sequence of CPD photolyase in cultivars including such as Norin 1 was found to be arginine, the CPD photolyase activities of which were lower. The amino acid at that position in cultivars including such as Sasanishiki was glutamine. Furthermore, cultivars more resistant to UVB were found to exhibit higher photolyase activities than less resistant cultivars. These results emphasize that single amino acid alteration from glutamine to arginine leads to a deficit of CPD photolyase activity and that CPD photolyase activity is one of the main factors determining UVB sensitivity in rice.
12068121	Molecular characterization and evolution of the protein phosphatase 2A B' regulatory subunit family in plants.	2002	Plant Physiol	Type 2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP2A) are important components in the reversible protein phosphorylation events in plants and other organisms. PP2A proteins are oligomeric complexes constituted by a catalytic subunit and several regulatory subunits that modulate the activity of these phosphatases. The analysis of the complete genome of Arabidopsis allowed us to characterize four novel genes, AtB'epsilon, AtB'zeta, AtB'eta, and AtB'theta;, belonging to the PP2A B' regulatory subunit family. Because four genes of this type had been described previously, this family is composed of eight members. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that AtB'epsilon mRNAs are present in all Arabidopsis tissues analyzed, and their levels do not respond significantly to heat stress. Expressed sequence tags corresponding to AtB'zeta, AtB'eta, and AtB'theta; have been identified, indicating that the new genes are actively transcribed. The genomic organization of this family of PP2A regulatory subunits is reported, as well as its chromosomal location. An extensive survey of the family has been carried out in plants, characterizing B' subunits in a number of different species, and performing a phylogenetic study that included several B' regulatory proteins from animals. Our results indicate that the animal and plant proteins have evolved independently, that there is a relationship between the number of B' isoforms and the complexity of the organism, and that there are at least three main subfamilies of regulatory subunits in plants, which we have named alpha, eta, and kappa.
9804992	A novel variant of translation elongation factor-1beta: isolation and characterization of the rice gene encoding EF-1beta2.	1998	Biochim Biophys Acta	A rice gene encoding a novel isoform of translation elongation factor-1beta subunit (termed EF-1beta2) was isolated and characterized. The gene comprises of eight exons, and encodes a 226-amino-acid protein. Expression of EF-1beta2 mRNA is abundant in seeds and cultured cells, but is considerably low in the tissues of the rice seedling. Antiserum raised against an EF-1beta2 synthetic peptide detected a protein with a relative molecular mass of about 32 kDa, indicating the EF-1beta2 gene is actually expressed in rice tissues. EF-1beta2 showed a close similarity to the cognate subunits from plant (beta and beta').
11759839	OsIAA1, an Aux/IAA cDNA from rice, and changes in its expression as influenced by auxin and light.	2001	DNA Res	The Aux/IAA class of genes are rapidly induced by exogenous auxins and have been characterized extensively from many dicot species like Arabidopsis, Glycine max and Pisum sativum. We report here the isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. Indica) OsIAA1 cDNA as a monocot member of the Aux/IAA gene family. The predicted amino acid sequence of OsIAA1 corresponds to a protein of ca. 26 kDa, which harbors all four characteristic domains known to be conserved in Aux/IAA proteins. The conservation of these Aux/IAA genes indicates that auxins have essentially a similar mode of action in monocots and dicots. Northern blot analysis revealed that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease in the excised coleoptile segments on auxin starvation, and the level is restored when auxin is supplemented; the increase in OsIAA1 transcript level was apparent within 15 to 30 min of auxin application. Auxin-induced OsIAA1 expression appears to be correlated with the elongation of excised coleoptile segments. In light-grown rice seedlings, OsIAA1 is preferentially expressed in roots and basal segment of the seedling, whereas in the etiolated rice seedlings, the OsIAA1 transcripts are most abundant in the coleoptile. A comparative analysis in light- and dark-grown seedling tissues indicates that the OsIAA1 transcript levels decrease on illumination.
14527713	A POLYCOMB group gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica), OsiEZ1, codes for a nuclear-localized protein expressed preferentially in young seedlings and during reproductive development.	2003	Gene	The SET domains are conserved amino acid sequences present in chromosomal proteins that contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression by altering regional organization of the chromatin structure. The SET domain proteins are divided into four subgroups as categorized by their Drosophila members; enhancer of zeste (E(Z)), trithorax (TRX), absent small or homeotic 1 (ASH1) and supressor of variegation (SU(VAR)3-9). Homologs of all four classes have been characterized in yeast, mammals and plants. We report here the isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica) cDNA, OsiEZ1, as a monocot member of this family. The OsiEZ1 cDNA is 3133 bp long with an ORF of 2799 bp, and the predicted amino acid sequence (895 residues) corresponds to a protein of ca. 98 kDa. All the characteristic domains known to be conserved in E(Z) homologs (subgroup I) of SET domain containing proteins are present in OsiEZ1. In the rice genome, a 7499 bp long OsiEZ1 sequence is split into 17 exons interrupted by 16 introns. Southern analysis indicates that OsiEZ1 is represented as single copy in the rice genome. Expression studies revealed that the OsiEZ1 transcript level was highest in rice flowers, almost undetectable in developing seeds of 1-2 days post-fertilization but increased significantly in young seeds of 3-5 days post-fertilization. The OsiEZ1 transcript was barely detectable in mature zygotic embryos, but its levels were significantly higher in callus derived from rice scutellum, somatic embryos and young seedlings. The OsiEZ1/GUS recombinant protein was confined to the nucleus in living cells of particle-bombarded onion peels. The expression of OsiEZ1 complemented a set1Delta Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that is impaired in telomeric silencing. We suggest that the nuclear-localized OsiEZ1 has a role in regulating various aspects of plant development, and this control is most likely brought about by repressing the activity of downstream regulatory genes.
16139905	Exogenous auxin enhances the degradation of a light down-regulated and nuclear-localized OsiIAA1, an Aux/IAA protein from rice, via proteasome.	2005	Biochim Biophys Acta	Auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development by altering the expression of diverse genes. Among these, the early auxin-responsive genes of Aux/IAA class have been extensively studied in dicots but little information is available on monocots. Earlier, we reported the isolation of OsiIAA1 cDNA, first monocot member of Aux/IAA gene family from rice. Extending this work further, we have isolated the OsiIAA1 gene from rice localized on chromosome 3. The transcriptional start site was mapped to 158 bp upstream to the translational start site. The increased accumulation of OsiIAA1 transcript in auxin-treated rice coleoptiles even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that OsiIAA1 is a primary auxin response gene; the expression of OsiIAA1 gene was also upregulated in the presence of cycloheximide alone. The OsiIAA1 transcript levels were down-regulated in etiolated rice coleoptiles irradiated with far-red, red and blue light, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between auxin and light signaling. The antibodies raised against His6-OsiIAA1 recombinant protein could detect the OsiIAA1 protein in the plant extract only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that OsiIAA1 is rapidly degraded by proteasome complex. The degradation of the protein was enhanced by the application of exogenous auxin. Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the purified His6-OsiIAA1 protein to some extent in the cell-free extracts of rice coleoptiles. The OsiIAA1 protein harbors two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one bipartite and the other resembling SV40 type NLS. Although both the NLSs were able to target the protein to the nucleus, the bipartite NLS was more effective. These studies indicate that nuclear localization of OsiIAA1 could be a prerequisite for its role in auxin signal transduction.

15258268	The SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 gene, required for freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, encodes a beta-glucosidase.	2004	Plant Cell	The sensitive to freezing2-1 (sfr2-1) mutation causes freezing sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. By mapping, transgenic complementation, and sequencing, sfr2-1 was revealed to be a mutation in gene At3g06510. A new knockout allele was obtained, and its identical freezing-sensitive phenotype confirmed that the SFR2 gene product is essential for freezing tolerance. Transcription of SFR2 was observed to be constitutive rather than stress inducible and was distributed throughout most aerial tissues. SFR2 encodes a protein homologous to family 1 glycosyl hydrolases (beta-glycosidases), but the predicted AtSFR2 protein is divergent from all other family 1 beta-glycosidases of Arabidopsis, showing closer homology to the sequences of several beta-glycosidases from thermophilic archea and bacteria. After purification from a heterologous expression system, AtSFR2 displayed a specific hydrolytic activity against beta-d-glucosides.
10467032	Molecular characterization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase in rice leaves.	1999	Planta	A full-length cDNA (designated rcaII) encoding the Rubisco activase (RCA) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been cloned from a cDNA library constructed with mRNA from green leaves. Sequence analysis resulted in a reading frame of 432 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.9 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 5.97. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 74-89% identity with other Rubisco activases from higher plants. Two highly conserved motifs were identified. Southern blot analysis suggested the presence of a single rca gene in the rice genome. The accumulation of leaf rca mRNA was found to be regulated by an oscillating circadian rhythm, in rice plants grown in a light-dark photoperiod. To purify the rice RCA protein, total soluble protein from rice green leaves was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. Two polypeptides, designated RCAI and RCAII, were isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and further confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The polyclonal antibodies prepared against rice RCAI and RCAII were found to cross-react with two RCA polypeptides present in leaf extracts of spinach and tobacco. Furthermore, two different 3' ends of rca mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. These cDNA fragments and the related genomic DNA fragment were cloned and sequenced. The sequence of rcaI is almost identical to the corresponding sequence of rcaII, except for its having 33 additional amino acids at the C-terminal portion. It can be concluded that a novel alternative splicing mechanism for a common rca mRNA precursor near the 3' end exists in rice plants.
10408441	Chlorophyll b and phycobilins in the common ancestor of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.	1999	Nature	Photosynthetic organisms have a variety of accessory pigments, on which their classification has been based. Despite this variation, it is generally accepted that all chloroplasts are derived from a single cyanobacterial ancestor. How the pigment diversity has arisen is the key to revealing their evolutionary history. Prochlorophytes are prokaryotes which perform oxygenic photosynthesis using chlorophyll b, like land plants and green algae (Chlorophyta), and were proposed to be the ancestors of chlorophyte chloroplasts. However, three known prochlorophytes (Prochloron didemni, Prochlorothrix hollandica and Prochlorococcus marinus) have been shown to be not the specific ancestors of chloroplasts, but only diverged members of the cyanobacteria, which contain phycobilins but lack chlorophyll b. Consequently it has been proposed that the ability to synthesize chlorophyll b developed independently several times in prochlorophytes and in the ancestor of chlorophytes. Here we have isolated the chlorophyll b synthesis genes (chlorophyll a oxygenase) from two prochlorophytes and from major groups of chlorophytes. Phylogenetic analyses show that these genes share a common evolutionary origin. This indicates that the progenitors of oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, including the ancestor of chloroplasts, had both chlorophyll b and phycobilins.
11038054	Characterization and expression of monosaccharide transporters (osMSTs) in rice.	2000	Plant Cell Physiol	This study deals with the cloning and characterization of monosaccharide transporter cDNAs in rice. OsMST1-3 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporters 1-3) have two sets of putative six transmembrane domains separated by a central long hydrophilic region. Heterologous expression of OsMST3 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that OsMST3 has transport activity for some monosaccharides in an energy-dependent H+ co-transport manner. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that OsMST3 mRNA is detectable in leaf blades, leaf sheaths, calli and roots, especially the xylem as well as in sclerenchyma cells in the root. These results suggested that OsMST3 is involved in the accumulation of monosaccharides required for cell wall synthesis at the stage of cell thickening.
9421493	Nuclear encoding of a plastid sigma factor in rice and its tissue- and light-dependent expression.	1998	Nucleic Acids Res	A full-length cDNA encoding a putative sigma factor for a plastid RNA polymerase was isolated from the higher plant Oryza sativa . The nucleotide sequence of the corresponding nuclear gene, named Os-sigA ( O.sativa sigma A), predicts a polypeptide of 519 amino acids that contains a putative plastid-targeting sequence in its N-terminal region. The predicted mature protein shows extensive sequence homology to bacterial sigma factors, encompassing the conserved regions 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3, 4.1 and 4.2 implicated in binding to -10 promoter elements, promoter melting and interaction with the core RNA polymerase enzyme. RNA blot analysis revealed that the abundance of Os-sigA transcripts was markedly greater in green shoots than in roots or in dark-grown etiolated shoots of rice seedlings. Furthermore, exposure of dark-grown etiolated seedlings to light resulted in a rapid increase in the amount of Os-sigA mRNA in the shoot. These observations suggest that regulation of expression of the nuclear gene for this putative plastid RNA polymerase sigmafactor by light contributes to light-dependent transcriptional regulation of plastid genes.
11500548	Characterization of rice anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit genes OASA1 and OASA2. Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1.	2001	Plant Physiol	Anthranilate synthase (AS) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of tryptophan (Trp), indole-3-acetic acid, and indole alkaloids. Two genes, OASA1 and OASA2, encoding AS alpha-subunits were isolated from a monocotyledonous plant, rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare), and were characterized. A phylogenetic tree of AS alpha-subunits from various species revealed a close evolutionary relationship among OASA1 and Arabidopsis ASA2, Ruta graveolens AS alpha 2, and tobacco ASA2, whereas OASA2, Arabidopsis ASA1, and R. graveolens AS alpha 1 were more distantly related. OASA1 is expressed in all tissues tested, but the amount of its mRNA was greater in panicles than in leaves and roots. The abundance of OASA2 transcripts is similar among tissues and greater than that of OASA1 transcripts; furthermore, OASA2 expression was induced by a chitin heptamer, a potent elicitor, suggesting that OASA2 participates in secondary metabolism. Expression of wild-type OASA1 or OASA2 transgenes did not affect the Trp content of rice calli or plants. However, transformed calli and plants expressing a mutated OASA1 gene, OASA1(D323N), that encodes a protein in which aspartate-323 is replaced with asparagine manifested up to 180- and 35-fold increases, respectively, in Trp accumulation. These transgenic calli and plants were resistant to 300 microM 5-methyl-Trp, and AS activity of the calli showed a markedly reduced sensitivity to Trp. These results show that OASA1 is important in the regulation of free Trp concentration, and that mutation of OASA1 to render the encoded protein insensitive to feedback inhibition results in accumulation of Trp at high levels. The OASA1(D323N) transgene may prove useful for the generation of crops with an increased Trp content.

1463854	Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage.	1992	Plant Mol Biol	A cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been constructed from anthers at an early stage of pollen development. By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots. Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation. A comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with those in data banks has not shown significant homology to known molecules.
7858214	Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage. The mRNA corresponding to each cDNA was shown to be localized only in the tapetal cells of the rice immature anthers, but not in the microspores or the mature pollen. The corresponding genomic clone, Osg6B, was isolated, and its 5'-upstream region was found to regulate beta-glucuronidase expression in the tapetum of transgenic tobacco. A set of 5' deletions was also generated and a 1095 bp 5' region was revealed to be necessary for activation of the Osg6B promoter in transgenic tobacco.
16367953	An active DNA transposon nDart causing leaf variegation and mutable dwarfism and its related elements in rice.	2006	Plant J	While characterized mutable alleles caused by DNA transposons have been abundant in maize since the discovery of Dissociation conferring variegation by Barbara McClintock, only a few mutable alleles have been described in rice even though the rice genome contains various transposons. Here, we show that a spontaneous mutable virescent allele, pyl-v, is caused by the disruption of the nuclear-coded essential chloroplast protease gene, OsClpP5, due to insertion of a 607-bp non-autonomous DNA transposon, non-autonomous DNA-based active rice transposon one (nDart1), belonging to the hAT superfamily. The transposition of nDart1 can be induced by crossing with a line containing an autonomous element, aDart, and stabilized by segregating out of aDart. We also identified a novel mutable dwarf allele thl-m caused by an insertion of nDart1. The japonica cultivar Nipponbare carries no aDart, although it contains epigenetically silenced Dart element(s), which can be activated by 5-azacytidine. Nipponbare bears four subgroups of about 3.6-kb Dart-like sequences, three of which contain potential transposase genes, and around 3.6-kb elements without an apparent transposase gene, as well as three subgroups of about 0.6-kb nDart1-related elements that are all internal deletions of the Dart-like sequences. Both nDart1 and 3.6-kb Dart-like elements were also present in indica varieties 93-11 and Kasalath. nDart1 appears to be the most active mutagen among nDart1-related elements contributing to generating natural variations. A candidate for an autonomous element, aDart, and a possible application of nDart1 for transposon tagging are discussed.
14976253	Blue light-induced transcription of plastid-encoded psbD gene is mediated by a nuclear-encoded transcription initiation factor, AtSig5.	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Light is one of the most important environmental factors regulating expression of photosynthesis genes. The plastid psbD gene encoding the photosystem II reaction center protein D2 is under the control of a unique blue light responsive promoter (BLRP) that is transcribed by a bacterial-type plastid RNA polymerase (PEP). Promoter recognition of PEP is mediated by one of the six nuclear-encoded sigma factors in Arabidopsis. The replacement of the plastid sigma factor associated with PEP may be the major mechanism for switching of plastid transcription pattern in response to environmental and developmental signals. This study demonstrates that AtSig5 is a unique sigma factor that is essential for psbD BLRP activity. A T-DNA insertional mutant with reduced AtSIG5 expression resulted in loss of primary transcripts from the psbD BLRP. Furthermore, transient overexpression of AtSig5 in dark-adapted protoplasts specifically elevated psbD and psbA transcription activities. On the other hand, overproduction of AtSig2 enhanced the transcription of psbA gene and trnE operon, but not psbD transcription. The AtSIG5 gene is phylogenetically distinct from other plastid sigma factors, and its expression is induced exclusively by blue light. We propose that AtSig5 acts as a mediator of blue light signaling that specifically activates the psbD BLRP in response to blue light in Arabidopsis.
8163192	Structural analysis of the chloroplastic and cytoplasmic aldolase-encoding genes implicated the occurrence of multiple loci in rice.	1994	Gene	The genes AldP and AldC-a, encoding the rice chloroplastic (cp) and cytoplasmic (ct) types of aldolase, respectively, were isolated and sequenced, and their transcription start points (tsp) were determined. Organization of the two genes was found to differ greatly; AldP consisted of six exons while AldC-a consisted of two exons. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of AldP contained a cp stromal targeting signal, followed by a sequence that matches the experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of mature AldP. The two enzymes share only 55% aa identity. However, rice AldP had about 73% homology with the cp aldolase of spinach. Also, the homology of AldC-a with maize, spinach and Arabidopsis thaliana cytoplasmic aldolases ranged from 70 to 90%. Southern blot analyses indicated that AldP is encoded at a single locus, whereas the gene encoding the ct counterpart is distributed at three loci on the genome. This feature is quite different from those of maize and spinach, in which only one locus was found for the ct aldolase.
16669102	Two Oryza sativa Genomic DNA Clones Encoding 16.9-Kilodalton Heat-Shock Proteins.	1992	Plant Physiol	
12242007	Characterization of DNA polymerase delta from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2002	Gene	DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), which is comprised of at least two essential subunits, is an important enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. We have cloned and characterized both the catalytic and small subunits of pol delta from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). The open reading frames of OsPoldelta1 and delta2 encoded a predicted product of 1105 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 124 kDa for OsPoldelta1, and of 429 residues with a molecular weight of 48 kDa for OsPoldelta2. Northern blotting analysis indicated that OsPoldelta1 and delta2 transcripts were expressed strongly in proliferating tissues such as shoot apical meristem. The expression patterns of both subunits in the organs were slightly different. Therefore, we analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of OsPoldelta1 transcripts by in situ hybridization. In the shoot apex, OsPoldelta1 mRNA was abundant in the shoot apical meristem. In the roots, the OsPoldelta1 transcript accumulated at high levels in the root apical meristem. In mature leaves, OsPoldelta1 was induced after UV irradiation, but OsPoldelta2 was not. The amounts of the OsPoldelta1 and delta2 mRNAs in the rice cells changed rapidly during cell proliferation. These results indicated that the levels of OsPoldelta expression are markedly correlated with cell proliferation, and that some of OsPoldelta might have special roles in the leaves.
15206945	Plant DNA polymerase lambda, a DNA repair enzyme that functions in plant meristematic and meiotic tissues.	2004	Eur J Biochem	Little is known about the functions of DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda) recently identified in mammals. From the genomic sequence information of rice and Arabidopsis, we found that Pol lambda may be the only member of the X-family in higher plants. We have succeeded in isolating the cDNA and recombinant protein of Pol lambda in a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) (OsPol lambda). OsPol lambda had activities of DNA polymerase, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase and deoxyribose phosphate lyase, a marker enzyme for base excision repair. It also interacted with rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) in a pull-down assay. OsPCNA increased the processivity of OsPol lambda. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of OsPol lambda expression correlated with cell proliferation in meristematic and meiotic tissues, and was induced by DNA-damaging treatments. These properties suggest that plant Pol lambda is a DNA repair enzyme which functions in plant meristematic and meiotic tissues, and that it can substitute for Pol beta and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase.
15965242	qUVR-10, a major quantitative trait locus for ultraviolet-B resistance in rice, encodes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase.	2005	Genetics	Rice qUVR-10, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ultraviolet-B (UVB) resistance on chromosome 10, was cloned by map-based strategy. It was detected in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare (UV resistant) and the indica variety Kasalath (UV sensitive). Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the qUVR-10 locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele. High-resolution mapping using 1850 F(2) plants enabled us to delimit qUVR-10 to a <27-kb genomic region. We identified a gene encoding the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase in this region. Activity of CPD photorepair in Nipponbare was higher than that of Kasalath and nearly isogenic with qUVR-10 [NIL(qUVR-10)], suggesting that the CPD photolyase of Kasalath was defective. We introduced a genomic fragment containing the CPD photolyase gene of Nipponbare to NIL(qUVR-10). Transgenic plants showed the same level of resistance as Nipponbare did, indicating that the qUVR-10 encoded the CPD photolyase. Comparison of the qUVR-10 sequence in the Nipponbare and Kasalath alleles revealed one probable candidate for the functional nucleotide polymorphism. It was indicated that single-base substitution in the CPD photolyase gene caused the alteration of activity of CPD photorepair and UVB resistance. Furthermore, we were able to develop a UV-hyperresistant plant by overexpression of the photolyase gene.
7551587	Purification and characterization of phospholipase D (PLD) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) and cloning of cDNA for PLD from rice and maize (Zea mays L.).	1995	Plant Cell Physiol	Phospholipase D (PLD) was purified to high homogeneity from rice bran (Oryza sativa L.). Two peaks of PLD activity were resolved by Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of PLD in both peaks was 82 kDa on SDS-PAGE and 78 kDa in gel filtration. Antibodies raised against the protein in one of the peaks precipitated the enzyme activities in both peaks. Enzymatic characteristics of PLD in the two peaks were identical except for a difference of 0.1 in the isoelectric points. Sequence analysis covering more than 10% of the amino acids of the proteins and peptide mapping did not detect any difference in the primary structure of the proteins. A cDNA for PLD was isolated from rice and it encoded a protein of 812 residues. The N-terminal sequences of purified PLDs matched the deduced amino acid sequence starting from residue 47. A Northern blot showed this gene was expressed in leaves, roots, developing seeds and cultured cells, and a Southern blot detected a single band of rice genomic DNA hybridizing to the cDNA. A cDNA for PLD was also isolated from maize. The similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences of PLD was 90% between rice and maize, 73% between the cereals and castor bean.

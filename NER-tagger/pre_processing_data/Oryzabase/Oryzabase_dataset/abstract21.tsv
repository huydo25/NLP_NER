17383991	Saturated humidity accelerates lateral root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings by increasing phloem-based auxin transport.	2007	J Exp Bot	Auxin transport plays a significant role modifying plant growth and development in response to environmental signals such as light and gravity. However, the effect of humidity on auxin transport is rarely documented. It is shown here that the transport of labelled indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) from the shoot to the root is accelerated in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cv. IR8) seedlings grown under saturated humidity (SH-seedlings) compared with plants grown under normal humidity (NH-seedlings). The development of lateral roots in SH-seedlings was greatly enhanced compared with NH-seedlings. Removal of the shoot from SH-seedlings reduced the density of lateral roots, and the application of IAA to the cut stem restored the lateral root density, while the decapitation of NH-seedlings did not alter lateral root development. Phloem-based auxin transport appeared responsible for enhanced lateral root formation in SH-seedlings since (i) the rate of IAA transport from the shoot to the root tip was greater than 3.5 cm h-1 and (ii) naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA)-induced reduction of polar auxin transport in the shoot did not influence the number of lateral roots in SH-seedlings. It is proposed that high humidity conditions accelerate the phloem-based transport of IAA from the leaf to the root, resulting in an increase in the number of lateral roots.
1392595	A novel light-regulated promoter is conserved in cereal and dicot chloroplasts.	1992	Plant Cell	The chloroplast psbD-psbC genes encode D2 and cp43, a reaction center protein and chlorophyll-binding antenna protein of photosystem II, respectively. We have previously shown that differential accumulation of light-induced psbD-psbC mRNAs in barley chloroplasts is due to transcription from a blue light-responsive promoter (LRP). It is hypothesized that the light-induced mRNAs help to maintain levels of the D2 polypeptide, which is photodamaged and degraded in illuminated plants. To determine if light-induced accumulation of psbD-psbC mRNAs was a conserved phenomenon in chloroplasts, the expression of psbD-psbC operons from five cereals (barley, wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum) and three dicot (tobacco, spinach, and pea) species was examined. Cereal and dicot psbD-psbC operons differ due to several DNA rearrangements that moved psbK-psbI proximal to psbD-psbC, allowing cotranscription of these genes and production of several unique transcripts in cereals. Despite differences in the structure and expression of the cereal and dicot psbD-psbC operons, the accumulation of light-induced psbD-psbC mRNAs was conserved in all species studied. An unusual feature of the light-induced mRNAs was the occurrence of 5' end microheterogeneity. The multiple 5' termini were mapped to several consecutive nucleotides (8 to 25 bp) within a highly conserved (61%) DNA region that represents the transcription initiation site for the mRNAs in barley and tobacco. The novel LRP differs in sequence from typical plastid promoters that have prokaryotic "-10" and "-35" elements and is centered 570 bp (cereals), 900 bp (tobacco, spinach), or 1100 bp (pea) upstream from the psbD translational start codon. We propose that physiological and gene regulatory demands of the chloroplast act as constraints that preserved the linkage of the LRP with psbD despite DNA inversions involving the psbD upstream region.
18175928	Characterization of an elicitor-induced rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY71.	2008	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Expression of OsWRKY71, a rice WRKY gene, was induced by biotic elicitors and pathogen infection. It was also found that OsWRKY71 has features characteristic of a transcriptional repressor. Microarray analysis revealed that several elicitor-induced defense-related genes were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY71. These results indicate that the activation of defense-related genes by OsWRKY71 was probably indirect.
17532485	Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53 in the expression of defense-related genes in rice.	None	Biochim Biophys Acta	We present a detailed characterization of the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-induced gene OsWRKY53. OsWRKY53 was also induced in suspension-cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. A fusion of OsWRKY53 with green fluorescent protein was detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and OsWRKY53 protein specifically bound to W-box elements. A transient assay using the particle bombardment method showed that OsWRKY53 is a transcriptional activator. A microarray analysis revealed that several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes such as PBZ1, were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing OsWRKY53. Finally, overexpression of OsWRKY53 in rice plants resulted in enhanced resistance to M. grisea. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY53 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor-induced defense signaling pathways in rice.

17555605	Highly asymmetric rice genomes.	2007	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Individuals in the same species are assumed to share the same genomic set. However, it is not unusual to find an orthologous gene only in small subset of the species, and recent genomic studies suggest that structural rearrangements are very frequent between genomes in the same species. Two recently sequenced rice genomes Oryza sativa L. var. Nipponbare and O. sativa L. var. 93-11 provide an opportunity to systematically investigate the extent of the gene repertoire polymorphism, even though the genomic data of 93-11 derived from whole-short-gun sequencing is not yet as complete as that of Nipponbare.

RESULTS: We compared gene contents and the genomic locations between two rice genomes. Our conservative estimates suggest that at least 10% of the genes in the genomes were either under presence/absence polymorphism (5.2%) or asymmetrically located between genomes (4.7%). The proportion of these "asymmetric genes" varied largely among gene groups, in which disease resistance (R) genes and the RLK kinase gene group had 11.6 and 7.8 times higher proportion of asymmetric genes than housekeeping genes (Myb and MADS). The significant difference in the proportion of asymmetric genes among gene groups suggests that natural selection is responsible for maintaining genomic asymmetry. On the other hand, the nucleotide diversity in 17 R genes under presence/absence polymorphism was generally low (average nucleotide diversity = 0.0051).

CONCLUSION: The genomic symmetry was disrupted by 10% of asymmetric genes, which could cause genetic variation through more unequal crossing over, because these genes had no allelic counterparts to pair and then they were free to pair with homologues at non-allelic loci, during meiosis in heterozygotes. It might be a consequence of diversifying selection that increased the structural divergence among genomes, and of purifying selection that decreased nucleotide divergence in each R gene locus.
18192436	Activation of the indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase GH3-8 suppresses expansin expression and promotes salicylate- and jasmonate-independent basal immunity in rice.	2008	Plant Cell	New evidence suggests a role for the plant growth hormone auxin in pathogenesis and disease resistance. Bacterial infection induces the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major type of auxin, in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA induces the expression of expansins, proteins that loosen the cell wall. Loosening the cell wall is key for plant growth but may also make the plant vulnerable to biotic intruders. Here, we report that rice GH3-8, an auxin-responsive gene functioning in auxin-dependent development, activates disease resistance in a salicylic acid signaling- and jasmonic acid signaling-independent pathway. GH3-8 encodes an IAA-amino synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation. Overexpression of GH3-8 results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. This resistance is independent of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling. Overexpression of GH3-8 also causes abnormal plant morphology and retarded growth and development. Both enhanced resistance and abnormal development may be caused by inhibition of the expression of expansins via suppressed auxin signaling.
18293011	NARROW LEAF 7 controls leaf shape mediated by auxin in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Elucidation of the genetic basis of the control of leaf shape could be of use in the manipulation of crop traits, leading to more stable and increased crop production. To improve our understanding of the process controlling leaf shape, we identified a mutant gene in rice that causes a significant decrease in the width of the leaf blade, termed narrow leaf 7 (nal7). This spontaneous mutation of nal7 occurred during the process of developing advanced back-crossed progeny derived from crosses of rice varieties with wild type leaf phenotype. While the mutation resulted in reduced leaf width, no significant morphological changes at the cellular level in leaves were observed, except in bulli-form cells. The NAL7 locus encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase, which displays sequence homology with YUCCA. Inspection of a structural model of NAL7 suggests that the mutation results in an inactive enzyme. The IAA content in the nal7 mutant was altered compared with that of wild type. The nal7 mutant overexpressing NAL7 cDNA exhibited overgrowth and abnormal morphology of the root, which was likely to be due to auxin overproduction. These results indicate that NAL7 is involved in auxin biosynthesis.
18719107	Molecular identification of a major quantitative trait locus, qLTG3-1, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice.	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Tolerance to abiotic stress is an important agronomic trait in crops and is controlled by many genes, which are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Identification of these QTLs will contribute not only to the understanding of plant biology but also for plant breeding, to achieve stable crop production around the world. Previously, we mapped three QTLs controlling low-temperature tolerance at the germination stage (called low-temperature germinability). To understand the molecular basis of one of these QTLs, qLTG3-1 (quantitative trait locus for low-temperature germinability on chromosome 3), map-based cloning was performed, and this QTL was shown to be encoded by a protein of unknown function. The QTL qLTG3-1 is strongly expressed in the embryo during seed germination. Before and during seed germination, specific localization of beta-glucuronidase staining in the tissues covering the embryo, which involved the epiblast covering the coleoptile and the aleurone layer of the seed coat, was observed. Expression of qLTG3-1 was tightly associated with vacuolation of the tissues covering the embryo. This may cause tissue weakening, resulting in reduction of the mechanical resistance to the growth potential of the coleoptile. These phenomena are quite similar to the model system of seed germination presented by dicot plants, suggesting that this model may be conserved in both dicot and monocot plants.
18365248	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase gene OsTPP1 confers stress tolerance in rice and results in the activation of stress responsive genes.	2008	Planta	Trehalose plays a protective role in yeast and microorganisms under abiotic stresses. However, little is known about its role in higher plants when subjected to environmental challenges. A systematic search of rice databases discovered a large TPS/TPP gene family in the rice genome, which is similar to that found in Arabidopsis thaliana, especially in the gene family structure. Expression analysis demonstrated that OsTPP1 was initially and transiently up-regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments but slowly up-regulated under cold stress. OsTPP1 overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress. Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that OsTPP1 triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by OsTPP1. The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and also suggested the use of OsTPP1 in abiotic stress engineering of crops.
21665625	A phylogeny of the rice tribe Oryzeae (Poaceae) based on matK sequence data.	2002	Am J Bot	Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast gene matK for 26 species representing 11 genera of the tribe Oryzeae and three outgroup species. The sequenced fragments varied from 1522 base pairs (bp) to 1534 bp in length with 15.4% variable and 7.9% phylogenetically informative sites when the outgroups were excluded. The aligned sequences were analyzed by maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. Analyses of the sequence data indicated that species of Oryzeae form a strongly supported monophyletic group, concordant with previous morphological and anatomical evidence. The tribe Oryzeae can be divided into two monophyletic lineages, corresponding to the traditionally recognized subtribes Oryzinae and Zizaniinae. The first subtribe consists of Oryza and Leersia, while the subtribe Zizaniinae includes the remaining genera. The matK sequence data did not support the close affinities of the monoecious genera in Oryzeae, implying the possibility of multiple origins of the floral structures in the tribe. It is noteworthy that Porteresia coarctata is closely related to Oryza species, suggesting that it should be treated as a member in the genus Oryza rather than a separate monotypic genus.
18395997	Expression analysis of the calcineurin B-like gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under environmental stresses.	2008	Gene	Calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in mediating various defense responses under environmental stresses. Calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins have been implicated as important Ca2+ sensors in plant-specific calcium signaling. Based on the similarity of sequence, ten CBL genes were identified by searching the rice japonica genome database, which were randomly distribute on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 12. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach the expression pattern of each gene was detected in various organs at the adult stage and seedlings treated with NaCl, PEG and cold stresses or exogenous ABA. The results showed that the induction of each rice CBL gene was not only responsive to different stress conditions, but also organ specific. In vivo targeting experiment revealed that OsCBL8 localized to the plasma membrane, which was consistent with OsCBL4 and SOS3 previously reported. To elucidate the putative function of OsCBL8 gene, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsCBL8 gene were generated by the Agrobacterium-mediated approach. The OsCBL8 transgenic rice seedlings showed more tolerance to salt stress than non-transgenic seedlings.
12764611	A gene for a Class II DNA photolyase from Oryza sativa: cloning of the cDNA by dilution-amplification.	2003	Mol Genet Genomics	Ultraviolet radiation induces the formation of two classes of photoproducts in DNA-the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and the pyrimidine [6-4] pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4 product). Many organisms produce enzymes, termed photolyases, which specifically bind to these lesions and split them via a UV-A/blue light-dependent mechanism, thereby reversing the damage. These photolyases are specific for either CPDs or 6-4 products. Two classes of photolyases (class I and class II) repair CPDs. A gene that encodes a protein with class II CPD photolyase activity in vitro has been cloned from several plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Cucumis sativus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We report here the isolation of a homolog of this gene from rice (Oryza sativa), which was cloned on the basis of sequence similarity and PCR-based dilution-amplification. The cDNA comprises a very GC-rich (75%) 5; region, while the 3; portion has a GC content of 50%. This gene encodes a protein with CPD photolyase activity when expressed in E. coli. The CPD photolyase gene encodes at least two types of mRNA, formed by alternative splicing of exon 5. One of the mRNAs encodes an ORF for 506 amino acid residues, while the other is predicted to code for 364 amino acid residues. The two RNAs occur in about equal amounts in O. sativa cells.
8589847	Phylogeny of the Coleoptera based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence data.	1995	Insect Mol Biol	A 400 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was sequenced for thirty-seven species of beetle, representing fifteen families. The sequence was found to be highly variable, with 12-18% divergence within families, and up to 27% divergence between families. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour-joining method shows the Carabidae (Adephaga) as a distinct clade, but also shows that all other beetles (Polyphaga) diverged soon after the Adephaga/Polyphaga split. Whilst some species are grouped within their respective families, others are too diverged for easy resolution. The main disagreement with trees constructed using comparative morphology and the fossil record is the position of the Coccinellidae. Whilst COI may be an informative gene for molecular systematics at lower taxonomic levels, or in other insects, improved resolution of this particular phylogeny will require a more highly conserved sequence.
18622033	Molecular evolution of the Pi-ta gene resistant to rice blast in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon).	2008	Genetics	Rice blast disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita. The genotype variation and resistant/susceptible phenotype at the Pi-ta locus of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the ancestor of cultivated rice (O. sativa), was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the Pi-ta gene. The low nucleotide polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene of O. rufipogon was similar to that of O. sativa, but greatly differed from what has been reported for other O. rufipogon genes. The haplotypes can be subdivided into two divergent haplogroups named H1 and H2. H1 is derived from H2, with nearly no variation and at a low frequency. H2 is common and is the ancestral form. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain has a high pi(non)/pi(syn) ratio, and the low polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene might have primarily been caused by recurrent selective sweep and constraint by other putative physiological functions. Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the amino acid Ala-918 of H1 in the LRR domain has a close relationship with the resistant phenotype. H1 might have recently arisen during rice domestication and may be associated with the scenario of a blast pathogen-host shift from Italian millet to rice.
18588956	Expression analysis of rice A20/AN1-type zinc finger genes and characterization of ZFP177 that contributes to temperature stress tolerance.	2008	Gene	The A20/AN1-type zinc finger protein family is conserved in animals and plants. Using human AWP1 protein as a query, we identified twelve A20/AN1-type zinc finger proteins in japonica rice. Most of these genes were constitutively expressed in leaves, roots, culms and spikes. Through microarray analysis, it was found that four genes (ZFP177, ZFP181, ZFP176, ZFP173), two genes (ZFP181 and ZFP176) and one gene (ZFP157) were significantly induced by cold, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments, respectively. Further expression analysis showed that ZFP177 was responsive to both cold and heat stresses, but down-regulated by salt. The subcellular localization assay indicated that ZFP177 was localized in cytoplasm in tobacco leaf and root cells. Yeast-one hybrid assay showed that ZFP177 lacked trans-activation potential in yeast cells. Overexpression of ZFP177 in tobacco conferred tolerance of transgenic plants to both low and high temperature stresses, but increased sensitivity to salt and drought stresses. Further we found expression levels of some stress-related genes were inhibited in ZFP177 transgenic plants. These results suggested that ZFP177 might play crucial but differential roles in plant responses to various abiotic stresses.
17434609	A novel rice C2H2-type zinc finger protein lacking DLN-box/EAR-motif plays a role in salt tolerance.	2007	Biochim Biophys Acta	A cDNA for the gene ZFP182, encoding a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, was cloned from rice by RT-PCR. ZFP182 codes an 18.2 kDa protein with two C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, one nuclear localization signal and one Leu-rich domain. The DLN-box/EAR-motif, which exists in most of plant C2H2-type zinc finger proteins, does not exist in ZFP182. The expression analysis showed that ZFP182 gene was constitutively expressed in leaves, culms, roots and spikes at the adult rice plants, and markedly induced in the seedlings by cold (4 degrees C), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM ABA treatments. The approximate 1.4 kb promoter region of ZFP182 gene was fused into GUS reporter gene and transformed into tobacco. The histochemical analysis revealed that GUS expression could not be detected in transformed tobacco seedlings under normal conditions, but strongly observed in tobacco leaf discs and the vascular tissue of roots treated with NaCl or KCl. Expression of ZFP182 in transgenic tobacco and overexpression in rice increased plant tolerance to salt stress. These results demonstrated that ZFP182 might be involved in plant responses to salt stress.
18054244	Increased expression of the rice C-type cyclin-dependent protein kinase gene, Orysa;CDKC;1, in response to salt stress.	2008	Plant Physiol Biochem	Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) form a conserved superfamily of eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinases which require binding to a regulatory cyclin for activity. CDKs are organized in several gene families and are involved in different aspects of cell biology, such as gene transcription, cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we present the characteristics of the rice C-type CDK gene, Orysa;CDKC;1. The gene was expressed in all organs of the plant and relatively high amounts of its transcript were detected in mature leaves and panicles. This indicated a putative role during later stages of leaf and panicle development. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified Orysa;CYCT as an interactor with Orysa;CDKC;1. The expression profiles of the new Orysa;CDKC;1 in response to various factors from rice cells were compared with those of previously described Orysa;CDKA;1, and Orysa;CDKB2;1. The Orysa;CDKC;1 transcript was induced by salt stress and ABA treatments, but was unaffected by mannitol. In addition, the MBP kinase activity associated with Orysa;CDKC;1 immunocomplexes was induced under salt stress. We propose that Orysa;CDKC;1 may be involved in developmental programs, as well as in the salt- and ABA-signaling pathway.

17415667	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression.	2007	Biotechnol Lett	A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase cDNA was cloned from the rice, Oryza sativa. The cDNA encoding O. sativa acid phosphatase (OsACP1) has 1100 bp with an open reading frame of 274 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsACP1 cDNA showed 53% identity to tomato acid phosphatase and 46-50% identity to several other plant phosphatases. OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi). The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients. OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root. The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells. In addition, the OsACP1 gene was introduced into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Functional expression of the OsACP1 gene in the transgenic Arabidopsis lines was confirmed by Northern blot and Western blot analyses, as well as phosphatase activity assays. These results suggest that the OsACP1 gene can be used to develop new transgenic dicotyledonous plants able to adapt to Pi-deficient conditions.
17666027	Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate.	2007	Plant J	Inflorescence architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits. Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1) mutants revealed that APO1 positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems. In addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy. Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes. Molecular studies revealed that APO1 encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes. Overexpression of APO1 caused an increase in inflorescence branches and spikelets. As the mutant inflorescences and flowers differed considerably between apo1 and ufo, the functions of APO1 and UFO appear to have diverged during evolution.
17531407	Characterization of a multifunctional inositol phosphate kinase from rice and barley belonging to the ATP-grasp superfamily.	2007	Gene	OsIpk and HvIpk, inositol phosphate kinases, were cloned from rice (Oryza sativa L. var. indica, IR64) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) respectively. Sequence alignment showed that they belong to the ATP-grasp family, which includes inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase from humans and Arabidopsis. Residues that are binding sites for ATP and coordinate magnesium in absence or presence of inositol phosphate are conserved and in total 23 residues are invariant among the twelve aligned inositol phosphate kinases. The genes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and kinase activity assays with 17 different isomers of inositol mono-/di-/tri-/tetra-/pentaphosphate as well as phytate were performed. The strongest activity for both kinases was observed with Ins(3,4,5,6)P(4), which candidates as the primary substrate for these kinases in plants. Several species-specific differences between the two recombinant Ipks were observed. Rice OsIpk showed detectable kinase activity towards eight different substrates, whereas barley HvIpk showed kinase activity with all the substrates including inositol mono- and bisphosphates. HvIpk showed 3-kinase activity towards the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) substrate and it also interconverted the two substrates Ins(1,3,4,5)P(4) and Ins(1,3,4,6)P(4) by isomerase activity, which was not observed for the rice homologue. Both OsIpk and HvIpk had no detectable 2-kinase activity. Furthermore, the two Ipks showed phosphatase activity towards several inositol phosphates. Expression analysis by RT-PCR demonstrated that the Ipk gene was equally expressed in different tissues and developmental stages. Taken together, these results show that the Ipk kinase plays a significant role in the inositol phosphate interacting network in plants.

1282087	Structure and expression of the rice mitochondrial apocytochrome b gene (cob-1) and pseudogene (cob-2).	1992	Curr Genet	Rice mitochondrial DNA contains an intact copy and a pseudogene copy of a apocytochrome b gene (cob-1 and cob-2, respectively). Using primer extension and capping analyses, the transcriptional start site has been mapped; an 11-base motif at the transcription start site closely matches the consensus promoter motifs proposed for maize, wheat and soybean mitochondrial genes. Although both copies are identical in the 5' upstream region and through most of the coding region, only cob-1-specific mRNA is detected on RNA gel-blots. Run-on transcription analysis indicates, however, that both cob-1 and cob-2 mRNAs are synthesized in vivo but less cob-2 is accumulated. At its mapped 3' terminus the cob-1 transcript possesses a sequence that could fold into a double stem-loop structure. The possible roles of a double stem-loop structure in mitochondrial gene expression are discussed.
17376611	Characterization of a lipoate-protein ligase A gene of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Gene	Lipoic acid is an essential disulfide cofactor required for the lipoate-dependent enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and glycine cleavage enzymes that function in key metabolic pathways in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Lipoic acid is covalently bound to lipoate-dependent enzymes by lipoate-protein ligase or lipoate transferase. Here, we characterized a lipoyl-protein ligase A (OsLPLA) gene of rice. The OsLPLA gene, which encoded 270 amino acids, was located on an approximately 21 Mb of chromosome 8 on the physical map of Oryza sativa Japonica type. OsLPLA transcripts were abundantly expressed in leaves and developing seeds. The OsLPLA gene functionally complemented an Escherichia coli lplA null mutant. Furthermore, the protein expressed from the OsLPLA gene in an E. coli lplA mutant successfully transferred exogenous lipoate to lipoate-dependent enzymes, including the E2 subunits of the PDH, the E2 subunit of KGDH and the H-protein of glycine decarboxylase, confirming that rice OsLPLA successfully catalyzed covalent attachment of lipoate onto lipoate-dependent enzymes.
18205020	Overexpression of OsiSAP8, a member of stress associated protein (SAP) gene family of rice confers tolerance to salt, drought and cold stress in transgenic tobacco and rice.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	We describe here the isolation and characterization of OsiSAP8, a member of stress Associated protein (SAP) gene family from rice characterized by the presence of A20 and AN1 type Zinc finger domains. OsiSAP8 is a multiple stress inducible gene, induced by various stresses, namely heat, cold, salt, desiccation, submergence, wounding, heavy metals as well as stress hormone Abscisic acid. OsiSAP8 protein fused to GFP was localized towards the periphery of the cells in the epidermal cells of infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Yeast two hybrid analysis revealed that A20 and AN1 type zinc-finger domains of OsiSAP8 interact with each other. Overexpression of the gene in both transgenic tobacco and rice conferred tolerance to salt, drought and cold stress at seed germination/seedling stage as reflected by percentage of germination and gain in fresh weight after stress recovery. Transgenic rice plants were tolerant to salt and drought during anthesis stage without any yield penalty as compared to unstressed transgenic plants.
1588598	Genetic code and phylogenetic origin of oomycetous mitochondria.	1992	J Mol Evol	We sequenced the 3'-terminal part of the COX3 gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 from mitochondria of Phytophthora parasitica (phylum Oomycota, kingdom Protoctista). Comparison of the sequence with known COX3 genes revealed that UGG is used as a tryptophan codon in contrast to UGA in the mitochondrial codes of most organisms other than green plants. A very high AT mutation pressure operates on the mitochondrial genome of Phytophthora, as revealed by codon usage and by A+T content of noncoding regions, which seems paradoxical because AT pressure causes tryptophan codon reassignment from UGG to UGA in mitochondria of most species. The genetic code and other data suggest that mitochondria of Oomycota share a direct common ancestor with mitochondria of plants and that mitochondria of the ancestor of Planta and Oomycota were acquired in a second endosymbiotic event, which occurred later than the acquisition of mitochondria by other eukaryotes.
8675024	Gene organization in the ada-rplL region of Streptomyces virginiae.	1996	Gene	The gene organization of a 7.4-kb region of the Streptomyces virginiae (Sv) chromosome was determined. The predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and their predicted products, in sequence order, were (i) ada, encoding adenosine deaminase [EC 3.5.4.4], (ii) aat, encoding a protein homologous to aspartate aminotransferase [EC 2.6.1.1], (iii) secE, encoding a protein involved in protein secretion, (iv) vbrA, encoding a NusG-like protein involved in antitermination of transcription as described by Okamoto et al. [J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 1093-1098], and (v) rplKAJL, encoding the large subunits of the ribosomal proteins L11, L1, L10 and L12. Six of the ORFs (secE-rplL) were oriented in the same direction, but the other two (ada and aat) had the opposite orientation. The gene organization of the secE-rplL region in Sv was identical to that in Escherichia coli.
17991631	Gain-of-function phenotypes of chemically synthetic CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Using 26 chemically synthetic CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE) peptides, which correspond to the predicted products of the 31 Arabidopsis CLE genes, we investigated the CLE peptide function in Arabidopsis and rice. Treatment with some CLE peptides inhibited root elongation in rice as well as in Arabidopsis. It also reduced the size of the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis but not in rice. Database searches revealed 47 putative CLE genes in the rice genome and multiple CLE domains in some CLE genes, indicating diverse CLE function in these plants.
8806415	A ribosomal protein L2 gene is transcribed, spliced, and edited at one site in rice mitochondria.	1996	Plant Mol Biol	The mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 gene (rpl2) is coded by two exons of 840 and 669 bp separated by an intron sequence of 1481 bp in the rice mitochondrial genome. The rpl2 gene is located three nucleotides upstream of the ribosomal protein S19 gene (rps19) and both genes are co-transcribed. cDNA sequence analysis identified splicing of the intron sequence from the rpl2 mRNA as well as RNA editing events. The deduced secondary structure of the rpl2 intron sequence shows the characteristic features of a group-II intron. A single RNA editing site is identified in rpl2 and six editing sites in rps19 transcripts. In addition, one editing site is observed in the 3 nucleotide intergenic region. Analysis of individual cDNA clones showed a different extent of RNA editing. The rice rpl2 intron is located at a different site and shows no significant nucleotide sequence similarity with the rpl2 intron of liverwort. However, 60% nucleotide sequence identity is observed between the rice rpl2 intron and the Oenothera nad5 intron in a 234 nucleotide region. The mitochondrial rpl2 sequence is absent from the pea mitochondrial genome and we consequently propose that the mitochondrial RPL2 protein is encoded by a nuclear gene in pea.
17416733	Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence.	2007	Plant Cell	Chlorophyll degradation is an aspect of leaf senescence, which is an active process to salvage nutrients from old tissues. non-yellow coloring1 (nyc1) is a rice (Oryza sativa) stay-green mutant in which chlorophyll degradation during senescence is impaired. Pigment analysis revealed that degradation of not only chlorophylls but also light-harvesting complex II (LHCII)-bound carotenoids was repressed in nyc1, in which most LHCII isoforms were selectively retained during senescence. Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes. Map-based cloning of NYC1 revealed that it encodes a chloroplast-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains. The predicted structure of the NYC1 protein and the phenotype of the nyc1 mutant suggest the possibility that NYC1 is a chlorophyll b reductase. Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro. We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions. Our data collectively suggest that the identified SDR protein NYC1 plays essential roles in the regulation of LHCII and thylakoid membrane degradation during senescence.
17852346	Characterization of phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis protein class F gene in rice.	2008	DNA Seq	The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are linked to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GAPs) which are essential for the growth of mammalian, yeast and protozoan cells. The GPI anchor is covalently linked to GAP by amide bond formation between the carboxyl terminus and phosphoethanolamine attached at the third mannose and mediated by a transamidase complex. Mediation of GPI synthesis is by the sequential additions of GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex, the GlcN-PI de-N-acetylase, the GlcN-PI mannosyltransferases and the GPI lipid anchor phosphoethanolamine transferase complexes. We report a rice gene OsPIG-F that encodes a homolog to the human PIG-F protein, one of GPI lipid anchor phosphoethanolamine transferase complexes. The amino acid sequences of rice PIG-F consisted of six helix transmembrane domains, one glycosaminoglycan attachment site, one cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and a protein C phosphorylation site at the C-terminus. This unique structure of rice PIG-F indicates the typical membrane bound structure of a protein. Polyclonal antibody for rice PIG-F was found to be cross-reactive with a protein extracted from the leaves of rice. The levels of rice PIG-F transcripts were found to be abundant in leaves, moderately in the milky stage of seed development and less in the floral spikelet, indicating that the rice PIG-F gene was differentially regulated in specific tissues. Furthermore, the levels of rice PIG-F transcription were up-regulated by growth hormones including GA(3), NAA and kinetin. These results indicated that the rice PIG-F gene expression may medicated by these growth regulators.
16792693	Cloning of two splice variants of the rice PTS1 receptor, OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS, and their functional characterization using pex5-deficient yeast and Arabidopsis.	2006	Plant J	Using the rice PEX14 cDNA as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, two splice variants of the type I peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) receptor, OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS, were cloned from a pathogen-treated rice leaf cDNA library. The proteins were produced from a single gene by alternative splicing, which generated a full-length variant, OsPEX5L, and a variant that lacked exon 7, OsPEX5S. OsPex5pL contained 11 copies of the pentapeptide motif WXXXF/Y in its N-terminus, and seven tetratricopeptide repeats in its C-terminus. Expression of OsPEX5L and OsPEX5S predominantly occurred in leaf tissues, and was induced by various stresses, such as exposure to the pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and treatment with fungal elicitor, methyl viologen, NaCl or hydrogen peroxide. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional pex5 mutant, Atpex5, which does not germinate in the absence of sucrose and was resistant to indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), was perfectly rescued by over-expression of OsPex5pL, but not by OsPex5pS. Using transient expression of OsPex5pL and OsPex5pS in the Atpex5 mutant, we show that OsPex5pL translocates both PTS1- and PTS2-containing proteins into the peroxisome by interacting with OsPex7p, whereas OsPex5pS is involved only in PTS1-dependent import in Arabidopsis.
18162592	PSY3, a new member of the phytoene synthase gene family conserved in the Poaceae and regulator of abiotic stress-induced root carotenogenesis.	2008	Plant Physiol	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a vital role in mediating abiotic stress responses in plants. De novo ABA biosynthesis involves cleavage of carotenoid precursors by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which is rate controlling in leaves and roots; however, additional bottlenecks in roots must be overcome, such as biosynthesis of upstream carotenoid precursors. Phytoene synthase (PSY) mediates the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis; with PSY3 described here, maize (Zea mays) and other members of the Poaceae have three paralogous genes, in contrast to only one in Arabidopsis thaliana. PSY gene duplication has led to subfunctionalization, with each paralog exhibiting differential gene expression. We showed that PSY3 encodes a functional enzyme for which maize transcript levels are regulated in response to abiotic stresses, drought, salt, and ABA. Drought-stressed roots showed elevated PSY3 transcripts and ABA, responses reversed by rehydration. By blocking root carotenoid biosynthesis with the maize y9 mutation, we demonstrated that PSY3 mRNA elevation correlates with carotenoid accumulation and that blocking carotenoid biosynthesis interferes with stress-induced ABA accumulation. In parallel, we observed elevated NCED transcripts and showed that, in contrast to dicots, root zeaxanthin epoxidase transcripts were unchanged. PSY3 was the only paralog for which transcripts were induced in roots and abiotic stress also affected leaf PSY2 transcript levels; PSY1 mRNA was not elevated in any tissues tested. Our results suggest that PSY3 expression influences root carotenogenesis and defines a potential bottleneck upstream of NCED; further examination of PSY3 in the grasses is of value for better understanding root-specific stress responses that impact plant yield.
17947408	The blast resistance gene Pi37 encodes a nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a resistance gene cluster on rice chromosome 1.	2007	Genetics	The resistance (R) gene Pi37, present in the rice cultivar St. No. 1, was isolated by an in silico map-based cloning procedure. The equivalent genetic region in Nipponbare contains four nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type loci. These four candidates for Pi37 (Pi37-1, -2, -3, and -4) were amplified separately from St. No. 1 via long-range PCR, and cloned into a binary vector. Each construct was individually transformed into the highly blast susceptible cultivar Q1063. The subsequent complementation analysis revealed Pi37-3 to be the functional gene, while -1, -2, and -4 are probably pseudogenes. Pi37 encodes a 1290 peptide NBS-LRR product, and the presence of substitutions at two sites in the NBS region (V239A and I247M) is associated with the resistance phenotype. Semiquantitative expression analysis showed that in St. No. 1, Pi37 was constitutively expressed and only slightly induced by blast infection. Transient expression experiments indicated that the Pi37 product is restricted to the cytoplasm. Pi37-3 is thought to have evolved recently from -2, which in turn was derived from an ancestral -1 sequence. Pi37-4 is likely the most recently evolved member of the cluster and probably represents a duplication of -3. The four Pi37 paralogs are more closely related to maize rp1 than to any of the currently isolated rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, Pi2, Piz-t, and Pi36.
1617739	Co-transcription of orf25 and coxIII in rice mitochondria.	1992	Curr Genet	Southern hybridization analysis using homologous maize probes indicated that orf25 and coxIII are closely linked in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar IR36. The two coding regions were found on the same 5.1 kb BamHI fragment, and this fragment was cloned, mapped and partially sequenced. Using probes for each gene derived from the rice clone, a 2.4 kb dicistronic mRNA transcript was found containing both orf25 and coxIII coding regions. Multiple 5' ends were identified by primer extension analysis and a double stem/loop structure was mapped to the 3' end. The orf25 coding region shares greater than 85% identity with orf25 sequences from maize, tobacco and wheat, suggesting that orf25 may code for a conserved protein product.
17905898	Oryza sativa dicer-like4 reveals a key role for small interfering RNA silencing in plant development.	2007	Plant Cell	MicroRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two classes of small regulatory RNAs derived from different types of precursors and processed by distinct Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) proteins. During evolution, four Arabidopsis thaliana DCLs and six rice (Oryza sativa) DCLs (Os DCLs) appear to have acquired specialized functions. The Arabidopsis DCLs are well characterized, but those in rice remain largely unstudied. Here, we show that both knockdown and loss of function of rice DCL4, the homolog of Arabidopsis DCL4, lead to vegetative growth abnormalities and severe developmental defects in spikelet identity. These phenotypic alterations appear to be distinct from those observed in Arabidopsis dcl4 mutants, which exhibit accelerated vegetative phase change. The difference in phenotype between rice and Arabidopsis dcl4 mutants suggests that siRNA processing by DCL4 has a broader role in rice development than in Arabidopsis. Biochemical and genetic analyses indicate that Os DCL4 is the major Dicer responsible for the 21-nucleotide siRNAs associated with inverted repeat transgenes and for trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) from the endogenous TRANS-ACTING siRNA3 (TAS3) gene. We show that the biogenesis mechanism of TAS3 ta-siRNA is conserved but that putative direct targets of Os DCL4 appear to be differentially regulated between monocots and dicots. Our results reveal a critical role of Os DCL4-mediated ta-siRNA biogenesis in rice development.
18037265	Case study for identification of potentially indel-caused alternative expression isoforms in the rice subspecies japonica and indica by integrative genome analysis.	2008	Genomics	Alternative splicing (AS) is one of the most significant components of the functional complexity of the eukaryote genome, increasing protein diversity, creating isoforms, and affecting mRNA stability. Recently, whole genome sequences and large microarray data sets have become available, making data integration feasible and allowing the study of the possible regulatory mechanism of AS in rice (Oryza sativa) by erecting and testing hypotheses before doing bench studies. We have developed a new strategy and have identified 215 rice genes with alternative expression isoforms related to insertion and deletion (indel) between subspecies indica and subspecies japonica. We did a case study for alternative expression isoforms of the rice peroxidase gene LOC_Os06g48030 to investigate possible mechanisms by which indels caused alternative splicing between the indica and the japonica varieties by mining of array data together with validation by RT-PCR and genome sequencing analysis. Multiple poly(A) signals were detected in the specific indel region for LOC_Os06g48030. We present a new methodology to promote more discoveries of potentially indel-caused AS genes in rice, which may serve as the foundation for research into the regulatory mechanism of alternative expression isoforms between subspecies.
16919842	OsWRKY71, a rice transcription factor, is involved in rice defense response.	2007	J Plant Physiol	WRKY proteins are a large family of transcription factors that mainly participate in plant biotic stress responses. So far, one hundred and five OsWRKY genes have been predicted in the rice genome. To identify OsWRKY genes that might function in inducible defense responses, a phylogenetic tree including 184 WRKY proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and other species was constructed. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, ten candidate OsWRKY genes that may be involved in defense responses were isolated from salicylic acid (SA)-treated rice seedlings. One of them, OsWRKY71, was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response. Transient expression of OsWRKY71:GFP fusion protein in onion epidermis cells revealed that OsWRKY71 was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsWRKY71 gene in rice resulted in enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) 13751. Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, OsNPR1 and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants. These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of OsNPR1 and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways.
17507669	The in silico map-based cloning of Pi36, a rice coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat gene that confers race-specific resistance to the blast fungus.	2007	Genetics	The indica rice variety Kasalath carries Pi36, a gene that determines resistance to Chinese isolates of rice blast and that has been located to a 17-kb interval on chromosome 8. The genomic sequence of the reference japonica variety Nipponbare was used for an in silico prediction of the resistance (R) gene content of the interval and hence for the identification of candidate gene(s) for Pi36. Three such sequences, which all had both a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat motif, were present. The three candidate genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of a number of varieties by long-range PCR, and the resulting amplicons were inserted into pCAMBIA1300 and/or pYLTAC27 vectors to determine sequence polymorphisms correlated to the resistance phenotype and to perform transgenic complementation tests. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into the blast-susceptible variety Q1063, which allowed the identification of Pi36-3 as the functional gene, with the other two candidates being probable pseudogenes. The Pi36-encoded protein is composed of 1056 amino acids, with a single substitution event (Asp to Ser) at residue 590 associated with the resistant phenotype. Pi36 is a single-copy gene in rice and is more closely related to the barley powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1 and Mla6 than to the rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, and Piz-t. An RT-PCR analysis showed that Pi36 is constitutively expressed in Kasalath.
17999149	Construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) for map-based cloning of genes selected during the domestication of rice.	2008	Biotechnol Lett	As a prerequisite for the map-based cloning of genes from common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.), which plays an important role in the domestication of cultivated rice (O. sativa L.), we constructed a median-insert size bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of the common wild rice isolate, YJCWR, collected from Yuanjiang, Yunnan Province, China. The library consists of 52,992 clones, with an average insert size of 50 kb, and all clones were pooled into 46 three-dimensional super-pools to facilitate library screening through the PCR method. Seventeen candidate clones were isolated by five markers and some clones containing putative target regions were sequenced. Furthermore, in analyzing the sequences of YJCWR, a retrotransposon, SZ-55, that might contribute to the evolution of Oryza was found.
16766658	Phylogeography of Asian wild rice, Oryza rufipogon, reveals multiple independent domestications of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa.	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L., represents the world's most important staple food crop, feeding more than half of the human population. Despite this essential role in world agriculture, the history of cultivated rice's domestication from its wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon, remains unclear. In this study, DNA sequence variation in three gene regions is examined in a phylogeographic approach to investigate the domestication of cultivated rice. Results indicate that India and Indochina may represent the ancestral center of diversity for O. rufipogon. Additionally, the data suggest that cultivated rice was domesticated at least twice from different O. rufipogon populations and that the products of these two independent domestication events are the two major rice varieties, Oryza sativa indica and Oryza sativa japonica. Based on this geographical analysis, O. sativa indica was domesticated within a region south of the Himalaya mountain range, likely eastern India, Myanmar, and Thailand, whereas O. sativa japonica was domesticated from wild rice in southern China.
17625566	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice.	2007	Nature	Silicon is an important nutrient for the optimal growth and sustainable production of rice. Rice accumulates up to 10% silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.
15653800	Isolation and identification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored arabinogalactan proteins and novel beta-glucosyl Yariv-reactive proteins from seeds of rice (Oryza sativa).	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are highly glycosylated extracellular glycoproteins playing important roles in plant growth and development. We have previously reported the possibility that AGPs are involved in the induction of alpha-amylase by gibberellin (GA) in barley aleurone layers by using the beta-glucosyl Yariv reagent (beta-GlcY), which has been presumed to specifically bind AGPs. In this present study, we isolated beta-GlcY-reactive proteins from rice bran rich in aleurone cells. The N-terminal sequences of classical AGP and AG peptides were determined from hydrophilic fractions obtained by reversed phase HPLC. Interestingly, a novel non-specific lipid transfer protein-like protein (OsLTPL1) and a novel early nodulin-like protein (OsENODL1) were also identified in the more hydrophobic fractions from HPLC as beta-GlcY-reactive proteins. Expression analysis of the genes coding for these proteins was performed. While classical AGP, AG peptides and OsLTPL1 were expressed in various parts of rice, OsENODL1 showed temporally and spatially specific expression in the aleurone layers. This new beta-GlcY-reactive protein is a promising candidate for the extracellular signaling factors of GA action in cereal seeds. Furthermore, the possibility that proteins with the AG glycomodule might react with beta-GlcY may broaden the definition of AGPs.
17947413	The extent of linkage disequilibrium in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	Genetics	Despite its status as one of the world's major crops, linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns have not been systematically characterized across the genome of Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Such information is critical to fully exploit the genome sequence for mapping complex traits using association techniques. Here we characterize LD in five 500-kb regions of the rice genome in three major cultivated rice varieties (indica, tropical japonica, and temperate japonica) and in the wild ancestor of Asian rice, Oryza rufipogon. Using unlinked SNPs to determine the amount of background linkage disequilibrium in each population, we find that the extent of LD is greatest in temperate japonica (probably >500 kb), followed by tropical japonica (approximately 150 kb) and indica (approximately 75 kb). LD extends over a shorter distance in O. rufipogon (<40 kb) than in any of the O. sativa groups assayed here. The differences in the extent of LD among these groups are consistent with differences in outcrossing and recombination rate estimates. As well as heterogeneity between groups, our results suggest variation in LD patterns among genomic regions. We demonstrate the feasibility of genomewide association mapping in cultivated Asian rice using a modest number of SNPs.
18305920	Allelic diversification at the wx locus in landraces of Asian rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	To examine continuous variation of amylose levels in Asian rice (Oryza sativa) landraces, the five putative alleles (Wx a, Wx in, Wx b, Wx op, and wx) at the wx locus were investigated in near-isogenic lines (NILs). Apparent amylose levels ranged from 0.5 to 29.9% in the NILs, showing a positive relation with the levels of Wx gene product, granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) as well as the enzymatic activity per milligram starch granule. Only opaque (Wx op) accessions had an enzymatic activity per GBSS that was reduced to half the level of the others. Nucleotide sequences in the Wx gene were compared among 18 accessions harboring the five different alleles. Each of the Wx alleles had a unique replacement, frame-shift or splice donor site mutation, suggesting that these nucleotide changes could be reflected in phenotype alterations. A molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using the Wx gene indicated that ssp. japonica forms a distinct clade, whereas ssp. indica forms different clades together with the wild progenitor. Unexpectedly, the wx allele of 160 (indica from Taiwan) joined the japonica lineage; however, comparisons using linked genes for two Taiwanese accessions revealed that the wx gene was the product of gene flow from japonica to indica. Therefore, the japonica lineage frequently included Wx in, Wx b and wx, while Wx a and Wx op were found in the other lineages, strongly suggesting that allelic diversification occurred after divergence of the two subspecies. The present results were discussed in relation to the maintenance of agronomically valuable genes in various landraces.
8790446	Mitochondrial plasmid-like DNAs of the B1 family in the genus Oryza: sequence heterogeneity and evolution.	1995	Jpn J Genet	Four kinds of circular plasmid-like DNA, designated B1, B2, B3 and B4, have been found in the mitochondria of Oryza sativa L. with an AA genome. Three novel B1-homologous mitochondrial plasmid-like DNAs, designated, M1, M2 and M3, were isolated in the present study from strains with CC and CCDD genomes in the genus Oryza. We cloned and sequenced these DNAs and found that the sequences of these molecules have wide regions of homology. B1, M2 and M3 each lack about 300 bp of a region that is present in M1 and small repeats were found at the sites of deleted sequences. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that the B1 family differentiated from a common ancient molecule that was similar to M1 via, probably, slipped mispairing during DNA replication at several stages in the evolution in the genus Oryza.
3240862	Organization and nucleotide sequence of genes at both junctions between the two inverted repeats and the large single-copy region in the rice chloroplast genome.	1988	Gene	We describe the isolation and organization, at the nucleotide sequence level, of genes located at the two junctions of the large single-copy region (LSCR) and the two inverted repeats (IRA and IRB) in the rice chloroplast genome. This is the first example where the two junctions are precisely located in a monocot. In rice, a ribosomal protein gene cluster, rpl23-rpl2-rps19, which codes for the ribosomal proteins L23 (rpl23), L2 (rpl2) and S19 (rps19), lies at the ends of the two IRs near the LSCR. The inverted repeats end 45 bp from the translation stop codon of rps19. The gene for the 32-kDa photosystem II protein, psbA, is located at the extremity of the LSCR near IRA, and transcribed towards IRA. The translation stop codon of psbA is 68 bp from the right-hand junction (JLA). Thus, JLA is located within the intergenic sequence of the two genes, rps19 and psbA. Around the left-hand junction (JLB), there is a typical ribosomal protein gene cluster, rpl23-rpl2-rps19-rpl22 (rpl22 for the ribosomal protein L22). The translation start codon of rpl22 is located in the LSCR 25 bp from JLB. Therefore, JLB is located within the intergenic sequence between rps19 and rpl22.
3029686	Rice chloroplast DNA molecules are heterogeneous as revealed by DNA sequences of a cluster of genes.	1987	Nucleic Acids Res	We describe the isolation of two rice chloroplast HindIII fragments (9.5 kb and 5.3 kb) each containing a gene cluster coding for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), beta and epsilon subunits of ATPase (atpB and atpE), tRNAmet (trnM) and tRNAval (trnV). All five genes contained in the 9.5 kb fragment are potentially functional, whereas in the 5.3 kb fragment, rbcL is truncated and atpB is frame-shift mutated. The copy number of the 9.5 kb fragment is 10 times that of the 5.3 kb fragment, indicating that the two fragments are probably located on different chloroplast genomes and represent two different (major and minor) genomic populations. Thus, the rice chloroplast genome appears to be heterogeneous, contrary to general belief. We also describe the isolation of a rice mitochondrial HindIII fragment (6.9 kb) which contains an almost complete transferred copy of this chloroplast gene cluster. In this transferred copy, the coding sequences of rbcL, atpE and trnM contain perfectly normal reading frames, whereas atpB has become grossly defective and trnV is truncated.

17675406	Cell-type specificity of the expression of Os BOR1, a rice efflux boron transporter gene, is regulated in response to boron availability for efficient boron uptake and xylem loading.	2007	Plant Cell	We describe a boron (B) transporter, Os BOR1, in rice (Oryza sativa). Os BOR1 is a plasma membrane-localized efflux transporter of B and is required for normal growth of rice plants under conditions of limited B supply (referred to as -B). Disruption of Os BOR1 reduced B uptake and xylem loading of B. The accumulation of Os BOR1 transcripts was higher in roots than that in shoots and was not affected by B deprivation; however, Os BOR1 was detected in the roots of wild-type plants under -B conditions, but not under normal conditions, suggesting regulation of protein accumulation in response to B nutrition. Interestingly, tissue specificity of Os BOR1 expression is affected by B treatment. Transgenic rice plants containing an Os BOR1 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion construct grown with a normal B supply showed the strongest GUS activity in the steles, whereas after 3 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was elevated in the exodermis. After 6 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was again strong in the stele. Our results demonstrate that Os BOR1 is required both for efficient B uptake and for xylem loading of B. Possible roles of the temporal changes in tissue-specific patterns of Os BOR1 expression in response to B condition are discussed.
8437578	Identification of the entire set of transferred chloroplast DNA sequences in the mitochondrial genome of rice.	1993	Mol Gen Genet	The entire set of transferred chloroplast DNA sequences in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) was identified using clone banks that cover the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial fragments that were homologous to chloroplast DNA were mapped and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences around the termini of integrated chloroplast sequences in the rice mtDNA revealed no common sequences or structures that might enhance the transfer of DNA. Sixteen chloroplast sequences, ranging from 32 bases to 6.8 kb in length, were found to be dispersed throughout the rice mitochondrial genome. The total length of these sequences is equal to approximately 6% (22 kb) of the rice mitochondrial genome and to 19% of the chloroplast genome. The transfer of segments of chloroplast DNA seems to have occurred at different times, both before and after the divergence of rice and maize. The mitochondrial genome appears to have been rearranged after the transfer of chloroplast sequences as a result of recombination at these sequences. The rice mitochondrial DNA contains nine intact tRNA genes and three tRNA pseudogenes derived from the chloroplast genome.
8625419	Multiple initiation sites for transcription of a gene for subunit 1 of F1-ATPase (atp1) in rice mitochondria.	1996	Curr Genet	We identified the sites for the initiation of transcription of a gene for subunit 1 of F1-ATPase (atp1) in rice mitochondrial DNA. Capping and ribonuclease protection experiments in vitro, together with primer extension analysis, demonstrated that there were at least eight transcription initiation sites upstream of atp1. One initiation site, expressed most actively, was flanked by a sequence identical to the consensus promotor motif of rice mitochondrial genes. However, the sequences surrounding the other seven initiation sites exhibited no similarity to the consensus sequence.
8625418	The gene for a subunit of an ABC-type heme transporter is transcribed together with the gene for subunit 6 of NADH dehydrogenase in rice mitochondria.	1996	Curr Genet	We previously identified a chloroplast-derived (ct-derived) sequence of 32 base pairs (bp) in rice mitochondrial DNA that includes a part (30 bp; psitrnI) of a gene for isoleucine tRNA (CAU) of the chloroplast. Analyzing the ct-derived psitrnI, we found that an open reading frame (orf240), which was homologous to the gene for a subunit of an ATP-binding cassette-type (ABC-type) heme transporter, namely helC, of Rhodobacter capsulatus, and a gene for subunit 6 of NADH dehydrogenase (nad6) were located upstream of and downstream from the ct-derived psitrnI, respectively. Northern-blot hybridization and analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that both orf240 and nad6 were co-transcribed in rice mitochondria. An analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of the region of orf240/nad6 from the DNA of some Gramineae suggests that the arrangement of orf240/nad6 was generated in the mitochondrial genome of the genus Oryza during evolution after its divergence from the other Gramineae. Most of the transcripts of orf240 are edited, with a change from cytidine to uridine, at 35 positions. Editing of the RNA changes 33 amino-acid residues among the 240 encoded amino-acid residues, suggesting that the orf240 gene is functional in rice mitochondria.
7509206	Palindromic repeated sequences (PRSs) in the mitochondrial genome of rice: evidence for their insertion after divergence of the genus Oryza from the other Gramineae.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	We have identified a family of small repeated sequences (from 60 to 66 bp in length) in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). There are at least ten copies of these sequences and they are distributed throughout the mitochondrial genome. Each is potentially capable of forming a stem-and-loop structure and we have designated them PRSs (palindromic repeated sequences). Their features are reminiscent of the small dispersed repeats in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of some lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Some of the PRSs of rice mtDNA are located in the intron of the gene for ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) and in the flanking sequence of the gene for chloroplast-like tRNA(Asn) (trnN). analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of these regions from the DNA of some Gramineae suggests that the PRSs were inserted into these regions of the Oryza mtDNA after the divergence of Oryza from the other Gramineae.
7599319	A small repeated sequence contains the transcription initiation sites for both trnfM and rrn26 in rice mitochondria.	1995	Plant Mol Biol	The 76 bp sequence found in the upstream region of a gene for 26S rRNA (rrn26) is duplicated in the upstream region of a gene for initiator methionine tRNA (trnfM) in the mitochondrial genome of rice. An in vitro capping/ribonuclease protection assay and primer extension analysis demonstrated that the transcription of trnfM and of rrn26, which are at least 190 kb from one another in the rice mitochondrial genome, starts from these same sequences in the upstream regions of the respective genes. This result indicates that the short sequence that is duplicated in the upstream regions of trnfM and rrn26 in rice mtDNA is recognized as the promoter of each respective gene.
16987950	The shoot stem cell niche in angiosperms: expression patterns of WUS orthologues in rice and maize imply major modifications in the course of mono- and dicot evolution.	2006	Mol Biol Evol	In Arabidopsis, stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is controlled by a feedback loop between WUS and CLV functions. We have identified WUS orthologues in maize and rice by a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the WOX gene family and subsequent cloning. A single WUS orthologue is present in the rice genome (OsWUS), whereas the allotetraploid maize genome contains 2 WUS paralogues (ZmWUS1 and ZmWUS2). None of the isolated grass WUS orthologues displays an organizing center-type expression pattern in the vegetative SAM as in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the grass-specific expression patterns relate to the specification of new phytomers consistent with the transcriptional expression patterns of TD1 and FON1 (CLV1 orthologues of maize and rice, respectively). Moreover, the grass WUS and CLV1 orthologues are coexpressed in all reproductive meristems, where fasciation and supernumerary floral organs occur in td1 or fon1 loss-of-function mutants. The expression patterns of WUS orthologues in both grass species compared with those of dicots imply that major changes in WUS function, which are correlated with changes in CLV1 signaling, have occurred during angiosperm evolution and raise doubts about the uniqueness of the WUS/CLV antagonism in the maintenance of the shoot stem cell niche in grasses.
17768306	WOX gene phylogeny in Poaceae: a comparative approach addressing leaf and embryo development.	2007	Mol Biol Evol	The phylogeny based on the homeodomain (HD) amino acid sequence of the WOX (WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene family) was established in the 3 major radiations of the Poaceae family: Pooideae (Brachypodium distachyon), Bambusoideae (Oryza sativa), and Panicoideae (Zea mays). The genomes of all 3 grasses contain an ancient duplication in the WOX3 branch, and the cellular expression patterns in maize and rice indicate subfunctionalization of paralogues during leaf development, which may relate to the architecture of the grass leaf and the encircling of the stem. The use of maize WOX gene family members as molecular markers in maize embryo development for the first time allowed us to visualize cellular decisions in the maize proembryo, including specification of the shoot/root axis at an oblique angle to the apical-basal polarity of the zygote. All molecular marker data are compatible with the conclusion that the embryonic shoot/root axis comprises a discrete domain from early proembryo stages onward. Novel cell fates of the shoot and the root are acquired within this distinct morphogenic axis domain, which elongates and thus separates the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem (RAM) anlagen in the maize embryo.
2534354	The nucleotide sequences and expression of genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of ATP synthase from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1989	Jpn J Genet	The genes for the beta and epsilon subunits of ATP synthase were cloned from rice chloroplast DNA. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of these genes were determined. The site of initiation of transcription was examined by S1-mapping analysis. The relation between stability of mRNA and that of a stem and loop structure at the 3' end of mRNA is discussed.
18193402	Detection of quantitative trait loci controlling extremely early heading in rice.	2008	Theor Appl Genet	To clarify the genetic basis of extremely early heading in rice, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using F2 populations from two genetically wide cross combinations, Hayamasari/Kasalath (HaF2) and Hoshinoyume/Kasalath (HoF2). Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume are extremely early-heading japonica cultivars. Photoperiod sensitivity is completely lost in Hayamasari and weak in Hoshinoyume. Three QTLs, QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7), and QTL(chr8), for days-to-heading (DTH) in HaF2 were detected on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8, respectively, and QTL(chr6) and QTL(chr7) were detected in HoF2. On the basis of the chromosomal locations, QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7), and QTL(chr8) may be likely to be Hd1, Hd4, and Hd5, respectively, which had been detected previously as QTLs for DTH in an F2 population of NipponbarexKasalath. Alleles of QTL(chr7) decreased DTH dramatically in both Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume, suggesting that QTL(chr7) has a major role in determining extremely early heading. In addition, allele-specific interactions were detected between QTL(chr6), QTL(chr7) and QTL(chr8). This result suggests that not only allelic differences but also epistatic interactions contribute to extremely early heading. QTL(chr8) was detected in HaF2, but not in HoF2, suggesting that it determines the difference in DTH between Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume. A major QTL was also detected in the region of QTL(chr8) in QTL analysis using an F2 population of HayamasarixHoshinoyume. This result supports the idea that QTL(chr8) is a major factor that determines the difference in DTH between Hayamasari and Hoshinoyume, and is involved in photoperiod sensitivity.
18308732	A novel NAC transcription factor, IDEF2, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants.	2008	J Biol Chem	Iron is essential for most living organisms, and thus iron deficiency poses a major abiotic stress in crop production. Plants induce iron utilization systems under conditions of low iron availability, but the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation under iron deficiency remain largely unknown. We identified a novel transcription factor of rice and barley, IDEF2, which specifically binds to the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element 2 (IDE2) by yeast one-hybrid screening. IDEF2 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the NAC transcription factor family and exhibits novel properties of sequence recognition. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cyclic amplification and selection of targets experiment revealed that IDEF2 predominantly recognized CA(A/C)G(T/C)(T/C/A)(T/C/A) within IDE2 as the core-binding site. IDEF2 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves. Repression of the function of IDEF2 by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) caused aberrant iron homeostasis in rice. Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes. Many genes with repressed expression in IDEF2 RNAi rice possessed the IDEF2-binding core sites in their promoters, and the flanking sequences were also highly homologous to IDE2. IDEF2 bound to OsYSL2 promoter region containing the binding core site, suggesting direct regulation of OsYSL2 expression. These results reveal novel cis-element/trans-factor interactions functionally associated with iron homeostasis.
17634747	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced via geranylgeranyl diphosphate in suspension-cultured rice cells after treatment with a chitin elicitor. We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1, EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression (LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.
17893735	Different patterns of genealogical relationships found in the two major QTLs causing reduction of seed shattering during rice domestication.	2007	Genome	The three quantitative trait loci (qSH1, qSH3, and qSH4) causing reduction of seed shattering were investigated to examine their relative importance during rice domestication. The qSH1 and qSH4 loci showed a distinct effect on the reduction of shattering, compared with the qSH3 locus. Fine mapping and sequence analysis strongly suggested that the qSH1 and qSH4 loci are the same as the recently reported genes. A non-shattering allele at qSH1 drastically changed the shattering phenotype to a non-shattering phenotype even in the presence of shattering alleles at the qSH3 and qSH4 loci, showing that qSH1 is genetically epistatic to the other loci. The level of the reduction in sequence diversity was compared between the qSH1 and qSH4 regions. The sequence diversity was severely reduced in the qSH1 region of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica compared with that of O. sativa subsp. indica, despite that the level of diversity was similarly reduced at the qSH4 region in the 2 subspecies. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined sequences of the flanking sites showed different patterns in the 2 subspecies. The 2 subspecies formed a single clade with respect to qSH4, whereas they were separated into different lineages with respect to qSH1, suggesting that these loci had different histories during rice domestication.
17913295	Overexpression of transcription factor OsLFL1 delays flowering time in Oryza sativa.	2008	J Plant Physiol	Flowering time is regulated by genetic programs and environment signals in plants. Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flower induction. Genotype W378 is a rice (Oryza sativa) late-flowering mutant selected from our collections of T-DNA insertion line. The T-DNA flanking gene in mutant W378 codes OsLFL1 (O. sativa LEC2 and FUSCA3 Like 1), a putative B3 DNA-binding domain-containing transcription factor. In wild-type rice OsLFL1 is expressed exclusively in spikes and young embryos, while in mutant W378 it is ectopically expressed. Introduction of OsLFL1-RNAi into mutant W378 successfully down-regulated OsLFL1 expression and restored flowering to almost normal time, indicating that overexpression of OsLFL1 confers late flowering for mutant W378. The flowering-promoting gene Ehd1 and its downstream genes are all down-regulated in W378. Thus, overexpression of OsLFL1 might delay the flowering of W378 by repressing the expression of Ehd1.
18562767	Mutation of the rice Narrow leaf1 gene, which encodes a novel protein, affects vein patterning and polar auxin transport.	2008	Plant Physiol	The size and shape of the plant leaf is an important agronomic trait. To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant named narrow leaf1 (nal1), which exhibits a characteristic phenotype of narrow leaves. In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins. Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation analyses demonstrated that Nal1 encodes a plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function. We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity. These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth.
17506327	OsWRKY13 mediates rice disease resistance by regulating defense-related genes in salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent signaling.	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Although 109 WRKY genes have been identified in the rice genome, the functions of most are unknown. Here, we show that OsWRKY13 plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance. Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility. This overexpression was accompanied by the activation of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes and SA-responsive genes and the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes and JA-responsive genes. OsWRKY13 bound to the promoters of its own and at least three other genes in SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. Its DNA-binding activity was influenced by pathogen infection. These results suggest that OsWRKY13, as an activator of the SA-dependent pathway and a suppressor of JA-dependent pathways, mediates rice resistance by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a subset of genes acting both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. Furthermore, OsWRKY13 will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider-spectrum and whole-growth-stage resistance rice in breeding programs.
18467323	Expression pattern and activity of six glutelin gene promoters in transgenic rice.	2008	J Exp Bot	The shortage of strong endosperm-specific expression promoters for driving the expression of recombinant protein genes in cereal endosperm is a major limitation in obtaining the required level and pattern of expression. Six promoters of seed storage glutelin genes (GluA-1, GluA-2, GluA-3, GluB-3, GluB-5, and GluC) were isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) genomic DNA by PCR. Their spatial and temporal expression patterns and expression potential in stable transgenic rice plants were examined with beta-glucuronidase (GUS) used as a reporter gene. All the promoters showed the expected spatial expression within the endosperm. The GluA-1, GluA-2, and GluA-3 promoters directed GUS expression mainly in the outer portion (peripheral region) of the endosperm. The GluB-5 and GluC promoters directed GUS expression in the whole endosperm, with the latter expressed almost evenly throughout the whole endosperm, a feature different from that of other rice glutelin gene promoters. The GluB-3 promoter directed GUS expression solely in aleurone and subaleurone layers. Promoter activities examined during seed maturation showed that the GluC promoter had much higher activity than the other promoters. These promoters are ideal candidates for achieving gene expression for multiple purposes in monocot endosperm but avoid promoter homology-based gene silencing. The GluC promoter did not contain the endosperm specificity-determining motifs GCN4, AACA, and the prolamin-box, which suggests the existence of additional regulatory mechanism in determining endosperm specificity.
17339651	OsMTN encodes a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase that is up-regulated during submergence-induced ethylene synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2007	J Exp Bot	Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is released as a by-product of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent reactions central to ethylene, polyamine, or phytosiderophore biosynthesis. MTA is hydrolysed by methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTN; EC 3.2.2.16) into adenine and methylthioribose which is processed through the methionine (Met) cycle to produce a new molecule of AdoMet. In deepwater rice, submergence enhances ethylene biosynthesis, and ethylene in turn influences the methionine cycle through positive feedback regulation of the acireductone dioxygenase gene OsARD1. In rice, MTN is encoded by a single gene designated OsMTN. Recombinant OsMTN enzyme had a KM for MTA of 2.1 mM and accepted a wide array of 5' substitutions of the substrate. OsMTN also metabolized S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) with 15.9% the rate of MTA. OsMTN transcripts and OsMTN-specific activity increased slowly and in parallel upon submergence, indicating that regulation occurred mainly at the transcriptional level. Neither ethylene, MTA, nor Met regulated OsMTN expression. Analysis of steady-state metabolite levels showed that MTN activity was sufficiently high to prevent Met and AdoMet depletion during long-term ethylene biosynthesis.
18583359	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	2008	Nucleic Acids Res	The DMC1 protein, a meiosis-specific DNA recombinase, catalyzes strand exchange between homologous chromosomes. In rice, two Dmc1 genes, Dmc1A and Dmc1B, have been reported. Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined. In the present study, we expressed the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins in bacteria and purified them. The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor. The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs. In contrast, the human DMC1 protein strictly required RPA to promote strand exchange with these long DNA substrates. The strand-exchange activity of the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein was much higher than that of the DMC1B protein. Consistently, the DNA-binding activity of the DMC1A protein was higher than that of the DMC1B protein. These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice.
2791032	Nucleotide sequence and molecular characterization of plasmid-like DNAs from mitochondria of cytoplasmic male-sterile rice.	1989	Curr Genet	Two plasmid-like DNAs, B2 and B3, were isolated from mitochondria of the cytoplasmic male-sterile rice, A-58 CMS. Molecular clones having their complete sequences were constructed and used as probes of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes by Southern hybridization. No evidence was found that integrated copies of either one exist in the main mitochondrial genome, but sequences homologous to both were present in the nuclear genome. The complete nucleotide sequences of B2 and B3 were established and compared to those of rice B1 and B4 and to the 1.9- and the 1.4-kbp plasmid-like DNAs of maize. Many of the sequences were common to both plant species.
18604208	Deletion in a gene associated with grain size increased yields during rice domestication.	2008	Nat Genet	The domestication of crops involves a complex process of selection in plant evolution and is associated with changes in the DNA regulating agronomically important traits. Here we report the cloning of a newly identified QTL, qSW5 (QTL for seed width on chromosome 5), involved in the determination of grain width in rice. Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in qSW5 resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice grains. In addition, we mapped two other defective functional nucleotide polymorphisms of rice domestication-related genes with genome-wide RFLP polymorphisms of various rice landraces. These analyses show that the qSW5 deletion had an important historical role in artificial selection, propagation of cultivation and natural crossings in rice domestication, and shed light on how the rice genome was domesticated.
17520342	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of OsBISERK1, a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, during disease resistance responses in rice.	2008	Mol Biol Rep	A rice gene, OsBISERK1, encoding a protein belonging to SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) type of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) was identified. The OsBISERK1 encodes a 624 aa protein with high level of identity to known plant SERKs. OsBISERK1 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide, a leucine zipper, and five leucine-rich repeat motifs in the extracellular domain; the cytoplasmic region carries a proline-rich region and a single transmembrane domain, as well as a conserved intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain. OsBISERK1 has a low level of basal expression in leaf tissue. However, expression of OsBISERK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice, and also up-regulated after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during incompatible interaction between a blast-resistant rice genotype and M. grisea. The results suggest that OsBISERK1 may be involved in disease resistance responses in rice.
17727616	The rice nuclear gene, VIRESCENT 2, is essential for chloroplast development and encodes a novel type of guanylate kinase targeted to plastids and mitochondria.	2007	Plant J	Guanylate kinase (GK) is a critical enzyme in guanine nucleotide metabolism pathways, catalyzing the phosphorylation of (d)GMP to (d)GDP. Here we show that a novel gene, VIRESCENT 2 (V2), encodes a new type of GK (designated pt/mtGK) that is localized in plastids and mitochondria. We initially identified the V2 gene by positional cloning of the rice v2 mutant. The v2 mutant is temperature-sensitive and develops chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures. The v2 mutation causes inhibition of chloroplast differentiation; in particular, it disrupts the chloroplast translation machinery during early leaf development [Sugimoto et al. (2004)Plant Cell Physiol. 45, 985]. In the bacterial and animal species studied to date, GK is localized in the cytoplasm and participates in maintenance of the guanine nucleotide pools required for many fundamental cellular processes. Phenotypic analysis of rice seedlings with RNAi knockdown of cytosolic GK (designated cGK) showed that cGK is indispensable for the growth and development of plants, but not for chloroplast development. Thus, rice has two types of GK, as does Arabidopsis, suggesting that higher plants have two types of GK. Our results suggest that, of the two types of GK, only pt/mtGK is essential for chloroplast differentiation.

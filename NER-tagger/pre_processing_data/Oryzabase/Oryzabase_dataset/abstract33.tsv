24584249	Genetic diversity analysis reveals that geographical environment plays a more important role than rice cultivar in Villosiclava virens population selection.	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	Rice false smut caused by Villosiclava virens is an economically important disease of grains worldwide. The genetic diversity of 153 isolates from six fields located in Wuhan (WH), Yichang Wangjia (YCW), Yichang Yaohe (YCY), Huanggang (HG), Yangxin (YX), and Jingzhou (JZ) in Hubei province of China were phylogenetically analyzed to evaluate the influence of environments and rice cultivars on the V. virens populations. Isolates (43) from Wuhan were from two rice cultivars, Wanxian 98 and Huajing 952, while most of the other isolates from fields YCW, YCY, HG, YX, and JZ originated from different rice cultivars with different genetic backgrounds. Genetic diversity of isolates was analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The isolates from the same cultivars in Wuhan tended to group together, indicating that the cultivars had an important impact on the fungal population. The 110 isolates from individual fields tended to cluster according to geographical origin. The values of Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's information index (I) showed that the genetic diversity among isolates was higher between than within geographical populations. Furthermore, mean genetic distance between groups (0.006) was higher than mean genetic distance within groups (0.0048) according to MEGA 5.2. The pairwise population fixation index (FST) values also showed significant genetic differentiation between most populations. Higher genetic similarity of isolates from individual fields but different rice cultivars suggested that the geographical factor played a more important role in the selection of V. virens isolates than rice cultivars. This information could be used to improve the management strategy for rice false smut by adjusting the cultivation measures, such as controlling fertilizer, water, and planting density, in the rice field to change the microenvironment.
24590858	Rice fertilization-Independent Endosperm1 regulates seed size under heat stress by controlling early endosperm development.	2014	Plant Physiol	Although heat stress reduces seed size in rice (Oryza sativa), little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed reduction in seed size and yield. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of heat sensitivity and reduced seed size, we imposed a moderate (34°C) and a high (42°C) heat stress treatment on developing rice seeds during the postfertilization stage. Both stress treatments reduced the final seed size. At a cellular level, the moderate heat stress resulted in precocious endosperm cellularization, whereas severe heat-stressed seeds failed to cellularize. Initiation of endosperm cellularization is a critical developmental transition required for normal seed development, and it is controlled by Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We observed that a member of PRC2 called Fertilization-Independent Endosperm1 (OsFIE1) was sensitive to temperature changes, and its expression was negatively correlated with the duration of the syncytial stage during heat stress. Seeds from plants overexpressing OsFIE1 had reduced seed size and exhibited precocious cellularization. The DNA methylation status and a repressive histone modification of OsFIE1 were observed to be temperature sensitive. Our data suggested that the thermal sensitivity of seed enlargement could partly be caused by altered epigenetic regulation of endosperm development during the transition from the syncytial to the cellularized state.
24575773	What happens to plant mitochondria under low oxygen? An omics review of the responses to low oxygen and reoxygenation.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Floods can rapidly submerge plants, limiting oxygen to the extent that oxidative phosphorylation no longer generates adequate ATP supplies. Low-oxygen tolerant plants, such as rice, are able to adequately respond to low oxygen by successfully remodelling primary and mitochondrial metabolism to partially counteract the energy crisis that ensues. In this review, we discuss how plants respond to low-oxygen stress at the transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and enzyme activity levels, particularly focusing on mitochondria and interacting pathways. The role of reactive oxygen species and nitrite as an alternative electron acceptor as well as their links to respiratory chain components is discussed. By making intra-kingdom as well as cross-kingdom comparisons, conserved mechanisms of anoxia tolerance are highlighted as well as tolerance mechanisms that are specific to anoxia-tolerant rice during germination and in coleoptiles. We discuss reoxygenation as an often overlooked, yet essential stage of this environmental stress and consider the possibility that changes occurring during low oxygen may also provide benefits upon re-aeration. Finally, we consider what it takes to be low-oxygen tolerant and argue that alternative mechanisms of ATP production, glucose signalling, starch/sucrose signalling as well as reverse metabolism of fermentation end products promote the survival of rice after this debilitating stress.
24564253	Identification of putative TAL effector targets of the citrus canker pathogens shows functional convergence underlying disease development and defense response.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effectors, formerly known as the AvrBs3/PthA protein family, are DNA-binding effectors broadly found in Xanthomonas spp. that transactivate host genes upon injection via the bacterial type three-secretion system. Biologically relevant targets of TAL effectors, i.e. host genes whose induction is vital to establish a compatible interaction, have been reported for xanthomonads that colonize rice and pepper; however, citrus genes modulated by the TAL effectors PthA"s" and PthC"s" of the citrus canker bacteria Xanthomonas citri (Xc) and Xanthomonas aurantifolii pathotype C (XaC), respectively, are poorly characterized. Of particular interest, XaC causes canker disease in its host lemon (Citrus aurantifolia), but triggers a defense response in sweet orange.

RESULTS: Based on, 1) the TAL effector-DNA binding code, 2) gene expression data of Xc and XaC-infiltrated sweet orange leaves, and 3) citrus hypocotyls transformed with PthA2, PthA4 or PthC1, we have identified a collection of Citrus sinensis genes potentially targeted by Xc and XaC TAL effectors. Our results suggest that similar with other strains of Xanthomonas TAL effectors, PthA2 and PthA4, and PthC1 to some extent, functionally converge. In particular, towards induction of genes involved in the auxin and gibberellin synthesis and response, cell division, and defense response. We also present evidence indicating that the TAL effectors act as transcriptional repressors and that the best scoring predicted DNA targets of PthA"s" and PthC"s" in citrus promoters predominantly overlap with or localize near to TATA boxes of core promoters, supporting the idea that TAL effectors interact with the host basal transcriptional machinery to recruit the RNA pol II and start transcription.

CONCLUSIONS: The identification of PthA"s" and PthC"s" targets, such as the LOB (lateral organ boundary) and CCNBS genes that we report here, is key for the understanding of the canker symptoms development during host susceptibility, or the defenses of sweet orange against the canker bacteria. We have narrowed down candidate targets to a few, which pointed out the host metabolic pathways explored by the pathogens.
24634194	Expression of the key genes involved in ABA biosynthesis in rice implanted by ion beam.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in adaptive stress responses to abiotic environments, but little information exists about its responses to implantation with low-energy ion beams. The genes related to ABA synthesis including zeaxanthin epoxidase(ZEP), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO), short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase-like(SDR), and cytochrome P450 in rice seedlings germinating from seeds implanted by ion beam for 72, 96, and 120 h after imbibitions (HAI) were determined by real-time PCR. Moreover, we also explored the changes of endogenous ABA content in rice seedlings after 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h after imbibitions using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that ion beam implantation could enhance the genes' transcription activity which was involved in ABA biosynthesis. However, the response of each gene is not consistent with the underlying differences in ion flux. The obviously up-regulated expression of ZEP, AAO2, SDR, and P450-2 were observed underlying the behaviour at an ion flux of 1 × 10(17) N(+)/cm(2). However, the expression of NCED, AAO1, and SDR2 can be enhanced by 5 × 10(17) N(+)/cm(2). The expression of AAO3, SDR1, and P450-1 can be elevated underlying the both ion flux of 1 × 10(17) N(+)/cm(2) and 5 × 10(17) N(+)/cm(2). The expression of SDR3 can be enhanced in every ion flux. The results of ELISA showed that endogenous ABA level in rice seedlings increased at treatment with vacuum, 1 × 10(17) and 5 × 10(17) N(+)/cm(2). Collectively, ion beam irritation can enhance the expression of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis, resulting in increasing content of endogenous ABA in rice. Our findings suggest that ABA pathway was involved in the adaption to irradiation with ion beam in plants.
24684666	A barley PHD finger transcription factor that confers male sterility by affecting tapetal development.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Controlling pollen development is of major commercial importance in generating hybrid crops and selective breeding, but characterized genes for male sterility in crops are rare, with no current examples in barley. However, translation of knowledge from model species is now providing opportunities to understand and manipulate such processes in economically important crops. We have used information from regulatory networks in Arabidopsis to identify and functionally characterize a barley PHD transcription factor MALE STERTILITY1 (MS1), which expresses in the anther tapetum and plays a critical role during pollen development. Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis, rice and Brachypodium genomes was used to identify conserved regions in MS1 for primer design to amplify the barley MS1 gene; RACE-PCR was subsequently used to generate the full-length sequence. This gene shows anther-specific tapetal expression, between late tetrad stage and early microspore release. HvMS1 silencing and overexpression in barley resulted in male sterility. Additionally, HvMS1 cDNA, controlled by the native Arabidopsis MS1 promoter, successfully complemented the homozygous ms1 Arabidopsis mutant. These results confirm the conservation of MS1 function in higher plants and in particular in temperate cereals. This has provided the first example of a characterized male sterility gene in barley, which presents a valuable tool for the future control of male fertility in barley for hybrid development.
24478288	Nanohydroxyapatite shape and its potential role in bone formation: an analytical study.	2014	J R Soc Interface	Bone cells (osteoblasts) produce a collagen-rich matrix called osteoid, which is mineralized extracellularly by nanosized calcium phosphate (CaP). Synthetically produced CaP nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential for clinical application. However few studies have compared the effect of CaP NPs with different properties, such as shape and aspect ratio, on the survival and behaviour of active bone-producing cells, such as primary human osteoblasts (HOBs). This study aimed to investigate the biocompatibility and ultrastructural effects of two differently shaped hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] nanoparticles (HA NPs), round- (aspect ratio 2.12, AR2) and rice-shaped (aspect ratio 3.79, AR4). The ultrastructural response and initial extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of HOBs to HA NPs were observed, as well as matrix vesicle release. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based X-ray microanalytical technique was used to measure cytoplasmic ion levels, including calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na) and potassium (K). K/Na ratios were used as a measure of cell viability. Following HA NP stimulation, all measured cytoplasmic ion levels increased. AR2 NPs had a greater osteogenic effect on osteoblasts compared with AR4 NPs, including alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix vesicle release. However, they produced only a moderate increase in intracellular Ca and P levels compared with AR4. This suggests that particular Ca and P concentrations may be required for, or indicative of, optimal osteoblast activity. Cell viability, as measured by Na and K microanalysis, was best maintained in AR2. Initial formation of osteoblast ECM was altered in the presence of either HA NP, and immuno-TEM identified fibronectin and matrilin-3 as two ECM proteins affected. Matrilin-3 is here described for the first time as being expressed by cultured osteoblasts. In summary, this novel and in-depth study has demonstrated that HA NP shape can influence a range of different parameters related to osteoblast viability and activity.
24473456	Aspergillus cumulatus sp. nov., from rice straw and air for meju fermentation.	2014	J Microbiol Biotechnol	A new species named Aspergillus cumulatus sp. nov. is described in Aspergillus section Aspergillus (Eurotium state). The type strain (KACC 47316(T)) of this species was isolated from rice straw used in meju fermentations in Korea, and other strains were isolated from the air in a meju fermentation room. The species is characterized by growth at a wide range of water activities and the formation of aerial hyphae on malt extract 60% sucrose agar (ME60S) that resemble a cumulus cloud. Furthermore, A. cumulatus produces yellow ascomata containing small lenticular ascospores (5.1-5.7 μm) with a wide furrow, low equatorial crests, and tuberculate convex surface. The species is phylogenetically distinct from the other reported Aspergillus section Aspergillus species based on multilocus sequence typing using rDNA-ITS, β-tubulin, calmodulin, and RNA polymerase II genes.
24615161	Investment in plant research and development bears fruit in China.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Recent rapid progress in plant science and biotechnology in China demonstrates that China's stronger support for funding in plant research and development (R&D) has borne fruit. Chinese groups have contributed major advances in a range of fields, such as rice biology, plant hormone and developmental biology, genomics and evolution, plant genetics and epigenetics, as well as plant biotechnology. Strigolactone studies including those identifying its receptor and dissecting its complex structure and signaling are representative of the recent researches from China at the forefront of the field. These advances are attributable in large part to interdisciplinary studies among scientists from plant science, chemistry, bioinformatics, structural biology, and agronomy. The platforms provided by national facilities facilitate this collaboration. As well, efficient restructuring of the top-down organization of state programs and free exploration of scientists' interests have accelerated achievements by Chinese researchers. Here, we provide a general outline of China's progress in plant R&D to highlight fields in which Chinese research has made significant contributions.
24478945	Effect of polyols on thermostability of xylanase from a tropical isolate of Aureobasidium pullulans and its application in prebleaching of rice straw pulp.	2014	Springerplus	In an attempt to find a thermostable xylanase enzyme for potential application in the pretreatment prior to H2O2 bleaching of paper pulp for industry, an extracellular xylanase from Aureobasidium pullulans CBS 135684 was purified 17.3-fold to apparent homogeneity with a recovery yield of 13.7%. Its molecular mass was approximately 72 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The optimal pH and temperature for activity of the purified enzyme were pH 6.0 and 70°C, respectively. The enzyme was relatively stable at 50°C, retaining more than half of its original activity after 3-h incubation. The thermostability of the enzyme was improved by the addition of 0.75 mM sorbitol prolonging the enzyme's activity up to 10-fold at 70°C. When the potential of using the enzyme in pretreatment of rice straw pulp prior to bleaching was evaluated, the greatest efficiency was obtained in a mixture containing xylanase and sorbitol. Treatment of the rice straw pulp with xylanase prior to treatment with 10% (v/v) H2O2 and production of hand sheets increased the ISO sheet brightness by 13.5% and increased the tensile and tear strengths of the pulp by up to 1.16 and 1.71-fold, respectively, compared with pulps treated with H2O2 alone. The results suggested the potential application of the enzyme before the bleaching process of paper pulp when the maintenance of high temperature and enzyme stability are desirable.
24727792	Expression of peanut Iron Regulated Transporter 1 in tobacco and rice plants confers improved iron nutrition.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Iron (Fe) limitation is a widespread agricultural problem in calcareous soils and severely limits crop production. Iron Regulated Transporter 1 (IRT1) is a key component for Fe uptake from the soil in dicot plants. In this study, the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) AhIRT1 was introduced into tobacco and rice plants using an Fe-deficiency-inducible artificial promoter. Induced expression of AhIRT1 in tobacco plants resulted in accumulation of Fe in young leaves under Fe deficient conditions. Even under Fe-excess conditions, the Fe concentration was also markedly enhanced, suggesting that the Fe status did not affect the uptake and translocation of Fe by AhIRT1 in the transgenic plants. Most importantly, the transgenic tobacco plants showed improved tolerance to Fe limitation in culture in two types of calcareous soils. Additionally, the induced expression of AhIRT1 in rice plants also resulted in high tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soils.
24648215	Seed-specific silencing of OsMRP5 reduces seed phytic acid and weight in rice.	2014	Transgenic Res	Phytic acid (PA) is poorly digested by humans and monogastric animals and negatively affects human/animal nutrition and the environment. Rice mutants with reduced PA content have been developed but are often associated with reduced seed weight and viability, lacking breeding value. In the present study, a new approach was explored to reduce seed PA while attaining competitive yield. The OsMRP5 gene, of which mutations are known to reduce seed PA as well as seed yield and viability, was down-regulated specifically in rice seeds by using an artificial microRNA driven by the rice seed specific promoter Ole18. Seed PA contents were reduced by 35.8-71.9% in brown rice grains of transgenic plants compared to their respective null plants (non-transgenic plants derived from the same event). No consistent significant differences of plant height or number of tillers per plant were observed, but significantly lower seed weights (up to 17.8% reduction) were detected in all transgenic lines compared to null plants, accompanied by reductions of seed germination and seedling emergence. It was observed that the silencing of the OsMRP5 gene increased the inorganic P (Pi) levels (up to 7.5 times) in amounts more than the reduction of PA-P in brown rice. This indicates a reduction in P content in other cellular compounds, such as lipids and nucleic acids, which may affect overall seed development. Put together, the present study demonstrated that seed specific silencing of OsMRP5 could significantly reduce the PA content and increase Pi levels in seeds; however, it also significantly lowers seed weight in rice. Discussions were made regarding future directions towards producing agronomically competitive and nutritionally valuable low PA rice.

24728502	Multiple exposure and effects assessment of heavy metals in the population near mining area in South China.	2014	PLoS One	The objective of this study was to investigate the levels of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in the environment and several important food sources grown and consumed in the vicinity of Dabaoshan mine in Southern China, and evaluate potential health risks among local residents. The Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn concentrations of arable soils and well water near the mines exceeded the quality standard values. The concentrations of Cd and Pb in some food crops (rice grain, vegetable and soybean) samples were significantly higher than the maximum permissible level. The Cd and Pb concentrations in half of the chicken and fish meat samples were higher than the national standard. The residents living near Dabaoshan mine had higher Cd and Pb levels in hair than those of a non-exposed population. The intake of rice was identified as a major contributor to the estimated daily intake of these metals by the residents. The hazard index values for adults and children were 10.25 and 11.11, respectively, with most of the estimated risks coming from the intake of home-grown rice and vegetables. This study highlights the importance of multiple pathways in studying health risk assessment of heavy metal exposure in China.
24388510	Dominance and epistasis are the main contributors to heterosis for plant height in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	The genetic basis of heterosis has been debated for over 100 years regarding whether dominance or overdominance plays a more important role and the answer is still unclear. The major limitation to assess the contribution of a single locus has been the genetic background noise due to genome-wide segregation of multiple loci. To dissect the genetic basis of heterosis at a single locus for plant height, we developed a set of 202 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of an elite hybrid, Shanyou 63, the best hybrid rice in China in the 1990s. Fifteen CSSLs had varied plant heights within lines. A total of 15 partial dominance QTLs for plant height were detected in these 15 CSSL-F2 populations. All hybrids between the 15 CSSLs and the recurrent parent, Zhenshan 97, were shorter than the corresponding CSSLs, but taller than Zhenshan 97. These indicated that these 15 QTLs were also heterosis loci (HLs) contributed to heterosis acted in dominance. Each HL contributed from -7.4 to 14.4% of midparent heterosis. Additive by additive (AA) and additive by dominance (AD) interactions were detected in the Tetra-F2 population segregating at the four major QTLs with the largest effects on plant height. Substantial negative AA effects were detected between two major QTLs QPH7.2 and QPH7.3, which increased heterosis in the study. Thus we concluded that dominance and epistasis are the major genetic basis of plant height heterosis, which could explain the better parent heterosis in Shanyou 63.
24475267	Characterizing roles for the glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin peroxidase-encoding genes of Magnaporthe oryzae during rice blast disease.	2014	PLoS One	Understanding how pathogenic fungi adapt to host plant cells is of major concern to securing global food production. The hemibiotrophic rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, cause of the most serious disease of cultivated rice, colonizes leaf cells asymptomatically as a biotroph for 4-5 days in susceptible rice cultivars before entering its destructive necrotrophic phase. During the biotrophic growth stage, M. oryzae remains undetected in the plant while acquiring nutrients and growing cell-to-cell. Which fungal processes facilitate in planta growth and development are still being elucidated. Here, we used gene functional analysis to show how components of the NADPH-requiring glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidation systems of M. oryzae contribute to disease. Loss of glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin peroxidase-encoding genes resulted in strains severely attenuated in their ability to grow in rice cells and that failed to produce spreading necrotic lesions on the leaf surface. Glutathione reductase, but not thioredoxin reductase or thioredoxin peroxidase, was shown to be required for neutralizing plant generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The thioredoxin proteins, but not glutathione reductase, were shown to contribute to cell-wall integrity. Furthermore, glutathione and thioredoxin gene expression, under axenic growth conditions, was dependent on both the presence of glucose and the M. oryzae sugar/ NADPH sensor Tps1, thereby suggesting how glucose availability, NADPH production and antioxidation might be connected. Taken together, this work identifies components of the fungal glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidation systems as determinants of rice blast disease that act to facilitate biotrophic colonization of host cells by M. oryzae.
24399256	Cell culture of the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens Stål (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	2014	In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim	The rice brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice in Asia. Although resistant rice varieties can be effective in managing planthopper populations, BPH has repeatedly been able to overcome resistant rice varieties. It is possible that BPH adaptation to resistant rice varieties may be related to its endosymbionts. We investigated methods for culturing BPH cells in order to study in-depth interactions between rice, BPH, and its endosymbionts. In this study, we tested EX-CELL™ 405, EX-CELL™ 420, Mitsuhashi and Maramorosch's medium, and Kimura's medium, for in vitro culture of BPH cells. Only Kimura's medium was found to be suitable for BPH cell culture, and BPH embryos around blastokinetic stage were the best source for BPH cell culture. Cells from BPH embryonic tissues adhered to the plate substrate, and the migration of cells was observed within 24 h in primary culture. After 3 mo of subculture, various types of BPH cells were successfully maintained in the Kimura's medium.
24720214	[Effect of flooding time length on mycorrhizal colonization of three AM fungi in two wetland plants].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	In order to provide information for elucidating effect of flooding on the formation and function of AM in wetland plants, three AM fungi (Glomus intraradices, Glomus versiforme, Glomus etunicatum) were used to investigate the effects of flooding time length on their colonization in cattail (Typha orientalis) and rice (Oryza sativa L. ). The results showed that the mycorrhizal colonization rate (MCR) presented downtrend with increasing flooding time length. In cattail, MCR of the fungus F3 was higher than those of fungi F1 and F2, but no significant difference in MCR was found between fungi F1 and F2. In rice, the MCRs of fungi F2 and F3 were higher than that of E1. In both plants, the proportional frequency of hyphae was the highest while the proportional frequency of arbuscules and vesicles was very low in all treatments, indicating that hyphal colonization was the main route for AM formation. The proportional frequency of hyphae in cattail increased with the flooding time length, but no significant trend was observed in rice plant. The proportional frequency of arhuscules decreased with the increase of flooding time, and was the highest in the treatment without flooding (treatment IV). The number of spores produced by AM fungi increased with increasing flooding time, and reached the highest in the treatment of long time flooding (treatment I). In the same treatment, the fungus F3 produced more spores than fungi F1 and F2. Changes in wet weight of the two plants showed that AM could increase cattail growth under flooding, hut little effect on rice growth was found. It is concluded that flooding time length significantly affected the mycorrhizal colonization rate and the proportional frequency of colonization. AM could enhance the growth of wetland plant, but this depends on the mycorrhizal dependence of host plant on AM fungi. Therefore, flooding time length should be considered in the inoculation of wetland plants with AM fungi.
24291309	Performance evaluation of anaerobic hybrid reactors with different packing media for treating wastewater of mild alkali treated rice straw in ethanol fermentation process.	2014	Bioresour Technol	Four anaerobic hybrid reactors with different packing media viz. gravel (R1), pumice stone (R2), polypropylene saddles (R3) and ceramic saddles (R4) were operated in semi-continuous mode. Biomethanation potential of the wastewater generated during alkali-treatment of rice straw in ethanol production process was investigated at ambient conditions. The reactors were operated with varying organic loading rates (0.861-4.313 g COD l(-1) d(-1)) and hydraulic retention time (3-15 days). Higher COD removal efficiency (69.2%) and methane yield (0.153 l CH4 g(-1) CODadded) were achieved in reactor R2 at 15 days HRT. Modified Stover-Kincannon model was applied to estimate the bio-kinetic coefficients and fitness of the model was checked by the regression coefficient for all the reactors. The model showed an excellent correlation between the experimental and predicted values. The present study demonstrated the treatment of wastewater from alkali treated rice straw for production of biogas.
24477586	In-silico mining, type and frequency analysis of genic microsatellites of finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.): a comparative genomic analysis of NBS-LRR regions of finger millet with rice.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	In recent years, the increased availability of the DNA sequences has given the possibility to develop and explore the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived SSR markers. In the present study, a total of 1956 ESTs of finger millet were used to find the microsatellite type, distribution, frequency and developed a total of 545 primer pairs from the ESTs of finger millet. Thirty-two EST sequences had more than two microsatellites and 1357 sequences did not have any SSR repeats. The most frequent type of repeats was trimeric motif, however the second place was occupied by dimeric motif followed by tetra-, hexa- and penta repeat motifs. The most common dimer repeat motif was GA and in case of trimeric SSRs, it was CGG. The EST sequences of NBS-LRR region of finger millet and rice showed higher synteny and were found on nearly same positions on the rice chromosome map. A total of eight, out of 15 EST based SSR primers were polymorphic among the selected resistant and susceptible finger millet genotypes. The primer FMBLEST5 could able to differentiate them into resistant and susceptible genotypes. The alleles specific to the resistant and susceptible genotypes were sequenced using the ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer and found similarity to NBS-LRR regions of rice and finger millet and contained the characteristic kinase-2 and kinase 3a motifs of plant R-genes belonged to NBS-LRR region. The In-silico and comparative analysis showed that the genes responsible for blast resistance can be identified, mapped and further introgressed through molecular breeding approaches for enhancing the blast resistance in finger millet.
24440828	De novo analysis of the Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) antenna transcriptome and expression patterns of olfactory genes.	2014	Comp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics	We sequenced the antenna transcriptome of the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a global rice pest, and performed transcriptome analysis on BPH antenna. We obtained about 40million 90bp reads that were assembled into 75,874 unigenes with a mean size of 456bp. Among the antenna transcripts, 32,856 (43%) showed significant similarity (E-value <1e(-5)) to known proteins in the NCBI database. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used to classify functions of BPH antenna genes. We identified 10 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), including 7 previously unidentified, and 11 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), including two new members. The expression profiles of 4 OBPs and 2 CSPs were determined by q-PCR for antenna, abdomen, leg and wing of insects of different age, gender, and mating status including two BPH adult wing-morphology types. NlugCSP10 and 4 OBPs appeared to be antenna-specific because they were highly and differentially expressed in male and female antennae. NlugCSP11 was expressed ubiquitously, with particularly high expression in wings. The transcript levels of several olfactory genes depended on adult wing form, age, gender, and mating status, although no clear expression patterns were determined.
24589383	Effect of inoculum sources on the anaerobic digestion of rice straw.	2014	Bioresour Technol	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different inoculum sources on the rice straw anaerobic digestion. Six different digestates (DM, SM, CM, MS, AGS and PS) were applied as inoculums and their effects were evaluated in batch reactors. The results indicated that digested manures were more suitable than sludge. Reactors inoculated with digested manures achieved higher, biogas production and lignocellulose degradation. The better adaptability of digested manures had relationship with its higher cellulase and xylanase activities and sufficient nutrients content. DM had the best effect among all three digested manures. Reactors inoculated with DM achieved the highest biogas production (325.3 mL/g VS) and enzymes activities. The synergism between cellulase and xylanase activities played an important role in lignocellulose degradation.
24667442	Balance between a higher degree of heterosis and increased reproductive isolation: a strategic design for breeding inter-subspecific hybrid rice.	2014	PLoS One	The application of heterosis (hybrid vigor) has brought great success to plant breeding, particularly of hybrid rice, achieving significant yield increases. Attempts to explore the heterosis of inter-subspecific hybrids between indica and japonica rice, which result in even greater yield increases, have greatly increased in the past decades. However, because of the reduced seed setting rate in F1 hybrids as a result of increased reproductive isolation, the application of inter-subspecific hybrids in rice has slowed. Understanding the balance between heterosis and the reproductive isolation of inter-subspecific hybrids will facilitate the strategic design of inter-subspecific hybrid breeding. In this study, five indica and seven japonica rice varieties were chosen as the parental lines of a complete diallel mating design. Data from six group traits from all of the hybrids and inbred lines were collected. We found that the grain weight per plant, grain number per panicle, tiller per plant, thousand grain weight and plant height, which reflected increased heterosis, were associated with the genetic divergence index (GDI) of the parents. Meanwhile, owing to the reduced seed setting rate, which was also associated with the parents' GDI, the grain production of the hybrids was negatively affected. After analyzing the relationships between the GDI of indica-japonica parents and the grain weight per plant of the F1 hybrids, an ideal GDI value (0.37) for the two indica-japonica parents that could provide an optimal balance between the inter-subspecific heterosis and reproductive isolation was proposed. Our findings will help in the strategic design of an inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding program by identifying the ideal indica and japonica parents for a hybrid combination to achieve hybrid rice with an optimal yield. This strategic design of an inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding program will be time saving and cost effective.
24460537	miR444a has multiple functions in the rice nitrate-signaling pathway.	2014	Plant J	Nitrate (NO3-) is a key signaling molecule in plant metabolism and development, in addition to its role as a nutrient. It has been shown previously in Arabidopsis that ANR1, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a major component in the NO3--signaling pathway that triggers lateral root growth and that miR444, which is specific to monocots, targets four genes that are homologous to ANR1 in rice. Here, we show that miR444a plays multiple roles in the rice NO3--signaling pathway - not only in root development, but also involving nitrate accumulation and even Pi -starvation responses. miR444a overexpression resulted in reduced rice lateral root elongation, but promoted rice primary and adventitious root growth, in a nitrate-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of miR444a improved nitrate accumulation and expression of nitrate transporter genes under high nitrate concentration conditions, but reduced the remobilization of nitrate from old leaves to young leaves thus affecting the plant's ability to adapt to nitrogen-limitating conditions. Intriguingly, we found that Pi starvation strongly induced miR444 accumulation in rice roots and that overexpression of miR444a altered Pi -starvation-induced root architecture and enhanced Pi accumulation and expression of three Pi transporter genes. We further provide evidence that miR444a is involved in the interaction between the NO3--signaling and Pi -signaling pathways in rice. Taken together, our observations demonstrated that miR444a plays multiple roles in the rice NO3--signaling pathway in nitrate-dependent root growth, nitrate accumulation and phosphate-starvation responses.
24329817	Cytosolic APX knockdown rice plants sustain photosynthesis by regulation of protein expression related to photochemistry, Calvin cycle and photorespiration.	2014	Physiol Plant	The biochemical mechanisms underlying the involvement of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidases (cAPXs) in photosynthesis are still unknown. In this study, rice plants doubly silenced in these genes (APX1/2) were exposed to moderate light (ML) and high light (HL) to assess the role of cAPXs in photosynthetic efficiency. APX1/2 mutants that were exposed to ML overexpressed seven and five proteins involved in photochemical activity and photorespiration, respectively. These plants also increased the pheophytin and chlorophyll levels, but the amount of five proteins that are important for Calvin cycle did not change. These responses in mutants were associated with Rubisco carboxylation rate, photosystem II (PSII) activity and potential photosynthesis, which were similar to non-transformed plants. The upregulation of photochemical proteins may be part of a compensatory mechanism for APX1/2 deficiency but apparently the finer-control for photosynthesis efficiency is dependent on Calvin cycle proteins. Conversely, under HL the mutants employed a different strategy, triggering downregulation of proteins related to photochemical activity, Calvin cycle and decreasing the levels of photosynthetic pigments. These changes were associated to strong impairment in PSII activity and Rubisco carboxylation. The upregulation of some photorespiratory proteins was maintained under that stressful condition and this response may have contributed to photoprotection in rice plants deficient in cAPXs. The data reveal that the two cAPXs are not essential for photosynthesis in rice or, alternatively, the deficient plants are able to trigger compensatory mechanisms to photosynthetic acclimation under ML and HL conditions. These mechanisms involve differential regulation in protein expression related to photochemistry, Calvin cycle and photorespiration.
24667308	MicroRNA319 positively regulates cold tolerance by targeting OsPCF6 and OsTCP21 in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	PLoS One	The microRNA319 (miR319) family is conserved among diverse plant species. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the miR319 gene family is comprised of two members, Osa-miR319a and Osa-miR319b. We found that overexpressing Osa-miR319b in rice resulted in wider leaf blades and delayed development. Here, we focused on the biological function and potential molecular mechanism of the Osa-miR319b gene in response to cold stress in rice. The expression of Osa-miR319b was down-regulated by cold stress, and the overexpression of Osa-miR319b led to an enhanced tolerance to cold stress, as evidenced by higher survival rates and proline content. Also, the expression of a handful of cold stress responsive genes, such as DREB1A/B/C, DREB2A, TPP1/2, was increased in Osa-miR319b transgenic lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nuclear localization of the transcription factors, OsPCF6 and OsTCP21, which may be Osa-miR319b-targeted genes. We also showed that OsPCF6 and OsTCP21 expression was largely induced by cold stress, and the degree of induction was obviously repressed in plants overexpressing Osa-miR319b. As expected, the down-regulation of OsPCF6 and OsTCP21 resulted in enhanced tolerance to cold stress, partially by modifying active oxygen scavenging. Taken together, our findings suggest that Osa-miR319b plays an important role in plant response to cold stress, maybe by targeting OsPCF6 and OsTCP21.
24398922	Phylogenetic analysis of putative genes involved in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis in rice.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Plant proteome databases were mined for a flavin monooxygenase (YUCCA), tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), nitrilase (NIT), and aldehyde oxidase (AO) enzymes that could be involved in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Phylogenetic trees for enzyme sequences obtained were constructed. The YUCCA and TDC trees showed that these enzymes were conserved across the plant kingdom and therefore could be involved in auxin synthesis. YUCCAs branched into two clades. Most experimentally studied YUCCAs were found in the first clade. The second clade which has representatives from only seed plants contained Arabidopsis sequences linked to embryonic development. Therefore, sequences in this clade were suggested to be evolved with seed development. Examination of TDC activity and expression had previously linked this enzyme to secondary products synthesis. However, the phylogenetic finding of a conserved TDC clade across land plants suggested its essential role in plant growth. Phylogenetic analysis of AOs showed that plants inherited one AO. Recent gene duplication was suggested as AO sequences from each species were similar to each other rather than to AO from other species. Taken together and based on the experimental support of the involvement of AO in abscisic synthesis, AO was excluded as an intermediate in IAA production. Phylogenetic tree for NIT showed that the first clade contained sequences from species across the plant kingdom whereas the second branch contained sequences from only Brassicaceae. Even though NIT4 orthologues were conserved in the second clade, their major role seems to be detoxification of hydrogen cyanide rather than producing IAA.
24505448	Characterisation of four LIM protein-encoding genes involved in infection-related development and pathogenicity by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	PLoS One	LIM domain proteins contain contiguous double-zinc finger domains and play important roles in cytoskeletal re-organisation and organ development in multi-cellular eukaryotes. Here, we report the characterization of four genes encoding LIM proteins in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Targeted gene replacement of either the paxillin-encoding gene, PAX1, or LRG1 resulted in a significant reduction in hyphal growth and loss of pathogenicity, while deletion of RGA1 caused defects in conidiogenesis and appressorium development. A fourth LIM domain gene, LDP1, was not required for infection-associated development by M. oryzae. Live cell imaging revealed that Lrg1-GFP and Rga1-GFP both localize to septal pores, while Pax1-GFP is present in the cytoplasm. To explore the function of individual LIM domains, we carried out systematic deletion of each LIM domain, which revealed the importance of the Lrg1-LIM2 and Lrg1-RhoGAP domains for Lrg1 function and overlapping functions of the three LIM domains of Pax1. Interestingly, deletion of either PAX1 or LRG1 led to decreased sensitivity to cell wall-perturbing agents, such as Congo Red and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated the importance of both Lrg1 and Pax1 to regulation of genes associated with cell wall biogenesis. When considered together, our results indicate that LIM domain proteins are key regulators of infection-associated morphogenesis by the rice blast fungus.
24553786	Heavy metals induce oxidative stress and genome-wide modulation in transcriptome of rice root.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	Industrial growth, ecological disturbances and agricultural practices have contaminated the soil and water with many harmful compounds, including heavy metals. These heavy metals affect growth and development of plants as well as cause severe human health hazards through food chain contamination. In past, studies have been made to identify biochemical and molecular networks associated with heavy metal toxicity and uptake in plants. Studies suggested that most of the physiological and molecular processes affected by different heavy metals are similar to those affected by other abiotic stresses. To identify common and unique responses by different metals, we have studied biochemical and genome-wide modulation in transcriptome of rice (IR-64 cultivar) root after exposure to cadmium (Cd), arsenate [As(V)], lead (Pb) and chromium [Cr(VI)] in hydroponic condition. We observed that root tissue shows variable responses for antioxidant enzyme system for different heavy metals. Genome-wide expression analysis suggests variable number of genes differentially expressed in root in response to As(V), Cd, Pb and Cr(VI) stresses. In addition to unique genes, each heavy metal modulated expression of a large number of common genes. Study also identified cis-acting regions of the promoters which can be determinants for the modulated expression of the genes in response to different heavy metals. Our study advances understanding related to various processes and networks which might be responsible for heavy metal stresses, accumulation and detoxification.
24466124	Selection and evaluation of potential reference genes for gene expression analysis in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR.	2014	PLoS One	The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera, Delphacidae), is one of the most important rice pests. Abundant genetic studies on BPH have been conducted using reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Using qRT-PCR, the expression levels of target genes are calculated on the basis of endogenous controls. These genes need to be appropriately selected by experimentally assessing whether they are stably expressed under different conditions. However, such studies on potential reference genes in N. lugens are lacking. In this paper, we presented a systematic exploration of eight candidate reference genes in N. lugens, namely, actin 1 (ACT), muscle actin (MACT), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), ribosomal protein S15e (RPS15), alpha 2-tubulin (TUB), elongation factor 1 delta (EF), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), and arginine kinase (AK) and used four alternative methods (BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and the delta Ct method) to evaluate the suitability of these genes as endogenous controls. We examined their expression levels among different experimental factors (developmental stage, body part, geographic population, temperature variation, pesticide exposure, diet change, and starvation) following the MIQE (Minimum Information for publication of Quantitative real time PCR Experiments) guidelines. Based on the results of RefFinder, which integrates four currently available major software programs to compare and rank the tested candidate reference genes, RPS15, RPS11, and TUB were found to be the most suitable reference genes in different developmental stages, body parts, and geographic populations, respectively. RPS15 was the most suitable gene under different temperature and diet conditions, while RPS11 was the most suitable gene under different pesticide exposure and starvation conditions. This work sheds light on establishing a standardized qRT-PCR procedure in N. lugens, and serves as a starting point for screening for reference genes for expression studies of related insects.
24686498	Anti-inflammatory effect and prostate gene expression profiling of steryl ferulate on experimental rats with non-bacterial prostatitis.	2014	Food Funct	Steryl ferulate (SF) is a bioactive mixture extracted from rice bran and shows higher inhibitory activity against inflammation than the corresponding free sterols. In this study, the aim was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect and prostate gene expression profiling of SF using a Xiaozhiling-induced non-bacterial prostatitis (NBP) rat model. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by prostate weight, prostate index, acid phosphatase, density of lecithin corpuscles (DLC), white blood cell count (WBC), and prostatic histologic section. Prostate gene expression profiling was assessed by a cDNA microarray and validated by quantitative real-time PCR of five selected genes. Pathway analysis and Gene ontology (GO) analysis were applied to determine the roles of these differentially expressed genes involved in these biological pathways or GO terms. SF treatment could significantly inhibit prostate weight, prostate index, total acid phosphatase, prostatic acid phosphatase and WBC, suppress the severity of histological lesion and increase the DLC. Compared with the control group, the SF treatment group contained 238 up-regulated genes and 111 down-regulated genes. GO analysis demonstrated that the most significant expression genes were closely related to the terms of fibrinolysis, inflammatory response, high-density lipoprotein particle, protein-lipid complex, enzyme inhibitor activity, peptidase inhibitor activity and others. Canonical pathway analysis indicated five pathways were significantly regulated, which were associated with inflammation and tumorgenesis. In conclusion, SF may be used as a health supplement to prevent NBP, in that it could inhibit prostate inflammation in NBP patients by affecting the expression of genes in the related GO terms and pathways.
24507150	Effects of combined amendments on heavy metal accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) planted on contaminated paddy soil.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Stabilization of heavy metals in situ was investigated. Two combined amendments (LS, limestone+sepiolite; HZ, hydroxyhistidine+zeolite) were applied at ratios of 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% (w/w) to paddy soil with multi-metal (Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn) contamination. The effects of these two combined amendments on heavy metal bioavailability in soil, and on uptake and accumulation of heavy metals in rice plants were investigated. Application of LS and HZ significantly increased soil pH values and cation exchange capacity contents, and resulted in a reduction in exchangeable fraction of metals and in extract metal concentrations of amended soils through toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). LS and HZ obviously inhibited uptake and accumulation of Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in rice plants. Compared with the control soil, concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in brown rice were decreased by 10.6-31.8%, 16.7-25.5%, 11.5-22.1%, and 11.7-16.3%, respectively, as a result of 0.2% to 0.8% addition of LS, and decreased by 5.1-40.8%, 16.7-20.0%, 8.1-16.2%, and 13.3-21.7%, respectively, as a result of 0.2-0.8% addition of HZ. Significant positive linear correlations were found between heavy metal concentrations in TCLP extracts and those in rice tissues except for Pb. Extracting heavy metals with TCLP was a more suitable method for estimating heavy metal bioavailability concentrations of amended soil than exchangeable fraction of heavy metals, because the latter underestimated heavy metal bioavailability. These results demonstrate that LS and HZ could be effective in reducing heavy metal bioavailability and accumulation in rice grown on multi-metal-contaminated soils.
24393062	Effects of bentazone on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant systems in human erythrocytes in vitro.	2014	Drug Chem Toxicol	Bentazone, a benzothiadiazole herbicide, is widely used for a variety of crops including cereals, maize, peas, rice and soy beans. The concern for human health is stil very high because bentazone is continuously monitored in environment and several studies to evaluate its potential carcinogenic effects when chronic and high doses were administered to animals. We aimed to investigate the possible effects of bentazone on lipid peroxidation, levels of glutathione and activities of antioxidant enzymes in human erythrocytes in vitro. For that, erythrocyte were incubated with bentazone in different concentrations (0-50 nM) at 37 °C for 1 hr. Bentazone showed significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) at the highest concentration in erythrocytes as an index of lipid peroxidation. Besides, alterations in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were observed while the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) were unchanged. In conclusion, findings from this study indicate that in vitro toxicity of bentazone may be associated with oxidative stress and this work warrants further in vivo investigations.
24398893	Stress-inducible expression of AtDREB1A transcription factor greatly improves drought stress tolerance in transgenic indica rice.	2014	Transgenic Res	The cultivation of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a major food crop, requires ample water (30 % of the fresh water available worldwide), and its productivity is greatly affected by drought, the most significant environmental factor. Much research has focussed on identifying quantitative trait loci, stress-regulated genes and transcription factors that will contribute towards the development of climate-resilient/tolerant crop plants in general and rice in particular. The transcription factor DREB1A, identified from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, has been reported to enhance stress tolerance against drought stress. We developed transgenic rice plants with AtDREB1A in the background of indica rice cultivar Samba Mahsuri through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The AtDREB1A gene was stably inherited and expressed in T1 and T2 plants and in subsequent generations, as indicated by the results of PCR, Southern blot and RT-PCR analyses. Expression of AtDREB1A was induced by drought stress in transgenic rice lines, which were highly tolerant to severe water deficit stress in both the vegetative and reproductive stages without affecting their morphological or agronomic traits. The physiological studies revealed that the expression of AtDREB1A was associated with an increased accumulation of the osmotic substance proline, maintenance of chlorophyll, increased relative water content and decreased ion leakage under drought stress. Most of the homozygous lines were highly tolerant to drought stress and showed significantly a higher grain yield and spikelet fertility relative to the nontransgenic control plants under both stressed and unstressed conditions. The improvement in drought stress tolerance in combination with agronomic traits is very essential in high premium indica rice cultivars, such as Samba Mahsuri, so that farmers can benefit in times of seasonal droughts and water scarcity.
24668487	Genetic diversity and association mapping of seed vigor in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Planta	Seed vigor is closely related to direct seeding in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies for seed vigor were mainly derived from bi-parental segregating populations and no report from natural populations. In this study, association mapping for seed vigor was performed on a selected sample of 540 rice cultivars (419 from China and 121 from Vietnam). Population structure was estimated on the basis of 262 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Seed vigor was evaluated by root length (RL), shoot length (SL) and shoot dry weight in 2011 and 2012. Abundant phenotypic and genetic diversities were found in the studied population. The population was divided into seven subpopulations, and the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) ranged from 10 to 80 cM. We identified 27 marker-trait associations involving 18 SSR markers for three traits. According to phenotypic effects for alleles of the detected QTLs, elite alleles were mined. These elite alleles could be used to design parental combinations and the expected results would be obtained by pyramiding or substituting the elite alleles per QTL (apart from possible epistatic effects). Our results demonstrate that association mapping can complement and enhance previous QTL information for marker-assisted selection and breeding by design.
24720210	[Dynamics of the mineralization and transformation of rice photosynthesized carbon in paddy soils--a batch incubation experiment].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	Photosynthesized carbon is an important part in C cycling of "atmosphere-plant-soil" and is the source of soil organic carbon (SOC), but its mineralization and transformation dynamics in paddy soils remains still unclear. Therefore, a batch incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the mineralization and transformation of rice photosynthesized carbon in paddy soils after rice harvest. The results showed that the mineralization rate of native SOC ranged from 4.44 to 17.8 microg x (g x d)(-1), while that of photosynthesized carbon (new carbon) was 0.15- 1.51 micro x (gx d)(-1) during the course of 100-day-incubation span. Rice photosynthesized carbon input significantly influenced the soil active carbon (DOC, MBC) transformation. During the incubation period (100 d), the amount of 14C-DOC transformation ranged from 1.89 to 5.32 mg x 8 kg(-1), and that of native DOC varied from 61.13 to 90.65 mg x kg(-2), with the transformation rates ranged from 0.18 to 0.34 mg x (kg x d)(-1) and from 4.10 to 5.48 mg. (kg x d)(-1), respectively. However, the 14C-MBC and native original MBC were 10.92-44.11 mg x kg(-1) and 463.31-1153.46 mg x kg(-1), respectively, and their transformation rates were 0.80-2.87, 41.60-74.46 mg x (kg-d)(-1), respectively. It suggested that the turnover of MBC was greater than that of DOC. Furthermore, "new carbon" was easier to be mineralized and decomposed than native SOC. The mineralized portion in "new carbon" was 13.5%-20.2%, whereas that in native SOC was only 2.2%-3.7%. Therefore, we concluded that the incorporation of rice photosynthesized carbon was vital to maintain the soil carbon sink for paddy soils.
24464311	QTL mapping and development of candidate gene-derived DNA markers associated with seedling cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Cold stress at the seedling stage is a major threat to rice production. Cold tolerance is controlled by complex genetic factors. We used an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 123 individuals derived from a cross of the cold-tolerant japonica cultivar Jinbu and the cold-susceptible indica cultivar BR29 for QTL mapping. Phenotypic evaluation of the parents and RILs in an 18/8 °C (day/night) cold stress regime revealed continuous variation for cold tolerance. Six QTLs including two on chromosome 1 and one each on chromosomes 2, 4, 10, and 11 for seedling cold tolerance were identified with phenotypic variation (R(2)) ranging from 6.1 to 16.5 %. The QTL combinations (qSCT1 and qSCT11) were detected in all stable cold-tolerant RIL groups, which explained the critical threshold of 27.1 % for the R(2) value determining cold tolerance at the seedling stage. Two QTLs (qSCT1 and qSCT11) on chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively, were fine mapped. The markers In1-c3, derived from the open reading frame (ORF) LOC_Os01g69910 encoding calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA), and In11-d1, derived from ORF LOC_Os11g37720 (Duf6 gene), co-segregated with seedling cold tolerance. The result may provide useful information on seedling cold tolerance mechanism and provide DNA markers for a marker-assisted breeding program to improve seedling cold tolerance in indica rice varieties.
24290895	Proteomics study of silver nanoparticles toxicity on Bacillus thuringiensis.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Emerging technologies in functional genomics and proteomics provide a way of achieving high-throughput analyses, understanding effects on protein populations and sub-populations and follow up environmental stresses. To accomplish these, the action of homemade spherical Silver nanoparticles colloidal suspension (AgNPs) against Bacillus thuringiensis (isolate from Oryza sativa L. rhizosphere) was investigated by a proteomic approach (2-DE and NanoLC/FT-ICR MS identification). Thirty four responsive (up/down regulated) proteins were identified. Proteomic results revealed that an exposure of B. thuringiensis cells with different concentrations of AgNPs resulted in an accumulation of envelope protein precursors, indicative of the dissipation of a proton motive force. Identified proteins are involved in oxidative stress tolerance, metal detoxification, transcription and elongation processes, protein degradation, cytoskeleton remodeling and cell division. The expression pattern of these proteins and their possible involvement in the nontoxicity mechanisms were discussed.
24487101	A homogeneous immunosensor for AFB1 detection based on FRET between different-sized quantum dots.	2014	Biosens Bioelectron	Mycotoxins are fatal threats in food safety due to their strong carcinogenesis and toxicity, thus requiring highly sensitive detections. Herein, different-sized quantum dots (QDs) were used to construct a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based immunosensor for sensitive detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in rice grains. To avoid irregular aggregation between two kinds of QDs, monovalent monoclonal antibody (mAb)-labeled red QDs (~0.84 anti-AFB1 mAbs per QD) and multivalent hapten-labeled green QDs (~6.8 AFB1 per QD) were designed as acceptor and donor, respectively. The anti-AFB1 mAbs and AFB1 interactions promoted one or more acceptors bound with a multivalent AFB1-labeled donor, resulting in energy transfer from the green QDs to the red QDs. Various parameters that influence the immunoassay including reactant ratio of donor to acceptor, buffer pH value, buffer ionic strength and immunoreaction time were systematically investigated and optimized. With optimal conditions, the obtained energy transfer efficiency is proportional to the logarithm of AFB1 concentration in a range over 0.19-16 pM (0.06-5 ng/mL), while offering a limit of detection of 0.13 pM (0.04 ng/mL) in rice extracts. The recovery rates of the intra-assay for spiked samples at AFB1 concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 ng/mL were 83.27% ± 3.27%, 97.36% ± 4.55% and 83.04% ± 4.94%, respectively, and those for the inter-assay were 81.28% ± 6.11%, 95.97% ± 7.07%, and 82.78% ± 5.99%, respectively. Statistical analysis using t-test had no significant difference between the proposed FRET-based immunoassay and the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
24434156	Interaction with Cu²⁺ disrupts the RNA binding affinities of RNA recognition motif containing protein.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The glycine-rich proteins (GRP) containing RNA recognition motifs (RRM) are involved in the regulation of transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional events. Previous studies have established that GRP162 plays an important role in the restoration of fertility in Honglian cytoplasmic male sterile (HL-CMS) rice. In this study, the ion binding properties of rGRP162 were tested by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to test the interaction. Circular dichroism (CD) was carried out to detect the alteration of secondary structure in the presence and absence of Cu(2+). Furthermore, two RRM containing proteins, AtRBP45A and AtRBP47A, were expressed to validate the interaction. Results showed Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) bound GRP162, whereas Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Mg(2+) and K(+) did not. EMSA confirmed that interaction with Cu(2+) interrupted the biological activity of GRP162 by disrupting the secondary structure of the protein based on the results of CD. Moreover, the RNA binding activities of rAtRBP45A and rAtRBP47A were also impaired in the presence of Cu(2+). Data suggest that Cu(2+) in excess may disrupt RNA-binding proteins containing RRM that are essential for post-transcriptional regulation and may impair the development of plants or animals.
24420930	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3.	2014	Plant Physiol	Trithorax group proteins are chromatin-remodeling factors that activate target gene expression by antagonistically functioning against the Polycomb group. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Arabidopsis Trithorax protein1 (ATX1) regulates flowering time and floral organ identity. Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa). Because the delay occurred only under long-day conditions, we evaluated the flowering signal pathways that specifically function under long-day conditions. Among them, the OsMADS50 and Heading date1 pathways were not affected by the mutation. However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1. Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of Ghd7, were unchanged in the mutant. Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7. We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains. Finally, we showed that the SET domain at the C-terminal end of OsTrx1 has histone H3 methyltransferase activity when incubated with oligonucleosomes. Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure.
24454741	Bioaccumulation of Cry1Ab protein from an herbivore reduces anti-oxidant enzyme activities in two spider species.	2014	PLoS One	Cry proteins are expressed in rice lines for lepidopteran pest control. These proteins can be transferred from transgenic rice plants to non-target arthropods, including planthoppers and then to a predatory spider. Movement of Cry proteins through food webs may reduce fitness of non-target arthropods, although recent publications indicated no serious changes in non-target populations. Nonetheless, Cry protein intoxication influences gene expression in Cry-sensitive insects. We posed the hypothesis that Cry protein intoxication influences enzyme activities in spiders acting in tri-trophic food webs. Here we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to test our hypothesis with two spider species. We demonstrated that the movement of CryAb protein from Drosophila culture medium into fruit flies maintained on the CryAb containing medium and from the flies to the spiders Ummeliata insecticeps and Pardosa pseudoannulata. We also show that the activities of three key metabolic enzymes, acetylcholine esterase (AchE), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly influenced in the spiders after feeding on Cry1Ab-containing fruit flies. We infer from these data that Cry proteins originating in transgenic crops impacts non-target arthropods at the physiological and biochemical levels, which may be one mechanism of Cry protein-related reductions in fitness of non-target beneficial predators.
24617541	Evaluation of seasonal dietary exposure to arsenic, cadmium and lead in schoolchildren through the analysis of meals served by public schools of Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.	2014	J Toxicol Environ Health A	Dietary exposure to arsenic (AS), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) of Brazilian schoolchildren living in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, was assessed. Food samples including rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, and meat served daily by public schools were collected as presented in different seasons. Metallic elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The main sources of As, Cd, and Pb were found to be rice, vegetables, and pork, respectively. Further, in some food types there were seasonal differences in the concentrations of metallic elements. The mean daily intakes of As, Cd, and Pb based upon the association between food consumption data and the observed concentrations of metals in their diet were 6.9 μg, 0.9 μg, and 0.6 μg for As, Cd, and Pb, respectively. These findings are below the toxicological reference values provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
24557889	Molecular cloning, characterization and function analysis of a GDH gene from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in rice.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	The full-length cDNA encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) which catalyzes the reaction of reductive amination of α-oxoglutarate (α-OG) to glutamate (the anabolic activity) and the reverse reaction of oxidative deamination of glutamate (the catabolic activity) was isolated from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, we designated it as SsGDH. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SsGDH had a typical GDH spatial structure and extensive homology with other fungal or bacteria GDHs. To evaluate its function in rice, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. 'kitaake') was transformed with SsGDH in a binary vector construct by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic rice plants showed that transcripts and proteins of SsGDH accumulated at higher levels and GDH enzymatic activity was obviously higher in transgenic rice plants compared with the non-transformant rice plants (CK), though phenotype including plant height, fresh weight and dry weight became slightly weaker compared with CK under 50, 500 and 5,000 μM nitrogen gradient nutrient solution treatment (NH4NO3 as a nitrogen source) after introducing SsGDH into rice. For enzymatic activity assay in vitro, recombinant His6-SsGDH protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA agarose. Results suggested that recombinant His6-SsGDH protein had GDH activity using ammonium, α-OG, and L-glutamate separately as a substrate at two different concentrations, especially the affinity for ammonium was very high, and its Km value was only 0.28 ± 0.03 mM, indicating that SsGDH can assimilate more ammonium into rice. According to previous reports, transgenic plants expressing fungal or bacteria GDHs might show improved herbicide resistance. Basta resistance test showed that SsGDH expression in rice can significantly enhanced their tolerance to Basta than CK. In conclusion, our results may provide some clues for further investigation on nitrogen utilization via introducing exogenous GDHs from lower organisms into rice.
24668677	Characterization of the β-1,3-glucanase gene in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) by cloning and genetic transformation.	2014	Genet Mol Res	Plant β-1,3-glucanases are commonly involved in disease resistance. This report describes the cloning and genetic transformation of a β-1,3-glucanase gene from peanut. The gene was isolated from both the genomic DNA and cDNA of peanut variety Huayu20 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. The DNA sequence contained 1471 bp including two exons and one intron, and the coding sequence contained 1047 bp that coded for a 348-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 38.8 kDa. The sequence was registered in NCBI (GenBank accession No. JQ801335) and was designated as Ah-Glu. As determined by BLAST analysis, the Ah-Glu protein has 42-90% homology with proteins from Oryza sativa (BAC83070.1), Zea mays (NP_001149308), Arabidopsis thaliana (NP_200470.1), Medicago sativa (ABD91577.1), and Glycine max (XP_003530515.1). The over-expression vector pCAMBIA1301-Glu containing Ah-Glu was constructed, confirmed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion, and transformed into peanut variety Huayu22 by Agrobacterium EHA105-mediated transformation. The putative transformed plants (T0) were confirmed by PCR amplification. RT-PCR analysis and β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining showed that the transferred Ah-Glu was expressed as mRNA and protein. In a laboratory test, the transgenic plants were found to be more resistant to the fungal pathogen Cercospora personata than the non-transgenic plants were.
24469585	Isolation, characterization and immunolocalization of a seed dominant CaM from finger millet (Eleusine coracana L. Gartn.) for studying its functional role in differential accumulation of calcium in developing grains.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	To understand the exceptional high grain calcium accumulation in finger millet grains, a calmodulin (CaM) gene that is strongly expressed during developing spikes of high grain calcium genotype was further characterized. Using 5'-3' RACE, the full-length CaM open reading frame (ORF) was isolated and the deduced protein sequence showed the presence of four characteristic EF motifs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the finger millet CaM (Eleusine coracana calmodulin [EcCaM]) was identical to the rice CaM 1-1. Southern hybridization showed the presence of at least four copies of CaM gene that might be located on different regions of the finger millet "AABB" genome. Immunodetection using monospecific polyclonal anti-EcCaM antibodies revealed that EcCaM is localized in the embryo and aleurone layer and accumulates in higher amounts in high grain calcium genotype compared to the low grain calcium genotype. Furthermore, in silico analysis showed that EcCaM interacts with aquaporin which indicates that calcium is probably delivered to developing spike via mass flow of water. These results indicate that higher expression of CaM might cause greater stimulation of the downstream calcium transport machinery operative in the aleurone layer leading to the higher calcium accumulation in the grains of high grain calcium genotype.
24320692	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice.	2014	Plant J	Although grain size is one of the most important components of grain yield, little information is known about the mechanisms that determine final grain size in crops. Here we characterize rice small grain1 (smg1) mutants, which exhibit small and light grains, dense and erect panicles and comparatively slightly shorter plants. The short grain and panicle phenotypes of smg1 mutants are caused by a defect in cell proliferation. The smg1 mutations were identified, using a map-based cloning approach, in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (OsMKK4). Relatively higher expression of OsMKK4/SMG1 was detected in younger organs than in older ones, consistent with its role in cell proliferation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OsMKK4/SMG1 fusion proteins appear to be distributed ubiquitously in plant cells. Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes. Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth.
24615073	Genetic variability among the chloroplast genomes of sugarcane (Saccharum spp) and its wild progenitor species Saccharum spontaneum L.	2014	Genet Mol Res	A striking characteristic of modern sugarcane is that all sugarcane cultivars (Saccharum spp) share a common cytoplasm from S. officinarum. To explore the potential value of S. spontaneum cytoplasm, new Saccharum hybrids with an S. spontaneum cytoplasm were developed at the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, Sugarcane Research Laboratory, through a combination of conventional and molecular breeding approaches. In this study, we analyzed the genetic variability among the chloroplast genomes of four sugarcane cultivars, eight S. spontaneum clones, and three F1 progeny containing an S. spontaneum cytoplasm. Based on the complete chloroplast genome sequence information of two sugarcane cultivars (NCo 310 and SP 80-3280) and five related grass species (barley, maize, rice, sorghum, and wheat), 19 polymerase chain reaction primer pairs were designed targeting various chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) segments with a total length varying from 4781 to 4791 bp. Ten of the 19 cpDNA segments were polymorphic, harboring 14 mutation sites [a 15-nt insertion/deletion (indel), a 5-nt indel, two poly (T) tracts, and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms]. We demonstrate for the first time that the chloroplast genome of S. spontaneum was maternally inherited. Comparative sequence homology analyses clustered sugarcane cultivars into a distinctive group away from S. spontaneum and its progeny. Three mutation sites with a consistent, yet species-specific, nucleotide composition were found, namely, an A/C transversion and two indels. The genetic variability among cpDNA of sugarcane cultivars and S. spontaneum will be useful information to determine the maternal origin in the Saccharum genus.
24469712	Physiological and photosynthetic characteristics of indica Hang2 expressing the sugarcane PEPC gene.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is known to play a key role in the initial fixation of CO2 in C4 photosynthesis. The PEPC gene from sugarcane (a C4 plant) was introduced into indica rice (Hang2), a process mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Integration patterns and copy numbers of the gene was confirmed by DNA blot analysis. RT-PCR and western blotting results showed that the PEPC gene was expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in the transgenic lines. Real-time PCR results indicated that expression of the sugarcane PEPC gene occurred mostly in green tissues and changed under high temperature and drought stress. All transgenic lines showed higher PEPC enzyme activities compared to the untransformed controls, with the highest activity (11.1 times higher than the controls) being observed in the transgenic line, T34. The transgenic lines also exhibited higher photosynthetic rates. The highest photosynthetic rate was observed in the transgenic line, T54 (22.3 μmol m(-2) s(-1); 24.6 % higher than that in non-transgenic plants) under high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, the filled grain and total grain numbers for transgenic lines were higher than those for non-transgenic plants, but the grain filling (%) and 1,000-grain weights of all transgenic lines remained unchanged. We concluded that over-expression of the PEPC gene from sugarcane in indica rice (Hang2) resulted in higher PEPC enzyme activities and higher photosynthesis rates under high-temperature conditions.
24682961	Characterization of RNA binding protein RBP-P reveals a possible role in rice glutelin gene expression and RNA localization.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role in mRNA metabolism including synthesis, maturation, transport, localization, and stability. In developing rice seeds, RNAs that code for the major storage proteins are transported to specific domains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a regulated mechanism requiring RNA cis-localization elements, or zipcodes. Putative trans-acting RBPs that recognize prolamine RNA zipcodes required for restricted localization to protein body-ER have previously been identified. Here, we describe the identification of RBP-P using a Northwestern blot approach as an RBP that recognizes and binds to glutelin zipcode RNA, which is required for proper RNA localization to cisternal-ER. RBP-P protein expression coincides with that of glutelin during seed maturation and is localized to both the nucleus and cytosol. RNA-immunoprecipitation and subsequent RT-PCR analysis further demonstrated that RBP-P interacts with glutelin RNAs. In vitro RNA-protein UV-crosslinking assays showed that recombinant RBP-P binds strongly to glutelin mRNA, and in particular, 3' UTR and zipcode RNA. RBP-P also exhibited strong binding activity to a glutelin intron sequence, suggesting that RBP-P might participate in mRNA splicing. Overall, these results support a multifunctional role for RBP-P in glutelin mRNA metabolism, perhaps in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and cytosolic localization to the cisternal-ER.
24596173	Strigolactones are involved in phosphate- and nitrate-deficiency-induced root development and auxin transport in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	Strigolactones (SLs) or their derivatives have recently been defined as novel phytohormones that regulate root development. However, it remains unclear whether SLs mediate root growth in response to phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) deficiency. In this study, the responses of root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) to different levels of phosphate and nitrate supply were investigated using wild type (WT) and mutants defective in SL synthesis (d10 and d27) or insensitive to SL (d3). Reduced concentration of either phosphate or nitrate led to increased seminal root length and decreased lateral root density in WT. Limitation of either P or N stimulated SL production and enhanced expression of D10, D17, and D27 and suppressed expression of D3 and D14 in WT roots. Mutation of D10, D27, or D3 caused loss of sensitivity of root response to P and N deficiency. Application of the SL analogue GR24 restored seminal root length and lateral root density in WT and d10 and d27 mutants but not in the d3 mutant, suggesting that SLs were induced by nutrient-limiting conditions and led to changes in rice root growth via D3. Moreover, P or N deficiency or GR24 application reduced the transport of radiolabelled indole-3-acetic acid and the activity of DR5::GUS auxin reporter in WT and d10 and d27 mutants. These findings highlight the role of SLs in regulating rice root development under phosphate and nitrate limitation. The mechanisms underlying this regulatory role involve D3 and modulation of auxin transport from shoots to roots.
24397480	Identification and characterization of CBL and CIPK gene families in canola (Brassica napus L.).	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Canola (Brassica napus L.) is one of the most important oil-producing crops in China and worldwide. The yield and quality of canola is frequently threatened by environmental stresses including drought, cold and high salinity. Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular secondary messenger in plants. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) are Ca2+ sensors and regulate a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases called CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Although the CBL-CIPK network has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in plant development and responses to various environmental stresses in Arabidopsis, little is known about their function in canola.

RESULTS: In the present study, we identified seven CBL and 23 CIPK genes from canola by database mining and cloning of cDNA sequences of six CBLs and 17 CIPKs. Phylogenetic analysis of CBL and CIPK gene families across a variety of species suggested genome duplication and diversification. The subcellular localization of three BnaCBLs and two BnaCIPKs were determined using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as the reporter. We also demonstrated interactions between six BnaCBLs and 17 BnaCIPKs using yeast two-hybrid assay, and a subset of interactions were further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Furthermore, the expression levels of six selected BnaCBL and 12 BnaCIPK genes in response to salt, drought, cold, heat, ABA, methyl viologen (MV) and low potassium were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and these CBL or CIPK genes were found to respond to multiple stimuli, suggesting that the canola CBL-CIPK network may be a point of convergence for several different signaling pathways. We also performed a comparison of interaction patterns and expression profiles of CBL and CIPK in Arabidospsis, canola and rice, to examine the differences between orthologs, highlighting the importance of studying CBL-CIPK in canola as a prerequisite for improvement of this crop.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CBL and CIPK family members may form a dynamic complex to respond to different abiotic or hormone signaling. Our comparative analyses of the CBL-CIPK network between canola, Arabidopsis and rice highlight functional differences and the necessity to study CBL-CIPK gene functions in canola. Our data constitute a valuable resource for CBL and CPK genomics.
24599000	Quantitative trait locus mapping and candidate gene analysis for plant architecture traits using whole genome re-sequencing in rice.	2014	Mol Cells	Plant breeders have focused on improving plant architecture as an effective means to increase crop yield. Here, we identify the main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for plant shape-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa) and find candidate genes by applying whole genome re-sequencing of two parental cultivars using next-generation sequencing. To identify QTLs influencing plant shape, we analyzed six traits: plant height, tiller number, panicle diameter, panicle length, flag leaf length, and flag leaf width. We performed QTL analysis with 178 F7 recombinant in-bred lines (RILs) from a cross of japonica rice line 'SNUSG1' and indica rice line 'Milyang23'. Using 131 molecular markers, including 28 insertion/deletion markers, we identified 11 main- and 16 minor-effect QTLs for the six traits with a threshold LOD value > 2.8. Our sequence analysis identified fifty-four candidate genes for the main-effect QTLs. By further comparison of coding sequences and meta-expression profiles between japonica and indica rice varieties, we finally chose 15 strong candidate genes for the 11 main-effect QTLs. Our study shows that the whole-genome sequence data substantially enhanced the efficiency of polymorphic marker development for QTL fine-mapping and the identification of possible candidate genes. This yields useful genetic resources for breeding high-yielding rice cultivars with improved plant architecture.
24531269	Understanding the paradox of selenium contamination in mercury mining areas: high soil content and low accumulation in rice.	2014	Environ Pollut	Rice is an important source of Se for billions of people throughout the world. The Wanshan area can be categorized as a seleniferous region due to its high soil Se content, but the Se content in the rice in Wanshan is much lower than that from typical seleniferous regions with an equivalent soil Se level. To investigate why the Se bioaccumulation in Wanshan is low, we measured the soil Se speciation using a sequential partial dissolution technique. The results demonstrated that the bioavailable species only accounted for a small proportion of the total Se in the soils from Wanshan, a much lower quantity than that found in the seleniferous regions. The potential mechanisms may be associated with the existence of Hg contamination, which is likely related to the formation of an inert Hg-Se insoluble precipitate in soils in Wanshan.
24588812	Silicon nutrition alleviates the negative impacts of arsenic on the photosynthetic apparatus of rice leaves: an analysis of the key limitations of photosynthesis.	2014	Physiol Plant	Silicon (Si) plays important roles in alleviating various abiotic stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), arsenic (As) is believed to share the Si transport pathway for entry into roots, and Si has been demonstrated to decrease As concentrations. However, the physiological mechanisms through which Si might alleviate As toxicity in plants remain poorly elucidated. We combined detailed gas exchange measurements with chlorophyll fluorescence analysis to examine the effects of Si nutrition on photosynthetic performance in rice plants [a wild-type (WT) cultivar and its lsi1 mutant defective in Si uptake] challenged with As (arsenite). As treatment impaired carbon fixation (particularly in the WT genotype) that was unrelated to photochemical or biochemical limitations but, rather, was largely associated with decreased leaf conductance at the stomata and mesophyll levels. Indeed, regardless of the genotypes, in the plants challenged with As, photosynthetic rates correlated strongly with both stomatal (r(2)  = 0.90) and mesophyll (r(2)  = 0.95) conductances, and these conductances were, in turn, linearly correlated with each other. The As-related impairments to carbon fixation could be considerably reverted by Si in a time- and genotype-dependent manner. In conclusion, we identified Si nutrition as an important target in an attempt to not only decrease As concentrations but also to ameliorate the photosynthetic performance of rice plants challenged with As.
24654985	The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes.	2014	Plant J	Auxin is a fundamental plant hormone and its localization within organs plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development. Analysis of many Arabidopsis mutants that were defective in auxin biosynthesis revealed that the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway, catalyzed by the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA) and YUCCA (YUC) families, is the major biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). In contrast, little information is known about the molecular mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis in rice. In this study, we identified a auxin-related rice mutant, fish bone (fib). FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels. Moreover, we found that auxin sensitivity and polar transport activity were altered in the fib mutant. From these results, we suggest that FIB plays a pivotal role in IAA biosynthesis in rice and that auxin biosynthesis, transport and sensitivity are closely interrelated.
24701196	Effects of different mineral admixtures on the properties of fresh concrete.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	This paper presents a review of the properties of fresh concrete including workability, heat of hydration, setting time, bleeding, and reactivity by using mineral admixtures fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), metakaolin (MK), and rice husk ash (RHA). Comparison of normal and high-strength concrete in which cement has been partially supplemented by mineral admixture has been considered. It has been concluded that mineral admixtures may be categorized into two groups: chemically active mineral admixtures and microfiller mineral admixtures. Chemically active mineral admixtures decrease workability and setting time of concrete but increase the heat of hydration and reactivity. On the other hand, microfiller mineral admixtures increase workability and setting time of concrete but decrease the heat of hydration and reactivity. In general, small particle size and higher specific surface area of mineral admixture are favourable to produce highly dense and impermeable concrete; however, they cause low workability and demand more water which may be offset by adding effective superplasticizer.
24688443	Mechanical characteristics of hardened concrete with different mineral admixtures: a review.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	The available literature identifies that the addition of mineral admixture as partial replacement of cement improves the microstructure of the concrete (i.e., porosity and pore size distribution) as well as increasing the mechanical characteristics such as drying shrinkage and creep, compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity; however, no single document is available in which review and comparison of the influence of the addition of these mineral admixtures on the mechanical characteristics of the hardened pozzolanic concretes are presented. In this paper, based on the reported results in the literature, mechanical characteristics of hardened concrete partially containing mineral admixtures including fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), metakaolin (MK), and rice husk ash (RHA) are discussed and it is concluded that the content and particle size of mineral admixture are the parameters which significantly influence the mechanical properties of concrete. All mineral admixtures enhance the mechanical properties of concrete except FA and GGBS which do not show a significant effect on the strength of concrete at 28 days; however, gain in strength at later ages is considerable. Moreover, the comparison of the mechanical characteristics of different pozzolanic concretes suggests that RHA and SF are competitive.
24705135	Activity levels and expression of antioxidant enzymes in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle in artificially aged rice seed.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Reactive oxygen species are the main contributors to seed deterioration. In order to study scavenging systems for reactive oxygen species in aged seed, we performed analyses using western blotting, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, high-performance liquid chromatography, and antioxidant enzyme activity analyses in artificially aged rice seeds (Oryza sativa L. cv. wanhua no.11). Aging seeds by storing them at 50 °C for 1, 9, or 17 months increased the superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide levels and reduced the germination percentage from 99% to 92%, 55%, and 2%, respectively. The activity levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) did not change in aged seeds. In contrast, the activity levels of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) were significantly decreased in aged seeds, as were the expression of catalase and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase protein. Transcript accumulation analysis showed that specific expression patterns were complex for each of the antioxidant enzyme types in the rice embryos. Overall, the expression of most genes was down-regulated, along with their protein expression. In addition, the reduction in the amount of ascorbate and glutathione was associated with the reduction in scavenging enzymes activity in aged rice embryos. Our data suggest that the depression of the antioxidant system, especially the reduction in the expression of CAT1, APX1 and MDHAR1, may be responsible for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in artificially aged seed embryos, leading to a loss of seed vigor.
24699514	Identification of differentially expressed proteins and phosphorylated proteins in rice seedlings in response to strigolactone treatment.	2014	PLoS One	Strigolactones (SLs) are recently identified plant hormones that inhibit shoot branching and control various aspects of plant growth, development and interaction with parasites. Previous studies have shown that plant D10 protein is a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase that functions in SL biosynthesis. In this work, we used an allelic SL-deficient d10 mutant XJC of rice (Oryza sativa L. spp. indica) to investigate proteins that were responsive to SL treatment. When grown in darkness, d10 mutant seedlings exhibited elongated mesocotyl that could be rescued by exogenous application of SLs. Soluble protein extracts were prepared from d10 mutant seedlings grown in darkness in the presence of GR24, a synthetic SL analog. Soluble proteins were separated on two-dimensional gels and subjected to proteomic analysis. Proteins that were expressed differentially and phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation status changed in response to GR24 treatment were identified. Eight proteins were found to be induced or down-regulated by GR24, and a different set of 8 phosphoproteins were shown to change their phosphorylation intensities in the dark-grown d10 seedlings in response to GR24 treatment. Analysis of these proteins revealed that they are important enzymes of the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways and key components of the cellular energy generation machinery. These proteins may represent potential targets of the SL signaling pathway. This study provides new insight into the complex and negative regulatory mechanism by which SLs control shoot branching and plant development.
24614245	A pepper MSRB2 gene confers drought tolerance in rice through the protection of chloroplast-targeted genes.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The perturbation of the steady state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to biotic and abiotic stresses in a plant could lead to protein denaturation through the modification of amino acid residues, including the oxidation of methionine residues. Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to the methionine residue. To assess the role of this enzyme, we generated transgenic rice using a pepper CaMSRB2 gene under the control of the rice Rab21 (responsive to ABA protein 21) promoter with/without a selection marker, the bar gene.

RESULTS: A drought resistance test on transgenic plants showed that CaMSRB2 confers drought tolerance to rice, as evidenced by less oxidative stress symptoms and a strengthened PSII quantum yield under stress conditions, and increased survival rate and chlorophyll index after the re-watering. The results from immunoblotting using a methionine sulfoxide antibody and nano-LC-MS/MS spectrometry suggest that porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which is involved in chlorophyll synthesis, is a putative target of CaMSRB2. The oxidized methionine content of PBGD expressed in E. coli increased in the presence of H2O2, and the Met-95 and Met-227 residues of PBGD were reduced by CaMSRB2 in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). An expression profiling analysis of the overexpression lines also suggested that photosystems are less severely affected by drought stress.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CaMSRB2 might play an important functional role in chloroplasts for conferring drought stress tolerance in rice.
24549238	An ionic liquid tolerant cellulase derived from chemically polluted microhabitats and its application in in situ saccharification of rice straw.	2014	Bioresour Technol	A cellulase-producing fungus was isolated from chemically polluted microhabitats by [Amim][Cl] enrichment and identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The maximum activity of the cellulase in 30% (v/v) ionic liquids (ILs) was detected in [Emim][DMP], [Amim][Cl] and [Emim][MA] as 127%, 111% and 109%, respectively, of its activity in buffer, suggesting its superior performance in high concentration ILs. Strikingly, although its initial activity varied in each IL, its half-life was longer in most ILs than in buffer, evidence of a high conformational stability of the enzyme that is essential for maintaining the remaining activity in relevant media. It noteworthy that 1-3M NaCl can activate the cellulase somewhat. More gratifyingly, a compatible IL-cellulase system based on the cellulase was developed, and its use significantly improved the saccharification rate of rice straw from 53% to 88% versus the control, demonstrating its potential for efficient transformation of lignocellulose to glucose in a single-step process.
24631338	Anti-inflammatory effect of tricin 4'-O-(threo-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether, a novel flavonolignan compound isolated from Njavara on in RAW264.7 cells and in ear mice edema.	2014	Toxicol Appl Pharmacol	Although recent study has shown tricin 4'-O-(threo-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether (TTGE), an isolated compound from Njavara rice, to have the most potent anti-inflammatory effects, the action mechanism has not been fully understood. Here, we examined the effect of TTGE on the inflammation and elucidated the potential mechanism. We demonstrated that TTGE significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO and ROS generation in RAW264.7 cells, which was correlated with the down-regulating effect of TTGE on the iNOS and COX-2 expression via NF-κB and STAT3. TPA-induced ear edema was also efficiently inhibited by the TTGE treatment. TTGE blocked the induction of iNOS and COX-2 through the regulation of NF-κB and STAT3, which could explain the reduced TPA-induced edema symptoms. Moreover, the introduction of ERK inhibitor abrogated the anti-inflammatory effect of TTGE via the recovery of NF-κB and STAT3 signalings. Taken together, these results suggest that TTGE has anti-inflammatory properties through down-regulation of NF-κB and STAT3 pathways.
24550897	Suppression of cell wall-related genes associated with stunting of Oryza glaberrima infected with Rice tungro spherical virus.	2014	Front Microbiol	Rice tungro disease is a complex disease caused by the interaction between Rice tungro bacilliform virus and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV). RTSV alone does not cause recognizable symptoms in most Asian rice (Oryza sativa) plants, whereas some African rice (O. glaberrima) plants were found to become stunted by RTSV. Stunting of rice plants by virus infections usually accompanies the suppression of various cell wall-related genes. The expression of cell wall-related genes was examined in O. glaberrima and O. sativa infected with RTSV to see the relationship between the severity of stunting and the suppression of cell wall-related genes by RTSV. The heights of four accessions of O. glaberrima were found to decline by 14-34% at 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) with RTSV, whereas the height reduction of O. sativa plants by RTSV was not significant. RTSV accumulated more in O. glaberrima plants than in O. sativa plants, but the level of RTSV accumulation was not correlated with the degree of height reduction among the four accessions of O. glaberrima. Examination for expression of genes for cellulose synthase A5 (CESA5) and A6 (CESA6), cellulose synthase-like A9 (CSLA9) and C7, and α-expansin 1 (expansin 1) and 15 precursors in O. glaberrima and O. sativa plants between 7 and 28 dpi with RTSV showed that the genes such as those for CESA5, CESA6, CSLA9, and expansin 1were more significantly suppressed in stunted plants of O. glaberrima at 14 dpi with RTSV than in O. sativa, suggesting that stunting of O. glaberrima might be associated with these cell wall-related genes suppressed by RTSV. Examination for expression of these genes in O. sativa plants infected with other rice viruses in previous studies indicated that the suppression of the expansin 1 gene is likely to be a signature response commonly associated with virus-induced stunting of Oryza species. These results suggest that stunting of O. glaberrima by RTSV infection might be associated with the suppression of these cell wall-related genes at the early stage of infection with RTSV.
24275521	Phylogenetic analysis reveals conservation and diversification of micro RNA166 genes among diverse plant species.	2014	Genomics	Similar to the majority of the microRNAs, mature miR166s are derived from multiple members of MIR166 genes (precursors) and regulate various aspects of plant development by negatively regulating their target genes (Class III HD-ZIP). The evolutionary conservation or functional diversification of miRNA166 family members remains elusive. Here, we show the phylogenetic relationships among MIR166 precursor and mature sequences from three diverse model plant species. Despite strong conservation, some mature miR166 sequences, such as ppt-miR166m, have undergone sequence variation. Critical sequence variation in ppt-miR166m has led to functional diversification, as it targets non-HD-ZIPIII gene transcript (s). MIR166 precursor sequences have diverged in a lineage specific manner, and both precursors and mature osa-miR166i/j are highly conserved. Interestingly, polycistronic MIR166s were present in Physcomitrella and Oryza but not in Arabidopsis. The nature of cis-regulatory motifs on the upstream promoter sequences of MIR166 genes indicates their possible contribution to the functional variation observed among miR166 species.
24354293	Speciation without chromatography using selective hydride generation: inorganic arsenic in rice and samples of marine origin.	2014	Anal Chem	Because of the toxicity of inorganic arsenic (iAs), only iAs needs to be monitored in food and feedstuff. This demands the development of easy and quick analytical methods to screen large number of samples. This work focuses on hydride generation (HG) coupled with an ICPMS as an arsenic detector where the HG is added as a selective step to determine iAs in the gaseous phase while organically bound As remains in the solution. iAs forms volatile arsine species with high efficiency when treated with NaBH4 at acidic conditions, whereas most other organoarsenic compounds do not form any or only less volatile arsines. Additionally, using high concentrations of HCl further reduces the production of the less volatile arsines and iAs is almost exclusively formed, therefore enabling to measure iAs without a prior step of species separation using chromatography. Here, we coupled a commercially available HG system to an ICPMS and optimized for determination of iAs in rice and samples of marine origin using different acid concentrations, wet and dry plasma conditions, and different reaction gas modes. Comparing this method to conventional HPLC-ICPMS, no statistical difference in iAs concentration was found and comparable limits of detections were achieved using less than half the instrument time.
24674921	OsATG7 is required for autophagy-dependent lipid metabolism in rice postmeiotic anther development.	2014	Autophagy	In flowering plants, the tapetum, the innermost layer of the anther, provides both nutrient and lipid components to developing microspores, pollen grains, and the pollen coat. Though the programmed cell death of the tapetum is one of the most critical and sensitive steps for fertility and is affected by various environmental stresses, its regulatory mechanisms remain mostly unknown. Here we show that autophagy is required for the metabolic regulation and nutrient supply in anthers and that autophagic degradation within tapetum cells is essential for postmeiotic anther development in rice. Autophagosome-like structures and several vacuole-enclosed lipid bodies were observed in postmeiotic tapetum cells specifically at the uninucleate stage during pollen development, which were completely abolished in a retrotransposon-insertional OsATG7 (autophagy-related 7)-knockout mutant defective in autophagy, suggesting that autophagy is induced in tapetum cells. Surprisingly, the mutant showed complete sporophytic male sterility, failed to accumulate lipidic and starch components in pollen grains at the flowering stage, showed reduced pollen germination activity, and had limited anther dehiscence. Lipidomic analyses suggested impairment of editing of phosphatidylcholines and lipid desaturation in the mutant during pollen maturation. These results indicate a critical involvement of autophagy in a reproductive developmental process of rice, and shed light on the novel autophagy-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism in eukaryotic cells.
24595535	Enhanced production of reducing sugars from transgenic rice expressing exo-glucanase under the control of a senescence-inducible promoter.	2014	Transgenic Res	We generated transgenic rice plants that express EXG1 exo-glucanase under the control of a senescence-inducible promoter. When a GUS coding sequence was connected to a promoter region of STAY GREEN (SGR) gene of rice and introduced into rice, GUS activity was specifically observed along with senescence. When an EXG1 cDNA was connected to the SGR promoter and introduced into rice, higher cellulase activities were detected after senescence. The EXG1 transgenic plants showed enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiencies after senescence, but no significant difference of saccharification efficiencies was observed before senescence. The saccharification efficiencies were correlated with the cellulase activities in the transgenic plants. The EXG1 transgenic plants showed neither morphological abnormality nor sterility, both of which were observed when EXG1 was constitutively overexpressed. These results indicate that expression of cell wall degrading enzymes such as cellulase by a senescence-inducible promoter is one of the ways to enhance the saccharification ability of cellulosic biomass without affecting plant growth for efficient production of biofuels.
24618677	Will climate change affect outbreak patterns of planthoppers in Bangladesh?	2014	PLoS One	Recently, planthoppers outbreaks have intensified across Asia resulting in heavy rice yield losses. The problem has been widely reported as being induced by insecticides while other factors such as global warming that could be potential drivers have been neglected. Here, we speculate that global warming may increase outbreak risk of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål.). We present data that demonstrate the relationship between climate variables (air temperature and precipitation) and the abundance of brown planthopper (BPH) during 1998-2007. Data show that BPH has become significantly more abundant in April over the 10-year period, but our data do not indicate that this is due to a change in climate, as no significant time trends in temperature and precipitation could be demonstrated. The abundance of BPH varied considerably between months within a year which is attributed to seasonal factors, including the availability of suitable host plants. On the other hand, the variation within months is attributed to fluctuations in monthly temperature and precipitation among years. The effects of these weather variables on BPH abundance were analyzed statistically by a general linear model. The statistical model shows that the expected effect of increasing temperatures is ambiguous and interacts with the amount of rainfall. According to the model, months or areas characterized by a climate that is either cold and dry or hot and wet are likely to experience higher levels of BPH due to climate change, whereas other combinations of temperature and rainfall may reduce the abundance of BPH. The analysis indicates that global warming may have contributed to the recent outbreaks of BPH in some rice growing areas of Asia, and that the severity of such outbreaks is likely to increase if climate change exaggerates. Our study highlights the need to consider climate change when designing strategies to manage planthoppers outbreaks.
24033343	Chromium stress response effect on signal transduction and expression of signaling genes in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a non-essential metal for normal plants and is toxic to plants at high concentrations. However, signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of its action on cell function and gene expression remain elusive. In this study, we found that Cr(VI) induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and Ca(2+) accumulation and activated NADPH oxidase and calcium-dependent protein kinase. We investigated global transcriptional changes in rice roots by microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling indicated activation of abscisic acid-, ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated signaling and inactivation of gibberellic acid-related pathways in Cr(VI) stress-treated rice roots. Genes encoding signaling components such as the protein kinases domain of unknown function 26, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, LRK10-like kinase type 2 and protein phosphatase 2C, as well as transcription factors WRKY and apetala2/ethylene response factor were predominant during Cr(VI) stress. Genes involved in vesicle trafficking were subjected to functional characterization. Pretreating rice roots with a vesicle trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A, effectively reduced Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Suppression of the vesicle trafficking gene, Exo70, by virus-induced gene silencing strategies revealed that vesicle trafficking is required for mediation of Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation in response to Cr stress in plants.
24507130	Carbofuran promotes biochemical changes in carp exposed to rice field and laboratory conditions.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Effects of carbofuran commercial formulation on oxidative stress parameters were studied in carps (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to 50µg/L for 7 and 30 days under rice field and laboratory conditions. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were increased in the brain of fish after 7 and 30 days under rice field and laboratory conditions. In the liver and muscle, TBARS levels increased after 7 and 30 days under laboratory conditions, whereas in rice field the levels increased only after 30 days. Protein carbonyl content in the liver increased after 7 and 30 days under both experimental conditions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was decreased in the brain and muscle after 7 and 30 days under both experimental conditions evaluated. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in the liver after 7 and 30 days under rice field condition, whereas under laboratory condition this enzyme increased only after 30 days. The catalase (CAT) activity in the liver decreased after 30 days under rice field condition, whereas no changes were observed under laboratory conditions. In rice field, glutathione S-transferase (GST) decreased after 7 days but increased after 30 days, whereas no change was observed in fish exposed to carbofuran under laboratory conditions. These results suggest that environmental relevant carbofuran concentrations may cause oxidative stress, affecting biochemical and enzymatic parameters on carps. Some parameters could be used as biomarkers to carbofuran exposure.
24520898	StoS, a hybrid histidine kinase sensor of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is activated by sensing low O₂ concentration and is involved in stress tolerance and virulence.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Bacteria have two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTS), which are important devices for receiving various environmental signals. A TCSTS generally consists of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) that contains a receiver domain. There are also hybrid-type HK (HyHK) that comprise a HK with a receiver domain within one molecule. In this study, we show that the deletion mutant of a HyHK XOO_0635 (StoS) of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight of rice, had decreased stress tolerance to high osmolarity, sodium, and H₂O₂. Growth of the StoS mutant was delayed, and viability was lower than the wild type in medium and in rice leaves. We found that StoS regulates the expression of various genes including XOO_3715, XOO_0131, and stoS itself. A domain search revealed a PAS domain with a heme pocket in StoS, implying that the HyHK functions as an O₂ sensor. When the bacteria were incubated in low oxygen, the StoS-dependent expression of XOO_0131 and XOO_3715 became higher. Therefore, StoS is activated by sensing a low O2 concentration in its environs and is involved in gene expression for adapting to various stressful conditions.
24456138	Rice MtN3/saliva/SWEET gene family: Evolution, expression profiling, and sugar transport.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	The rice MtN3/saliva/SWEET gene family consists of 21 paralogs. However, their functions in physiological processes are largely unknown, although at least three of the 21 paralogs are used by pathogenic bacteria to infect rice. Here, we report the evolutionary features, transcriptional characteristics, and putative functions in sugar transport of this gene family. The wild rice accessions in this study included those with AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, and GG genomes, which appeared approximately 0.58-14.6 million years ago. The structures, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, and homologous distribution among the accessions suggest that the number of rice MtN3/saliva/SWEET paralogs gradually increased as the Oryza genus evolved, and one third of the paralogs may have originated recently. These paralogs are differentially expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues, in the leaf senescence process, and in signaling dependent on gibberellic acid, cytokinin, or 1-naphthalene acetic acid (an analog of auxin), suggesting that they may be associated with multiple physiological processes. Four paralogs could transport galactose in yeast, which suggests that they may have a similar function in rice. These results will help to elucidate their roles and biochemical functions in rice development, adaptation to environment, host-pathogen interaction, and so forth.
24384682	Rice, bread, noodle and cereal intake and colorectal cancer in Japanese men and women: the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective Study (JPHC Study).	2014	Br J Cancer	BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate increased rapidly in Japan between the 1950s and 1990s. We examined the association between rice intake and CRC risk in comparison with bread, noodles and cereal among Japanese adults enrolled in the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective Study.

METHODS: A total of 73,501 Japanese men and women were followed-up from 1995 to 1999 until the end of 2008 for an average of 11 years. During 801,937 person-years of follow-up, we identified 1276 incident cases of CRC. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CRC for rice, noodle, bread and cereal intake were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.

RESULTS: Overall, no significant association was observed for the highest quartile of rice intake compared with the lowest and the risk of CRC and its subsites in men (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.56-1.07) and women (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.71-1.68). However, a non-significant inverse trend was observed between rice intake and rectal cancer in men. No clear patterns of association were observed in bread, noodle and cereal intake.

CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the consumption of rice does not have a substantial impact on the risk of CRC in the Japanese population.
24389480	In vivo hair growth-promoting effect of rice bran extract prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide fluid.	2014	Biol Pharm Bull	The potential hair growth-promoting activity of rice bran supercritical CO2 extract (RB-SCE) and major components of RB-SCE, linoleic acid, policosanol, γ-oryzanol, and γ-tocotrienol, were evaluated with the histological morphology and mRNA expression levels of cell growth factors using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in C57BL/6 mice. RB-SCE showed hair growth-promoting potential to a similar extent as 3% minoxidil, showing that the hair follicles were induced to be in the anagen stage. The numbers of the hair follicles were significantly increased. In addition, mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) were also significantly increased and that of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) decreased in RB-SCE-treated groups. Among the major components of RB-SCE, linoleic acid and γ-oryzanol induced the formation of hair follicles according to examination of histological morphology and mRNA expression levels of cell growth factors. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RB-SCE, particularly linoleic acid and γ-oryzanol, promotes hair growth and suggests RB-SCE can be applied as hair loss treatment.
24533099	Transcriptome analysis of fat bodies from two brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) populations with different virulence levels in rice.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), one of the most serious rice insect pests in Asia, can quickly overcome rice resistance by evolving new virulent populations. The insect fat body plays essential roles in the life cycles of insects and in plant-insect interactions. However, whether differences in fat body transcriptomes exist between insect populations with different virulence levels and whether the transcriptomic differences are related to insect virulence remain largely unknown.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we performed transcriptome-wide analyses on the fat bodies of two BPH populations with different virulence levels in rice. The populations were derived from rice variety TN1 (TN1 population) and Mudgo (M population). In total, 33,776 and 32,332 unigenes from the fat bodies of TN1 and M populations, respectively, were generated using Illumina technology. Gene ontology annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology classifications indicated that genes related to metabolism and immunity were significantly active in the fat bodies. In addition, a total of 339 unigenes showed homology to genes of yeast-like symbionts (YLSs) from 12 genera and endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. A comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated 7,860 differentially expressed genes. GO annotations and enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways indicated these differentially expressed transcripts might be involved in metabolism and immunity. Finally, 105 differentially expressed genes from YLSs and Wolbachia were identified, genes which might be associated with the formation of different virulent populations.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study was the first to compare the fat-body transcriptomes of two BPH populations having different virulence traits and to find genes that may be related to this difference. Our findings provide a molecular resource for future investigations of fat bodies and will be useful in examining the interactions between the fat body and virulence variation in the BPH.
24433542	The karrikin response system of Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant J	Arabidopsis thaliana provides a powerful means to investigate the mode of action of karrikins, compounds produced during wildfires that stimulate germination of seeds of fire-following taxa. These studies have revealed close parallels between karrikin signalling and strigolactone signalling. The two perception systems employ similar mechanisms involving closely related α/β-fold hydrolases (KAI2 and AtD14) and a common F-box protein (MAX2). However, karrikins and strigolactones may be distinguished from each other and elicit different responses. The karrikin response requires a newly discovered protein (SMAX1), a homologue of rice protein D53 that is required for the strigolactone response. Mutants defective in the response to karrikins have seeds with increased dormancy, altered seedling photomorphogenesis and modified leaf shape. As the karrikin and strigolactone response mechanisms are so similar, it is speculated that the endogenous signalling compound for the KAI2 system may be a specific strigolactone. However, new results show that the proposed endogenous signalling compound is not produced by the known strigolactone biosynthesis pathway via carlactone. Structural studies of KAI2 protein and its interaction with karrikins and strigolactone analogues provide some insight into possible protein-ligand interactions, but are hampered by lack of knowledge of the endogenous ligand. The KAI2 system appears to be present throughout angiosperms, implying a fundamentally important function in plant biology.
24586663	Phylogeny and molecular evolution analysis of PIN-FORMED 1 in angiosperm.	2014	PLoS One	PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) is an important secondary transporter and determines the direction of intercellular auxin flow. As PIN1 performs the conserved function of auxin transport, it is expected that the sequence and structure of PIN1 is conserved. Therefore, we hypothesized that PIN1 evolve under pervasive purifying selection in the protein-coding sequences in angiosperm. To test this hypothesis, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses of 67 PIN1 sequences from 35 angiosperm species. We found that the PIN1 sequences are highly conserved within their transmembrane regions, part of their hydrophilic regions. We also found that there are two or more PIN1 copies in some of these angiosperm species. PIN1 sequences from Poaceae and Brassicaceae are representative of the modern clade. We identified 12 highly conserved motifs and a significant number of family-specific sites within these motifs. One family-specific site within Motif 11 shows a different residue between monocots and dicots, and is functionally critical for the polarity of PIN1. Likewise, the function of PIN1 appears to be different between monocots and dicots since the phenotype associated with PIN1 overexpression is opposite between Arabidopsis and rice. The evolution of angiosperm PIN1 protein-coding sequences appears to have been primarily driven by purifying selection, but traces of positive selection associated with sequences from certain families also seem to be present. We verified this observation by calculating the numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous changes on each branch of a phylogenetic tree. Our results indicate that the evolution of angiosperm PIN1 sequences involve strong purifying selection. In addition, our results suggest that the conserved sequences of PIN1 derive from a combination of the family-specific site variations and conserved motifs during their unique evolutionary processes, which is critical for the functional integrity and stability of these auxin transporters, especially in new species. Finally, functional difference of PIN1 is likely to be present in angiosperm because the positive selection is occurred in one branch of Poaceae.
24515831	Integrated analysis of the effects of cold and dehydration on rice metabolites, phytohormones, and gene transcripts.	2014	Plant Physiol	Correlations between gene expression and metabolite/phytohormone levels under abiotic stress conditions have been reported for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, little is known about these correlations in rice (Oryza sativa 'Nipponbare'), despite its importance as a model monocot. We performed an integrated analysis to clarify the relationships among cold- and dehydration-responsive metabolites, phytohormones, and gene transcription in rice. An integrated analysis of metabolites and gene expression indicated that several genes encoding enzymes involved in starch degradation, sucrose metabolism, and the glyoxylate cycle are up-regulated in rice plants exposed to cold or dehydration and that these changes are correlated with the accumulation of glucose (Glc), fructose, and sucrose. In particular, high expression levels of genes encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in the glyoxylate cycle correlate with increased Glc levels in rice, but not in Arabidopsis, under dehydration conditions, indicating that the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle may be involved in Glc accumulation under dehydration conditions in rice but not Arabidopsis. An integrated analysis of phytohormones and gene transcripts revealed an inverse relationship between abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and cytokinin (CK) signaling under cold and dehydration stresses; these stresses increase ABA signaling and decrease CK signaling. High levels of Oryza sativa 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase transcripts correlate with ABA accumulation, and low levels of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 735A transcripts correlate with decreased levels of a CK precursor in rice. This reduced expression of CYP735As occurs in rice but not Arabidopsis. Therefore, transcriptional regulation of CYP735As might be involved in regulating CK levels under cold and dehydration conditions in rice but not Arabidopsis.
24482761	The Xanthomonas Ax21 protein is processed by the general secretory system and is secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles.	2014	PeerJ	Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an important role in detecting invading pathogens and mounting a robust defense response to restrict infection. In rice, one of the best characterized PRRs is XA21, a leucine rich repeat receptor-like kinase that confers broad-spectrum resistance to multiple strains of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In 2009 we reported that an Xoo protein, called Ax21, is secreted by a type I-secretion system and that it serves to activate XA21-mediated immunity. This report has recently been retracted. Here we present data that corrects our previous model. We first show that Ax21 secretion does not depend on the predicted type I secretion system and that it is processed by the general secretion (Sec) system. We further show that Ax21 is an outer membrane protein, secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles. Finally, we provide data showing that ax21 knockout strains do not overcome XA21-mediated immunity.
24642810	Replacement of the endogenous starch debranching enzymes ISA1 and ISA2 of Arabidopsis with the rice orthologs reveals a degree of functional conservation during starch synthesis.	2014	PLoS One	This study tested the interchangeability of enzymes in starch metabolism between dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species. Amylopectin--a branched glucose polymer--is the major component of starch and is responsible for its semi-crystalline property. Plants synthesize starch with distinct amylopectin structures, varying between species and tissues. The structure determines starch properties, an important characteristic for cooking and nutrition, and for the industrial uses of starch. Amylopectin synthesis involves at least three enzyme classes: starch synthases, branching enzymes and debranching enzymes. For all three classes, several enzyme isoforms have been identified. However, it is not clear which enzyme(s) are responsible for the large diversity of amylopectin structures. Here, we tested whether the specificities of the debranching enzymes (ISA1 and ISA2) are major determinants of species-dependent differences in amylopectin structure by replacing the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis isoamylases (AtISA1 and AtISA2) with the monocotyledonous rice (Oryza sativa) isoforms. We demonstrate that the ISA1 and ISA2 are sufficiently well conserved between these species to form heteromultimeric chimeric Arabidopsis/rice isoamylase enzymes. Furthermore, we were able to reconstitute the endosperm-specific rice OsISA1 homomultimeric complex in Arabidopsis isa1isa2 mutants. This homomultimer was able to facilitate normal rates of starch synthesis. The resulting amylopectin structure had small but significant differences in comparison to wild-type Arabidopsis amylopectin. This suggests that ISA1 and ISA2 have a conserved function between plant species with a major role in facilitating the crystallization of pre-amylopectin synthesized by starch synthases and branching enzymes, but also influencing the final structure of amylopectin.
24504629	Small brown planthopper resistance loci in wild rice (Oryza officinalis).	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Host-plant resistance is the most practical and economical approach to control the rice planthoppers. However, up to date, few rice germplasm accessions that are resistant to the all three kinds of planthoppers (1) brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål), (2) the small brown planthopper (SBPH; Laodelphax striatellus Fallen), and (3) the whitebacked planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera Horvath) have been identified; consequently, the genetic basis for host-plant broad spectrum resistance to rice planthoppers in a single variety has been seldom studied. Here, one wild species, Oryza officinalis (Acc. HY018, 2n = 24, CC), was detected showing resistance to the all three kinds of planthoppers. Because resistance to WBPH and BPH in O. officinalis has previously been reported, the study mainly focused on its SBPH resistance. The SBPH resistance gene(s) was (were) introduced into cultivated rice via asymmetric somatic hybridization. Three QTLs for SBPH resistance detected by the SSST method were mapped and confirmed on chromosomes 3, 7, and 12, respectively. The allelic/non-allelic relationship and relative map positions of the three kinds of planthopper resistance genes in O. officinalis show that the SBPH, WBPH, and BPH resistance genes in O. officinalis were governed by multiple genes, but not by any major gene. The data on the genetics of host-plant broad spectrum resistance to planthoppers in a single accession suggested that the most ideally practical and economical approach for rice breeders is to screen the sources of broad spectrum resistance to planthoppers, but not to employ broad spectrum resistance gene for the management of planthoppers. Pyramiding these genes in a variety can be an effective way for the management of planthoppers.
24595621	Exogenous EDDS modifies copper-induced various toxic responses in rice.	2014	Protoplasma	Copper is a micronutrient required for living organisms, but is potentially toxic in excess. EDDS enhances the phytoextraction of many metals, but the underlying mechanism is fully unclear. Exposure of 200 μM Cu2+ for 3 days resulted in rice seedling growth inhibition, accompanied by a decrease in plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity, and an increase in relative electrolyte leakage ratios, indicating that maintaining of membrane structure integrity is crucial in acclimation of plants to heavy metal stress. In addition, the chlorophyll and carotenoid content was markedly decreased and the level of the mRNA of Cytochrome P450 gene, OsHMA9, the sulfate transporter gene, and the metallothionein-like protein gene was observed to increase in response to Cu stress. Cu treatment also induced a global epigenetic response which is associated with cell nucleus condensation. These physiological, genetic, and epigenetic responses of rice seedlings to excess copper were modified by the addition of EDDS, suggesting that the supply of EDDS in medium containing a high concentration of Cu ions could enhance plant tolerance potential to excess Cu toxicity through alleviating Cu-induced poisonous effects at various levels.
24575721	Metabolic adaptation to sugar/O2 deficiency for anaerobic germination and seedling growth in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Rice is characterized by a broad range of metabolic and morphological adaptations to flooding, such as germination and mobilization of stored nutrients under submergence until seedlings reach the water surface to carry out photosynthesis, and sustainable growth of mature plants for long durations under partial submergence. The underlying mechanisms of the molecular basis of adaptation to anaerobic germination and seedling growth in rice are being uncovered. Induction of an ensemble of hydrolases to mobilize endosperm nutrient reserves is one of the key factors for successful germination and coleoptile elongation in rice under submergence. To compensate for reduced efficiency of Tricarboxylic Acid cycle and oxidative respiration in mitochondria under O2 deficient conditions, α-amylases play a central role in the hydrolysis of starch to provide sugar substrates for glycolysis and alcohol fermentation for generating ATP. We review the progress on the molecular mechanism regulating α-amylase expression that involves the integration of signals generated by the hormone gibberellin (GA), sugar starvation and O2 deprivation that results in germination and sustainable seedling growth in rice under anaerobic conditions. Comparisons are also made between dicots and monocots for the molecular mechanism of induction of genes involved in alcohol fermentation and sugar/O2 deficiency sensing system.
24608025	Pasting and rheological properties of rice starch as affected by pullulan.	2014	Int J Biol Macromol	Effect of pullulan (PUL) on the pasting, rheological properties of rice starch (RS) was investigated. The swelling power, amylose leaching, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observation of the samples were also conducted to explore the possible interaction between starch and pullulan. Rapid visco-analysis (RVA) showed that PUL significantly changed viscosity parameters of rice starch-pullulan (RS-PUL) mixtures. Dynamic rheological measurements revealed that the modulus (G', G″) of the mixtures increased with the increase of pullulan concentration from 0.01% to 0.07%, but then decreased with the increase of pullulan concentration from 0.07% to 0.50%. The pasting and rheological properties of samples indicated that pullulan could blend well with rice starch and promote the gelatinization of starch granules at low concentration of pullulan, but suppress the gelatinization of starch granules at high concentration of pullulan. The results of swelling power, leached amylose and CLSM observation of samples further suggest that the interaction between starch and pullulan occurred in the RS-PUL system and the interaction was hypothesized to be responsible for these results.
24491293	Enhanced cellulase producing mutants developed from heterokaryotic Aspergillus strain.	2014	Bioresour Technol	A heterokaryon 28, derived through protoplast fusion between Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus tubingensis (Dal8), was subjected cyclic mutagenesis followed by selection on increasing levels of 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG) as selection marker. The derived deregulated cellulase hyper producing mutant '64', when compared to fusant 28, produced 9.83, 7.8, 3.2, 4.2 and 19.74 folds higher endoglucanase, β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, FPase and xylanase, respectively, under shake cultures. The sequence analysis of PCR amplified β-glucosidase gene from wild and mutant showed nucleotide deletion/substitution. The mutants showed highly catalytic efficient β-glucosidase as evident from low Km and high Vmax values. The expression profiling through zymogram analysis also indicated towards over-expression of cellulases. The up/down regulated expressed proteins observed through SDS-PAGE were identified by Peptide mass fingerprinting The cellulase produced by mutants in conjunction with cellulase free xylanase derived from Thermomyces lanuginosus was used for efficient utilization of alkali treated rice straw for obtaining xylo-oligosaccharides and ethanol.
24456533	FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 encodes a CBM48 domain-containing protein involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	2014	Plant J	Starch is the most widespread form of energy storage in the plant kingdom. Although many enzymes and related factors have been identified for starch biosynthesis, unknown players remain to be identified, given that it is a complicated and sophisticated process. The endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa) has been used for the study of starch synthesis. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM6 (FLO6) gene in rice. In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed. Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation. Map-based cloning showed that FLO6 encodes a protein of unknown function. It harbors an N-terminal transit peptide that ensures its correct localization and functions in the plastid, and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain that binds to starch. Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly. We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch-binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds. Our data provide a novel insight into the role of proteins with the CBM48 domain in plant species.
24463428	Expression and purification of a GRAS domain of SLR1, the rice DELLA protein.	2014	Protein Expr Purif	GRAS proteins belong to a plant specific protein family that participates in diverse and important functions in growth and development. GRAS proteins are typically composed of a variable N-terminal domain and highly conserved C-terminal GRAS domain. Despite the importance of the GRAS domain, little biochemical or structural analyses have been reported, mainly due to difficulties with purification of sufficient quality and quantity of protein. This study is focused on one of the most extensively studied GRAS proteins, the rice DELLA protein (SLR1), which is known to be involved in gibberellin (GA) signaling. Using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system we have achieved overproduction and purification of full-length SLR1. Limited proteolysis of the full-length SLR1 indicated that a region including the entire GRAS domain (SLR1(206-625)) is protease resistant. Based on those results, we have constructed an expression and purification system of the GRAS domain (SLR1(206-625)) in Escherichia coli. Several physicochemical assays have indicated that the folded structure of the GRAS domain is rich in secondary structural elements and that alanine substitutions for six cysteine residues improves protein folding without impairing function. Furthermore, by NMR spectroscopy we have observed direct interaction between the purified GRAS domain and the GA receptor GID1. Taken together, our purified preparation of the GRAS domain of SLR1 is suitable for further structural and functional studies that will contribute to precise understanding of the plant regulation mechanism through DELLA and GRAS proteins.
24291007	Trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase is required for development, virulence and mycotoxin biosynthesis apart from trehalose biosynthesis in Fusarium graminearum.	2014	Fungal Genet Biol	Trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS1) and trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (TPS2) are required for trehalose biosynthesis in yeast and filamentous fungi, including Fusarium graminearum. Three null mutants Δtps1, Δtps2 and Δtps1-Δtps2, each carrying either a single deletion of TPS1 or TPS2 or a double deletion of TPS1-TPS2, were generated from a toxigenic F. graminearum strain and were not able to synthesize trehalose. In contrast to its reported function in yeasts and filamentous fungi, TPS1 appeared dispensable for development and virulence. However, deletion of TPS2 abolished sporulation and sexual reproduction; it also altered cell polarity and ultrastructure of the cell wall in association with reduced chitin biosynthesis. The cell polarity alteration was exhibited as reduced apical growth and increased lateral growth and branching with increased hyphal and cell wall widths. Moreover, the TPS2-deficient strain displayed abnormal septum development and nucleus distribution in its conidia and vegetative hyphae. The Δtps2 mutant also had 62% lower mycelial growth on potato dextrose agar and 99% lower virulence on wheat compared with the wild-type. The Δtps1, Δtps2 and Δtps1-Δtps2 mutants synthesized over 3.08-, 7.09- and 2.47-fold less mycotoxins, respectively, on rice culture compared with the wild-type. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the Δtps1, Δtps2 and Δtps1-Δtps2 mutants had 486, 1885 and 146 genotype-specific genes, respectively, with significantly changed expression profiles compared with the wild-type. Further dissection of this pathway will provide new insights into regulation of fungal development, virulence and trichothecene biosynthesis.
24444413	Conserved genetic regions across angiosperms as tools to develop single-copy nuclear markers in gymnosperms: an example using cycads.	2014	Mol Ecol Resour	Several individuals of the Caribbean Zamia clade and other cycad genera were used to identify single-copy nuclear genes for phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies in Cycadales. Two strategies were employed to select target loci: (i) a tblastX search of Arabidopsis conserved ortholog sequence (COS) set and (ii) a tblastX search of Arabidopsis-Populus-Vitis-Oryza Shared Single-Copy genes (APVO SSC) against the EST Zamia databases in GenBank. From the first strategy, 30 loci were selected, and from the second, 16 loci. In both cases, the matching GenBank accessions of Zamia were used as a query for retrieving highly similar sequences from Cycas, Picea, Pinus species or Ginkgo biloba. After retrieving and aligning all the sequences in each locus, intron predictions were completed to assist in primer design. PCR was carried out in three rounds to detect paralogous loci. A total of 29 loci were successfully amplified as a single band of which 20 were likely single-copy loci. These loci showed different diversity and divergence levels. A preliminary screening allowed us to select 8 promising loci (40S, ATG2, BG, GroES, GTP, LiSH, PEX4 and TR) for the Zamia pumila complex and 4 loci (COS26, GroES, GTP and HTS) for all other cycad genera.
24472345	Established a new double antibodies sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1Ab toxin based single-chain variable fragments from a naïve mouse phage displayed library.	2014	Toxicon	ScFvs are composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains via a short linker that maintain the specific antigen binding abilities of antibodies. In this study, we constructed a naïve mouse phage displayed library to generate scFvs against Cry1Ab toxin. After affinity panning, positive phage-scFvs were isolated, sequenced and characterized by ELISA. The best binding ability scFv-G9 was expressed and purified. SDS-PAGE indicated that the relative molecular mass of scFv was estimated at 28 kDa. The purified scFv-G9 was used to develop a new DAS-ELISA for detecting Cry1Ab toxin, within minimum detection limit of 0.008 μg mL(-1), a working range 0.018-6.23 μg mL(-1), and the linear curve displayed an acceptable correlation coefficient of 0.98. The cross-reactivity showed that scFv-G9 had strongly binding ability to Cry1Ac toxin, but not to Cry1B, Cry1C and Cry1F toxin. The average recoveries of Cry1Ab toxin from spiked leaf and rice samples were in the range 92.1-94.8%, and 91.6-98.6%, respectively, with a coefficient of variation (C.V) less than 5.0%. These results showed promising applications of scfv-G9 for detecting Cry1Ab toxin with new DAS-ELISA.
24498057	RBS1, an RNA binding protein, interacts with SPIN1 and is involved in flowering time control in rice.	2014	PLoS One	The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance, and controls flowering time through interacting with the novel RNA/DNA binding KH domain protein SPIN1. Overexpression of Spin1 causes late flowering in transgenic rice under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. In this study, we characterized the function of the RNA-binding and SPIN1-interacting 1 (RBS1) protein in flowering time regulation. Rbs1 was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen using the full-length Spin1 cDNA as a bait and encodes an RNA binding protein with three RNA recognition motifs. The protein binds RNA in vitro and interacts with SPIN1 in the nucleus. Rbs1 overexpression causes delayed flowering under SD and LD conditions in rice. Expression analyses of flowering marker genes show that Rbs1 overexpression represses the expression of Hd3a under SD and LD conditions. Rbs1 is upregulated in both Spin1 overexpression plants and in the spl11 mutant. Interestingly, Spin1 expression is increased but Spl11 expression is repressed in the Rbs1 overexpression plants. Western blot analysis revealed that the SPIN1 protein level is increased in the Rbs1 overexpression plants and that the RBS1 protein level is also up-regulated in the Spin1 overexpression plants. These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice.
24650428	Proteomic analysis of interaction between P7-1 of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus and the insect vector reveals diverse insect proteins involved in successful transmission.	2014	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera) in a persistent-propagative manner, has caused serious yield losses in Asia. Here in a yeast two-hybrid system, protein interactions between SRBSDV P7-1 as a bait protein and a cDNA library of S. furcifera as prey protein were assessed. Of 153 proteins identified as putative interactors, 24 were selected for further analysis. Of the 24 proteins, 18 were further confirmed in a chemiluminescent coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay as true positive interactors with different strengths of interactions. Six potential candidate proteins (neuroglian, myosin light chain 2 [MLC2], polyubiquitin, E3 ubiquitin ligase, ribophorin ii, and profilin) were analyzed for gene expression in five organs by qRT-PCR; mRNA levels were highest in the gut for neuroglian, MLC2, polyubiquitin and profilin, in the salivary glands for ribophorin ii, and in the haemolymph for E3 ubiquitin ligase. A virus-host protein interaction network was constructed using SRBSDV P7-1 and 18 prey positive protein homologs of Drosophila melanogaster. Our findings suggest that these proteins are involved in the complex host reaction to infection by SRBSDV and provide new insights into the molecular basis of transmission.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by S. furcifera in a persistent-propagative manner, is a new found virus and a tentative member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae. It was widely noted by plant virologist, government officials and the farmers in Asia in recent years because of its epidemic outbreak and causing serious yield losses after 2009. However, the molecular mechanism by which SRBSDV successfully infects and replicates in both plant and insect hosts remains unclear, and much less is known about how the virus spreads from initially infected cells to adjacent cells in the insect vector. In the present study, we examined protein interactions between SRBSDV P7-1 as the bait and cDNA library of WBPH as the prey by using yeast two-hybrid system, 153 proteins were identified as putative interactors and 24 putative proteins were selected for chemiluminescent coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, and then constructed a viral protein-host protein interaction network with homologs of D. melanogaster. Six WBPH proteins were confirmed as potential P7-1 partners that take part in a pivotal role for viral movement in insect vector. These findings will greatly facilitate the understanding of the transmission mechanisms of SRBSDV by its insect vector. This is the first to study the molecular interaction between SRBSDV and its insect vector.
24734090	Simultaneous Measurement of Zinc, Copper, Lead and Cadmium in Baby Weaning Food and Powder Milk by DPASV.	2014	Iran J Pharm Res	Apart from the breast milk, infant formula and baby weaning food have a special role in infant diet. Infants and young children are very susceptible to amount of trace elements. Copper and zinc are two elements that add in infant food. Lead and cadmium are heavy metals that enter to food chain unavoidably. DPASV is a benefit and applicable method for measurement of trace elements in food products. In this study, concentration of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in four brands of baby food (rice and wheat based) and powder milk was analyzed with DPASV and polarograph set. Total Mean ± SE of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in baby foods (n = 240) were 11.86 ± 1.474 mg/100g, 508.197 ± 83.154 μg/100g, 0.445 ± 0.006, 0.050 ± 0.005 mg/Kg respectively. Also these amount in powder milk (n = 240) were 3.621± 0.529 mg/100g, 403.822 ± 133.953 μg/100g, 0.007 ± 0.003, 0.060 ± 0.040 mg/Kg respectively. Zinc level in baby food type I was higher than lablled value (P = 0.030), but in other brands was not difference. Concentration of copper in all of samples was in labeled range (P > 0.05). In each four products, level of lead and cadmium were lower than the standard limit (P < 0.05). Amount of zinc and lead in baby food I, had difference versus other products. Concentration of zinc, camium in baby food type I, was higher than type II (P = 0.043, 0.001 respectively). Concentration of lead and cadmium in baby food type II, was higher than infant formulas, but are in standard limit.
24489758	Allele distributions at hybrid incompatibility loci facilitate the potential for gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US.	2014	PLoS One	The accumulation of independent mutations over time in two populations often leads to reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation between diverging populations may be reinforced by barriers that occur either pre- or postzygotically. Hybrid sterility is the most common form of postzygotic isolation in plants. Four postzygotic sterility loci, comprising three hybrid sterility systems (Sa, s5, DPL), have been recently identified in Oryza sativa. These loci explain, in part, the limited hybridization that occurs between the domesticated cultivated rice varieties, O. sativa spp. japonica and O. sativa spp. indica. In the United States, cultivated fields of japonica rice are often invaded by conspecific weeds that have been shown to be of indica origin. Crop-weed hybrids have been identified in crop fields, but at low frequencies. Here we examined the possible role of these hybrid incompatibility loci in the interaction between cultivated and weedy rice. We identified a novel allele at Sa that seemingly prevents loss of fertility in hybrids. Additionally, we found wide-compatibility type alleles at strikingly high frequencies at the Sa and s5 loci in weed groups, and a general lack of incompatible alleles between crops and weeds at the DPL loci. Our results suggest that weedy individuals, particularly those of the SH and BRH groups, should be able to freely hybridize with the local japonica crop, and that prezygotic factors, such as differences in flowering time, have been more important in limiting weed-crop gene flow in the past. As the selective landscape for weedy rice changes due to increased use of herbicide resistant strains of cultivated rice, the genetic barriers that hinder indica-japonica hybridization cannot be counted on to limit the flow of favorable crop genes into weeds.
24504074	Alleviation of water stress effects on MR220 rice by application of periodical water stress and potassium fertilization.	2014	Molecules	The use of periodical water stress and potassium fertilization may enhance rice tolerance to drought stress and improve the crop's instantaneous water use efficiency without much yield reduction. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different periodical water stress combined with potassium fertilization regimes on growth, yield, leaf gas exchanges and biochemical changes in rice grown in pots and compare them with standard local rice grower practices. Five treatments including (1) standard local grower's practice (control, 80CF = 80 kg K2O/ha + control flooding); (2) 120PW15 = 120 kg K2O/ha + periodical water stress for 15 days; (3) 120DS15V = 120 kg K2O/ha + drought stress for 15 days during the vegetative stage; (4) 120DS25V = 120 kg K2O/ha + drought stress for 25 days and (5) 120DS15R = 120 kg K2O/ha + drought stress for 15 days during the reproductive stage, were evaluated in this experiment. Control and 120PW15 treatments were stopped at 100 DAS, and continuously saturated conditions were applied until harvest. It was found that rice under 120PW15 treatment showed tolerance to drought stress evidenced by increased water use efficiency, peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT) and proline levels, maximum efficiency of photosystem II (fv/fm) and lower minimal fluorescence (fo), compared to other treatments. Path coefficient analysis revealed that most of parameters contribute directly rather than indirectly to rice yield. In this experiment, there were four factors that are directly involved with rice yield: grain soluble sugar, photosynthesis, water use efficiency and total chlorophyll content. The residual factors affecting rice yield are observed to be quite low in the experiment (0.350), confirming that rice yield was mostly influenced by the parameters measured during the study.
24616563	Study on Folate Binding Domain of Dihydrofolate Reductase in Different Plant species and Human beings.	2014	Bioinformation	Data base (NCBI and TIGR) searches are made to retrieve protein sequences of different plant species namely Medicago truncatula, Pisum sativum, Ricinus communis, Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, Glycine max, Daucus carota, Oryza sativa Japonica Group, Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa Indica Group, Zea mays and careful alignment of derived sequences shows 95% or higher identity. Similarly, DHFR sequence of human being is also retrieved from NCBI. A phylogenetic tree is constructed from different plant and human DHFR domain using the Neighbour - Joining method in MEGA 5.05. Conservation score is performed by using PARALINE. Result suggests that folate binding domain of dihydrofolare reductase is conserved (score 8.06) and excepting some minor variations the basic structure of the domain in both plant species and human being is rather similar. Human DHFR domain contains PEKN sequence near active site, though proline is common for all the selected organisms but the other sequences are different in plants. The plant domain is always associated with TS (Thymidylate synthase). Plant based system is predicted to be an effective model for assessment of MTX (Methotrexate) and other antifolate drugs.
24466268	Genome-wide investigation and expression analyses of WD40 protein family in the model plant foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.).	2014	PLoS One	WD40 proteins play a crucial role in diverse protein-protein interactions by acting as scaffolding molecules and thus assisting in the proper activity of proteins. Hence, systematic characterization and expression profiling of these WD40 genes in foxtail millet would enable us to understand the networks of WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions. In the present study, a genome-wide survey was conducted and 225 potential WD40 genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis categorized the WD40 proteins into 5 distinct sub-families (I-V). Gene Ontology annotation revealed the biological roles of the WD40 proteins along with its cellular components and molecular functions. In silico comparative mapping with sorghum, maize and rice demonstrated the orthologous relationships and chromosomal rearrangements including duplication, inversion and deletion of WD40 genes. Estimation of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates revealed its evolutionary significance in terms of gene-duplication and divergence. Expression profiling against abiotic stresses provided novel insights into specific and/or overlapping expression patterns of SiWD40 genes. Homology modeling enabled three-dimensional structure prediction was performed to understand the molecular functions of WD40 proteins. Although, recent findings had shown the importance of WD40 domains in acting as hubs for cellular networks during many biological processes, it has invited a lesser research attention unlike other common domains. Being a most promiscuous interactors, WD40 domains are versatile in mediating critical cellular functions and hence this genome-wide study especially in the model crop foxtail millet would serve as a blue-print for functional characterization of WD40s in millets and bioenergy grass species. In addition, the present analyses would also assist the research community in choosing the candidate WD40s for comprehensive studies towards crop improvement of millets and biofuel grasses.
24392772	Comparison of creatine supplementation before versus after supervised resistance training in healthy older adults.	2014	Res Sports Med	This study was performed to compare the effects of creatine supplementation (CR) before vs. after supervised resistance training (RT) in healthy older adults. Participants were randomized to one of two groups: CR-Before (0.1g•kg(-1) creatine before + 0.1g•kg(-1) placebo [rice flour] after RT, n = 11) or CR-After (placebo before + creatine after RT, n = 11). Resistance training (RT) was performed 3 days/week, on nonconsecutive days, for 12 weeks. Prior to and following the study, measures were taken for body composition, maximum strength, muscle protein catabolism, and kidney function. Over the 12-week training period, both groups experienced a significant increase in whole-body lean tissue mass, limb muscle thickness, and upper and lower body strength and a decrease in muscle protein catabolism (p < 0.001), with no differences between groups. There was no change in kidney function over time. Changes in muscle mass or strength are similar when creatine is ingested before or after supervised resistance training in older adults.
24372757	p-Coumaroyl-CoA:monolignol transferase (PMT) acts specifically in the lignin biosynthetic pathway in Brachypodium distachyon.	2014	Plant J	Grass lignins contain substantial amounts of p-coumarate (pCA) that acylate the side-chains of the phenylpropanoid polymer backbone. An acyltransferase, named p-coumaroyl-CoA:monolignol transferase (OsPMT), that could acylate monolignols with pCA in vitro was recently identified from rice. In planta, such monolignol-pCA conjugates become incorporated into lignin via oxidative radical coupling, thereby generating the observed pCA appendages; however p-coumarates also acylate arabinoxylans in grasses. To test the authenticity of PMT as a lignin biosynthetic pathway enzyme, we examined Brachypodium distachyon plants with altered BdPMT gene function. Using newly developed cell wall analytical methods, we determined that the transferase was involved specifically in monolignol acylation. A sodium azide-generated Bdpmt-1 missense mutant had no (<0.5%) residual pCA on lignin, and BdPMT RNAi plants had levels as low as 10% of wild-type, whereas the amounts of pCA acylating arabinosyl units on arabinoxylans in these PMT mutant plants remained unchanged. pCA acylation of lignin from BdPMT-overexpressing plants was found to be more than three-fold higher than that of wild-type, but again the level on arabinosyl units remained unchanged. Taken together, these data are consistent with a defined role for grass PMT genes in encoding BAHD (BEAT, AHCT, HCBT, and DAT) acyltransferases that specifically acylate monolignols with pCA and produce monolignol p-coumarate conjugates that are used for lignification in planta.
24578651	Rapid preparation of biosorbents with high ion exchange capacity from rice straw and bagasse for removal of heavy metals.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	This work describes the preparation of the cellulose phosphate with high ion exchange capacity from rice straw and bagasse for removal of heavy metals. In this study, rice straw and bagasse were modified by the reaction with phosphoric acid in the presence of urea. The introduced phosphoric group is an ion exchangeable site for heavy metal ions. The reaction by microwave heating yielded modified rice straw and modified bagasse with greater ion exchange capacities (∼3.62 meq/g) and shorter reaction time (1.5-5.0 min) than the phosphorylation by oil bath heating. Adsorption experiments towards Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Cr³⁺ ions of the modified rice straw and the modified bagasse were performed at room temperature (heavy metal concentration 40 ppm, adsorbent 2.0 g/L). The kinetics of adsorption agreed with the pseudo-second-order model. It was shown that the modified rice straw and the modified bagasse could adsorb heavy metal ions faster than the commercial ion exchange resin (Dowax). As a result of Pb²⁺ sorption test, the modified rice straw (RH-NaOH 450W) removed Pb²⁺ much faster in the initial step and reached 92% removal after 20 min, while Dowax (commercial ion exchange resin) took 90 min for the same removal efficiency.
24492537	Defining reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR analysis of anther development in rice.	2014	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is one of the most accurate and widely used methods for gene expression analysis. However, the choice of reference genes for normalization is critical for accurate quantification of gene expression. As development of genomics, mining large-scale datasets such as microarray and RNA-sequencing data becomes a new approach for exploitation of new reference genes. In this study, we analyzed an RNA-sequencing dataset of rice anther and 167 microarray datasets involving different tissues and developing stages of rice anthers and pollens. We selected 12 candidate genes and other 5 reference genes, including ACT1, eEF-1α, GAPDH, Exp2, and CCDC72 used in previous studies, and evaluated their expression in eight tissues and different developmental stages of anthers in rice variety 9311 and Yuetai. UPF3, eIF4A-3, GAPDH, and PPP6 were identified as the most suitable reference genes for qPCR analysis of anther development in rice. The new candidate reference genes showed more stable expression than the traditionally used reference genes. These results provide a set of reliable reference genes for studies in rice anther developmental process.
24646527	Cytological and transcriptional dynamics analysis of host plant revealed stage-specific biological processes related to compatible rice-Ustilaginoidea virens interaction.	2014	PLoS One	Rice false smut, a fungal disease caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is becoming a severe detriment to rice production worldwide. However, little is known about the molecular response of rice to attacks by the smut pathogen. In this article, we define the initial infection process as having three stages: initial colonization on the pistil (stage 1, S1), amplification on the anther (stage 2, S2) and sporulation in the anther chambers (stage 3, S3). Based on the transcriptome of rice hosts in response to U. virens in two separate years, we identified 126, 204, and 580 specific regulated genes in their respective stages S1, S2, and S3, respectively, by excluding common expression patterns in other openly biotic/abiotic databases using bioinformatics. As the disease progresses, several stage-specific biological processes (BP) terms were distinctively enriched: "Phosphorylation" in stage S1, "PCD" in S2, and "Cell wall biogenesis" in S3, implying a concise signal cascade indicative of the tactics that smut pathogens use to control host rice cells during infection. 113 regulated genes were coexpressed among the three stages. They shared highly conserved promoter cis-element in the promoters in response to the regulation of WRKY and Myb for up-regulation, and ABA and Ca2+ for down regulation, indicating their potentially critical roles in signal transduction during rice-U. virens interaction. We further analyzed seven highly regulated unique genes; four were specific to pollen development, implying that pollen-related genes play critical roles in the establishment of rice susceptibility to U. virens. To my knowledge, this is the first report about probing of molecular response of rice to smut pathogen infection, which will greatly expand our understanding of the molecular events surrounding infection by rice false smut.
24635058	Rice LTG1 is involved in adaptive growth and fitness under low ambient temperature.	2014	Plant J	Low temperature (LT) is one of the most prevalent factors limiting the productivity and geographical distribution of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the effect of LT on seed germination and reproductive development in rice, the genetic component affecting vegetative growth under LT remains poorly understood. Here, we report that rice cultivars harboring the dominant LTG1 (Low Temperature Growth 1) allele are more tolerant to LT (15-25°C, a temperature range prevalent in high-altitude, temperate zones and high-latitude areas), than those with the ltg1 allele. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we show that LTG1 encodes a casein kinase I. A functional nucleotide polymorphism was identified in the coding region of LTG1, causing a single amino acid substitution (I357K) that is associated with the growth rate, heading date and yield of rice plants grown at LT. We present evidence that LTG1 affects rice growth at LT via an auxin-dependent process(es). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of this locus suggests that the ltg1 haplotype arose before the domestication of rice in tropical climates. Together, our data demonstrate that LTG1 plays an important role in the adaptive growth and fitness of rice cultivars under conditions of low ambient temperature.
24493253	Biosafety management and commercial use of genetically modified crops in China.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	As a developing country with relatively limited arable land, China is making great efforts for development and use of genetically modified (GM) crops to boost agricultural productivity. Many GM crop varieties have been developed in China in recent years; in particular, China is playing a leading role in development of insect-resistant GM rice lines. To ensure the safe use of GM crops, biosafety risk assessments are required as an important part of the regulatory oversight of such products. With over 20 years of nationwide promotion of agricultural biotechnology, a relatively well-developed regulatory system for risk assessment and management of GM plants has been developed that establishes a firm basis for safe use of GM crops. So far, a total of seven GM crops involving ten events have been approved for commercial planting, and 5 GM crops with a total of 37 events have been approved for import as processing material in China. However, currently only insect-resistant Bt cotton and disease-resistant papaya have been commercially planted on a large scale. The planting of Bt cotton and disease-resistant papaya have provided efficient protection against cotton bollworms and Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), respectively. As a consequence, chemical application to these crops has been significantly reduced, enhancing farm income while reducing human and non-target organism exposure to toxic chemicals. This article provides useful information for the colleagues, in particular for them whose mother tongue is not Chinese, to clearly understand the biosafety regulation and commercial use of genetically modified crops in China.
24663342	Ubiquitin ligase EL5 maintains the viability of root meristems by influencing cytokinin-mediated nitrogen effects in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	Root formation is dependent on meristematic activity and is influenced by nitrogen supply. We have previously shown that ubiquitin ligase, EL5, in rice (Oryza sativa) is involved in the maintenance of root meristematic viability. When mutant EL5 protein is overexpressed to dominantly inhibit the endogenous EL5 function in rice, primordial and meristematic necrosis ia observed. Here, we analysed the cause of root cell death in transgenic rice plants (mEL5) overexpressing EL5V162A, which encodes a partly inactive ubiquitin ligase. The mEL5 mutants showed increased sensitivity to nitrogen that was reflected in the inhibition of root formation. Treatment of mEL5 with nitrate or nitrite caused meristematic cell death accompanied by browning. Transcriptome profiling of whole roots exhibited overlaps between nitrite-responsive genes in non-transgenic (NT) rice plants and genes with altered basal expression levels in mEL5. Phytohormone profiling of whole roots revealed that nitrite treatment increased cytokinin levels, but mEL5 constitutively contained more cytokinin than NT plants and showed increased sensitivity to exogenous cytokinin. More superoxide was detected in mEL5 roots after treatment with nitrite or cytokinin, and treatment with an inhibitor of superoxide production prevented mEL5 roots from both nitrite- and cytokinin-induced meristematic cell death. These results indicate a nitrogen-triggered pathway that leads to changes in root formation through the production of cytokinin and superoxide, on which EL5 acts to prevent meristematic cell death.
24460219	Quantitative proteomics reveals the role of protein phosphorylation in rice embryos during early stages of germination.	2014	J Proteome Res	Seed germination begins with water uptake and ends with radicle emergence. A gel-free phosphoproteomic technique was used to investigate the role of protein phosphorylation events in the early stages of rice seed germination. Both seed weight and ATP content increased gradually during the first 24 h following imbibition. Proteomic analysis indicated that carbohydrate metabolism- and protein synthesis/degradation-related proteins were predominantly increased and displayed temporal patterns of expression. Analyses of cluster and protein-protein interactions indicated that the regulation of sucrose synthases and alpha-amylases was the central event controlling germination. Phosphoproteomic analysis identified several proteins involved in protein modification and transcriptional regulation that exhibited significantly temporal changes in phosphorylation levels during germination. Cluster analysis indicated that 12 protein modification-related proteins had a peak abundance of phosphoproteins at 12 h after imbibition. These results suggest that the first 12 h following imbibition is a potentially important signal transduction phase for the initiation of rice seed germination. Three core components involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction displayed significant increases in phosphoprotein abundance during the early stages of germination. Brassinolide treatment increased the rice seed germination rate but not the rate of embryonic axis elongation. These findings suggest that brassinosteroid signal transduction likely triggers seed germination.
24420860	Suppression of expression of the putative receptor-like kinase gene NRRB enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an important disease of rice, which is responsible for the economic losses worldwide. Functional investigation of differentially expressed protein genes (DEPGs) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) upon Xoc infection provides insight into the molecular mechanism of rice-Xoc interactions. Here, we show that one of DEPGs designated NRRB plays a role in rice-Xoc interactions. NRRB, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene was preferentially expressed in leaf blades and leaf sheaths where the pathogen colonized. Its transcription was depressed by two defense-signal compounds salicylic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid, but was activated by wounding and abscisic acid. Additionally, a plenty of cis-elements associated with stress responses were discovered in the promoter region of NRRB. These data suggest that NRRB is involved in stress responses. More importantly, the NRRB-suppressing rice plants exhibited enhanced resistance against BLS, with the markedly shorter average lesion length than that of the wild type. Furthermore, transcription of some salicylic acid synthesis-related and pathogenesis-related genes including PAD4, PR1a and WRKY13 in transgenic plants was activated, implying that enhanced resistance to BLS might be mediated by the activation of the SA signaling pathway. In conclusion, NRRB gene is involved in various stress responses and regulating resistance to BLS, therefore it might be one of useful genes for rice improvement in future.
24603050	Deciphering the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in controlling SamDC gene expression in rice.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Lately we have published on the characterization of the upstream of SamDC gene from rice and investigated the involvement of various cis-elements present in the promoter region in its transcriptional regulation. Analysis of SamDC expression showed that it was inducible by abiotic stresses like salinity, drought, and cold as well as by light and ABA treatment. Furthermore, DNA protein interaction studies have identified transacting actors responsible for its expression after abiotic stresses or light inducibility. Here we have further discussed on the possible role of these cis-elements in modulating the transcriptional network and comment on their function in relation to polyamine biosynthesis during periods of abiotic stress in rice.
24641700	Heterologous expression of a gene of Magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus 1 strain A disrupts growth of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.	2014	Microbiol Immunol	Magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus 1 strain A (MoCV1-A) is the causal agent of growth repression and attenuated virulence (hypovirulence) of the rice blast fungus, M. oryzae. We have previously reported that heterologous expression of MoCV1-A ORF4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in growth defects, a large central vacuole and other cytological changes. In this study, the effects of open reading frame (ORF) 4 expression in Cryptococcus neoformans, a human pathogenic fungus responsible for severe opportunistic infection, were investigated. Cells expressing the ORF4 gene in C. neoformans showed remarkably enlarged vacuoles, nuclear diffusion and a reduced growth rate. In addition, expression of ORF4 apparently suppressed formation of the capsule that surrounds the entire cell wall, which is one of the most important components of expression of virulence. After 5-fluoroorotic acid treatment of ORF4-expressing cells to remove the plasmid carrying the ORF4 gene, the resultant plasmid-free cells recovered normal morphology and growth, indicating that heterologous expression of the MoCV1-A ORF4 gene induces negative effects in C. neoformans. These data suggest that the ORF4 product is a candidate for a pharmaceutical protein to control disease caused by C. neoformans.
24442786	Proteome analysis for antifungal effects of Bacillus subtilis KB-1122 on Magnaporthe grisea P131.	2014	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe grisea threatens rice production worldwide. It is important to develop novel and environment-safe strategies to control the fungus. Here we reported that Bacillus subtilis KB-1122 could strikingly inhibit the growth of M. grisea P131 in agar diffusion assays. To further understand the molecular mechanism on the suppressive role of B. subtilis on M. grisea, the antagonist-pathogen interaction of the two strains was studied by using comparative proteome analysis in this report. The cellular and culture supernatant (CSN) proteins were prepared from co-culture and subjected to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteome analysis revealed 33 cellular and 18 CSN proteins showing changes upon co-culture respectively. Importantly, down-regulated cellular proteins came from M. grisea, whereas up-regulated proteins derived from B. subtilis. Results suggested that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serine protein kinase might contribute to antifungal activity of B. subtilis KB-1122. Of CSN proteins identified, the endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (involved in degradation of polysaccharides) was up-regulated consistently at different times of incubation. This suggests that this enzyme plays an important role in the interaction between B. subtilis KB-1122 with M. grisea P131.
24681716	Excavation of Pid3 orthologs with differential resistance spectra to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice resource.	2014	PLoS One	Twenty-six orthologs of the rice blast resistance gene Pid3 from cultivated varieties and wild rice accessions distributed in different areas were cloned by allele mining. Sequence analysis showed that while each of the orthologous genes from indica varieties and most wild accessions encodes a complete NBS-LRR protein, each of the proteins encoded by those from japonica varieties and few wild rice accessions presents a premature termination. Eleven of the 26 orthologs were selected for blast resistance testing by transforming into the blast susceptible rice variety TP309, respectively. Inoculation of 23 M. oryzae strains collected from diverse regions of China to the respective transgenic plants revealed that 6 Pid3 orthologs showed susceptible to all the tested strains, while the other 5 orthologs showed differential resistance spectra in a gradually spectrum-widen order as Pid3-W3, Pid3-W4, Pid3-I3, Pid3-W5 and Pid3-I1. Amino acid sequences alignment of these orthologs indicated that the sequence diversities between the blast resistance orthologs were mostly located in the LRR domain such as the substitutions of Q694H,D856H,Q896R,D899E etc. However, the differences between the resistance orthologs and the susceptible ones were mostly located in the NBS domain. The present experiments provide an example of that the ortholog evaluation of plant R genes could be an efficient way to expand the rice blast resistance and some other plant disease resistance as well for breeding.
24556665	A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	Reproductive barriers perform a vital role during speciation. Hybrid weakness, the poorer development of hybrids compared with their parents, hinders gene exchange between different species at the postzygotic stage. Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperature-dependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice. Hwi1 comprises two leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) genes, 25L1 and 25L2, which are specific to wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and induce hybrid weakness. Hwi2, a rare allele that is predominantly distributed in indica rice (Oryza sativa), encodes a secreted putative subtilisin-like protease. Functional analysis indicated that pyramiding of Hwi1 and Hwi2 activates the autoimmune response in the basal nodes of hybrids, interrupting root formation and then impairing shoot growth. These findings bring new insights into our understanding of reproductive isolation and may benefit rice breeding.
24666983	Molecular biology of K+ transport across the plant cell membrane: what do we learn from comparison between plant species?	2014	J Plant Physiol	Cloning and characterizations of plant K(+) transport systems aside from Arabidopsis have been increasing over the past decade, favored by the availability of more and more plant genome sequences. Information now available enables the comparison of some of these systems between species. In this review, we focus on three families of plant K(+) transport systems that are active at the plasma membrane: the Shaker K(+) channel family, comprised of voltage-gated channels that dominate the plasma membrane conductance to K(+) in most environmental conditions, and two families of transporters, the HAK/KUP/KT K(+) transporter family, which includes some high-affinity transporters, and the HKT K(+) and/or Na(+) transporter family, in which K(+)-permeable members seem to be present in monocots only. The three families are briefly described, giving insights into the structure of their members and on functional properties and their roles in Arabidopsis or rice. The structure of the three families is then compared between plant species through phylogenic analyses. Within clusters of ortologues/paralogues, similarities and differences in terms of expression pattern, functional properties and, when known, regulatory interacting partners, are highlighted. The question of the physiological significance of highlighted differences is also addressed.
24648012	A Halloween gene shadow is a potential target for RNA-interference-based pest management in the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus.	2015	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Laodelphax striatellus is an economically important rice pest in China. Ecdysteroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone regulates insect development and reproduction. The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase Shadow (Sad) plays a critical role in ecdysteroidogenesis. Here, tests were conducted to establish whether Lssad was a potential target gene for RNA-interference-based management of L. striatellus.

RESULTS: Lssad was cloned and characterised. LsSad had Helix-C, Helix-I, Helix-K, PERF and haem-binding motifs. Lssad is expressed at a higher level in the thorax, where prothoracic glands are located, compared with the level in the head or abdomen. It showed two expression peaks in day 2 and day 4-5 fourth-instar nymphs, and two troughs in day 1 fourth and fifth instars. Oral delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of Lssad at the nymph stage successfully knocked down the expression of the target gene, reduced the expression level of ecdysone receptor (LsEcR) gene, caused nymphal lethality and delayed development in a dose-dependent manner. Ingestion of 20-hydroxyecdysone in Lssad-dsRNA-exposed nymphs did not increase Lssad expression level, but almost completely rescued the LsEcR mRNA level and relieved the negative effects on survival and development.

CONCLUSIONS: The ecdysteroidogenic pathway is conserved in L. striatellus. Lssad can serve as a possible target for dsRNA-based pesticides for planthopper control.
24450747	Biosynthesis, elicitation and roles of monocot terpenoid phytoalexins.	2014	Plant J	A long-standing goal in plant research is to optimize the protective function of biochemical agents that impede pest and pathogen attack. Nearly 40 years ago, pathogen-inducible diterpenoid production was described in rice, and these compounds were shown to function as antimicrobial phytoalexins. Using rice and maize as examples, we discuss recent advances in the discovery, biosynthesis, elicitation and functional characterization of monocot terpenoid phytoalexins. The recent expansion of known terpenoid phytoalexins now includes not only the labdane-related diterpenoid superfamily but also casbane-type diterpenoids and β-macrocarpene-derived sequiterpenoids. Biochemical approaches have been used to pair pathway precursors and end products with cognate biosynthetic genes. The number of predicted terpenoid phytoalexins is expanding through advances in cereal genome annotation and terpene synthase characterization that likewise enable discoveries outside the Poaceae. At the cellular level, conclusive evidence now exists for multiple plant receptors of fungal-derived chitin elicitors, phosphorylation of membrane-associated signaling complexes, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, involvement of phytohormone signals, and the existence of transcription factors that mediate the expression of phytoalexin biosynthetic genes and subsequent accumulation of pathway end products. Elicited production of terpenoid phytoalexins exhibit additional biological functions, including root exudate-mediated allelopathy and insect antifeedant activity. Such findings have encouraged consideration of additional interactions that blur traditionally discrete phytoalexin classifications. The establishment of mutant collections and increasing ease of genetic transformation assists critical examination of further biological roles. Future research directions include examination of terpenoid phytoalexin precursors and end products as potential signals mediating plant physiological processes.
24535191	Proteomic analysis of copper-binding proteins in excess copper-stressed rice roots by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and two-dimensional electrophoresis.	2014	Biometals	Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient required for plant growth and development. However, excess Cu can inactivate and disturb protein structure as a result of unavoidable binding to proteins. To understand better the mechanisms involved in Cu toxicity and tolerance in plants, we developed a new immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) method for the separation and isolation of Cu-binding proteins extracted from roots of rice seedling exposed to excess Cu. In our method, IDA-Sepharose or EDDS-Sepharose column (referred as pre-chromatography) and Cu-IDA-Sepharose column (referred as Cu-IMAC) were connected in tandem. Namely, protein samples were pre-chromatographed with IDA-Sepharose column to removal metal ions, then protein solution was flowed into Cu-IMAC column for enriching Cu-binding proteins in vitro. Compared with the control (Cu-IMAC without any pre-chromatography), IDA-Sepharose pre-chromatography method markedly increased yield of the Cu-IMAC-binding proteins, and number of protein spots and the abundance of 40 protein spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels. Thirteen protein spots randomly selected from 2-DE gel and 11 proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. These putative Cu-binding proteins included those involved in antioxidant defense, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, protein folding and stabilization, protein transport and cell wall synthesis. Ten proteins contained one or more of nine putative metal-binding motifs reported by Smith et al. (J Proteome Res 3:834-840, 2004) and seven proteins contained one or two of top six motifs reported by Kung et al. (Proteomics 6:2746-2758, 2006). Results demonstrated that more proteins specifically bound with Cu-IMAC could be enriched through removal of metal ions from samples by IDA-Sepharose pre-chromatography. Further studies are needed on metal-binding characteristics of these proteins in vivo and the relationship between Cu ions and protein biological activities to fully understand the mechanisms of Cu tolerance and toxicity in plants.
24395199	Plant growth enhancement and associated physiological responses are coregulated by ethylene and gibberellin in response to harpin protein Hpa1.	2014	Planta	The harpin protein Hpa1 produced by the bacterial blight pathogen of rice induces several growth-promoting responses in plants, activating the ethylene signaling pathway, increasing photosynthesis rates and EXPANSIN (EXP) gene expression levels, and thereby enhancing the vegetative growth. This study was attempted to analyze any mechanistic connections among the above and the role of gibberellin in these responses. Hpa1-induced growth enhancement was evaluated in Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. And growth-promoting responses were determined mainly as an increase of chlorophyll a/b ratio, which indicates a potential elevation of photosynthesis rates, and enhancements of photosynthesis and EXP expression in the three plant species. In Arabidopsis, Hpa1-induced growth-promoting responses were partially compromised by a defect in ethylene perception or gibberellin biosynthesis. In tomato and rice, compromises of Hpa1-induced growth-promoting responses were caused by a pharmacological treatment with an ethylene perception inhibitor or a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. In the three plant species, moreover, Hpa1-induced growth-promoting responses were significantly impaired, but not totally eliminated, by abolishing ethylene perception or gibberellin synthesis. However, simultaneous nullifications in both ethylene perception and gibberellin biosynthesis almost canceled the full effects of Hpa1 on plant growth, photosynthesis, and EXP2 expression. Theses results suggest that ethylene and gibberellin coregulate Hpa1-induced plant growth enhancement and associated physiological and molecular responses.
24624317	Bioconversion of xylose, hexoses and biomass to ethanol by a new isolate of the white rot basidiomycete Trametes versicolor.	2014	Springerplus	Second-generation bioethanol production requires the development of economically feasible and sustainable processes that use renewable lignocellulosic biomass as a starting material. However, the microbial fermentation of xylose, which is the principal pentose sugar in hemicellulose, is a limiting factor in developing such processes. Here, a strain of the white rot basidiomycete Trametes versicolor that was capable of efficiently fermenting xylose was newly isolated and characterized. This strain, designated KT9427, was capable of assimilating and converting xylose to ethanol under anaerobic conditions with a yield of 0.44 g ethanol per 1 g of sugar consumed. In culture medium containing low yeast extract concentrations, xylose consumption and ethanol productivity were enhanced. Adjusting the initial pH between 3.0 and 5.0 did not markedly influence xylose fermentation. T. versicolor KT9427 also produced ethanol from glucose, mannose, fructose, cellobiose and maltose at yields ranging from 0.45 to 0.49 g ethanol per 1 g of sugar consumed. In addition, strain KT9427 exhibited favourable conversion of non-pretreated starch, cellulose, xylan, wheat bran and rice straw into ethanol compared to common recombinant yeast strains. Taken together, the present findings suggest that T. versicolor KT9427 is a promising candidate for environmentally friendly ethanol production directly from lignocellulosic biomass.
24548060	Group VII ethylene response factor diversification and regulation in four species from flood-prone environments.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Flooding events negatively affect plant performance and survival. Flooding gradients thereby determine the dynamics in vegetation composition and species abundance. In adaptation to flooding, the group VII Ethylene Response Factor genes (ERF-VIIs) play pivotal roles in rice and Arabidopsis through regulation of anaerobic gene expression and antithetical survival strategies. We investigated if ERF-VIIs have a similar role in mediating survival strategies in eudicot species from flood-prone environments. Here, we studied the evolutionary origin and regulation of ERF-VII transcript abundance and the physiological responses in species from two genera of divergent taxonomic lineages (Rumex and Rorippa). Synteny analysis revealed that angiosperm ERF-VIIs arose from two ancestral loci and that subsequent diversification and duplication led to the present ERF-VII variation. We propose that subtle variation in the regulation of ERF-VII transcript abundance could explain variation in tolerance among Rorippa species. In Rumex, the main difference in flood tolerance correlated with the genetic variation in ERF-VII genes. Large transcriptional differences were found by comparing the two genera: darkness and dark submergence-induced Rumex ERF-VIIs, whereas HRE2 expression was increased in submerged Rorippa roots. We conclude that the involvement of ERF-VIIs in flooding tolerance developed in a phylogenetic-dependent manner, with subtle variations within taxonomic clades.
24649705	Mechanism and kinetics study on the ozonolysis reaction of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the atmosphere.	2014	J Environ Sci (China)	The ozonolysis of 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) is an efficient degradation way in the atmosphere. The ozonolysis process and possible reactions path of Criegee Intermediates with NO and H2O are introduced in detail at the method of MPWB1K/6-31+G(d,p)//MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df,2p) level. In ozonolysis, H2O is an important source of OH radical formation and initiated the subsequent degradation reaction. The Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory was applied to calculate rate constants with the temperature ranging from 200 to 600 K. The rate constant of reaction between 2,3,7,8-TCDD and O3 is 4.80 x 10(-20) cm3/(mole x sec) at 298 K and 760 Torr. The atmospheric lifetime of the reaction species was estimated according to rate constants, which is helpful for the atmospheric model study on the degradation and risk assessment of dioxin.
24532719	SOAPdenovo-Trans: de novo transcriptome assembly with short RNA-Seq reads.	2014	Bioinformatics	MOTIVATION: Transcriptome sequencing has long been the favored method for quickly and inexpensively obtaining a large number of gene sequences from an organism with no reference genome. Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, RNA-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 × 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makes de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge.

RESULTS: Here, we present SOAPdenovo-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for RNA-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how SOAPdenovo-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that SOAPdenovo-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and user manual are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovotrans/.
24520314	Gene discovery and molecular marker development, based on high-throughput transcript sequencing of Paspalum dilatatum Poir.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Paspalum dilatatum Poir. (common name dallisgrass) is a native grass species of South America, with special relevance to dairy and red meat production. P. dilatatum exhibits higher forage quality than other C4 forage grasses and is tolerant to frost and water stress. This species is predominantly cultivated in an apomictic monoculture, with an inherent high risk that biotic and abiotic stresses could potentially devastate productivity. Therefore, advanced breeding strategies that characterise and use available genetic diversity, or assess germplasm collections effectively are required to deliver advanced cultivars for production systems. However, there are limited genomic resources available for this forage grass species.

RESULTS: Transcriptome sequencing using second-generation sequencing platforms has been employed using pooled RNA from different tissues (stems, roots, leaves and inflorescences) at the final reproductive stage of P. dilatatum cultivar Primo. A total of 324,695 sequence reads were obtained, corresponding to c. 102 Mbp. The sequences were assembled, generating 20,169 contigs of a combined length of 9,336,138 nucleotides. The contigs were BLAST analysed against the fully sequenced grass species of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Brachypodium distachyon, the closely related Sorghum bicolor and foxtail millet (Setaria italica) genomes as well as against the UniRef 90 protein database allowing a comprehensive gene ontology analysis to be performed. The contigs generated from the transcript sequencing were also analysed for the presence of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A total of 2,339 SSR motifs were identified within 1,989 contigs and corresponding primer pairs were designed. Empirical validation of a cohort of 96 SSRs was performed, with 34% being polymorphic between sexual and apomictic biotypes.

CONCLUSIONS: The development of genetic and genomic resources for P. dilatatum will contribute to gene discovery and expression studies. Association of gene function with agronomic traits will significantly enable molecular breeding and advance germplasm enhancement.
24454828	MoPex19, which is essential for maintenance of peroxisomal structure and woronin bodies, is required for metabolism and development in the rice blast fungus.	2014	PLoS One	Peroxisomes are present ubiquitously and make important contributions to cellular metabolism in eukaryotes. They play crucial roles in pathogenicity of plant fungal pathogens. The peroxisomal matrix proteins and peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are synthesized in the cytosol and imported post-translationally. Although the peroxisomal import machineries are generally conserved, some species-specific features were found in different types of organisms. In phytopathogenic fungi, the pathways of the matrix proteins have been elucidated, while the import machinery of PMPs remains obscure. Here, we report that MoPEX19, an ortholog of ScPEX19, was required for PMPs import and peroxisomal maintenance, and played crucial roles in metabolism and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. MoPEX19 was expressed in a low level and Mopex19p was distributed in the cytoplasm and newly formed peroxisomes. MoPEX19 deletion led to mislocalization of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs), as well peroxisomal matrix proteins. Peroxisomal structures were totally absent in Δmopex19 mutants and woronin bodies also vanished. Δmopex19 exhibited metabolic deficiency typical in peroxisomal disorders and also abnormality in glyoxylate cycle which was undetected in the known mopex mutants. The Δmopex19 mutants performed multiple disorders in fungal development and pathogenicity-related morphogenesis, and lost completely the pathogenicity on its hosts. These data demonstrate that MoPEX19 plays crucial roles in maintenance of peroxisomal and peroxisome-derived structures and makes more contributions to fungal development and pathogenicity than the known MoPEX genes in the rice blast fungus.

24688383	Phytase production by Aspergillus niger CFR 335 and Aspergillus ficuum SGA 01 through submerged and solid-state fermentation.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	Fermentation is one of the industrially important processes for the development of microbial metabolites that has immense applications in various fields. This has prompted to employ fermentation as a major technique in the production of phytase from microbial source. In this study, a comparison was made between submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentations (SSF) for the production of phytase from Aspergillus niger CFR 335 and Aspergillus ficuum SGA 01. It was found that both the fungi were capable of producing maximum phytase on 5th day of incubation in both submerged and solid-state fermentation media. Aspergillus niger CFR 335 and A. ficuum produced a maximum of 60.6 U/gds and 38 U/gds of the enzyme, respectively, in wheat bran solid substrate medium. Enhancement in the enzyme level (76 and 50.7 U/gds) was found when grown in a combined solid substrate medium comprising wheat bran, rice bran, and groundnut cake in the ratio of 2 : 1 : 1. A maximum of 9.6 and 8.2 U/mL of enzyme activity was observed in SmF by A. niger CFR 335 and A.ficuum, respectively, when grown in potato dextrose broth.
24656338	Generation and characterization of a tomato DCL3-silencing mutant.	2014	Plant Sci	DICER-like 3 (DCL3) is a major player in heterochromatic 24-nucleotide (nt) small RNA (sRNA) and long microRNA (lmiRNA) biogenesis, and higher plant DCL3 mutants have been characterized from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Here, a tomato DCL3 (SlDCL3) mutant was generated through the use of trans-activated artificial miRNA and characterized. Constitutive trans-activation knocked down SlDCL3 levels by ∼64%, resulting in dramatically decreased 24-nt sRNA levels and a significant increase in 21- and 22-nt sRNAs. The latter was correlated with specific upregulation of SlDCL4 and SlDCL2b, which function in the biogenesis of 21- and 22-nt sRNAs, respectively. Moreover, at the majority of sRNA-generating genomic loci, an almost complete overlap between small RNA signatures of control and silenced seedlings was observed, suggesting that the reductions in 24-nt sRNAs at these loci were compensated for by biogenesis of 21- and 22-nt sRNAs from the same double-stranded RNA substrates. In addition, bioinformatic analysis and reduced expression in SlDCL3-silenced seedlings identified four novel tomato lmiRNAs, two of which were found to be developmentally regulated. Taken together, these results establish the requirement of SlDCL3 for the biogenesis of 24-nt sRNAs and lmiRNAs in tomato and suggest SlDCL4 and SlDCL2b as surrogates for SlDCL3.
24502996	Geochemical associations and availability of cadmium (Cd) in a paddy field system, northwestern Thailand.	2014	Environ Pollut	The Mae Tao watershed, northwest Thailand, has become contaminated with cadmium (Cd) as a result of zinc ore extraction (Padaeng deposit) in the nearby Thanon-Thongchai mountains. Consumption of contaminated rice has led to documented human health impacts. The aim of this study was to elucidate transfer pathways from creek and canal waters to the paddy field soils near Baan Mae Tao Mai village and to determine the relationship between Cd speciation in the soil and uptake by rice plants. Transfer mainly occurred in association with particulate matter during flooding and channel dredging and, in contrast with many other studies, most of the soil Cd was associated with exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between soil total Cd and rice grain Cd (R(2) = 0.715), but a stronger relationship between both the Tessier-exchangeable soil Cd and the BCR-exchangeable soil Cd and rice grain Cd (R(2) = 0.898 and 0.862, respectively).
24570169	Genomic analysis of NAC transcription factors in banana (Musa acuminata) and definition of NAC orthologous groups for monocots and dicots.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance to abiotic stresses is important in crop breeding. A comprehensive understanding of the gene families associated with drought tolerance is therefore highly relevant. NAC transcription factors form a large plant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of tissue development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The main goal of this study was to set up a framework of orthologous groups determined by an expert sequence comparison of NAC genes from both monocots and dicots. In order to clarify the orthologous relationships among NAC genes of different species, we performed an in-depth comparative study of four divergent taxa, in dicots and monocots, whose genomes have already been completely sequenced: Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, Musa acuminata and Oryza sativa. Due to independent evolution, NAC copy number is highly variable in these plant genomes. Based on an expert NAC sequence comparison, we propose forty orthologous groups of NAC sequences that were probably derived from an ancestor gene present in the most recent common ancestor of dicots and monocots. These orthologous groups provide a curated resource for large-scale protein sequence annotation of NAC transcription factors. The established orthology relationships also provide a useful reference for NAC function studies in newly sequenced genomes such as M. acuminata and other plant species.
24548184	Effect of cultural conditions on antrodin C production by basidiomycete Antrodia camphorata in solid-state fermentation.	None	Biotechnol Appl Biochem	Antrodia camphorata is a medicinal fungus and antrodin C is one of the main bioactive components of A. camphorata in the submerged fermentation (SmF). To optimize the culture conditions, the factors influencing the production of antrodin C by A. camphorata under solid-state fermentation (SSF) were investigated in this study. Different solid substrates and external nitrogen sources were tested for their efficiency in producing antrodin C. The response surface methodology was applied to evaluate the influence of several variables, namely, the concentrations of soybean meal, initial moisture content, and inoculum density on antrodin C production in solid-state fermentation. The experimental results show that the optimum fermentation medium for antrodin C production by A. camphorata was composed of 0.578 g soybean meal, 0.05 g Na2 HPO4 , 0.05 g MgSO4 for 100 g rice, with 51.83% initial moisture content, 22 day culture time, 28 °C culture temperature, and 35.54% inoculum density. At optimized conditions, 6,617.36 ± 92.71 mg kg(-1) yield of antrodin C was achieved. Solid-state fermentation is one good cultural method to improve the production of antrodin C by A. camphorata.
24676962	Development of a novel transgenic rice with hypocholesterolemic activity via high-level accumulation of the α' subunit of soybean β-conglycinin.	2014	Transgenic Res	Soybean 7S globulin, known as β-conglycinin, has been shown to regulate human plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Furthermore, the α' subunit of β-conglycinin has specifically been shown to possess low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol-lowering activity. Therefore, accumulation of the α' subunit of β-conglycinin in rice seeds could lead to the production of new functional rice that could promote human health. Herein, we used the low-glutelin rice mutant 'Koshihikari' (var. a123) and suppressed its glutelins and prolamins, the major seed storage proteins of rice, by RNA interference. The accumulation levels of the α' subunit in the lines with suppressed glutelin and prolamin levels were >20 mg in 1 g of rice seeds, which is considerably higher than those in previous studies. Oral administration of the transgenic rice containing the α' subunit exhibited a hypocholesterolemic activity in rats; the serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced when compared to those of the control rice (var. a123). The cholesterol-lowering action by transgenic rice accumulating the α' subunit induces a significant increase in fecal bile acid excretion and a tendency to increase in fecal cholesterol excretion. This is the first report that transgenic rice exhibits a hypocholesterolemic activity in rats in vivo by using the β-conglycinin α' subunit.
24613105	Functional analysis of histone deacetylase and its role in stress response, drug resistance and solid-state cultivation in Aspergillus oryzae.	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	In the eukaryotic cell, histone deacetylases (HDACs) play key roles in the regulation of fundamental cellular process such as development regulation, stress response, secondary metabolism and genome integrity. Here, we provide a comprehensive phenotypic analysis using HDAC disruptants in Aspergillus oryzae. Our study revealed that four HDACs, hdaA/Aohda1, hdaB/Aorpd3, hdaD/Aohos2 and hst4/AohstD were involved in stress response, cell wall synthesis and chromatin integrity in A. oryzae. Osmotic stress sensitivity of HDAC disruptants differed between plate cultures and liquid cultures, suggesting that HDACs adapt to the difference environmental conditions. Using a common A. oryzae fermentation medium, rice-koji, we also characterized HDACs related to growth and enzyme production to investigate which HDACs will be required for adaptation to environmental conditions and stress resistances. Because HDACs are widely conserved, our study has broad applications and may inform work with filamentous fungi and other eukaryote.
24661044	Addition of lenalidomide to rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (RICER) in first-relapse/primary refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	2014	Br J Haematol	Relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with a poor prognosis. Outcomes are particularly poor following immunochemotherapy failure or relapse within 12 months of induction. We conducted a Phase I/II trial of lenalidomide plus RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) (RICER) as a salvage regimen for first-relapse or primary refractory DLBCL. Dose-escalated lenalidomide was combined with RICE every 14 d. After three cycles of RICER, patients with chemosensitive disease underwent stem cell collection and consolidation with BEAM [BCNU (carmustine), etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan] followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT). Patients who recovered from autoSCT toxicities within 90 d initiated maintenance treatment with lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 21 d every 28 d for 12 months. No dose-limiting or unexpected toxicities occurred with lenalidomide 25 mg plus RICE. Grade 3/4 haematological toxicities resolved appropriately, and planned dose density and dose intensity of RICER were preserved. No lenalidomide or RICE dose reductions were required in any of the three cycles. After two cycles of RICER, nine of 15 patients (60%) achieved a complete response, and two achieved a partial response (13%). Combining lenalidomide with RICE is feasible, and results in promising response rates (particularly complete response rates) in high-risk DLBCL patients.
24548197	Rice protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome with transient specific IgE to boiled rice but not to retort-processed rice.	2014	Pediatr Int	Described herein is the case of an 8-month-old girl with atypical food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome due to rice. She presented with vomiting and poor general activity 2 h after ingestion of boiled rice. Oral food challenge test using high-pressure retort-processed rice was negative, but re-exposure to boiled rice elicited gastrointestinal symptoms. On western blot analysis the patient's serum was found to contain IgE bound to crude protein extracts from rice seed or boiled rice, but not from retort-processed rice. The major protein bands were not detected in the electrophoresed gel of retort-processed rice extracts, suggesting decomposition by high-temperature and high-pressure processing. Oral food challenge for diagnosing rice allergy should be performed with boiled rice to avoid a false negative. Additionally, some patients with rice allergy might be able to ingest retort-processed rice as a substitute for boiled rice.
24502317	Aptamer binding to celiac disease-triggering hydrophobic proteins: a sensitive gluten detection approach.	2014	Anal Chem	Celiac disease represents a significant public health problem in large parts of the world. A major hurdle in the effective management of the disease by celiac sufferers is the sensitivity of the current available methods for assessing gluten contents in food. In response, we report a highly sensitive approach for gluten analysis using aptamers as specific receptors. Gliadins, a fraction of gluten proteins, are the main constituent responsible for triggering the disease. However, they are highly hydrophobic and large molecules, regarded as difficult targets for in vitro evolution of aptamers without nucleobase modification. We describe the successful selection of aptamers for these water insoluble prolamins that was achieved choosing the immunodominant apolar peptide from α2-gliadin as a target for selection. All aptamers evolved are able to bind the target in its native environment within the natural protein. The best nonprotein receptor is the basis for an electrochemical competitive enzyme-linked assay on magnetic particles, which allows the measurement of as low as 0.5 ppb of gliadin standard (0.5 ppm of gluten). Reference immunoassay for detecting the same target has a limit of detection of 3 ppm, 6 times less sensitive than this method. Importantly, it also displays high specificity, detecting the other three prolamins toxic for celiac patients and not showing cross-reactivity to nontoxic proteins such as maize, soya, and rice. These features make the proposed method a valuable tool for gluten detection in foods.
24632440	Comparative functional analysis of the velvet gene family reveals unique roles in fungal development and pathogenicity in Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	Fungal Genet Biol	The ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is an economically important pathogen that causes rice blast disease worldwide. Accumulating evidence indicates that the fungal velvet genes are key regulators of a number of cellular processes, including development, pathogenicity and secondary metabolism, in many species of fungi. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized four genes (MoVOSA, MoVELB, MoVEA, and MoVELC) from the genome of the fungal pathogen M. oryzae. These genes were homologous to the velvet gene family of Aspergillus nidulans. Deletions of MoVEA, MoVELB, and MoVELC resulted in a significant decrease in conidiation, indicating their roles as positive regulators thereof. The MoVELC gene was involved in development of conidial morphology, while MoVELB and MoVEA appeared necessary for conidial germination, MoVEA further being indispensable for appressorial development and modulation of reactive oxygen species in disease development. Deletion of MoVELC affected the cell wall integrity of appressoria, resulting in failure to penetrate host cells. Unexpectedly, MoVOSA appeared dispensable for the development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae, even though its homologs play specific roles in other fungal species. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the velvet genes are linked to M. oryzae infection-related development and pathogenicity, and the findings provide a framework for comparative studies of the conserved velvet gene family across a range of fungal taxa, which may provide new insight into fungal development and pathogenicity.
24515640	RNA interference of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase of the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, increases susceptibility to insecticides.	2015	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is essential for numerous biological reactions catalysed by microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). Knockdown of CPR in several insects leads to developmental defects and increased susceptibility to insecticides. However, information about the role of CPR in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is still unavailable.

RESULTS: A full-length cDNA encoding CPR was cloned from N. lugens (NlCPR). The deduced amino acid sequence showed marked features of classical CPRs, such as an N-terminus membrane anchor, conserved domains for flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate binding, as well as an FAD-binding motif and catalytic residues. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NlCPR was located in a branch along with bed bug and pea aphid hemipteran insects. NlCPR mRNA was detectable in all tissues and developmental stages of N. lugens, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. NlCPR transcripts were most abundant in the abdomen in adults, and in first-instar nymphs. Injection of N. lugens with double-strand RNA (dsRNA) against NlCPR significantly reduced the transcription level of the mRNA, and silencing of NlCPR resulted in increased susceptibility in N. lugens to beta-cypermethrin and imidacloprid.

CONCLUSION: The results provide first evidence that NlCPR contributes to the susceptibility to beta-cypermethrin and imidacloprid in N. lugens.
24407603	Overexpression of the Malus hupehensis MhNPR1 gene increased tolerance to salt and osmotic stress in transgenic tobacco.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Earlier, we have reported that overexpression of Malus hupehensis Non-expressor of pathogenesis related gene 1 (MhNPR1) gene in tobacco could induce the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhance resistance to fungus Botrytis cinerea. In this study, we showed that MhNPR1 can be induced by NaCl, PEG6000, low temperature (4 °C), abscisic acid and apple aphids' treatments in M. hupehensis. Heterogonous expression of MhNPR1 gene in tobacco conferred enhanced resistance to NaCl at the stage of seed germination, and conferred resistance to mannitol at the stage of seed germination and to PEG6000 at the stage of seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of MhNPR1 in transgenic tobacco led to higher expression levels of osmotic-stress related genes compared with wild-type plants. This was the first report of a novel function of NPR1 that overexpression of MhNPR1 gene has a positive effect on salt and osmotic stress in tobacco, which differs from the function that overexpressing of AtNPR1 gene has a negative effect on dehydration and salt stress in rice.
24613924	A starch-binding domain identified in α-amylase (AmyP) represents a new family of carbohydrate-binding modules that contribute to enzymatic hydrolysis of soluble starch.	2014	FEBS Lett	A novel starch-binding domain (SBD) that represents a new carbohydrate-binding module family (CBM69) was identified in the α-amylase (AmyP) of the recently established alpha-amylase subfamily GH13_37. The SBD and its homologues come mostly from marine bacteria, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that they are closely related to the CBM20 and CBM48 families. The SBD exhibited a binding preference toward raw rice starch, but the truncated mutant (AmyPΔSBD) still retained similar substrate preference. Kinetic analyses revealed that the SBD plays an important role in soluble starch hydrolysis because different catalytic efficiencies have been observed in AmyP and the AmyPΔSBD.
24423401	Genetic diversity of transcriptional activator-like effector genes in Chinese isolates of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2014	Phytopathology	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola causes bacterial leaf streak (BLS), a devastating disease of rice in Asia countries. X. oryzae pv. oryzicola utilizes repertoires of transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALEs) to manipulate host resistance or susceptibility; thus, TALEs can determine the outcome of BLS. In this report, we studied genetic diversity in putative tale genes of 65 X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains that originated from nine provinces of southern China. Genomic DNAs from the 65 strains were digested with BamHI and hybridized with an internal fragment of avrXa3, a tale gene originating from the related pathogen, X. oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes bacterial leaf blight (BLB). Southern blot analysis indicated that the strains contained a variable number (9 to 22) of avrXa3-hybridizing fragments (e.g., putative tale genes). Based on the number and size of hybridizing bands, strains were classified into 14 genotypes (designated 1 to 14), and genotypes 3 and 10 represented 29.23 and 24.64% of the total, respectively. A high molecular weight BamHI fragment (HMWB; ≈6.0 kb) was present in 12 of the 14 genotypes, and sequence analysis of the HMWB revealed the presence of a C-terminally truncated tale, an insertion element related to IS1403, and genes encoding phosphoglycerate mutase and endonuclease V. Primers were developed from the 6.0-kb HMWB fragment and showed potential in genotyping X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains by polymerase chain reaction. Virulence of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains was assessed on 23 rice cultivars containing different resistance genes for BLB. The X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains could be grouped into 14 pathotypes (I to XIV), and the grouping of strains was almost identical to the categories determined by genotypic analysis. In general, strains containing higher numbers of putative tale genes were more virulent on rice than strains containing fewer tales. The results also indicate that there are no gene-for-gene relationships between the tested rice lines and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains. To our knowledge, this is the first description of genetic diversity of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains based on tale gene analysis.
24667993	The Arabidopsis kinesin gene AtKin-1 plays a role in the nuclear division process during megagametogenesis.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Atkin - 1 , the only Kinesin-1 member of Arabidopsis thaliana , plays a role during female gametogenesis through regulation of nuclear division cycles. Kinesins are microtubule-dependent motor proteins found in eukaryotic organisms. They constitute a superfamily that can be further classified into at least 14 families. In the Kinesin-1 family, members from animal and fungi play roles in long-distance transport of organelles and vesicles. Although Kinesin-1-like sequences have been identified in higher plants, little is known about their function in plant cells, other than in a recently identified Kinesin-1-like protein in a rice pollen semi-sterile mutant. In this study, the gene encoding the only Kinesin-1 member in Arabidopsis, AtKin-1 was found to be specifically expressed in ovules and anthers. AtKin-1 loss-of-function mutants showed substantially aborted ovules in siliques, and this finding was supported by complementation testing. Reciprocal crossing between mutant and wild-type plants indicated that a defect in AtKin-1 results in partially aborted megagametophytes, with no observable effects on pollen fertility. Further observation of ovule development in the mutant pistils indicated that the enlargement of the megaspore was blocked and nuclear division arrested at the one-nucleate stage during embryo sac formation. Our data suggest that AtKin-1 plays a role in the nuclear division cycles during megagametogenesis.
24423072	Efficient yeast cell-surface display of exo- and endo-cellulase using the SED1 anchoring region and its original promoter.	2014	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: The recombinant yeast strains displaying the heterologous cellulolytic enzymes on the cell surface using the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring system are considered promising biocatalysts for direct conversion of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol. However, the cellulolytic activities of the conventional cellulase-displaying yeast strains are insufficient for the hydrolysis of cellulose. In this study, we constructed novel gene cassettes for the efficient cellulose utilization by cellulase-displaying yeast strains.

RESULTS: The novel gene cassettes for the cell-surface display of Aspergillus aculeatus β-glucosidase (BGL1) and Trichoderma reeseii endoglucanase II (EGII) were constructed using the promoter and the GPI anchoring region derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae SED1. The gene cassettes were integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome, then the β-glucosidase activity of these recombinant strains was evaluated. We revealed that simultaneous utilization of the SED1 promoter and Sed1 anchoring domain in a gene cassette enabled highly-efficient enzyme integration into the cell wall. The β-glucosidase activity of recombinant yeast cells transduced with the novel gene cassette was 8.4-fold higher than that of a conventional strain. The novel EGII-displaying strain also achieved 106-fold higher hydrolysis activity against the water-insoluble cellulose than a conventional strain. Furthermore, direct ethanol production from hydrothermally processed rice straw was improved by the display of T. reeseii EGII using the novel gene cassette.

CONCLUSIONS: We have developed novel gene cassettes for the efficient cell-surface display of exo- and endo-type cellulolytic enzymes. The results suggest that this gene cassette has the wide applicability for cell-surface display and that cellulase-displaying yeasts have significant potential for cost-effective bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.
24548461	A rice-based soluble form of a murine TNF-specific llama variable domain of heavy-chain antibody suppresses collagen-induced arthritis in mice.	2014	J Biotechnol	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Although anti-TNF antibody therapy is now commonly used to treat patients suffering from these inflammatory conditions, the cost of treatment continues to be a concern. Here, we developed a rice transgenic system for the production of a llama variable domain of a heavy-chain antibody fragment (VHH) specific for mouse TNF in rice seeds (MucoRice-mTNF-VHH). MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was produced at high levels in the rice seeds when we used our most recent transgene-overexpression system with RNA interference technology that suppresses the production of major rice endogenous storage proteins while enhancing the expression of the transgene-derived protein. Production levels of mTNF-VHH in rice seeds reached an average of 1.45% (w/w). Further, approximately 91% of mTNF-VHH was released easily when the powder form of MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was mixed with PBS. mTNF-VHH purified by means of single-step gel filtration from rice PBS extract showed high neutralizing activity in an in vitro mTNF cytotoxicity assay using WEHI164 cells. In addition, purified mTNF-VHH suppressed progression of collagen-induced arthritis in mice. These results show that this rice-expression system is useful for the production of neutralizing VHH antibody specific for mTNF.
24720198	[Impact of rice agriculture on nitrogen and phosphorus exports in streams in hilly red soil earth region of central subtropics].	2014	Huan Jing Ke Xue	The research selected the Tuojia catchment and Jianshan catchment in Changsha County, Hunan Province, to comparatively study the effects of rice agriculture on the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and exports in streams in the typical agricultural catchments of the hilly red soil earth region. The monitoring of 16 months suggested that, there was a moderate stream nutrient pollution in both Tuojia and Jianshan catchments, especially for nitrogen pollution. Comparing the two catchments, the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were higher and the water quality was worse in the Tuojia catchment than that in the Jianshan catchment. From the nutrient composition of view, ammonia nitrogen was the main species of total nitrogen in the Tuojia catchment (accounting for 58.5% of total nitrogen), while it was nitrate nitrogen in the Jianshan catchment (accounting for 76. 1% of total nitrogen). The proportion of dissolved phosphorus in total phosphorus was 47. 1% in the Tuojia catchment, higher than the proportion of 37.5% in the Jianshan catchment. From temporal variations of nutrient dynamics of view, concentrations of all forms of nitrogen were higher during January to February and in July, respectively, and total phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus were higher during May to June and during October to December. Since the stream discharge in the catchments concentrated during the rice growing period from April to October, the higher nutrient concentrations during the period suggested potential risks of nitrogen and phosphorus losses. The total nitrogen mass flux was 1.67 kg x (hm2 x month)(-1) and TP was 0.06 kg x (hm2 x month)(-1) in the Tuojia catchment, which were greater than the 0.44 kg x (hm2 x month)(-1) and 0.02 kg x (hm2 x month)(-1) in the Jianshan catchment. Given the similar climate, geomorphology, soil type and cultivation patterns but the different area proportion of rice agriculture between two catchments, results suggested that, under the traditional crop management in hilly red soil earth region of central subtropics, the higher area proportion of rice agriculture has the potential to degrade stream aquatic environment.
24520158	Evolution of gene structural complexity: an alternative-splicing-based model accounts for intron-containing retrogenes.	2014	Plant Physiol	The structure of eukaryotic genes evolves extensively by intron loss or gain. Previous studies have revealed two models for gene structure evolution through the loss of introns: RNA-based gene conversion, dubbed the Fink model and retroposition model. However, retrogenes that experienced both intron loss and intron-retaining events have been ignored; evolutionary processes responsible for the variation in complex exon-intron structure were unknown. We detected hundreds of retroduplication-derived genes in human (Homo sapiens), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and categorized them either as duplicated genes that have all introns lost or as duplicated genes that have at least lost one and retained one intron compared with the parental copy (intron-retaining [IR] type). Our new model attributes intron retention alternative splicing to the generation of these IR-type gene pairs. We presented 25 parental genes that have an intron retention isoform and have retained introns in the same locations in the IR-type duplicate genes, which directly support our hypothesis. Our alternative-splicing-based model in conjunction with the retroposition and Fink models can explain the IR-type gene observed. We discovered a greater percentage of IR-type genes in plants than in animals, which may be due to the abundance of intron retention cases in plants. Given the prevalence of intron retention in plants, this new model gives a support that plant genomes have very complex gene structures.
24651725	Improved algorithms for the classification of rough rice using a bionic electronic nose based on PCA and the Wilks distribution.	2014	Sensors (Basel)	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the main methods used for electronic nose pattern recognition. However, poor classification performance is common in classification and recognition when using regular PCA. This paper aims to improve the classification performance of regular PCA based on the existing Wilks Λ-statistic (i.e., combined PCA with the Wilks distribution). The improved algorithms, which combine regular PCA with the Wilks Λ-statistic, were developed after analysing the functionality and defects of PCA. Verification tests were conducted using a PEN3 electronic nose. The collected samples consisted of the volatiles of six varieties of rough rice (Zhongxiang1, Xiangwan13, Yaopingxiang, WufengyouT025, Pin 36, and Youyou122), grown in same area and season. The first two principal components used as analysis vectors cannot perform the rough rice varieties classification task based on a regular PCA. Using the improved algorithms, which combine the regular PCA with the Wilks Λ-statistic, many different principal components were selected as analysis vectors. The set of data points of the Mahalanobis distance between each of the varieties of rough rice was selected to estimate the performance of the classification. The result illustrates that the rough rice varieties classification task is achieved well using the improved algorithm. A Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) was also established to test the effectiveness of the improved algorithms. The first two principal components (namely PC1 and PC2) and the first and fifth principal component (namely PC1 and PC5) were selected as the inputs of PNN for the classification of the six rough rice varieties. The results indicate that the classification accuracy based on the improved algorithm was improved by 6.67% compared to the results of the regular method. These results prove the effectiveness of using the Wilks Λ-statistic to improve the classification accuracy of the regular PCA approach. The results also indicate that the electronic nose provides a non-destructive and rapid classification method for rough rice.
24548063	The degenerate EAL-GGDEF domain protein Filp functions as a cyclic di-GMP receptor and specifically interacts with the PilZ-domain protein PXO_02715 to regulate virulence in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Degenerate GGDEF and EAL domain proteins represent major types of cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) receptors in pathogenic bacteria. Here, we characterized a FimX-like protein (Filp) which possesses both GGDEF and EAL domains in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice. Both in silico analysis and enzyme assays indicated that the GGDEF and EAL domains of Filp were degenerate and enzymatically inactive. However, Filp bound to c-di-GMP efficiently within the EAL domain, where Q(477), E(653), and F(654) residues were crucial for the binding. Deletion of the filp gene in X. oryzae pv. oryzae resulted in attenuated virulence in rice and reduced type III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression. Complementation analysis with different truncated proteins indicated that REC, PAS, and EAL domains but not the GGDEF domain were required for the full activity of Filp in vivo. In addition, a PilZ-domain protein (PXO_02715) was identified as a Filp interactor by yeast two-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays. Deletion of the PXO_02715 gene demonstrated changes in bacterial virulence and T3SS gene expression similar to Δfilp. Moreover, both mutants were impaired in their ability to induce hypersensitive response in nonhost plants. Thus, we concluded that Filp was a novel c-di-GMP receptor of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and its function to regulate bacterial virulence expression might be via the interaction with PXO_02715.
24470637	Emerging functions of nodulin-like proteins in non-nodulating plant species.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant genes whose expression is induced in legumes by Rhizobium bacteria upon nodulation were initially referred to as nodulins. Several of them play a key role in the establishment of symbiosis. Yet, nodulin-like proteins are also found in non-nodulating plant species such as Arabidopsis, rice, maize or poplar. For instance, 132 are predicted in the Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 genome. Recent studies now highlight the importance of nodulin-like proteins for the transport of nutrients, solutes, amino acids or hormones and for major aspects of plant development. Interestingly, nodulin-like activities at the plant-microbe interface are also important for pathogens to enhance their fitness during host colonization. This work presents a genomic and functional overview of nodulin-like proteins in non-leguminous plant species, with a particular focus on Arabidopsis and rice.
24638148	Development of a rice-based peptide vaccine for Japanese cedar and cypress pollen allergies.	2014	Transgenic Res	Peptide immunotherapy using dominant T-cell epitopes is a safe treatment alternative to conventional subcutaneous injection of natural crude allergen extract, which is sometimes accompanied by anaphylactic shock. For Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP), hybrid peptides composed of six to seven major T-cell epitopes (7Crp peptide) from the causative allergens Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 have been developed on the basis of different human leukemia antigen class II restrictions, because of the diversity of patients' genetic backgrounds. However, other dominant T-cell epitopes that are produced in some patients are not covered by these peptides. To develop a more universal peptide vaccine for JCP, we generated transgenic rice seeds containing seven new T-cell epitopes (Crp3) in addition to the T-cell epitopes used in the 7Crp peptide. Next, we co-expressed unique T-cell epitopes (6Chao) from the Japanese cypress pollen allergens Cha o 1 and Cha o 2 in transgenic rice seeds, with 7Crp and Crp3. These transgenic rice seeds, containing many highly homologous T-cell epitopes derived from cedar and cypress allergens, are expected to be applicable to a wide range of patients suffering from these pollen allergies.
24682189	Antioxidant potential of green leafy porridges.	2014	Ceylon Med J	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the antioxidant potential of porridges (kola kenda) made incorporating herbs.

DESIGN: Experimental study. Main outcome measures Total phenolic content was estimated by Folin Ciocalteau method (GAEmg/g(FW) and the antioxidant potential by ABTS free radical scavenging activity (TEAC(μg)/100g (FW).

RESULTS: Total phenolics and antioxidant potentials of porridges ranged from 5-73 TEAC(μg) /100g and 0.9- 34.2 GAEg/100g respectively. Significantly high (p ≤ 0.05) total phenolic contents were observed in C. auriculata ("Ranawara") [342 GAE mg/g (FW)] and in M. koenigii ("Karapincha") [199 GAEmg/g(FW)]. The highest antioxidant effect was in C. auriculata ("Ranawara") [73 TEAC(μg)/100g(FW)] followed by M. koenigi ("Karapincha") [26 TEAC(μg)/100g (FW)] and C. ternatea ("Ela Katarolu") [24 TEAC(μg)/100g (FW)]. Lowest antioxidant effect was in porridges made with rice and coconut milk both of which had comparable values. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient > 0.8) between total phenolics and the antioxidant potential was observed for all porridges except for Asparagus racemosus (Haathawariya) porridge which had a high antioxidant potential with a low phenolic content.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that green leafy porridges are a good source of antioxidants in addition to their reported low glycaemic indices.
24669667	Response of aerobic rice to Piriformospora indica.	2014	Indian J Exp Biol	Rice cultivation under aerobic condition not only saves water but also opens up a splendid scope for effective application of beneficial root symbionts in rice crop unlike conventional puddled rice cultivation where water logged condition acts as constraint for easy proliferation of various beneficial soil microorganisms like arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Keeping these in view, an in silico investigation were carried out to explore the interaction of hydrogen phosphate with phosphate transporter protein (PTP) from P. indica. This was followed by greenhouse investigation to study the response of aerobic rice to Glomusfasciculatum, a conventional P biofertilizer and P. indica, an alternative to AM fungi. Computational studies using ClustalW tool revealed several conserved motifs between the phosphate transporters from Piriformospora indica and 8 other Glomus species. The 3D model of PTP from P. indica resembling "Mayan temple" was successfully docked onto hydrogen phosphate, indicating the affinity of this protein for inorganic phosphorus. Greenhouse studies revealed inoculation of aerobic rice either with P. indica, G. fasciculatum or both significantly enhanced the plant growth, biomass and yield with higher NPK, chlorophyll and sugar compared to uninoculated ones, P. indica inoculated plants being superior. A significantly enhanced activity of acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were noticed in the rhizosphere soil of rice plants inoculated either with P. indica, G. fasciculatum or both, contributing to higher P uptake. Further, inoculation of aerobic rice plants with P. indica proved to be a better choice as a potential biofertilizer over mycorrhiza.
24291601	Comparative proteomics reveals association of early accumulated proteins in conferring butachlor tolerance in three N(2)-fixing Anabaena spp.	2014	J Proteomics	UNLABELLED: Butachlor an extensively used rice field herbicide negatively affects the cyanobacterial proliferation, yet the molecular mechanism underlying its toxicity in diazotrophic cyanobacteria is largely unknown. The present study focuses on the comparative proteomics to decode the molecular basis of butachlor toxicity/tolerance in three Anabaena species e.g. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Anabaena doliolum and Anabaena L31. 75 differentially expressed proteins from each Anabaena sp. included those involved in photosynthesis, C, N and protein metabolism, redox homeostasis, and signal transduction. While early accumulated proteins related to photosynthesis (atpA, atpB), carbon metabolism (glpx, fba and prk), protein folding (groEL, PPIase), regulation (orrA) and other function (OR, akr) appeared crucial for tolerance of Anabaena L31, the late accumulated proteins in Anabaena 7120 presumably offer acclimation during prolonged exposure to butachlor. Contrary to the above, a multitude of down-accumulated proteins vis-a-vis metabolisms augment sensitivity of A. doliolum to butachlor. A cluster of high abundant proteins (atpA, groEL, OR, AGTase, Alr0803, Alr0806, Alr3090, Alr3199, All4050 and All4051) common across the three species may be taken as markers for butachlor tolerance and deserve exploitation for stress management and transgenic development.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cyanobacteria offer an eco-friendly alternative to chemical fertilizers for increasing productivity, especially in rice cultivation. This study is the first to compare the proteome of three diazotrophic cyanobacteria subjected to butachlor, a pre-emergent herbicide extensively used in rice paddy. Changes in protein dynamics over time along with physiological and biochemical attributes clearly provide a comprehensive overview on differential tolerance of Anabaena species to butachlor. Molecular docking further added a new dimension in identification of potential protein candidates for butachlor stress management in cyanobacteria. This study strongly recommends combined application of Anabaena spp. A. L31 and A. PCC7120 as biofertilizer in paddy fields undergoing butachlor treatment.
24520386	Effects of nitrogen application rate and leaf age on the distribution pattern of leaf SPAD readings in the rice canopy.	2014	PLoS One	A Soil-Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter can be used as a simple tool for evaluating N concentration of the leaf and investigating the combined effects of nitrogen rate and leaf age on N distribution. We conducted experiments in a paddy field over two consecutive years (2008-2009) using rice plants treated with six different N application levels. N distribution pattern was determined by SPAD readings based on the temporal dynamics of N concentrations in individual leaves. At 62 days after transplantation (DAT) in 2008 and DAT 60 in 2009, leaf SPAD readings increased from the upper to lower in the rice canopy that received N levels of 150 to 375 kg ha(-1)The differences in SPAD readings between the upper and lower leaf were larger under higher N application rates. However, as plants grew, this atypical distribution of SPAD readings in canopy leaf quickly reversed to the general order. In addition, temporal dynamics of the leaf SPAD readings (N concentrations) were fitted to a piecewise function. In our model, changes in leaf SPAD readings were divided into three stages: growth, functioning, and senescence periods. The leaf growth period lasted approximately 6 days, and cumulative growing days were not affected by N application rates. The leaf functioning period was represented with a relatively stable SPAD reading related to N application rate, and cumulative growing days were extended with increasing N application rates. A quadratic equation was utilized to describe the relationship between SPAD readings and leaf age during the leaf senescence period. The rate of decrease in SPAD readings increased with the age of leaves, but the rate was slowed by N application. As leaves in the lower canopy were physiologically older than leaves in the upper canopy, the rate of decrease in SPAD readings was faster in the lower leaves.
24643567	Protoplast cell death assay to study Magnaporthe oryzae AVR gene function in rice.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	We describe a protocol for transient gene expression in rice protoplasts and its application to the study of Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence (AVR) gene function. In this assay the gene encoding the firefly luciferase protein is transfected into rice protoplasts by electroporation together with the candidate AVR genes. The luminescence can then be used to assess the viability of rice protoplasts. The hypersensitive response (HR) caused by the interaction between M. oryzae AVR and rice R genes can subsequently be monitored by recording the decrease in luminescence from the transfected cells.
24572275	PCR-based assay for rapid and specific detection of the new Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae K3a race using an AFLP-derived marker.	2014	J Microbiol Biotechnol	We describe the development of a polymerase chain reaction method for the rapid, precise, and specific detection of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) K3a race, the bacterial blight pathogen of rice. The specific primer set was designed to amplify a genomic locus derived from an amplified fragment length polymorphism specific for the K3a race. The 1,024 bp amplicon was generated from the DNA of 13 isolates of Xoo K3a races out of 119 isolates of other races, pathovars, and Xanthomonas species. The assay does not require isolated bacterial cells or DNA extraction. Moreover, the pathogen was quickly detected in rice leaf 2 days after inoculation with bacteria and at a distance of 8 cm from the rice leaf 5 days later. The results suggest that this PCR-based assay will be a useful and powerful tool for the detection and identification of the Xoo K3a race in rice plants as well as for early diagnosis of infection in paddy fields.
24482523	Draft Genome Sequence of Pseudomonas nitroreducens Strain TX1, Which Degrades Nonionic Surfactants and Estrogen-Like Alkylphenols.	2014	Genome Announc	Pseudomonas nitroreducens TX1 ATCC PTA-6168 was isolated from rice field drainage in Taiwan. The bacterium is of special interest because of its capability to use nonionic surfactants (alkylphenol polyethoxylates) and estrogen-like compounds (4-t-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol) as a sole carbon source. This is the first report on the genome sequence of P. nitroreducens.
24457353	Genome-wide analysis of radiation-induced mutations in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica).	2014	Mol Biosyst	Radiation has been efficiently used for rice germplasm innovation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which radiation induces mutations are still unclear. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing to reveal the comprehensive mutations in rice treated with radiation. Red-1 (a rice rich in beneficial ingredients for human health) was derived from rice 9311 after γ-radiation. Solexa sequencing technology was applied to uncover the mutations. Compared with the 9311 genome, 9.19% of genome sequences were altered in the Red-1 genome. Among these alterations, there were 381,403 SNPs, 50,116 1-5 bp Indels, 1279 copy number variations, and 10,026 presence/absence variations. These alterations were located in 14,493 genes, the majority of which contained a kinase domain, leucine rich repeats, or Cyt_P450. Point mutations were the main type of variation in the Red-1 genome. Gene ontology clustering revealed that genes that are associated with cell components, binding function, catalytic activity and metabolic processes were susceptible to γ-radiation. It was also predicted that 8 mutated genes were involved in the biosynthetic pathways of beneficial products or pigment accumulation. We conclude that genome-wide analysis of mutations provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which radiation improves the beneficial ingredients in rice Red-1.
24487649	A novel T-DNA integration in rice involving two interchromosomal translocations.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	A male sterile transgenic rice plant TC-19 harboured a novel T-DNA integration in chromosome 8 with two interchromosomal translocations of 6.55 kb chromosome 3 and 29.8 kb chromosome 9 segments. We report a complex Agrobacterium T-DNA integration in rice (Oryza sativa) associated with two interchromosomal translocations. The T-DNA-tagged rice mutant TC-19, which harboured a single copy of the T-DNA, displayed male sterile phenotype in the homozygous condition. Analysis of the junctions between the T-DNA ends and the rice genome by genome walking showed that the right border is flanked by a chromosome 3 sequence and the left border is flanked by a chromosome 9 sequence. Upon further walking on chromosome 3, a chromosome 3/chromosome 8 fusion was detected. Genome walking from the opposite end of the chromosome 8 break point revealed a chromosome 8/chromosome 9 fusion. Our findings revealed that the T-DNA, together with a 6.55-kb region of chromosome 3 and a 29.8-kb region of chromosome 9, was translocated to chromosome 8. Southern blot analysis of the homozygous TC-19 mutant revealed that the native sequences of chromosome 3 and 9 were restored but the disruption of chromosome 8 in the first intron of the gene Os08g0152500 was not restored. The integration of the complex T-DNA in chromosome 8 caused male sterility.
24704987	Functional analysis of the durum wheat gene TdPIP2;1 and its promoter region in response to abiotic stress in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	In a previous work, we demonstrated that expression of TdPIP2;1 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in an increase in Pf compared to water injected oocytes. Phenotypic analyses of transgenic tobacco plants expressing TdPIP2;1 generated a tolerance phenotype towards drought and salinity stresses. To elucidate its stress tolerance mechanism at the transcriptional level, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of the TdPIP2;1 gene. A 1060-bp genomic fragment upstream of the TdPIP2;1 translated sequence has been isolated, cloned, and designated as the proTdPIP2;1 promoter. Sequence analysis of proTdPIP2;1 revealed the presence of cis regulatory elements which could be required for abiotic stress responsiveness, for tissue-specific and vascular expression. The proTdPIP2;1 promoter was fused to the β-glucuronidase (gusA) gene and the resulting construct was transferred into rice (cv. Nipponbare). Histochemical analysis of proTdPIP2;1::Gus in rice plants revealed that the GUS activity was observed in leaves, stems and roots of stably transformed rice T3 plants. Histological sections prepared revealed accumulation of GUS products in phloem, xylem and in some cells adjacent to xylem. The transcripts were up-regulated by dehydration. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing proTdPIP2;1 in fusion with TdPIP2;1, showed enhanced drought tolerance, while wild type plants were more sensitive and exhibited symptoms of wilting and chlorosis. These findings suggest that expression of the TdPIP2;1 gene regulated by its own promoter achieves enhanced drought tolerance in rice.
24602153	From dead leaf, to new life: TAL effectors as tools for synthetic biology.	2014	Plant J	Whether rice, yeast or fly there is barely a model organism not yet reached by transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and their derivative fusion proteins. Insights into fundamental biology are now arriving on the back of work in recent years to develop these proteins as tools for molecular biology. This began with the publication of the simple cipher determining base-specific DNA recognition by TALEs in 2009, and now encompasses a huge variety of established fusion proteins mediating targeted modifications to transcriptome, genome and, recently, epigenome. Straightforward design and exquisite specificity, allowing unique sites to be targeted even within complex eukaryote genomes, are key to the popularity of this system. Synthetic biology is one field that is just beginning to make use of these properties, with a number of recent publications demonstrating TALE-mediated regulation of synthetic genetic circuits. Intense interest has surrounded the CRISPR/Cas9 system within the last 12 months, and it is already proving its mettle as a tool for targeted gene modifications and transcriptional regulation. However, questions over off-target activity and means for independent regulation of multiple Cas9-guide RNA pairs must be resolved before this method can be included in the synthetic biology toolbox. TALEs are already showing promise as regulators of synthetic biological systems, a role that is likely to be developed further in the coming years.
24032447	Overexpression of CaWRKY27, a subgroup IIe WRKY transcription factor of Capsicum annuum, positively regulates tobacco resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum infection.	2014	Physiol Plant	WRKY proteins are encoded by a large gene family and are linked to many biological processes across a range of plant species. The functions and underlying mechanisms of WRKY proteins have been investigated primarily in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. The roles of these transcription factors in non-model plants, including pepper and other Solanaceae, are poorly understood. Here, we characterize the expression and function of a subgroup IIe WRKY protein from pepper (Capsicum annuum), denoted as CaWRKY27. The protein localized to nuclei and activated the transcription of a reporter GUS gene construct driven by the 35S promoter that contained two copies of the W-box in its proximal upstream region. Inoculation of pepper cultivars with Ralstonia solanacearum induced the expression of CaWRKY27 transcript in 76a, a bacterial wilt-resistant pepper cultivar, whereas it downregulated the expression of CaWRKY27 transcript in Gui-1-3, a bacterial wilt-susceptible pepper cultivar. CaWRKY27 transcript levels were also increased by treatments with salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ethephon (ETH). Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing CaWRKY27 exhibited resistance to R. solanacearum infection compared to that of wild-type plants. This resistance was coupled with increased transcript levels in a number of marker genes, including hypersensitive response genes, and SA-, JA- and ET-associated genes. By contrast, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of CaWRKY27 increased the susceptibility of pepper plants to R. solanacearum infection. These results suggest that CaWRKY27 acts as a positive regulator in tobacco resistance responses to R. solanacearum infection through modulation of SA-, JA- and ET-mediated signaling pathways.
24457348	In situ generation of a hydroxyl radical by nanoporous activated carbon derived from rice husk for environmental applications: kinetic and thermodynamic constants.	2014	Phys Chem Chem Phys	The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) generation using nanoporous activated carbon (NPAC), derived from rice husk, and dissolved oxygen in water. The in situ production of the ˙OH radical was confirmed through the DMPO spin trapping method in EPR spectroscopy and quantitative determination by a deoxyribose assay procedure. NPAC served as a heterogeneous catalyst to degrade 2-deoxy-d-ribose (a reference compound) using hydroxyl radical generated from dissolved oxygen in water at temperatures in the range 313-373 K and pH 6, with first order rate constants (k = 9.2 × 10(-2) min(-1), k = 1.2 × 10(-1) min(-1), k = 1.3 × 10(-1) min(-1) and k = 1.68 × 10(-1) min(-1)). The thermodynamic constants for the generation of hydroxyl radicals by NPAC and dissolved oxygen in water were ΔG -1.36 kJ mol(-1) at 313 K, ΔH 17.73 kJ mol(-1) and ΔS 61.01 J mol(-1) K(-1).
24413664	An integrated framework for discovery and genotyping of genomic variants from high-throughput sequencing experiments.	2014	Nucleic Acids Res	Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and computing capacity have produced unprecedented amounts of genomic data that have unraveled the genetics of phenotypic variability in several species. However, operating and integrating current software tools for data analysis still require important investments in highly skilled personnel. Developing accurate, efficient and user-friendly software packages for HTS data analysis will lead to a more rapid discovery of genomic elements relevant to medical, agricultural and industrial applications. We therefore developed Next-Generation Sequencing Eclipse Plug-in (NGSEP), a new software tool for integrated, efficient and user-friendly detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and copy number variants (CNVs). NGSEP includes modules for read alignment, sorting, merging, functional annotation of variants, filtering and quality statistics. Analysis of sequencing experiments in yeast, rice and human samples shows that NGSEP has superior accuracy and efficiency, compared with currently available packages for variants detection. We also show that only a comprehensive and accurate identification of repeat regions and CNVs allows researchers to properly separate SNVs from differences between copies of repeat elements. We expect that NGSEP will become a strong support tool to empower the analysis of sequencing data in a wide range of research projects on different species.
24554438	Interaction of gypsum and the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides plays an important role in anti-allergic effects of byakkokakeishito in mice.	2014	J Nat Med	Gypsum is a crude mineral drug used in the formulas of Japanese kampo medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-allergic effect of byakkokakeishito extract (BKT), which consists of gypsum (natural hydrous calcium sulfate), Anemarrhena Rhizome (rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides), Cinnamon Bark (bark of trunk of Cinnamomum cassia), Oriza Seed (seed of Oryza sativa), and Glycyrrhiza (root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and to clarify the role of gypsum in the formula. We prepared BKT by boiling a mixture of various quantities of gypsum and fixed amounts of the other four crude drugs in water. We evaluated the anti-allergic activity of the formulations using three different murine models of allergy: contact dermatitis induced by painting hapten onto skin; allergic dermatitis-like symptoms induced by cutaneous injection of mite-antigen; and skin passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction using ovalbumin as antigen. The calcium content in the various BKT samples was dose-dependently increased up to 60 g/day of human dosage. BKT significantly suppressed the allergic symptoms in the three different experimental models. The effect of BKT was augmented by increasing the gypsum dosage only in the PCA reaction model. The extract prepared from a mixture of Anemarrhena Rhizome and gypsum exhibited an effect comparable to that of BKT. BKT exhibits an anti-allergic effect in several animal models, which may provide experimental evidence for the clinical use of BKT in allergic diseases. Gypsum may augment the anti-allergic activity of BKT, presumably through increasing intestinal absorption of Anemarrhena Rhizome-derived active constituents.
24518221	Time-series RNA-seq analysis package (TRAP) and its application to the analysis of rice, Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica, upon drought stress.	2014	Methods	Measuring expression levels of genes at the whole genome level can be useful for many purposes, especially for revealing biological pathways underlying specific phenotype conditions. When gene expression is measured over a time period, we have opportunities to understand how organisms react to stress conditions over time. Thus many biologists routinely measure whole genome level gene expressions at multiple time points. However, there are several technical difficulties for analyzing such whole genome expression data. In addition, these days gene expression data is often measured by using RNA-sequencing rather than microarray technologies and then analysis of expression data is much more complicated since the analysis process should start with mapping short reads and produce differentially activated pathways and also possibly interactions among pathways. In addition, many useful tools for analyzing microarray gene expression data are not applicable for the RNA-seq data. Thus a comprehensive package for analyzing time series transcriptome data is much needed. In this article, we present a comprehensive package, Time-series RNA-seq Analysis Package (TRAP), integrating all necessary tasks such as mapping short reads, measuring gene expression levels, finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs), clustering and pathway analysis for time-series data in a single environment. In addition to implementing useful algorithms that are not available for RNA-seq data, we extended existing pathway analysis methods, ORA and SPIA, for time series analysis and estimates statistical values for combined dataset by an advanced metric. TRAP also produces visual summary of pathway interactions. Gene expression change labeling, a practical clustering method used in TRAP, enables more accurate interpretation of the data when combined with pathway analysis. We applied our methods on a real dataset for the analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica nipponbare) upon drought stress. The result showed that TRAP was able to detect pathways more accurately than several existing methods. TRAP is available at http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/TRAP/.
24584576	Population structure and genetic diversity analysis of Indian and exotic rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions using SSR markers.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	In order to understand the population structure and genetic diversity among a set of 82 rice genotypes collected from different parts of the Asian countries including India were characterized using 39 microsatellite loci. The Population structure analysis suggested that the optimum number of subpopulations was four (K = 4) among the rice genotypes, whereas phylogenetic analysis grouped them into three populations. The results obtained from phylogenetic and STRUCTURE analysis proved to be very powerful for the differentiation of rice genotypes based on their place of origin. The genetic diversity analysis using 39 SSR loci yielded 183 scorable alleles, out of which 182 alleles were observed to be polymorphic with an average of 4.8 alleles per locus. The Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) values for all the polymorphic primers across 82 rice genotypes varied from 0.02 to 0.77, with an average of 0.50. Gene diversity (He) was found to be in the range of 0.02 (RM484) to 0.80 (OSR13) with an average value of 0.55, while heterozygosity (Ho) was observed with an average of 0.07, ranging from 0.01 (RM334) to 0.31 (RM316). The present study resulted in identification of seven highly polymorphic SSR loci viz., OSR13, RM152, RM144, RM536, RM489, RM259 and RM271 based on the parameters like PIC value (≥ 0.70), gene diversity (≥ 0.71), and polymorphic alleles (≥ 6). These seven polymorphic primers can effectively be used in further molecular breeding programs and QTL mapping studies of rice since they exhibited very high polymorphism over other loci. SSR analysis resulted in a more definitive separation of clustering of genotypes indicating a higher level of efficiency of SSR markers for the accurate determination of relationships between accessions.
24656332	Orysata, a jacalin-related lectin from rice, could protect plants against biting-chewing and piercing-sucking insects.	2014	Plant Sci	The present study reports the insecticidal activity of Orysata, a lectin from rice with mannose specificity, belonging to the family of jacalin-related lectins. The effect of Orysata was investigated against three important pest insects in agriculture: the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and two aphid pests: green peach aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer and pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea). Bioassays with S. exigua and M. persicae were performed using detached leaves from transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing Orysata. The expression levels ranged between 38 and 71 μg/g FW, corresponding to 0.6-1.1% of total soluble protein. Intoxicated larval stages of S. exigua revealed significant mortality, reductions in larval weight gain and a retardation of development. Similarly, feeding on leaves expressing Orysata lowered the mortality of the green peach aphids significantly. When pea aphids were fed on an artificial diet supplemented with different amounts of recombinant Orysata, mortality was high at relatively low lectin concentrations; the estimated 50% lethal concentration being 79 μg/ml. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the jacalin-related lectin Orysata possesses strong insecticidal activity, suggesting that it can be considered as a valuable candidate to be used as a control agent against both biting-chewing and piercing-sucking pest insects.
24399024	Diversity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with pulse crops in different agro-ecological regions of India.	2014	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Four hundred seventy Rhizoctonia solani isolates from different leguminous hosts originating from 16 agro-ecological regions of India covering 21 states and 72 districts were collected. The disease incidence caused by R. solani varied from 6.8 to 22.2 % in the areas surveyed. Deccan plateau and central highlands, hot sub-humid ecoregion followed by northern plain and central highlands and hot semi-arid ecoregion showed the highest disease incidence. R. solani isolates were highly variable in growth diameter, number, size and pattern of sclerotia formation as well as hyphal width. The isolates obtained from aerial part of the infected plants showing web blight symptoms produced sclerotia of 1-2 mm in size whereas, the isolates obtained from infected root of the plants showing wet root rot symptoms produced microsclerotia (<1 mm). Majority of R. solani isolates showed <8 μm hyphal diameter. Based on morphological characters the isolates were categorized into 49 groups. Seven anastomosis groups (AGs) were identified among the populations of R. solani associated with the pulse crops. The frequency (25.6 %) of AG3 was the highest followed by AG2-3 (20.9 %) and AG5 (17.4 %). The cropping sequence of rice/sorghum/wheat-chickpea/mungbean/urdbean/cowpea/ricebean influenced the dominance of AG1 (16.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis utilizing ITS-5.8S rDNA gene sequences indicated high level of genetic similarity among isolates representing different AGs, crops and regions. ITS groups did not correspond to the morphological characters. The sequence data from this article has been deposited with NCBI data libraries with JF701707 to JF701795 accession numbers.
24218206	MeRy-B, a metabolomic database and knowledge base for exploring plant primary metabolism.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	Plant primary metabolites are organic compounds that are common to all or most plant species and are essential for plant growth, development, and reproduction. They are intermediates and products of metabolism involved in photosynthesis and other biosynthetic processes. Primary metabolites belong to different compound families, mainly carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, steroids, or lipids. Until recently, unlike the Human Metabolome Database ( http://www.hmdb.ca ) dedicated to human metabolism, there was no centralized database or repository dedicated exclusively to the plant kingdom that contained information on metabolites and their concentrations in a detailed experimental context. MeRy-B is the first platform for plant (1)H-NMR metabolomic profiles (MeRy-B, http://bit.ly/meryb ), designed to provide a knowledge base of curated plant profiles and metabolites obtained by NMR, together with the corresponding experimental and analytical metadata. MeRy-B contains lists of plant metabolites, mostly primary metabolites and unknown compounds, with information about experimental conditions, the factors studied, and metabolite concentrations for 19 different plant species (Arabidopsis, broccoli, daphne, grape, maize, barrel clover, melon, Ostreococcus tauri, palm date, palm tree, peach, pine tree, eucalyptus, plantain rice, strawberry, sugar beet, tomato, vanilla), compiled from more than 2,300 annotated NMR profiles for various organs or tissues deposited by 30 different private or public contributors in September 2013. Currently, about half of the data deposited in MeRy-B is publicly available. In this chapter, readers will be shown how to (1) navigate through and retrieve data of publicly available projects on MeRy-B website; (2) visualize lists of experimentally identified metabolites and their concentrations in all plant species present in MeRy-B; (3) get primary metabolite list for a particular plant species in MeRy-B; and for a particular tissue (4) find information on a primary metabolite regardless of the species.
24453041	Genome-wide evolutionary characterization and expression analyses of WRKY family genes in Brachypodium distachyon.	2014	DNA Res	Members of plant WRKY gene family are ancient transcription factors that function in plant growth and development and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. In our present study, we have investigated WRKY family genes in Brachypodium distachyon, a new model plant of family Poaceae. We identified a total of 86 WRKY genes from B. distachyon and explored their chromosomal distribution and evolution, domain alignment, promoter cis-elements, and expression profiles. Combining the analysis of phylogenetic tree of BdWRKY genes and the result of expression profiling, results showed that most of clustered gene pairs had higher similarities in the WRKY domain, suggesting that they might be functionally redundant. Neighbour-joining analysis of 301 WRKY domains from Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, and B. distachyon suggested that BdWRKY domains are evolutionarily more closely related to O. sativa WRKY domains than those of A. thaliana. Moreover, tissue-specific expression profile of BdWRKY genes and their responses to phytohormones and several biotic or abiotic stresses were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the expression of BdWRKY genes was rapidly regulated by stresses and phytohormones, and there was a strong correlation between promoter cis-elements and the phytohormones-induced BdWRKY gene expression.
24418273	Dietary preference in dairy calves for feed ingredients high in energy and protein.	2014	J Dairy Sci	In 3 experiments, we assessed preference of recently weaned dairy calves for (1) 8 high-energy feed types [barley meal, corn meal, corn gluten feed (CGF), oat meal, rice meal, sorghum meal, wheat meal, and wheat middlings meal]; (2) 6 high-protein feed types [corn gluten meal (CGM), wheat distillers dried grains, rapeseed meal, soybean meal (SBM), sunflower meal, and pea meal]; and (3) 4 mixtures (50:50) of the highest- and lowest-ranked high-energy and high-protein feeds, to assess whether calves maintain preference for feed ingredients that are included in a mixture. In all experiments, pairwise preference tests were conducted between all feed types (28 different pairwise preference tests in experiment 1, 15 tests in experiment 2, and 6 tests in experiment 3). Each pairwise preference test was conducted by offering ad libitum access to both feed types for 6h. All tests were repeated with 20 Holstein calves. Before this study, calves were offered milk replacer at a rate of 4 L/d and a pelleted starter feed ad libitum. After weaning at 62 d of age, each calf was involved in a pairwise preference test at 3 and 5d postweaning. A preference ratio was calculated for each calf in each test as (intake of feed type A)/(intake of feed type A + intake of feed type B). Preference for feed types was ranked across tests in each experiment using pairwise comparison charts. In experiment 1, the highest-ranked high-energy feed type was wheat meal and the lowest ranked were rice meal and CGF. In experiment 2, the highest-ranked high-protein feed type was SBM and the lowest ranked was CGM. According to the preference rankings from experiments 1 and 2, experiment 3 evaluated (50:50) mixtures of SBM + wheat meal, SBM + CGF, CGM + wheat meal, and CGM + CGF. The mixture of SBM + wheat meal was highest ranked, CGM + CGF was lowest ranked, and the mixtures containing one high-ranked and one low-ranked feed ingredient (SBM + CGF and CGM + wheat meal) were ranked equally. The results of this study indicate that young calves exhibit clear preferences for certain high-energy and high-protein feeds that may be considered highly palatable. Further, preference ranking of feed types provided as 50:50 mixtures was consistent with ranking of individual feed types, suggesting that palatability of mixed starter rations can be improved by inclusion of a preferred feed type.
24415207	Genome-wide DNA polymorphism and transcriptome analysis of an early-maturing rice mutant.	2014	Genetica	In order to develop a rice population with improved important traits such as flowering time, we developed 2,911 M2 targeting-induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) lines by irradiating rice seeds with γ-rays. In all, 15 M3 lines were obtained from 3 different M2 lines that exhibited an early-maturing phenotype: these plants matured approximately 25 days faster than wild-type (WT) plants. To identify genome-wide DNA polymorphisms, we performed whole-genome resequencing of both the plant types, i.e., WT and early-maturing TILLING 1 (EMT1), and obtained mapped reads of 118,488,245 bp (99.53 %) and 128,489,860 bp (99.72 %), respectively; Nipponbare was used as the reference genome. We obtained 63,648 and 147,728 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 33,474 and 31,082 insertions and deletions (InDels) for the WT and EMT1, respectively. Interestingly, there was a higher number of SNPs (2.6-fold) and slightly lower number of InDels (0.9-fold) in EMT1 than in WT. The expression of at least 202 structurally altered genes was changed in EMT1, and functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed that their molecular functions were related to flower development. These results might provide a critical insight into the regulatory pathways of rice flowering.
24659814	Evidence for selection on gene expression in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Mol Biol Evol	Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether gene regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, Oryza sativa. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in genes' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those genes' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several genes that share Gene Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase gene expression relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of cis-trans pairs of eQTL alleles that affect gene expression in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all cis-trans pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect gene expression, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of genes with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 cis-trans pairs with strong trans eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate genes under positive selection accurately predict phenotypic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.
24727355	Engineered hydrochar composites for phosphorus removal/recovery: Lanthanum doped hydrochar prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of lanthanum pretreated rice straw.	2014	Bioresour Technol	Engineered hydrochar composites (EHC) were synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of lanthanum pretreated rice straw. The as-prepared composite with about 30% lanthanum content showed greater P removal potential than La(OH)3, indicating the synergistic effect of hydrochar and lanthanum in P removal. The adsorption results showed that EHC showed great P adsorption capacities (>50mgPg(-1)) in the pH range of 2.5-10.5, and the presence of competing anions had little negative effects on P adsorption on EHC. The equilibrium time for P adsorption on EHC was considerably reduced under acid condition (12h) compared to alkaline condition (48h). The maximum adsorption capacity was 61.57mgPg(-1) according to Langmuir isotherms. These results suggested that EHC was highly effective in P adsorption in a wide range of pH and the presence of competing anions, thus EHC could be a promising adsorbent for phosphorus removal/recovery from wastewater.
24633442	Insights into Monascus biology at the genetic level.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The genus of Monascus was nominated by van Tieghem in 1884, but its fermented product-red mold rice (RMR), namely red yeast rice, has been used as folk medicines, food colorants, and fermentation starters for more than thousands of years in oriental countries. Nowadays, RMR is widely developed as food supplements around the world due to its functional compounds such as monacolin K (MK, also called lovastatin) and γ-aminobutyric acid. But the usage of RMR also incurs controversy resulting from contamination of citrinin (a kind of mycotoxin) produced by some Monascus strains. In the past decade, it has made great progress to Monascus spp. at the genetic level with the application of molecular biology techniques to restrain the citrinin production and increase the yields of MK and pigment in RMR, as well as aid Monascus classification and phylogenesis. Up to now, hundreds of papers about Monascus molecular biology (MMB) have been published in the international primary journals. However, to our knowledge, there is no MMB review issued until now. In this review, current understanding of Monascus spp. from the view of molecular biology will be covered and insights into research areas that need to be further investigated will also be discussed.
24462689	GC content fluctuation around plant small RNA-generating sites.	2014	FEBS Lett	GC content of small RNA-generating sites and their flanking sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice was systematically analyzed in silico. High GC content fluctuation (GCF) is observed at the borders of sRNA sites, while the GCF within sRNA sites is low. Furthermore, the GC content along sequences of some miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) families coincides with the abundance of MITE-derived small RNAs. The GCF within tasiRNA clusters is negatively correlated with its phasing score. We conclude that high GC content and low GCF could increase the expression of small RNA. Our results provide further insights on small RNA expression, which may be applied to improve the silencing efficiency of RNAi and virus-induced gene silencing.
24466314	Specific expression of DR5 promoter in rice roots using a tCUP derived promoter-reporter system.	2014	PLoS One	Variation of transgene expression caused by either position effect at the insertion site or the promoter/enhancer elements employed for the expression of selectable marker genes has complicated phenotype characterization and caused misinterpretation. We have developed a reporter system in rice to analyze the influence of vector configuration, spacer and selectable marker gene promoter on the expression of the promoterless GUS reporter and DR5 promoter. Our results indicate that a spacer inserted between the reversed 35S promoter and the GUS reporter could reduce leaky expression of the reporter but was unable to block the nonspecific expression of DR5::GUS. Stacking the selectable marker unit in head to tail with the GUS reporter aided the gene specific expression of the GUS reporter under the DR5 promoter even when the 35S promoter is used for expression of the selectable marker. Compared to 35S under this configuration, a quick and distinctive expression of DR5::GUS was observed in the root cap, quiescent center and xylem cells in the root apical meristem by using the tCUP derived promoter (tCUP1) for selection, that is similar to the pattern obtained by a sensitive DR5 variant (DR5rev) in Arabidopsis. These data suggest a conserved property of the tCUP promoter in preventing enhancer-promoter interactions in rice as it does in Arabidopsis, and also demonstrate that an analogous distal auxin maximum exists in roots of rice. Therefore, the tCUP promoter based selection system provides a new strategy for specific expression of transgenes in rice.
24466254	Pollen and phytolith evidence for rice cultivation and vegetation change during the mid-late holocene at the Jiangli site, Suzhou, East China.	2014	PLoS One	Pollen and phytolith analyses were undertaken at the Jiangli site in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, combined with studies on macrofossils by flotation. The concentration of pollen decreased while the percentage of Poaceae pollen in the profile increased from the late phase of the Majiabang Culture to the Songze Culture suggesting that human impact on the local environment intensified gradually. The discovery of rice paddy implies a relatively advanced rice cultivation in this area during the middle-late Holocene. Other than phytoliths, the high percentage of Oryza-type Poaceae pollen (larger than 40 µm) supplied robust evidence for the existence of rice paddy. Moreover, the fact that the farther from the rice paddy, the lower the concentration and percentage of Poaceae pollen also proves that the dispersal and deposition of pollen is inversely proportional to the distance.
23706976	Associations between dietary patterns and kidney function indicators in type 2 diabetes.	2014	Clin Nutr	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary patterns link to risks for chronic diseases. Few studies explore relationships between dietary patterns and kidney function in adult type 2 diabetes in Asian.

METHODS: Diabetic patients (n = 635) were selected from a cohort participating in a diabetic control study in Taiwan. Three dietary patterns, high fat (meats, processed meats, seafood, fatty foods, eggs), vegetable and fish (light- or dark- colored vegetables, pond and marine fish) and traditional Chinese-snack (soy/gluten products, rice, noodles, root vegetables, nuts), were generated using factor analysis. Urinary albumin to creatinine (ACR), creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) served as clinical indicators of kidney function.

RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, tertile scores of vegetable and fish dietary patterns correlated significantly (p-trend = 0.032) and dose-responsively with multivariable-adjusted means of decreased creatinine and marginally with increased eGFR (p- trend = 0.065). Traditional Chinese-snack dietary pattern was marginally associated with creatinine (p-trend = 0.065) and eGFR (p-trend = 0.064). High fat dietary patterns did not correlate with any kidney function indicator.

CONCLUSIONS: Healthy diets such as frequent intake of fish and vegetable may be related to indicators of better kidney function in type 2 diabetes. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes and use of sensitive indicators for studying early renal function decline are needed to confirm this association.
24489765	RNA interference depletion of the Halloween gene disembodied implies its potential application for management of planthopper Sogatella furcifera and Laodelphax striatellus.	2014	PLoS One	Sogatella furcifera and Laodelphax striatellus are economically important rice pests in China by acting as vectors of several rice viruses, sucking the phloem sap and blocking the phloem vessels. Ecdysteroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone regulates insect development and reproduction. A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP302A1 (22-hydroxylase), encoded by the Halloween gene disembodied (dib), plays a critical role in ecdysteroidogenesis. The objective of this study is to test whether dib genes are potential targets for RNA interference-based management of S. furcifera and L. striatellus. We cloned and characterized Sfdib and Lsdib. The open reading frame regions of dib genes were generated and used for designing and constructing dsRNA fragments. Experiments were conducted using oral delivery of dsdib to investigate the effectiveness of RNAi in S. furcifera and L. striatellus nymphs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated that continuous ingestion of dsdib at the concentration of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.50 mg/ml diminished Sfdib expression levels by 35.9%, 45.1% and 66.2%, and ecdysone receptor (SfEcR) gene mRNA levels by 34.0%, 36.2% and 58.5% respectively in S. furcifera, and decreased Lsdib expression level by 18.8%, 35.8% and 56.7%, and LsEcR mRNA levels by 25.2%, 46.8% and 68.8% respectively in L. striatellus. The reduction in dib and EcR transcript abundance resulted in observable phenotypes. The development of nymphs was impaired and the survival was negatively affected. Our data will enable the development of new insect control strategies and functional analysis of vital genes in S. furcifera and L. striatellus nymphs.
24516534	Transcriptional profiling of nitrogen fixation and the role of NifA in the diazotrophic endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72.	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The model endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 is known to contribute fixed nitrogen to its host Kallar grass and also expresses nitrogenase genes endophytically in rice seedlings. Availability of nitrogen is a signal regulating the transcription of nitrogenase genes. Therefore, we analysed global transcription in response to differences in the nitrogen source.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A DNA microarray, comprising 70-mer oligonucleotides representing 3989 open reading frames of the genome of strain BH72, was used for transcriptome studies. Transcription profiles of cells grown microaerobically on N2 versus ammonium were compared. Expression of 7.2% of the genes was significantly up-regulated, and 5.8% down-regulated upon N2 fixation, respectively. A parallel genome-wide prediction of σ(54)-type promoter elements mapped to the upstream region of 38 sequences of which 36 were modulated under the N2 response. In addition to modulation of genes related to N2 fixation, the expressions of gene clusters that might be related to plant-microbe interaction and of several transcription factors were significantly enhanced. While comparing under N2-fixation conditions the transcriptome of wild type with a nifLA(-) insertion mutant, NifA being the essential transcriptional activator for nif genes, 24.5% of the genome was found to be affected in expression. A genome-wide prediction of 29 NifA binding sequences matched to 25 of the target genes whose expression was differential during microarray analysis, some of which were putatively negatively regulated by NifA. For selected genes, differential expression was corroborated by real time RT-PCR studies.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that life under conditions of nitrogen fixation is an important part of the lifestyle of strain BH72 in roots, as a wide range of genes far beyond the nif regulon is modulated. Moreover, the NifA regulon in strain BH72 appears to encompass a wider range of cellular functions beyond the regulation of nif genes.
24492469	WRKY transcription factors: Jack of many trades in plants.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	WRKY transcription factors are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators found exclusively in plants. They have diverse biological functions in plant disease resistance, abiotic stress responses, nutrient deprivation, senescence, seed and trichome development, embryogenesis, as well as additional developmental and hormone-controlled processes. WRKYs can act as transcriptional activators or repressors, in various homo- and heterodimer combinations. Here we review recent progress on the function of WRKY transcription factors in Arabidopsis and other plant species such as rice, potato, and parsley, with a special focus on abiotic, developmental, and hormone-regulated processes.
24531270	Caecal environment of rats fed far East Asian-modelled diets.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	To clarify the effect of type of foods on the intestinal environment, Far East Asian- (FEA; rich in rice starch, soy protein and soy oil) and Far East Asian marine- (FEAM; rich in rice starch, fish meal, fish oil and brown alga) modelled diets and sucrose, casein and beef tallow-rich (SCB) diet were prepared. After the 2-week administration of diets in rats, caecal organic acids and putrefactive compounds (ammonia, indole, phenol and H2S, which are regarded as putative risk factors for tumours) were determined. The caecal microbiota was also analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing with bar-coded primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Levels of n-butyrate, acetate, indole and phenol were high in rats fed FEA. On the other hand, H2S was clearly suppressed by both FEA and FEAM comparing with SCB. These results suggest that FEAM is preferable to FEA for optimal intestinal environment and host health. Both microbial analyses showed that the diversity of microbiota in the FEAM group was lower than in the other diet groups. Ratio of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the SCB group was about 5:4:1. Firmicutes, particularly Lachnospiraceae, was promoted by FEA and FEAM.
24586434	Effects of different tillage and straw return on soil organic carbon in a rice-wheat rotation system.	2014	PLoS One	Soil management practices, such as tillage method or straw return, could alter soil organic carbon (C) contents. However, the effects of tillage method or straw return on soil organic C (SOC) have showed inconsistent results in different soil/climate/cropping systems. The Yangtze River Delta of China is the main production region of rice and wheat, and rice-wheat rotation is the most important cropping system in this region. However, few studies in this region have been conducted to assess the effects of different tillage methods combined with straw return on soil labile C fractions in the rice-wheat rotation system. In this study, a field experiment was used to evaluate the effects of different tillage methods, straw return and their interaction on soil total organic C (TOC) and labile organic C fractions at three soil depths (0-7, 7-14 and 14-21 cm) for a rice-wheat rotation in Yangzhong of the Yangtze River Delta of China. Soil TOC, easily oxidizable C (EOC), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) contents were measured in this study. Soil TOC and labile organic C fractions contents were significantly affected by straw returns, and were higher under straw return treatments than non-straw return at three depths. At 0-7 cm depth, soil MBC was significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage, but EOC was just opposite. Rotary tillage had significantly higher soil TOC than plowing tillage at 7-14 cm depth. However, at 14-21 cm depth, TOC, DOC and MBC were significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage except for EOC. Consequently, under short-term condition, rice and wheat straw both return in rice-wheat rotation system could increase SOC content and improve soil quality in the Yangtze River Delta.
24505334	Field efficacy of Vectobac GR as a mosquito larvicide for the control of anopheline and culicine mosquitoes in natural habitats in Benin, West Africa.	2014	PLoS One	INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of Vectobac GR (potency 200 ITU/mg), a new formulation of bacterial larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis Strain AM65-52, was evaluated against Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus in simulated field and natural habitats in Benin.

METHODS: In simulated field conditions, Vectobac GR formulation was tested at 3 dosages (0.6, 0.9, 1.2 g granules/m² against An. gambiae and 1, 1.5, 2 g granules/m² against Cx. quinquefasciatus) according to manufacturer's product label recommendations. The dosage giving optimum efficacy under simulated field conditions were evaluated in the field. The efficacy of Vectobac GR in terms of emergence inhibition in simulated field conditions and of reduction of larval and pupal densities in rice fields and urban cesspits was measured following WHO guidelines for testing and evaluation of mosquito larvicides.

RESULTS: Vectobac GR caused emergence inhibition of ≥80% until 21 [20]-[22] days for An. gambiae at 1.2 g/m² dose and 28 [27-29] days for Cx. quinquefasciatus at 2 g/m² in simulated field habitats. The efficacy of Vectobac GR in natural habitats was for 2 to 3 days against larvae and up to 10 days against pupae.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Vectobac GR caused complete control of immature mosquito within 2-3 days but did not show prolonged residual action. Larviciding can be an option for malaria and filariasis vector control particularly in managing pyrethroid-resistance in African malaria vectors. Since use of larvicides among several African countries is being emphasized through Economic Community of West Africa States, their epidemiological impact should be carefully investigated.
24409328	Use of a pollen-based diet to expose the ladybird beetle Propylea japonica to insecticidal proteins.	2014	PLoS One	A rape seed pollen-based diet was developed and found to be suitable for use in a dietary exposure assay for Propylea japonica. Using the diet, we established and validated a dietary exposure assay by using the protease inhibitor E-64 as positive control. Dose-dependent responses were documented for all observed life-table parameters of P. japonica including survival, pupation and eclosion rates, development time and adult weight. Results suggested that the dietary assay can detect the effects of insecticidal compounds on the survival and development of P. japonica. Using the established dietary assay, we subsequently tested the toxicity of Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F proteins that are expressed by transgenic maize, cotton or rice plants to P. japonica larvae. The diet containing E-64 was included as a positive control. Survival and development of P. japonica larvae were not adversely affected when the diet contained purified Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, or Cry1F at 500 µg/g diet representing a worst-case exposure scenario. In contrast, P. japonica larvae were adversely affected when the diet contained E-64. The bioactivity and stability of the Cry proteins in the diet and Cry protein uptake by the ladybird larvae were confirmed by bioassay with a Cry-sensitive insect species and by ELISA. The current study describes a suitable experimental system for assessing the potential effects of gut-active insecticidal compounds on ladybird beetle larvae. The experiments with the Cry proteins demonstrate that P. japonica larvae are not sensitive to Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F.
24414128	Deep re-sequencing of a widely used maintainer line of hybrid rice for discovery of DNA polymorphisms and evaluation of genetic diversity.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Genetic diversity within parental lines of hybrid rice is the foundation of heterosis utilization and yield improvement. Previous studies have suggested that genetic diversity was narrow in cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS/A line) and restorer lines (R line) for Three-line hybrid rice. However, the genetic diversity within maintainer lines (B line), especially at a genome-wide scale, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we performed deep re-sequencing of the elite maintainer line V20B (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica). We then compared the V20B sequence with the 93-11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) genome sequence. 112.1 × 106 paired-end reads (PE reads) were generated with approximately 30-fold sequencing depth. The V20B PE reads uniquely covered 87.6 % of the 93-11 genome sequence. Overall, a total of 660,778 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 266,301 insertions and deletions (InDels) were identified, yielding an average of 2.1 SNPs/kb and 0.8 InDels/kb. Genome-wide distribution of the SNPs and InDels was non-random, and variation-rich and variation-poor regions were identified in all chromosomes. A total of 20,562 non-synonymous SNPs spanning 8,854 genes were annotated. Our results identified DNA polymorphisms at the genome-wide scale and uncovered the high level of genetic diversity between V20B and 93-11. Our results proved that next-generation sequencing technologies can be powerful tools to study genome-wide DNA polymorphisms, to query genetic diversity, and to enable molecular improvement efforts with Three-line hybrid rice. Further, our results also indicated that 93-11 could be used as core germplasm for the improvement of wild-abortive CMS lines and the maintainer lines.
24571491	Identification and fine mapping of quantitative trait loci for seed vigor in germination and seedling establishment in rice.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Seed vigor is an index of seed quality that is used to describe the rapid and uniform germination and the establishment of strong seedlings in any environmental conditions. Strong seed vigor in low-temperature germination conditions is particularly important in direct-sowing rice production systems. However, seed vigor has not been selected as an important breeding trait in traditional breeding programs due to its quantitative inherence. In this study, we identified and mapped eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed vigor by using a recombinant inbred population from a cross between rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) cultivars ZS97 and MH63. Conditional QTL analysis identified qSV-1, qSV-5b, qSV-6a, qSV-6b, and qSV-11 influenced seedling establishment and that qSV-5a, qSV-5c, and qSV-8 influenced only germination. Of these, qSV-1, qSV-5b, qSV-6a, qSV-6b, and qSV-8 were low-temperature-specific QTLs. Two major-effective QTLs, qSV-1, and qSV-5c were narrowed down to 1.13-Mbp and 400-kbp genomic regions, respectively. The results provide tightly linked DNA markers for the marker-assistant pyramiding of multiple positive alleles for increased seed vigor in both normal and low-temperature germination environments.
24682459	Application of T-DNA activation tagging to identify glutamate receptor-like genes that enhance drought tolerance in plants.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: A high-quality rice activation tagging population has been developed and screened for drought-tolerant lines using various water stress assays. One drought-tolerant line activated two rice glutamate receptor-like genes. Transgenic overexpression of the rice glutamate receptor-like genes conferred drought tolerance to rice and Arabidopsis. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a multi-billion dollar crop grown in more than one hundred countries, as well as a useful functional genetic tool for trait discovery. We have developed a population of more than 200,000 activation-tagged rice lines for use in forward genetic screens to identify genes that improve drought tolerance and other traits that improve yield and agronomic productivity. The population has an expected coverage of more than 90 % of rice genes. About 80 % of the lines have a single T-DNA insertion locus and this molecular feature simplifies gene identification. One of the lines identified in our screens, AH01486, exhibits improved drought tolerance. The AH01486 T-DNA locus is located in a region with two glutamate receptor-like genes. Constitutive overexpression of either glutamate receptor-like gene significantly enhances the drought tolerance of rice and Arabidopsis, thus revealing a novel function of this important gene family in plant biology.
24603905	Transovarial transmission of a plant virus is mediated by vitellogenin of its insect vector.	2014	PLoS Pathog	Most plant viruses are transmitted by hemipteroid insects. Some viruses can be transmitted from female parent to offspring usually through eggs, but the mechanism of this transovarial transmission remains unclear. Rice stripe virus (RSV), a Tenuivirus, transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus), is also spread to the offspring through the eggs. Here, we used the RSV-planthopper system as a model to investigate the mechanism of transovarial transmission and demonstrated the central role of vitellogenin (Vg) of L. striatellus in the process of virus transmission into the eggs. Our data showed Vg can bind to pc3 in vivo and in vitro and colocalize in the germarium. RSV filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) only accumulated in the terminal filaments and pedicel areas prior to Vg expression and was not present in the germarium until Vg was expressed, where RSV RNPs and Vg had colocalized. Observations by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) also indicated that these two proteins colocalized in nurse cells. Knockdown of Vg expression due to RNA interference resulted in inhibition of the invasion of ovarioles by RSV. Together, the data obtained indicated that RSV RNPs may enter the nurse cell of the germarium via endocytosis through binding with Vg. Finally, the virus enters the oocytes through nutritive cords, using the same route as for Vg transport. Our results show that the Vg of L. striatellus played a critical role in transovarial transmission of RSV and shows how viruses can use existing transovarial transportation systems in insect vectors for their own purposes.
24523924	Nonstructural protein NS4 of Rice Stripe Virus plays a critical role in viral spread in the body of vector insects.	2014	PLoS One	Rice stripe virus (RSV), a tenuivirus, is transmitted by small brown planthopper (SBPH) in a persistent-propagative manner. In this study, sequential infection of RSV in the internal organs of SBPH after ingestion of virus indicated that RSV initially infected the midgut epithelium, and then progressed to the visceral muscle tissues, through which RSV spread to the entire alimentary canal. Finally, RSV spread into the salivary glands and reproductive system. During viral infection, the nonstructural protein NS4 of RSV formed cytoplasmic inclusions in various tissues of viruliferous SBPH. We demonstrated that the ribonucleoprotein particles of RSV were closely associated with NS4-specific inclusions in the body of viruliferous SBPH through a direct interaction between NS4 and nucleoprotein of RSV. Moreover, the knockdown of NS4 expression due to RNA interference induced by dsRNA from NS4 gene significantly prevented the spread of RSV in the bodies of SBPHs without a significant effect on viral replication in continuous cell culture derived from SBPH. All these results suggest that the nonstructural protein NS4 of RSV plays a critical role in viral spread by the vector insects.
24300846	A growth inhibitory model with SO(x) influenced effective growth rate for estimation of algal biomass concentration under flue gas atmosphere.	2014	Bioresour Technol	A theoretical model for the prediction of biomass concentration under rice husk flue gas emission has been developed. The growth inhibitory model (GIM) considers the CO2 mass transfer rate, the critical SOx concentration and its role in pH-based inter-conversion of bicarbonate. The calibration and subsequent validation of the growth profile of Nannochloropsis limnetica at 2% and 10% (v/v) CO2 showed that the predicted values were consistent with the measured values, with r(2) being 0.96 and 0.98, respectively, and p<0.001 in both cases. The constants used in the GIM for the prediction of biomass have been justified using sensitivity analysis. GIM applicability was defined as ±30% of the calibrated flow rate (3.0 L min(-1)). This growth model can be applied to predict algal growth in photo-bioreactors treated with flue gas in the generation of biomass feed stock for biofuel production.
24664256	Expression patterns of conserved microRNAs in the male gametophyte of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda).	2014	Plant Reprod	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate genes involved in various aspects of plant development, but their presence and expression patterns in the male gametophytes of gymnosperms have not yet been established. Therefore, this study identified and compared the expression patterns of conserved miRNAs from two stages of the male gametophyte of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), which are the mature (ungerminated) and germinated pollen. Microarray was used to identify conserved miRNAs that varied in expression between these two stages of the loblolly pine male gametophyte. Forty-seven conserved miRNAs showed significantly different expression levels between mature and germinated loblolly pine pollen. In particular, miRNAs representing 14 and 8 families were up- and down-regulated in germinated loblolly pine pollen, respectively. qRT-PCR was used to validate their expression patterns using representative miRNAs. Target genes and proteins were identified using psRNATarget program. Predicted targets of the 22 miRNA families belong mostly to classes of genes involved in defense/stress response, metabolism, regulation, and signaling. qRT-PCR was also used to validate the expression patterns of representative target genes. This study shows that conserved miRNAs are expressed in mature and germinated loblolly pine pollen. Many of these miRNAs are differentially expressed, which indicates that the two stages of the male gametophyte examined are regulated at the miRNA level. This study also expands our knowledge of the male gametophytes of seed plants by providing insights on some similarities and differences in the types and expression patterns of conserved miRNAs between loblolly pine with those of rice and Arabidopsis.
24442255	Production of poly-3-(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) by Haloferax mediterranei using rice-based ethanol stillage with simultaneous recovery and re-use of medium salts.	2014	Extremophiles	Haloferax mediterranei holds promise for competitive industrial-scale production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) because cheap carbon sources can be used thus lowering production costs. Although high salt concentration in production medium permits a non-sterile, low-cost process, salt disposal after process completion is a problem as current environmental standards do not allow total dissolved solids (TDS) above 2000 mg/l in discharge water. As the first objective of this work, the waste product of rice-based ethanol industry, stillage, was used for the production of PHA by H. mediterranei in shake flasks. Utilization of raw stillage led to 71 ± 2% (of dry cell weight) PHA accumulation and 16.42 ± 0.02 g/l PHA production. The product yield coefficient was 0.35 while 0.17 g/l h volumetric productivity was attained. Simultaneous reduction of BOD5 and COD values of stillage by 83% was accomplished. The PHA was isolated by osmotic lysis of cells, purification by sodium dodecyl sulfate and organic solvents. The biopolymer was identified as poly-3-(hydroxybutyrate-co-15.4 mol%-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). This first report on utilization of rice-based ethanol stillage for PHBV production by H. mediterranei is currently the most cost effective. As the second objective, directional properties of decanoic acid together with temperature dependence of water solubility in decanoic acid were applied for two-stage desalination of the spent stillage medium. We report for the first time, recovery and re-use of 96% of the medium salts for PHA production thus removing the major bottleneck in the potential application of H. mediterranei for industrial production of PHBV. Final discharge water had TDS content of 670 mg/l.
24518682	Predicting the function of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (LJ4CL1) in Lonicera japonica.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	4-Coumarate:CoA ligases (4CLs) are a group of essential enzymes involved in the pathway of phenylpropanoid-derived compound metabolisms; however it is still difficult to identify orthologs and paralogs of these important enzymes just based on sequence similarity of the conserved domains. Using sequence data of 20 plant species from the public databases and sequences from Lonicera japonica, we define 1252 adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent synthetase/ligase sequences and classify them into three phylogenetic clades. 4CLs are in one of the four subgroups, according to their partitioning, with known proteins characterized in A. thaliana and Oryza sativa. We also defined 184 non-redundant sequences that encode proteins containing the GEICIRG motif and the taxonomic distribution of these GEICIRG-containing proteins suggests unique catalytic activities in plants. We further analyzed their transcription levels in L. japonica and L. japonica. var. chinensis flowers and chose the highest expressed genes representing the subgroups for structure and binding site predictions. Coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of the L. japonica flowers, the structural study on putative substrate binding amino acid residues, ferulate, and 4-coumaric acid of the conserved binding-site of LJ4CL1 leads to a conclusion that this highly expressed protein group in the flowers may process 4-coumarate that represents 90% of the known phenylpropanoid-derived compounds. The activity of purified crude LJ4CL1 protein was analyzed using 4-coumarate as template and high activity indicating that 4-coumarate is one of the substrates of LJ4CL1.
24243207	Sorghum genetic transformation by particle bombardment.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	Particle bombardment transformation describes the acceleration of high-velocity microparticles coated with exotic genes through the plant-protective cell walls, in order for the introduced genes to be integrated into the host genome. This technique has proven to be an effective and versatile approach towards plant genetic modification in preceding decades. Particle bombardment has been successfully applied to cereals including rice, maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum. Historically, sorghum has been considered as one of the most recalcitrant major crops with regard to successful genetic transformation; however, tremendous progress has been made in recent years. Transformation efficiency by particle bombardment has now improved from approximately 1 % to in excess of 20 % utilizing an optimized tissue culture and DNA delivery system. The protocol described in this chapter routinely generates transformants at 10-25 % efficiency within sorghum genotype Tx430. The process generally takes 11-16 weeks from initiation of immature embryos to planting of transformants. This protocol covers the operation of both the Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He System and particle inflow gun. Three factors are crucial to an efficient particle bombardment transformation system: (1) an efficient tissue culture system, (2) a highly efficient DNA delivery system, and (3) an effective selection strategy.
24548929	Degradation of lignocelluloses in rice straw by BMC-9, a composite microbial system.	2014	J Microbiol Biotechnol	To evaluate the potential utility of pretreatment of raw biomass with a complex microbial system, we investigated the degradation of rice straw by BMC-9, a lignocellulose decomposition strain obtained from a biogas slurry compost environment. The degradation characteristics and corresponding changes in the bacterial community were assessed. The results showed that rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, with a peak total biomass bacterium concentration of 3.3 × 10(8) copies/ml on day 1. The pH of the fermentation broth declined initially and then increased, and the mass of rice straw decreased steadily. The highest concentrations of volatile fatty acid contents (0.291 mg/l lactic acid, 0.31 mg/l formic acid, 1.93 mg/l acetic acid, and 0.73 mg/l propionic acid) as well as the highest xylanse activity (1.79 U/ml) and carboxymethyl cellulase activity (0.37 U/ml) occurred on day 9. The greatest diversity among the microbial community also occurred on day 9, with the presence of bacteria belonging to Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., and Geobacillus sp. Together, our results indicate that BMC-9 has a strong ability to rapidly degrade the lignocelluloses of rice straw under relatively inexpensive conditions, and the optimum fermentation time is 9 days.
24445591	The modified rice αAmy8 promoter confers high-level foreign gene expression in a novel hypoxia-inducible expression system in transgenic rice seedlings.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Expression of α-amylase genes in rice is induced not only by sugar starvation and gibberellin (GA) but also by O2 deficiency. Promoters of two rice α-amylase genes, αAmy3 and αAmy8, have been shown to direct high-level production of recombinant proteins in rice suspension cells and germinated seeds. In the present study, we modified the cis-acting DNA elements within the sugar/GA response complex (SRC/GARC) of αAmy8 promoter. We found that addition of a G box and duplicated TA box leads to high-level expression of αAmy8 SRC/GARC and significantly enhances αAmy8 promoter activity in transformed rice cells and germinated transgenic rice seeds. We also show that these modifications have drastically increased the activity of αAmy8 promoter in rice seedlings under hypoxia. Our results reveal that the G box and duplicated TA box may play important roles in stimulating promoter activity in response to hypoxia in rice. The modified αAmy8 promoter was used to produce the recombinant human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) in rice cells and hypoxic seedlings. We found that the bioactive recombinant hEGF are stably produced and yields are up to 1.8% of total soluble protein (TSP) in transformed rice cells. The expression level of synthetic hEGF containing preferred rice codon usage comprises up to 7.8% of TSP in hypoxic transgenic seedlings. Our studies reveal that the modified αAmy8 promoter can be applicable in establishing a novel expression system for the high-level production of foreign proteins in transgenic rice cells and seedlings under hypoxia.
24568490	Purple rice extract supplemented diet reduces DMH- induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon by inhibition of bacterial β-glucuronidase.	2014	Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	BACKGROUND: Purple rice has become a natural product of interest which is widely used for health promotion. This study investigated the preventive effect of purple rice extract (PRE) mixed diet on DMH initiation of colon carcinogenesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were fed with PRE mixed diet one week before injection of DMH (40 mg/kg of body weight once a week for 2 weeks). They were killed 12 hrs after a second DMH injection to measure the level of O6-methylguanine and xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme activities.

RESULTS: In rats that received PRE, guanine methylation was reduced in the colonic mucosa, but not in the liver, whereas PRE did not affect xenobiotic conjugation, with reference to glutathione-S-transferase or UDP-glucuronyl transferase. After 5 weeks, rats that received PRE with DMH injection had fewer ACF in the colon than those treated with DMH alone. Interestingly, a PRE mixed diet inhibited the activity of bacterial β-glucuronidase in rat feces, a critical enzyme for free methylazoxymethanol (MAM) release in the rat colon. These results indicated that purple rice extract inhibited β-glucuronidase activity in the colonic lumen, causing a reduction of MAM-induced colonic mucosa DNA methylation, leaded to decelerated formation of aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.

CONCLUSIONS: The supplemented purple rice extract might thus prevent colon carcinogenesis by the alteration of the colonic environment, and thus could be further developed for neutraceutical products for colon cancer prevention.
24398116	Development of a microarray for two rice subspecies: characterization and validation of gene expression in rice tissues.	2014	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: Rice is one of the major crop species in the world helping to sustain approximately half of the global population's diet especially in Asia. However, due to the impact of extreme climate change and global warming, rice crop production and yields may be adversely affected resulting in a world food crisis. Researchers have been keen to understand the effects of drought, temperature and other environmental stress factors on rice plant growth and development. Gene expression microarray technology represents a key strategy for the identification of genes and their associated expression patterns in response to stress. Here, we report on the development of the rice OneArray® microarray platform which is suitable for two major rice subspecies, japonica and indica.

RESULTS: The rice OneArray® 60-mer, oligonucleotide microarray consists of a total of 21,179 probes covering 20,806 genes of japonica and 13,683 genes of indica. Through a validation study, total RNA isolated from rice shoots and roots were used for comparison of gene expression profiles via microarray examination. The results were submitted to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Data can be found under the GEO accession number GSE50844 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50844). A list of significantly differentially expressed genes was generated; 438 shoot-specific genes were identified among 3,138 up-regulated genes, and 463 root-specific genes were found among 3,845 down-regulated genes. GO enrichment analysis demonstrates these results are in agreement with the known physiological processes of the different organs/tissues. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validation was performed on 66 genes, and found to significantly correlate with the microarray results (R = 0.95, p < 0.001***).

CONCLUSION: The rice OneArray® 22 K microarray, the first rice microarray, covering both japonica and indica subspecies was designed and validated in a comprehensive study of gene expression in rice tissues. The rice OneArray® microarray platform revealed high specificity and sensitivity. Additional information for the rice OneArray® microarray can be found at http://www.phalanx.com.tw/index.php.
24472286	Small auxin upregulated RNA (SAUR) gene family in maize: identification, evolution, and its phylogenetic comparison with Arabidopsis, rice, and sorghum.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Small auxin-up RNAs (SAURs) are the early auxin-responsive genes represented by a large multigene family in plants. Here, we identified 79 SAUR gene family members from maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) by a reiterative database search and manual annotation. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the SAUR proteins from Arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, and maize had divided into 16 groups. These genes were non-randomly distributed across the maize chromosomes, and segmental duplication and tandem duplication contributed to the expansion of the maize SAUR gene family. Synteny analysis established orthology relationships and functional linkages between SAUR genes in maize and sorghum genomes. We also found that the auxin-responsive elements were conserved in the upstream sequences of maize SAUR members. Selection analyses identified some significant site-specific constraints acted on most SAUR paralogs. Expression profiles based on microarray data have provided insights into the possible functional divergence among members of the SAUR gene family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that some of the 10 randomly selected ZmSAUR genes could be induced at least in maize shoot or root tissue tested. The results reveal a comprehensive overview of the maize SAUR gene family and may pave the way for deciphering their function during plant development.
24688294	TaWRKY68 responses to biotic stresses are revealed by the orthologous genes from major cereals.	2014	Genet Mol Biol	WRKY transcription factors have been extensively characterized in the past 20 years, but in wheat, studies on WRKY genes and their function are lagging behind many other species. To explore the function of wheat WRKY genes, we identified a TaWRKY68 gene from a common wheat cultivar. It encodes a protein comprising 313 amino acids which harbors 19 conserved motifs or active sites. Gene expression patterns were determined by analyzing microarray data of TaWRKY68 in wheat and of orthologous genes from maize, rice and barley using Genevestigator. TaWRKY68 orthologs were identified and clustered using DELTA-BLAST and COBALT programs available at NCBI. The results showed that these genes, which are expressed in all tissues tested, had relatively higher levels in the roots and were up-regulated in response to biotic stresses. Bioinformatics results were confirmed by RT-PCR experiments using wheat plants infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Blumeria graminis, or treated with Deoxynivalenol, a Fusarium graminearum-induced mycotoxin in wheat or barley. In summary, TaWRKY68 functions differ during plant developmental stages and might be representing a hub gene function in wheat responses to various biotic stresses. It was also found that including data from major cereal genes in the bioinformatics analysis gave more accurate and comprehensive predictions of wheat gene functions.
24556552	An efficient TALEN mutagenesis system in rice.	2014	Methods	Targeted gene mutagenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating gene function and facilitating genetic improvement in rice. TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases), consisting of a custom TALE DNA binding domain fused to a nonspecific FokI cleavage domain, are one of the most efficient genome engineering methods developed to date. The technology of TALENs allows DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to be introduced into predetermined chromosomal loci. DSBs trigger DNA repair mechanisms and can result in loss of gene function by error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or they can be exploited to modify gene function or activity by precise homologous recombination (HR). In this paper, we describe a detailed protocol for constructing TALEN expression vectors, assessing nuclease activities in vivo using rice protoplast-based assays, generating and introducing TALEN DNAs into embryogenic calluses of rice and identifying TALEN-generated mutations at targeted genomic sites. Using these methods, T0 rice plants resulting from TALEN mutagenesis can be produced within 4-5 months.
24405808	Beyond cleaved small RNA targets: unraveling the complexity of plant RNA degradome data.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Degradation is essential for RNA maturation, turnover, and quality control. RNA degradome sequencing that integrates a modified 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol with next-generation sequencing technologies is a high-throughput approach for profiling the 5'-end of uncapped RNA fragments on a genome-wide scale. The primary application of degradome sequencing has been to identify the truncated transcripts that result from endonucleolytic cleavage guided by microRNAs or small interfering RNAs. As many pathways are involved in RNA degradation, degradome data should contain other RNA species besides the cleavage remnants of small RNA targets. Nevertheless, no systematic approaches have been established to explore the hidden complexity of plant degradome.

RESULTS: Through analyzing Arabidopsis and rice RNA degradome data, we recovered 11 short motifs adjacent to predominant and abundant uncapped 5'-ends. Uncapped ends associated with several of these short motifs were more prevalent than those targeted by most miRNA families especially in the 3' untranslated region of transcripts. Through genome-wide analysis, five motifs showed preferential accumulation of uncapped 5'-ends at the same position in Arabidopsis and rice. Moreover, the association of uncapped 5'-ends with a CA-repeat motif and a motif recognized by Pumilio/Fem-3 mRNA binding factor (PUF) proteins was also found in non-plant species, suggesting that common mechanisms are present across species. Based on these motifs, potential sources of RNA ends that constitute degradome data were proposed and further examined. The 5'-end of small nucleolar RNAs could be precisely captured by degradome sequencing. Position-specific enrichment of uncapped 5'-ends was seen upstream of motifs recognized by several RNA binding proteins especially for the binding site of PUF proteins. False uncapped 5'-ends produced from capped transcripts through non-specific PCR amplification were common artifacts among degradome datasets.

CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of plant RNA degradome data revealed in this study may contribute to the alternative applications of degradome in RNA research.
24675748	Identification of 17 HrpX-regulated proteins including two novel type III effectors, XOC_3956 and XOC_1550, in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2014	PLoS One	The function of some hypothetical proteins, possibly regulated by key hrp regulators, in the pathogenicity of phytopathogenic bacteria remains largely unknown. In the present study, in silicon microarray data demonstrated that the expression of 17 HrpX-regulated protein (Xrp) genes of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial leaf streak in rice, were either positively or negatively regulated by HrpX or/and HrpG. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that five Xrps possess a putative type III secretion (T3S) signal in the first 50 N-terminal amino acids, six xrp genes contain a PIP-box-like sequence (TTCGB-NX-TTCGB, 9 ≤ X ≤ 25) in the promoter regions, and two Xrps have both motifs. Twelve Xrps are widely conserved in Xanthomonas spp., whereas four are specific for X. oryzae (Xrp6) or Xoc (Xrp8, Xrp14 and Xrp17). In addition to the regulation by HrpG/HrpX, some of the 17 genes were also modulated by another hrp regulator HrpD6. Mutagenesis of these 17 genes indicated that five Xrps (Xrp1, Xrp2, Xrp5, Xrp8 and Xrp14) were required for full virulence and bacterial growth in planta. Immunoblotting assays and fusion with N-terminally truncated AvrXa10 indicated that Xrp3 and Xrp5 were secreted and translocated into rice cells through the type-III secretion system (T3S), suggesting they are novel T3S effectors. Our results suggest that Xoc exploits an orchestra of proteins that are regulated by HrpG, HrpX and HrpD6, and these proteins facilitate both infection and metabolism.
24588175	Hydrogen migration dynamics in hydrated Al clusters: the Al17(-)·H2O system as an example.	2014	J Chem Phys	The Alm((-))·(H2O)n systems are known to undergo water splitting processes in the gas phase giving HkAlm(OH)k((-))·(H2O)n-k systems, which can generate H2. The migration of H atoms from one Al atom to another on the cluster's surface is of critical importance to the mechanism of the complete H2 production process. We have applied a combination of Molecular Dynamics and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory including tunneling effects to study the gas-phase evolution of HAl17(OH)((-)), which can be considered a model system. First, we have performed an extensive search for local minima and the connecting saddle points using a density functional theory method. It is found that in the water-splitting process Al17((-))·(H2O) → HAl17(OH)((-)), the H atom which bonds to the Al cluster losses rather quickly its excess energy, which is easily "absorbed" by the cluster because of its flexibility. This fact ultimately determines that long-range hydrogen migration is not a very fast process and that, probably, tunneling only plays a secondary role in the migration dynamics, at least for moderate energies. Reduction of the total energy results in the process being very much slowed down. The consequences on the possible mechanisms of H2 generation from the interaction of Al clusters and water molecules are discussed.
24456316	BE EMPOWERED, a specialty pharmacy education program for hemophilia B patients, impacts adult joint bleeds and pediatric use of RICE.	2014	J Manag Care Pharm	BACKGROUND: Traditional education about hemophilia B in hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) and episodic contact with HTCs limit the amount of education patients and their caregivers receive. Specialty care providers have frequent, continuing contact with patients. Each contact with a specialty care provider (e.g., coordinating a refill or addressing a patient inquiry) is another opportunity to support patient self-management of the disease and to give counsel on appropriate medication administration. The role of specialty pharmacy in improving patient self-management and supporting medication management and adherence is well established and reported with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and renal transplant. With hemophilia, specialty pharmacies can support educational reinforcement of HTCs as well as support patient self-management and education of medication therapy. Utilization of patient education materials and programs can facilitate such a role. BE EMPOWERED, a specialty pharmacy education program for hemophilia B patients, is a multimodule education program coupled with frequent telephonic outreach.

OBJECTIVE: To provide education about hemophilia B, based upon discrete curriculum modules, facilitated by a specialty pharmacy-based nurse educator.

METHODS: Patients with hemophilia B (or, for children, their caregivers) were enrolled in the BE EMPOWERED program, and data were prospectively collected regarding bleeding and hemophilia-specific quality of life (QoL) outcomes (n = 21 caregivers, n = 17 adults).

RESULTS: BE EMPOWERED was associated with a statistically significant impact on the use of RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) by caregivers whose utilization increased from 81% to 95% (P = 0.05). Adults in the BE EMPOWERED program experienced a statistically significant drop in the annualized bleeding rate (ABR), decreasing from 4.7 to 2.5 for total bleeds and decreasing from 3.5 to 1.7 for joint bleeds (P ≤ 0.02). For children with hemophilia B, bleeds were less common overall, as reported by their caregivers, with a mean ABR of 1.1 before and 1.2 following the program. Regarding QoL scores, adults had lower scores compared with children enrolled in the program.

CONCLUSIONS: Completion of the BE EMPOWERED program was associated with a decrease in total bleeds and in joint bleeds in adults and with increased RICE utilization in children, as reported by caregivers. QoL scores were lower in adults compared with children, and further research is warranted to understand this difference. Future studies may focus on the effect of specialty pharmacy as an educational vehicle with potential cost benefits.
24433960	Apparent digestibility of broken rice in horses using in vivo and in vitro methods.	2014	Animal	The aim of this study was to assess the apparent digestibility of broken rice using total collection of feces and the pepsin-cellulase in vitro technique to provide updated and more accurate digestion coefficients for this by-product when fed to horses. The in vivo digestibility trial was consecutively performed, using five adult geldings, weighing 555.6 kg on average. First, hay was given as the only feedstuff, while second, the experimental diet consisted of the same hay plus broken rice at a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 70/30 (on dry matter (DM) basis). Feces were collected over 6 days preceded by a 14-day adaptation period. The digestibility trial was carried out to determine the digestion coefficients for DM, organic matter (OM), CP and gross energy in both diets, while apparent digestion coefficients for the same parameters were calculated for broken rice alone, using the difference between the two sets of results. At the same time, an in vitro trial was carried out using pepsin-cellulase technique on the samples of hay and broken rice tested during the in vivo trial. As expected, supplementation with broken rice increased digestibility according to all the parameters used. The high OM digestion coefficients of broken rice were confirmed both by the calculated in vivo method and by the predicted results of pepsin-cellulase technique (92.6% and 87.1%, respectively), underlining the high digestibility of this by-product when fed to horses.
24637831	Transcriptomic analysis of the rice white tip nematode, Aphelenchoides besseyi (Nematoda: Aphelenchoididae).	2014	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The rice white tip nematode Aphelenchoides besseyi, a devastating nematode whose genome has not been sequenced, is distributed widely throughout almost all the rice-growing regions of the world. The aims of the present study were to define the transcriptome of A. besseyi and to identify parasite-related, mortality-related or host resistance-overcoming genes in this nematode.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using Solexa/Illumina sequencing, we profiled the transcriptome of mixed-stage populations of A. besseyi. A total of 51,270 transcripts without gaps were produced based on high-quality clean reads. Of all the A. besseyi transcripts, 9,132 KEGG Orthology assignments were annotated. Carbohydrate-active enzymes of glycoside hydrolases (GHs), glycosyltransferases (GTs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) were identified. The presence of the A. besseyi GH45 cellulase gene was verified by in situ hybridization. Given that 13 unique A. besseyi potential effector genes were identified from 41 candidate effector homologs, further studies of these homologs are merited. Finally, comparative analyses were conducted between A. besseyi contigs and Caenorhabditis elegans genes to look for orthologs of RNAi phenotypes, neuropeptides and peptidases.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The present results provide comprehensive insight into the genetic makeup of A. besseyi. Many of this species' genes are parasite related, nematode mortality-related or necessary to overcome host resistance. The generated transcriptome dataset of A. besseyi reported here lays the foundation for further studies of the molecular mechanisms related to parasitism and facilitates the development of new control strategies for this species.
24586171	Code-assisted discovery of TAL effector targets in bacterial leaf streak of rice reveals contrast with bacterial blight and a novel susceptibility gene.	2014	PLoS Pathog	Bacterial leaf streak of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an increasingly important yield constraint in this staple crop. A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting.
24499797	Hpa1 harpin needs nitroxyl terminus to promote vegetative growth and leaf photosynthesis in Arabidopsis.	2014	J Biosci	Hpa1 is a harpin protein produced by Xanthomonas oryzae, an important bacterial pathogen of rice, and has the growth-promoting activity in plants. To understand the molecular basis for the function of Hpa1, we generated an inactive variant protein, Hpa1 delta NT, by deleting the nitroxyl-terminal region of the Hpa1 sequence and compared Hpa1 delta NT with the full-length protein in terms of the effects on vegetative growth and related physiological responses in Arabidopsis. When Hpa1 was applied to plants, it acted to enhance the vegetative growth but did not affect the floral development. Enhanced plant growth was accompanied by induced expression of growth-promoting genes in plant leaves. The growth-promoting activity of Hpa1 was further correlated with a physiological consequence shown as promoted leaf photosynthesis as a result of facilitated CO2 conduction through leaf stomata and mesophyll cells. On the contrary, plant growth, growth-promoting gene expression, and the physiological consequence changed little in response to the Hpa1 delta NT treatment. These analyses suggest that Hpa1 requires the nitroxyl-terminus to facilitate CO2 transport inside leaf cells and promote leaf photosynthesis and vegetative growth of the plant.
24484685	Brazil's staple food and incident diabetes.	2014	Nutrition	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of Brazil's staple food, rice, beans and manioc, and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) in adults assisted by a Brazilian Family Doctor Program (FDP).

METHODS: The baseline information was collected on visits to 13 units of the FDP from July 2006 to December 2007 (CAMELIA Study). The units were revisited by trained researchers between July and December 2011, who reviewed medical records of all participants of the baseline. Biochemical, anthropometrical and blood pressure measurements, new diagnoses, and medical prescriptions were collected. Individuals ages ≥20 y, who were non-diabetic at baseline were included (N = 409). Food consumption was estimated using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Incident of diabetes was classified according to fasting serum glucose (≥126 mg/dL), individual's use of antidiabetic drugs, and/or diagnosis of diabetes described in the medical record. Individuals who were negative at baseline and also were negative for the above conditions were classified as non-diabetics.

RESULTS: Individuals who developed T2DM (N = 30) reported higher consumption of red meat and beans and less consumption of cassava flour, independent of the interval between visits and other potential confounding variables. The cassava flour showed a protective effect (relative risk, 0.910; 95% confidence interval, 0.842-0.982).

CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of cassava flour, a low-cost product, could be considered in diets for the prevention and control of diabetes. The hypothesis must be investigated in cohorts from different populations and tested in randomized controlled trials.
24643171	Effects of pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical properties of empty fruit bunch and rice husk biochars.	2014	Waste Manag Res	Biochar has received great attention recently due to its potential to improve soil fertility and immobilize contaminants as well as serving as a way of carbon sequestration and therefore a possible carbon sink. In this work, a series of biochars were produced from empty fruit bunch (EFB) and rice husk (RH) by slow pyrolysis at different temperatures (350, 500, and 650°C) and their physicochemical properties were analysed. The results indicate that porosity, ash content, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH value of both EFB and RH biochars were increased with temperature; however, yield, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and H, C, and N content were decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The Fourier transform IR spectra were similar for both RH and EFB biochars but the functional groups were more distinct in the EFB biochar spectra. There were reductions in the amount of functional groups as pyrolysis temperature increased especially for the EFB biochar. However, total acidity of the functional groups increased with pyrolysis temperature for both biochars.
24658143	Influence of environmental factors on the germination of Urena lobata L. and its response to herbicides.	2014	PLoS One	Urena lobata is becoming a noxious and invasive weed in rangelands, pastures, and undisturbed areas in the Philippines. This study determined the effects of seed scarification, light, salt and water stress, amount of rice residue, and seed burial depth on seed germination and emergence of U. lobata; and evaluated the weed's response to post-emergence herbicides. Germination was stimulated by both mechanical and chemical seed scarifications. The combination of the two scarification methods provided maximum (99%) seed germination. Germination was slightly stimulated when seeds were placed in light (65%) compared with when seeds were kept in the dark (46%). Sodium chloride concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mM and osmotic potential ranging from 0 to -1.6 MPa affected the germination of U. lobata seeds significantly. The osmotic potential required for 50% inhibition of the maximum germination was -0.1 MPa; however, some seeds germinated at -0.8 MPa, but none germinated at -1.6 MPa. Seedling emergence and biomass increased with increase in rice residue amount up to 4 t ha(-1), but declined beyond this amount. Soil surface placement of weed seeds resulted in the highest seedling emergence (84%), which declined with increase in burial depth. The burial depth required for 50% inhibition of maximum emergence was 2 cm; emergence was greatly reduced (93%) at burial depth of 4 cm or more. Weed seedling biomass also decreased with increase in burial depth. Bispyribac-sodium, a commonly used herbicide in rice, sprayed at the 4-leaf stage of the weed, provided 100% control, which did not differ much with 2,4-D (98%), glyphosate (97%), and thiobencarb + 2,4-D (98%). These herbicides reduced shoot and root biomass by 99-100%.
24632627	Identification of novel bacterial expansins and their synergistic actions on cellulose degradation.	2014	Bioresour Technol	Novel expansins, non-catalytic proteins which induce weakening of the rigid cellulose structure, have been identified in this study. A pipeline of bioinformatics was implemented for sequence and structure-based prediction of putative bacterial expansin-like group × family from NR databases. All putative expansins had no detectable activity against cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates but showed varying degrees of synergy (2.0-7.6 folds) with the commercial Trichoderma reesei cellulase (Celluclast™ 1.5L) on degradation of filter paper in order of BpEX ≈ CmEX > MaEX > PcEX > SaEX. A mixture design with full cubic model predicted optimal formulation comprising Celluclast™: CmEX from Clavibacter michiganensis = 72.4%: 27.6%, with no synergy of β-glucosidase on degradation of alkaline pretreated rice straw. Under these conditions, the reducing sugar yield was 163.6% compared with the reaction containing cellulase alone. This work demonstrated the potential benefit of novel bacterial expansins on enhancing cellulose degradation efficiency in lignocellulosic biomass degradation.
24420841	Stereoselective determination of a novel chiral insecticide, sulfoxaflor, in brown rice, cucumber and apple by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.	2014	Chirality	An effective high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for the stereoselective determination of a new sulfoximines insecticide, sulfoxaflor, in brown rice, cucumber and apple. Target compounds were extracted with acetonitrile and an aliquot cleaned with Cleanert PestiCarb/PSA (primary and secondary amine) cartridge. Five polysaccharide-based columns were investigated on the separation of sulfoxaflor stereoisomers and the best was achieved on a ChromegaChiral CCA column with n-hexane/ethanol/methanol (90:2:8, v/v/v) as mobile phase by UV detection at 220 nm at 20ºC. The resolutions of the four stereoisomers were 1.85, 1.54 and 3.08, and the elution order was identified by optical rotation and stereoisomers ratio. The mean recoveries of sulfoxaflor stereoisomers ranged from 77.1% to 99.3%, with relative standard deviations less than 8.9% at three concentration levels in all matrices. The limits of detection for all stereoisomers varied from 0.05 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg, while the limit of quantification did not exceed 0.22 mg/kg. The method was then successfully applied to determine the sulfoxaflor stereoisomers in authentic samples, confirming that it is convenient and reliable for stereoselective determination of sulfoxaflor stereoisomers in food.
24389666	Characterization of the fusaric acid gene cluster in Fusarium fujikuroi.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The "bakanae" fungus Fusarium fujikuroi is a common pathogen of rice and produces a variety of mycotoxins, pigments, and phytohormones. Fusaric acid is one of the oldest known secondary metabolites produced by F. fujikuroi and some other Fusarium species. Investigation of its biosynthesis and regulation is of great interest due to its occurrence in cereal-based food and feed. This study describes the identification and characterization of the fusaric acid gene cluster in F. fujikuroi consisting of the PKS-encoding core gene and four co-regulated genes, FUB1-FUB5. Besides fusaric acid, F. fujikuroi produces two fusaric acid-like derivatives: fusarinolic acid and 9,10-dehydrofusaric acid. We provide evidence that these derivatives are not intermediates of the fusaric acid biosynthetic pathway, and that their formation is catalyzed by genes outside of the fusaric acid gene cluster. Target gene deletions of all five cluster genes revealed that not all of them are involved in fusaric acid biosynthesis. We suggest that only two genes, FUB1 and FUB4, are necessary for the biosynthesis. Expression of the FUB genes and production of fusaric acid and the two derivatives are favored under high nitrogen. We show that nitrogen-dependent expression of fusaric acid genes is positively regulated by the nitrogen-responsive GATA transcription factor AreB, and that pH-dependent regulation is mediated by the transcription factor PacC. In addition, fusaric acid production is regulated by two members of the fungal-specific velvet complex: Vel1 and Lae1. In planta expression studies show a higher expression in the favorite host plant rice compared to maize.
24680698	TALEN utilization in rice genome modifications.	2014	Methods	Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), the newly developed and powerful genetic tools for precise genome editing, are fusion proteins of TAL effectors as DNA binding domains and the cleavage domain of FokI endonuclease. As a pair, the central repeat regions of TALENs determine the DNA binding specificity for the two sub-target sites; and the dimeric non-specific FokI cleavage domains cause a DNA double strand break (DSB) between the bound sequences. In vivo, cells repair the DSBs through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway or homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Various methods have been developed for easy and fast assembly of TALEN genes for their utilization in a variety of eukaryotic cells or organisms. Here we present a TALEN-based rice genome modification protocol including constructing modularly assembled TALENs, rice transformation, and mutant screening.
24521457	The last half-repeat of transcription activator-like effector (TALE) is dispensable and thereby TALE-based technology can be simplified.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	To activate the expression of host genes that contribute to pathogen growth, pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria inject their transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into plant cells and the TALEs bind to target gene promoters by the central repeat region consisting of near-perfect 34-amino-acid repeats (34-aa repeats). Based on the recognition codes between the 34-aa repeats and the targeted nucleotides, TALE-based technologies, such as designer TALEs (dTALEs) and TALE nucleases (TALENs), have been developed. Amazingly, every natural TALE invariantly has a truncated last half-repeat (LHR) at the end of the 34-aa repeats. Consequently, all the reported dTALEs and TALENs also harbour their LHRs. Here, we show that the LHRs in dTALEs are dispensable for the function of gene activation by both transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and gene-specific targeting in the rice genome, indicating that TALEs might originate from a single progenitor. In the light of this finding, we demonstrate that dTALEs can be constructed through two simple steps. Moreover, the activation strengths of dTALEs lacking the LHR are comparable with those of dTALEs harbouring the LHR. Our results provide new insights into the origin of natural TALEs, and will facilitate the simplification of the design and assembly of TALE-based tools, such as dTALEs and TALENs, in the near future.
24370634	Nitrogen metabolism in plants under low oxygen stress.	2014	Planta	More frequent flooding and waterlogging events due to more heavy precipitation are expected worldwide in the context of climate change. Accordingly, adaptation of plants to oxygen limitation at both cellular and whole plant levels should be investigated thoroughly, that derived knowledge could be taken into account in breeding programs and agronomical practices for saving plant fitness, growth and development even when oxygen availability is low. In the present review, we highlight current knowledge on essential aspects of low oxygen stress-induced changes in nitrogen metabolism. The involvement of two possible pathways for NO production either via the reaction catalyzed by nitrate reductase or at Complex III or IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus contributing to ATP synthesis via the so-called nitrite-NO respiration, is discussed. NO is proposed to be scavenged by non-symbiotic hemoglobin (Hb) in a Hb/NO cycle, in which NAD(P)H is oxidized for the conversion of NO into NO3(-). The investigation of an additional adaptation to the decrease in oxygen availability via transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of amino acid synthesis pathways, using publicly available transcriptome and translatome data for Arabidopsis thaliana and rice is also discussed.
24358146	Comparative transcriptome analysis of two rice varieties in response to rice stripe virus and small brown planthoppers during early interaction.	2013	PLoS One	Rice stripe, a virus disease, transmitted by a small brown planthopper (SBPH), has greatly reduced production of japonica rice in East Asia, especially in China. Although we have made great progress in mapping resistance genes, little is known about the mechanism of resistance. By de novo transcriptome assembling, we gained sufficient transcript data to analyze changes in gene expression of early interaction in response to SBPH and RSV infection in rice. Respectively 648 and 937 DEGs were detected from the disease-resistant (Liaonong 979) and the susceptible (Fengjin) varieties, most of which were up-regulated. We found 37 genes related to insect resistance, which mainly included genes for jasmonate-induced protein, TIFY protein, lipoxygenase, as well as trypsin inhibitor genes and transcription factor genes. In the interaction process between RSV and rice, 87 genes were thought to be related to RSV resistance; these primarily included 12 peroxidase biosynthesis genes, 12 LRR receptor-like protein kinase genes, 6 genes coding pathogenesis-related proteins, 4 glycine-rich cell wall structural protein genes, 2 xyloglucan hydrolase genes and a cellulose synthase. The results indicate that the rice-pathogen interaction happened both in disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, and some genes related to JA biosynthesis played key roles in the interaction between SBPHs and rice. When rice was infected by RSV a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in the disease-resistant variety was suppressed, which resulted from an increase in peroxidase expression and down-regulation of LRR receptor-like protein kinase and pathogenesis-related proteins, while, the changes of peroxidase biosynthesis, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, cellulose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase could lead to the strengthening of physical barriers of rice, which may be an important resistance mechanism to RSV in rice.
24302292	Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice.	2013	Sci China Life Sci	The class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip III) gene family plays important roles in plant growth and development, including regulation of apical embryo patterning, embryonic shoot meristem formation, leaf polarity, vascular development, and meristem function, with a particularly crucial function in leaf development. Although HD-Zip III members are highly conserved in land plants, previous studies, such as genetic analyses based on multiple mutants in Arabidopsis and other plants, suggest that various HD-Zip III family genes have evolved with distinct functions and pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. In this study, we analyzed a HD-Zip III member, OsHox33, and demonstrated that it plays an important role in age-dependent leaf senescence in rice. We constructed two specific RNAi vectors derived from the 5'-end region and 3'-UTR of OsHox33 to knockdown its expression. Transgenic plants harboring either RNAi construct displayed similar phenotypes of precocious leaf senescence symptoms, suggesting that knockdown of OsHox33 accelerates leaf senescence in rice. pOsHox33::GUS fusion expression and RT-PCR revealed that OsHox33 is highly expressed in young organs, especially in young meristems such as shoot apical meristems, intercalary meristems, and young callus. In addition, real-time PCR indicated that OsHox33 was more highly expressed in young leaves than in old leaves. To further investigate OsHox33 function, we analyzed chloroplast ultrastructure in different-aged leaves of RNAi plants, and found that OsHox33 knockdown accelerated chloroplast degradation, which is consistent with RNAi phenotypes. Finally, real-time PCR studies showed that OsHox33 can regulate the expression of GS1 and GS2, two senescence-associated genes. Taken together, the work presented here provides new insights into the function of HD-Zip III members in plants.
24321450	Agronomic and genetic analysis of Suweon 542, a rice floury mutant line suitable for dry milling.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Producing rice flour of good quality by dry milling is necessary to reduce milling costs and promote the processed rice food industry. This study was conducted to evaluate the dry milling properties of Suweon 542, a floury endosperm mutant, and identify the chromosomal region responsible for the floury endosperm characteristics.

RESULTS: Compared with the wild type, after dry milling process, the grain hardness of Suweon 542 was significantly lower because of its round and loosely packed starch granules. Also, the flour of Suweon 542 had significantly smaller particles and less damaged starch than Namil and other rice cultivars and its particle size distribution was similar to a commercial wheat cultivar. Considering that the yield loss of Suweon 542 due to its floury endosperm was largely compensated for by an increased number of spikelets per panicle, Suweon 542 has potential value as a raw material for rice flour production. Association analysis using 70 genome-wide SSR markers and 94 F2 plants derived from Suweon 542/Milyang 23 showed that markers on chromosome 5 explained a large portion of the variation in floury grains percentage (FGP). Further analysis with an increased number of SSR markers revealed that the floury endosperm of Suweon 542 was directed by a major recessive locus, flo7(t), located in the 19.33-19.86 Mbp region of chromosome 5, with RM18639 explaining 92.2% of FGP variation in the F2 population.

CONCLUSIONS: The floury endosperm of Suweon 542 is suitable for dry milling, with a small flour particle size and low damaged starch content. Further physical mapping of flo7(t), the floury endosperm locus of Suweon 542, would facilitate efficient breeding of rice cultivars with proper dry milling adaptability that can be used in the processed rice food industry.
24302673	Global perspective of herbicide-resistant weeds.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	Two hundred and twenty weed species have evolved resistance to one or more herbicides, and there are now 404 unique cases (species × site of action) of herbicide-resistant weeds globally. ALS inhibitor-resistant weeds account for about a third of all cases (133/404) and are particularly troublesome in rice and cereals. Although 71 weed species have been identified with triazine resistance, their importance has dwindled with the shift towards Roundup Ready® crops in the USA and the reduction of triazine usage in Europe. Forty-three grasses have evolved resistance to ACCase inhibitors, with the most serious cases being Avena spp., Lolium spp., Phalaris spp., Setaria spp. and Alopecurus myosuroides, infesting more than 25 million hectares of cereal production globally. Of the 24 weed species with glyphosate resistance, 16 have been found in Roundup Ready® cropping systems. Although Conyza canadensis is the most widespread glyphosate-resistant weed, Amaranthus palmeri and Amaranthus tuberculartus are the two most economically important glyphosate-resistant weeds because of the area they infest and the fact that these species have evolved resistance to numerous other herbicide sites of action, leaving growers with few herbicidal options for their control. The agricultural chemical industry has not brought any new herbicides with novel sites of action to market in over 30 years, making growers reliant on using existing herbicides in new ways. In addition, tougher registration and environmental regulations on herbicides have resulted in a loss of some herbicides, particularly in Europe. The lack of novel herbicide chemistries being brought to market combined with the rapid increase in multiple resistance in weeds threatens crop production worldwide.
24344809	Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10). OsPT9 and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation. In leaves, expression of the two genes was observed in both mesophyll and vasculature. High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing OsPT9 and OsPT10. Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed OsPT9 and OsPT10 were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis. Significantly higher Pi uptake rates in transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants were observed under both high-Pi and low-Pi solution culture conditions. Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that OsPT9 and OsPT10 redundantly function in Pi uptake.
24346765	Study of chemical pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification for producing fermentable sugars from rice straw.	2014	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	This study evaluated a cost-effective approach for the conversion of rice straw into fermentable sugars. The composition of rice straw pretreated with 1 % sulfuric acid or 1 % sodium hydroxide solution was compared to rice straw with no chemical pretreatment. Enzymatic saccharification experiments on non-pretreated rice straw (NPRS), pretreated rice straw (PRS), and pretreated rice straw with acid hydrolysate (PRSAH) were conducted in a series of batch reactors. The results indicated that pretreating the rice straw with dilute acid and base increased the cellulose content from 38 % to over 50 %. During enzymatic saccharification, straight aliphatic cellulose was hydrolyzed before branched hemicellulose, and glucose was the major hydrolysis product. The glucose yield was 0.52 g glucose/g for NPRS and was comparable to the yields of 0.50 g glucose/g for PRS and 0.58 g glucose/g for PRSAH. The hydrolysis of rice straw to produce glucose can be described by a first-order reaction with a rate constant of 0.0550 d(-1) for NPRS, 0.0653 d(-1) for PRSAH, and 0.0654 d(-1) for PRS. Overall, the production of fermentable sugars from ground rice straw will be more cost effective if the straw is not pretreated with chemicals.
24295086	Characterization of a Nagina22 rice mutant for heat tolerance and mapping of yield traits.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Heat is one of the major factors that considerably limit rice production. Nagina 22 (N22) is a deep-rooted, drought and heat tolerant aus rice cultivar. This study reports the characterization of a previously isolated dark green leaf mutant N22-H-dgl219 (NH219) which showed reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in leaf under 40°C heat conditions.The mutant was characterized for several traits in field under ambient (38°C) and heat stress (44°C) conditions by raising temperature artificially from flowering stage till maturity by covering plants with polythene sheets during dry season 2011. Yield traits were mapped in 70 F2 segregants of IR64 × NH219 and 36 F2 segregants of its reciprocal cross.

RESULTS: Leaf proteome analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from N22 and NH219 showed distinct constitutive expression of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor (EC 4.1.1.39) in NH219 under ambient growth condition. Heat stress resulted in reduction of all 11 traits except plant height in both N22 and NH219. The extent of reduction was more in N22 than in NH219. Both pollen viability and spikelet fertility were not reduced significantly in N22 and NH219 but reduced by 20% in IR64.

CONCLUSION: NH219 is more tolerant to heat stress than wild type N22 as its percent yield reduction is lesser than N22. Single marker analysis showed significant association of RM1089 with number of tillers and yield per plant, RM423 with leaf senescence, RM584 with leaf width and RM229 with yield per plant.
24390992	Quantitative detection of the rice false smut pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens by real-time PCR.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Rice false smut (RFS) is an important rice disease that is caused by the pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens. In this study, we developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect U. virens and to estimate the level of disease. The genomic DNAs of U. virens and rice were extracted together from the rice samples. Real-time PCR assays were performed and compared to conventional nested-PCR assays. The real-time PCR assay presented a consistent linearity of the standard curve (R(2) = 0.9999). The detection limit could be as low as 40 fg U. virens DNA with a rice genomic DNA background on using the real-time PCR assay, which showed significantly higher sensitivity than the conventional nested-PCR assay. We conclude that the real-time PCR quantitative assay is a useful tool for detecting U. virens and for early defense and control of RFS.
24324772	The maize glossy13 gene, cloned via BSR-Seq and Seq-walking encodes a putative ABC transporter required for the normal accumulation of epicuticular waxes.	2013	PLoS One	Aerial plant surfaces are covered by epicuticular waxes that among other purposes serve to control water loss. Maize glossy mutants originally identified by their "glossy" phenotypes exhibit alterations in the accumulation of epicuticular waxes. By combining data from a BSR-Seq experiment and the newly developed Seq-Walking technology, GRMZM2G118243 was identified as a strong candidate for being the glossy13 gene. The finding that multiple EMS-induced alleles contain premature stop codons in GRMZM2G118243, and the one knockout allele of gl13, validates the hypothesis that gene GRMZM2G118243 is gl13. Consistent with this, GRMZM2G118243 is an ortholog of AtABCG32 (Arabidopsis thaliana), HvABCG31 (barley) and OsABCG31 (rice), which encode ABCG subfamily transporters involved in the trans-membrane transport of various secondary metabolites. We therefore hypothesize that gl13 is involved in the transport of epicuticular waxes onto the surfaces of seedling leaves.
24355013	Kinetic and isotherm studies of adsorption and biosorption processes in the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solutions: comparative study.	2013	J Environ Health Sci Eng	The phenolic compounds are known by their carcinogenicity and high toxicity as well as creating unpleasant taste and odor in water resources. The present study develops a cost-effective technology for the treatment of water contaminated with phenolic compounds, including Phenol (Ph), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). So, two sorbents, rice bran ash (RBA) and biomass of brown algae, Cystoseiraindica, were used and results were compared with the commercially granular activated carbon (GAC). The phenolic compounds were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under batch equilibrium conditions. The effects of contact time, pH, initial adsorbate concentration, and adsorbent dosages on the removal efficiency were studied. The adsorption data were simulated by isotherm and kinetic models. Results indicated that RBA and GAC had the lowest efficiency for the removal of 2-CP, while the order of removal efficiency for C. indica biomass was as follows: 2-CP > 4-CP > phenol. The efficiency of GAC was higher than those of other adsorbents for all of the phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of RBA was found to be higher than that of C. indica biomass. The optimal initial pH for the removal of phenol, 2-CP and 4-CP was determined to be 5, 7, and 7 for RBA, GAC, and algal biomass, respectively. Kinetic studies suggested that the pseudo-second order best fitted the kinetic data.
24337801	A special member of the rice SRO family, OsSRO1c, mediates responses to multiple abiotic stresses through interaction with various transcription factors.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	SIMILAR TO RCD ONE (SRO) is a plant-specific gene family involved in development and abiotic stress responses. SRO proteins are characterized by containing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic (PARP) and C-terminal RCD1-SRO-TAF4 domains, and can be classified into two groups and five subgroups on the basis of their PARP domain. Expression analysis of rice SRO genes in response to various abiotic stresses showed that OsSRO1c, a rice SRO gene which functions downstream of the stress-responsive transcription factor SNAC1, is the major stress-responsive gene in the rice SRO family. The ossro1c-1 mutant showed resistance not only to chloroplastic oxidative stress, but also to apoplastic oxidative stress. However, the ossro1c-1 mutant and artificial microRNA-OsSRO1c transgenic rice were significantly impaired in cold tolerance. When compared with the well-characterized Arabidopsis SRO protein radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1), OsSRO1c has considerable variation in the protein sequence, and the two genes exhibit different expression profiles under abiotic stresses. Furthermore, ossro1c-1 and rcd1 showed different responses to multiple abiotic stresses. By screening an Arabidopsis transcription factor library, 29 transcription factors interacted with OsSRO1c in yeast, but only two of these transcription factors were reported to interact with RCD1, which may partly explain the different responses of the two mutants under various stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of OsSRO1c in mediating responses to multiple abiotic stresses.
24419631	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of a rice Rac/Rop GTPase, OsRac1.	2014	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	Small GTPases regulate a large variety of key cellular processes. Plant small Rac/Rop GTPases have recently received broad attention as it is becoming clear that these enzymes regulate various plant cellular processes. OsRac1, a rice Rac/Rop protein, is a key regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induces immune responses. Although four structures of plant small GTPases have been reported, all of these were of the inactive form. Here, OsRac1 was purified and co-crystallized with the GTP analogue 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMPPNP). The crystal belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and a complete data set was collected to 1.9 Å resolution.
24336929	Mapping of seed shattering loci provides insights into origin of weedy rice and rice domestication.	None	J Hered	Seed shattering is an important trait that distinguishes crop cultivars from the wild and weedy species. The genetics of seed shattering was investigated in this study to provide insights into rice domestication and the evolution of weedy rice. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, conducted in 2 recombinant inbred populations involving 2 rice cultivars and a weedy rice accession of the southern United States, revealed 3-5 QTLs that controlled seed shattering with 38-45% of the total phenotypic variation. Two QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 10 were consistent in both populations. Both cultivar and weedy rice contributed alleles for increased seed shattering. Genetic backgrounds affected both QTL number and the magnitude of QTL effects. The major QTL qSH4 and a minor QTL qSH3 were validated in near-isogenic lines, with the former conferring a significantly higher degree of seed shattering than the latter. Although the major QTL qSH4 overlapped with the sh4, the presence of the nonshattering single nucleotide polymorphism allele in the weedy rice accession suggested involvement of a linked locus or an alternative molecular genetic mechanism. Overlapping of several QTLs with those from earlier studies indicated that weedy rice may have been derived from the wild species Oryza rufipogon. Natural hybridization of rice cultivars with the highly variable O. rufipogon present in different geographic regions might be responsible for the evolution of a wide range of phenotypic and genotypic variabilities seen in weedy rice populations worldwide.
24391039	Protein levels and colony development of Africanized and European honey bees fed natural and artificial diets.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Pollen substitute diets are a valuable resource for maintaining strong and health honey bee colonies. Specific diets may be useful in one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy milk powder and albumin, and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer's yeast and rice bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18-21 µg/µL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~37-49 µg/µL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100% on diets D1 and D2, respectively, versus 83 and 60% in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two pollen substitute diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen substitutes during dearth periods and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.
24339403	Degradation kinetics of anilofos in soil and residues in rice crop at harvest.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Pesticides used on rice, which is widely grown in India in the rainy season, must be investigated for the persistence and magnitude of their residues in the crop and soil to ensure human and environmental safety. Anilofos is widely used in rice, and its persistence and dissipation behaviour in soil and rice was investigated in field trials under subhumid and subtropical conditions.

RESULTS: The persistence of anilofos in soil, husk, grain and rice straw was evaluated at two application rates (0.4 and 0.8 kg AI ha(-1) ) by RP-HPLC. In soil, residues were detected up to 45 and 75 days after application at 0.4 and 0.8 kg AI ha(-1) respectively. No residue was observed in soil, husk, grain or rice straw at the time of harvest at either application rate. Detector response was linear within the concentration range 0.1-5.0 µg mL(-1) at 2.22% standard deviation. The limit of detection was 0.003 µg mL(-1) , and the limit of quantification of the method for soil, straw, grain and husk was 0.007, 0.01, 0.008 and 0.01 µg g(-1) respectively.

CONCLUSION: The dissipation of herbicide from soil appeared to occur in a single phase and conformed to pseudo-first-order kinetics. The calculated half-life values of anilofos residue in soil were 13 days for the lower rate of application (0.4 kg AI ha(-1) ) and 15.5 days for the higher rate (0.8 kg AI ha(-1) ). Anilofos residues were below the maximum residue level in soil, husk, rice grain and rice straw at harvest.
24389954	Physiological factors affecting transcription of genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in different rice varieties.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Flavonoids play an important role in the grain color and flavor of rice. Since their characterization in maize, the flavonoid biosynthetic genes have been extensively studied in grape, Arabidopsis, and Petunia. However, we are still a long way from understanding the molecular features and mechanisms underlying the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The present study was undertaken to understand the physiological factors affecting the transcription and regulation of these genes. We report that the expression of CHI, CHS, DFR, LAR, and ANS, the 5 flavonoid biosynthetic genes in different rice varieties, differ dramatically with respect to the stage of development, white light, and sugar concentrations. We further demonstrate that white light could induce the transcription of the entire flavonoid biosynthetic gene pathway; however, differences were observed in the degrees of sensitivity and the required illumination time. Our study provides valuable insights into understanding the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.
24359672	Optimizing plant transporter expression in Xenopus oocytes.	2013	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Rapid improvements in DNA synthesis technology are revolutionizing gene cloning and the characterization of their encoded proteins. Xenopus laevis oocytes are a commonly used heterologous system for the expression and functional characterization of membrane proteins. For many plant proteins, particularly transporters, low levels of expression can limit functional activity in these cells making it difficult to characterize the protein. Improvements in synthetic DNA technology now make it quick, easy and relatively cheap to optimize the codon usage of plant cDNAs for Xenopus. We have tested if this optimization process can improve the functional activity of a two-component plant nitrate transporter assayed in oocytes.

RESULTS: We used the generally available software (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/; http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/) to predict a DNA sequence for the plant gene that is better suited for Xenopus laevis. Rice OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.3a DNA optimized sequences were commercially synthesized for Xenopus expression. The template DNA was used to synthesize cRNA using a commercially available kit. Oocytes were injected with cRNA mixture of optimized and original OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.3a. Oocytes injected with cRNA obtained from using the optimized DNA template could accumulate significantly more NO3- than the original genes after 16 h incubation in 0.5 mM Na15NO3. Two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of the oocytes confirmed that the codon optimized template resulted in significantly larger currents when compared with the original rice cDNA.

CONCLUSION: The functional activity of a rice high affinity nitrate transporter in oocytes was improved by DNA codon optimization of the genes. This methodology offers the prospect for improved expression and better subsequent functional characterization of plant proteins in the Xenopus oocyte system.
24304553	Description of durum wheat linkage map and comparative sequence analysis of wheat mapped DArT markers with rice and Brachypodium genomes.	2013	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: The importance of wheat to the world economy, together with progresses in high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing, have accelerated initiatives of genetic research for wheat improvement. The availability of high density linkage maps is crucial to identify genotype-phenotype associations, but also for anchoring BAC contigs to genetic maps, a strategy followed for sequencing the wheat genome.

RESULTS: Here we report a genetic linkage map in a durum wheat segregating population and the study of mapped DArT markers. The linkage map consists of 126 gSSR, 31 EST-SSR and 351 DArT markers distributed in 24 linkage groups for a total length of 1,272 cM. Through bioinformatic approaches we have analysed 327 DArT clones to reveal their redundancy, syntenic and functional aspects. The DNA sequences of 174 DArT markers were assembled into a non-redundant set of 60 marker clusters. This explained the generation of clusters in very small chromosome regions across genomes. Of these DArT markers, 61 showed highly significant (Expectation < E-10) BLAST similarity to gene sequences in public databases of model species such as Brachypodium and rice. Based on sequence alignments, the analysis revealed a mosaic gene conservation, with 54 and 72 genes present in rice and Brachypodium species, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: In the present manuscript we provide a detailed DArT markers characterization and the basis for future efforts in durum wheat map comparing.
24400015	Internal Zn allocation influences Zn deficiency tolerance and grain Zn loading in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Front Plant Sci	One of the important factors that influences Zn deficiency tolerance and grain Zn loading in crops is the within-plant allocation of Zn. Three independent experiments were carried out to understand the internal Zn distribution patterns in rice genotypes grown in Zn-sufficient and Zn-deficient agar nutrient solution (ANS). In one of the experiments, two rice genotypes (IR55179 and KP) contrasting in Zn deficiency tolerance were leaf-labeled with (65)Zn. In the other two experiments, two Zn biofortification breeding lines (IR69428 and SWHOO) were either root- or leaf-labeled with (65)Zn. Rice genotype IR55179 showed significantly higher Zn deficiency tolerance than KP at 21 and 42 days after planting. When KP was Zn-deficient, it failed to translocate (65)Zn from the labeled leaf to newly emerging leaves. Similarly, the root-to-shoot translocation of unlabeled Zn was lower in KP than in IR55179. These results suggest that some Zn-efficient rice genotypes have greater ability to translocate Zn from older to actively growing tissues than genotypes sensitive to Zn deficiency. Among the two Zn biofortication breeding lines that were leaf-labeled with (65)Zn at 10 days before panicle initiation stage, (65)Zn distribution in the grains at maturity was similar between both genotypes in Zn-sufficient conditions. However, under Zn-deficient conditions, SWHOO accumulated significantly higher (65)Zn in grains than IR69428, indicating that SWHOO is a better remobilizer than IR69428. When the roots of these two Zn biofortication breeding lines were exposed to (65)Zn solution at 10 days after flowering, IR69428 showed higher root uptake of (65)Zn than SWHOO in Zn-sufficient conditions, but (65)Zn allocation in the aerial parts of the plant was similar between both genotypes.
24341349	Biomass digestibility is predominantly affected by three factors of wall polymer features distinctive in wheat accessions and rice mutants.	2013	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: Wheat and rice are important food crops with enormous biomass residues for biofuels. However, lignocellulosic recalcitrance becomes a crucial factor on biomass process. Plant cell walls greatly determine biomass recalcitrance, thus it is essential to identify their key factors on lignocellulose saccharification. Despite it has been reported about cell wall factors on biomass digestions, little is known in wheat and rice. In this study, we analyzed nine typical pairs of wheat and rice samples that exhibited distinct cell wall compositions, and identified three major factors of wall polymer features that affected biomass digestibility.

RESULTS: Based on cell wall compositions, ten wheat accessions and three rice mutants were classified into three distinct groups each with three typical pairs. In terms of group I that displayed single wall polymer alternations in wheat, we found that three wall polymer levels (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) each had a negative effect on biomass digestibility at similar rates under pretreatments of NaOH and H2SO4 with three concentrations. However, analysis of six pairs of wheat and rice samples in groups II and III that each exhibited a similar cell wall composition, indicated that three wall polymer levels were not the major factors on biomass saccharification. Furthermore, in-depth detection of the wall polymer features distinctive in rice mutants, demonstrated that biomass digestibility was remarkably affected either negatively by cellulose crystallinity (CrI) of raw biomass materials, or positively by both Ara substitution degree of non-KOH-extractable hemicelluloses (reverse Xyl/Ara) and p-coumaryl alcohol relative proportion of KOH-extractable lignin (H/G). Correlation analysis indicated that Ara substitution degree and H/G ratio negatively affected cellulose crystallinity for high biomass enzymatic digestion. It was also suggested to determine whether Ara and H monomer have an interlinking with cellulose chains in the future.

CONCLUSIONS: Using nine typical pairs of wheat and rice samples having distinct cell wall compositions and wide biomass saccharification, Ara substitution degree and monolignin H proportion have been revealed to be the dominant factors positively determining biomass digestibility upon various chemical pretreatments. The results demonstrated the potential of genetic modification of plant cell walls for high biomass saccharification in bioenergy crops.
24329970	Effect of silica nanoparticles on microbial biomass and silica availability in maize rhizosphere.	None	Biotechnol Appl Biochem	The effect of silica nanoparticles and conventional silica sources on the changes in microbial biomass and silica availability to pure soil and maize rhizosphere was studied. Nanosilica (20-40 nm) was synthesized from rice husk and comprehensively characterized. The efficiency of nanosilica was evaluated in terms of its effects on beneficial microbial population such as phosphate solubilizers, nitrogen fixers, silicate solubilizers, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, and silica content in comparison with other silica sources such as microsilica, sodium silicate, and silicic acid. Nanosilica significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced microbial populations, total biomass content (C = 1508 μg g(-1) and N = 178 μg g(-1) ), and silica content (14.75 mg mL(-1) ). Although microsilica sources enhanced factors associated with soil fertility, their use by maize roots and silicification in soil was found to be less. The results show that nanosilica plays a vital role in influencing soil nutrient content and microbial biota and, hence, may promote the growth of maize crop.
24391861	OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element for plants. Recently, the genes responsible for uptake of Mn in plants were identified in Arabidopsis and rice. However, the mechanism of Mn distribution in plants has not been clarified. In the present study we identified a natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) family gene in rice, OsNRAMP3, involved in Mn distribution. OsNRAMP3 encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein and was specifically expressed in vascular bundles, especially in phloem cells. Yeast complementation assay showed that OsNRAMP3 is a functional Mn-influx transporter. When OsNRAMP3 was absent, rice plants showed high sensitivity to Mn deficiency. Serious necrosis appeared on young leaves and root tips of the OsNRAMP3 knockout line cultivated under low Mn conditions, and high Mn supplies could rescue this phenotype. However, the necrotic young leaves of the knockout line possessed similar levels of Mn to the wild type, suggesting that the necrotic appearance was caused by disturbed distribution of Mn but not a general Mn shortage. Additionally, compared with wild type, leaf Mn content in osnramp3 plants was mostly in older leaves. We conclude that OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundle-localized Mn-influx transporter involved in Mn distribution and contributes to remobilization of Mn from old to young leaves.
24371175	Assessment of genetic diversity in Indian rice germplasm (Oryza sativa L.): use of random versus trait-linked microsatellite markers.	2013	J Genet	Assessment of genetic diversity in a crop germplasm is a vital part of plant breeding. DNA markers such as microsatellite or simple sequence repeat markers have been widely used to estimate the genetic diversity in rice. The present study was carried out to decipher the pattern of genetic diversity in terms of both phenotypic and genotypic variability, and to assess the efficiency of random vis-á-vis QTL linked/gene based simple sequence repeat markers in diversity estimation. A set of 88 rice accessions that included landraces, farmer's varieties and popular Basmati lines were evaluated for agronomic traits and molecular diversity. The random set of SSR markers included 50 diversity panel markers developed under IRRI's Generation Challenge Programme (GCP) and the trait-linked/gene based markers comprised of 50 SSR markers reportedly linked to yield and related components. For agronomic traits, significant variability was observed, ranging between the maximum for grains/panicle and the minimum for panicle length. The molecular diversity based grouping indicated that varieties from a common centre were genetically similar, with few exceptions. The trait-linked markers gave an average genetic dissimilarity of 0.45 as against that of 0.37 by random markers, along with an average polymorphic information constant value of 0.48 and 0.41 respectively. The correlation between the kinship matrix generated by trait-linked markers and the phenotype based distance matrix (0.29) was higher than that of random markers (0.19). This establishes the robustness of trait-linked markers over random markers in estimating genetic diversity of rice germplasm.
24697072	[Effects of different organic manure sources and their combinations with chemical fertilization on soil nematode community structure in a paddy field of East China].	2013	Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao	A comparative study was conducted to investigate the effects of different fertilization modes on the soil nematode community structure in a paddy field with paddy rice and wheat rotation in Jintan County (31 degrees 39'41.8" N, 119 degrees 28'23.5" E) of Jiangsu Province, East China. Six treatments were installed, i. e., no fertilization (CK), 100% chemical NPK fertilization (F), pig manure compost plus 50% chemical fertilization (PF), straw returning plus 100% chemical fertilization (SF), pig manure compost and straw returning plus 50% chemical fertilization (PSF), and application of commercial pig manure-inorganic complex fertilizer (PMF). The soil samples were collected from the field after the paddy rice harvested in autumn. The two continuous years study showed that the soil nematode community structure varied with fertilization treatments and years. The combined application of chemical fertilizers and organic manures increased the total number of soil nematodes, decreased the abundance of soil bacterivorous nematodes, and made the abundance of predator- and omnivore nematodes increased significantly. No significant differences were observed in the abundance of soil fungivorous nematodes among all the treatments. Chemical fertilization alone and the application of commercial pig manure-inorganic complex fertilizer had no obvious suppression effect on the soil phytophagous nematodes. The abundance of soil bacteriavorous nematodes under the combined application of chemical fertilizers and organic manures was relatively increased in the second year, as compared with that in the first year, while the abundance of soil phytophagous nematodes (Hirschmanniella) was relatively decreased in the second year. From the aspect of nematode ecological indices, the Margalef diversity index (H) under the combined application of chemical fertilizers and organic manures in the second year had an increasing trend, while the NCR index had less change. The Wasilewka index had a relative increase in the second year, while the plant-parasitic index had a relative decrease. It was suggested that the application of organic manure could increase the abundance of soil microbivorous nematodes, and made the soil environment tend to be healthy.
24315532	Cis-element of the rice PDIL2-3 promoter is responsible for inducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	A protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family oxidoreductase, PDIL2-3, is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in rice. We identified a critical cis-element required for induction of the ER stress response. The activation of PDIL2-3 in response to ER stress strongly depends on the IRE1-OsbZIP50 signaling pathway.
24351075	Iron biofortification of rice using different transgenic approaches.	2013	Rice (N Y)	More than 2 billion people suffer from iron (Fe) deficiency, and developing crop cultivars with an increased concentration of micronutrients (biofortification) can address this problem. In this review, we describe seven transgenic approaches, and combinations thereof, that can be used to increase the concentration of Fe in rice seeds. The first approach is to enhance the Fe storage capacity of grains through expression of the Fe storage protein ferritin under the control of endosperm-specific promoters. Using this approach, the concentration of Fe in the seeds of transformants was increased by approximately 2-fold in polished seeds. The second approach is to enhance Fe translocation by overproducing the natural metal chelator nicotianamine; using this approach, the Fe concentration was increased by up to 3-fold in polished seeds. The third approach is to enhance Fe influx to the endosperm by expressing the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2 under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter, which increased the Fe concentration by up to 4-fold in polished seeds. The fourth approach is introduction of the barley mugineic acid synthesis gene IDS3 to enhance Fe uptake and translocation within plants, which resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the Fe concentration in polished seeds during field cultivation. In addition to the above approaches, Fe-biofortified rice was produced using a combination of the first, second, and third approaches. The Fe concentration in greenhouse-grown T2 polished seeds was 6-fold higher and that in paddy field-grown T3 polished seeds was 4.4-fold higher than in non-transgenic seeds without any reduction in yield. When the first and fourth approaches were combined, the Fe concentration was greater than that achieved by introducing only the ferritin gene, and Fe-deficiency tolerance was observed. With respect to Fe biofortification, the introduction of multiple Fe homeostasis genes is more effective than the introduction of individual genes. Moreover, three additional approaches, i.e., overexpression of the Fe transporter gene OsIRT1 or OsYSL15, overexpression of the Fe deficiency-inducible bHLH transcription factor OsIRO2, and knockdown of the vacuolar Fe transporter gene OsVIT1 or OsVIT2, may be useful to further increase the Fe concentration of seeds.
23999155	Bioactive polyketides and alkaloids from Penicillium citrinum, a fungal endophyte isolated from Ocimum tenuiflorum.	2013	Fitoterapia	Chemical investigation of the endophytic fungus Penicillium citrinum cultured on white beans or on rice led to the isolation of two new alkaloids (1 and 2), along with fourteen known polyketides (6-12, 14-20) and four known alkaloids (3-5, and 13). The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by extensive analysis of the 1D, 2D NMR, and MS data, and by comparison with the literature. Compound 13, which had been previously obtained only by chemical synthesis, was isolated as a natural product for the first time, while compound 6 was firstly reported as a fungal metabolite. A re-isolation of sclerotinin A (14) revealed it to be a diastereoisomeric mixture (14a and 14b), whose stereochemistry was proposed for the first time based on ROESY experiment. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic and antibacterial activities. Compounds 12 and 17 showed significant cytotoxicity against the murine lymphoma cell line L5178Y with IC50 values of 1.0, and 0.78 μg/ml, respectively, while compounds 5, 11, and 15 were moderately active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC 64 μg/ml).
24358300	Creating rat model for hypoxic brain damage in neonates by oxygen deprivation.	2013	PLoS One	Current study explores the feasibility of using a non-surgical method of oxygen deprivation to create Hypoxic brain damage in neonatal rats for medical studies. 7-day-old Sprague Dowley (SD) rats were kept in a container with low oxygen level (8%) for 1.5h. A second group had bilateral cephalic artery ligation before the 1.5h-low oxygen treatment, a method similar to the popular Rice method, to expose the brain to both hypoxic and ischemic situations. Short term neural functions and brain water weights were evaluated 1 day after the hypoxic treatment. Brain pathology and histology were also examined at 1 day and 3 days after the hypoxic treatment. Both groups showed impaired neural functions and increased brain water weight compared to the controls. Histology studies also revealed injuries in the subcortex, hippocampus and lateral ventricle in the brains from both groups. There is no significant difference in the degree of brain damages observed in the two groups. Our work demonstrated that oxygen deprivation alone is sufficient to cause brain damages similar to those seen in Hypoxic-ischemic brain disease (HIBD). Because this method avoids the invasive surgical procedure and therefore reduces the stress and mortality of laboratory animals during the experiment, we recommend it to be the favorable method for creating rat models for HIBD studies.
24341871	International Consortium of Rice Mutagenesis: resources and beyond.	2013	Rice (N Y)	Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. The rice community needs to cooperate and share efforts and resources so that we can understand the functions of rice genes, especially those with a role in important agronomical traits, for application in agricultural production. Mutation is a major source of genetic variation that can be used for studying gene function. We will present here the status of mutant collections affected in a random manner by physical/chemical and insertion mutageneses.As of early September 2013, a total of 447, 919 flanking sequence tags from rice mutant libraries with T-DNA, Ac/Ds, En/Spm, Tos17, nDART/aDART insertions have been collected and publicly available. From these, 336,262 sequences are precisely positioned on the japonica rice chromosomes, and 67.5% are in gene interval. We discuss the genome coverage and preference of the insertion, issues limiting the exchange and use of the current collections, as well as new and improved resources. We propose a call to renew all mutant populations as soon as possible. We also suggest that a common web portal should be established for ordering seeds.
24299927	An E3 ubiquitin ligase, ERECT LEAF1, functions in brassinosteroid signaling of rice.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	A spontaneous rice mutant, erect leaf1 (elf1-1), produced a dwarf phenotype with erect leaves and short grains. Physiological analyses suggested that elf1-1 is brassinosteroid-insensitive, so we hypothesized that ELF1 encodes a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling. ELF1, identified by means of positional cloning, encodes a protein with both a U-box domain and ARMADILLO (ARM) repeats. U-box proteins have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases; in fact, ELF1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. However, ELF1 itself does not appear to be polyubiquitinated. Mutant phenotypes of 2 more elf1 alleles indicate that the entire ARM repeats is indispensable for ELF1 activity. These results suggest that ELF1 ubiquitinates target proteins through an interaction mediated by ARM repeats. Similarities in the phenotypes of elf1 and d61 mutants (mutants of brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1), and in the regulation of ELF1 and OsBRI1 expression, imply that ELF1 functions as a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling in rice.
23999673	Aeroallergen sensitization in childhood asthmatics in northern India.	2013	Indian Pediatr	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sensitization to common aeroallergens in asthmatic children and study the differences in characteristics of atopics and non atopics.

DESIGN: Analysis of data from a prospective cohort study.

SETTING: Pediatric Chest Clinic of tertiary care center in Northern India.

PATIENTS: Asthmatic children from 5-18 year of age.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of sensitization to common aeroallergens.

RESULTS: Skin prick testing (SPT) was performed on 180 children above 5 years of age, with a mean (SD) age of 111.4 (34.2) months. 100 children (55.6%) were sensitized to at least one aeroallergen, suggesting atopy; 68 (37.8%) were sensitized to more than one allergen. 36.7% children were sensitized to housefly antigen; 31.1% to rice grain dust, 18.3% to cockroach, and 7.8% to house dust mite antigens. Atopic children had significantly higher median FENO during follow up than non-atopic children (17.5 ppb vs 13 ppb, P=0.002). There was a positive correlation between age and the number of allergens that an individual was sensitized to (r= 0.21; P=0.0049).

CONCLUSIONS: More than half of asthmatic children in our cohort had sensitization to one or more aeroallergens suggesting atopy; sensitization was most commonly seen to housefly antigen and rice grain dust. Atopic children had significantly higher FENO measurements during follow up as compared to non-atopic children.
24571556	Estimating marginal properties of quantitative real-time PCR data using nonlinear mixed models.	2014	Biometrics	A unified modeling framework based on a set of nonlinear mixed models is proposed for flexible modeling of gene expression in real-time PCR experiments. Focus is on estimating the marginal or population-based derived parameters: cycle thresholds and ΔΔc(t), but retaining the conditional mixed model structure to adequately reflect the experimental design. Additionally, the calculation of model-average estimates allows incorporation of the model selection uncertainty. The methodology is applied for estimating the differential expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPT6 in rice in comparison to a reference gene at several states after phosphate resupply. In a small simulation study the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to a standard method.
24336345	Uncovering DCL1-dependent small RNA loci on plant genomes: a structure-based approach.	2014	J Exp Bot	In plants, Dicer-like 1 (DCL1)-mediated two-step cleavages are essential for the processing of microRNA (miRNA) gene products. Interestingly, DCL1 has been indicated to be involved in the production of many small RNAs (sRNAs) that cannot be classified as canonical miRNAs. However, genomic and functional information on the non-miRNA, DCL1-dependent sRNAs is still limited. Here, we propose a secondary structure-based approach for identification of the precursors containing novel DCL1-dependent sRNA loci. To demonstrate the utility of the workflow: first, 5898 DCL1-dependent sRNAs of 20-24 nucleotides were identified from the sRNA high-throughput sequencing data sets prepared from rice DCL1 RNA interference transgenic lines. Those perfectly mapped to the rice pre-miRNAs (precursor microRNAs) were removed. The remaining 5795 sRNAs were then mapped onto the rice genome, obtaining 30 902 perfectly matched loci belonging to 2310 sRNAs. A total of 4631 clusters of sRNA loci were defined for secondary structure prediction by using RNAfold. The prediction results generated by two algorithms, namely MFE (minimum free energy) and centroid, were manually compared to identify the conserved long-stem structures containing DCL1-dependent sRNA loci. For the purpose of a case study, a portion of the prediction results was screened manually. As a result, 60 clusters displayed great potential for forming featured long-stem structures for the generation of DCL1-dependent sRNAs. Together, the results indicate that the proposed workflow is applicable for the identification of novel DCL1-dependent sRNA loci on plant genomes.
24306693	Molecular characterisation and evolution of HMW glutenin subunit genes in Brachypodium distachyon L.	2014	J Appl Genet	Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass within the Pooideae family, is a new model organism for exploring the functional genomics of cereal crops. It was shown to have close relationships to wheat, barley and rice. Here, we describe the molecular characterisation and evolutionary relationships of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) genes from B. distachyon. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses demonstrated that there was no HMW-GS expression in the Brachypodium grains due to the silencing of their encoding genes. Through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) amplification and cloning, a total of 13 HMW-GS encoding genes from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid Brachypodium species were obtained, and all of them had typical structural features of y-type HMW-GS genes from common wheat and related species, particularly more similar to the 1Dy12 gene. However, the presence of an in-frame premature stop codon (TAG) at position 1521 in the coding region resulted in the conversion of all the genes to pseudogenes. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that HMW-GS genes in B. distachyon displayed a similar trend, but with a low transcriptional expression profile during grain development due to the occurrence of the stop codon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the highly conserved Glu-1-2 loci were presented in B. distachyon, which displayed close phylogenetic evolutionary relationships with Triticum and related species.
24367635	Comparison of SSR and SNP markers in estimation of genetic diversity and population structure of Indian rice varieties.	2013	PLoS One	Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP), the two most robust markers for identifying rice varieties were compared for assessment of genetic diversity and population structure. Total 375 varieties of rice from various regions of India archived at the Indian National GeneBank, NBPGR, New Delhi, were analyzed using thirty six genetic markers, each of hypervariable SSR (HvSSR) and SNP which were distributed across 12 rice chromosomes. A total of 80 alleles were amplified with the SSR markers with an average of 2.22 alleles per locus whereas, 72 alleles were amplified with SNP markers. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values for HvSSR ranged from 0.04 to 0.5 with an average of 0.25. In the case of SNP markers, PIC values ranged from 0.03 to 0.37 with an average of 0.23. Genetic relatedness among the varieties was studied; utilizing an unrooted tree all the genotypes were grouped into three major clusters with both SSR and SNP markers. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that maximum diversity was partitioned between and within individual level but not between populations. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with SSR markers showed that genotypes were uniformly distributed across the two axes with 13.33% of cumulative variation whereas, in case of SNP markers varieties were grouped into three broad groups across two axes with 45.20% of cumulative variation. Population structure were tested using K values from 1 to 20, but there was no clear population structure, therefore Ln(PD) derived Δk was plotted against the K to determine the number of populations. In case of SSR maximum Δk was at K=5 whereas, in case of SNP maximum Δk was found at K=15, suggesting that resolution of population was higher with SNP markers, but SSR were more efficient for diversity analysis.
24467897	Overexpression of the receptor-like protein kinase genes AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 reduces the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana.	2014	Plant Sci	AtRPK1 (AT1G69270) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The rice gene Os07g0602700 (OsRPK1) is the homolog of AtRPK1. AtRPK1 and OsRPK1 were overexpressed and the expression of AtRPK1 was inhibited by RNAi in A. thaliana. The functional results showed that the degrees of salt tolerance of the 35S:RPK1 A. thaliana plants were significantly lower than that of the control plants. The AtRPK1-RNAi A. thaliana plants exhibited higher salt tolerance than the wild-type plants (Col). The subcellular localisation results showed that the RPK1 proteins were mainly distributed on the cell membrane and that the overexpressed AtRPK1 proteins exhibited a significantly clustered distribution. The physiological analyses revealed that the overexpression of the RPK1 genes increased the membrane permeability in the transgenic A. thaliana plants. In response to salt stress, these plants exhibited an increased Na(+) flux into the cell, which caused greater damage to the cell. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression of the P5CS1 gene was inhibited and the SOS signalling pathway was blocked in the 35S:AtRPK1 A. thaliana plants. These effects at least partially contribute to the salt-sensitive phenotype of the 35S:RPK1 plants.
24324328	Estrogen receptor modulatory effects of germinated brown rice bioactives in the uterus of rats through the regulation of estrogen-induced genes.	2013	Drug Des Devel Ther	PURPOSE: The expression of genes regulated by estrogen in the uterus was studied in ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with germinated brown rice (GBR) bioactives, and compared to Remifemin or estrogen at different doses to identify the regulation of these genes in the uterus and their molecular mechanisms.

METHODS: Rats were treated orally with GBR bioactives (phenolics), acylated steryl glucosides (ASG), γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), and γ-oryzanol (ORZ) at 100 and 200 mg/kg, Remifemin (REM) at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, or estrogen (EST) at 0.2 mg/kg. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the uterus, and messenger (m)RNA expression of selected genes encoding estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β), calcium-binding protein (CaBP9k), complement protein (C3), heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70), and interleukin (IL)-4 receptor were quantified. Similarly, serum steroid hormone concentration was monitored at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after treatments. ER-β antibody binding to the uterus sections was also studied using immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS: The group treated with EST (0.2 mg/kg) upregulated ER-β, C3, and IL-4 receptor genes compared to other groups (P<0.001). GBR phenolics (200 mg/kg) treatment upregulated the ER-β gene almost to the level of the sham non-treated group. The CaBP9k gene showed upregulation in groups treated with ASG (200 mg/kg), EST (0.2 mg/kg), and ORZ (200 mg/kg) (P<0.05). Estrogen levels increased in groups treated with EST, ASG, and ORZ (200 mg/kg) compared to the OVX untreated group (P<0.05), and there was a slight non-significant decrease (P>0.05) in the progesterone levels in the OVX untreated group compared to the sham and other treated groups. There was a significant increase at 8 weeks in the level of FSH (P<0.05) in the treated groups compared to the OVX untreated group. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) between the OVX untreated group and other groups. The sham and GBR phenolics treated group showed ER-β reactivity at the glandular epithelium, while the group treated with EST showed immunoreactivity at the glandular, luminal, and stromal epithelium.

CONCLUSION: GBR phenolics moderately regulate the expression of ER-β, HSP70, and IL-4 receptor genes, and gave a positive immunoreaction to ER-β antigen in the uterus. ASG regulates the expression of CaBP9k and IL-4 receptor genes, and ORZ regulates the expression of the CaBP9k gene, while GABA at 100 mg/kg regulates the expression of the HSP70 gene. GBR and its bioactives might have an effect on estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of rats.

22160725	Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains.	2011	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains poses a potential health problem, especially in Asia. Most Cd in rice grains accumulates through phloem transport, but the molecular mechanism of this transport has not been revealed. In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, OsLCT1, involved in Cd transport to the grains. OsLCT1-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and OsLCT1 showed Cd efflux activity in yeast. In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage. In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles. RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport. The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants. The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression. These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of "low-Cd rice" without negative effects on agronomical traits. These findings identify a transporter gene for phloem Cd transport in plants.
22189955	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice.	2012	Planta	OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) family in rice (Oryza sativa) isolated from rice (Zhonghua11) panicles. Expression of the OsbZIP52 gene was strongly induced by low temperature (4°C) but not by drought, PEG, salt, or ABA. The subcellular localization of OsbZIP52-GFP in onion (Allium cepa) epidermis cells revealed that OsbZIP52 is a nuclear localized protein. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP52 functions as a transcriptional activator and can specifically bind to the G-box promoter motif. In a yeast two-hybrid (Y-2-H) experiment, OsbZIP52 was able to form homodimeric complexes. Rice plants overexpressing OsbZIP52 showed significantly increased sensitivity to cold and drought stress. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, β-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines. These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments.
22212404	The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes the systemic induction of regulatory defence-related genes in rice leaves and confers resistance to pathogen infection.	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses are mutualistic associations between soil fungi and most vascular plants. Their association benefits the host plant by improving nutrition, mainly phosphorus nutrition, and by providing increased capability to cope with adverse conditions. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional changes triggered in rice leaves as a result of AM symbiosis, focusing on the relevance of the plant defence response. We showed that root colonization by the AM fungus Glomus intraradices is accompanied by the systemic induction of genes that play a regulatory role in the host defence response, such as OsNPR1, OsAP2, OsEREBP and OsJAmyb. Genes involved in signal transduction processes (OsDUF26 and OsMPK6) and genes that function in calcium-mediated signalling processes (OsCBP, OsCaM and OsCML4) are also up-regulated in leaves of mycorrhizal rice plants in the absence of pathogen infection. In addition, the mycorrhizal rice plants exhibit a stronger induction of defence marker genes [i.e. pathogenesis-related (PR) genes] in their leaves in response to infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Evidence indicates that mycorrhizal rice plants show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. Overall, these results suggest that the protective effect of the AM symbiosis in rice plants relies on both the systemic activation of defence regulatory genes in the absence of pathogen challenge and the priming for stronger expression of defence effector genes during pathogen infection. The possible mechanisms involved in the mycorrhiza-induced resistance to M. oryzae infection are discussed.
22196946	Involvement of hydrogen peroxide in heat shock- and cadmium-induced expression of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in leaves of rice seedlings.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.
22199238	Conservation of IRE1-regulated bZIP74 mRNA unconventional splicing in rice (Oryza sativa L.) involved in ER stress responses.	2012	Mol Plant	Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a fundamental process in plant cells that is vulnerable to many environmental stresses. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the well-conserved unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated to mitigate the ER stress by enhancing the protein folding capability and/or accelerating the ER-associated protein degradation. Here, we report the conservation of the activation mechanism of OsbZIP74 (also known as OsbZIP50), an important ER stress regulator in monocot plant rice (Oryza sativa L.). Under normal conditions, OsbZIP74 mRNA encodes a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with a putative transmembrane domain. When treating with ER stress-inducing agents such as tunicamycin and DTT, the conserved double stem-loop structures of OsbZIP74 mRNA are spliced out. Thereafter, the resulting new OsbZIP74 mRNA produces the nucleus-localized form of OsbZIP74 protein, eliminating the hydrophobic region. The activated form of OsbZIP74 has transcriptional activation activity in both yeast cells and Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. The induction of OsbZIP74 splicing is much suppressed in the OsIRE1 knock-down rice plants, indicating the involvement of OsIRE1 in OsbZIP74 splicing. We also demonstrate that the unconventional splicing of OsbZIP74 mRNA is associated with heat stress and salicylic acid, which is an important plant hormone in systemic acquired resistance against pathogen or parasite.
22201023	Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Mol Biol Rep	The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system is important in the quality control of intracellular proteins. The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system includes the E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. U-box proteins are a derived version of RING-finger domains, which have E3 enzyme activity. Here, we present the isolation of a novel U-box protein, U-box containing E3 ligase induced by phosphate starvation (OsUPS), from rice (Oryza sativa). The cDNA encoding the O. sativa U-box protein (OsUPS) comprises 1338 bp, with an open reading frame of 445 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of OsUPS cDNA shows 41-79% identity with other plant U-box homologous genes. The open reading frame of the OsUPS protein is comprised of notable domains: a single ~70-amino acid domain and a GKL domain that contains conserved glycine, lysine/arginine residues and leucine-rich feature. We found that full-length expression of OsUPS was up-regulated in both rice plants and cell culture in the absence of inorganic phosphate (P(i)). A self-ubiquitination assay indicated that the bacterially expressed OsUPS protein had E3 ligase activity, and subcellular localization results showed that OsUPS was located in the chloroplast. These results support the notion that OsUPS plays an important role in the P(i) signaling pathway through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system.
22284711	ZmHO-1, a maize haem oxygenase-1 gene, plays a role in determining lateral root development.	2012	Plant Sci	Previous results revealed that haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/carbon monoxide (CO) system is involved in auxin-induced adventitious root formation. In this report, a cDNA for the gene ZmHO-1, encoding an HO-1 protein, was cloned from Zea mays seedlings. ZmHO-1 has a conserved HO signature sequence and shares highest homology with rice SE5 (OsHO-1) protein. We further discovered that N-1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA), haemin, and CO aqueous solution, led to the induction of ZmHO-1 expression as well as the thereafter promotion of lateral root development. These effects were specific for ZmHO-1 since the potent HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) differentially blocked the above actions. The addition of haemin and CO were able to reverse the auxin depletion-triggered inhibition of lateral root formation as well as the decreased ZmHO-1 transcripts. Molecular evidence showed that the haemin- or CO-mediated the modulation of target genes responsible for lateral root formation, including ZmCDK and ZmCKI2, could be blocked by ZnPPIX. Overexpression of ZmHO-1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in promotion of lateral root development as well as the modulation of cell cycle regulatory gene expressions. Overall, our results suggested that a maize HO-1 gene is required for the lateral root formation.
22228185	Activation of Rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification.	2012	Mol Cells	Because micronutrients in human diets ultimately come from plant sources, malnutrition of essential minerals is a significant public health concern. By increasing the expression of nicotianamine synthase (NAS), we fortified the level of bioavailable iron in rice seeds. Activation of iron deficiency-inducible OsNAS2 resulted in a rise in Fe content (3.0-fold) in mature seeds. Its ectopic expression also increased that content. Enhanced expression led to higher tolerance of Fe deficiency and better growth under elevated pH. Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from anemia, indicating that bioavailable Fe contents were improved by this increase in OsNAS2 expression.
22350999	Selection of transgenic rice plants using a herbicide tolerant form of the acetolactate synthase gene.	2012	Methods Mol Biol	Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for branched-chain amino acids, and bispyribac-sodium (BS), a pyrimidinyl carboxy herbicide, is a well-known inhibitor of ALS activity. However, it appears that a mutated form of rice ALS [OsmALS (W548L/S627I)] confers resistance to BS. We succeeded in using OsmALS with native OsALS promoter and terminator region for a selection marker of rice transformation. Because this selection marker cassette is originally from the rice endogenous genome, it can be expected to be publicly acceptable.
22274888	Identification of an active Mutator-like element (MULE) in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	Transposable elements (TEs) represent an important fraction of plant genomes and play a significant role in gene and genome evolution. Among all TE superfamilies discovered in plants, Mutator from maize (Zea mays) is the most active and mutagenic element. Mutator-like elements (MULEs) were identified in a wide range of plants. However, only few active MULEs have been reported, and the transposition mechanism of the elements is still poorly understood. In this study, an active MULE named Os3378 was discovered in rice (Oryza sativa) by a combination of computational and experimental approaches. The four newly identified Os3378 elements share more than 98% sequence identity between each other, and all of them encode transposases without any deletion derivatives, indicating their capability of autonomous transposition. Os3378 is present in the rice species with AA genome type but is absent in other non-AA genome species. A new insertion of Os3378 was identified in a rice somaclonal mutant Z418, and the element remained active in the descendants of the mutant for more than ten generations. Both germinal and somatic excision events of Os3378 were observed, and no footprint was detected after excision. Furthermore, the occurrence of somatic excision of Os3378 appeared to be associated with plant developmental stages and tissue types. Taken together, Os3378 is a unique active element in rice, which provides a valuable resource for further studying of transposition mechanism and evolution of MULEs.
22264357	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing osmotic signals, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network that induces second messengers and triggers inducible defense responses. Characteristic early signaling events include Ca2+ influx, protein phosphorylation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pharmacological analyses show Ca2+ influx mediated by mechanosensitive Ca2+ channels to influence induction of osmotic signals, including ROS generation. However, molecular bases and regulatory mechanisms for early osmotic signaling events remain poorly elucidated.

RESULTS: We here identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole rice homolog of putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels in Arabidopsis (MCAs). OsMCA1 was specifically localized at the plasma membrane. A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice. Ca2+ uptake was enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing suspension-cultured cells, suggesting that OsMCA1 is involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Hypo-osmotic shock-induced ROS generation mediated by NADPH oxidases was also enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing cells. We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels.

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a sole MCA ortholog in the rice genome and developed both overexpression and suppression lines. Analyses of cultured cells with altered levels of this putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channel indicate that OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and ROS generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells. These findings shed light on our understanding of mechanical sensing pathways.
22228180	Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency.	2012	Mol Cells	Graminaceous plants release ferric-chelating phytosiderophores that bind to iron. These ferric-phytosiderophore complexes are transported across the plasma membrane by a protein produced from Yellow Stripe 1 (YS1). Here, we report the characterization of OsYSL16, one of the YS1-like genes in rice. Real-time analysis revealed that this gene was constitutively expressed irrespective of metal status. Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to β-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells. The OsYSL16-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. From a pool of rice T-DNA insertional lines, we identified two independent activation-tagging mutants in OsYSL16. On an Fe-deficient medium, those mutants retained relatively high chlorophyll concentrations compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, indicating that they are more tolerant to a lack of iron. The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT. During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds. Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant.
22246661	The rice Osmyb4 gene enhances tolerance to frost and improves germination under unfavourable conditions in transgenic barley plants.	2012	J Appl Genet	The Osmyb4 rice gene, coding for a transcription factor, proved to be efficient against different abiotic stresses as a trans(cis)gene in several plant species, although the effectiveness was dependent on the host genomic background. Eight barley transgenic lines carrying the rice Osmyb4 gene under the control of the Arabidopsis cold inducible promoter cor15a were produced to test the efficiency of this gene in barley. After a preliminary test, the best performing lines were subjected to freezing at -11°C and -12°C. Frost tolerance was assessed measured the F(v)/F(m) parameter widely used to indicate the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry in the dark adapted state. Three transgenic lines showed significantly increased tolerance. These selected lines were further studied under a complex stress applying cold and hypoxia at germinating stage. In these conditions the three selected transgenic lines outperformed the wild type barley in terms of germination vigour. The transgenic plants also showed a significant modification of their metabolism under cold/hypoxia conditions as demonstrated through the assessment of the activity of key enzymes involved in anoxic stress response. None of the transgenic lines showed dwarfism, just a slight retarded growth. These results provide evidence that the cold dependent expression of Osmyb4 can efficiently improved frost tolerance and germination vigour at low temperature without deleterious effect on plant growth.
22247270	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism.	2012	Plant Physiol	All higher plants contain an ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), as such a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 701 family member is required for gibberellin (GA) phytohormone biosynthesis. While gene expansion and functional diversification of GA-biosynthesis-derived diterpene synthases into more specialized metabolism has been demonstrated, no functionally divergent KO/CYP701 homologs have been previously identified. Rice (Oryza sativa) contains five CYP701A subfamily members in its genome, despite the fact that only one (OsKO2/CYP701A6) is required for GA biosynthesis. Here we demonstrate that one of the other rice CYP701A subfamily members, OsKOL4/CYP701A8, does not catalyze the prototypical conversion of the ent-kaurene C4α-methyl to a carboxylic acid, but instead carries out hydroxylation at the nearby C3α position in a number of related diterpenes. In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3α-hydroxylated diterpenoids. These compounds are expected intermediates in biosynthesis of the oryzalexin and phytocassane families of rice antifungal phytoalexins, respectively, and can be detected in rice plants under the appropriate conditions. Thus, it appears that OsKOL4 plays a role in the more specialized diterpenoid metabolism of rice, and our results provide evidence for divergence of a KO/CYP701 family member from GA biosynthesis. This further expands the range of enzymes recruited from the ancestral GA primary pathway to the more complex and specialized labdane-related diterpenoid metabolic network found in rice.
22218675	OsPFA-DSP1, a rice protein tyrosine phosphatase, negatively regulates drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco and rice plants.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Dephosphorylation plays a pivotal role in regulating plant growth, development and abiotic/biotic stress responses. Here, we characterized a plant and fungi atypical dual-specificity phosphatase (PFA-DSP) subfamily member, OsPFA-DSP1, from rice. OsPFA-DSP1 was determined to be a functional protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in vitro using phosphatase activity assays. Quantitative real-time PCR and GENEVESTIGATOR analysis showed that OsPFA-DSP1 mRNA was induced by drought stress. Transfection of rice protoplasts showed that OsPFA-DSP1 accumulated in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in tobacco increased sensitivity to drought stress and insensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. Furthermore, overexpression of OsPFA-DSP1 in rice also increased sensitivity to drought stress. These results indicated that OsPFA-DSP1 is a functional PTP and may act as a negative regulator in drought stress responses.
22285622	Characterization of hydroxycinnamoyltransferase from rice and its application for biological synthesis of hydroxycinnamoyl glycerols.	2012	Phytochemistry	Hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs) catalyze the transfer of the cinnamoyl moiety from hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA to various acceptors such as shikimic acid, quinic acid, hydroxylated acid, and glycerol. Four rice HCT homologues (OsHCT1-4) to tobacco HST were cloned, and OsHCT4 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Using the purified recombinant protein and biotransformation techniques, whether OsHCT4 shows hydroxycinnamoyltransferase activity with a variety of acyl group acceptors was investigated. The results of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) established that OsHCT4 mediated the trans-esterification of glycerol as well as shikimic acid in the presence of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA. The structure of the reaction product was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). E. coli cells co-expressing 4CL (4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase) and OsHCT4 converted p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid into the corresponding glycerides. While this conversion is very efficient in vitro, the physiological significant in rice is currently unknown.
22253868	OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice.	2012	PLoS One	The microRNA miR393 has been shown to play a role in plant development and in the stress response by targeting mRNAs that code for the auxin receptors in Arabidopsis. In this study, we verified that two rice auxin receptor gene homologs (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2) could be targeted by OsmiR393 (Os for Oryza sativa). Two new phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and two previously observed phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and drought and hyposensitivity to auxin) were observed in the OsmiR393-overexpressing rice plants. The OsmiR393-overexpressing rice demonstrated hyposensitivity to synthetic auxin-analog treatments. These data indicated that the phenotypes of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice may be caused through hyposensitivity to the auxin signal by reduced expression of two auxin receptor genes (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2). The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering. The positive phenotypes (increased tillers and early flowering) and negative phenotypes (reduced tolerance to salt and hyposensitivity to auxin) of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice present a dilemma for molecular breeding.
22248237	The double-stranded break-forming activity of plant SPO11s and a novel rice SPO11 revealed by a Drosophila bioassay.	2012	BMC Mol Biol	BACKGROUND: SPO11 is a key protein for promoting meiotic recombination, by generating chromatin locus- and timing-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The DSB activity of SPO11 was shown by genetic analyses, but whether SPO11 exerts DSB-forming activity by itself is still an unanswered question. DSB formation by SPO11 has not been detected by biochemical means, probably because of a lack of proper protein-folding, posttranslational modifications, and/or specific SPO11-interacting proteins required for this activity. In addition, plants have multiple SPO11-homologues.

RESULTS: To determine whether SPO11 can cleave DNA by itself, and to identify which plant SPO11 homologue cleaves DNA, we developed a Drosophila bioassay system that detects the DSB signals generated by a plant SPO11 homologue expressed ectopically. We cytologically and genetically demonstrated the DSB activities of Arabidopsis AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, which are required for meiosis, in the absence of other plant proteins. Using this bioassay, we further found that a novel SPO11-homologue, OsSPO11D, which has no counterpart in Arabidopsis, displays prominent DSB-forming activity. Quantitative analyses of the rice SPO11 transcripts revealed the specific increase in OsSPO11D mRNA in the anthers containing meiotic pollen mother cells.

CONCLUSIONS: The Drosophila bioassay system successfully demonstrated that some plant SPO11 orthologues have intrinsic DSB activities. Furthermore, we identified a novel SPO11 homologue, OsSPO11D, with robust DSB activity and a possible meiotic function.
22226678	C-terminal residues of oryza sativa GUN4 are required for the activation of the ChlH subunit of magnesium chelatase in chlorophyll synthesis.	2012	FEBS Lett	Oryza sativa GUN4 together with the magnesium chelatase subunits ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH have been heterologously expressed and purified to reconstitute magnesium chelatase activity in vitro. Maximum magnesium chelatase activity requires pre-activation of OsChlH with OsGUN4, Mg(2+) and protoporphyrin-IX. OsGUN4 and OsChlH preincubated without protoporphyrin-IX yields magnesium chelatase activity similar to assays without OsGUN4, suggesting formation of a dead-end complex. Either 9 or 10 C-terminal amino acids of OsGUN4 are slowly hydrolyzed to yield a truncated OsGUN4. These truncated OsGUN4 still bind protoporphyrin-IX and Mg-protoporphyrin-IX but are unable to activate OsChlH. This suggests the mechanism of GUN4 activation of magnesium chelatase is different in eukaryotes compared to cyanobacteria as the orthologous cyanobacterial GUN4 proteins lack this C-terminal extension.
22286138	The YABBY gene TONGARI-BOUSHI1 is involved in lateral organ development and maintenance of meristem organization in the rice spikelet.	2012	Plant Cell	The meristem initiates lateral organs in a regular manner, and proper communication between the meristem and the lateral organs ensures the normal development of plants. Here, we show that mutation of the rice (Oryza sativa) gene TONGARI-BOUSHI1 (TOB1) results in pleiotropic phenotypes in spikelets, such as the formation of a cone-shaped organ instead of the lemma or palea, the development of two florets in a spikelet, or premature termination of the floret meristem, in addition to reduced growth of the lemma or palea and elongation of the awn. These phenotypes seem to result from not only failure in growth of the lateral organs, but also defects in maintenance and organization of the meristem. For example, the cone-shaped organ develops as a ring-like primordium from an initial stage, suggesting that regulation of organ initiation in the meristem may be compromised. TOB1 encodes a YABBY protein, which is closely related to FILAMENTOUS FLOWER in Arabidopsis thaliana, and is expressed in the lateral organ primordia without any patterns of polarization. No TOB1 expression is detected in the meristem, so TOB1 may act non-cell autonomously to maintain proper meristem organization and is therefore likely to play an important role in rice spikelet development.
22286805	A mutation in the rice chalcone isomerase gene causes the golden hull and internode 1 phenotype.	2012	Planta	The biosynthesis of flavonoids, important secondary plant metabolites, has been investigated extensively, but few mutants of genes in this pathway have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). The rice gold hull and internode (gh) mutants exhibit a reddish-brown pigmentation in the hull and internode and their phenotype has long been used as a morphological marker trait for breeding and genetic study. Here, we characterized that the gh1 mutant was a mutant of the rice chalcone isomerase gene (OsCHI). The result showed that gh1 had a Dasheng retrotransposon inserted in the 5′ UTR of the OsCHI gene, which resulted in the complete loss of OsCHI expression. gh1 exhibited golden pigmentation in hulls and internodes once the panicles were exposed to light. The total flavonoid content in gh1 hulls was increased threefold compared to wild type. Consistent with the gh1 phenotype, OsCHI transcripts were expressed in most tissues of rice and most abundantly in internodes. It was also expressed at high levels in panicles before heading, distributed mainly in lemmas and paleae, but its expression decreased substantially after the panicles emerged from the sheath. OsCHI encodes a protein functionally and structurally conserved to chalcone isomerases in other species. Our findings demonstrated that the OsCHI gene was indispensable for flux of the flavonoid pathway in rice.
22341501	Exchanging a single amino acid residue generates or weakens a +2 cellooligosaccharide binding subsite in rice β-glucosidases.	2012	Carbohydr Res	Os3BGlu6, Os3BGlu7, and Os4BGlu12 are rice glycoside hydrolase family 1 β-glucosidases, the structures of which have been solved by X-ray crystallography. In complex structures, Os3BGlu7 residue Asn245 hydrogen bonds to the second sugar in the +1 subsite for laminaribiose and the third sugar in the +2 subsite for cellotetraose and cellopentaose. The corresponding Os3BGlu6 residue, Met251, appears to block the binding of cellooligosaccharides at the +2 subsite, whereas His252 in this position in Os4BGlu12 could hydrogen bond to oligosaccharides. Mutation of Os3BGlu6 Met251 to Asn resulted in a 15-fold increased k(cat)/K(m) value for hydrolysis of laminaribiose compared to wild type Os3BGlu6 and 9 to 24-fold increases for cellooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) of 2-5. On the other hand, mutation of Os3BGlu7 Asn245 to Met decreased the k(cat)/K(m) of hydrolysis by 6.5-fold for laminaribiose and 17 to 30-fold for cellooligosaccharides with DP >2, while mutation of Os4BGlu12 His252 to Met decreased the corresponding k(cat)/K(m) values 2 to 6-fold.
22368778	Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport.	2012	Sci Rep	Metals like manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential for metabolism, while cadmium (Cd) is toxic for virtually all living organisms. Understanding the transport of these metals is important for breeding better crops. We have identified that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Fe and Cd transport in rice. OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem. OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport. OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap. The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation. These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development.
22262313	Heme oxygenase is involved in nitric oxide- and auxin-induced lateral root formation in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Lateral root (LR) development performs the essential tasks of providing water, nutrients, and physical support to plants. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. In this study, we examined the effect of nitric oxide (NO), auxin, and hemin (Hm) on LR formation in rice. Treatment with Hm [a highly effective heme oxygenase (HO) inducer], sodium nitroprusside (SNP, an NO donor), or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA, a naturally occurring auxin) induced LR formation and HO activity. LR formation and HO activity induced by SNP and IBA but not Hm was reduced by the specific NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. As well, Hm, SNP, and IBA could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zn protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin (the carbon monoxide/NO scavenger) reduced LR number and HO activity induced by Hm, SNP, and IBA. Our data suggest that HO is required for Hm-, auxin-, and NO-induced LR formation in rice.
22247560	The OsGEN-L protein from Oryza sativa possesses Holliday junction resolvase activity as well as 5'-flap endonuclease activity.	2012	J Biochem	OsGEN-L has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development. The Class 4 RAD2/XPG family nucleases, including OsGEN-L, were recently found to have resolving activity for the Holliday junction (HJ), the intermediate of DNA strand recombination. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of OsGEN-L, as a structure-specific endonuclease. Highly purified OsGEN-L was prepared as the full-length protein for in vitro endonuclease assays using various structured DNAs, and the 5'-flap endonuclease activity, which is stimulated in a PCNA-dependent manner, was demonstrated. In addition, the in vitro HJ resolving activity of OsGEN-L represents the first such activity originating from plant cells. OsGEN-L cleaved HJ at symmetrically related sites of the branch point. However, the two branched strands seemed to be cleaved individually, and not cooperatively, by each OsGEN-L monomer protein. The substrate specificity suggests that OsGEN-L functions in multiple processes of DNA metabolism in rice cells.
22448275	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays a vital role in regulation of rice seed vigor via altering NADPH oxidase activity.	2012	PLoS One	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses. In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity. Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination. And then, the signal cascades that PI3K promoted the ROS liberation was also evaluated. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed most of ROS generation in rice seed germination, which suggested that NADPH oxidase was the main source of ROS in this process. Pharmacological experiment and RT-PCR demonstrated that PI3K promoted the expression of Os rboh9. Moreover, functional analysis by native PAGE and the measurement of the 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-lium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) formazan concentration both showed that PI3K promoted the activity of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the western blot analysis of OsRac-1 demonstrated that the translocation of Rac-1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, which was known as a key factor in the assembly of NADPH oxidase, was suppressed by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, resulting in the decreased activity of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination.
22308482	A long noncoding RNA regulates photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, an essential component of hybrid rice.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Hybrid rice has greatly contributed to the global increase of rice productivity. A major component that facilitated the development of hybrids was a mutant showing photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) with its fertility regulated by day length. Transcriptome studies have shown that large portions of the eukaryotic genomic sequences are transcribed to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, the potential roles for only a few lncRNAs have been brought to light at present. Thus, great efforts have to be invested to understand the biological functions of lncRNAs. Here we show that a lncRNA of 1,236 bases in length, referred to as long-day-specific male-fertility-associated RNA (LDMAR), regulates PSMS in rice. We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions. A spontaneous mutation causing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between the wild-type and mutant altered the secondary structure of LDMAR. This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS. Thus, a lncRNA could directly exert a major effect on a trait like a structure gene, and a SNP could alter the function of a lncRNA similar to amino acid substitution in structural genes. Molecular elucidating of PSMS has important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of photoperiod regulation of many biological processes and also for developing male sterile germplasms for hybrid crop breeding.
22278768	Divergent functions of orthologous NAC transcription factors in wheat and rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	The wheat GPC-B1 gene located on chromosome 6B is an early regulator of senescence and affects remobilization of protein and minerals to the grain. GPC-B1 is a NAC transcription factor and has a paralogous copy on chromosome 2B in wheat, GPC-B2. The closest rice homolog to both wheat GPC genes is Os07g37920 which is located on rice chromosome 7 and is colinear with GPC-B2. Since rice is a diploid species with a sequenced genome, we initiated the study of Os07g37920 to develop a simpler model to study senescence and mineral remobilization in cereals. We developed eleven independent RNA interference transgenic rice lines (Os07g37920-RNAi) and 10 over-expressing transgenic lines (Os07g37920-OE), but none of them showed differences in senescence. Transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi rice plants had reduced proportions of viable pollen grains and were male-sterile, but were able to produce seeds by cross pollination. Analysis of the flower morphology of the transgenic rice plants showed that anthers failed to dehisce. Transgenic Os07g37920-OE lines showed no sterility or anther dehiscence problems. Os07g37920 transcript levels were higher in stamens compared to leaves and significantly reduced in the transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi plants. Wheat GPC genes showed the opposite transcription profile (higher transcript levels in leaves than in flowers) and plants carrying knock-out mutations of all GPC-1 and GPC-2 genes exhibited delayed senescence but normal anther dehiscence and fertility. These results indicate a functional divergence of the homologous wheat and rice NAC genes and suggest the need for separate studies of the function and targets of these transcription factors in wheat and rice.
22247252	The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162.	2012	Plant Cell	The cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) phenotype in plants can be reversed by the action of nuclear-encoded fertility restorer (Rf) genes. The molecular mechanism involved in Rf gene-mediated processing of CMS-associated transcripts is unclear, as are the identities of other proteins that may be involved in the CMS-Rf interaction. In this study, we cloned the restorer gene Rf5 for Hong-Lian CMS in rice and studied its fertility restoration mechanism with respect to the processing of the CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79. RF5, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, was unable to bind to this CMS-associated transcript; however, a partner protein of RF5 (GRP162, a Gly-rich protein encoding 162 amino acids) was identified to bind to atp6-orfH79. GRP162 was found to physically interact with RF5 and to bind to atp6-orfH79 via an RNA recognition motif. Furthermore, we found that RF5 and GRP162 are both components of a restoration of fertility complex (RFC) that is 400 to 500 kD in size and can cleave CMS-associated transcripts in vitro. Evidence that a PPR protein interacts directly with a Gly-rich protein to form a subunit of the RFC provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying fertility restoration.
22195590	Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6.	2012	Plant Sci	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsAPC6 of rice, with gibberellic acid insensitivity and reduced height, had up to 45% reduced seed set. The insertion occurred on chromosome 3 of rice in the gene encoding one of the subunits of anaphase promoting complex/Cyclosome APC6. The primary mother cells of the mutant plants had normal meiosis, male gametophyte development and pollen viability. Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) studies of megagametophyte development showed abnormal mitotic divisions with reduced number or total absence of polar nuclei in about 30-35% megagametophytes of OsAPC6 mutant leading to failure of endosperm and hence embryo and seed development. Abnormal female gametophyte development, high sterility and segregation of tall and gibberellic acid sensitive plants without selectable marker Hpt in the selfed progeny of OsAPC6 mutant plants indicate that the mutant could be maintained in heterozygous condition. The abnormal mitotic divisions during megagametogenesis could be attributed to the inactivation of the APC6/CDC16 of anaphase promoting complex of rice responsible for cell cycle progression during megagametogenesis. Functional validation of the candidate gene through transcriptome profiling and RNAi is in progress.
22367534	Oligomerization of the reversibly glycosylated polypeptide: its role during rice plant development and in the regulation of self-glycosylation.	2013	Protoplasma	A multigenic family of self-glycosylating proteins named reversibly glycosylated polypeptides, designated as RGPs, have been usually associated with carbohydrate metabolism, although they are an enigma both at the functional, as well as at the structural level. In this work, we used biochemical approaches to demonstrate that complex formation is linked to rice plant development, in which class 1 Oryza sativa RGP (OsRGP) would be involved in an early stage of growing plants, while class 2 OsRGP would be associated with a late stage linked to an active polysaccharide synthesis that occurs during the elongation of plant. Here, a further investigation of the complex formation of the Solanum tuberosum RGP (StRGP) was performed. Results showed that disulfide bonds are at least partially responsible for maintaining the oligomeric protein structure, so that the nonreduced StRGP protein showed an apparent higher molecular weight and a lower radioglycosylation of the monomer with respect to its reduced form. Hydrophobic cluster analysis and secondary structure prediction revealed that class 2 RGPs no longer maintained the Rossman fold described for class 1 RGP. A 3D structure of the StRGP protein resolved by homology modeling supports the possibility of intercatenary disulfide bridges formed by exposed cysteines residues C79, C303 and C251 and they are most probably involved in complex formation occurring into the cell cytoplasm.
22301130	Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought tolerance in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	OsbZIP46 is one member of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa). It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and OsbZIP23, two transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively. Expression of OsbZIP46 was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses. Overexpression of the native OsbZIP46 gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought resistance. The activation domain of OsbZIP46 was defined by a series of deletions, and a region (domain D) was identified as having a negative effect on the activation. We produced a constitutive active form of OsbZIP46 (OsbZIP46CA1) with a deletion of domain D. Overexpression of OsbZIP46CA1 in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses. Gene chip analysis of the two overexpressors (native OsbZIP46 and the constitutive active form OsbZIP46CA1) revealed that a large number of stress-related genes, many of them predicted to be downstream genes of ABF/AREBs, were activated in the OsbZIP46CA1 overexpressor but not (even down-regulated) in the OsbZIP46 overexpressor. OsbZIP46 can interact with homologs of SnRK2 protein kinases that phosphorylate ABFs in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that OsbZIP46 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its activation. The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
22362377	Expression profile analysis of the polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein genes in rice and their responses to phytohormones and fungal infection.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	UNLABELLED: Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are typically leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins that can inhibit the activity of fungal polygalacturonases (PGs). In this study, two new Ospgip genes, named Ospgip6 and Ospgip7 with consensus sequence of ten imperfect LRR motif located on rice chromosomes 8 and 9, were identified using BLAST analysis. Both of them appear to be extracellular glycoproteins. To have a global view of the dynamic gene expression pattern, seven Ospgip genes were first analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array data from online resource. All of these seven Ospgip genes showed variable expression patterns among tissues/organs. In order to further investigate the potential function of these Ospgip genes, the responses of Ospgip genes to the treatment of various phytohormones (abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, gibberellic acid, 3-indole acetic acid, jasmonic acid, kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid and salicylic acid) as well as fungal infection were analyzed by real-time PCR using time course array. Generally, all the Ospgip genes were slightly up-regulated in the indica rice cultivar Minghui 63 under GA(3), KT and NAA treatments (except Ospgip2, which was down-regulated under KT treatment). In the japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, Ospgip genes were regulated by most treatments with the response time variability. We also analyzed putative cis-elements in the promoter regions of Ospgip genes. This dataset provided a versatile resource to understand the regulatory network of Ospgip genes during the process of phytohormones treatment and fungal infection in the model monocotyledonous plant, rice, and could aid in the transgenic breeding against rice fungal diseases.

KEY MESSAGE: All the seven Ospgip genes showed variable expression patterns in Minghui 63 and their expressions were regulated by different phytohormone treatments or fungal infection in Minghui 63 and Zhonghua 11.
22302312	Overexpression of rice CBS domain containing protein improves salinity, oxidative, and heavy metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	We have recently identified and classified a cystathionine β-synthase domain containing protein family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Based on the microarray and MPSS data, we have suggested their involvement in stress tolerance. In this study, we have characterized a rice protein of unknown function, OsCBSX4. This gene was found to be upregulated under high salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stresses at seedling stage. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCBSX4 exhibited improved tolerance toward salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress. This enhanced stress tolerance in transgenic plants could directly be correlated with higher accumulation of OsCBSX4 protein. Transgenic plants could grow and set seeds under continuous presence of 150 mM NaCl. The total seed yield in WT plants was reduced by 80%, while in transgenic plants, it was reduced only by 15-17%. The transgenic plants accumulated less Na+, especially in seeds and maintained higher net photosynthesis rate and Fv/Fm than WT plants under NaCl stress. Transgenic seedlings also accumulated significantly less H2O2 as compared to WT under salinity, heavy metal, and oxidative stress. OsCBSX4 overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit higher abiotic stress tolerance than WT plants suggesting its role in abiotic stress tolerance in plants.
22367482	Reduced tillering in Basmati rice T-DNA insertional mutant OsTEF1 associates with differential expression of stress related genes and transcription factors.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	A T-DNA insertional mutant OsTEF1 of rice gives 60-80% reduced tillering, retarded growth of seminal roots, and sensitivity to salt stress compared to wild type Basmati 370. The insertion occurred in a gene encoding a transcription elongation factor homologous to yeast elf1, on chromosome 2 of rice. Detailed transcriptomic profiling of OsTEF1 revealed that mutation in the transcription elongation factor differentially regulates the expression of more than 100 genes with known function and finely regulates tillering process in rice by inducing the expression of cytochrome P450. Along with different transcription factors, several stress associated genes were also affected due to a single insertion. In silico analysis of the TEF1 protein showed high conservation among different organisms. This transcription elongation factor predicted to interact with other proteins that directly or indirectly positively regulate tillering in rice.
22370743	LOX genes in blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) resistance in rice.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Plant Lipoxygenases (LOX) are known to play major role in plant immunity by providing front-line defense against pathogen-induced injury. To verify this, we isolated a full-length OsLOX3 gene and also 12 OsLOX cDNA clones from Oryza sativa indica (cultivar Pusa Basmati 1). We have examined the role played by LOXs in plant development and during attack by blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Gene expression, promoter region analysis, and biochemical and protein structure analysis of isolated OsLOX3 revealed significant homology with LOX super family. Protein sequence comparison of OsLOXs revealed high levels of homology when compared with japonica rice (up to100%) and Arabidopsis (up to 64%). Isolated LOX3 gene and 12 OsLOX cDNAs contained the catalytic LOX domains much required for oxygen binding and synthesis of oxylipins. Amino acid composition, protein secondary structure, and promoter region analysis (with abundance of motifs CGTCA and TGACG) support the role of OsLOX3 gene in providing resistance to diseases in rice plants. OsLOX3 gene expression analysis of root, shoot, flag leaf, and developing and mature seed revealed organ specific patterns during rice plant development and gave evidence to association between tissue location and physiological roles played by individual OsLOXs. Increased defense activity of oxylipins was observed as demonstrated by PCR amplification of OsLOX3 gene and upon inoculation with virulent strains of M. grisea and ectopic application of methyl jasmonate in the injured leaf tissue in adult rice plants.
22435142	Cloning and characterization of a gene encoding novel zinc finger protein transcription factor induced under water deficit stress from rice (Oryza sativa) cv. N-22.	2012	Indian J Biochem Biophys	A gene OsZnI encoding Cys3/His1-type zinc finger protein was isolated from the water stress-induced cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa) cv. N-22, an early maturing, deep-rooted, drought-tolerant genotype adapted to upland conditions. The in-silico analysis revealed an insert of 800 bp with an ORF of 663 nucleotides, encoding 221 amino acids. OsZnI had three distinct features--nuclear localization signal (NLS) present in Arg152-Arg168, Zn finger domain between 185-193 amino acids and 12 amino acids conserved domain in 71-82 amino acids homologous to LEA motif, and belonged to C-type family of Zn finger protein. OsZnI showed induced expression under water deficit stress.
22367483	Os11Gsk gene from a wild rice, Oryza rufipogon improves yield in rice.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Chromosomal segments from wild rice species Oryza rufipogon, introgressed into an elite indica rice restorer line (KMR3) using molecular markers, resulted in significant increase in yield. Here we report the transcriptome analysis of flag leaves and fully emerged young panicles of one of the high yielding introgression lines IL50-7 in comparison to KMR3. A 66-fold upregulated gene Os11Gsk, which showed no transcript in KMR3 was highly expressed in O. rufipogon and IL50-7. A 5-kb genomic region including Os11Gsk and its flanking regions could be PCR amplified only from IL50-7, O. rufipogon, japonica varieties of rice-Nipponbare and Kitaake but not from the indica varieties, KMR3 and Taichung Native-1. Three sister lines of IL50-7 yielding higher than KMR3 showed presence of Os11Gsk, whereas the gene was absent in three other ILs from the same cross having lower yield than KMR3, indicating an association of the presence of Os11Gsk with high yield. Southern analysis showed additional bands in the genomic DNA of O. rufipogon and IL50-7 with Os11Gsk probe. Genomic sequence analysis of ten highly co-expressed differentially regulated genes revealed that two upregulated genes in IL50-7 were derived from O. rufipogon and most of the downregulated genes were either from KMR3 or common to KMR3, IL50-7, and O. rufipogon. Thus, we show that Os11Gsk is a wild rice-derived gene introduced in KMR3 background and increases yield either by regulating expression of functional genes sharing homology with it or by causing epigenetic modifications in the introgression line.
22321692	Overexpression of OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play an important role in plant stress tolerance. We previously reported that expression of OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 could be enhanced by heat shock treatment and/or other abiotic stresses. In this paper, stress tolerance assays of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 have been carried out. Both OsHsp17.0-OE and OsHsp23.7-OE transgenic lines demonstrated higher germination ability compared to wild-type (WT) plants when subjected to mannitol and NaCl. Phenotypic analysis showed that transgenic rice lines displayed a higher tolerance to drought and salt stress compared to WT plants. In addition, transgenic rice lines showed significantly lower REC, lower MDA content and higher free proline content than WT under drought and salt stresses. These results suggest that OsHsp17.0 and OsHsp23.7 play an important role in rice acclimation to salt and drought stresses and are useful for engineering drought and salt tolerance rice.
10769179	Involvement of NRAMP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana in iron transport.	2000	Biochem J	Nramp genes code for a widely distributed class of proteins involved in a variety of processes, ranging from the control of susceptibility to bacterial infection in mammalian cells and taste behaviour in Drosophila to manganese uptake in yeast. Some of the NRAMP proteins in mammals and in yeast are capable of transporting metal ions, including iron. In plants, iron transport was shown to require a reduction/Fe(II) transport system. In Arabidopsis thaliana this process involves the IRT1 and Fro2 genes. Here we report the sequence of five NRAMP proteins from A. thaliana. Sequence comparison suggests that there are two classes of NRAMP proteins in plants: A. thaliana (At) NRAMP1 and Oriza sativa (Os) NRAMP1 and 3 (two rice isologues) represent one class, and AtNRAMP2-5 and OsNRAMP2 the other. AtNramp1 and OsNramp1 are able to complement the fet3fet4 yeast mutant defective both in low- and high-affinity iron transports, whereas AtNramp2 and OsNramp2 fail to do so. In addition, AtNramp1 transcript, but not AtNramp2 transcript, accumulates in response to iron deficiency in roots but not in leaves. Finally, overexpression of AtNramp1 in transgenic A. thaliana plants leads to an increase in plant resistance to toxic iron concentration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AtNramp1 participates in the control of iron homoeostasis in plants.
16359387	Abscisic acid-activated SNRK2 protein kinases function in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signal transduction by phosphorylating ABA response element-binding factors.	2005	Plant J	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces gene expression via the ABA-response element (ABRE) present in the promoters of ABA-regulated genes. A group of bZIP proteins have been identified as ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) that activate transcription through this cis element. A rice ABF, TRAB1, has been shown to be activated via ABA-dependent phosphorylation. While a large number of signalling factors have been identified that are involved in stomatal regulation by ABA, relatively less is known about the ABA-signalling pathway that leads to gene expression. We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress. Here we show that transient overexpression in cultured cell protoplasts of these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases leads to the activation of an ABRE-regulated promoter, suggesting that these kinases are involved in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signalling. We further show several lines of evidence that these ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases directly phosphorylate TRAB1 in response to ABA. Kinetic analysis of SAPK10 activation and TRAB1 phosphorylation indicated that the latter immediately followed the former. TRAB1 was found to be phosphorylated not only in response to ABA, but also in response to hyperosmotic stress, which was interpreted as the consequence of phosphorylation of TRAB1 by hyperosmotically activated SAPKs. Physical interaction between TRAB1 and SAPK10 in vivo was demonstrated by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, TRAB1 was phosphorylated in vitro by the ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinases at Ser102, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to ABA and is critical for the activation function.
22332708	Crinkly4 receptor-like kinase is required to maintain the interlocking of the palea and lemma, and fertility in rice, by promoting epidermal cell differentiation.	2012	Plant J	The palea and lemma are unique organs in grass plants that form a protective barrier around the floral organs and developing kernel. The interlocking of the palea and lemma is critical for maintaining fertility and seed yield in rice; however, the molecules that control the interlocking structure remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that when OsCR4 mRNA expression was knocked down in rice by RNA interference, the palea and lemma separated at later spikelet stages and gradually turned brown after heading, resulting in the severe interruption of pistil pollination and damage to the development of embryo and endosperm, with defects in aleurone. The irregular architecture of the palea and lemma was caused by tumour-like cell growth in the outer epidermis and wart-like cell masses in the inner epidermis. These abnormal cells showed discontinuous cuticles and uneven cell walls, leading to organ self-fusion that distorted the interlocking structures. Additionally, the faster leakage of chlorophyll, reduced silica content and elevated accumulation of anthocyanin in the palea and lemma indicated a lesion in the protective barrier, which also impaired seed quality. OsCR4 is an active receptor-like kinase associated with the membrane fraction. An analysis of promoter::GUS reporter plants showed that OsCR4 is specifically expressed in the epidermal cells of paleas and lemmas. Together, these results suggest that OsCR4 plays an essential role in maintaining the interlocking of the palea and lemma by promoting epidermal cell differentiation.
22195592	Male-sterile and cleistogamous phenotypes in tall fescue induced by chimeric repressors of SUPERWOMAN1 and OsMADS58.	2012	Plant Sci	Since tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an anemophilous (wind-pollinated) grass species, male sterility is strongly desired for transgenic tall fescue to prevent pollen dispersal. To create male-sterile tall fescue, we applied Chimeric REpressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) based on rice APETALA3 (AP3) and AGAMOUS (AG) orthologues that specify the formation of stamens. We fused the coding regions of rice AP3 orthologue SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1), and rice AG orthologues, Os12g0207000, Os01g0886200 and OsMADS58, respectively with the artificial sequence encoding the modified EAR-like motif repression domain (SRDX). We first introduced Os12g0207000SRDX, Os01g0886200SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX into rice for evaluation of their abilities to induce male sterility. The transgenic rice expressing OsMADS58SRDX had reiterated formation of lodicule-like organs instead of stamens and carpel, a typical phenotype of ag mutant. Thus, we found that OsMADS58SRDX was most suitable for our purpose. Next, we introduced SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX into tall fescue. Although the transgenic tall fescue did not have the stamen alterations seen in SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX rice, they either produced no pollen or produced immature pollen; thus, the anthers were not dehiscent and the plants were male-sterile. In addition to the male sterility, SPW1SRDX tall fescue showed a cleistogamous (closed) phenotype in which anthers were not observed outside the glumes, with thin, abnormally elongated lodicules. Some lines of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue showed a cleistogamous phenotype in which the lodicules were homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs. In both cases, cleistogamous phenotype was associated with morphological changes to the lodicules. We also obtained a mild phenotype of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue, which exhibited only the male sterility. In this study, we produced novel male-sterile phenotypes using chimeric repressors and thus suggest CRES-T as a tool for transgenic improvement of forage and turf grasses.
22353606	A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation.	2012	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: Arabidopsis NPR1 is a master regulator of systemic acquired resistance. NPR1 binds to TGA transcription factors and functions as a transcriptional co-activator. In rice, NH1/OsNPR1 functions to enhance innate immunity. NRR disrupts NH1 function, when over-expressed.

RESULTS: We have established a rice transient protoplast assay to demonstrate that NH1 is a transcriptional co-activator and that NRR represses NH1-mediated activation. We identified three NRR homologues (RH1, RH2, and RH3). RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation. NRR, RH1, RH2, and RH3 share sequence similarity in a region beyond the previously identified NPR1-interacting domain. This region is required for strong interaction with NH1. A double point mutation, W66A/F70A, in this novel NH1-interacting domain severely reduces interaction with NH1. Mutation W66A/F70A also greatly reduces the ability of NRR to repress NH1-mediated activation. RH2 carries a deviation (amino acids AV) in this region as compared to consensus sequences (amino acids ED) among NRR, RH1, and RH3. A substitution (AV to ED) in RH2 results in strong binding of mutant RH2ED to NH1 and effective repression of NH1-mediated activation.

CONCLUSIONS: The protoplast-based transient system can be used to dissect protein domains associated with their functions. Our results demonstrate that the ability of NRR and its homologues to repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation is tightly correlated with their ability to bind to NH1. Furthermore, a sequence is identified as a novel NH1-interacting domain. Importantly, this novel sequence is widely present in plant species, from cereals to castor bean plants, to poplar trees, to Arabidopsis, indicating its significance in plants.
22319054	Somatic and reproductive cell development in rice anther is regulated by a putative glutaredoxin.	2012	Plant Cell	The switch from mitosis to meiosis is one of the most pivotal events in eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the mechanisms orchestrating meiosis initiation remain elusive, particularly in plants. Flowering plants are heterosporous, with male and female spore genesis adopting different developmental courses. We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1). The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility. Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores. Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1. MIL1 encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors. These results suggest meiotic entry in microsporocytes is directed by an anther-specific mechanism, which requires MIL1 activity, and redox regulation might play important roles in this process.
22301384	A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	MYB-type transcription factors play a diverse role in plant development and response to abiotic stress. This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference OsMYB2. Expression of OsMYB2 was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress. OsMYB2 was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity. No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress. Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters. The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated less amounts of H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde. The enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, may underlie the lower H(2)O(2) contents in OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. There was greater up-regulation of stress-related genes, including OsLEA3, OsRab16A, and OsDREB2A, in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. Microarray analysis showed that expression of numerous genes involving diverse functions in stress response was altered in the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants. These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
22451723	Modulation of ethylene responses by OsRTH1 overexpression reveals the biological significance of ethylene in rice seedling growth and development.	2012	J Exp Bot	Overexpression of Arabidopsis Reversion-To-ethylene Sensitivity1 (RTE1) results in whole-plant ethylene insensitivity dependent on the ethylene receptor gene Ethylene Response1 (ETR1). However, overexpression of the tomato RTE1 homologue Green Ripe (GR) delays fruit ripening but does not confer whole-plant ethylene insensitivity. It was decided to investigate whether aspects of ethylene-induced growth and development of the monocotyledonous model plant rice could be modulated by rice RTE1 homologues (OsRTH genes). Results from a cross-species complementation test in Arabidopsis showed that OsRTH1 overexpression complemented the rte1-2 loss-of-function mutation and conferred whole-plant ethylene insensitivity in an ETR1-dependent manner. In contrast, OsRTH2 and OsRTH3 overexpression did not complement rte1-2 or confer ethylene insensitivity. In rice, OsRTH1 overexpression substantially prevented ethylene-induced alterations in growth and development, including leaf senescence, seedling leaf elongation and development, coleoptile elongation or curvature, and adventitious root development. Results of subcellular localizations of OsRTHs, each fused with the green fluorescent protein, in onion epidermal cells suggested that the three OsRTHs were predominantly localized to the Golgi. OsRTH1 may be an RTE1 orthologue of rice and modulate rice ethylene responses. The possible roles of auxins and gibberellins in the ethylene-induced alterations in growth were evaluated and the biological significance of ethylene in the early stage of rice seedling growth is discussed.
22466020	Expression dynamics of metabolic and regulatory components across stages of panicle and seed development in indica rice.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	Carefully analyzed expression profiles can serve as a valuable reference for deciphering gene functions. We exploited the potential of whole genome microarrays to measure the spatial and temporal expression profiles of rice genes in 19 stages of vegetative and reproductive development. We could verify expression of 22,980 genes in at least one of the tissues. Differential expression analysis with respect to five vegetative tissues and preceding stages of development revealed reproductive stage-preferential/-specific genes. By using subtractive logic, we identified 354 and 456 genes expressing specifically during panicle and seed development, respectively. The metabolic/hormonal pathways and transcription factor families playing key role in reproductive development were elucidated after overlaying the expression data on the public databases and manually curated list of transcription factors, respectively. During floral meristem differentiation (P1) and male meiosis (P3), the genes involved in jasmonic acid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated. P6 stage of panicle, containing mature gametophytes, exhibited enrichment of transcripts involved in homogalacturonon degradation. Genes regulating auxin biosynthesis were induced during early seed development. We validated the stage-specificity of regulatory regions of three panicle-specific genes, OsAGO3, OsSub42, and RTS, and an early seed-specific gene, XYH, in transgenic rice. The data generated here provides a snapshot of the underlying complexity of the gene networks regulating rice reproductive development.
22380881	Targeted disruption of an orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 2, OsDRM2, impairs the growth of rice plants by abnormal DNA methylation.	2012	Plant J	Recent methylome analyses of the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome using various mutants have provided detailed information about the DNA methylation pattern and its function. However, information about DNA methylation in other plants is limited, partly because of the lack of mutants. To study DNA methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) we applied homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting to generate targeted disruptants of OsDRM2, a rice orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/2), which encode DNA methyltransferases responsible for de novo and non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis. Whereas Arabidopsis drm1 drm2 double mutants showed no morphological alterations, targeted disruptants of rice OsDRM2 displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes in both vegetative and reproductive stages, including growth defects, semi-dwarfed stature, reductions in tiller number, delayed heading or no heading, abnormal panicle and spikelet morphology, and complete sterility. In these osdrm2 disruptants, a 13.9% decrease in 5-methylcytosine was observed by HPLC analysis. The CG and non-CG methylation levels were reduced in RIRE7/CRR1 retrotransposons, and in 5S rDNA repeats. Associated transcriptional activation was detected in RIRE7/CRR1. Furthermore, de novo methylation by an RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) process involving transgene-derived exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) was deficient in osdrm2-disrupted cells. Impaired growth and abnormal DNA methylation of osdrm2 disruptants were restored by the complementation of wild-type OsDRM2 cDNA. Our results suggest that OsDRM2 is responsible for de novo, CG and non-CG methylation in rice genomic sequences, and that DNA methylation regulated by OsDRM2 is essential for proper rice development in both vegetative and reproductive stages.
22428987	Heat shock-induced biphasic Ca(2+) signature and OsCaM1-1 nuclear localization mediate downstream signalling in acquisition of thermotolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Cell Environ	We investigated heat shock (HS)-triggered Ca(2+) signalling transduced by a Ca(2+) sensor, calmodulin (CaM), linked to early transcriptome changes of HS-responsive genes in rice. We observed a biphasic [Ca(2+) ](cyt) signature in root cells that was distinct from that in epicotyl and leaf cells, which showed a monophasic response after HS. Treatment with Ca(2+) and A23187 generated an intense and sustained increase in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) in response to HS. Conversely, treatment with Ca(2+) chelator, L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker and CaM antagonist, but not intracellular Ca(2+) release inhibitor, strongly inhibited the increased [Ca(2+) ](cyt) . HS combined with Ca(2+) and A23187 accelerated the expression of OsCaM1-1 and sHSPC/N genes, which suggests that the HS-induced apoplastic Ca(2+) influx is responsible for the [Ca(2+) ](cyt) response and downstream HS signalling. In addition, the biphasic response of OsCaM1-1 in the nucleus followed the Ca(2+) signature, which may provide the information necessary to direct HS-related gene expression. Overexpression of OsCaM1-1 induced the expression of Ca(2+) /HS-related AtCBK3, AtPP7, AtHSF and AtHSP at a non-inducing temperature and enhanced intrinsic thermotolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis. Therefore, HS-triggered rapid increases in [Ca(2+) ](cyt) , together with OsCaM1-1 expression and its nuclear localization, are important in mediating downstream HS-related gene expression for the acquisition of thermotolerance in rice.
22434193	Degradation of MONOCULM 1 by APC/C(TAD1) regulates rice tillering.	2012	Nat Commun	A rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that contributes greatly to grain yield. The MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) gene is the first identified key regulator controlling rice tiller number; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report a novel rice gene, Tillering and Dwarf 1 (TAD1), which encodes a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), a multi-subunit E3 ligase. Although the elucidation of co-activators and individual subunits of plant APC/C involved in regulating plant development have emerged recently, the understanding of whether and how this large cell-cycle machinery controls plant development is still very limited. Our study demonstrates that TAD1 interacts with MOC1, forms a complex with OsAPC10 and functions as a co-activator of APC/C to target MOC1 for degradation in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Our findings uncovered a new mechanism underlying shoot branching and shed light on the understanding of how the cell-cycle machinery regulates plant architecture.
22408075	SHAT1, A new player in seed shattering of rice.	2012	Plant Cell	
22442415	The rice ERF transcription factor OsERF922 negatively regulates resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and salt tolerance.	2012	J Exp Bot	Rice OsERF922, encoding an APETELA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) type transcription factor, is rapidly and strongly induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and salt treatments, as well as by both virulent and avirulent pathovars of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. OsERF922 is localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the GCC box sequence, and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells. Knockdown of OsERF922 by means of RNAi enhanced resistance against M. oryzae. The elevated disease resistance of the RNAi plants was associated with increased expression of PR, PAL, and the other genes encoding phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes and without M. oryzae infection. In contrast, OsERF922-overexpressing plants showed reduced expression of these defence-related genes and enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. In addition, the OsERF922-overexpressing lines exhibited decreased tolerance to salt stress with an increased Na(+)/K(+) ratio in the shoots. The ABA levels were found increased in the overexpressing lines and decreased in the RNAi plants. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis-related genes, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) 3 and 4, was upregulated in the OsERF922-overexpressing plants, and NCED4 was downregulated in the RNAi lines. These results suggest that OsERF922 is integrated into the cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress-signalling networks perhaps through modulation of the ABA levels.
22248149	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice.	2012	Biochem J	MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways have been implicated in stress signalling in plants. In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify partner MAPKs for OsMKK (Oryza sativa MAPK kinase) 6, a rice MAPK kinase, and revealed specific interactions of OsMKK6 with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 each co-immunoprecipitated OsMKK6, and both were directly phosphorylated by OsMKK6 in vitro. An MBP (myelin basic protein) kinase assay of the immunoprecipitation complex indicated that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were activated in response to a moderately low temperature (12°C), but not a severely low temperature (4°C) in rice seedlings. A constitutively active form of OsMKK6, OsMKK6DD, showed elevated phosphorylation activity against OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro. OsMPK3, but not OsMPK6, was constitutively activated in transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD, indicating that OsMPK3 is an in vivo target of OsMKK6. Enhanced chilling tolerance was observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD. Taken together, our data suggest that OsMKK6 and OsMPK3 constitute a moderately low-temperature signalling pathway and regulate cold stress tolerance in rice.
22422982	The path from β-carotene to carlactone, a strigolactone-like plant hormone.	2012	Science	Strigolactones, phytohormones with diverse signaling activities, have a common structure consisting of two lactones connected by an enol-ether bridge. Strigolactones derive from carotenoids via a pathway involving the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 7 and 8 (CCD7 and CCD8) and the iron-binding protein D27. We show that D27 is a β-carotene isomerase that converts all-trans-β-carotene into 9-cis-β-carotene, which is cleaved by CCD7 into a 9-cis-configured aldehyde. CCD8 incorporates three oxygens into 9-cis-β-apo-10'-carotenal and performs molecular rearrangement, linking carotenoids with strigolactones and producing carlactone, a compound with strigolactone-like biological activities. Knowledge of the structure of carlactone will be crucial for understanding the biology of strigolactones and may have applications in combating parasitic weeds.
22445891	Expression of OsSPY and 14-3-3 genes involved in plant height variations of ion-beam-induced KDML 105 rice mutants.	2012	Mutat Res	The culm length of two semidwarf rice mutants (PKOS1, HyKOS1) obtained from low-energy N-ion beam bombardments of dehusked Thai jasmine rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. KDML 105) seeds showed 25.7% and 21.5% height reductions and one spindly rice mutant (TKOS4) showed 21.4% increase in comparison with that of the KDML 105 control. A cDNA-RAPD analysis identified differential gene expression in internode tissues of the rice mutants. Two genes identified from the cDNA-RAPD were OsSPY and 14-3-3, possibly associated with stem height variations of the semidwarf and spindly mutants, respectively. The OsSPY gene encoded the SPY protein which is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA). On the other hand, the 14-3-3 encoded a signaling protein which can bind and prevent the RSG (repression of shoot growth) protein function as a transcriptional repressor of the kaurene oxidase (KO) gene in the GA biosynthetic pathway. Expression analysis of OsSPY, 14-3-3, RSG, KO, and SLR1 was confirmed in rice internode tissues during the reproductive stage of the plants by semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. The expression analysis showed a clear increase of the levels of OsSPY transcripts in PKOS1 and HyKOS1 tissue samples compared to that of the KDML 105 and TKOS4 samples at the age of 50-60 days which were at the ages of internode elongation. The 14-3-3 expression had the highest increase in the TKOS4 samples compared to those in KDML 105, PKOS1 and HyKOS1 samples. The expression analysis of RSG and KO showed an increase in TKOS4 samples compared to that of the KDML 105 and that of the two semidwarf mutants. These results indicate that changes of OsSPY and 14-3-3 expression could affect internode elongation and cause the phenotypic changes of semidwarf and spindly rice mutants, respectively.
22493492	Purification and identification of naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase, a key enzyme in biosynthesis of flavonoid phytoalexin sakuranetin in rice.	2012	J Biol Chem	Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, is induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, CuCl(2) treatment, jasmonic acid treatment, and infection by phytopathogens. It was recently demonstrated that sakuranetin has anti-inflammatory activity, anti-mutagenic activity, anti-pathogenic activities against Helicobacter pylori, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma and contributes to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in animals. Thus, sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT). In previous research, rice NOMT (OsNOMT) was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves, but the purified protein, named OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity and not NOMT activity. In this study, we found that OsCOMT1 does not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo, and we purified OsNOMT using the oscomt1 mutant. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps, resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation. Using SDS-PAGE, the purest enzyme preparation showed a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. Two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, encoded by Os04g0175900 and Os12g0240900, were identified from the 40-kDa band by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Recombinant Os12g0240900 protein showed NOMT activity, but the recombinant Os04g0175900 protein did not. Os12g0240900 expression was induced by jasmonic acid treatment in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the Os12g0240900 protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to OsNOMT. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Os12g0240900 encodes an OsNOMT.
22486829	Vacuolar degradation of two integral plasma membrane proteins, AtLRR84A and OsSCAMP1, is cargo ubiquitination-independent and prevacuolar compartment-mediated in plant cells.	2012	Traffic	In plant cells, how integral plasma membrane (PM) proteins are degraded in a cargo ubiquitination-independent manner remains elusive. Here, we studied the degradative pathway of two plant PM proteins: AtLRR84A, a type I integral membrane protein belonging to the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase protein family, and OsSCAMP1 (rice secretory carrier membrane protein 1), a tetraspan transmembrane protein located on the PM and trans-Golgi network (TGN) or early endosome (EE). Using wortmannin and ARA7(Q69L) mutant that could enlarge the multivesicular body (MVB) or prevacuolar compartment (PVC) as tools, we demonstrated that, when expressed as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco BY-2 or Arabidopsis protoplasts, both AtLRR84A and OsSCAMP1 were degraded in the lytic vacuole via the internal vesicles of MVB/PVC in a cargo ubiquitination-independent manner. Such MVB/PVC-mediated vacuolar degradation of PM proteins was further supported by immunocytochemical electron microscopy (immunoEM) study showing the labeling of the fusions on the internal vesicles of the PVC/MVB. Thus, cargo ubiquitination-independent and PVC-mediated degradation of PM proteins in the vacuole is functionally operated in plant cells.
22507309	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.	2012	Plant J	COM1/SAE2 is a highly conserved gene from yeast to higher eukaryotes. Its orthologs, known to cooperate with the MRX complex (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2), are required for meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends resection and specific mitotic DSB repair events. Here, the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n = 2x = 24) COM1/SAE2 homolog was identified through positional cloning, termed OsCOM1. Four independent mutants of OsCOM1 were isolated and characterized. In Oscom1 mutants, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination were severely inhibited, whereas aberrant non-homologous chromosome entanglements occurred constantly. Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal. Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants. These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.
22505428	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of OsAREB8 from rice, a member of the AREB/ABF family of bZIP transcription factors, in complex with its cognate DNA.	2012	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	The AREB/ABF family of bZIP transcription factors play a key role in drought stress response and tolerance during the vegetative stage in plants. To reveal the DNA-recognition mechanism of the AREB/ABF family of proteins, the bZIP domain of OsAREB8, an AREB/ABF-family protein from Oryza sativa, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized with its cognate DNA. Crystals of the OsAREB8-DNA complex were obtained by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 277 K with a reservoir solution consisting of 50 mM MES pH 6.4, 29% MPD, 2 mM spermidine, 20 mM magnesium acetate and 100 mM sodium chloride. A crystal diffracted X-rays to 3.65 Å resolution and belonged to space group C222, with unit-cell parameters a = 155.1, b = 206.7, c = 38.5 Å. The crystal contained one OsAREB8-DNA complex in the asymmetric unit.
22465006	A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Proteins containing hemopexin fold domain are suggested to have diverse functions in various living organisms. In order to investigate the structure and function of this type of protein in rice plant (Oryza sativa), the gene encoding a hemopexin fold protein (OsHFP) was cloned, analyzed in silico and characterized. Molecular modeling revealed that the OsHFP is closely related to other hemopexin fold proteins, but is unique with a cylindrical central tunnel as well as extended N- and C-terminal domains. The recombinant OsHFP was found to bind hemin, the oxidized form of heme in vitro. The expression of the single copy OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds. Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue. The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed.
22427359	Albumin from rice: why and wherefore?	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	
22429805	Genomic survey, expression profile and co-expression network analysis of OsWD40 family in rice.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: WD40 proteins represent a large family in eukaryotes, which have been involved in a broad spectrum of crucial functions. Systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of OsWD40 genes enable us to understand the networks of the WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, we identify and analyze 200 potential OsWD40 genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member. Expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of OsWD40 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Under phytohormone treatments, 25 OsWD40 genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone NAA, KT, or GA3 in rice seedlings. We also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and Gene Ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the OsWD40 genes in rice. The results suggested that OsWD40 genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways. The analysis also revealed that OsWD40 genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network.

CONCLUSIONS: All of these analyses suggest that the functions of OsWD40 genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
22395576	OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	An R2R3 MYB transcription factor, OsMYB2P-1, was identified from microarray data by monitoring the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seedlings exposed to phosphate (Pi)-deficient medium. Expression of OsMYB2P-1 was induced by Pi starvation. OsMYB2P-1 was localized in the nuclei and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, while suppression of OsMYB2P-1 by RNA interference in rice rendered the transgenic rice more sensitive to Pi deficiency. Furthermore, primary roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were shorter than those in wild-type plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, while primary roots and adventitious roots of OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants were longer than those of wild-type plants under Pi-deficient conditions. These results suggest that OsMYB2P-1 may also be associated with the regulation of root system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j. In contrast, overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 suppressed the expression of OsPHO2 under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters. These findings demonstrate that OsMYB2P-1 is a novel R2R3 MYB transcriptional factor associated with Pi starvation signaling in rice.
22383541	Characterization of genes involved in cytokinin signaling and metabolism from rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Two-component signaling elements play important roles in plants, including a central role in cytokinin signaling. We characterized two-component elements from the monocot rice (Oryza sativa) using several complementary approaches. Phylogenetic analysis reveals relatively simple orthologous relationships among the histidine kinases in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In contrast, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (OsHPs) and response regulators (OsRRs) display a higher degree of lineage-specific expansion. The intracellular localizations of several OsHPs and OsRRs were examined in rice and generally found to correspond to the localizations of their dicot counterparts. The functionality of rice type-B OsRRs was tested in Arabidopsis; one from a clade composed of both monocot and dicot type-B OsRRs complemented an Arabidopsis type-B response regulator mutant, but a type-B OsRR from a monocot-specific subfamily generally did not. The expression of genes encoding two-component elements and proteins involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation was analyzed in rice roots and shoots and in response to phytohormones. Nearly all type-A OsRRs and OsHK4 were up-regulated in response to cytokinin, but other cytokinin signaling elements were not appreciably affected. Furthermore, multiple cytokinin oxidase (OsCKX) genes were up-regulated by cytokinin. Abscisic acid treatment decreased the expression of several genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation. Auxin affected the expression of a few genes; brassinosteroid and gibberellin had only modest effects. Our results support a shared role for two-component elements in mediating cytokinin signaling in monocots and dicots and reveal how phytohormones can impact cytokinin function through modulating gene expression.
22451926	CHD3 protein recognizes and regulates methylated histone H3 lysines 4 and 27 over a subset of targets in the rice genome.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Histone lysine methylation is an important component of the epigenetic system demarcating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains. It is of primary importance in understanding how different histone lysine methylation marks and a specific combination of them are read and interpreted by chromatin proteins to regulate gene expression. In this paper, we report that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 that was required for many aspects of plant development can interact with dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2, a mark associated with moderately expressed or repressed genes) and with trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3, a mark associated with repressed genes), respectively, through the chromodomains and the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of the protein. A mutation or down-regulation of the gene provoked a decrease of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (a mark associated with active genes). Genome-wide analysis revealed that H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, respectively, were lost from about 56 and 23% of marked loci, which correspond mostly to under-expressed or repressed genes. In the mutant, a higher-than-expected proportion of down-regulated genes lost H3K4me3, among which many encode DNA-binding transcription factors. These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein is a bifunctional chromatin regulator able to recognize and modulate H3K4 and H3K27 methylation over repressed or tissue-specific genes, which may be associated with regulation of a gene transcription program of plant development.
22437844	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The Rac/Rop GTPase OsRac1 plays an essential role in rice immunity. However, the regulatory genes acting downstream of OsRac1 are largely unknown. We focused on the RAI1 gene, which is up-regulated in suspension cells expressing a constitutively active form of OsRac1. RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. A microarray analysis of cells transformed with an inducible RAI1 construct showed increased expression of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes after induction, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RAI1. This was confirmed using RAI1 T-DNA activation-tagged and RNA interference lines. The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus. These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice. RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro. Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts. Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that OsMAPK3 and OsRac1 occur in the same complex as OsMAPK6. Taken together, our results indicate that RAI1 could be regulated by OsRac1 through an OsMAPK3/6 cascade. In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1. This work will help us to understand the immune system regulated by OsRac1 in rice and its orthologs in other plant species.
22499210	OsTRXh1 regulates the redox state of the apoplast and influences stress responses in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The plant cell apoplast is the compartment beyond the cell plasmalemma, including the cell wall and intercellular space. Many environmental elements can trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst at the plasma membrane which then alters the redox state of the apoplast. Recently, h-type thioredoxin (Trx), OsTRXh1, was identified to be involved in apoplastic redox state regulation in rice. OsTRXh1 is conserved redox-active Trx and can be secreted into the extracellular regions. Through transgenic rice plant, we found that OsTRXh1 regulated ROS accumulation in apoplast and influenced plant development and stress responses. This provides new insights into apoplastic redox state regulation pathway and expands our understanding of h-type Trxs function.

21757254	Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice.	2011	J Plant Physiol	S-Adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase (SAMS) [EC 2.5.1.6] catalyzes to produce SAM (S-adenosyl-l-methionine), a universal methyl group donor in biochemical reactions in cells. However, less is known how SAMS controls plant development. Here, we demonstrate that OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 are essential for histone H3K4me3 and DNA methylation to regulate gene expression related to flowering in Oryza sativa. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice with downregulated transcripts of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfism, reduced fertility, delayed germination, as well as late flowering. Delayed germination was largely rescued by application of SAM in the knockdown lines. Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes). Moreover, the histone H3K4me3 and symmetric DNA methylation at these genes were greatly reduced. Thus, SAM deficiency suppressing DNA and H3K4me3 transmethylations at flowering key genes led to a late-flowering phenotype in rice. This information could help elucidate the mechanism of epigenetic control flowering transition.
21828106	RSOsPR10 expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant roots play important roles not only in the absorption of water and nutrients, but also in stress tolerance. Previously, we identified RSOsPR10 as a root-specific pathogenesis-related (PR) protein induced by drought and salt treatments in rice. Transcripts and proteins of RSOsPR10 were strongly induced by jasmonate (JA) and the ethylene (ET) precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), while salicylic acid (SA) almost completely suppressed these inductions. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that RSOsPR10 strongly accumulated in cortex cells surrounding the vascular system of roots, and this accumulation was also suppressed when SA was applied simultaneously with stress or hormone treatments. In the JA-deficient mutant hebiba, RSOsPR10 expression was up-regulated by NaCl, wounding, drought and exogenous application of JA. This suggested the involvement of a signal transduction pathway that integrates JA and ET signals in plant defense responses. Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of RSOsPR10 after salt, JA and ACC treatments. Simultaneous SA treatment strongly inhibited the induction of RSOsPR10 expression and, to a lesser extent, induction of OsERF1 expression. These results suggest that JA/ET and SA pathways function in the stress-responsive induction of RSOsPR10, and that OsERF1 may be one of the transcriptional factors in the JA/ET pathway.
21823826	Polymorphisms and evolutionary history of retrotransposon insertions in rice promoters.	2011	Genome	Retrotransposons are ubiquitous in higher plant genomes. The presence or absence of retrotransposons in whole genome and high throughput genomic sequence (HTGS) from cultivated and wild rice was investigated to understand the organization and evolution of retrotransposon insertions in promoter regions. Approximately half of the Oryza sativa subsp. japonica 'Nipponbare' promoters with retrotransposons conserved in Oryza sativa subsp. indica '93-11' and four wild rice species showed higher sequence conservation in retrotransposon than nonretrotransposon regions. We further investigated, in detail, the evolutionary dynamics of five retrotransposons in the promoter regions of 95 rice genotypes. Our data suggest that four of five insertions (Rp2-Rp5) occurred in the ancestor of AA genome, while the other insertion (Rp1) predates the ancestral divergence of Oryza officinalis (CC genome). Four retrotransposons (Rp2-Rp5) were present in 52% (Rp2), 29% (Rp3), 53% (Rp4), and 43% (Rp5) of the rice genotypes with AA genome type, and the fifth retrotransposon (Rp1) was present in 95% of the rice genotypes with AA, BBCC, or CC genome types. Furthermore, most of these retrotransposons were found to evolve slower than flanking promoter regions, suggesting a role in promoter function for regulating downstream genes.
21757998	Membrane localisation diversity of TPK channels and their physiological role.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Potassium (K) is one of the major nutrients that is essential for plant growth and development. The majority of cellular K+ resides in the vacuole and tonoplast K+ channels of the TPK (Two Pore K) family are main players in cellular K+ homeostasis. All TPK channels were previously reported to be expressed in the tonoplast of the large central lytic vacuole (LV) except for one isoform in Arabidopsis that resides in the plasma membrane. However, plant cells often contain more than one type of vacuole that coexist in the same cell. We recently showed that two TPK isoforms (OsTPKa and OsTPKb) from Oryza sativa localise to different vacuoles with OsTPKa predominantly found in the LV tonoplast and OsTPKb primarily in smaller compartments that resemble small vacuoles (SVs). Our study further revealed that it is the C-terminal domain that determines differential targeting of OsTPKa and OsTPKb. Three C-terminal amino acids were particularly relevant for targeting TPKs to their respective endomembranes. In this addendum we further evaluate how the different localisation of TPKa and TPKb impact on their physiological role and how TPKs provide a potential tool to study the physiology of different types of vacuole.
21854687	Isolation and identification of an AP2/ERF factor that binds an allelic cis-element of rice gene LRK6.	2011	Genet Res (Camb)	Allelic expression of the rice yield-related gene, leucine-rich receptor-like kinase 6 (LRK6), in the hybrid of 93-11 (Oryza sativa L. subsp. Indica var. 93-11) and Nipponbare (O. sativa L. subsp. Japonica var. Nipponbare) is determined by allelic promoter cis-elements. Using deletion analysis of the LRK6 promoter, we identified two distinct regions that might contribute to LRK6 expression. Sequence alignment revealed differences in these LRK6 promoter regions in 93-11 and Nipponbare. One of the segments, named differential sequence of LRK6 promoter 2 (DSLP2), contains potential transcription factor binding sites. Using a yeast one-hybrid assay, we isolated an ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) protein that binds to DSLP2. Sequence analysis and a GCC-box assay showed that the ERF gene, O. sativa ERF 3 (OsERF3), which belongs to ERF subfamily class II, has a conserved ERF domain and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression repressor motif. We used an in vivo mutation assay to identify a new motif (5'-TAA(A)GT-3') located in DSLP2, which interacts with OsERF3. These results suggest that OsERF3, an AP2 (APETALA 2 Gene)/ERF transcription factor, binds the LRK6 promoter at this new motif, which might cause differential expression of LRK6 in the 93-11/Nipponbare hybrid.
18315545	Characterization of a sub-family of Arabidopsis genes with the SPX domain reveals their diverse functions in plant tolerance to phosphorus starvation.	2008	Plant J	Four genes of Arabidopsis (At5g20150, At2g26660, At2g45130 and At5g15330) encoding no conservative region other than an SPX domain (SYG1, Pho81 and XPR1) were named AtSPX1-AtSPX4. The various subcellular localizations of their GFP fusion proteins implied function variations for the four genes. Phosphate starvation strongly induced expression of AtSPX1 and AtSPX3 with distinct dynamic patterns, while AtSPX2 was weakly induced and AtSPX4 was suppressed. Expression of the four AtSPX genes was reduced to different extents in the Arabidopsis phr1 and siz1 mutants under phosphate starvation, indicating that they are part of the phosphate-signaling network that involves SIZ1/PHR1. Over-expression of AtSPX1 increased the transcript levels of ACP5, RNS1 and PAP2 under both phosphate-sufficient and phosphate-deficient conditions, suggesting a potential transcriptional regulation role of AtSPX1 in response to phosphate starvation. Partial repression of AtSPX3 by RNA interference led to aggravated phosphate-deficiency symptoms, altered P allocation and enhanced expression of a subset od phosphate-responsive genes including AtSPX1. Our results indicate that both AtSPX1 and AtSPX3 play positive roles in plant adaptation to phosphate starvation, and AtSPX3 may have a negative feedback regulatory role in AtSPX1 response to phosphate starvation.
19420327	Oil bodies and oleosins in Physcomitrella possess characteristics representative of early trends in evolution.	2009	Plant Physiol	Searches of sequenced genomes of diverse organisms revealed that the moss Physcomitrella patens is the most primitive organism possessing oleosin genes. Microscopy examination of Physcomitrella revealed that oil bodies (OBs) were abundant in the photosynthetic vegetative gametophyte and the reproductive spore. Chromatography illustrated the neutral lipids in OBs isolated from the gametophyte to be largely steryl esters and triacylglycerols, and SDS-PAGE showed the major proteins to be oleosins. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed the expression of all three oleosin genes to be tissue specific. This tissue specificity was greatly altered via alternative splicing, a control mechanism of oleosin gene expression unknown in higher plants. During the production of sex organs at the tips of gametophyte branches, the number of OBs in the top gametophyte tissue decreased concomitant with increases in the number of peroxisomes and level of transcripts encoding the glyoxylate cycle enzymes; thus, the OBs are food reserves for gluconeogenesis. In spores during germination, peroxisomes adjacent to OBs, along with transcripts encoding the glyoxylate cycle enzymes, appeared; thus, the spore OBs are food reserves for gluconeogenesis and equivalent to seed OBs. The one-cell-layer gametophyte could be observed easily with confocal microscopy for the subcellular OBs and other structures. Transient expression of various gene constructs transformed into gametophyte cells revealed that all OBs were linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), that oleosins were synthesized in extended regions of the ER, and that two different oleosins were colocated in all OBs.
22106097	Nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation are integral to hydrogen peroxide-induced leaf cell death in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Nitric oxide (NO) is a key redox-active, small molecule involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. Here, we report the identification of an NO accumulation mutant, nitric oxide excess1 (noe1), in rice (Oryza sativa), the isolation of the corresponding gene, and the analysis of its role in NO-mediated leaf cell death. Map-based cloning revealed that NOE1 encoded a rice catalase, OsCATC. Furthermore, noe1 resulted in an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves, which consequently promoted NO production via the activation of nitrate reductase. The removal of excess NO reduced cell death in both leaves and suspension cultures derived from noe1 plants, implicating NO as an important endogenous mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death. Reduction of intracellular S-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels, generated by overexpression of rice S-nitrosoglutathione reductase gene (GSNOR1), which regulates global levels of protein S-nitrosylation, alleviated leaf cell death in noe1 plants. Thus, S-nitrosylation was also involved in light-dependent leaf cell death in noe1. Utilizing the biotin-switch assay, nanoliquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry, S-nitrosylated proteins were identified in both wild-type and noe1 plants. NO targets identified only in noe1 plants included glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin, which have been reported to be involved in S-nitrosylation-regulated cell death in animals. Collectively, our data suggest that both NO and SNOs are important mediators in the process of H(2)O(2)-induced leaf cell death in rice.
22057934	Bacterial expression, purification and characterization of a rice voltage-dependent, anion-selective channel isoform, OsVDAC4.	2011	J Membr Biol	The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) is the most abundant protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane and forms the major conduit for metabolite transport across this membrane. VDACs from different sources show varied primary sequence but conserved functional properties. Here, we report on the characterization of a rice channel, OsVDAC4, which complements a VDAC1 deficiency in yeast. We present a consensus secondary structure prediction of an N-terminal α-helix and 19 β-strands. Bacterially expressed OsVDAC4 was purified from inclusion bodies into detergent-containing solution, where it is largely helical. Detergent-solubilized OsVDAC4 inserts spontaneously into artificial membranes of two topologies-spherical liposomes and planar bilayers. Insertion into liposomes results in an increase in β-structure. Transport of polyethylene glycols was used to estimate a pore diameter of ~2.6 nm in liposomes. Channels formed in planar bilayers exhibit large conductance (4.6 ± 0.3 nS in 1 M KCl), strong voltage dependence and weak anion selectivity. The open state of the channel is shown to be permeable to ATP. These data are consistent with a large β-barrel pore formed by OsVDAC4 on inserting into membranes. This study forms a platform to carry out studies of the interaction of OsVDAC4 with putative modulators.
22067990	OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation has been well demonstrated as a key regulatory mechanism in response to drought stress in Arabidopsis. However, the biological function of most E3 ligase genes in drought response is still unknown in rice. We recently showed that OsDIS1 (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice. OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice. Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice. Based on these results, we propose a working model for the function of OsDIS1 in regulating the stress signaling pathway in rice.
22120082	[Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (OsKNOLLE) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress].	2011	Yi Chuan	Syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE, a multifunctional protein family belonging to the SNARE superfamily, plays an important role in many physiological processes in plants. In order to understand the function of the syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE (OsKNOLLE) in rice (Oryza sativa), the CDS sequence of OsKNOLLE gene isolated from a japonica rice cultivar "Zhonghua 11" was fused into an expression vector pYX212 and transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method. The transformants with OsKNOLLE showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+. These data suggests that OsKNOLLE plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses. This experimental system sets up a method for studying functions of the OsKNOLLE gene in the future and clarifies the relationship between OsKNOLLE and abiotic stresses.
17886359	Members of the plant NIMA-related kinases are involved in organ development and vascularization in poplar, Arabidopsis and rice.	2007	Plant J	NIMA-related kinases (Neks) are a family of serine/threonine kinases that have been linked to cell-cycle regulation in fungi and mammals. Information regarding the function of Neks in plants is very limited. We screened the three plant species that have had their genomes sequenced in an attempt to improve our understanding of their role in plants. We retrieved seven members in Arabidopsis thaliana, nine in Populus trichocarpa and six in Oryza sativa. Phylogenetic analysis showed that plant Neks are closely related to each other and contain paralogous genes. Moreover, their chromosome distribution and their exon-intron structure revealed that the actual plant Nek family was derived from a single representative followed by large segmental duplication events. Functional expression analyses in the three species relied on RTqPCR in poplar and publicly available microarray data for Arabidopsis and rice. Although plant Neks are present in every organ analyzed, their expression profiles suggest their involvement in plant development processes. Furthermore, we showed that PNek1, a member of the poplar family, is expressed at sites of free auxin synthesis and is specifically involved during the vascularization process.
14675437	Overexpression of the rice Osmyb4 gene increases chilling and freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana plants.	2004	Plant J	The expression of the gene Osmyb4, detected at low level in rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles grown for 3 days at 29 degrees C, is strongly induced by treatments at 4 degrees C. At sublethal temperatures of 10 and 15 degrees C, its expression in rice seedlings is already evident, but this effect cannot be vicariated by other stresses or ABA treatment. We demonstrate by transient expression that Myb4 transactivates the PAL2, ScD9 SAD and COR15a cold-inducible promoters. The Osmyb4 function in vivo is demonstrated overexpressing its cDNA in Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Wassilewskija) under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Myb4 overexpressing plants show a significant increased cold and freezing tolerance, measured as membrane or Photosystem II (PSII) stability and as whole plant tolerance. Finally, in Osmyb4 transgenic plants, the expression of genes participating in different cold-induced pathways is affected, suggesting that Myb4 represents a master switch in cold tolerance.
19017109	Trehalose biosynthesis in response to abiotic stresses.	2008	J Integr Plant Biol	Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide that is present in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria and fungi to invertebrates, in which it serves as an energy source, osmolyte or protein/membrane protectant. The occurrence of trehalose and trehalose biosynthesis pathway in plants has been discovered recently. Multiple studies have revealed regulatory roles of trehalose-6-phosphate, a precursor of trehalose, in sugar metabolism, growth and development in plants. Trehalose levels are generally quite low in plants but may alter in response to environmental stresses. Transgenic plants overexpressing microbial trehalose biosynthesis genes have been shown to contain increased levels of trehalose and display drought, salt and cold tolerance. In-silico expression profiling of all Arabidopsis trehalose-6-phosphate synthases (TPSs) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases (TPPs) revealed that certain classes of TPS and TPP genes are differentially regulated in response to a variety of abiotic stresses. These studies point to the importance of trehalose biosynthesis in stress responses.
7766875	Expression of functional proteins of cDNA encoding rice nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) in Escherichia coli and organ-related alteration of NDK activities during rice seed germination (Oryza sativa L.).	1995	Plant Mol Biol	The GST (glutathione S-transferase)-NDK (nucleoside diphosphate kinase) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The GST-NDK protein was capable of transferring gamma-phosphate from ATP to nucleoside diphosphates such as GDP, CDP, TDP and UDP. Western blot analysis using anti-NDK antibody indicated that NDK in endosperm gradually decreased during 36 h of imbibition. On the contrary, NDK in embryo increased during the same period. NDK activities in both tissues were in accord with these observations. Whereas the NDK protein in roots of rice seedlings during 7 days of imbibition remained constant, in shoots it declined after 5 days of imbibition. Thus, NDK may play a significant role in the cellular event modulated by adenylate energy charge level.
15890279	Crystal structure of nucleoside diphosphate kinase required for coleoptile elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	J Struct Biol	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) is a ubiquitous enzyme found in all organisms and cell types, and catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate. The enzyme is involved in and required for coleoptile elongation in rice as the level of the rice NDK (rNDK) changes during seed germination and the early stages of seedling growth. The expression of rice NDK gene is up-regulated in the growing coleoptiles when the anaerobic stress persists. The rNDK structure determined at 2.5 A resolution consists of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, of which the surfaces are partially covered with six alpha-helices; its overall and active site structures are similar to those of homologous enzymes except the major conformation variations of residue 132-138 regions, involving significant structural contacts. The model contains 148 residues of 149 residues in total and averaged 19 water molecules per monomer for 12 molecules in an asymmetric unit. A mold of 12 superimposed molecules shows that the alphaA-alpha2 area has greater variations and higher temperature factors, indicating the flexibility for a substrate entrance. Hexameric molecular packing in both crystal and solution implies that rNDK functions as hexamers. This rNDK structure, which is the first NDK structure from a higher plant system, provides the structural information essential to understand the functional significance of this enzyme during growth and development in both rice and other plants.
10677437	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase required for coleoptile elongation in rice.	2000	Plant Physiol	Although several nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase genes have been cloned in plants, little is known about the functional significance of this enzyme during plant growth and development. We introduced a chimeric gene encoding an antisense RNA of NDP kinase under the control of the Arabidopsis heat shock protein HSP81-1 promoter into rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation system. The expression of antisense RNA down-regulated the accumulation of mRNA, resulting in reduced enzyme activity even under the standard growth temperature (25 degrees C) in transgenic plants. Following heat shock treatment (37 degrees C), NDP kinase activities in some transgenic rice plants were more reduced than those grown under 25 degrees C. The comparison of the coleoptile growth under submersion showed that cell elongation process was inhibited in antisense NDP kinase transgenic plants, suggesting that an altered guanine nucleotide level may be responsible for the processes.
18923393	The Phaeodactylum genome reveals the evolutionary history of diatom genomes.	2008	Nature	Diatoms are photosynthetic secondary endosymbionts found throughout marine and freshwater environments, and are believed to be responsible for around one-fifth of the primary productivity on Earth. The genome sequence of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported, revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins, functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms. In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically different and a substantial fraction of genes ( approximately 40%) are not shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite management and for perception of environmental signals. These findings go a long way towards explaining the incredible diversity and success of the diatoms in contemporary oceans.
12172016	Functional rice centromeres are marked by a satellite repeat and a centromere-specific retrotransposon.	2002	Plant Cell	The centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes is essential for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. In the majority of eukaryotic species, centromeres are associated with highly repetitive DNA, and as a consequence, the boundary for a functional centromere is difficult to define. In this study, we demonstrate that the centers of rice centromeres are occupied by a 155-bp satellite repeat, CentO, and a centromere-specific retrotransposon, CRR. The CentO satellite is located within the chromosomal regions to which the spindle fibers attach. CentO is quantitatively variable among the 12 rice centromeres, ranging from 65 kb to 2 Mb, and is interrupted irregularly by CRR elements. The break points of 14 rice centromere misdivision events were mapped to the middle of the CentO arrays, suggesting that the CentO satellite is located within the functional domain of rice centromeres. Our results demonstrate that the CentO satellite may be a key DNA element for rice centromere function.
1844878	Organ-dependent regulation of a plant promoter isolated from rice by 'promoter-trapping' in tobacco.	1991	Plant J	A vector containing a transcriptionally inactive neomycin phosphotransferase II gene was used to select promoter sequences from a pool of random genomic DNA fragments. This paper describes how one such sequence (P4.7) isolated from Oryza sativa acts as a hormonally regulated promoter in Nicotiana tabacum. Relative expression ratios in leaf, root, midrib, callus, and stem tissue of tobacco plants are 1:5:4:10:17. Histochemical assays show that P4.7 activates the uidA reporter gene throughout the phloem and cortex of tobacco stems. Transcription from the P4.7 fragment is inducible in leaf tissue by low levels of alpha-naphthalene acetic acid or 6-benzyl-aminopurine, even when cell proliferation is inhibited by colchicine or hydroxyurea. Conversely, 1% DMSO was found to inhibit activation of P4.7 without interfering with callus formation. The fragment contains TATA and CAAT sequences normally found at the 5' end of many plant genes, and an additional region homologous to sequences located in similar positions in a variety of similarly regulated promoters. Promoter deletion and fusion experiments have indicated the location of a stem enhancer element in P4.7. The promoter trap system we have described may potentially be used to characterize transcriptional factors common to monocot and dicot species.
8315657	Fine structure and evolution of the rDNA intergenic spacer in rice and other cereals.	1993	J Mol Evol	The intergenic spacer of a rice ribosomal RNA gene repeating unit has been completely sequenced. The spacer contains three imperfect, direct repeated regions of 264-253 bp, followed by a related but more highly divergent region. Detailed analysis of the sequence allows the presentation of an evolutionary scenario in which the 264-253-bp repeats are derived from an ancestral 150-bp sequence by deletion and amplification. Comparison of the rice sequence with those of maize, wheat, and rye shows that, despite considerable divergence from the ancestral sequence, several regions have been highly conserved, suggesting that they may play an important role in the structure and/or expression of the ribosomal genes.
11710957	Potential of (GATA)n microsatellites from rice for inter- and intra-specific variability studies.	2001	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: The microsatellite, (GATA)n has been frequently used for DNA fingerprinting. However, very few attempts have been made to analyze (GATA)n-containing loci in rice.

RESULTS: Three polymorphic (GATA)n-harboring loci viz. OS1A6, OS1H10 and OS2E7, containing 7-13 repeat motifs were identified from a genomic library of a cultivated rice, Oryza sativa var. Basmati-370 using oligonucleotide probe (GATA)4. When (GATA)n flanking primers were used to screen 26 wilds (representing different genomes of rice), 16 cultivars, 47 Indian elite rice varieties and 37 lines resistant/susceptible to bacterial blight, up to 22 alleles were obtained at an individual locus. Also, interestingly the bacterial blight resistant lines clustered into a separate group from the remaining rice genotypes, when a dendrogram was constructed based on the polymorphism obtained at the three loci. This may be due to the partial homology of the clones OS1H10 and OS2E7 to regions encoding O. longistaminata receptor kinase-like protein and pathogenesis-related protein. The ability of these O. sativa flanking primers to amplify DNA of maize, wheat, barley and oat indicates that these (GATA)n-containing loci are conserved across different cereal genera.

CONCLUSIONS: The large allele number obtained reveals the potential of (GATA)n-containing loci as powerful tools to detect simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP). The (GATA)n-flanking primers were not only useful in distinguishing between closely related genotypes, but could also be used for cross-species amplification and are also conserved across different cereal genera. These loci could also cluster the bacterial blight resistant/susceptible lines into different groups based on the resistance genes present in them.
22158700	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease.	2012	Plant Physiol	Bacterial blight is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Zinc finger proteins harboring the motif with three conserved cysteine residues and one histidine residue (CCCH) belong to a large family. Although at least 67 CCCH-type zinc finger protein genes have been identified in the rice genome, their functions are poorly understood. Here, we report that one of the rice CCCH-type zinc finger proteins, C3H12, containing five typical CX(8)-CX(5)-CX(3)-H zinc finger motifs, is involved in the rice-Xoo interaction. Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice. In contrast, knockout or suppression of C3H12 resulted in partially increased susceptibility to Xoo, accompanied by decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes in rice. C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12. The C3H12 protein localized in the nucleus and possessed nucleic acid-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that C3H12, as a nucleic acid-binding protein, positively and quantitatively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and that its function is likely associated with the JA-dependent pathway.
9653153	Rice (Oryza sativa) centromeric regions consist of complex DNA.	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing centromeric DNA were isolated by using a DNA sequence (pSau3A9) that is present in the centromeres of Gramineae species. Seven distinct repetitive DNA elements were isolated from a 75-kilobase rice bacterial artificial chromosome clone. All seven DNA elements are present in every rice centromere as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Six of the elements are middle repetitive, and their copy numbers range from approximately 50 to approximately 300 in the rice genome. Five of these six middle repetitive DNA elements are present in all of the Gramineae species, and the other element is detected only in species within the Bambusoideae subfamily of Gramineae. All six middle repetitive DNA elements are dispersed in the centromeric regions. The seventh element, the RCS2 family, is a tandem repeat of a 168-bp sequence that is represented approximately 6,000 times in the rice genome and is detected only in Oryza species. Fiber-fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the RCS2 family is organized into long uninterrupted arrays and resembles previously reported tandem repeats located in the centromeres of human and Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes. We characterized a large DNA fragment derived from a plant centromere and demonstrated that rice centromeres consist of complex DNA, including both highly and middle repetitive DNA sequences.
1782676	Analysis of nuclear sequences homologous to the B4 plasmid-like DNA of rice mitochondria; evidence for sequence transfer from mitochondria to nuclei.	1991	Curr Genet	Nuclear sequences homologous to the plasmid-like DNA, B4, were analyzed in the Japonica rice variety, Fujiminori. Homologous sequences existed at several positions in the nuclear genome, but each contained only a portion of the B4 sequence. It was impossible to reconstruct the entire sequence of B4 even by collating all the homologous sequences. Overlaps between some of the B4 sequences present in the nuclear genome resulted in parts of the sequence being represented more than once. These features indicate that nuclear sequences homologous to B4 are not the origin of B4 and that they have been transferred from mitochondria and integrated into the nuclear genome. Five other foreign sequences originating in the chloroplast or mitochondrial genome were found within 1 kb of the B4-homologous sequences. Structural analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that the DNA sequences were transferred via RNA.
7719922	Mapping of sequence-tagged sites in rice by single strand conformation polymorphism.	1994	DNA Res	The conditions for efficient single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) detection were examined for its application to mapping of DNA regions in the rice genome. Temperature for electrophoresis and glycerol concentrations in gel affected SSCP patterns significantly. The optimal detection conditions for SSCP also depends on the nucleotide sequences of fragments analyzed. Fragments over 300 bp show complicated patterns depending on their nucleotide sequences and were not suitable for SSCP analysis. Seventy primer pairs were designed from the sequence data available to amplify DNA regions as sequence tagged sites (STSs), and 39 of these STSs were found to generate SSCP between japonica rice (Nipponbare) and indica rice (Kasalath) in at least one of the experimental conditions. The maps of DNA fragments amplified from 186 F2-plant DNAs with 17 primer pairs were successfully determined. This direct mapping method of the amplified DNA fragments with PCR is simple and quite sensitive, and can be used to set markers in the gap regions of a genetic linkage map.
18754079	Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance.	2008	Plant Mol Biol	CBF/DREB (C-repeat binding factor/dehydration responsive element binding factor) family of transcription factors in plants is reported to be associated with regulation of gene expression under stress conditions. Here, we report the functional characterization of a DREB transcription factor, DREB1B gene from rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold. A 745 bp promoter region of OsDREB1B cDNA was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and introduced via Agrobacterium tumifaciens into the genome of Arabidopsis. Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid. Leaf-order-dependent induction pattern of the promoter was observed in response to both cold and ABA stresses. Further, OsDREB1B cDNA was introduced into tobacco plants under the control of CaMV35S promoter to investigate the role of DREB1B product in plant stress response. Transgenic tobacco plants have shown improved seed germination, root growth, membrane stability, and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-pycrilhydrazil hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity under inhibitory concentrations of mannitol. Importantly, transgenic plants accumulated higher fresh weight under long-term osmotic stress, and also have shown retention of more water than the wild type during drought stress. Overexpression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also improved the oxidative and freezing stress tolerance of transgenic plants. In addition, tobacco plants constitutively expressing OsDREB1B have shown decreased sensitivity to tobacco streak virus infection. Constitutive expression of OsDREB1B in tobacco also induced the expression of PR genes in transgenic plants. The data obtained provide strong in vivo evidence that OsDREB1B is involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses, and confers broad-spectrum stress tolerance to transgenic plants.
22014207	A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots.	2012	Plant J	Root outer cell layers of Oryza sativa (rice), which comprise the epidermis, exodermis and sclerenchyma, play an important role in protecting the roots from various stresses in soil, but the molecular mechanisms for the specification of these cell layers are poorly understood. In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 (Docs1), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots. Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots. It encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR RLK). Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers. Immunostaining with an anti-Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region. Furthermore, Docs1 showed polar localization at the distal side. Subcellular examination showed that Docs1 was localized to the plasma membrane. Comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiles between the wild-type and the knock-out mutant roots using microarray analysis showed that 61 and 41 genes were up- and downregulated in the mutant, including genes encoding putative transcription factors and genes potentially involved in cell wall metabolism. These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice.
10589837	A tourist element in the 5'-flanking region of the catalase gene CatA reveals evolutionary relationships among Oryza species with various genome types.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	Tourist-OsaCatA, a transposable element, was found in the 5'-flanking region of the rice gene CatA. The characteristics of this element are similar to those of the other Tourist elements so far found in Oryza sativa. PCR and sequence analyses of 37 accessions of 18 species revealed that all the Oryza species examined, except for one accession, have either a full-length or a partial Tourist element at this locus. Unlike the Tourist elements previously reported, this Tourist element is found in all four Oryza species complexes in the Oryzeae tribe. All AA genome Oryza species, except O. longistaminata, contain the full-length Tourist element. O. longistaminata and the species of the O. officinalis, O. meyeriana and O. ridleyi complexes contain the partial element. A phylogenetic tree of Oryza species based on the nucleotide sequences of these Tourist elements was constructed. The O. longistaminata accessions were placed near the neighboring cluster of the officinalis complex. We propose that the ancestor of O. longistaminata and that of other species with the AA genome diverged, and the ancestor(s) of the O. officinalis, O. ridleyi and O. meyeriana complexes then diverged from the ancestor of O. longistaminata in the course of the evolution of the Oryza species. The Tourist elements associated with CatA and its orthologs thus provide useful tools for examining evolutionary relationships among Oryza species.
12234680	Identification and characterization of a novel U14 small nucleolar RNA gene cluster in Oryza sativa.	2002	Gene	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are required for ribose 2'-O-methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Through computer search in international rice genome database, a novel U14 snoRNA gene cluster, consisting of two U14 snoRNA gene candidates, was found on rice chromosome II. They both have box C/D sequences and a 14 nucleotides (nt)-long complementarity to rice 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Functional analysis of this gene cluster indicated that both were transcribed in vivo and might guide the methylations of C418 in rice 18S rRNA. By using primer extension, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the 5' and 3' ends of two snoRNAs were determined. The 52 nt long intergenic spacer of the gene cluster is rich in uridine. The absence of a conserved promoter element in this spacer, the proximity of the genes and the detection of transcripts containing linked U14 snoRNAs by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction suggest that the rice U14 snoRNAs encoded in the cluster are transcribed as a polycistron under an upstream promoter, and individual U14 snoRNAs are released after processing of the precursor RNAs.
2263449	Multiple protein factors bind to a rice glutelin promoter region.	1990	Nucleic Acids Res	Our goal is to identify cis-acting elements in the regulatory region of the major seed storage protein gene in rice. A glutelin gene (pGL5-1) has been cloned by screening a rice genomic DNA library with synthetic oligonucleotides and with an amplified DNA fragment. A transient expression assay using immature rice seeds shows that its 5' flanking sequence can direct the synthesis of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) when fused upstream of the GUS coding region. Gel-retardation assays were performed to study protein-DNA interactions between putative regulatory sequences of pGL5-1 and nuclear proteins from immature rice seeds. We demonstrate that at least six protein-DNA complexes are formed between the 5' flanking sequence of pGL5-1 (-677 to -45) and nuclear protein factors. By subsequent DNase I-footprinting analyses we defined several protein-binding regions. Two of the protein-binding sequences contain the TGAGTCA motif, which is also present in the -300 element found in the 5' flanking sequences of several storage protein genes of other crop plants, and to which the transcription factors jun and GCN4 bind.
17522955	A collection of 10,096 indica rice full-length cDNAs reveals highly expressed sequence divergence between Oryza sativa indica and japonica subspecies.	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Relatively few indica rice full-length cDNAs were available to aid in the annotation of rice genes. The data presented here described the sequencing and analysis of 10,096 full-length cDNAs from Oryza sativa subspecies indica Guangluai 4. Of them, 9,029 matched rice genomic sequences in publicly-available databases, and 1,200 were identified as new rice genes. Comparison with the knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopedia japonica cDNA collection indicated that 3,316 (41.6%) of the 7,965 indica-japonica cDNA pairs showed no distinct variations at protein level (2,117 indica-japonica cDNA pairs showed fully identical and 1,199 indica-japonica cDNA pairs showed no frame shift). Moreover, 3,645 (45.8%) of the indica-japonica pairs showed substantial differences at the protein level due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions or deletions, and sequence-segment variations between indica and japonica subspecies. Further experimental verifications using PCR screening and quantitative reverse transcriptional PCR revealed unique transcripts for indica subspecies. Comparative analysis also showed that most of rice genes were evolved under purifying selection. These variations might distinguish the phenotypic changes of the two cultivated rice subspecies indica and japonica. Analysis of these cDNAs extends known rice genes and identifies new ones in rice.
22422941	Dynamic nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat-encoding genes in the grass family.	2012	Plant Physiol	The proper use of resistance genes (R genes) requires a comprehensive understanding of their genomics and evolution. We analyzed genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeats in the genomes of rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Brachypodium distachyon. Frequent deletions and translocations of R genes generated prevalent presence/absence polymorphism between different accessions/species. The deletions were caused by unequal crossover, homologous repair, nonhomologous repair, or other unknown mechanisms. R gene loci identified from different genomes were mapped onto the chromosomes of rice cv Nipponbare using comparative genomics, resulting in an integrated map of 495 R loci. Sequence analysis of R genes from the partially sequenced genomes of an African rice cultivar and 10 wild accessions suggested that there are many additional R gene lineages in the AA genome of Oryza. The R genes with chimeric structures (termed type I R genes) are diverse in different rice accessions but only account for 5.8% of all R genes in the Nipponbare genome. In contrast, the vast majority of R genes in the rice genome are type II R genes, which are highly conserved in different accessions. Surprisingly, pseudogene-causing mutations in some type II lineages are often conserved, indicating that their conservations were not due to their functions. Functional R genes cloned from rice so far have more type II R genes than type I R genes, but type I R genes are predicted to contribute considerable diversity in wild species. Type I R genes tend to reduce the microsynteny of their flanking regions significantly more than type II R genes, and their flanking regions have slightly but significantly lower G/C content than those of type II R genes.
7902724	[Molecular study on null allolic RFLPs among rice varieties].	1993	Yi Chuan Xue Bao	Null allele is an allele that produces no functional products. In RFLP analysis, null allele means that one probe can hybridize to plant DNA from one variety readily, but very faintly to DNA from another variety or even has no hybridization signal under experimental stringency and this may be an indication of deletion, insertion or major sequence rearrangement(s) in the corresponding regions. We report here about null alleles of RFLP among 52 rice varieties uncovered with rice random genomic probe RG684. The results show that this kind of null allele is most likely to occur in typical japonica varieties distributed geographically in Northeast China and Japan, and this tendency is consistent with the hypothesis that rice evolved with a trend of from wild type-->Indica-->Japonica. Sequence analysis indicates that the sequence of RG684 has no encoding function. Therefore, changes in this region may not influence the survival of the plant. Comparison of the sequence of RG684 and gypsy transposon bx34e long terminal repeats (LTR) of D. melanogater shows homology of 78.4% of 37 base pair and this leads to the consideration that the occurrence of null alleles in rice is related to transposition or transposition-like events.
20964753	Migration, isolation and hybridization in island crop populations: the case of Madagascar rice.	2010	Mol Ecol	Understanding how crop species spread and are introduced to new areas provides insights into the nature of species range expansions. The domesticated species Oryza sativa or Asian rice is one of the key domesticated crop species in the world. The island of Madagascar off the coast of East Africa was one of the last major Old World areas of introduction of rice after the domestication of this crop species and before extensive historical global trade in this crop. Asian rice was introduced in Madagascar from India, the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia approximately 800-1400 years ago. Studies of domestication traits characteristic of the two independently domesticated Asian rice subspecies, indica and tropical japonica, suggest two major waves of migrations into Madagascar. A population genetic analysis of rice in Madagascar using sequence data from 53 gene fragments provided insights into the dynamics of island founder events during the expansion of a crop species' geographic range and introduction to novel agro-ecological environments. We observed a significant decrease in genetic diversity in rice from Madagascar when compared to those in Asia, likely the result of a bottleneck on the island. We also found a high frequency of a unique indica type in Madagascar that shows clear population differentiation from most of the sampled Asian landraces, as well as differential exchange of alleles between Asia and Madagascar populations of the tropical japonica subspecies. Finally, despite partial reproductive isolation between japonica and indica, there was evidence of indica/japonica recombination resulting from their hybridization on the island.
7774793	BamHI and HindIII repetitive DNA families in the rice genome.	1995	Genome	In this paper we describe a novel method of cloning representative members of different repetitive DNA families based on the screening of a rice (Oryza sativa) genomic library using DNA from different C0t fractions as probes. Two genomic clones, which represent two different repetitive DNA families in rice, were isolated by this method and have been characterized. Their nucleotide sequences, copy numbers, distributions in major rice genome types, methylation patterns, and chromosomal localizations were determined.
9832537	Retrotransposon-related DNA sequences in the centromeres of grass chromosomes.	1998	Genetics	Several distinct DNA fragments were subcloned from a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) bacterial artificial chromosome clone 13I16 that was derived from a centromere. Three fragments showed significant sequence identity to either Ty3/gypsy- or Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the Ty1/copia-related DNA sequences are not specific to the centromeric regions. However, the Ty3/gypsy-related sequences were present exclusively in the centromeres of all sorghum chromosomes. FISH and gel-blot hybridization showed that these sequences are also conserved in the centromeric regions of all species within Gramineae. Thus, we report a new retrotransposon that is conserved in specific chromosomal regions of distantly related eukaryotic species. We propose that the Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons in the grass centromeres may be ancient insertions and are likely to have been amplified during centromere evolution. The possible role of centromeric retrotransposons in plant centromere function is discussed.
10380800	Unusual inheritance of evolutionarily-related double-stranded RNAs in interspecific hybrid between rice plants Oryza sativa and Oryza rufipogon.	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Endogenous, 14 kb double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) have been found in two ecospecies of cultivated rice (temperate japonica rice and tropical japonica rice, Oryza sativa L.) and in wild rice (O. rufipogon, an ancestor of O. sativa). A comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the core regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains found in these three dsRNAs suggested that these dsRNAs probably evolved independently within each host plant from a common ancestor. These dsRNAs were introduced into F1 hybrids by crossing cultivated rice and wild rice. Unusual cytoplasmic inheritance of these dsRNAs was observed in some F1 hybrids; the evolutionarily related dsRNAs were incompatible for each other, and the resident dsRNA of an egg cell from cultivated rice was excluded by the incoming dsRNA of a pollen cell from wild rice. Coexisting dsRNAs in the F1 hybrids segregated away from each other in the F2 plants. However, the total amount of these dsRNAs in the host cells remained constant (ca. 100 copies/cell). The stringent regulation of the dsRNA copy number may be responsible for their unusual inheritance.
10071204	Organization of the 1.9-kb repeat unit RCE1 in the centromeric region of rice chromosomes.	1999	Mol Gen Genet	This paper presents the first report on the structure of a 14-kb centromere sequence in a cereal genome that includes 1.9-kb direct repeats. The cereal centromeric sequence (CCS1) conserved in some Gramineae species contains a 17-bp motif similar to the CENP-B box, which serves as the binding site for the centromere-specific protein CENP-B in human. To isolate centromeric units from rice (Oryza sativa L.), we performed PCR using the CENP-B box-like sequences (CBLS) as primers. A 264-bp clone was amplified by this method, and called RCS1516. It appeared to be a novel member of the CCS1 family, sharing about 60% identity with the CCS1 sequences of other cereals. Then, a 14-kb genomic clone, lambda RCB11, carrying the RCS1516 sequence was isolated and sequenced. It was found to contain three copies of a 1.9-kb direct repeat, RCE1, separated by 5.1- and 1.7-kb. A 300-bp sequence at the 3' end of RCE1 is highly conserved in all three copies (>90%) and is almost identical to the RCS1516 sequence including the CBLS motif. The copy number of RCE1 was estimated to range from 10(2) to 10(3) in the haploid genome of rice. Cloned RCE1 units were used for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and signals were observed on almost every primary constriction of rice chromosomes. Thus it was concluded that RCE1 is a significant component of the rice centromere. The lambda RCB11 clone contained at least four A/T-rich regions, which are candidate for matrix attachment regions (MARs), in the sequences between the RCE1 repeats. Other elements that are homologous to the short centromeric repetitive sequences pSau3A9 and pRG5, detected in both sorghum and rice, were also found in the clone.
8914521	Development of microsatellite markers and characterization of simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	1996	Mol Gen Genet	Microsatellite markers containing simple sequence repeats (SSR) are a valuable tool for genetic analysis. Our objective is to augment the existing RFLP map of rice with simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP). In this study, we describe 20 new microsatellite markers that have been assigned to positions along the rice chromosomes, characterized for their allelic diversity in cultivated and wild rice, and tested for amplification in distantly related species. Our results indicate that the genomic distribution of microsatellites in rice appears to be random, with no obvious bias for, or clustering in particular regions, that mapping results are identical in intersubspecific and interspecific populations, and that amplification in wild relatives of Oryza sativa is reliable in species most closely related to cultivated rice but becomes less successful as the genetic distance increases. Sequence analysis of SSLP alleles in three related indica varieties demonstrated the clustering of complex arrays of SSR motifs in a single 300-bp region with independent variation in each. Two microsatellite markers amplified multiple loci that were mapped onto independent rice chromosomes, suggesting the presence of duplicated regions within the rice genome. The availability of increasing numbers of mapped SSLP markers can be expected to increase the power and resolution of genome analysis in rice.
12845436	Genetic variations of AA genome Oryza species measured by MITE-AFLP.	2003	Theor Appl Genet	MITEs (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements) are the major transposable elements in Oryza species. We have applied the MITE-AFLP technique to study the genetic variation and species relationship in the AA-genome Oryza species. High polymorphism was detected within and between species. The genetic variation in the cultivated species, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, was comparatively lower than in their ancestral wild species. In comparison between geographical lineages of the AA genome species, African taxa, O. glaberrima and Oryza barthii, showed lower variation than the Asian taxa, O. sativa, Oryza rufipogon, and Oryza nivara, and Australian taxon Oryza meridionalis. However, another African taxon, Oryza longistaminata, showed high genetic variation. Species relationships were analyzed by the pattern of presence or absence of homologous fragments, because nucleotide sequences of the detected MITE-AFLP fragments revealed that the same fragments in different species shared very high sequence homology. The clustering pattern of the AA-genome species matched well with the geographical origins (Asian, African and Australian), and with the Australian taxon being distant to the others. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the MITE-AFLP technique is amenable for studying the genetic variation and species relationship in rice.
12893965	Genetic variation in Oryza species detected by MITE-AFLP.	2003	Genes Genet Syst	MITE-AFLP markers were successfully used to study the genetic variation and species relationship in Oryza species. Analysis of 53 accessions of Oryza species with seven MITE-AFLP primer combinations detected a total of 250 polymorphic fragments. High polymorphism was detected within and between Oryza species. Species relationships were analyzed by the pattern of presence or absence of homologous fragments, because nucleotide sequences of the detected MITE-AFLP fragments revealed that the same fragments in different species shared very high sequence homology. The genetic distances (GDs) between species were higher than those within species and the GDs in O. sativa complex were higher than those in O. officinalis complex. The phylogenetic tree recognized two major groups at 62% genetic similarity; group I consists of all AA genome species of the O. sativa complex, and group II consists of BB-, CC-, EE- and BBCC genome species of the O. officinalis complex. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the MITE-AFLP technique provide a tool for studying the genetic variation and species relationship in Oryza species.
8682306	Cloning, characterization and transient expression of the gene encoding a rice U3 small nuclear RNA.	1996	Gene	A rice U3 small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-encoding gene has been isolated. The coding region of this gene contains all five conserved sequence boxes common to plant U3 snRNAs. The upstream and downstream regions of the gene harbour characteristic sequence elements required for transcription with RNA polymerase III (pol III), as well as three monocot-specific promoter (MSP) elements [Connelly et al., Mol. Cell Biol.14 (1994) 5910-5919], two of them comprising a palindromic G+C-rich segment. The sequence (TTTAAAA) of the TATA-box in this gene does not fit the established consensus [Marshallsay et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 19(1992) 973-983], making this gene unique among reported snRNA-encoding genes of plants. An RNase protection assay showed that the gene is expressed properly in cucumber protoplasts. We thus suggest that, with other promoter elements present, the TATA-box for RNA pol III-specific snRNA-encoding genes may not be as well conserved as that for RNA pol II-specific genes.
19903220	Construction and application of efficient Ac-Ds transposon tagging vectors in rice.	2009	J Integr Plant Biol	Transposons are effective mutagens alternative to T-DNA for the generation of insertional mutants in many plant species including those whose transformation is inefficient. The current strategies of transposon tagging are usually slow and labor-intensive and yield low frequency of tagged lines. We have constructed a series of transposon tagging vectors based on three approaches: (i) AcTPase controlled by glucocorticoid binding domain/VP16 acidic activation domain/Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GVG) chemical-inducible expression system; (ii) deletion of AcTPase via Cre-lox site-specific recombination that was initially triggered by Ds excision; and (iii) suppression of early transposition events in transformed rice callus through a dual-functional hygromycin resistance gene in a novel Ds element (HPT-Ds). We tested these vectors in transgenic rice and characterized the transposition events. Our results showed that these vectors are useful resources for functional genomics of rice and other crop plants. The vectors are freely available for the community.
12454082	Different types and rates of genome evolution detected by comparative sequence analysis of orthologous segments from four cereal genomes.	2002	Genetics	Orthologous regions in barley, rice, sorghum, and wheat were studied by bacterial artificial chromosome sequence analysis. General microcolinearity was observed for the four shared genes in this region. However, three genic rearrangements were observed. First, the rice region contains a cluster of 48 predicted small nucleolar RNA genes, but the comparable region from sorghum contains no homologous loci. Second, gene 2 was inverted in the barley lineage by an apparent unequal recombination after the ancestors of barley and wheat diverged, 11-15 million years ago (mya). Third, gene 4 underwent direct tandem duplication in a common ancestor of barley and wheat 29-41 mya. All four of the shared genes show the same synonymous substitution rate, but nonsynonymous substitution rates show significant variations between genes 4a and 4b, suggesting that gene 4b was largely released from the strong purifying selection that acts on gene 4a in both barley and wheat. Intergenic retrotransposon blocks, many of them organized as nested insertions, mostly account for the lower gene density of the barley and wheat regions. All but two of the retrotransposons were found in the regions between genes, while all but 2 of the 51 inverted repeat transposable elements were found as insertions in genic regions and outside the retrotransposon blocks.
20550656	Genomic patterns of nucleotide diversity in divergent populations of U.S. weedy rice.	2010	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Weedy rice (red rice), a conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), is a significant problem throughout the world and an emerging threat in regions where it was previously absent. Despite belonging to the same species complex as domesticated rice and its wild relatives, the evolutionary origins of weedy rice remain unclear. We use genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in a broad geographic sample of weedy, domesticated, and wild Oryza samples to infer the origin and demographic processes influencing U.S. weedy rice evolution.

RESULTS: We find greater population structure than has been previously reported for U.S. weedy rice, and that the multiple, genetically divergent populations have separate origins. The two main U.S. weedy rice populations share genetic backgrounds with cultivated O. sativa varietal groups not grown commercially in the U.S., suggesting weed origins from domesticated ancestors. Hybridization between weedy groups and between weedy rice and local crops has also led to the evolution of distinct U.S. weedy rice populations. Demographic simulations indicate differences among the main weedy groups in the impact of bottlenecks on their establishment in the U.S., and in the timing of divergence from their cultivated relatives.

CONCLUSIONS: Unlike prior research, we did not find unambiguous evidence for U.S. weedy rice originating via hybridization between cultivated and wild Oryza species. Our results demonstrate the potential for weedy life-histories to evolve directly from within domesticated lineages. The diverse origins of U.S. weedy rice populations demonstrate the multiplicity of evolutionary forces that can influence the emergence of weeds from a single species complex.
3401945	Properties of the circular plasmid-like DNA, B4, from mitochondria of cytoplasmic male-sterile rice.	1988	Curr Genet	The plasmid-like DNA, B4, consisting of 969 base pairs (bp), was isolated from mitochondria of the cytoplasmic male-sterile rice, A-58 CMS. Molecular clones containing the complete B4 sequence were constructed and used in Southern hybridization to probe mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. No evidence was found for the existence of integrated copies of B4 in the main mitochondrial genomes of either the male-sterile or fertile rice. Sequences homologous to B4, however, were found in the rice nuclear genome. The complete B4 nucleotide sequence was determined, and a sequence homologous to B4 was found in the 1.9 kbp plasmid-like DNA of maize.
9669326	Identification and characterization of 14 transposon-like elements in the noncoding regions of members of the Xa21 family of disease resistance genes in rice.	1998	Mol Gen Genet	The rice disease resistance gene Xa21, which encodes a receptor-like kinase, is a member of a multigene family. Based on comparisons of genomic sequences of seven family members, seventeen transposon-like elements were identified in the 5' and 3' flanking regions and introns of these genes. Sequence characterization revealed that these elements are diverse, showing similarity to maize Ds, CACTA and miniature inverted repeat-like elements, as well as novel elements. Only two elements were located in presumed coding regions, indicating that integration of transposable elements at the Xa21 disease resistance locus occurred preferentially in noncoding regions.
22430843	Disruption of a rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein causes a seedling-specific albino phenotype and its utilization to enhance seed purity in hybrid rice production.	2012	Plant Physiol	The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene family represents one of the largest gene families in higher plants. Accumulating data suggest that PPR proteins play a central and broad role in modulating the expression of organellar genes in plants. Here we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant named young seedling albino (ysa) derived from the rice thermo/photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile line Pei'ai64S, which is a leading male-sterile line for commercial two-line hybrid rice production. The ysa mutant develops albino leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the six-leaf stage. Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in ysa mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that YSA encodes a PPR protein with 16 tandem PPR motifs. YSA is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light. We showed that the ysa mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed-setting rate, hybrid seed-setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions. We further demonstrated that ysa can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha(-1).
9681012	Gypsy-like retrotransposons are widespread in the plant kingdom.	1998	Plant J	Retrotransposons propagate via an RNA intermediate which is then reverse-transcribed and packaged into virus-like particles. They are either copia- or gypsy-like in coding domain order and sequence similarity, the gypsy-like elements sharing their organization with the retroviruses but lacking retroviral envelope domains. Copia-like retrotransposons, or at least their reverse transcriptase domains, appear broadly distributed in higher plants, but gypsy-like elements have been reported only for scattered species. The authors have exploited the difference in domain order between these groups to amplify and clone segments bridging the reverse transcriptase-integrase region of specifically gypsy-like retrotransposons. Species representative of the diversity of higher plants yielded products whose sequences establish that gypsy-like transposons are dispersed throughout the plant genomes. This class of plant elements has been named romani retrotransposons. The presence of both types ubiquitously in the fungi, plants and animals support their existence as ancient distinct lineages and subsequent, vertical radiation.
11483586	Computational and experimental analysis of microsatellites in rice (Oryza sativa L.): frequency, length variation, transposon associations, and genetic marker potential.	2001	Genome Res	A total of 57.8 Mb of publicly available rice (Oryza sativa L.) DNA sequence was searched to determine the frequency and distribution of different simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the genome. SSR loci were categorized into two groups based on the length of the repeat motif. Class I, or hypervariable markers, consisted of SSRs > or =20 bp, and Class II, or potentially variable markers, consisted of SSRs > or =12 bp <20 bp. The occurrence of Class I SSRs in end-sequences of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested BAC clones was one SSR per 40 Kb, whereas in continuous genomic sequence (represented by 27 fully sequenced BAC and PAC clones), the frequency was one SSR every 16 kb. Class II SSRs were estimated to occur every 3.7 kb in BAC ends and every 1.9 kb in fully sequenced BAC and PAC clones. GC-rich trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) were most abundant in protein-coding portions of ESTs and in fully sequenced BACs and PACs, whereas AT-rich TNRs showed no such preference, and di- and tetranucleotide repeats were most frequently found in noncoding, intergenic regions of the rice genome. Microsatellites with poly(AT)n repeats represented the most abundant and polymorphic class of SSRs but were frequently associated with the Micropon family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and were difficult to amplify. A set of 200 Class I SSR markers was developed and integrated into the existing microsatellite map of rice, providing immediate links between the genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps. This contribution brings the number of microsatellite markers that have been rigorously evaluated for amplification, map position, and allelic diversity in Oryza spp. to a total of 500.
7665075	Identification of sucrose-regulated genes in cultured rice cells using mRNA differential display.	1995	Gene	In order to get more information about carbon metabolite regulation pathways, cloning and sequence analysis of sucrose-regulated genes from rice-suspension-cultured cells were performed. We used a new method, mRNA differential display, to screen differentially expressed genes under conditions of 3% and no sucrose in the cultured medium. Six candidate clones were identified and sequenced. Clones SI1 and SI2 were repressed by sucrose starvation, while clones SR1, SR2, SR3 and SR4 were induced by sucrose starvation. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that clone SR2 has 94.8% homology to the salT gene, and clones SI1 and SR3 show 88.3 and 96.9% identity, respectively, to partial cDNA sequences in the GenBank database. The results suggest that mRNA differential display provides an easy and quick way to clone genes involved in the carbon metabolite regulation pathway.
10732686	Mapping of centromeric regions on the molecular linkage map of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using centromere-associated sequences.	2000	Mol Gen Genet	Genetic mapping of centromeres has been a challenge for plant geneticists. The objective of this study was to develop a new strategy for determining the locations of centromeric regions on genetic maps by mapping centromere-associated sequences, to make it possible to define the centromeric region of each chromosome as a single Mendelian locus on the molecular linkage map. Two DNA probes containing sequences specifically associated with the centromeres of grass species were used for genetic mapping. The centromere-associated sequences for all 12 rice chromosomes were mapped on the molecular map with either or both of the probes, and flanking molecular markers on one or both sides were localized 0 to 8 cM away. The map locations of the centromere-associated markers corresponded very well with the positions of centromeric regions determined previously using trisomic analyses for 11 of the 12 chromosomes. The precise mapping of the centromeric regions using these probes makes the molecular map a more complete and informative tool for genomic studies, which will facilitate studies of the structure and function of the rice centromeres. The simplicity of this technique, together with the fact that these probes are also associated with the centromeric regions in other grass species, may provide a general approach to the mapping of centromeric regions in the genomes of other cereal crops.
16769698	Genome-wide investigation of intron length polymorphisms and their potential as molecular markers in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2005	DNA Res	Intron length polymorphisms (ILPs) have been used as genetic markers in some studies. However, a systematic investigation and large-scale exploitation of ILP markers has not been reported. In this study, we performed a genome-wide search of ILPs between two subspecies (indica and japonica) in rice using the draft genomic sequences of cultivars 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) and 32,127 full-length cDNA sequences of Nipponbare obtained from public databases. We identified 13,308 putative ILPs. Based on these putative ILPs, we developed 5811 candidate ILP markers via electronic-PCR with primers designed in flanking exons. We further conducted experiment to verify the candidate ILP markers. Out of 215 candidate ILP markers tested on 93-11, Nipponbare and their hybrid, we successfully exploited 173 codominant ILP markers. Further analyses on 10 rice accessions showed that these ILP markers were widely applicable and most (71.1%) exhibited subspecies specificity. This feature suggests that ILPs would be useful for the studies of genome evolution and inter-subspecies heterosis and for cross-subspecies marker-assisted selection in rice. In addition, by testing 51 pairs of the ILP primers on five Gramineae plants and three dicot plants, we found another desirable characteristic of rice ILP markers that they have high transferability to other plants.
3627973	A new rice repetitive DNA shows sequence homology to both 5S RNA and tRNA.	1987	Nucleic Acids Res	Moderately repetitive DNA sequences are found in the genomes of all eucaryotes that have been examined. We now report the discovery of a novel, transcribed, moderately repetitive DNA sequence in a higher plant which is different from any of the known repetitive DNA sequences from any organism. We isolated a rice cDNA clone which hybridizes to multiple bands on genomic blot analysis. The sequence of this 352 bp cDNA contains four regions of homology to the wheat phenylalanine tRNA, including the polymerase III-type promoter. Unexpectedly, two regions of the same 352 bp sequence also show homology to the wheat 5S RNA sequence. Using the cDNA as a probe, we have isolated six genomic clones which contain long tandem repeats of 355 bp sequence, and have sequenced nine repeat units. Our findings suggest that the rice repetitive sequence may be an amplified pseudogene with sequence homology to both 5S RNA and tRNA, but organized as long tandem repeats resembling 5S RNA genes. This is the first example showing homology between the sequences of a moderately repetitive DNA with unknown function and 5S RNA.
20423466	Fine definition of the pedigree haplotypes of closely related rice cultivars by means of genome-wide discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.	2010	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: To create useful gene combinations in crop breeding, it is necessary to clarify the dynamics of the genome composition created by breeding practices. A large quantity of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is required to permit discrimination of chromosome segments among modern cultivars, which are genetically related. Here, we used a high-throughput sequencer to conduct whole-genome sequencing of an elite Japanese rice cultivar, Koshihikari, which is closely related to Nipponbare, whose genome sequencing has been completed. Then we designed a high-throughput typing array based on the SNP information by comparison of the two sequences. Finally, we applied this array to analyze historical representative rice cultivars to understand the dynamics of their genome composition.

RESULTS: The total 5.89-Gb sequence for Koshihikari, equivalent to 15.7 x the entire rice genome, was mapped using the Pseudomolecules 4.0 database for Nipponbare. The resultant Koshihikari genome sequence corresponded to 80.1% of the Nipponbare sequence and led to the identification of 67,051 SNPs. A high-throughput typing array consisting of 1917 SNP sites distributed throughout the genome was designed to genotype 151 representative Japanese cultivars that have been grown during the past 150 years. We could identify the ancestral origin of the pedigree haplotypes in 60.9% of the Koshihikari genome and 18 consensus haplotype blocks which are inherited from traditional landraces to current improved varieties. Moreover, it was predicted that modern breeding practices have generally decreased genetic diversity

CONCLUSIONS: Detection of genome-wide SNPs by both high-throughput sequencer and typing array made it possible to evaluate genomic composition of genetically related rice varieties. With the aid of their pedigree information, we clarified the dynamics of chromosome recombination during the historical rice breeding process. We also found several genomic regions decreasing genetic diversity which might be caused by a recent human selection in rice breeding. The definition of pedigree haplotypes by means of genome-wide SNPs will facilitate next-generation breeding of rice and other crops.
20829346	Molecular evolution of the endosperm starch synthesis pathway genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon L.	2011	Mol Biol Evol	The evolution of metabolic pathways is a fundamental but poorly understood aspect of evolutionary change. One approach for understanding the complexity of pathway evolution is to examine the molecular evolution of genes that together comprise an integrated metabolic pathway. The rice endosperm starch biosynthetic pathway is one of the most thoroughly characterized metabolic pathways in plants, and starch is a trait that has evolved in response to strong selection during rice domestication. In this study, we have examined six key genes (AGPL2, AGPS2b, SSIIa, SBEIIb, GBSSI, ISA1) in the rice endosperm starch biosynthesis pathway to investigate the evolution of these genes before and after rice domestication. Genome-wide sequence tagged sites data were used as a neutral reference to overcome the problems of detecting selection in species with complex demographic histories such as rice. Five variety groups of Oryza sativa (aus, indica, tropical japonica, temperate japonica, aromatic) and its wild ancestor (O. rufipogon) were sampled. Our results showed evidence of purifying selection at AGPL2 in O. rufipogon and strong evidence of positive selection at GBSSI in temperate japonica and tropical japonica varieties and at GBSSI and SBEIIb in aromatic varieties. All the other genes showed a pattern consistent with neutral evolution in both cultivated rice and its wild ancestor. These results indicate the important role of positive selection in the evolution of starch genes during rice domestication. We discuss the role of SBEIIb and GBSSI in the evolution of starch quality during rice domestication and the power and limitation of detecting selection using genome-wide data as a neutral reference.
1339378	Regulation of alpha-amylase-encoding gene expression in germinating seeds and cultured cells of rice.	1992	Gene	Four alpha-amylase-encoding cDNA (alpha Amy-C) clones were isolated from a cDNA library derived from poly(A)+RNA of gibberellic acid (GA3)-treated rice aleurone layers. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the four cDNAs were derived from different alpha Amy genes. Expression of the individual alpha Amy gene in germinating seeds and cultured suspension cells of rice was studied using gene-specific probes. In germinating seeds, expression of the alpha Amy genes is positively regulated by GA3 in a temporally coordinated but quantitatively distinct manner. In cultured suspension cells, in contrast, expression of the alpha Amy genes is negatively and differentially regulated by sugars present in the medium. In addition, one strong and one weak carbohydrate-starvation-responsive alpha Amy genes have been identified. Interactions between the promoter region (HS501) of a rice alpha Amy gene and GA3-inducible DNA binding proteins in rice aleurone cells were also studied. A DNA mobility-shift assay showed that the aleurone proteins interact with two specific DNA fragments within HS501. One fragment is located between nt -131 to -170 and contains two imperfect directly repeated pyrimidine elements and a putative GA3-response element. The other fragment is located between nt -92 to -130 that contains a putative enhancer sequence. The interactions between aleurone proteins and these two fragments are sequence-specific and GA-responsive.
14503923	Ds tagging of BRANCHED FLORETLESS 1 (BFL1) that mediates the transition from spikelet to floret meristem in rice (Oryza sativa L).	2003	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The genetics of spikelet formation, a feature unique to grasses such as rice and maize, is yet to be fully understood, although a number of meristem and organ identity mutants have been isolated and investigated in Arabidopsis and maize. Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (bfl1) which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem.

RESULTS: The bfl1 mutant shows normal differentiation of the primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop empty glumes and florets. Instead, axillary meristems in the bract-like structure produce sequential alternate branching, thus resulting in a coral shaped morphology of the branches in the developing panicle. The bfl1 mutant harbours a single Ds insertion in the upstream region of the BFL1 gene on chromosome 7 corresponding to PAC clone P0625E02 (GenBank Acc No. message URL http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&list_uids=34395191&dopt=GenBank&term=ap004570AP004570). RT-PCR analyses revealed a drastic reduction of BFL1 transcript levels in the bfl1 mutant compared to that in the wild-type. In each of the normal panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the bfl1 locus. BFL1 contains an EREBP/AP2 domain and is most likely an ortholog of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1).

CONCLUSIONS: bfl1 is a Ds-tagged rice mutant defective in the transition from spikelet meristem (SM) to floret meristem (FM). BFL1 is most probably a rice ortholog of the maize ERF (EREBP/AP2) transcription factor gene BD1. Based on the similarities in mutant phenotypes bfl1 is likely to be an allele of the previously reported frizzy panicle locus.
18438436	Molecular and cytological characterization of 5S rDNA in Oryza species: genomic organization and phylogenetic implications.	2008	Genome	We investigated the molecular characteristics and chromosomal organization of 5S rDNA in the genus Oryza, including diploid and tetraploid species. A phylogenetic tree of Oryza species was constructed based on the non-transcribed spacer sequences of 5S rDNA, and some novel relationships were discovered. Specifically, comparative sequence analysis of 5S rDNA in several wild rice species showed unique characteristics inconsistent with the model of concerted evolution: (1) multiple distinct 5S rDNA types were detected within a species, leading to intraspecific divergence of 5S rDNA; (2) multiple identical 5S rDNA types were shared among species, resulting in interspecies clustering of 5S rDNA types; and (3) intraspecific nucleotide diversity was detected within a 5S rDNA class. Our results obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that each rice species studied contained only one 5S rDNA locus with two hybridization sites, which were located on either chromosome 7 or chromosome 11. These results suggest that different 5S rDNA classes within the rice genome were arranged together and that one pair of 5S rDNA loci from a diploid progenitor of the tetraploid species might have been lost during evolution. Taken together, our data show that 5S rDNA in rice species is more informative at the gene level than at the chromosome level.
21084222	Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, OsHAK5, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells.	2011	J Biosci Bioeng	Potassium ion (K(+)) plays vital roles in many aspects of cellular homeostasis including competing with sodium ion (Na(+)) during potassium starvation and salt stress. Therefore, one way to engineer plant cells with improved salt tolerance is to enhance K(+) uptake activity of the cells, while keeping Na(+) out during salt stress. Here, in search for Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter for this purpose, bacterial expression system was used to characterize two K(+) transporters, OsHAK2 and OsHAK5, isolated from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare). The two OsHAK transporters are members of a KT/HAK/KUP transporter family, which is one of the major K(+) transporter families in bacteria, fungi and plants. When expressed in an Escherichia coli K(+) transport mutant strain LB2003, both OsHAK transporters rescued the growth defect in K(+)-limiting conditions by significantly increasing the K(+) content of the cells. Under the condition with a large amount of extracellular Na(+), we found that OsHAK5 functions as a Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter, while OsHAK2 is sensitive to extracellular Na(+) and exhibits higher Na(+) over K(+) transport activities. Moreover, constitutive expression of OsHAK5 in cultured-tobacco BY2 (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2) cells enhanced the accumulation of K(+) but not Na(+) in the cells during salt stress and conferred increased salt tolerance to the cells. Transient expression experiment indicated that OsHAK5 is localized to the plant plasma membrane. These results suggest that the plasma-membrane localized Na(+) insensitive K(+) transporters, similar to OsHAK5 identified here, could be used as a tool to enhance salt tolerance in plant cells.
22399582	Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Flowering time of rice depends strongly on photoperiodic responses. We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Here, we show that the difference may result from a single nucleotide polymorphism within a putative gene that encodes a homolog of the Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 protein, which plays important roles in maintaining circadian rhythms. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway.
22422935	Ef7 encodes an ELF3-like protein and promotes rice flowering by negatively regulating the floral repressor gene Ghd7 under both short- and long-day conditions.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Much progress has been made in our understanding of photoperiodic flowering of rice and the mechanisms underlying short-day (SD) promotion and long-day (LD) repression of floral induction. In this study, we identified and characterized the Ef7 gene, one of the rice orthologs of Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). The ef7 mutant HS276, which was induced by γ-irradiation of the japonica rice cultivar 'Gimbozu', flowers late under both SD and LD conditions. Expression analyses of flowering time-related genes demonstrated that Ef7 negatively regulates the expression of Ghd7, which is a repressor of the photoperiodic control of rice flowering, and consequently up-regulates the expression of the downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes under both SD and LD conditions. Genetic analyses with a non-functional Ghd7 allele provided further evidence that the delayed flowering of ef7 is mediated through the Ghd7 pathway. The analysis of light-induced expression of Ghd7 revealed that the ef7 mutant was more sensitive to red light than the wild-type plant, but the gate of Ghd7 expression was unchanged. Thus, our results show that Ef7 functions as a floral promoter by repressing Ghd7 expression under both SD and LD conditions.
21373980	Characterization and fine mapping of the rice blast resistance gene Pia.	2011	Sci China Life Sci	Blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most widespread and destructive diseases of rice. Breeding durable resistant cultivars (cvs) can be achieved by pyramiding of various resistance (R) genes. Pia, carried by cv. Aichi Asahi, was evaluated against 612 isolates of M. oryzae collected from 10 Chinese provinces. The Pia gene expresses weak resistance in all the provinces except for Jiangsu. Genomic position-ready marker-based linkage analysis was carried out in a mapping population consisting of 800 F(2) plants derived from a cross of Aichi Asahi×Kasalath. The locus was defined in an interval of approximately 90 kb, flanked by markers A16 and A21. Four candidate genes (Pia-1, Pia-2, Pia-3, and Pia-4), all having the R gene conserved structure, were predicted in the interval using the cv. Nipponbare genomic sequence. Four candidate resistance gene (CRG) markers (A17, A25, A26, and A27), derived from the four candidates, were subjected to genotyping with the recombinants detected at the flanking markers. The first three markers completely co-segregated with the Pia locus, and the fourth was absent in the Aichi Asahi genome and disordered with the Pia locus and its flanking markers, indicating that the fourth candidate gene, Pia-4, could be excluded. Co-segregation marker-based genotyping of the three sets of differentials with known R gene genotypes revealed that the genotype of A26 (Pia-3) perfectly matched the R gene genotype of Pia, indicating that Pia-3 is the strongest candidate gene for Pia.
21726398	Building a mutant resource for the study of disease resistance in rice reveals the pivotal role of several genes involved in defence.	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	In Arabidopsis, gene expression studies and analysis of knock-out (KO) mutants have been instrumental in building an integrated view of disease resistance pathways. Such an integrated view is missing in rice where shared tools, including genes and mutants, must be assembled. This work provides a tool kit consisting of informative genes for the molecular characterization of the interaction of rice with the major fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. It also provides for a set of eight KO mutants, all in the same genotypic background, in genes involved in key steps of the rice disease resistance pathway. This study demonstrates the involvement of three genes, OsWRKY28, rTGA2.1 and NH1, in the establishment of full basal resistance to rice blast. The transcription factor OsWRKY28 acts as a negative regulator of basal resistance, like the orthologous barley gene. Finally, the up-regulation of the negative regulator OsWRKY28 and the down-regulation of PR gene expression early during M. oryzae infection suggest that the fungus possesses infection mechanisms that enable it to block host defences.
18932023	Cell differentiation in the longitudinal veins and formation of commissural veins in rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays).	2008	J Plant Res	Vascular development is a central theme in plant science. However, little is known about the mechanism of vascular development in monocotyledons (compared with dicotyledons). Therefore, we investigated sequential processes of differentiation into various different vascular cells by carrying out detailed observations using serial sections of the bases of developing leaves of rice and maize. The developmental process of the longitudinal vascular bundles was divided into six stages in rice and five stages in maize. The initiation of differentiation into procambial progenitor cells forming the commissural vein arose in a circular layer cell that was adjacent to both a metaxylem vessel and one or a few phloem cells in stage V longitudinal vascular bundles. In most cases the differentiation of ground meristem cells into procambial progenitor cells extended in one direction, toward the next longitudinal vascular bundle, and subsequent periclinal divisions and further differentiation produced a vessel element, two companion cells and a sieve element to form a commissural vein. These results suggest the presence of an intercellular signal(s) that induces differentiation of the circular layer cell and the ground meristem cells into procambial progenitor cells, forming a commissural vein sequentially.
22914168	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency.	2012	Nature	As an essential macroelement for all living cells, phosphorus is indispensable in agricultural production systems. Natural phosphorus reserves are limited, and it is therefore important to develop phosphorus-efficient crops. A major quantitative trait locus for phosphorus-deficiency tolerance, Pup1, was identified in the traditional aus-type rice variety Kasalath about a decade ago. However, its functional mechanism remained elusive until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene, which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1). This gene is absent from the rice reference genome and other phosphorus-starvation-intolerant modern varieties. Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil. Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients. The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm. Introgression of this quantitative trait locus into locally adapted rice varieties in Asia and Africa is expected to considerably enhance productivity under low phosphorus conditions.
22875749	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Both the WRKY transcription factor (TF) and MAP kinases have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Several reports have shown that WRKY TFs may function downstream of MAPK cascades. Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14. Overexpression of OsWRKY30 in rice dramatically increased drought tolerance. Overexpression of OsWRKY30AA, in which all SP (serine residue followed by proline residue) sites were replaced by AP (A, alanine), resulted in no improvement in drought tolerance. In addition, the function of transcriptional activation of OsWRKY30 was impaired after SP was replaced by AP. These results proved that the phosphorylation of OsWRKY30 by MAPKs was crucial in order for OsWRKY30 to perform its biological function.
22903031	A metagenomic approach for the identification and cloning of an endoglucanase from rice straw compost.	2013	Gene	Over the years, culturable cellulase-producing microorganisms have been isolated from a variety of sources and genes of cellulolytic enzymes have been cloned. Then again, the "great plate count anomaly" phenomenon necessitates a culture-independent metagenomic approach for the isolation of cellulolytic genes from microorganisms in their natural environment. We have constructed a metagenomic library derived from rice straw composts. Of 2739 clones screened, a lambda clone carrying a 12kb genomic fragment was able to yield a clear zone on an agar plate containing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). A 4.7kb subclone, generated by restriction enzyme digestion, was found to harbor a GH12 cellulase gene, RSC-EG1, encoding 464 amino acids along with two other ORFs. The identified cellulolytic gene showed more than 70% similarity on the amino acid level with cellulase from Micromonospora aurantiaca and Thermobispora sp. Interestingly, RSC-EG1 contains a stretch of approximately 86 amino acids not present in either of these close relatives. Our results demonstrated that RSC-EG1, stable over a wide temperature and pH range, is a novel endoglucanase, and provided the first example of metagenomics approach to isolate cellulolytic gene from rice straw composts.
11922106	Auxin response factor family in rice.	2001	Genes Genet Syst	We isolated 11 rice genes homologous to the genes encoding auxin response factors (ARFs) in Arabidopsis. All of the genes encoded a well-conserved amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region, which is considered to be a DNA-binding domain (DBD). Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison of the DBDs indicated that rice has one or two closely related orthologs corresponding to a given respective ARF gene in Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the amino acid sequences of another conserved domain in the C-terminal conserved domain (CTD), which was shared by almost all the rice ARFs, with the exception of OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2. These results agreed well with the evolutionary relationship deduced from the DBD comparison. In contrast to many ARFs, OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 do not contain the conserved C-terminal domain, but do share another consensus motif that is also found in Arabidopsis ETTIN. All of the above observations indicate that rice has functionally diversified ARF genes whose structures and functions correspond to those of various Arabidopsis ARFs, with one or two rice ARFs corresponding to a given Arabidopsis ARF. Thus, auxin signal transduction mechanisms may be well conserved between monocot and dicot plants.
17408882	Genome-wide analysis of the auxin response factors (ARF) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2007	Gene	Auxin response factors (ARFs) are transcription factors that bind with specificity to TGTCTC-containing auxin response elements (AuxREs) found in promoters of primary/early auxin response genes and mediate responses to the plant hormone auxin. The ARF genes are represented by a large multigene family in plants. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was carried out in this study to find all ARFs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica), 23 and 25 ARF genes, named as AtARFs and OsARFs, were identified, respectively. Chromosomal locations of all OsARFs were presented and it was found that the duplication of OsARFs was associated with only the chromosomal block duplications but not local tandem duplications. A phylogenetic tree was generated from alignments of the full-length protein sequences of 25 OsARFs and 23 AtARFs to examine the phylogenetic relationships of rice and Arabidopsis ARF proteins. All 48 members of ARF gene families fell into three major classes, a total of 13 sister pairs, including 9 OsARF-OsARF, 2 AtARF-AtARF and 2 AtARF-OsARF sister pairs were formed, showing different orthologous relationships between AtARFs and OsARFs. EST analysis and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that 24 of all 25 OsARF genes were active and the transcript abundance of some OsARF genes was affected by auxin treatment or light- and dark-grown conditions. The outcome of the present study provides basic genomic information for the rice ARF gene family and will pave the way for elucidating the precise role of OsARFs in plant growth and development in the future.
19193962	Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of OsARF1, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice.	2009	Curr Issues Mol Biol	OsARF1 is the first full-length member of auxin response factor (ARF) gene family to be cloned from monocot plant. Using quantitative RT-PCR this study found that, the transcript abundance of OsARF1 was significantly higher in embryonic tissues than in vegetative tissues. To investigate the effect of OsARF1 on the phenotype of rice, a cDNA fragment of OsARF1 was inserted in inverse orientation to the 35S promoter in vector pBin438 to produce an antisense (AS) construction. The AS-OsARF1 construct was transferred into rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica) calli via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Molecular analysis of transgenic plants showed that the functional expression of OsARF1 was inhibited at mRNA level efficiently. The AS-OsARF1 plants showed extremely low growth, poor vigor, short curled leaves and tillered but were sterile. Therefore, the OsARF1 was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development.
21087465	Classification of rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica nipponbare) immunophilins (FKBPs, CYPs) and expression patterns under water stress.	2010	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. They are collectively referred to as immunophilin (IMM), being present in almost all cellular organs. In particular, a number of IMMs relate to environmental stresses.

RESULTS: FKBP and CYP proteins in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica) were identified and classified, and given the appropriate name for each IMM, considering the ortholog-relation with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas or molecular weight of the proteins. 29 FKBP and 27 CYP genes can putatively be identified in rice; among them, a number of genes can be putatively classified as orthologs of Arabidopsis IMMs. However, some genes were novel, did not match with those of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, and several genes were paralogs by genetic duplication. Among 56 IMMs in rice, a significant number are regulated by salt and/or desiccation stress. In addition, their expression levels responding to the water-stress have been analyzed in different tissues, and some subcellular IMMs located by means of tagging with GFP protein.

CONCLUSION: Like other green photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis (23 FKBPs and 29 CYPs) and Chlamydomonas (23 FKBs and 26 CYNs), rice has the highest number of IMM genes among organisms reported so far, suggesting that the numbers relate closely to photosynthesis. Classification of the putative FKBPs and CYPs in rice provides the information about their evolutional/functional significance when comparisons are drawn with the relatively well studied genera, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. In addition, many of the genes upregulated by water stress offer the possibility of manipulating the stress responses in rice.
21904112	A non-destructive screenable marker, OsFAST, for identifying transgenic rice seeds.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	The production of transgenic plants has contributed greatly to plant research. Previously, an improved method for screening transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds using the FAST (Fluorescence-Accumulating-Seed Technology) method and FAST marker was reported. Arabidopsis seeds containing the FAST marker may be visually screened using a fluorescence stereomicroscope or blue LED handy-type instrument. Although the FAST method was originally designed for Arabidopsis screens, this study endeavors to adapt this method for the screening of other plants. Here, an optimized technology, designated the OsFAST method, is presented as a useful tool for screening transgenic rice seeds. The OsFAST method is based on the expression of the OsFAST-G marker under the control of a seed-embryo-specific promoter, similar to the Arabidopsis FAST-G marker. The OsFAST method provides a simple and non-destructive method for identifying transgenic rice seeds. It is proposed that the FAST method is adaptable to various plant species and will enable a deeper analysis of the floral-dip method.
22548273	The OsHMA2 transporter is involved in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants and humans. Cadmium (Cd) is a Zn analog and one of the most toxic heavy metals to humans. Here we investigated the role of the Zn/Cd transporter OsHMA2. OsHMA2:GFP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The yeast expressing OsHMA2 was able to reverse the growth defect in the presence of excess Zn. The expression of OsHMA2 in rice was observed mainly in the roots where OsHMA2 transcripts were abundant in vascular bundles. Furthermore, Zn and Cd concentrations of OsHMA2-suppressed rice decreased in the leaves, while the Zn concentration increased in the roots compared with the wild type (WT). These results suggest that OsHMA2 plays a role in Zn and Cd loading to the xylem and participates in root-to-shoot translocation of these metals in rice. Furthermore, the Cd concentration in the grains of OsHMA2-overexpressing rice as well as in OsSUT1-promoter OsHMA2 rice decreased to about half that of the WT, although the other metal concentrations were the same as in the WT. A phenotype that reduces only the Cd concentration in rice grains will be very useful for transgenic approaches to food safety.
21108023	Ectopic expression of the K+ channel β subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis.	2011	Mol Biotechnol	In this study, we cloned a cDNA for the K+ channel β subunit from the halophyte Puccinellia tenuiflora and named it KPutB1. KPutB1 was preferentially expressed in the roots and was transiently induced by K+-starvation, salt stress, or the combination of both stresses. By yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that KPutB1 interacts with PutAKT1, α subunit of an AKT1-type K+ channel of P. tenuiflora. The functional relevance of this interaction on K+-nutrition was investigated by co-expression experiments in yeast under various ionic conditions, and K+ channel α and β subunit homologues from rice (OsAKT1 and KOB1, respectively) were included for comparison. Yeast co-expressing PutAKT1 and the β subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) had better growth and higher K+-uptake ability than yeast expressing PutAKT1 alone. In contrast, yeast co-expressing the β subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) with OsAKT1 had slower growth and lower K+ uptake than yeast expressing OsAKT1 alone. Arabidopsis plants over-expressing the K+ channel β subunit of P. tenuiflora or rice showed increased shoot K+ content and decreased root Na+ content under control, 75 mM NaCl, and K+-starvation stress conditions. These results suggest that ectopic expression of the K+ channel β subunit could alter K+ and Na+ homeostasis in plants.
21670506	Rice ABCG43 is Cd inducible and confers Cd tolerance on yeast.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	An understanding of the cadmium (Cd) transport system in rice can serve as a basis for coping with Cd-related problems in rice and human health. To identify a new gene involved in Cd transport in rice, we screened our yeast library, expressing 140 kinds of rice ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters. From the screening, we found that OsABCG43/PDR5 conferred high Cd tolerance on yeast. The Cd concentration of yeast carrying OsABCG43 was similar to that of the vector control. The OsABCG43 transcript was detected both in shoots and roots. Accumulation of it was elevated by Cd treatment in the roots but not in the shoots. This study indicates that OsABCG43 is a Cd inducible-transporter gene capable of conferring Cd tolerance on yeast.
22528669	Reactive oxygen species production and activation mechanism of the rice NADPH oxidase OsRbohB.	2012	J Biochem	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by plant NADPH oxidases (NOXes) are important in plant innate immunity. The Oryza sativa respiratory burst oxidase homologue B (OsRbohB) gene encodes a NOX the regulatory mechanisms of which are largely unknown. Here, we used a heterologous expression system to demonstrate that OsRbohB shows ROS-producing activity. Treatment with ionomycin, a Ca(2+) ionophore, and calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, activated ROS-producing activity; it was thus OsRbohB activated by both Ca(2+) and protein phosphorylation. Mutation analyses revealed that not only the first EF-hand motif but also the upstream amino-terminal region were necessary for Ca(2+)-dependent activation, while these regions are not required for phosphorylation-induced ROS production.
22526427	Comprehensive gene expression analysis of the NAC gene family under normal growth conditions, hormone treatment, and drought stress conditions in rice using near-isogenic lines (NILs) generated from crossing Aday Selection (drought tolerant) and IR64.	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) genes are plant-specific transcriptional factors known to play diverse roles in various plant developmental processes. We describe the rice (Oryza sativa) OsNAC genes expression profiles (GEPs) under normal and water-deficit treatments (WDTs). The GEPs of the OsNAC genes were analyzed in 25 tissues covering the entire life cycle of Minghui 63. High expression levels of 17 genes were demonstrated in certain tissues under normal conditions suggesting that these genes may play important roles in specific organs. We determined that 16 genes were differentially expressed under at least 1 phytohormone (NAA, GA3, KT, SA, ABA, and JA) treatment. To investigate the GEPs in the root, leaf, and panicle of three rice genotypes [e.g., 2 near-isogenic lines (NILs) and IR64], we used two NILs from a common genetic combination backcross developed by Aday Selection and IR64. WDTs were applied using the fraction of transpirable soil water at severe, mild, and control conditions. Transcriptomic analysis using a 44K oligoarray from Agilent was performed on all the tissue samples. We identified common and specific genes in all tissues from the two NILs under both WDTs, and the majority of the OsNAC genes that were activated were in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line compared with the drought-susceptible IR77298-14-1-2-B-13 or IR64. In IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, seventeen genes were very specific in their expression levels. Approximately 70 % of the genes from subgroups SNAC and NAM/CUC3 were activated in the leaf, but 37 % genes from subgroup SND were inactivated in the root compared with the control under severe stress conditions. These results provide a useful reference for the cloning of candidate genes from the specific subgroup for further functional analysis.
22644443	OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Graminaceous plants acquire iron by secreting mugineic acid family phytosiderophores into the rhizosphere and taking up complexes of iron and phytosiderophores through YSL (yellow stripe 1-like) transporters. Rice OsYSL15 is a transporter of the iron(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complex. OsYSL16 has 85 % similarity to both OsYSL15 and the iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2. In the present study, we show that OsYSL16 functionally complemented a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when grown on medium containing iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not when grown on medium containing iron(II)-nicotianamine. OsYSL16-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source. The iron concentration in shoots of OsYSL16-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions. Furthermore, OsYSL16-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves. Expression of the OsYSL16 promoter fused to the β-glucuronidase gene showed that OsYSL16 is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants. The expression was typically observed around the xylem. In the vascular bundles of unelongated nodes, it was detected in the xylem of old leaves and the phloem of new leaves. Graminaceous plants translocate iron from the roots to old leaves mainly via the xylem and to new leaves mainly via the phloem. Our results suggest that OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles.
22626555	PHD finger of the SUMO ligase Siz/PIAS family in rice reveals specific binding for methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 and arginine 2.	2012	FEBS Lett	We determined the three-dimensional structure of the PHD finger of the rice Siz/PIAS-type SUMO ligase, OsSiz1, by NMR spectroscopy and investigated binding ability for a variety of methylated histone H3 tails, showing that OsSiz1-PHD primarily recognizes dimethylated Arg2 of the histone H3 and that methylations at Arg2 and Lys4 reveal synergy effect on binding to OsSiz1-PHD. The K4 cage of OsSiz1-PHD for trimethylated Lys4 of H3K4me3 was similar to that of the BPTF-PHD finger, while the R2 pocket for Arg2 was different. It is intriguing that the PHD module of Siz/PIAS plays an important role, with collaboration with the DNA binding domain SAP, in gene regulation through SUMOylation of a variety of effectors associated with the methylated arginine-riched chromatin domains.
22751305	Roles of a putative mechanosensitive plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channel OsMCA1 in generation of reactive oxygen species and hypo-osmotic signaling in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing hypo-osmotic stress, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network involving second messengers such as Ca(2+) to trigger inducible defense responses including the induction of transcriptional factors. However, most of the components involved in these signaling networks still remain to be identified. Recently we identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole homolog of the MCA family putative Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels in rice. Functional characterization of the OsMCA1-suppressed cells as well as the overexpressing cells indicated that OsMCA1 is involved in the regulation of plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx and NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hypo-osmotic stress. Here we will discuss possible molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of the MCA protein in hypo-osmotic signaling.
22732245	Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene OsMGT1 is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Magnesium (Mg)-mediated alleviation of aluminum (Al) toxicity has been observed in a number of plant species, but the mechanisms underlying the alleviation are still poorly understood. When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (OsMGT1), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased. However, this inhibition could be rescued by addition of 10 μm Mg, but not by the same concentration of barium or strontium. OsMGT1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots in the absence of Al, but the expression only in the roots was rapidly up-regulated by Al. Furthermore, the expression did not respond to low pH and other metals including cadmium and lanthanum, and was regulated by an Al-responsive transcription factor, AL RESISTANCE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1. An investigation of subcellular localization showed that OsMGT1 was localized to the plasma membrane. A short-term (30 min) uptake experiment with stable isotope (25)Mg showed that knockout of OsMGT1 resulted in decreased Mg uptake, but that the uptake in the wild type was enhanced by Al. Mg concentration in the cell sap of the root tips was also increased in the wild-type rice, but not in the knockout lines in the presence of Al. A microarray analysis showed that transcripts of genes related to stress were more up- and down-regulated in the knockout lines. Taken together, our results indicate that OsMGT1 is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up-regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell.
22751306	OsNRAMP5, a major player for constitutive iron and manganese uptake in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential mineral micronutrients for plants and their deficiency and or toxicity represents a serious agricultural problem. In rice the information about genes involved in Mn uptake from soil is scarce. Recently, we showed that OsNRAMP5 is a plasma membrane protein involved in Mn and Fe transport. The concentration of Mn in roots, shoots and xylem sap of OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants was significantly reduced compared with WT plants. The expression of OsNRAMP5 is not controlled by Fe deficiency in root and was also observed in pistil, ovary, lemma and palea. These data show that rice would utilize OsNRAMP5 for constitutive Fe and Mn uptake, while OsNRAMP5 would also play a role in Fe and Mn transport during flowering and seed development.
22681566	Physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	For many decades, researchers have focused on the self-sustainable oscillations of plant circadian clocks, which can only be observed under artificial constant environmental conditions. However, plants have evolved under natural diurnal conditions where several major environmental cues such as light, temperature and humidity are dramatically changing and interacting with each other. Therefore, little is known about the roles of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions. Molecular genetic analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that some core circadian clock genes are required for the establishment of robust circadian rhythms under artificial diurnal conditions, and that others function only as self-oscillators. However, it is largely unknown yet how those robust rhythms can be obtained under natural diurnal conditions. Recently, an extensive time-course transcriptome analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) leaves in natural field conditions revealed that OsGIGANTEA, the sole rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis GIGANTEA gene, governs the robust diurnal rhythm of rice leaf transcriptomes even under natural diurnal conditions; rice Osgi mutants exhibited severely defective transcriptome rhythms under strong diurnal changes in environmental cues. This review focuses on the physiological significance of the plant circadian clock in natural field conditions.
22683629	The thioredoxin gene family in rice: genome-wide identification and expression profiling under different biotic and abiotic treatments.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Thioredoxin (TRX) is a multi-functional redox protein. Genome-wide survey and expression profiles of different stresses were observed. Conserved amino acid residues and phylogeny construction using the OsTRX conserved domain sequence suggest that the TRX gene family can be classified broadly into six subfamilies in rice. We compared potential gene birth-and-death events in the OsTRX genes. The Ka/Ks ratio is a measure to explore the mechanism and 3 evolutionary stages of the OsTRX genes divergence after duplication. We used 270 TRX genes from monocots and eudicots for synteny analysis. Furthermore, we investigated expression profiles of this gene family under 5 biotic and 3 abiotic stresses. Several genes were differentially expressed with high levels of expression and exhibited subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization after the duplication event response to different stresses, which provides novel reference for the cloning of the most promising candidate genes from OsTRX gene family for further functional analysis.
22764280	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active gibberellin content in rice seedlings with simultaneous repression of two gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4) and acute induction of four gibberellin 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-OsGA2ox7). For further examination of the regulation of these genes, we established a series of cryptochrome-deficient lines through reverse genetic screening from a Tos17 mutant population and construction of knockdown lines based on an RNA interference technique. By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes. On the other hand, repression of the GA20ox genes is mediated by phytochromes. In addition, we found that the phytochromes also mediate the repression of a gibberellin 3-oxidase gene (OsGA3ox2) in the light. These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity. The cry1 action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active gibberellin content, but, in rice seedlings, the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active gibberellin content in the light. This pathway design in which different types of photoreceptors independently but cooperatively regulate active gibberellin content is unique from the viewpoint of dicot research. This redundancy should provide robustness to the response in rice plants.
22824965	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice.	2012	Planta	Binding protein (BiP) is a chaperone protein involved in the folding of secretory proteins in the ER lumen. OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions. However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice. In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment. When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1. These results indicate that OsBiP4&5 levels were positively correlated with stress levels in the ER. Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice.

22891159	Functional characterization of CEBiP and CERK1 homologs in arabidopsis and rice reveals the presence of different chitin receptor systems in plants.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Chitin is a representative microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecule for various fungi and induces immune responses in many plant species. It has been clarified that the chitin signaling in rice requires a receptor kinase OsCERK1 and a receptor-like protein (Os)CEBiP, which specifically binds chitin oligosaccharides. On the other hand, Arabidopsis requires a receptor kinase (At)CERK1 for chitin signaling but it is not clear whether the plant also requires a CEBiP-like molecule for chitin perception/signaling. To clarify the similarity/difference of the chitin receptor in these two model plants, we first characterized CEBiP homologs in Arabidopsis. Only one of three CEBiP homologs, AtCEBiP (LYM2), showed a high-affinity binding for chitin oligosaccharides similar to rice CEBiP. AtCEBiP also represented the major chitin-binding protein in the Arabidopsis membrane. However, the single/triple knockout (KO) mutants of Arabidopsis CEBiP homologs and the overexpressor of AtCEBiP showed chitin-induced defense responses similar to wild-type Arabidopsis, indicating that AtCEBiP is biochemically functional as a chitin-binding protein but does not contribute to signaling. Studies of the chitin binding properties of the ectodomains of At/OsCERK1 and the chimeric receptors consisting of ecto/cytosolic domains of these molecules indicated that AtCERK1 is sufficient for chitin perception by itself.
22915302	DDM1 (decrease in DNA methylation) genes in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	Regulation of cytosine methylation in the plant genome is of pivotal in determining the epigenetic states of chromosome regions. Relative tolerance of plant to deficiency in cytosine methylation provides unparalleled opportunities to study the mechanism for regulation of cytosine methylation. The Decrease in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1) of Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the best characterized plant epigenetic regulators that are necessary for maintenance of cytosine methylation in genomic DNA. Although cytosine methylation could affect various aspects of plant growth and development including those related to agricultural importance, orthologs of DDM1 in plants other than Arabidopsis has not been studied in detail. In this study, we identified two rice genes with similarity to Arabidopsis DDM1 and designated them OsDDM1a and OsDDM1b. Both of the rice DDM1 homologs are transcribed during development and their amino acid sequences are 93 % identical to each other. Transgenic rice lines expressing the OsDDM1a cDNA in the antisense orientation exhibited genomic DNA hypomethylation. In those lines, repeated sequences were more severely affected than a single copy sequence as is the case in Arabidopsis ddm1 mutants. Transcripts derived from endogenous transposon-related loci were up-regulated in the antisense OsDDM1 lines, opening a possibility to identify and utilize potentially active transposons for rice functional genomics.

21429786	The role of QTLs in the breeding of high-yielding rice.	2011	Trends Plant Sci	Food shortages have once again become a serious problem, not only because of world population growth but also as a result of escalating demand for crops as a substrate for biofuels. The production of improved plant varieties, especially major crops such as rice, is urgently required to increase yield. The completion of the sequencing of the rice genome has made it possible to clone and analyze quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Furthermore, the development of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies has improved spectacularly the accuracy of QTL analysis. In this review article, we focus on the potential roles of major QTLs in the selection for agronomic traits in rice and discuss the application of high-throughput technologies for high-resolution genetic analysis.
20934370	Rice growth adapting to deepwater.	2011	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Flooding is one of the most hazardous natural disasters, and there are several levels of flooding. Recently, research on flood-tolerant rice plants revealed that some rice varieties have evolved to overcome two different flood types, 'flash flood' and 'deepwater flood', using two different mechanisms, and their molecular mechanisms were determined. During flash flooding, the tolerant plants that are fully submerged for a few weeks stop elongating and thus avoid energy consumption that will be needed to restart growth when the water recedes. On the contrary, during deepwater flooding, with water depth up to several meters for several months, the deepwater-flood-tolerant rice plants promote elongation of internodes to keep the foliage above the water surface and thus allow respiration and photosynthesis.

21873330	Allocation of absorbed light energy in PSII to thermal dissipations in the presence or absence of PsbS subunits of rice.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The thermal dissipation (TD) of absorbed light energy in PSII is considered to be an important photoprotection process in photosynthesis. A major portion of TD has been visualized through the analysis of Chl fluorescence as energy quenching (qE) which depends on the presence of the PsbS subunit. Although the physiological importance of qE-associated TD (qE-TD) has been widely accepted, it is not yet clear how much of the absorbed light energy is dissipated through a qE-associated mechanism. In this study, the fates of absorbed light energy in PSII with regard to different TD processes, including qE-TD, were quantitatively estimated by the typical energy allocation models using transgenic rice in which psbS genes were silenced by RNA interference (RNAi). The silencing of psbS genes resulted in a decrease in the light-inducible portion of TD, whereas the allocation of energy to electron transport did not change over a wide range of light intensities. The allocation models indicate that the energy allocated to qE-TD under saturating light is 30-50%. We also showed that a large portion of absorbed light energy is thermally dissipated in manners that are independent of qE. The nature of such dissipations is discussed.
21914655	Flower development in rice.	2011	J Exp Bot	The flower of rice diverged from those of model eudicot species such as Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum, or Petunia, and is thus of great interest in developmental and evolutionary biology. Specific to grass species, including rice, are the structural units of the inflorescence called the spikelet and floret, which comprise grass-specific peripheral organs and conserved sexual organs. Recent advances in molecular genetic studies have provided an understanding of the functions of rapidly increasing numbers of genes involved in rice flower development. The genetic framework of rice flower development is in part similar to that of model eudicots. However, rice also probably recruits specific genetic mechanisms, which probably contribute to the establishment of the specific floral architecture of rice. In this review, the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice flowering are outlined, focusing on recent information and in comparison with those of model eudicots.
21910771	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1.	2012	Plant J	The temporal and spatial control of meristem identity is a key element in plant development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflorescence and flower architecture, we characterized the rice aberrant panicle organization 2 (apo2) mutant which exhibits small panicles with reduced number of primary branches due to the precocious formation of spikelet meristems. The apo2 mutants also display a shortened plastochron in the vegetative phase, late flowering, aberrant floral organ identities and loss of floral meristem determinacy. Map-based cloning revealed that APO2 is identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene. Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development. The present study revealed functional differences between APO2/RFL and LFY. In particular, APO2/RFL and LFY act oppositely on inflorescence development. Therefore, the genetic mechanisms for controlling inflorescence architecture have evolutionarily diverged between rice (monocots) and Arabidopsis (eudicots).
21947007	Control of flowering and storage organ formation in potato by FLOWERING LOCUS T.	2011	Nature	Seasonal fluctuations in day length regulate important aspects of plant development such as the flowering transition or, in potato (Solanum tuberosum), the formation of tubers. Day length is sensed by the leaves, which produce a mobile signal transported to the shoot apex or underground stems to induce a flowering transition or, respectively, a tuberization transition. Work in Arabidopsis, tomato and rice (Oryza sativa) identified the mobile FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein as a main component of the long-range 'florigen', or flowering hormone, signal. Here we show that expression of the Hd3a gene, the FT orthologue in rice, induces strict short-day potato types to tuberize in long days. Tuber induction is graft transmissible and the Hd3a-GFP protein is detected in the stolons of grafted plants, transport of the fusion protein thus correlating with tuber formation. We provide evidence showing that the potato floral and tuberization transitions are controlled by two different FT-like paralogues (StSP3D and StSP6A) that respond to independent environmental cues, and show that an autorelay mechanism involving CONSTANS modulates expression of the tuberization-control StSP6A gene.
22301968	Role of rice PPS in late vegetative and reproductive growth.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (pps-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering. Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of pps-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood. In the ninth leaf blade of pps-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type. Moreover, pps-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles. These phenotypes indicate that in pps-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles. Gibberellin is known to promote the juvenile-adult phase transition. d18-k is dwarf and has a prolonged juvenile phase. Double mutant (d18-k pps-1) showed the same phenotype as the pps-1, indicating that PPS is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes.
22476293	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway.	2012	Planta	Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence. They encode a cytochrome P450 protein CYP78A11 and an RNA-binding protein, respectively. Their homologs in Arabidopsis and maize are also associated with plant development/organ size. Despite the importance of PLA genes in plant development, their molecular functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated how PLA1 and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones. We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and PLA2 expression. GA induced PLA1 and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and PLA2 expression. In pla1-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings. GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and pla2. To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined. In GA-insensitive mutant, gid1 and less-sensitive mutant, Slr1-d1, PLA1 and PLA2 expression was down-regulated. On the other hand, the expression levels of PLA1 and PLA2 were highly enhanced in a GA-constitutive-active mutant, slr1-1, causing ectopic overexpression. These results indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.
22429711	The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity.	2012	Plant J	When the gibberellin (GA) receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) binds to GA, GID1 interacts with DELLA proteins, repressors of GA signaling. This interaction inhibits the suppressive function of DELLA protein and thereby activates the GA response. However, how DELLA proteins exert their suppressive function and how GID1s inhibit suppressive function of DELLA proteins is unclear. By yeast one-hybrid experiments and transient expression of the N-terminal region of rice DELLA protein (SLR1) in rice callus, we established that the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 possesses transactivation activity. When SLR1 proteins with various deletions were over-expressed in rice, the severity of dwarfism correlated with the transactivation activity observed in yeast, indicating that SLR1 suppresses plant growth through transactivation activity. This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA. The C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 also exhibits a suppressive function on plant growth, possibly by directly or indirectly interacting with the promoter region of target genes. Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of SLR1 has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with GID1 and transactivation activity.
22419825	Efficacy of microarray profiling data combined with QTL mapping for the identification of a QTL gene controlling the initial growth rate in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Seedling vigor, which is controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), is one of several important agronomic traits for direct-seedling rice systems. However, isolating these QTL genes is laborious and expensive. Here, we combined QTL mapping and microarray profiling to identify QTL genes for seedling vigor. By performing QTL mapping using 82 backcross inbred lines (BILs) of the Koshihikari (japonica) and Habataki (indica) cultivars for the rice initial growth, we identified two QTLs, early-stage plant development1/2 (qEPD1 and qEPD2), whose Koshihikari alleles promote plant height and/or leaf sheath length. Phenotypic analysis of the two substituted lines carrying the Habataki qEPD1 or qEPD2 allele revealed that qEPD2 functioned more dominantly for the initial growth of rice. From the microarray experiment, 55 and 45 candidate genes were found in the qEPD1 and qEPD2 genomic regions, which are expressed differentially between each substitution line (SL) and Koshihikari. Gibberellin 20 oxidase-2 (OsGA20ox2), which is identical to Semi Dwarf1 (SD1), was included among the 55 candidate genes of qEPD1, whereas its paralog, OsGA20ox1, was included among the 45 candidate genes of qEPD2. Consistently, introduction of the Koshihikari OsGA20ox1 allele into SL(qEPD2) increaseed its plant height and leaf sheath length significantly relative to the introduction of the Habataki OsGA20ox1 allele. Therefore, microarray profiling could be useful for rapidly screening QTL candidate genes. We concluded that OsGA20ox1 and OsGA20ox2 (SD1) function during the initial growth of rice, but OsGA20ox1 plays a dominant role in increasing plant height and leaf sheath length at the initial growth stage.
21952207	Heading date 1 (Hd1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS, is a possible target of human selection during domestication to diversify flowering times of cultivated rice.	2011	Genes Genet Syst	During the domestication of rice (Oryza sativa L.), diversification of flowering time was important in expanding the areas of cultivation. Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant and requires certain periods of dark to induce flowering. Heading date 1 (Hd1), a regulator of the florigen gene Hd3a, is one of the main factors used to generate diversity in flowering. Loss-of-function alleles of Hd1 are common in cultivated rice and cause the diversity of flowering time. However, it is unclear how these functional nucleotide polymorphisms of Hd1 accumulated in the course of evolution. Nucleotide polymorphisms within Hd1 and Hd3a were analyzed in 38 accessions of ancestral wild rice Oryza rufipogon and compared with those of cultivated rice. In contrast to cultivated rice, no nucleotide changes affecting Hd1 function were found in 38 accessions of wild rice ancestors. No functional changes were found in Hd3a in either cultivated or ancestral rice. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the Hd1 alleles may have occurred independently in cultivars descended from various accessions of ancestral rice. The non-functional Hd1 alleles found in cultivated rice may be selected during domestication, because they were not found or very rare in wild ancestral rice. In contrast with Hd3a, which has been highly conserved, Hd1 may have undergone human selection to diversify the flowering times of rice during domestication or the early stage of the cultivation period.
22574770	DWARF50 (D50), a rice (Oryza sativa L.) gene encoding inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, is required for proper development of intercalary meristem.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Rice internodes are vital for supporting high-yield panicles, which are controlled by various factors such as cell division, cell elongation and cell wall biosynthesis. Therefore, formation and regulation of the internode cell-producing intercalary meristem (IM) are important for determining the shape of internodes. To understand the regulation of internode development, we analysed a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf 50 (d50). Previously, we reported that parenchyma cells in the elongated internodes of d50 ectopically deposit cell wall phenolics. In this study, we revealed that D50 encodes putative inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase), which may be involved in phosphoinositide signalling required for many essential cellular functions, such as cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis and vesicular trafficking in eukaryotes. Analysis of the rice genome revealed 20 putative 5PTases including D50. The d50 mutation induced abnormally oriented cell division, irregular deposition of cell wall pectins and thick actin bundles in the parenchyma cells of the IM, resulting in abnormally organized cell files of the internode parenchyma and dwarf phenotype. Our results suggest that the putative 5PTase, encoded by D50, is essential for IM formation, including the direction of cell division, deposition of cell wall pectins and control of actin organization.
22476293	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway.	2012	Planta	Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence. They encode a cytochrome P450 protein CYP78A11 and an RNA-binding protein, respectively. Their homologs in Arabidopsis and maize are also associated with plant development/organ size. Despite the importance of PLA genes in plant development, their molecular functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated how PLA1 and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones. We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and PLA2 expression. GA induced PLA1 and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and PLA2 expression. In pla1-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings. GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and pla2. To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined. In GA-insensitive mutant, gid1 and less-sensitive mutant, Slr1-d1, PLA1 and PLA2 expression was down-regulated. On the other hand, the expression levels of PLA1 and PLA2 were highly enhanced in a GA-constitutive-active mutant, slr1-1, causing ectopic overexpression. These results indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.

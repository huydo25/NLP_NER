9275237	Expression of an ortholog of replication protein A1 (RPA1) is induced by gibberellin in deepwater rice.	1997	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Internodes of deepwater rice are induced to grow rapidly when plants become submerged. This adaptation enables deepwater rice to keep part of its foliage above the rising flood waters during the monsoon season and to avoid drowning. This growth response is, ultimately, elicited by the plant hormone gibberellin (GA). The primary target tissue for GA action is the intercalary meristem of the internode. Using differential display of mRNA, we have isolated a number of genes whose expression in the intercalary meristem is regulated by GA. The product of one of these genes was identified as an ortholog of replication protein A1 (RPA1). RPA is a heterotrimeric protein involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair and also in regulation of transcription. A chimeric construct, in which the single-stranded DNA-binding domain of rice RPA1 was spliced into the corresponding region of yeast RPA1, was able to complement a yeast rpa1 mutant. The transcript level of rice RPA1 is high in tissues containing dividing cells. RPA1 mRNA levels increase rapidly in the intercalary meristem during submergence and treatment with GA before the increase in the level of histone H3 mRNA, a marker for DNA replication.
11876823	Molecular diversity of phospholipase D in angiosperms.	2002	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The phospholipase D (PLD) family has been identified in plants by recent molecular studies, fostered by the emerging importance of plant PLDs in stress physiology and signal transduction. However, the presence of multiple isoforms limits the power of conventional biochemical and pharmacological approaches, and calls for a wider application of genetic methodology.

RESULTS: Taking advantage of sequence data available in public databases, we attempted to provide a prerequisite for such an approach. We made a complete inventory of the Arabidopsis thaliana PLD family, which was found to comprise 12 distinct genes. The current nomenclature of Arabidopsis PLDs was refined and expanded to include five newly described genes. To assess the degree of plant PLD diversity beyond Arabidopsis we explored data from rice (including the genome draft by Monsanto) as well as cDNA and EST sequences from several other plants. Our analysis revealed two major PLD subfamilies in plants. The first, designated C2-PLD, is characterised by presence of the C2 domain and comprises previously known plant PLDs as well as new isoforms with possibly unusual features catalytically inactive or independent on Ca2+. The second subfamily (denoted PXPH-PLD) is novel in plants but is related to animal and fungal enzymes possessing the PX and PH domains.

CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary dynamics, and inter-specific diversity, of plant PLDs inferred from our phylogenetic analysis, call for more plant species to be employed in PLD research. This will enable us to obtain generally valid conclusions.
7764623	Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated.	1994	Planta	We have characterized several heat-shock-induced genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and compared their expression under a variety of conditions. Three of these genes, which are analogs of the hsp82/90 family, lie within a cloned 18-kilobase (kb) region of the genome. The middle member of this cluster, designated hsp82B, has been fully sequenced. The gene uses a promoter containing six putative heat-shock elements as well as several unusual sequence motifs including a stretch of 11 thymidines alternating with 11 adenosines. The mRNA for this gene reaches its highest relative level of expression within 120 min after plants are shifted to 42 degrees C; no other conditions induce this gene. By contrast, we found that during heat stress the expression of hsp70 correlates well with increases in internal ion concentrations, and can also be induced by excess salt or ethanol at normal growth temperatures. These results appear to indicate that whereas hsp70 is induced by all stresses that lead to protein denaturation-including heat stress-HSP82 mRNA accumulates only upon heat stress.

9687064	Molecular cloning and expression characterization of a rice K+ channel beta subunit.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	K+ channel proteins native to animal membranes have been shown to be composed of two different types of polypeptides: the pore-forming alpha subunit and the beta subunit which may be involved in either modulation of conductance through the channel, or stabilization and surface expression of the channel complex. Several cDNAs encoding animal K+ channel beta subunits have been recently cloned and sequenced. We report the molecular cloning of a rice plant homolog of these animal beta subunits. The rice cDNA (KOB1) described in this report encodes a 36 kDa polypeptide which shares 45% sequence identity with these animal K+ channel beta subunits. and 72% identity with the only other cloned plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) K+ channel beta subunit (KAB1). The KOB1 translation product was demonstrated to form a tight physical association with a plant K+ channel alpha subunit. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the KOB1 cDNA encodes a K+ channel beta subunit. Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots. Later-developing leaves on a rice plant were found to contain increasing levels of the protein with the flag leaf having the highest titer of KOB1. Leaf sheaths are known to accumulate excess K+ and act as reserve sources of this cation when new growth requires remobilization of K+. Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves. It was further determined that when K+ was lost from older leaves of plants grown on K+-deficient fertilizer, the loss of cellular K+ was associated with a decline in both KOB1 mRNA and protein. This finding represents the first demonstration (in either plants or animals) that changes in cellular K+ status may specifically alter expression of a gene encoding a K+ channel subunit.
9843485	RPE, a plant gene involved in early developmental steps of nematode feeding cells.	1998	EMBO J	Sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes are able to induce the redifferentiation of root cells into multinucleate nematode feeding sites (NFSs). We have isolated by promoter trapping an Arabidopsis thaliana gene that is essential for the early steps of NFS formation induced by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Its pattern of expression is similar to that of key regulators of the cell cycle, but it is not observed with the cyst nematode. Later in NFS development, this gene is induced by both root-knot and cyst nematodes. It encodes a protein similar to the D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPE) (EC 5.1.3.1), a key enzyme in the reductive Calvin cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). Quantitative RT-PCR showed the accumulation of RPE transcripts in potato, as in Arabidopsis NFS. Homozygous rpe plants have a germination mutant phenotype that can be rescued in dwarf plants on sucrose-supplemented medium. During root development, this gene is expressed in the meristems and initiation sites of lateral roots. These results suggest that the genetic control of NFSs and the first stages of meristem formation share common steps and confirms the previous cytological observations which indicate that root cells undergo metabolic reprogramming when they turn into NFSs.

12447439	Sequence and analysis of rice chromosome 4.	2002	Nature	Rice is the principal food for over half of the population of the world. With its genome size of 430 megabase pairs (Mb), the cultivated rice species Oryza sativa is a model plant for genome research. Here we report the sequence analysis of chromosome 4 of O. sativa, one of the first two rice chromosomes to be sequenced completely. The finished sequence spans 34.6 Mb and represents 97.3% of the chromosome. In addition, we report the longest known sequence for a plant centromere, a completely sequenced contig of 1.16 Mb corresponding to the centromeric region of chromosome 4. We predict 4,658 protein coding genes and 70 transfer RNA genes. A total of 1,681 predicted genes match available unique rice expressed sequence tags. Transposable elements have a pronounced bias towards the euchromatic regions, indicating a close correlation of their distributions to genes along the chromosome. Comparative genome analysis between cultivated rice subspecies shows that there is an overall syntenic relationship between the chromosomes and divergence at the level of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions and deletions. By contrast, there is little conservation in gene order between rice and Arabidopsis.
11756687	Mariner-like transposases are widespread and diverse in flowering plants.	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Complete and partial sequences of mariner-like elements (MLEs) have been reported for hundreds of species of animals, but only two have been identified in plants. On the basis of these two plant MLEs and several related sequences identified by database searches, plant-specific degenerate primers were derived and used to amplify a conserved region of MLE transposase genes from a variety of plant genomes. Positive products were obtained for 6 dicots and 31 monocots of 54 plant species tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 68 distinct MLE transposase sequences from 25 grass species is consistent with vertical transmission and rapid diversification of multiple lineages of transposases. Surprisingly, the evolution of MLEs in grasses was accompanied by repeated and independent acquisition of introns in a localized region of the transposase gene.
10393983	High gene density is conserved at syntenic loci of small and large grass genomes.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Comparative genomic analysis at the genetic-map level has shown extensive conservation of the gene order between the different grass genomes in many chromosomal regions. However, little is known about the gene organization in grass genomes at the microlevel. Comparison of gene-coding regions between maize, rice, and sorghum showed that the distance between the genes is correlated with the genome size. We have investigated the microcolinearity at Lrk gene loci in the genomes of four grass species: wheat, barley, maize, and rice. The Lrk genes, which encode receptor-like kinases, were found to be consistently associated with another type of receptor-like kinase (Tak) on chromosome groups 1 and 3 in Triticeae and on chromosomes homoeologous to Triticeae group 3 in the other grass genomes. On Triticeae chromosome group 1, Tak and Lrk together with genes putatively encoding NBS/LRR proteins form a cluster of genes possibly involved in signal transduction. Comparison of the gene composition at orthologous Lrk loci in wheat, barley, and rice revealed a maximal gene density of one gene per 4-5 kb, very similar to the gene density in Arabidopsis thaliana. We conclude that small and large grass genomes contain regions that are highly enriched in genes with very little or no repetitive DNA. The comparison of the gene organization suggested various genome rearrangements during the evolution of the different grass species.
8041700	The superoxide dismutase molecular clock revisited.	1994	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) was examined earlier and found to behave in a very unclock-like manner despite (accepted point mutation, or PAM) corrections for multiple replacements per site. Depending upon the time span involved, rates could differ 5-fold. We have sought to determine whether the data might be clock-like if a covarion model were used. We first determined that the number of concomitantly variable codons (covarions) in SOD is 28. With that value fixed we found that the observations for SOD could fit reasonably well a molecular clock if, given 28 covarions, (i) there are approximately six replacements every 10 million years, (ii) the total number of codons is 162, (iii) the number of codons that are permanently invariable across the range of taxa from fungi to mammals is 44, and (iv) the persistence of variability is quite low (0.01). Thus, the inconsistent number of amino acid differences between various pairs of descendent sequences could well be the result of a fairly accurate molecular clock. The general conclusion has two sides: (i) the inference that a given gene is a bad clock may sometimes arise through a failure to take all the relevant biology into account and (ii) one should examine the possibility that different subsets of amino acids are evolving at different rates, because otherwise the assumption of a clock may yield erroneous estimates of divergence times on the basis of the observed number of amino acid differences.
10469647	GIGANTEA: a circadian clock-controlled gene that regulates photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis and encodes a protein with several possible membrane-spanning domains.	1999	EMBO J	Flowering of Arabidopsis is promoted by long days and delayed by short days. Mutations in the GIGANTEA (GI) gene delay flowering under long days but have little or no effect under short days. We have now isolated the GI gene and show that it encodes a novel, putative membrane protein. By comparing the sequence of the Arabidopsis gene with that of a likely rice orthologue and by sequencing mutant alleles, we identify regions of the GI protein that are likely to be important for its function. We show that GI expression is regulated by the circadian clock with a peak in transcript levels 8-10 h after dawn. The timing, height and duration of this peak are influenced by daylength. We analysed the interactions between GI and the LHY, CCA1 and ELF3 genes, previously shown to affect daylength responses; we show that the rhythmic pattern of GI expression is altered in the elf3, CCA1-OX and lhy genotypes, and that CCA1 and LHY expression are reduced by gi mutations. Our results are consistent with the idea that GI plays an important role in regulating the expression of flowering time genes during the promotion of flowering by photoperiod.
9747848	Use of alternate splice sites in granule-bound starch synthase mRNA from low-amylose rice varieties.	1998	Plant Mol Biol	The rice Waxy gene encodes a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) necessary for the synthesis of amylose in endosperm tissue. We have previously shown that a CT microsatellite near the transcriptional start site of the GBSS gene can distinguish 7 alleles that accounted for more than 80% of the variation in apparent amylose content in an extended pedigree of 89 US rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.). Furthermore, all the cultivars with 18% or less amylose were shown to have the sequence AGTTATA at the putative leader intron 5' splice site, while all cultivars with a higher proportion of amylose had AGGTATA. Here we demonstrate that this single-base mutation reduces the efficiency of GBSS pre-mRNA processing and results in alternate splicing at three cryptic sites. The predominant 5' splice site in CT18 low-amylose varieties is 93 bp upstream of the splice site used in intermediate and high amylose varieties and is immediately 5' to the CT microsatellite that we previously demonstrated to be tightly correlated with amylose content. Use of the leader intron 5' splice site at either -93 or -1 in conjunction with the predominant 3' splice site results in formation of a small open reading frame 38 bp upstream of the normal ATG and out of frame with it. This open reading frame is not produced when any of the 5' leader intron splice sites are used in conjunction with an alternate 3' splice site five bases further downstream which was observed in all rice varieties tested.
11139406	Characterization of monocot and dicot plant S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase gene families including identification in the mRNA of a highly conserved pair of upstream overlapping open reading frames.	2001	Biochem J	S-Adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC; EC 4.1.1.50) is one of the key regulatory enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Isolation of genomic and cDNA sequences from rice and Arabidopsis had indicated that this enzyme is encoded by a small multigene family in monocot and dicot plants. Analysis of rice, maize and Arabidopsis AdoMetDC cDNA species revealed that the monocot enzyme possesses an extended C-terminus relative to dicot and human enzymes. Interestingly, we discovered that all expressed plant AdoMetDC mRNA 5' leader sequences contain a highly conserved pair of overlapping upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that overlap by one base. The 5' tiny uORF consists of two or three codons and the 3' small uORF encodes 50-54 residues. Sequences of the small uORFs are highly conserved between monocot, dicot and gymnosperm AdoMetDC mRNA species and the C-terminus of the plant small uORFs is conserved with the C-terminus of nematode AdoMetDC uORFs; such a conserved arrangement is strongly suggestive of a translational regulatory mechanism. No introns were found in the main AdoMetDC proenzyme ORF from any of the plant genes encoding AdoMetDC, whereas introns were found in conserved positions flanking the overlapping uORFs. The absence of the furthest 3' intron from the Arabidopsis gene encoding AdoMetDC2 suggests that this intron was lost recently. Reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR analysis of the two Arabidopsis genes for AdoMetDC indicated that AdoMetDC1 is abundant and ubiquitous, whereas the gene for AdoMetDC2 is expressed preferentially in leaves and inflorescences. Investigation of recently released Arabidopsis genome sequences has revealed that in addition to the two genes encoding AdoMetDC isolated as part of the present work, four additional genes are present in Arabidopsis but they are probably not expressed.
9748665	Genomic DNA sequence of a rice gene coding for a pullulanase-type of starch debranching enzyme.	1998	Biochim Biophys Acta	A genomic DNA containing a rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Norin-8) gene coding for a pullulanase-type starch debranching enzyme (EC 3.2.1. 41) was sequenced (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number AB012915). Along the 15, 248 bp DNA, the pullulanase gene is split into 26 exons. The four pullulanase consensus regions are positioned in the middle portion of the sequence and are separated by long introns and 1-3 exons. Comparison of the rice cv. Norin-8 pullulanase genomic structure with that of barley pullulanase (limit dextrinase) (F. Lok et al., EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number AF022725) indicates that most of the pullulanase exons are highly conserved. Alignment of the nucleotide bases of rice exon 8 with those of barley exon 8-intron 8-exon 9 fragment suggests that the 85 bp internal sequence of rice exon 8 was originally an intron, a possibility further indicated by the absence in barley and spinach (A. Renz et al., EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number X83969) pullulanases of amino acid residues encoded by the 85 bp fragment.
8550584	Novel plant Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed in response to abscisic acid and osmotic stress.	1996	J Biol Chem	A cDNA corresponding to an mRNA which accumulates in germinating rice seeds in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid was isolated by differential hybridization. Northern blotting indicated that the mRNA also accumulates in vegetative tissues in response to treatment with abscisic acid and to osmotic stress. Sequencing identified a major open reading frame encoding a novel protein of 27.4 kDa. The identity of the open reading frame was confirmed by comparing the translation products of cellular, hybrid-selected, and in vitro transcribed RNAs and by immunoprecipitation. Western blotting of cellular extracts indicated that the protein is associated with microsomal or membrane fractions. Data base searches indicated that it contains a conserved Ca(2+)-binding, EF-hand motif and that related proteins are similarly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. A fusion protein purified from Escherichia coli containing the putative EF-hand region was shown to bind Ca2+ in blot binding assays. These data identify a novel gene family encoding proteins involved in the response of plants to abscisic acid and osmotic stress.
11114160	Negative regulation of defense responses in plants by a conserved MAPKK kinase.	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The enhanced disease resistance 1 (edr1) mutation of Arabidopsis confers resistance to powdery mildew disease caused by the fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum. Resistance mediated by the edr1 mutation is correlated with induction of several defense responses, including host cell death. Double mutant analysis revealed that all edr1-associated phenotypes are suppressed by mutations that block salicylic acid (SA) perception (nim1) or reduce SA production (pad4 and eds1). The NahG transgene, which lowers endogenous SA levels, also suppressed edr1. In contrast, the ein2 mutation did not suppress edr1-mediated resistance and associated phenotypes, indicating that ethylene and jasmonic acid-induced responses are not required for edr1 resistance. The EDR1 gene was isolated by positional cloning and was found to encode a putative MAP kinase kinase kinase similar to CTR1, a negative regulator of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these data suggest that EDR1 functions at the top of a MAP kinase cascade that negatively regulates SA-inducible defense responses. Putative orthologs of EDR1 are present in monocots such as rice and barley, indicating that EDR1 may regulate defense responses in a wide range of crop species.
15803319	Identification of an active transposon in intact rice plants.	2005	Mol Genet Genomics	A transposable element that is active in intact plants has been identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The 607-bp element itself, termed nonautonomous DNA-based active rice transposon (nDart), has no coding capacity. It was found inserted in the gene encoding Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase in a chlorophyll-deficient albino mutant isolated from backcross progeny derived from a cross between wild-type japonica varieties. The nDart has 19-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and, when mobilized, generates an 8-bp target-site duplication (TSD). At least 13 nDart elements were identified in the genome sequence of the japonica cultivar Nipponbare. Database searches identified larger elements, termed DNA-based active rice transposon (Dart) that contained one ORF for a protein that contains a region with high similarity to the hAT dimerization motif. Dart shares several features with nDart, including identical TIRs, similar subterminal sequences and the generation of an 8-bp TSD. These shared features indicate that the nonautonomous element nDart is an internal deletion derivative of the autonomous element Dart. We conclude that these active transposon systems belong to the hAT superfamily of class II transposons. Because the transposons are active in intact rice plants, they should be useful tools for tagging genes in studies of functional genomics.
10377457	Suppression of the heterotrimeric G protein causes abnormal morphology, including dwarfism, in rice.	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transgenic rice containing an antisense cDNA for the alpha subunit of rice heterotrimeric G protein produced little or no mRNA for the subunit and exhibited abnormal morphology, including dwarf traits and the setting of small seeds. In normal rice, the mRNA for the alpha subunit was abundant in the internodes and florets, the tissues closely related to abnormality in the dwarf transformants. The position of the alpha-subunit gene was mapped on rice chromosome 5 by mapping with the restriction fragment length polymorphism. The position was closely linked to the locus of a rice dwarf mutant, Daikoku dwarf (d-1), which is known to exhibit abnormal phenotypes similar to those of the transformants that suppressed the endogenous mRNA for the alpha subunit by antisense technology. Analysis of the cDNAs for the alpha subunits of five alleles of Daikoku dwarf (d-1), ID-1, DK22, DKT-1, DKT-2, and CM1361-1, showed that these dwarf mutants had mutated in the coding region of the alpha-subunit gene. These results show that the G protein functions in the formation of normal internodes and seeds in rice.
10333591	Purification, characterization, and cDNA structure of isoamylase from developing endosperm of rice.	1999	Planta	Isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was efficiently purified within a day to homogeneity, as confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), from developing endosperm by sequential use of Q Sepharose HP anion-exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and TSKgel G4000SWXL and G3000SWXL gel filtration chromatography. Although the protein exhibited a molecular size of ca. 83 kDa on SDS-PAGE, the apparent size of the native enzyme was approximately 340 and 490 kDa on TSKgel G3000SWXL and G4000SWXL gel filtration chromatograms, respectively, suggesting that rice isoamylase exists in a homo-tetramer to homo-hexamer form in developing endosperm. The purified rice isoamylase was able to debranch glycogen, phytoglycogen and amylopectin but could not attack pullulan. The optimum pH and temperature for isoamylase activity were found to be pH 6.5 to 7.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by HgCl2 and p-chloromercuribenzoate at 1 mM. These results indicate that rice isoamylase possesses properties which are distinct from those reported for bacterial isoamylase. Complementary-DNA clones for rice endosperm isoamylase were isolated with a polymerase-chain-reaction product as probe which was generated by primers designed from nucleotides conserved in cDNA for maize Sugary-1 isoamylase (M.G. James et al., 1995. Plant Cell 7: 417-429) and a Pseudomonas amyloderamosa gene encoding isoamylase (A. Amemura et al. 1988, J Biol Chem 263: 9271-9275). The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the longest clone showed a high similarity to those of maize Surgary-1 isoamylase, but a lesser similarity to those of Pseudomonas amyloderamosa isoamylase. Southern blot analysis and gene mapping analysis indicated that the isoamylase gene exists as a single copy in the rice genome and is located on chromosome 8 of cv. Nipponbare which belongs to the Japonica rice group. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that isoamylases from maize and rice are more closely related to a number of glgX gene products of the blue green alga Synechocystis and various bacteria than to isoamylases from Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium. Hence, it is proposed that glgX proteins are classified as isoamylase-type debranching enzymes. Our tree also showed that all starch- and glycogen-debranching enzymes from plants and bacteria tested can be classified into two distinct types, an isoamylase-type and a pullulanase-type.
10395929	Molecular cloning and expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger gene in Oryza sativa.	1999	Biochim Biophys Acta	Na+/H+ exchanger catalyzes the countertransport of Na+ and H+ across membranes. We isolated a rice cDNA clone the deduced amino acid sequence of which had homology with a putative Na+/H+ exchanger in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NHX1. The sequence contains 2330 bp with an open reading frame of 1608 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to that of NHX1 and NHE isoforms in mammals, and shares high similarity with the sequences within predicted transmembrane segments and an amiloride-binding domain. The expression of the gene was increased by salt stress. These results suggest that the product of the novel gene, OsNHX1, functions as a Na+/H+ exchanger, and plays important roles in salt tolerance of rice.
8490131	Enigmatic double-stranded RNA in Japonica rice.	1993	Plant Mol Biol	We have found a linear, 16 kb, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in symptomless Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) that is not found in Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.). The dsRNA was detected in every tissue and at every developmental stage, and its copy number was approximately constant (about 20 copies/cell). Double-stranded RNA was also detected in two strains of Oryza rufipogon (an ancestor of O. sativa). Hybridization experiments indicated that the dsRNA of O. rufipogon was homologous but not identical to that of O. sativa. The sequence of about 13.2 kb of the dsRNA was determined and two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. The larger ORF (ORF B) was more than 12,351 nucleotides long and encoded more than 4,117 amino acid residues.
7629126	The unusual structure of a novel RNA replicon in rice.	1995	J Biol Chem	A linear, plasmid-like, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was isolated from rice, and its entire sequence of 13,952 nucleotides (nt) was determined. The dsRNA encodes a single, unusually long, open reading frame (13,716 nt, 4,572 amino acid residues), which includes an RNA helicase-like domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like domain. A series of Northern hybridization and primer extension experiments revealed that the coding (sense) strand of the dsRNA contains a discontinuity (nick) at a position 1,211 nt (or 1,256 nt) from the 5' end. This discontinuity divides not only the coding strand of dsRNA molecule into a 1,211-nt fragment and a 12,741-nt fragment (or a 1,256-nt fragment and a 12,696-nt fragment) but also divides the long open reading frame into a 5' part of 1,045 nt (348 amino acid residues) and a 3' part of 12,671 nt (4,224 amino acid residues) or a 5' part of 1,090 nt (363 amino acid residues) and a 3' part of 12,626 nt (4,209 amino acid residues). It seems likely that almost all dsRNA molecules in rice plants contain such a discontinuity. This rice dsRNA appears to be a novel and unique RNA replicon.
7909914	Rapid conversion of rDNA intergenic spacer of diploid mutants of rice derived from gamma-ray irradiated tetraploids.	1994	Mol Gen Genet	The organization of tandemly repeated sequences of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in rice mutants derived from gamma-irradiated tetraploids was analyzed. Southern hybridization analysis of nuclear DNA revealed that most of the intergenic spacers (IGSs) in mutant rDNA are replaced concertedly by new molecular species. The new IGSs are produced by the amplification of a subrepeat of about 250 bp. Results obtained from sequence analyses indicate that various intermediate molecular species of the subrepeat were formed during structuring of the IGS region and that many rearrangements occurred between them. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of recurrent irradiation of tetraploids for inducing artificial genome rearrangement, and also indicate the extreme plasticity and variability of genome structure in plants.
12602891	OsSEND-1: a new RAD2 nuclease family member in higher plants.	2003	Plant Mol Biol	A novel endonuclease, a new member of the RAD2 nuclease family, has been identified from the higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare), and designated as OsSEND-1. The open reading frame of the OsSEND-1 cDNA encoded a predicted product of 641 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 69.9 kDa. The encoded protein showed a relatively high degree of sequence homology with the RAD2 nuclease family proteins, especially RAD2 nuclease, but it differed markedly from FEN-1, XPG or HEX1/EXO1. The N- and I-domains in the family were highly conserved in the OsSEND-1 sequence. The protein was much smaller than XPG, but larger than HEX1/EXO1 and FEN-1. The genome sequence was composed of 14 exons, and was localized at the almost terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 8. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated preferential expression of OsSEND-1 mRNA in proliferating tissues such as meristem. The mRNA level of OsSEND-1 was induced by UV and DNA-damaging agent such as MMS or H2O2, indicating that OsSEND-1 has some roles in the repair of many types of damaged DNA. The recombinant peptide showed endonuclease activity.
8204833	Nucleotide sequence of a rice cDNA similar to a maize NADP-dependent malic enzyme.	1994	Plant Mol Biol	We have isolated a rice cDNA clone that is homologous to the gene for the maize NADP-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40; NADP-ME). The deduced amino acid sequence coded for by the cDNA indicates a high level of homology to chloroplast type NADP-ME, including a transit peptide with pronounced hydrophobic properties at the amino terminus. Northern blot analysis indicates that the expression of this gene is regulated by external stress such as submergence.
15247400	Gene duplication in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway preceded evolution of the grasses.	2004	Plant Physiol	Despite ongoing research on carotenoid biosynthesis in model organisms, there is a paucity of information on pathway regulation operating in the grasses (Poaceae), which include plants of world-wide agronomic importance. As a result, efforts to either breed for or metabolically engineer improvements in carotenoid content or composition in cereal crops have led to unexpected results. In comparison to maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) accumulates no endosperm carotenoids, despite having a functional pathway in chloroplasts. To better understand why these two related grasses differ in endosperm carotenoid content, we began to characterize genes encoding phytoene synthase (PSY), since this nuclear-encoded enzyme appeared to catalyze a rate-controlling step in the plastid-localized biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme had been previously associated with the maize Y1 locus thought to be the only functional gene controlling PSY accumulation, though function of the Y1 gene product had never been demonstrated. We show that both maize and rice possess and express products from duplicate PSY genes, PSY1 (Y1) and PSY2; PSY1 transcript accumulation correlates with carotenoid-containing endosperm. Using a heterologous bacterial system, we demonstrate enzyme function of PSY1 and PSY2 that are largely conserved in sequence except for N- and C-terminal domains. By database mining and use of ortholog-specific universal PCR primers, we found that the PSY duplication is prevalent in at least eight subfamilies of the Poaceae, suggesting that this duplication event preceded evolution of the Poaceae. These findings will impact study of grass phylogeny and breeding of enhanced carotenoid content in an entire taxonomic group of plant crops critical for global food security.

22270358	Regulation of a proteinaceous elicitor-induced Ca2+ influx and production of phytoalexins by a putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1, in cultured rice cells.	2012	J Biol Chem	Pathogen/microbe- or plant-derived signaling molecules (PAMPs/MAMPs/DAMPs) or elicitors induce increases in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca(2+) followed by a series of defense responses including biosynthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites called phytoalexins; however, the molecular links and regulatory mechanisms of the phytoalexin biosynthesis remains largely unknown. A putative voltage-gated cation channel, OsTPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells. Here we show that TvX induced a prolonged increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), mainly due to a Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane. Membrane fractionation by two-phase partitioning and immunoblot analyses revealed that OsTPC1 is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane. In retrotransposon-insertional Ostpc1 knock-out cell lines harboring a Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin, TvX-induced Ca(2+) elevation was significantly impaired, which was restored by expression of OsTPC1. TvX-induced production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins and the expression of a series of diterpene cyclase genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis were also impaired in the Ostpc1 cells. Whole cell patch clamp analyses of OsTPC1 heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells showed its voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-permeability. These results suggest that OsTPC1 plays a crucial role in TvX-induced Ca(2+) influx as a plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channel consequently required for the regulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells.
22267486	Effector-mediated suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for rice blast disease.	2012	Plant Cell	Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.
22168839	RNA targeting to a specific ER sub-domain is required for efficient transport and packaging of α-globulins to the protein storage vacuole in developing rice endosperm.	2012	Plant J	Studies focusing on the targeting of RNAs that encode rice storage proteins, prolamines and glutelins to specific sub-domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as mis-localization studies of other storage protein RNAs, indicate a close relationship between the ER site of RNA translation and the final site of protein deposition in the endomembrane system in developing rice endosperm. In addition to prolamine and glutelin, rice accumulates smaller amounts of α-globulins, which are deposited together with glutelin in the protein storage vacuole (PSV). In situ RT-PCR analysis revealed that α-globulin RNAs are not distributed to the cisternal ER as expected for a PSV-localized protein, but instead are targeted to the protein body-ER (PB-ER) by a regulated process requiring cis-sorting sequences. Sequence alignments with putative maize δ-zein cis-localization elements identified several candidate regulatory sequences that may be responsible for PB-ER targeting. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of α-globulin on the periphery of the prolamine protein bodies and packaging in Golgi-associated dense vesicles, as well as deposition and storage within peripheral regions of the PSV. Mis-targeting of α-globulin RNAs to the cisternal ER dramatically alters the spatial arrangement of α-globulin and glutelin within the PSV, with the accompanying presence of numerous small α-globulin particles in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that α-globulin RNA targeting to the PB-ER sub-domain is essential for efficient transport of α-globulins to the PSV and its spatial arrangement in the PSV. Such RNA localization prevents potential deleterious protein-protein interactions, in addition to performing a role in protein targeting.
22306743	Expression of an Acidothermus cellulolyticus endoglucanase in transgenic rice seeds.	2012	Protein Expr Purif	The thermostable endo-1,4-β-glucanase (E1) from Acidothermus cellulolyticus, is a useful enzyme for commercial hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose. A codon-optimized synthetic gene encoding this enzyme was transformed into rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) under the control of the rice seed storage protein Gt1 promoter. The transgenic line C19 was identified as the one with the highest endoglucanase activity among the total of 36 independent transgenic lines obtained. The cellulase activity in the C19 seeds was estimated at about 830U/g of dried seeds using CMC as substrate. The enzymes produced in the seeds had an optimum pH of 5.0 and optimum temperature of 80°C, which is similar to the enzymes produced by the native bacterium host. This study demonstrates that the transgenic rice seeds could be used as a bioreactor for production of enzymes for cellulosic biomass conversion.
22500165	Chromosomal Location of HCA1 and HCA2, Hybrid Chlorosis Genes in Rice.	2012	Int J Plant Genomics	MANY POSTZYGOTIC REPRODUCTIVE BARRIER FORMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PLANTS: hybrid weakness, hybrid necrosis, and hybrid chlorosis. In this study, linkage analysis of the genes causing hybrid chlorosis in F(2) generation in rice, HCA1 and HCA2, was performed. HCA1 and HCA2 are located respectively on the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 11. These regions are known to be highly conserved as a duplicated chromosomal segment. The molecular mechanism causing F(2) chlorosis deduced from the location of the two genes was discussed. The possibility of the introgression of the chromosomal segments encompassing HCA1 and/or HCA2 was also discussed from the viewpoint of Indica-Japonica differentiation.
22136623	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice.	2012	Plant J	Methylation of histone lysine residues plays an essential role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Enzymes involved in establishment of the repressive H3K9 and H3K27 methylation marks have been previously characterized, but the deposition and function of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation remain uncharacterized in rice. Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds. These defects resemble the phenotypes previously described for some brassinosteroid-knockdown mutants. Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that levels of H3K36me2/3 are reduced in chromatin at some regions of these brassinosteroid-related genes in SDG725 knockdown plants, and that SDG725 protein is able to directly bind to these target genes. Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development.
22489119	Major phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity and antidiabetic potential of rice bean (Vigna umbellata L.) in China.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	Interest in edible beans as nutraceuticals is increasing. In the present study, the individual phenolic acids, the total phenolic content (TPC), the total flavonoid content (TFC), and the antioxidant and antidiabetic potential of 13 varieties of rice beans from China were investigated. Eight phenolic compounds (catechin, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vitexin, isovitexin, sinapic acid, quercetin) were analyzed on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) mass spectrometry (MS) system. The rice bean varieties had significant differences in total phenolic compounds (ranging from 123.09 ± 10.35 to 843.75 ± 30.15 μg/g), in TPC (ranging from 3.27 ± 0.04 to 6.43 ± 0.25 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g), in TFC (ranging from 55.95 ± 11.16 to 320.39 ± 31.77 mg catechin (CE)/g), in antioxidant activity (ranging from 39.87 ± 1.37 to 46.40 ± 2.18 μM·TE/g), in α-glucosidase inhibition activity (ranging from 44.32 ± 2.12 to 68.71 ± 2.19) and in advanced glycation end products formation inhibition activity (ranging from 34.11 ± 0.59 to 75.75 ± 0.33). This study is the first report on phytochemistry and biological activities in rice beans.
22236520	Proteomics analysis reveals multiple regulatory mechanisms in response to selenium in rice.	2012	J Proteomics	Selenium (Se) shows both beneficial and toxic effects on plant growth. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings cultivated under lower concentrations of sodium selenite showed enhanced growth, whereas higher concentrations of sodium selenite repressed seedling growth. To acquire detailed regulatory mechanisms underlying these effects, a comparative proteomics study using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS was performed. By comparison of gel images between Se treatments and control, 66 and 97 differentially expressed proteins were identified in shoot and root, respectively under at least one of the Se treatment concentrations. Gene Ontology and Clustering analysis reveal primary metabolism, photosynthesis and redox homeostasis are the most highly affected biological processes by Se treatments. Lower Se treatments (2 and 6 mg/L sodium selenite) activated antioxidative system, enhanced photosynthesis and primary metabolism. However, higher Se treatment (10mg/L sodium selenite) damaged photosynthesis apparatus, inhibited photosynthesis and primary metabolism. Protein ubiquitination and phosphorylation may also play important roles in Se response in rice. In conclusion, our study provided novel insights into Se response in rice at the proteome level, which are expected to be highly useful for dissecting the Se response pathways in higher plants and for producing Se enriched rice cultivars in the future.
22218673	Gene silencing using the recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13 as a new paradigm in plant breeding.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Resistant germplasm resources are valuable for developing resistant varieties in agricultural production. However, recessive resistance genes are usually overlooked in hybrid breeding. Compared with dominant traits, however, they may confer resistance to different pathogenic races or pest biotypes with different mechanisms of action. The recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13, also involved in pollen development, has been cloned and its resistance mechanism has been recently characterized. This report describes the conversion of bacterial blight resistance mediated by the recessive xa13 gene into a dominant trait to facilitate its use in a breeding program. This was achieved by knockdown of the corresponding dominant allele Xa13 in transgenic rice using recently developed artificial microRNA technology. Tissue-specific promoters were used to exclude most of the expression of artificial microRNA in the anther to ensure that Xa13 functioned normally during pollen development. A battery of highly bacterial blight resistant transgenic plants with normal seed setting rates were acquired, indicating that highly specific gene silencing had been achieved. Our success with xa13 provides a paradigm that can be adapted to other recessive resistance genes.
22215564	Safety assessment of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis rice T1c-19 in Sprague-Dawley rats from metabonomics and bacterial profile perspectives.	2012	IUBMB Life	Bacillus thuringiensis rice is facing commercialization as the main food source in the near future. The unintended effects of genetically modified (GM) organisms are the most important barriers to their promotion. We aimed to establish a new in vivo evaluation model for genetically modified foods by using metabonomics and bacterial profile approaches. T1c-19 rice flour or its transgenic parent MH63 was used at 70% wt/wt to produce diets that were fed to rats for ∼ 90 days. Urine metabolite changes were detected using (1)H NMR. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the bacterial profiles between the two groups. The metabonomics was analyzed for metabolite changes in rat urine, when compared with the non-GM rice group, where rats were fed a GM rice diet. Several metabolites correlated with rat age and sex but not with GM rice diet. Significant biological differences were not identified between the GM rice diet and the non-GM rice diet. The bacteria related to rat urine metabolites were also discussed. The results from metabonomics and bacterial profile analyses were comparable with the results attained using the traditional method. Because metabonomics and bacterial profiling offer noninvasive, dynamic approaches for monitoring food safety, they provide a novel process for assessing the safety of GM foods.
22313362	The broad-leaf herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid turns rice into a living trap for a major insect pest and a parasitic wasp.	2012	New Phytol	Synthetic chemical elicitors of plant defense have been touted as a powerful means for sustainable crop protection. Yet, they have never been successfully applied to control insect pests in the field. We developed a high-throughput chemical genetics screening system based on a herbivore-induced linalool synthase promoter fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter construct to test synthetic compounds for their potential to induce rice defenses. We identified 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), an auxin homolog and widely used herbicide in monocotyledonous crops, as a potent elicitor of rice defenses. Low doses of 2,4-D induced a strong defensive reaction upstream of the jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways, resulting in a marked increase in trypsin proteinase inhibitor activity and volatile production. Induced plants were more resistant to the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis, but became highly attractive to the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens and its main egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae. In a field experiment, 2,4-D application turned rice plants into living traps for N. lugens by attracting parasitoids. Our findings demonstrate the potential of auxin homologs as defensive signals and show the potential of the herbicide to turn rice into a selective catch crop for an economically important pest.
22350764	Members of rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily are involved in arsenite permeability and tolerance in plants.	2012	Transgenic Res	Rice accumulates high level of arsenic (As) in its edible parts and thus plays an important role in the transfer of As into the food chain. However, the mechanisms of As uptake and its detoxification in rice are not well understood. Recently, members of the Nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of plant aquaporins were shown to transport arsenite in rice and Arabidopsis. Here we report that members of the rice plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) subfamily are also involved in As tolerance and transport. Based on the homology search with the mammalian AQP9 and yeast Fps1 arsenite transporters, we identified and cloned five rice PIP gene subfamily members. qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment. Heterologous expression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of arsenite. Overexpression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation. Further, these transgenic plants showed no significant accumulation of As in shoot and root tissues in long term uptake assays. Whereas, short duration exposure to arsenite caused both active influx and efflux of As in the roots. The data suggests a bidirectional arsenite permeability of rice PIPs in plants. These rice PIPs genes will be highly useful for engineering important food and biofuel crops for enhanced crop productivity on contaminated soils without increasing the accumulation of toxic As in the biomass or edible tissues.
22312119	QTL analysis for grain quality traits in 2 BC2F2 populations derived from crosses between Oryza sativa cv Swarna and 2 accessions of O. nivara.	None	J Hered	The appearance and cooking quality of rice determine its acceptability and price to a large extent. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 12 grain quality traits were mapped in 2 mapping populations derived from Oryza sativa cv Swarna × O. nivara. The BC(2)F(2) population of the cross Swarna × O. nivara IRGC81848 (population 1) was evaluated during 2005 and that from Swarna × O. nivara IRGC81832 (population 2) was evaluated during 2006. Linkage maps were constructed using 100 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in population 1 and 75 SSR markers in population 2. In all, 21 QTLs were identified in population 1 (43% from O. nivara) and 37 in population 2 (38% QTLs from O. nivara). The location of O. nivara-derived QTLs mp1.2 for milling percent, kw6.1 for kernel width, and klac12.1 for kernel length after cooking coincided in the 2 populations and appear to be useful for Marker Assisted Selection (MAS). Four QTLs for milling percent, 1 QTL each for amylose content, water uptake, elongation ratio, 2 QTLs for kernel width, and 3 QTLs for gel consistency, each explained more than 20% phenotypic variance. Three QTL clusters for grain quality traits were close to the genes/QTLs for shattering and seed dormancy. QTLs for 4 quality traits were associated with 5 of the 7 major yield QTLs reported in the same 2 mapping populations. Useful introgression lines have been developed for several agronomic traits. It emerges that 40% O. nivara alleles were trait enhancing in both populations, and QTLs for grain quality overlapped with yield meta-QTLs and QTLs for dormancy and seed shattering.
22382063	[Discovery of QTLs increasing yield related traits in common wild rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) is an important genetic resource. Discovery of desirable alleles in wild rice will make important contributions to rice genetic improvement. In this study, Zhenshan 97 as the recurrent parent and wild rice as the donor parent were used to develop a BC2F1 population. One plant BC2F1-15 in the population showed distinct phenotype from Zhenshan 97 was selected to produce a population of BC2F5 by continuous self-crossing. The genotype assay of the plant BC2F1-15 with 126 polymorphic SSR markers evenly distributed on 12 chromosomes showed that it was heterozygous at 30% of the control marker loci. Four, 3, 4, 2, and 1 QTLs were detected for heading date, plant height, spikelets per panicle, grain weight, and single plant yield in the BC2F5 population, respectively. One QTL region flanked by the marker interval of RM481-RM2 on chromosome 7 had pleiotropic effects on heading date, spikelets per panicle, and grain yield per plant, and the alleles of wild rice increased phenotypic values. At the other 3 QTLs for spikelets per panicle, common wild rice had positive effects. These results clearly showed that common wild rice carried desirable alleles for yield related traits. The favorable alleles from common wild rice are new valuable genes for rice breeding.
22325886	Transgenic expression of dual positional maize lipoxygenase-1 leads to the regulation of defense-related signaling molecules and activation of the antioxidative enzyme system in rice.	2012	Plant Sci	Effects of transgenic expression of dual positional maize lipoxygenase-1 on the defense system were analyzed in rice. The activities of hydroperoxidelyase and antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) were increased and high levels of aldehydes including malondialdehyde were produced. The constitutive level of jasmonic was slightly increased and the constitutive salicylic acid level was decreased. Kinetic analysis of wound response indicated that the levels of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are inversely correlated in nully transgenic rice plants, suggesting that there is an antagonistic interaction between jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Microarray analysis indicated that several defense-related genes encoding antioxidative enzymes and pathogen-related proteins were up-regulated, and the resistance to rice blast fungus was enhanced in transgenic rice. Taken together, our results suggest that maize lipoxygenase-1 expressed in the cytoplasm plays an important role for the regulation of defense system including the antioxidative enzymes in transgenic rice, and that these effects may be mediated by reactive oxygen species generated through the enzyme-initiated catalytic peroxidation mechanism of maize lipoxygenase-1.
22403030	MicroRNA profiles and their control of male gametophyte development in rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) act as negative regulators of gene expression by slicing target transcripts or inhibiting translation. A number of miRNAs play important roles in development. In order to investigate the potential function of miRNAs during male gametogenesis in rice, we obtained both gene and small RNA expression profiles by combining microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies. From the microarray datasets, 2,925 male gametophyte-specific genes were identified, including 107 transcription factors and three significant Argonaute genes (AGO12, AGO13, and AGO17). From the sRNA-Seq datasets, 104 unique miRNAs (miRus) were identified, including 47 known miRus and 57 novel miRus; interestingly, most of the new miRus are pollen-specific and not conserved among species. Furthermore, an interactive network of miRNA-target was constructed based on the two datasets. By employing enrichment analysis, the miRNA-regulated targets were found to be involved in both the up and down pathways, but predominantly in the down pathways, including 37 GO biological processes and 32 KEGG pathways. These findings indicate that miRNAs play a broad regulatory role during male gametophyte development in rice.
22443148	Spread of herbicide-resistant weedy rice (red rice, Oryza sativa L.) after 5 years of Clearfield rice cultivation in Italy.	2012	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	The weedy relative of cultivated rice, red rice, can invade and severely infest rice fields, as reported by rice farmers throughout the world. Because of its close genetic relationship to commercial rice, red rice has proven difficult to control. Clearfield (Cl) varieties, which are resistant to the inhibiting herbicides in the chemical group AHAS (acetohydroxyacid synthase), provide a highly efficient opportunity to control red rice infestations. In order to reduce the risk of herbicide resistance spreading from cultivated rice to red rice, stewardship guidelines are regularly released. In Italy, the cultivation of Cl cultivars started in 2006. In 2010, surveillance of the possible escape of herbicide resistance was carried out; 168 red rice plants were sampled in 16 fields from six locations containing Cl and traditional cultivars. A first subsample of 119 plants was analysed after herbicide treatment and the resistance was found in 62 plants. Of these 119 plants, 78 plants were randomly selected and analysed at the level of the AHAS gene to search for the Cl mutation determining the resistant genotype: the Cl mutation was present in all the resistant plants. Nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers revealed a high correlation between genetic similarity and herbicide resistance. The results clearly show that Cl herbicide-resistant red rice plants are present in the field, having genetic relationships with the Cl variety. Finding plants homozygous for the mutation suggests that the crossing event occurred relatively recently and that these plants are in the F2 or later generations. These observations raise the possibility that Cl red rice is already within the cultivated rice seed supply.
22443363	OsWRKY22, a monocot WRKY gene, plays a role in the resistance response to blast.	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	With the aim of identifying novel regulators of host and nonhost resistance to fungi in rice, we carried out a systematic mutant screen of mutagenized lines. Two mutant wrky22 knockout lines revealed clear-cut enhanced susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent Magnaporthe oryzae strains and altered cellular responses to nonhost Magnaporthe grisea and Blumeria graminis fungi. In addition, the analysis of the pathogen responses of 24 overexpressor OsWRKY22 lines revealed enhanced resistance phenotypes on infection with virulent M. oryzae strain, confirming that OsWRKY22 is involved in rice resistance to blast. Bioinformatic analyses determined that the OsWRKY22 gene belongs to a well-defined cluster of monocot-specific WRKYs. The co-regulatory analysis revealed no significant co-regulation of OsWRKY22 with a representative panel of OsWRKYs, supporting its unique role in a series of transcriptional responses. In contrast, inquiring a subset of biotic stress-related Affymetrix data, a large number of resistance and defence-related genes were found to be putatively co-expressed with OsWRKY22. Taken together, all gathered experimental evidence places the monocot-specific OsWRKY22 gene at the convergence point of signal transduction circuits in response to both host and nonhost fungi encountering rice plants.
22445751	Differential degradation of photosystem I subunits under iron deficiency in rice.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the staple foods of the world. Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major abiotic stress factor that contributes world-wide to losses in crop yield and decline in nutritional quality. As cofactor for many enzymes and proteins, iron is an essential element. It plays a pivotal role in chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, and iron deficiency may result in decreased Chl production and, thus, reduced photosynthetic capacity. Photosystem I (PSI) is a prime target of iron deficiency because of its high iron content (12 Fe per PS). To understand the protein level changes in the light-harvesting complex (LHC) of PSI (LHCI) under iron deficiency, rice seedlings were grown in Hoagland's nutrient medium with and without Fe. Chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency decreased under iron deficiency. Protein gel blots probed with antibodies against the PSI core and Lhca 1-4 proteins revealed that the core subunits PsaA and PsaB remained stable under iron deficiency, whereas PsaC and PsaD decreased by about 50%, and PsaE was completely degraded. Among the LHCI subunits, Lhca1 and Lhca2 decreased by 40 and 50%, respectively, whereas Lhca3 and Lhca4 were completely degraded. We propose that the dissociation of LHCI subunits may be due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species, which is suggested by the increased activity of superoxide dismutase.
22487175	A conformationally restricted uniconazole analogue as a specific inhibitor of rice ent-kaurene oxidase, CYP701A6.	2012	Bioorg Med Chem Lett	The plant growth retardant uniconazole (UNI), which has been used as an effective inhibitor of ent-kaurene oxidase (CYP701A) involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, also strongly inhibits ABA 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A), a key enzyme in abscisic acid catabolism. Azole P450 inhibitors bind to the P450 active site by both coordinating to the heme-iron atom via an sp(2) nitrogen and interacting with surrounding protein residues through a lipophilic region. We hypothesized that poor selectivity of UNI may result from its small molecular size and flexible conformation that allows it to fit into active sites differing in size and shape. To find a selective inhibitor of CYP701A based on this hypothesis, we examined inhibitory activities of three types of UNI analogues, which were conformationally constrained, enlarged in width, and enlarged in length, against recombinant rice CYP701A6 and Arabidopsis CYP707A3. Conformationally restricted analogues, UFAP2 and UFAP2N, inhibited CYP701A6 as strongly as UNI, whereas it inhibited CYP707A3 less than UNI.
22499179	Rice transgenic plants with suppressed expression of the β subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The deficient mutant for the rice heterotrimeric G protein α subunit gene (RGA1), d1, showed dwarfism and set small seed due to a reduced cell number. Mutants for the rice heterotrimeric G protein β subunit gene (RGB1) have not been isolated. To determine the functions of RGB1, transgenic rice plants with suppressed expression of RGB1 were studied using the RNAi method. RGB1 knock-down lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes and reduced fertility, but these abnormality were not observed in d1. Transgenic plants in which the G protein β subunit was greatly decreased were not obtained, suggesting that the complete suppression of RGB1 mRNA may be lethal. In contrast, the d1 mutants, with complete loss of the G protein α subunit, were fertile and half the size of the WT. These studies suggest that RGB1 has different functions than RGA1.
22345644	Rice cultivars with differing salt tolerance contain similar cation channels in their root cells.	2012	J Exp Bot	Salinity poses a major threat for agriculture worldwide. Rice is one of the major crops where most of the high-yielding cultivars are highly sensitive to salinity. Several studies on the genetic variability across rice cultivars suggest that the activity and composition of root plasma membrane transporters could underlie the observed cultivar-specific salinity tolerance in rice. In the current study, it was found that the salt-tolerant cultivar Pokkali maintains a higher K+/Na+ ratio compared with the salt-sensitive IR20 in roots as well as in shoots. Using Na+ reporter dyes, IR20 root protoplasts showed a much faster Na+ accumulation than Pokkali protoplasts. Membrane potential measurements showed that root cells exposed to Na+ in IR20 depolarized considerably further than those of Pokkali. These results suggest that IR20 has a larger plasma membrane Na+ conductance. To assess whether this could be due to different ion channel properties, root protoplasts from both Pokkali and IR20 rice cultivars were patch-clamped. Voltage-dependent K+ inward rectifiers, K+ outward rectifiers, and voltage-independent, non-selective channels with unitary conductances of around 35, 40, and 10 pS, respectively, were identified. Only the non-selective channel showed significant Na+ permeability. Intriguingly, in both cultivars, the activity of the K+ inward rectifier was drastically down-regulated after plant growth in salt but gating, conductance, and activity of all channel types were very similar for the two cultivars.
22385556	Overexpression of Arabidopsis and rice stress genes' inducible transcription factor confers drought and salinity tolerance to rice.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Rice yield is greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought and salinity. In response to the challenge of producing rice plants tolerant to these stresses, we introduced cDNA encoding the transcription factors DREB1A and DREB1B under the control of the stress inducible rd29 promoter. Two different indica rice cultivars were used, BR29, an improved commercially cultivated variety from Bangladesh and IR68899B, an IRRI bred maintainer line for hybrid rice. Agrobacterium mediated transformation of BR29 was done independently with DREB1A isolated from rice and Arabidopsis and DREB1B isolated from rice, whereas biolistic transformation was done with rice- DREB1B in the case of IR68899B. Initial genetic integration was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Salinity tolerance was assayed in very young seedlings. Drought stress tests were found to be more reliable when they were carried out at the pre-flowering booting stage. RNA gel blot analysis as well as quantitative PCR analysis was performed to estimate the transcription level under stressed and unstressed conditions. Agronomic performance studies were done with stressed and unstressed plants to compare the yield losses due to dehydration and salt loading stresses. Noticeably enhanced tolerance to dehydration was observed in the plants transformed with DREB1A isolated from Arabidopsis while DREB1B was found to be more effective for salt tolerance.
22156226	Molecular spectrum of somaclonal variation in regenerated rice revealed by whole-genome sequencing.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Somaclonal variation is a phenomenon that results in the phenotypic variation of plants regenerated from cell culture. One of the causes of somaclonal variation in rice is the transposition of retrotransposons. However, many aspects of the mechanisms that result in somaclonal variation remain undefined. To detect genome-wide changes in regenerated rice, we analyzed the whole-genome sequences of three plants independently regenerated from cultured cells originating from a single seed stock. Many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) were detected in the genomes of the regenerated plants. The transposition of only Tos17 among 43 transposons examined was detected in the regenerated plants. Therefore, the SNPs and indels contribute to the somaclonal variation in regenerated rice in addition to the transposition of Tos17. The observed molecular spectrum was similar to that of the spontaneous mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the base change ratio was estimated to be 1.74 × 10(-6) base substitutions per site per regeneration, which is 248-fold greater than the spontaneous mutation rate of A. thaliana.
22199373	Structural and functional studies of casein kinase I-like protein from rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Casein kinase I (CKI) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is highly conserved from plants to animals. It performs various functions in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, cytokinesis, vesicular trafficking, morphogenesis and circadian rhythm. CKI proteins contain a highly conserved kinase domain responsible for catalytic activity at the N-terminus and a highly diverse regulatory domain responsible for determining substrate specificity at the C-terminus. CKI-like protein has been identified in plants, including in rice, but its function and structure have not been reported. Here, we report the 2.0 Å crystal structure of the kinase domain of CKI-like protein from rice. Although the structure adopts the typical bi-lobal kinase architecture, the length and orientation of the glycine-rich ATP-binding motif are dynamic within the CKI family. A loop between α5 and α6 (the α5-α6 loop), which was previously not detected in the CKI family because of flexibility, was clearly detected in our structure. In addition, we identified a lipase as a substrate of CKI-like protein from rice. Phosphorylation of the lipase dramatically reduced its catalytic activity, suggesting that CKI may play a role in the regulation of lipase activity.
22112460	Oxidative protein folding: selective pressure for prolamin evolution in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	During seed development, endosperm cells of highly productive cereals, including rice, synthesize disulfide-rich proteins in large amounts and deposit them into storage organelles. Disulfide bond formation involves electron transfer and generates H(2)O(2) as a by-product. To ensure proper development and maturation of seeds, the endosperm cells must supply large amounts of oxidizing equivalents to dithiols in nascent proteins in a controlled manner. This review compares multiple oxidative protein folding systems in yeast, cultured human cells, and rice endosperm. We discuss possible roles of ERO1, other sulfhydryl oxidases, and the protein disulfide isomerase family in the formation of disulfide bonds in storage proteins and the development of protein bodies. Rice prolamins, encoded by a multigene family, are divided into Cys-rich and Cys-depleted subgroups. We discuss the potential importance of disulfide bond formation in the evolution of the prolamin family in japonica rice.
21959793	Biochemical and enzymatic study of rice BADH wild-type and mutants: an insight into fragrance in rice.	2011	Protein J	Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2) is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), one of the major aromatic compounds in fragrant rice. The enzyme can oxidize ω-aminoaldehydes to the corresponding ω-amino acids. This study was carried out to investigate the function of wild-type BADHs and four BADH2 mutants: BADH2_Y420, containing a Y420 insertion similar to BADH2.8 in Myanmar fragrance rice, BADH2_C294A, BADH2_E260A and BADH2_N162A, consisting of a single catalytic-residue mutation. Our results showed that the BADH2_Y420 mutant exhibited less catalytic efficiency towards γ-aminobutyraldehyde but greater efficiency towards betaine aldehyde than wild-type. We hypothesized that this point mutation may account for the accumulation of γ-aminobutyraldehyde/Δ(1)-pyrroline prior to conversion to 2AP, generating fragrance in Myanmar rice. In addition, the three catalytic-residue mutants confirmed that residues C294, E260 and N162 were involved in the catalytic activity of BADH2 similar to those of other BADHs.
22194018	Differential responses of antioxidative defense system to prolonged salinity stress in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2013	Protoplasma	The present investigation evaluated the ability of an antioxidative defense system in terms of the tolerance against salinity-induced oxidative stress and also explored a possible relationship between the status of the components of an antioxidative defense system and the salt tolerance in Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes. When the seedlings of a salt-sensitive cultivar was grown in sand cultures containing different NaCl concentrations (7 and 14 dS m(-1)) for 5-20 days, a substantial increase was observed in the rate of superoxide anion (O (2) (·-) ) production, elevated levels of H(2)O(2) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) which indicated an enhancement in lipid peroxidation. A declination in the level of thiol clearly indicated an increase in the protein oxidation as well as a decline in the reduced forms of ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) and the ratios of their reduced to oxidized forms occurred in the salt-sensitive seedlings. Similar treatment caused a very little alteration or no change in the levels of these components in the seedlings of salt-tolerant cultivar. The activity of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), its isoform Cu/Zn-SOD and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) increased in both the cultivars against salinity. In salt-sensitive seedlings, the activity of the various enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and glutathione reductase (GR) increased at moderate salinity treatment of 7 dS m(-1) NaCl while the activities of these enzymes declined with higher salinity level of 14 dS m(-1) NaCl. However, a consistent increase was observed in the activities of these enzymes of salt-tolerant seedlings with an increase in the duration and the level of the salinity treatment. The results suggest that a higher status of antioxidants (AsA and GSH) and a coordinated higher activity of the enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPX, APX, and GR) can serve as the major determinants in the model for depicting salt tolerance in Indica rice seedlings.
22458437	Identification of quantitative trait loci associated with small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén) resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Hereditas	F(2) and BC(1) populations derived from the cross between 02428 / Rathu Heenati were used to investigate small brown planthopper (SBPH) resistance. Using the F(2) population, three QTLs for antixenosis against SBPH were located on chromosomes 2, 5 and 6, and accounted for 30.75% of the phenotypic variance; three QTLs for antibiosis against SBPH were detected on chromosomes 8, 9 and 12. qSBPH5-c explaining 7.21% of phenotypic variance for antibiosis was identified on chromosome 5 using the BC(1) population. A major QTL, qSBPH12-a1, explained about 40% of the phenotypic variance, and a minor QTL, qSBPH4-a, was detected by the SSST method in both the F(2) and BC(1) populations. The QTLs indentified in the present study will be useful for marker assisted selection of SBPH resistance in rice.
22189605	Inheritance of bacterial blight resistance in the rice cultivar Ajaya and high-resolution mapping of a major QTL associated with resistance.	2011	Genet Res (Camb)	The cultivar Ajaya (IET 8585) exhibits durable broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight (BB) disease of rice and is widely used as a resistance donor. The present study was carried out to decipher the genetics of BB resistance in Ajaya and map the gene(s) conferring resistance. Genetic analysis in the F2 indicated a quantitative/additive nature of resistance governed by two loci with equal effects. Linked marker analysis and allelic tests revealed that one of the resistance genes is xa5. Sequence analysis of a 244 bp region of the second exon of the gene-encoding Transcription factor IIAγ (the candidate gene for xa5) confirmed the presence of xa5. Bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) revealed the putative location of the two quantitative trait loci (QTLs)/genes associated with resistance on chromosomes 5 and 8. Composite interval mapping located the first locus on Chr. 5S exactly in the genomic region spanned by xa5 and the second locus (qtl BBR 8.1) on Chr. 8L. Owing to its differential disease reaction with a set of seven hyper-virulent isolates of Xanthomonas oryzae, a map location on Chr. 8L, which was distinct from xa13 and data from allelism tests, the second resistance locus in Ajaya was determined to be novel and was designated as xaAj. A contig map spanning xaAj was constructed in silico and the genomic region was delimited to a 13.5 kb physical interval. In silico analysis of the genomic region spanning xaAj identified four putatively expressed candidate genes, one of which could be involved in imparting BB resistance in Ajaya along with xa5.
22137606	Drought-responsive mechanisms in rice genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance during reproductive stage.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Water status is the main factor affecting rice production. In order to understand rice strategies in response to drought condition in the field, the drought-responsive mechanisms at the physiological and molecular levels were studied in two rice genotypes with contrasting susceptibility to drought stress at reproductive stage. After 20 d of drought treatment, the osmotic potential of leaves reduced 78% and 8% in drought susceptible rice cultivar Zhenshan97B and tolerant rice cultivar IRAT109, respectively. The panicle lengths had no obvious changes in drought stressed Zhenshan97B and IRAT109, suggesting that drought stress impose less effect on assimilate translocation from leaf to vegetative growth of panicles. IRAT109 showed more extensive deeper root growth that could be considered a second line of defense against drought stress. The C(i)/C(a) ratio exhibited enhancement over reduction of g(s) in both cultivars, reflecting the non-stomatal limitation to photosynthesis occurred during drought stress. Orthophosphate dikinase, glycine dehydrogenase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and ATP synthase were down-regulated for Zhenshan97B in response to drought stress, suggesting the reduction of capacity of carbon assimilation in this rice cultivar. In drought-stressed IRAT109, transketolase, Rubisco were down-regulated, however, Rubisco activase and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, which might alleviate the damage on Rubisco by drought stress, were up-regulated. The increased abundances of chloroplastic superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] and dehydroascorbate reductase might provide antioxidant protection for IRAT109 against damage by dehydration.
22101345	A study of phytohormone biosynthetic gene expression using a circadian clock-related mutant in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	We have recently isolated a rice circadian clock-related mutant carrying a null mutation in Os-GIGANTEA(GI) gene, the solo ortholog of Arabidopsis GI. Time-course global transcriptome analyses of leaves from wild-type and osgi mutant grown in the field have revealed that Os-GI affects gene expression of more than half of genes on rice 44k microarray. To better understand the biological significance of circadian clock function in growth and development of rice, we here investigated the gene expression involved in phytohormone biosynthesis. Here we found that mRNA levels of a few major genes encoding GA2-oxidase which can inactivate bioactive gibberellins (GAs) were remarkably increased in osgi-1 plants. This suggests that Os-GI functions to maintain bioactive GA level through the regulation of the GA-deactivating enzyme genes in rice. Consistently, osgi-1 plants showed semi-dwarf phenotype with reduced internode and leaf sheath elongation.
22150231	Genetic evidence for natural product-mediated plant-plant allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	New Phytol	• There is controversy as to whether specific natural products play a role in directly mediating antagonistic plant-plant interactions - that is, allelopathy. If proved to exist, such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). • However, while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations, demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates. This complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds, but such an approach previously has not been applied. • The rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy. Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli). • Thus, our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant.
22161313	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Mol Biotechnol	The plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC)-domain proteins play important roles in plant development and stress responses. In this research, a full-length cDNA named ENAC1 (early NAC-domain protein induced by abiotic stress 1) was isolated from rice. ENAC1 possess one NAC domain in the N-terminus. Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid. However, the induction of ENAC1 by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer. The promoter sequence of ENAC1 harbors several cis-elements including ABA response elements, but the well-known dehydration responsive element/C-repeat element is absent. The ENAC1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cell. Yeast hybrid assays revealed that ENAC1 was a transcription activator and bound to NAC recognition sequence (NACRS). Co-expression analysis suggested that ENAC1 co-expressed with a number of stress-related genes. Taken together, ENAC1 may be an early transcription activator of stress responses and function in the regulation of NACRS-mediated gene expression under abiotic stress.
22187088	Characteristic expression of rice pathogenesis-related proteins in rice leaves during interactions with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins play an important role in the disease resistance response. To better understand the function of rice PR proteins, we examined the expressions of ten PR proteins in rice leaves at different developmental stages with or without the interaction between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that most of the PR proteins were expressed in rice leaves in normal growth conditions, suggesting that they play a role in rice growth. Six out of ten PR proteins (PR1, PR2, PR3, PR4b, PR8, and PR-pha) showed enhanced expression in Xa21-mediated resistance responses at late stages after inoculation with Xoo. The remaining four PR proteins (PR5, PR6, PR15, and PR16) did not show changes in expression in the resistance response. The expressions of PR proteins in the resistance reaction were further compared with those in the susceptible reaction and a mock treatment. Interestingly, several of the PR proteins were expressed at the highest levels in the susceptible reaction and at the lowest levels in the mock treatment. Among the other four PR proteins, PR5 and PR16 showed changes in the abundance only in the susceptible response, while PR6 and PR15 showed no detectable difference in expression. These data provide fundamental knowledge about the expression of PR proteins in the interaction between rice and Xoo.
22359609	A built-in mechanism to mitigate the spread of insect-resistance and herbicide-tolerance transgenes into weedy rice populations.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The major challenge of cultivating genetically modified (GM) rice (Oryza sativa) at the commercial scale is to prevent the spread of transgenes from GM cultivated rice to its coexisting weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea). The strategic development of GM rice with a built-in control mechanism can mitigate transgene spread in weedy rice populations.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An RNAi cassette suppressing the expression of the bentazon detoxifying enzyme CYP81A6 was constructed into the T-DNA which contained two tightly linked transgenes expressing the Bt insecticidal protein Cry1Ab and the glyphosate tolerant 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), respectively. GM rice plants developed from this T-DNA were resistant to lepidopteran pests and tolerant to glyphosate, but sensitive to bentazon. The application of bentazon of 2000 mg/L at the rate of 40 mL/m(2), which is approximately the recommended dose for the field application to control common rice weeds, killed all F(2) plants containing the transgenes generated from the Crop-weed hybrids between a GM rice line (CGH-13) and two weedy rice strains (PI-63 and PI-1401).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Weedy rice plants containing transgenes from GM rice through gene flow can be selectively killed by the spray of bentazon when a non-GM rice variety is cultivated alternately in a few-year interval. The built-in control mechanism in combination of cropping management is likely to mitigate the spread of transgenes into weedy rice populations.
22368182	Insight into the molecular evolution of non-specific lipid transfer proteins via comparative analysis between rice and sorghum.	2012	DNA Res	Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 9 kDa non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) genes from nine plant species. Each of the five classified types in angiosperms exhibited eight conserved cysteine patterns. The most abundant nsLTP genes fell into the type I category, which was particularly enriched in a grass-specific lineage of clade I.1. Six pairs of tandem copies of nsLTP genes on the distal region of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 were well-preserved under concerted evolution, which was not observed in sorghum. The transgenic promoter-reporter assay revealed that both rice and sorghum nsLTP genes of type I displayed a relatively conserved expression feature in the epidermis of growing tissue, supporting its functional roles in cutin synthesis or defence against phytopathogens. For type I, the frequent expression in the stigma and seed are indicative of functional involvement in pistil-pollen interactions and seed development. By way of contrast, several type V genes were observed, mainly in the vascular bundle of the rosette as well as the young shoots, which might be related with vascular tissue differentiation or defence signalling. Compared with sorghum, the highly redundant tissue-specific expression pattern among members of rice nsLTP genes in clade I.1 suggests that concerted evolution via gene conversion favours the preservation of crucial expression motifs via the homogenization of proximal promoter sequences under high selection constraints. However, extensive regulatory subfunctionalization might also have occurred under relative low selection constraints, resulting in functional divergence at the expression level.
22268496	Construction of rice mini-chromosomes by telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation.	2012	Plant J	Telomere truncation has been shown to be an efficient technology for the creation of mini-chromosomes that can be used as artificial chromosome platforms for genetic engineering. Artificial chromosome-based genetic engineering is considered to be superior to the existing techniques of randomized gene integration by Agrobacterium or biolistic-mediated genetic transformation. It organizes multiple transgenes as a unique genetic linkage block for subsequent manipulations in breeding. Telomere truncation technology relies on three components: the telomere sequence that mediates chromosomal truncation, a selection marker that allows the selection of transgenic events, and a site-specific recombination system that can be used to accept future genes into the mini-chromosome by gene targeting. These elements are usually pre-assembled before transformation, a process that is both time and labor consuming. We found in this research that the three elements could be mixed to transform plant cells in a biolistic transformation, and produced efficient chromosomal truncations and mini-chromosomes in rice. This system will allow rapid construction of mini-chromosomes with a flexible selection of resistant markers, site-specific recombination systems and other desirable elements. In addition, a rice telotrisomic line was used as the starting material for chromosomal truncations. Mini-chromosomes from the truncations of both the telocentric chromosome and other chromosomes were recovered. The mini-chromosomes remained stable during 2 years of subculture. The construction of mini-chromosomes in rice, an economically important crop, will provide a platform for future artificial chromosome-based genetic engineering of rice for stacking multiple genes.
22266099	Identification of an E-box motif responsible for the expression of jasmonic acid-induced chitinase gene OsChia4a in rice.	2012	J Plant Physiol	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is known to be involved in multiple defence responses against pathogens, which include the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. In order to investigate the induction mechanism of the rice defence responses by JA, we performed transcriptome analyses and focused on a chitinase gene, OsChia4a, which was identified to be one of the highest JA-inductive genes. The recombinant protein of His-tagged OsChia4a exhibited an inhibitory effect against the spore germination and hyphal growth of Magnaporthe oryzae. The promoter analysis of OsChia4a revealed that the region from -515 bp to -265 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation site was required for the responsiveness to JA. A subsequent mutation analysis indicated that an E-box (CANNTG) in this region act as a JA-responsive cis element. These results imply that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is likely to be involved in the regulation of the OsChia4a expression in a JA-dependent manner.
22457828	The rice HGW gene encodes a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain protein that regulates heading date and grain weight.	2012	PLoS One	Heading date and grain weight are two determining agronomic traits of crop yield. To date, molecular factors controlling both heading date and grain weight have not been identified. Here we report the isolation of a hemizygous mutation, heading and grain weight (hgw), which delays heading and reduces grain weight in rice. Analysis of hgw mutant phenotypes indicate that the hemizygous hgw mutation decreases latitudinal cell number in the lemma and palea, both composing the spikelet hull that is known to determine the size and shape of brown grain. Molecular cloning and characterization of the HGW gene showed that it encodes a novel plant-specific ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and functions as a key upstream regulator to promote expressions of heading date- and grain weight-related genes. Moreover, co-expression analysis in rice and Arabidopsis indicated that HGW and its Arabidopsis homolog are co-expressed with genes encoding various components of ubiquitination machinery, implying a fundamental role for the ubiquitination pathway in heading date and grain weight control.
22218926	Molecular basis underlying the S5-dependent reproductive isolation and compatibility of indica/japonica rice hybrids.	2012	Plant Physiol	The S5 locus regulates spikelet fertility of indica/japonica hybrid rice (Oryza sativa). There are three alleles at the S5 locus, including an indica allele (S5i), a japonica allele (S5j), and a wide-compatibility allele (S5n). This study analyzed the molecular basis for S5-dependent reproductive isolation and compatibility of indica/japonica rice hybrids. Three S5 alleles were expressed at extremely low levels, and only in the ovary. S5n was more similar to S5i in both RNA and protein expression profiles. The S5 locus was not essential for embryo sac development, although deleterious interactions between S5i and S5j resulted in reduced rates of spikelet fertility. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to test direct interactions between S5-encoded proteins. The results indicated that the S5i- and S5j-encoded eukaryotic aspartyl proteases formed both homodimers and heterodimers, whereas the S5n-encoded aspartyl protease was incapable of dimerization. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a single amino acid difference between S5i- and S5j-encoded aspartyl proteases (phenylalanine/leucine at residue 273) was primarily responsible for embryo sac abortion. The S5 locus may have promoted the subspeciation of indica and japonica, but it also enables gene flow between them.
22239707	Enhancement of ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of rice straw using ethoxylated span 20.	2012	Prep Biochem Biotechnol	In this work, four nonionic surfactants based on sorbitan monolaurate (Span 20) were synthesized by introducing ethylene oxide gas (n = 20, 40, 60, 80 ethylene oxide units) into Span 20 to give four new surfactants with different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), namely, E(20), E(40), E(60), and E(80). The structures of the prepared nonionic surfactants were elucidated using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The surface-tension measurements were recorded. The effects of the prepared nonionic surfactants on the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of microwave/alkali-pretreated rice straw to produce ethanol were investigated. From the obtained data, it was found that the addition of the nonionic surfactants at 2.5 g/L had a positive effect on SSF. The maximum ethanol yield (76 and 55%) was obtained after 72 hr for rice straw using Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. Also, it was found that the ethanol yield increases with increasing HLB of the prepared nonionic surfactants by increasing ethylene oxide units. The adsorption of nonionic surfactants on lignocelluloses is proposed to be due to hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions between nonionic surfactants and the lignin part in the lignocelulose. It can be concluded that additions of surface-active compounds, such as nonionic surfactants, increase enzymatic conversion of rice straw for bioethanol purposes.
22118621	Modification of OsSUT1 gene expression modulates the salt response of rice Oryza sativa cv. Taipei 309.	2012	Plant Sci	A metabolic depletion syndrome was discovered at early vegetative stages in roots of salt sensitive rice cultivars after prolonged exposure to 100mM NaCl. Metabolite profiling analyses demonstrate that this syndrome is part of the terminal stages of the rice salt response. The phenotype encompasses depletion of at least 30 primary metabolites including sucrose, glucose, fructose, glucose-6-P, fructose-6P, organic- and amino-acids. Based on these observations we reason that sucrose allocation to the root may modify the rice response to high salt. This hypothesis was tested using antisense lines of the salt responsive OsSUT1 gene in the salt sensitive Taipei 309 cultivar. Contrary to our expectations of a plant system impaired in one component of sucrose transport, we find improved gas exchange and photosynthetic performance as well as maintenance of sucrose levels in the root under high salinity. Two independent OsSUT1 lines with an antisense inhibition similar to the naturally occurring salt induced reduction of OsSUT1 gene expression showed these phenomena but not a more extreme antisense inhibition line. We investigated the metabolic depletion syndrome by metabolomic and physiological approaches and discuss our results with regard to the potential role of sucrose transporters and sucrose transport for rice salt acclimation.
22284568	Enhanced salt stress tolerance of rice plants expressing a vacuolar H+ -ATPase subunit c1 (SaVHAc1) gene from the halophyte grass Spartina alterniflora Löisel.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	The physiological role of a vacuolar ATPase subunit c1 (SaVHAc1) from a halophyte grass Spartina alterniflora was studied through its expression in rice. The SaVHAc1-expressing plants showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress than the wild-type plants, mainly through adjustments in early stage and preparatory physiological responses. In addition to the increased accumulation of its own transcript, SaVHAc1 expression led to increased accumulation of messages of other native genes in rice, especially those involved in cation transport and ABA signalling. The SaVHAc1-expressing plants maintained higher relative water content under salt stress through early stage closure of the leaf stoma and reduced stomata density. The increased K(+) /Na(+) ratio and other cations established an ion homoeostasis in SaVHAc1-expressing plants to protect the cytosol from toxic Na(+) and thereby maintained higher chlorophyll retention than the WT plants under salt stress. Besides, the role of SaVHAc1 in cell wall expansion and maintenance of net photosynthesis was implicated by comparatively higher root and leaf growth and yield of rice expressing SaVHAc1 over WT under salt stress. The study indicated that the genes contributing toward natural variation in grass halophytes could be effectively manipulated for improving salt tolerance of field crops within related taxa.
22448240	Infection-associated nuclear degeneration in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae requires non-selective macro-autophagy.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae elaborates a specialized infection structure called an appressorium to breach the rice leaf surface and gain access to plant tissue. Appressorium development is controlled by cell cycle progression, and a single round of nuclear division occurs prior to appressorium formation. Mitosis is always followed by programmed cell death of the spore from which the appressorium develops. Nuclear degeneration in the spore is known to be essential for plant infection, but the precise mechanism by which it occurs is not known.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In yeast, nuclear breakdown requires a specific form of autophagy, known as piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus (PMN), and we therefore investigated whether this process occurs in the rice blast fungus. Here, we report that M. oryzae possesses two conserved components of a putative PMN pathway, MoVac8 and MoTsc13, but that both are dispensable for nuclear breakdown during plant infection. MoVAC8 encodes a vacuolar membrane protein and MoTSC13 a peri-nuclear and peripheral ER protein.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show that MoVAC8 is necessary for caffeine resistance, but dispensable for pathogenicity of M. oryzae, while MoTSC13 is involved in cell wall stress responses and is an important virulence determinant. By functional analysis of ΔMoatg1 and ΔMoatg4 mutants, we demonstrate that infection-associated nuclear degeneration in M. oryzae instead occurs by non-selective macroautophagy, which is necessary for rice blast disease.
22378952	Expression of hypoallergenic Der f 2 derivatives with altered intramolecular disulphide bonds induces the formation of novel ER-derived protein bodies in transgenic rice seeds.	2012	J Exp Bot	House dust mites (HDM) are the most common source of indoor allergens and are associated with allergic diseases worldwide. To benefit allergic patients, safer and non-invasive mucosal routes of oral administration are considered to be the best alternative to conventional allergen-specific immunotherapy. In this study, transgenic rice was developed expressing derivatives of the major HDM allergen Der f 2 with reduced Der f 2-specific IgE reactivity by disrupting intramolecular disulphide bonds in Der f 2. These derivatives were produced specifically as secretory proteins in the endosperm tissue of seeds under the control of the endosperm-specific glutelin GluB-1 promoter. Notably, modified Der f 2 derivatives aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and were deposited in a unique protein body (PB)-like structure tentatively called the Der f 2 body. Der f 2 bodies were characterized by their intracellular localization and physico-chemical properties, and were distinct from ER-derived PBs (PB-Is) and protein storage vacuoles (PB-IIs). Unlike ER-derived organelles such as PB-Is, Der f 2 bodies were rapidly digested in simulated gastric fluid in a manner similar to that of PB-IIs. Oral administration in mice of transgenic rice seeds containing Der f 2 derivatives encapsulated in Der f 2 bodies suppressed Der f 2-specific IgE and IgG production compared with that in mice fed non-transgenic rice seeds, and the effect was dependent on the type of Der f 2 derivative expressed. These results suggest that engineered hypoallergenic Der f 2 derivatives expressed in the rice seed endosperm could serve as a basis for the development of viable strategies for the oral delivery of vaccines against HDM allergy.
22353574	Brassinosteroids antagonize gibberellin- and salicylate-mediated root immunity in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a unique class of plant steroid hormones that orchestrate myriad growth and developmental processes. Although BRs have long been known to protect plants from a suite of biotic and abiotic stresses, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still rudimentary. Aiming to further decipher the molecular logic of BR-modulated immunity, we have examined the dynamics and impact of BRs during infection of rice (Oryza sativa) with the root oomycete Pythium graminicola. Challenging the prevailing view that BRs positively regulate plant innate immunity, we show that P. graminicola exploits BRs as virulence factors and hijacks the rice BR machinery to inflict disease. Moreover, we demonstrate that this immune-suppressive effect of BRs is due, at least in part, to negative cross talk with salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellic acid (GA) pathways. BR-mediated suppression of SA defenses occurred downstream of SA biosynthesis, but upstream of the master defense regulators NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 and OsWRKY45. In contrast, BR alleviated GA-directed immune responses by interfering at multiple levels with GA metabolism, resulting in indirect stabilization of the DELLA protein and central GA repressor SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1). Collectively, these data favor a model whereby P. graminicola coopts the plant BR pathway as a decoy to antagonize effectual SA- and GA-mediated defenses. Our results highlight the importance of BRs in modulating plant immunity and uncover pathogen-mediated manipulation of plant steroid homeostasis as a core virulence strategy.
22321318	Metabolome analysis of photosynthesis and the related primary metabolites in the leaves of transgenic rice plants with increased or decreased Rubisco content.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Because the comprehensive effects on metabolism by genetic manipulation of leaf Rubisco content are unknown, metabolome analysis was carried out on transgenic rice plants with increased or decreased Rubisco content using the capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) technique. In RBCS-sense plants, an increase in Rubisco content did not improve light-saturated photosynthesis. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and sedoheputulose 7-phosphate levels increased, but ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), ATP and ADP levels were not affected. It is considered from these results that RuBP regeneration independent of ATP supply became a bottleneck for photosynthesis. In RBCS-antisense plants, a decline in Rubisco content decreased photosynthesis with a substantial accumulation of RuBP. ATP and ADP levels also increased and were associated with increases in the diphosphate and triphosphate compounds of other nucleosides. These results imply that a decline in Rubisco content slowed down the Calvin cycle and that the resultant excess energy of ATP was transferred to other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. The levels of amino acids tended to decline in RBCS-sense plants and increase in RBCS-antisense plants, probably reflecting the demand for Rubisco synthesis. Starch and carbohydrate levels decreased only in RBCS-antisense plants. Thus, genetic manipulation of Rubisco contents widely affected C and N metabolism in rice.
22317787	Exogenous proline and trehalose promote recovery of rice seedlings from salt-stress and differentially modulate antioxidant enzymes and expression of related genes.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Proline (Pro) and Trehalose (Tre) function as compatible solutes and are upregulated in plants under abiotic stress. They play an osmoprotective role in physiological responses, enabling the plants to better tolerate the adverse effects of abiotic stress. We investigated the effect of exogenous Pro and Tre (10 mM) in seedlings of Thai aromatic rice (cv. KDML105; salt-sensitive) during salt stress and subsequent recovery. Salt stress (S, NaCl) resulted in growth reduction, increase in the Na(+)/K(+) ratio, increase in Pro level and up-regulation of Pro synthesis genes (pyrroline-5-carboxylatesynthetase, P5CS; pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, P5CR) as well as accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), increased activity of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; peroxidase, POX; ascorbate peroxidase, APX; catalase, CAT) and transcript up-regulation of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, CytAPX, CatC). Under salt stress, exogenous Pro (PS; Pro+NaCl) reduced the Na(+)/K(+) ratio, further increased endogenous Pro and transcript levels of P5CS and P5CR, but decreased the activity of the four antioxidant enzymes. The transcription of genes encoding several antioxidant enzymes was upregulated. Exogenous Tre (TS; Tre+NaCl) also reduced the Na(+)/K(+) ratio and strongly decreased endogenous Pro. Transcription of P5CS and P5CR was upregulated, the activities of SOD and POX decreased, the activity of APX increased and the transcription of all antioxidant enzyme genes upregulated. Although exogenous osmoprotectants did not alleviate growth inhibition during salt stress, they exhibited a pronounced beneficial effect during recovery period showing higher percentage of growth recovery in PS (162.38%) and TS (98.43%) compared with S (3.68%). During recovery, plants treated with PS showed a much greater reduction in endogenous Pro than NaCl-treated (S) or Tre-treated plants (TS). Increase in CAT activity was most related to significant reduction in H(2)O(2), particularly in the case of PS-treated plants. Advantageous effects of Pro were also associated with increase in APX activity during recovery.
22382682	Rice ASR1 protein with reactive oxygen species scavenging and chaperone-like activities enhances acquired tolerance to abiotic stresses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2012	Mol Cells	Abscisic acid stress ripening (ASR1) protein is a small hydrophilic, low molecular weight, and stress-specific plant protein. The gene coding region of ASR1 protein, which is induced under high salinity in rice (Oryza sativa Ilmi), was cloned into a yeast expression vector pVTU260 and transformed into yeast cells. Heterologous expression of ASR1 protein in transgenic yeast cells improved tolerance to abiotic stresses including hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), high salinity (NaCl), heat shock, menadione, copper sulfate, sulfuric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and also high concentration of ethanol. In particular, the expression of metabolic enzymes (Fba1p, Pgk1p, Eno2p, Tpi1p, and Adh1p), antioxidant enzyme (Ahp1p), molecular chaperone (Ssb1p), and pyrimidine biosynthesis-related enzyme (Ura1p) was up-regulated in the transgenic yeast cells under oxidative stress when compared with wild-type cells. All of these enzymes contribute to an alleviated redox state to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In the in vitro assay, the purified ASR1 protein was able to scavenge ROS by converting H(2)O(2) to H(2)O. Taken together, these results suggest that the ASR1 protein could function as an effective ROS scavenger and its expression could enhance acquired tolerance of ROS-induced oxidative stress through induction of various cell rescue proteins in yeast cells.
22326950	The modulatory influence of p-methoxycinnamic acid, an active rice bran phenolic acid, against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced lipid peroxidation, antioxidant status and aberrant crypt foci in rat colon carcinogenesis.	2012	Chem Biol Interact	We investigated the chemopreventive effect of p-methoxycinnamic acid (p-MCA), an active phenolic acid of rice bran, turmeric, and Kaemperfia galanga against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colon carcinogenesis. Male albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1 consisted of control rats that received a modified pellet diet and 0.1% carboxymethyl cellulose. The rats in Group 2 received a modified pellet diet supplemented with p-MCA [80 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) post-orally (p.o.)] everyday. The rats in Groups 3-6 received 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) (20 mg/kg b.wt.) via subcutaneous injections once a week for the first 4 weeks; additionally, the rats in Groups 4, 5 and 6 received p-MCA at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg b.wt./day p.o., respectively, everyday for 16 weeks. The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experimental period of 16 weeks. The DMH-treated rats exhibited an increased incidence of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) development; an increased crypt multiplicity; decreased concentrations of tissue lipid peroxidation markers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes (CD) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH); decreased levels of tissue enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR); and decreased levels of non-enzymic antioxidants such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamins C, E and A in the colon. Supplementation with p-MCA significantly reversed these changes and significantly inhibited the formation of ACF and its multiplicity. Thus, our findings demonstrate that p-MCA exerts a strong chemopreventive activity against 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis by virtue of its ability to prevent the alterations in DMH-induced circulatory and tissue oxidative stress and preneoplastic changes. p-MCA was more effective when administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg b.wt. than at the other two doses tested.
22348505	Formation mechanism of the internal structure of type I protein bodies in rice endosperm: relationship between the localization of prolamin species and the expression of individual genes.	2012	Plant J	Rice prolamins, a group of seed storage proteins, are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and form type I protein bodies (PB-Is) in endosperm cells. Rice prolamins are encoded by a multigene family. In this study, the spatial accumulation patterns of various prolamin species in rice endosperm cells were investigated to determine the mechanism of formation of the internal structure of PB-Is. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of mature endosperm cells showed that the 10 kDa prolamin is mainly localized in the core of the PB-Is, the 13b prolamin is localized in the inner layer surrounding the core and the outermost layer, and the 13a and 16 kDa prolamins are localized in the middle layer. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of the mRNA for 10 kDa prolamin precedes expression of 13a, 13b-1 and 16 kDa prolamin in the developing stages. mRNA expression for 13b-2 prolamin occurred after that of the other prolamin species. Immunoelectron microscopy of developing seeds showed that the 10 kDa prolamin polypeptide initially accumulates in the ER, and then 13b, 13a, 16 kDa and 13b prolamins are stacked in layers within the ER. Studies with transgenic rice seeds expressing prolamin-GFP fusion proteins under the control of native and constitutive promoters indicated that the temporal expression pattern of prolamin genes influenced the localization of prolamin proteins within the PB-Is. These findings indicate that the control of gene expression of prolamin species contributes to the internal structure of PB-Is.
22361948	Fine mapping of QTLs for rice grain yield under drought reveals sub-QTLs conferring a response to variable drought severities.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Fine-mapping studies on four QTLs, qDTY(2.1), qDTY(2.2), qDTY(9.1) and qDTY(12.1), for grain yield (GY) under drought were conducted using four different backcross-derived populations screened in 16 experiments from 2006 to 2010. Composite and bayesian interval mapping analyses resolved the originally identified qDTY(2.1) region of 42.3 cM into a segment of 1.6 cM, the qDTY(2.2) region of 31.0 cM into a segment of 6.7 cM, the qDTY(9.1) region of 32.1 cM into two segments of 9.4 and 2.4 cM and the qDTY(12.1) region of 10.6 cM into two segments of 3.1 and 0.4 cM. Two of the four QTLs (qDTY(9.1) and qDTY(12.1)) having effects under varying degrees of stress severity showed the presence of more than one region within the original QTL. The study found the presence of a donor allele at RM262 within qDTY(2.1) and RM24334 within qDTY(9.1) showing a negative effect on GY under drought, indicating the necessity of precise fine mapping of QTL regions before using them in marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, the presence of sub-QTLs together in close vicinity to each other provides a unique opportunity to breeders to introgress such regions together as a unit into high-yielding drought-susceptible varieties through MAS.
22340849	Duplication and diversification of the LEAFY HULL STERILE1 and Oryza sativa MADS5 SEPALLATA lineages in graminoid Poales.	2012	Evodevo	BACKGROUND: Gene duplication and the subsequent divergence in function of the resulting paralogs via subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization is hypothesized to have played a major role in the evolution of plant form. The LEAFY HULL STERILE1 (LHS1) SEPALLATA (SEP) genes have been linked with the origin and diversification of the grass spikelet, but it is uncertain 1) when the duplication event that produced the LHS1 clade and its paralogous lineage Oryza sativa MADS5 (OSM5) occurred, and 2) how changes in gene structure and/or expression might have contributed to subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization in the two lineages.

METHODS: Phylogenetic relationships among 84 SEP genes were estimated using Bayesian methods. RNA expression patterns were inferred using in situ hybridization. The patterns of protein sequence and RNA expression evolution were reconstructed using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods, respectively.

RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses mapped the LHS1/OSM5 duplication event to the base of the grass family. MP character reconstructions estimated a change from cytosine to thymine in the first codon position of the first amino acid after the Zea mays MADS3 (ZMM3) domain converted a glutamine to a stop codon in the OSM5 ancestor following the LHS1/OSM5 duplication event. RNA expression analyses of OSM5 co-orthologs in Avena sativa, Chasmanthium latifolium, Hordeum vulgare, Pennisetum glaucum, and Sorghum bicolor followed by ML reconstructions of these data and previously published analyses estimated a complex pattern of gain and loss of LHS1 and OSM5 expression in different floral organs and different flowers within the spikelet or inflorescence.

CONCLUSIONS: Previous authors have reported that rice OSM5 and LHS1 proteins have different interaction partners indicating that the truncation of OSM5 following the LHS1/OSM5 duplication event has resulted in both partitioned and potentially novel gene functions. The complex pattern of OSM5 and LHS1 expression evolution is not consistent with a simple subfunctionalization model following the gene duplication event, but there is evidence of recent partitioning of OSM5 and LHS1 expression within different floral organs of A. sativa, C. latifolium, P. glaucum and S. bicolor, and between the upper and lower florets of the two-flowered maize spikelet.
22378946	Identification and evaluation of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying α-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed.	2012	J Exp Bot	α-Linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of ω6:ω3 fatty acid ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA content and to reduce the ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to ALA. Six ω-3 (Δ-15) fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA content in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g⁻¹ to 8.57 mg g⁻¹ and 10.06 mg g⁻¹, respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA content was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than GmFAD3-1 in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet >80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.
22413771	The photoprotective protein PsbS exerts control over CO(2) assimilation rate in fluctuating light in rice.	2012	Plant J	A direct impact of chloroplastic protective energy dissipation (qE) on photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation has not been shown directly in plants in the absence of photoinhibition. To test this empirically we transformed rice to possess higher (overexpressors, OE) and lower (RNA interference, RNAi) levels of expression of the regulatory psbS gene and analysed CO(2) assimilation in transformants in a fluctuating measurement light regime. Western blots showed a several-fold difference in levels of PsbS protein between RNAi and OE plants with the wild type (WT) being intermediate. At a growth light intensity of 600 μmol m(-2) sec(-1) , the carboxylation capacity, electron transport capacity and dark adapted F(v)/F(m) (ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence) were inhibited in RNAi plants compared with WT and OE. The PsbS content had a significant impact on qE (measured here as non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) but the strongest effect was observed transiently, immediately following the application of light. This capacity for qE was several-fold lower in RNAi plants and significantly higher in OE plants during the first 10 min of illumination. At steady state the differences were reduced: notably at 500 μmol m(-2) sec(-1) all plants had the same NPQ values regardless of PsbS content. During a series of light-dark transitions the induction of CO(2) assimilation was inhibited in OE plants, reducing integrated photosynthesis during the light period. We conclude that the accumulation of PsbS and the resultant qE exerts control over photosynthesis in fluctuating light, showing that optimization of photoprotective processes is necessary for maximum photosynthetic productivity even in the absence of photoinhibitory stress.
22438302	Effect of elevated CO2 and high temperature on seed-set and grain quality of rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	Hybrid vigour may help overcome the negative effects of climate change in rice. A popular rice hybrid (IR75217H), a heat-tolerant check (N22), and a mega-variety (IR64) were tested for tolerance of seed-set and grain quality to high-temperature stress at anthesis at ambient and elevated [CO(2)]. Under an ambient air temperature of 29 °C (tissue temperature 28.3 °C), elevated [CO(2)] increased vegetative and reproductive growth, including seed yield in all three genotypes. Seed-set was reduced by high temperature in all three genotypes, with the hybrid and IR64 equally affected and twice as sensitive as the tolerant cultivar N22. No interaction occurred between temperature and [CO(2)] for seed-set. The hybrid had significantly more anthesed spikelets at all temperatures than IR64 and at 29 °C this resulted in a large yield advantage. At 35 °C (tissue temperature 32.9 °C) the hybrid had a higher seed yield than IR64 due to the higher spikelet number, but at 38 °C (tissue temperature 34-35 °C) there was no yield advantage. Grain gel consistency in the hybrid and IR64 was reduced by high temperatures only at elevated [CO(2)], while the percentage of broken grains increased from 10% at 29 °C to 35% at 38 °C in the hybrid. It is concluded that seed-set of hybrids is susceptible to short episodes of high temperature during anthesis, but that at intermediate tissue temperatures of 32.9 °C higher spikelet number (yield potential) of the hybrid can compensate to some extent. If the heat tolerance from N22 or other tolerant donors could be transferred into hybrids, yield could be maintained under the higher temperatures predicted with climate change.
22443269	Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development.	2012	Plant J	Higher plants have evolved multiple RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), which work with Dicer-like (DCL) proteins to produce different classes of small RNAs with specialized molecular functions. Here we report that OsRDR6, the rice (Oryza sativa L.) homolog of Arabidopsis RDR6, acts in the biogenesis of various types and sizes of small RNAs. We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects. This mutant displays reduced accumulation of tasiR-ARFs, the conserved trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) derived from the TAS3 locus, and ectopic expression of tasiR-ARF target genes, the Auxin Response Factors (including ARF2 and ARF3/ETTIN). The loss of tasiR-mediated repression of ARFs in osrdr6-1 can explain its morphological defects, as expression of two non-targeted ARF3 gene constructs (ARF3muts) in a wild-type background mimics the osrdr6 and osdcl4-1 mutant phenotypes. Small RNA high-throughput sequencing also reveals that besides tasiRNAs, 21-nucleotide (nt) phased small RNAs are also largely dependent on OsRDR6. Unexpectedly, we found that osrdr6-1 has a strong impact on the accumulation of 24-nt phased small RNAs, but not on unphased ones. Our work uncovers the key roles of OsRDR6 in small RNA biogenesis and directly illustrates the crucial functions of tasiR-ARFs in rice development.
22492233	Changes in the contents of metabolites and enzyme activities in rice plants responding to Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn infection: activation of glycolysis and connection to phenylpropanoid pathway.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn causes sheath blight disease in rice, and genetic resistance against it is the most desirable characteristic. Current improvement efforts are based on analysis of polygenic quantitative trait loci (QTLs), but interpretation is limited by the lack of information on the changes in metabolic pathways. Our previous studies linked activation of the glycolytic pathway to enhanced generation of lignin in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The current studies investigated the regulation of glycolysis by examining the time course of changes in enzymatic activities and metabolite contents. The results showed that the activities of all glycolytic enzymes as well as fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P(2)), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate contents increased. These results combined with our previous findings that the expression of phosphoglucomutase (PGM), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase and pyruvate kinase (PK) increased after infection suggested that the additional establishment of glycolysis in the cytosol compartment occurred after infection. Further evidence for this was our recent findings that the increase in expression of the 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) plastid isozyme Os06g05860 was accompanied by an increase in expression of three cytosolic PFK isozymes, i.e. Os01g09570, Os01g53680 and Os04g39420, as well as pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofrucokinase (PFP) isozymes Os08g25720 (α-subunit) and Os06g13810 (β-subunit) in infected rice plants of the resistant line. The results also showed that the reactions catalysed by PFK/PFP, aldolase, GAPDH + phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and PK in leaf sheaths of R. solani-infected rice plants were non-equilibrium reactions in vivo. This study showed that PGM, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), TPI and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGmu) + enolase could be regulated through coarse control whereas, PFK/PFP, aldolase, GAPDH + PGK and PK could be regulated through coarse and fine controls simultaneously.
22434153	Salt and genotype impact on antioxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation in two rice cultivars during de-etiolation.	2013	Protoplasma	Crop yield is severely affected by soil salinity, as salt levels that are harmful to plant growth occur in large terrestrial areas of the world. The present investigation describes the studies of enzymatic activities, in-gel assays, gene expression of some of the major antioxidative enzymes, tocopherol accumulation, lipid peroxidation, ascorbate and dehydroascorbate contents in a salt-sensitive rice genotype PB1, and a relatively salt-tolerant cultivar CSR10 in response to 200 mM NaCl. Salt solution was added to the roots of hydroponically grown 5-day-old etiolated rice seedlings, 12 h prior to transfer to cool white fluorescent + incandescent light (100 μmol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Total tocopherol and ascorbate contents declined in salt-stressed rice seedlings. Among antioxidative enzymes, an increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.11), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), and their gene expression was observed in both cultivars in response to salt stress. The salt-tolerant cultivar CSR10 resisted stress due to its early preparedness to combat oxidative stress via upregulation of gene expression and enzymatic activities of antioxidative enzymes and a higher redox status of the antioxidant ascorbate even in a non-stressed environment.
22414443	Functional interaction between plastidial starch phosphorylase and starch branching enzymes from rice during the synthesis of branched maltodextrins.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The present study established the way in which plastidial α-glucan phosphorylase (Pho1) synthesizes maltodextrin (MD) which can be the primer for starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm. The synthesis of MD by Pho1 was markedly accelerated by branching enzyme (BE) isozymes, although the greatest effect was exhibited by the presence of branching isozyme I (BEI) rather than by isozyme IIa (BEIIa) or isozyme IIb (BEIIb). The enhancement of the activity of Pho1 by BE was not merely due to the supply of a non-reducing ends. At the same time, Pho1 greatly enhanced the BE activity, possibly by generating a branched carbohydrate substrate which is used by BE with a higher affinity. The addition of isoamylase to the reaction mixture did not prevent the concerted action of Pho1 and BEI. Furthermore, in the product, the branched structure was, at least to some extent, maintained. Based on these results we propose that the interaction between Pho1 and BE is not merely due to chain-elongating and chain-branching reactions, but occurs in a physically and catalytically synergistic manner by each activating the mutual capacity of the other, presumably forming a physical association of Pho1, BEI and branched MDs. This close interaction might play a crucial role in the synthesis of branched MDs and the branched MDs can act as a primer for the biosynthesis of amylopectin molecules.
22447493	A novel mechanism of gall midge resistance in the rice variety Kavya revealed by microarray analysis.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	The Asian rice gall midge [Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason)] is an important rice pest causing an annual average yield loss of about US $80 million in India. Rice varieties possess several discrete resistance (R) genes conferring resistance against the pest in two distinct ways, i.e., with (HR+ type) or without (HR- type) the expression of hypersensitive reaction (HR). The aim of the present work is to understand the molecular basis of compatible and incompatible (HR- type) rice gall midge interactions between the rice variety Kavya and the two gall midge biotypes: the virulent GMB4M and the avirulent GMB1 using transcriptional microarray gene expression analysis. A large number of differentially expressed genes (602genes in incompatible interaction and 1,330 genes in compatible interaction with at least twofold changes, p value <0.05) was obtained from the microarray analysis that could be grouped into six clusters based on their induction during both or either of the interactions. MapMan software was used for functional characterization of these genes into 13 categories (BINs). Real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of 26 genes selected through the analysis revealed four genes viz. NADPH oxidase, AtrbohF, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, and von Willebrand factor type A domain containing protein coding genes to be significantly upregulated during the incompatible interaction. But most of the signature genes related to HR+ type resistance like salicylic acid pathway-related genes and disease resistance protein coding genes were downregulated. On the other hand, during the compatible interaction, genes related to primary metabolism and nutrient transport were upregulated and genes for defense and signaling were downregulated. We propose a hypothesis that HR- type of resistance in the rice variety Kavya against gall midge could be due to the constitutive expression of an R gene and a case of extreme resistance which is devoid of cell death. Compatible interaction, however, modulated a large number of differentially expressed transcripts to reprogram cell organization, cell remodeling, and relocation of nutrients through transport to support insect growth.
22409537	Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters.	2012	Plant J	Tiller initiation and panicle development are important agronomical traits for grain production in Oryza sativa L. (rice), but their regulatory mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, T-DNA mutant and RNAi transgenic approaches were used to functionally characterize a unique rice gene, LAGGING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 1 (LGD1). The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield. The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism. Several independent LGD1-RNAi lines exhibited defective phenotypes similar to those observed in lgd1. Interestingly, LGD1 encodes multiple transcripts with different transcription start sites (TSSs), which were validated by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' and 3' cDNA ends (RLM-RACE). Additionally, GUS assays and a luciferase promoter assay confirmed the promoter activities of LGD1.1 and LGD1.5. LGD1 encoding a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain containing protein is a single gene in rice that is seemingly specific to grasses. GFP-tagged LGD1 isoforms were predominantly detected in the nucleus, and weakly in the cytoplasm. In vitro northwestern analysis showed the RNA-binding activity of the recombinant C-terminal LGD1 protein. Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity. Hence, the study of LGD1 will strengthen our understanding of the molecular basis of the multiple transcripts, and their corresponding polypeptides with RNA binding activity, that regulate pleiotropic effects in rice.
22408076	The MADS29 transcription factor regulates the degradation of the nucellus and the nucellar projection during rice seed development.	2012	Plant Cell	The MADS box transcription factors are critical regulators of rice (Oryza sativa) reproductive development. Here, we here report the functional characterization of a rice MADS box family member, MADS29, which is preferentially expressed in the nucellus and the nucellar projection. Suppressed expression of MADS29 resulted in abnormal seed development; the seeds were shrunken, displayed a low grain-filling rate and suppressed starch biosynthesis, and contained abnormal starch granules. Detailed analysis indicated that the abnormal seed development is due to defective programmed cell death (PCD) of the nucellus and nucellar projection, which was confirmed by a TUNEL assay and transcriptome analysis. Further studies showed that expression of MADS29 is induced by auxin and MADS29 protein binds directly to the putative promoter regions of genes that encode a Cys protease and nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat proteins, thereby stimulating the PCD. This study identifies MADS29 as a key regulator of early rice seed development by regulating the PCD of maternal tissues. It provides informative clues to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of maternal tissue degradation after fertilization and to facilitate the studies of endosperm development and seed filling.
22393242	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis.	2012	J Cell Sci	In budding yeast, the ZMM complex is closely associated with class I crossovers and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. However, the relationship between the ZMM genes remains unclear in most higher eukaryotes. Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1. Our results show that in the rice zip4 mutant, the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced, although synapsis proceeds with only mild defects. Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes. Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa. Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice. Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants. These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1.
22183295	Analysis of copy-number variation, insertional polymorphism, and methylation status of the tiniest class I (TRIM) and class II (MITE) transposable element families in various rice strains.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Transposable elements (TEs) dominate the genetic capacity of most eukaryotes, especially plants, where they may compose up to 90% of the genome. Many studies, both in plants and animals reported that in fact non-autonomous elements that have lost their protein-coding sequences and became miniature elements were highly associated with genes, and showed a high level of transpositional activity such as mPing family in rice. In this study, we have investigated in detail the copy number, insertional polymorphism and the methylation status of the tiniest LTR retrotransposon family, termed TRIM, in nine rice strains, in comparison with mPing. While TRIM showed similar copy numbers (average of 79 insertions) in all the nine rice strains, the copy number of mPing varied dramatically (ranging from 6 to 203 insertions) in the same strains. Site-specific PCR analysis revealed that ~58% of the TRIM elements have identical insertion sites among the nine rice strains, while none of the mPing elements (100% polymorphism) have identical insertion sites in the same strains. Finally, over 65% of the TRIM insertion sites were cytosine methylated in all nine rice strains, while the level of the methylated mPing insertion sites ranged between 43 and 81.5%. The findings of this study indicate that unlike mPing, TRIM is most probably a fossil TE family in rice. In addition, the data shows that there might be a strong correlation between TE methylation and copy number.
22139140	Two non-allelic nuclear genes restore fertility in a gametophytic pattern and enhance abiotic stress tolerance in the hybrid rice plant.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	In indica rice, the HongLian (HL)-type combination of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and fertility restoration (Rf) is widely used for the production of commercial hybrid seeds in China, Laos, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. Generally, any member of the gametophytic fertility restoration system, 50% of the pollen in hybrid F(1) plants displays recovered sterility. In this study, however, a HL-type hybrid variety named HongLian You6 had approximately 75% normal (viable) pollen rather than the expected 50%. To resolve this discrepancy, several fertility segregation populations, including F(2) and BC(1)F(1) derived from the HL-CMS line Yuetai A crossed with the restorer line 9311, were constructed and subjected to genetic analysis. A gametophytic restoration model was discovered to involve two non-allelic nuclear restorer genes, Rf5 and Rf6. The Rf5 had been previously identified using a positional clone strategy. The Rf6 gene represents a new restorer gene locus, which was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 8. The hybrid F(1) plants containing one restorer gene, either Rf5 or Rf6, displayed 50% normal pollen grains with I(2)-KI solution; however, those with both Rf5 and Rf6 displayed 75% normal pollens. We also established that the hybrid F(1) plants including both non-allelic restorer genes exhibited an increased stable seed setting when subjected to stress versus the F(1) plants with only one restorer gene. Finally, we discuss the breeding scheme for the plant gametophytic CMS/Rf system.
22179305	Fine mapping of a major QTL for flag leaf width in rice, qFLW4, which might be caused by alternative splicing of NAL1.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	Leaf width is an important agricultural trait in rice. QTL mapping in a recombinant inbred line population derived from the cross between the javanica cultivar D50 (narrow-leaved) and the indica cultivar HB277 (wide-leaved) identified five QTLs controlling flag leaf width. Fine mapping of the major QTL qFLW4 narrowed its location to a 74.8 kb interval between the SSR loci RM17483 and RM17486, a region which also contains the gene NAL1 (Narrow leaf 1). There was no difference in the level of NAL1 expression between cvs. D50 and HB277, but an analysis of the NAL1 transcripts showed that while most (if not all) of those produced in cv. D50 were full-length, two-thirds of those in HB277 were non-functional due to either loss or gain of sequence. The inference was that NAL1 is probably synonymous with qFLW4, and that the functional difference between the two alleles was due to alternative splicing. The analysis of expression of other known genes involved in the determination of leaf width provided no evidence of their having any clear functional association with qFLW4/NAL1.
22194889	IGF-1 induction by acylated steryl β-glucosides found in a pre-germinated brown rice diet reduces oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The pathology of diabetic neuropathy involves oxidative stress on pancreatic β-cells, and is related to decreased levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Acylated steryl β-glucoside (PR-ASG) found in pre-germiated brown rice is a bioactive substance exhibiting properties that enhance activity of homocysteine-thiolactonase (HTase), reducing oxidative stress in diabetic neuropathy. The biological importance of PR-ASG in pancreatic β-cells remains unknown. Here we examined the effects of PR-ASG on IGF-1 and glucose metabolism in β-cells exposed to oxidative stress.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, a pre-germinated brown rice (PR)-diet was tested in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Compared with diabetic rats fed control diets, the PR-diet fed rats showed an improvement of serum metabolic and neurophysiological parameters. In addition, IGF-1 levels were found to be increased in the serum, liver, and pancreas of diabetic rats fed the PR-diet. The increased IGF-1 level in the pancreas led us to hypothesize that PR-ASG is protective for islet β-cells against the extensive injury of advanced or severe diabetes. Thus we examined PR-ASG to determine whether it showed anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative effects on the insulin-secreting β-cells line, INS-1; and additionally, whether PR-ASG stimulated IGF-1 autocrine secretion/IGF-1-dependent glucose metabolism. We have demonstrated for the first time that PR-ASG increases IGF-1 production and secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that PR-ASG may affect pancreatic β-cells through the activation of an IGF-1-dependent mechanism in the diabetic condition. Thus, intake of pre-germinated brown rice may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of diabetes, in particular diabetic neuropathy.
22207572	Positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is essential for shoot apical meristem maintenance in rice.	2011	Plant Cell	Self-maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs are formed throughout the life cycle, is crucial in plant development. Class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes restrict cell differentiation and play an indispensable role in maintaining the SAM. However, the mechanism that positively regulates their expression is unknown. Here, we show that expression of a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene, Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1), is positively regulated by direct autoregulation. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutants of OSH1 lose the SAM just after germination but can be rescued to grow until reproductive development when they are regenerated from callus. Double mutants of osh1 and d6, a loss-of-function mutant of OSH15, fail to establish the SAM both in embryogenesis and regeneration. Expression analyses in these mutants reveal that KNOX gene expression is positively regulated by the phytohormone cytokinin and by KNOX genes themselves. We demonstrate that OSH1 directly binds to five KNOX loci, including OSH1 and OSH15, through evolutionarily conserved cis-elements and that the positive autoregulation of OSH1 is indispensable for its own expression and SAM maintenance. Thus, the maintenance of the indeterminate state mediated by positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is an indispensable mechanism of self-maintenance of the SAM.
22213809	Characterization of the wheat gene encoding a grain-specific lipid transfer protein TdPR61, and promoter activity in wheat, barley and rice.	2012	J Exp Bot	The TaPR61 gene from bread wheat encodes a lipid transfer protein (LTP) with a hydrophobic signal peptide, predicted to direct the TaPR61 protein to the apoplast. Modelling of TaPR61 revealed the presence of an internal cavity which can accommodate at least two lipid molecules. The full-length gene, including the promoter sequence of a TaPR61 orthologue, was cloned from a BAC library of Triticum durum. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of TaPR61 and TdPR61 mainly in grain. A transcriptional TdPR61 promoter-GUS fusion was stably transformed into wheat, barley, and rice. The strongest GUS expression in all three plants was found in the endosperm transfer cells, the embryo surrounding region (ESR), and in the embryo. The promoter is strong and has similar but not identical spatial patterns of activity in wheat, barley, and rice. These results suggest that the TdPR61 promoter will be a useful tool for improving grain quality by manipulating the quality and quantity of nutrient/lipid uptake to the endosperm and embryo. Mapping of regions important for the promoter function using transient expression assays in developing embryos resulted in the identification of two segments important for promoter activation in embryos. The putative cis-elements from the distal segment were used as bait in a yeast 1-hybrid (Y1H) screen of a cDNA library prepared from the liquid part of the wheat multinucleate syncytium. A transcription factor isolated in the screen is similar to BES1/BLZ1 from Arabidopsis, which is known to be a key transcriptional regulator of the brassinosteroid signalling pathway.
22212906	Analysis of the APX, PGD1 and R1G1B constitutive gene promoters in various organs over three homozygous generations of transgenic rice plants.	2012	Planta	We have previously characterized the constitutively active promoters of the APX, PGD1 and R1G1B genes in rice (Park et al. 2010 in J Exp Bot 61:2459-2467). To have potential crop biotechnology applications, gene promoters must be stably active over many generations. In our current study, we report our further detailed analysis of the APX, PGD1 and R1G1B gene promoters in various organs and tissues of transgenic rice plants for three (T₃₋₅) homozygous generations. The copy numbers in 37 transgenic lines that harbor promoter:gfp constructs were determined and promoter activities were measured by real-time qPCR. Analysis of the 37 lines revealed that 15 contained a single copy of one of the three promoter:gfp chimeric constructs. The promoter activity levels were generally higher in multi-copy lines, whereas variations in these levels over the T₃₋₅ generations studied were observed to be smaller in single-copy than in multi-copy lines. The three promoters were further found to be highly active in the whole plant body at both the vegetative and reproductive stages of plant growth, with the exception of the APX in the ovary and R1G1B in the pistil and filaments where zero or very low levels of activity were detected. Of note, the spatial activities of the PGD1 promoter were found to be strikingly similar to those of the ZmUbi1, a widely used constitutive promoter. Our comparison of promoter activities between T₃, T₄ and T₅ plants revealed that the APX, PGD1 and R1G1B promoters maintained their activities at comparable levels in leaves and roots over three homozygous generations and are therefore potentially viable alternative promoters for crop biotechnology applications.
22351029	Use of a callus-specific selection system to develop transgenic rice seed accumulating a high level of recombinant protein.	2012	Methods Mol Biol	A mutated rice acetolactate synthase (mALS) gene expressed under the control of the rice callus-specific promoter (CSP) (CSP:mALS) becomes a useful selectable marker for producing transgenic rice seed with higher accumulation of recombinant protein. When amounts of transgene products in mature seeds are compared between transgenic rice lines containing the CSP:mALS selection gene cassette and those with the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (35S:HPT), the former transgenic rice seeds usually resulted in 1.2- to 2-fold higher accumulation of transgene products than in the latter. It is considered that specific expression of a selection marker gene at the selection stage may allow enhanced transgene products in seeds.This chapter represents a highly efficient Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation system using the CSP:mALS gene cassette in place of the conventional constitutive selection using bacterial antibiotics. This selection stage specific expression using a rice-derived selection marker mALS will be especially beneficial for developing transgenic rice seeds accumulating bioactive proteins or peptides contributing to human health promotion; pharmaceutical products such as vaccine, antibodies, and biopharmaceuticals; and industrial enzymes.
22291889	Unraveling the complex trait of harvest index with association mapping in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	Harvest index is a measure of success in partitioning assimilated photosynthate. An improvement of harvest index means an increase in the economic portion of the plant. Our objective was to identify genetic markers associated with harvest index traits using 203 O. sativa accessions. The phenotyping for 14 traits was conducted in both temperate (Arkansas) and subtropical (Texas) climates and the genotyping used 154 SSRs and an indel marker. Heading, plant height and weight, and panicle length had negative correlations, while seed set and grain weight/panicle had positive correlations with harvest index across both locations. Subsequent genetic diversity and population structure analyses identified five groups in this collection, which corresponded to their geographic origins. Model comparisons revealed that different dimensions of principal components analysis (PCA) affected harvest index traits for mapping accuracy, and kinship did not help. In total, 36 markers in Arkansas and 28 markers in Texas were identified to be significantly associated with harvest index traits. Seven and two markers were consistently associated with two or more harvest index correlated traits in Arkansas and Texas, respectively. Additionally, four markers were constitutively identified at both locations, while 32 and 24 markers were identified specifically in Arkansas and Texas, respectively. Allelic analysis of four constitutive markers demonstrated that allele 253 bp of RM431 had significantly greater effect on decreasing plant height, and 390 bp of RM24011 had the greatest effect on decreasing panicle length across both locations. Many of these identified markers are located either nearby or flanking the regions where the QTLs for harvest index have been reported. Thus, the results from this association mapping study complement and enrich the information from linkage-based QTL studies and will be the basis for improving harvest index directly and indirectly in rice.
22306876	[Characterisation of a rice dwarf and twist leaf 1 (dtl1) mutant and fine mapping of DTL1 gene].	2012	Yi Chuan	Plant height is one of the most important agronomic traits, which determines grain yield. By a largescale screening of our mutant population, we identified a dwarf with twisty leaf mutant (dwarf and twist leaf 1, dtl1). Besides dwarf with twisty leaf, dtl1 also showed reduced tiller number and sterile phenotypes. Based on the internode length of dtl1, this mutant belongs to the nl type of dwarfing phenotype. Physiological assay with two phytohormones, gibberellin (GA), and brassinosteroid (BR), suggested that dtl1 was neither deficient nor insensitive to GA and BR. Genetic analysis showed that the phenotype of dtl1 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using F2 population derived from a cross between dtl1 and an indica cultivar Taichung Native 1, the DTL1 gene was narrowed down to a 70.4 kb between two SSR markers, RM25923 and RM6673, on the long arm of chromosome 10, and co-segregated with InDel marker Z10-29, where thirteen open reading frames were predicted without known gene involved in controlling plant height. Thus, the DTL1 gene might be a novel gene which is related to plant height in rice.
22271747	Gradual increase of miR156 regulates temporal expression changes of numerous genes during leaf development in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	The highly conserved plant microRNA, miR156, is an essential regulator for plant development. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), miR156 modulates phase changing through its temporal expression in the shoot. In contrast to the gradual decrease over time in the shoot (or whole plant), we found that the miR156 level in rice (Oryza sativa) gradually increased from young leaf to old leaf after the juvenile stage. However, the miR156-targeted rice SQUAMOSA-promoter binding-like (SPL) transcription factors were either dominantly expressed in young leaves or not changed over the time of leaf growth. A comparison of the transcriptomes of early-emerged old leaves and later-emerged young leaves from wild-type and miR156 overexpression (miR156-OE) rice lines found that expression levels of 3,008 genes were affected in miR156-OE leaves. Analysis of temporal expression changes of these genes suggested that miR156 regulates gene expression in a leaf age-dependent manner, and miR156-OE attenuated the temporal changes of 2,660 genes. Interestingly, seven conserved plant microRNAs also showed temporal changes from young to old leaves, and miR156-OE also attenuated the temporal changes of six microRNAs. Consistent with global gene expression changes, miR156-OE plants resulted in dramatic changes including precocious leaf maturation and rapid leaf/tiller initiation. Our results indicate that another gradient of miR156 is present over time, a gradual increase during leaf growth, in addition to the gradual decrease during shoot growth. Gradually increased miR156 expression in the leaf might be essential for regulating the temporal expression of genes involved in leaf development.
22257489	Drought-induced root aerenchyma formation restricts water uptake in rice seedlings supplied with nitrate.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Previous studies demonstrated that ammonium nutrition results in higher water uptake rate than does nitrate nutrition under water stress, and thus enhances the tolerance of rice plants to water stress. However, the process by which water uptake is related to nitrogen form under water stress remains unknown. A hydroponic experiment with simulated water stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG6000) was conducted in a greenhouse to study the relationship between root aerenchyma formation and water uptake rate, such as xylem sap flow rate and hydraulic conductance, in two different rice cultivars (cv. 'Shanyou 63' hybrid indica and cv. 'Yangdao 6' indica, China). The results showed that root aerenchyma tissue increased in water-stressed plants of both cultivars fed by nitrate. No significant difference was found in root hydraulic conductivity and/or xylem sap flow rate between the two rice cultivars fed by ammonium regardless of water status, whereas these parameters decreased significantly in water-stressed plants fed by nitrate. It was concluded that aerenchyma that formed in the root cortex impeded the radial transport of water in the root cylinder and decreased water uptake in water-stressed rice plants fed by nitrate. Water transport occurred mainly through Hg-sensitive water channels in rice roots supplied with ammonium.
22306354	Excess copper induced oxidative stress and response of antioxidants in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	To investigate the effects of copper (Cu), rice plant (Oryza sativa. L. var. MSE-9) was treated with different Cu concentrations (0, 10, 50 and 100 μM) for 5 days in hydroponic condition. Gradual decrease in shoot and root growth was observed with the increase of Cu concentration and duration of treatment where maximum inhibition was recorded in root growth. Cu was readily absorbed by the plant though the maximum accumulation was found in root than shoot. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production and lipid peroxidation were found increased with the elevated Cu concentration indicating excess Cu induced oxidative stress. Antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were effectively generated at the elevated concentrations of Cu though catalase (CAT) did not show significant variation with respect to control. Ascorbate (ASH), glutathione (GSH) and proline contents were also increased in all the Cu treated plants compared with the control. SOD isoenzyme was greatly affected by higher concentration of Cu and it was consistent with the changes of the activity assayed in solution. The present study confirmed that excess Cu inhibits growth, induced oxidative stress by inducing ROS formation while the stimulated antioxidative system appears adaptive response of rice plant against Cu induced oxidative stress. Moreover proline accumulation in Cu stress plant seems to provide additional defense against the oxidative stress.
22324885	Rubisco activity is associated with photosynthetic thermotolerance in a wild rice (Oryza meridionalis).	2012	Physiol Plant	Oryza meridionalis is a wild species of rice, endemic to tropical Australia. It shares a significant genome homology with the common domesticated rice Oryza sativa. Exploiting the fact that the two species are highly related but O. meridionalis has superior heat tolerance, experiments were undertaken to identify the impact of temperature on key events in photosynthesis. At an ambient CO(2) partial pressure of 38 Pa and irradiance of 1500 µmol quanta m(-2) s(-1), the temperature optimum of photosynthesis was 33.7 ± 0.8°C for O. meridionalis, significantly higher than the 30.6 ± 0.7°C temperature optimum of O. sativa. To understand the basis for this difference, we measured gas exchange and rubisco activation state between 20 and 42°C and modeled the response to determine the rate-limiting steps of photosynthesis. The temperature response of light respiration (R(light)) and the CO(2) compensation point in the absence of respiration (Γ(*)) were determined and found to be similar for the two species. C3 photosynthesis modeling showed that despite the difference in susceptibility to high temperature, both species had a similar temperature-dependent limitation to photosynthesis. Both rice species were limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration at temperatures of 25 and 30°C but became RuBP carboxylation limited at 35 and 40°C. The activation state of rubisco in O. meridionalis was more stable at higher temperatures, explaining its greater heat tolerance compared with O. sativa.
22458969	Functionally important amino acids in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1.	2012	Biochemistry	Six conserved, charged amino acids within membrane spans in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 were identified using a three-dimensional structural model based on the crystal structures of three major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins: LacY, GlpT, and EmrD. These positions in OsSUT1 were selected for mutagenesis and biochemical assays. Among the six mutants, D177N completely lost transport function, D331N retained only a small fraction of sucrose uptake activity (2.3% of that of the wild type), and R335H and E336Q also displayed a substantial decrease in transport activity. D329N functioned as well as wild-type OsSUT1. R188K did not transport sucrose but showed a H(+) leak that was inhibited by sucrose, indicating that R188K had uncoupled sucrose and H(+) translocation. This demonstrates that charged amino acids within membrane spans are important for the transport mechanism of OsSUT1 as they are in lactose permease.
22481119	OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Seedling vigor is among the major determinants of stable stand establishment in direct-seeded rice (Oryza sativa L.) in temperate regions. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seedling vigor were identified using 250 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two japonica rice cultivars Kakehashi and Dunghan Shali. Seedling heights measured at 14 days after sowing were 20.3 and 29.4 cm for Kakehashi and Dunghan Shali, respectively. For the RILs, the height ranged from 14.1 to 31.7 cm. Four putative QTLs associated with seedling height were detected. qPHS3-2, the major QTL that was located on the long arm of chromosome 3, accounted for 26.2 % of the phenotypic variance. Using progeny of the near isogenic lines (NILs) produced by the backcross introduction of a chromosome segment carrying this major QTL into an elite cultivar Iwatekko, we fine-mapped qPHS3-2 to a 81-kb interval between two markers, ID_CAPS_01 and RM16227. Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. The relative expression levels of GA20ox1 in seedlings of Dunghan Shali and NILs were higher than that of Iwatekko. Concomitantly, the amount of endogenous active GA was higher in Dunghan Shali and the NILs compared to the level detected in Iwatekko. These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice.
22489666	Salt-induced chloroplast protrusion is the process of exclusion of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from chloroplasts into cytoplasm in leaves of rice.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Chloroplast protrusions (CPs) are often observed under environmental stresses, but their role has not been elucidated. The formation of CPs was observed in the leaf of rice plants treated with 75 mm NaCl for 14 d. Some CPs were almost separated from the main chloroplast body. In some CPs, inner membrane structures and crystalline inclusions were included. Similar structures surrounded by double membranes were observed in the cytoplasm and vacuole. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was detected in CPs and the similar structures in the cytoplasm and vacuole. These results suggest that CP is one of the pathways of Rubisco exclusion from chloroplasts into the cytoplasm under salinity, and the exclusions could be transported to vacuole for their degradation.
22420996	Calcium deficiency increases Cd toxicity and Ca is required for heat-shock induced Cd tolerance in rice seedlings.	2012	J Plant Physiol	While growing in the field, plants may encounter several different forms of abiotic stress simultaneously, rather than a single stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of calcium (Ca) deficiency on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in rice seedlings. Calcium deficiency alone decreased the length, fresh and dry weight, and the Ca concentration in shoots and roots. Also, the content of glutathione (GSH), the ratio of GSH/oxidized glutathione, and the activity of catalase were lower in Ca-deficient leaves compared to control leaves. Exogenous Cd caused a decrease in the contents of chlorophyll and protein, and induced oxidative stress. Based on these stress indicators, we found that Ca deficiency enhanced Cd toxicity in rice seedlings. Under exogenous Cd application, internal Cd concentrations were higher in Ca-deficient shoots and roots than in the respective controls. Moreover, we observed that Ca deficiency decreased heat-shock (HS) induced expression of HS protein genes Oshsp17.3, Oshsp17.7, and Oshsp18.0 in leaves thereby weakening the protection system and increasing Cd stress. In conclusion, Ca deficiency enhances Cd toxicity, and Ca may be required for HS response in rice seedlings.
22434195	Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1.	2012	Nat Commun	Rice MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) and its orthologues LS/LAS (lateral suppressor in tomato and Arabidopsis) are key promoting factors of shoot branching and tillering in higher plants. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating MOC1/LS/LAS have remained elusive. Here we show that the rice tiller enhancer (te) mutant displays a drastically increased tiller number. We demonstrate that TE encodes a rice homologue of Cdh1, and that TE acts as an activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex. We show that TE coexpresses with MOC1 in the axil of leaves, where the APC/C(TE) complex mediates the degradation of MOC1 by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway, and consequently downregulates the expression of the meristem identity gene Oryza sativa homeobox 1, thus repressing axillary meristem initiation and formation. We conclude that besides having a conserved role in regulating cell cycle, APC/C(TE) has a unique function in regulating the plant-specific postembryonic shoot branching and tillering, which are major determinants of plant architecture and grain yield.
22396244	Persistence of pyrazosulfuron in rice-field and laboratory soil under Indian tropical conditions.	2012	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Pyrazosulfuron ethyl, a new rice herbicide belonging to the sulfonylurea group, has recently been registered in India for weed control in rice crops. Many field experiments revealed the bioefficacy of this herbicide; however, no information is available on the persistence of this herbicide in paddy soil under Indian tropical conditions. Therefore, a field experiment was undertaken to investigate the fate of pyrazosulfuron ethyl in soil and water of rice fields. Persistence studies were also carried out under laboratory conditions in sterile and non-sterile soil to evaluate the microbial contribution to degradation.

RESULTS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of pyrazosulfuron ethyl gave a single sharp peak at 3.41 min. The instrument detection limit (IDL) for pyrazosulfuron ethyl by HPLC was 0.1 µg mL(-1) , with a sensitivity of 2 ng. The estimated method detection limit (EMDL) was 0.001 µg mL(-1) and 0.002 µg g(-1) for water and soil respectively. Two applications at an interval of 10 days gave good weed control. The herbicide residues dissipated faster in water than in soil. In the present study, with a field-soil pH of 8.2 and an organic matter content of 0.5%, the pyrazosulfuron ethyl residues dissipated with a half-life of 5.4 and 0.9 days in soil and water respectively. Dissipation followed first-order kinetics. Under laboratory conditions, degradation of pyrazosulfuron ethyl was faster in non-sterile soil (t(1/2) = 9.7 days) than in sterile soil (t(1/2) = 16.9 days).

CONCLUSION: Pyrazosulfuron ethyl is a short-lived molecule, and it dissipated rapidly in field soil and water. The faster degradation of pyrazosulfuron in non-sterile soil than in sterile soil indicated microbial degradation of this herbicide.
22452575	Aluminum stress response in rice: effects on membrane lipid composition and expression of lipid biosynthesis genes.	2012	Physiol Plant	The presence of aluminum (Al) in acidic soils is a major abiotic stress limiting the production of cultivated plants. Cell membranes are the main targets of environmental stresses and there is growing evidence for the involvement of membrane lipids in plant adaptation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-long effects of Al on membrane lipid content and composition in the roots and shoots of rice plants grown under hydroponic conditions. Four rice cultivars were compared: two acknowledged as Al-resistant (Koshihikari) and Al-sensitive (Kasalath), respectively, and two Vietnamese cultivars, OM6073 and OM1490. Al treatment inhibited root and shoot growth in the sensitive cultivars and the observed changes in root and shoot lipid and fatty acid composition revealed patterns associated with Al sensitivity: larger decreases in lipid content and decreases in fatty acid unsaturation. In the roots, phospholipids, and particularly phosphatidylcholine (PC), decreased dramatically in the susceptible cultivars whereas the amount of lipid classes remained unchanged in the tolerant ones. In the shoots, the glycolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol as well as PC were mostly affected by Al treatment in the susceptible varieties. mRNA accumulation corresponding to genes coding for galactolipid synthases, enzymes of the PC and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthetic pathways and fatty acid desaturases correlated well with changes in lipid contents in roots and partly explained lipid changes in leaves. The results suggested that the capacity to maintain the proper functioning of some lipid biosynthetic activities and hence the stability of lipid composition may help the rice plant to withstand Al stress.
22325870	Functional conservation and diversification between rice OsMADS22/OsMADS55 and Arabidopsis SVP proteins.	2012	Plant Sci	MADS-box transcription factors play pivotal roles in several aspects of plant growth and development. The Arabidopsis SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) protein mediates the integration of signals involved in the control of flowering time and flower development by interacting with MADS-box proteins. In the rice genome, three SVP-like genes (OsMADS22, OsMADS47, and OsMADS55) are present. To investigate the functional conservation of these SVP-like genes in rice and Arabidopsis, the phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 were analyzed. Overexpression of OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 led to abnormal floral morphologies including leaf-like sepals, whereas only OsMADS55 expression caused delayed flowering via downregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that OsMADS22 and OsMADS55 interacted with Arabidopsis AGL24 and AP1, but only OsMADS55 interacted with FLC. Overexpression of OsMADS55, but not OsMADS22, complemented the early flowering phenotype and ambient temperature-insensitive flowering phenotype seen in svp mutants, suggesting that OsMADS55 regulates flowering time associated with ambient temperature responses in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our data are consistent with functional conservation and diversification between Arabidopsis and rice SVP-like genes involved in controlling flowering time and flower development.
22470057	Overexpression of rubisco activase decreases the photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate by reducing rubisco content in rice leaves.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The effects of overexpression of Rubisco activase on photosynthesis were studied in transgenic rice expressing barley or maize Rubisco activase. Immunoblot and SDS-PAGE analyses showed that transgenic lines from both gene constructs expressed the foreign Rubisco activase at high levels. The activation state of Rubisco in transgenic lines was slightly higher than that in non-transgenic plants (NT). In addition, light activation of Rubisco was significantly more rapid in transgenic lines compared with NT. These findings indicate that the overexpression of Rubisco activase can enhance Rubisco activation. However, despite enhanced activation of Rubisco in these transgenic plants, the CO(2) assimilation rate at ambient CO(2) conditions was decreased. This decrease in CO(2) assimilation rate was observed in both young developing and mature leaves independent of nitrogen nutrition. The contents of nitrogen and Chl did not differ significantly between transformants and NT; however, Rubisco content was substantially decreased in transgenic lines. There was no evidence for reduced transcription of RbcS or RbcL in these transgenic lines; in fact, transcript levels were marginally increased compared with NT. These results indicate that the overexpression of Rubisco activase leads to a decrease in Rubisco content, possibly due to post-transcriptional mechanisms.
22499169	Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	We report here the overexpression of Rab16A full length gene (promoter + ORF), from the salt-tolerant indica rice Pokkali, in the salt-susceptible indica rice variety Khitish, via particle bombardment. Molecular analysis of the transgenics revealed stable integration of the transgene upto T2 generation. High level of expression of the transgene (driven by its own stress-inducible promoter), as well as the protein, was detectable in the leaves under simulated salinity stress (250 mM NaCl, 24 h); the expression level being higher than wild type (WT) plants. The Rab16A transcript also increased gradually with seed maturity, with its maximal accumulation at 30 d after pollination (DAP) i.e., fully matured seeds, explaining the protective role of Rab16A gene during seed maturation. Enhanced tolerance to salinity was observed in the plants transformed with Rab16A. The superior physiological performances of the transgenics under salt treatment were also reflected in lesser shoot or root length inhibition, reduced chlorophyll damages, lesser accumulation of Na(+) and reduced loss of K(+), increased proline content as compared with the WT plants. All these results indicated that the overproduction of RAB16A protein in the transgenics enable them to display enhanced tolerance to salinity stress with improved physiological traits. Our work demonstrates the profound potential of Group 2 LEA proteins (to which RAB16A belongs to) in conferring stress tolerance in crop plants through their genetic manipulation.
22238157	The role of the oligosaccharide binding cleft of rice BGlu1 in hydrolysis of cellooligosaccharides and in their synthesis by rice BGlu1 glycosynthase.	2012	Protein Sci	Rice BGlu1 β-glucosidase nucleophile mutant E386G is a glycosynthase that can synthesize p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-cellooligosaccharides of up to 11 residues. The X-ray crystal structures of the E386G glycosynthase with and without α-glucosyl fluoride were solved and the α-glucosyl fluoride complex was found to contain an ordered water molecule near the position of the nucleophile of the BGlu1 native structure, which is likely to stabilize the departing fluoride. The structures of E386G glycosynthase in complexes with cellotetraose and cellopentaose confirmed that the side chains of N245, S334, and Y341 interact with glucosyl residues in cellooligosaccharide binding subsites +2, +3, and +4. Mutants in which these residues were replaced in BGlu1 β-glucosidase hydrolyzed cellotetraose and cellopentaose with k(cat) /K(m) values similar to those of the wild type enzyme. However, the Y341A, Y341L, and N245V mutants of the E386G glycosynthase synthesize shorter pNP-cellooligosaccharides than do the E386G glycosynthase and its S334A mutant, suggesting that Y341 and N245 play important roles in the synthesis of long oligosaccharides. X-ray structural studies revealed that cellotetraose binds to the Y341A mutant of the glycosynthase in a very different, alternative mode not seen in complexes with the E386G glycosynthase, possibly explaining the similar hydrolysis, but poorer synthesis of longer oligosaccharides by Y341 mutants.
22456953	Stress-induced expression of the transcription factor RERJ1 is tightly regulated in response to jasmonic acid accumulation in rice.	2013	Protoplasma	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) regulates various developmental processes and plant defence responses to environmental stresses. We previously reported that RERJ1, a JA-inducible transcription factor in rice, is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of RERJ1 after wounding is regulated in a JA-dependent manner in rice, based on histochemical analysis of RERJ1 promoter-GUS transgenic plants. RERJ1 expression was induced only at the region of injury after wounding, whereas expression was induced in the entire leaf after drought. According to JA measurements of stressed leaves, high accumulation of endogenous JA was only detected around the wound site in a rice leaves, whereas the drought treatment led to uniform accumulation of JA in the entire leaf, suggesting that RERJ1 will be a useful marker gene for studies on localization of JA in rice. Nuclear localization and transactivation ability of RERJ1 were also demonstrated. These results suggest that RERJ1 plays a role as a transcriptional activator for regulating stress-inducible gene expression, with a strong correlation to JA accumulation in the stressed region.
22389198	Extract of fermented brown rice induces apoptosis of human colorectal tumor cells by activating mitochondrial pathway.	2012	Phytother Res	Brown rice fermented with Aspergillus oryzae, designated as FBRA, is a dietary fiber-rich food, and fully appreciated as one of the prebiotics, which are generally considered to be beneficial to the health of the body, because of stimulating the growth and/or the activity of bacteria in the digestive system. To assess the effectiveness of FBRA as a functional food, the direct effect of FBRA extract on human colorectal tumor cells was examined. The exposure of HCT116 cells to FBRA extract reduced their viabilities in a concentration-dependent manner, and the reduction of the cell viability might be attributed to the induction of apoptosis probably through the oxidative damage to the cells. Further studies showed that FBRA extract caused a significant elevation of Bax protein and a slight reduction of Bcl2 protein levels, and furthermore caused the activation of caspase-3 in the cells. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that FBRA extract can exert oxidative damage to the cells, resulting in apoptotic cell death by activating the mitochondrial pathway in human colorectal tumor cells. Therefore, daily intake of FBRA can be expected to be beneficial for preventing carcinogenesis and/or suppressing tumor growth in the digestive tract.
22136218	Comparative analysis of root transcriptome profiles of two pairs of drought-tolerant and susceptible rice near-isogenic lines under different drought stress.	2011	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Plant roots are important organs to uptake soil water and nutrients, perceiving and transducing of soil water deficit signals to shoot. The current knowledge of drought stress transcriptomes in rice are mostly relying on comparative studies of diverse genetic background under drought. A more reliable approach is to use near-isogenic lines (NILs) with a common genetic background but contrasting levels of resistance to drought stress under initial exposure to water deficit. Here, we examined two pairs of NILs in IR64 background with contrasting drought tolerance. We obtained gene expression profile in roots of rice NILs under different levels of drought stress help to identify genes and mechanisms involved in drought stress.

RESULTS: Global gene expression analysis showed that about 55% of genes differentially expressed in roots of rice in response to drought stress treatments. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased in NILs as the level of water deficits, increased from mild to severe condition, suggesting that more genes were affected by increasing drought stress. Gene onthology (GO) test and biological pathway analysis indicated that activated genes in the drought tolerant NILs IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 and IR77298-5-6-B-18 were mostly involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, response to stimulus, defence response, transcription and signal transduction, and down-regulated genes were involved in photosynthesis and cell wall growth. We also observed gibberellic acid (GA) and auxin crosstalk modulating lateral root formation in the tolerant NILs.

CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptome analysis on two pairs of NILs with a common genetic background (~97%) showed distinctive differences in gene expression profiles and could be effective to unravel genes involved in drought tolerance. In comparison with the moderately tolerant NIL IR77298-5-6-B-18 and other susceptible NILs, the tolerant NIL IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 showed a greater number of DEGs for cell growth, hormone biosynthesis, cellular transports, amino acid metabolism, signalling, transcription factors and carbohydrate metabolism in response to drought stress treatments. Thus, different mechanisms are achieving tolerance in the two tolerant lines.
22157085	Sucrose efflux mediated by SWEET proteins as a key step for phloem transport.	2012	Science	Plants transport fixed carbon predominantly as sucrose, which is produced in mesophyll cells and imported into phloem cells for translocation throughout the plant. It is not known how sucrose migrates from sites of synthesis in the mesophyll to the phloem, or which cells mediate efflux into the apoplasm as a prerequisite for phloem loading by the SUT sucrose-H(+) (proton) cotransporters. Using optical sucrose sensors, we identified a subfamily of SWEET sucrose efflux transporters. AtSWEET11 and 12 localize to the plasma membrane of the phloem. Mutant plants carrying insertions in AtSWEET11 and 12 are defective in phloem loading, thus revealing a two-step mechanism of SWEET-mediated export from parenchyma cells feeding H(+)-coupled import into the sieve element-companion cell complex. We discuss how restriction of intercellular transport to the interface of adjacent phloem cells may be an effective mechanism to limit the availability of photosynthetic carbon in the leaf apoplasm in order to prevent pathogen infections.
22271304	Metabolic profiling based on LC/MS to evaluate unintended effects of transgenic rice with cry1Ac and sck genes.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	As a primary characteristic of substantial equivalence, the evaluation of unintended effects of genetically modified plants has been evolving into an important field of research. In this study, a metabolic profiling method for rice seeds was developed using rapid resolution liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The analytical properties of the method, including the linearity, reproducibility, intra-day precision and inter-day precision, were investigated and were found to be satisfactory. The method was then applied to investigate the differences between transgenic rice and its native counterparts, in addition to the differences found between native rice with different sowing dates or locations. Global metabolic phenotype differences were visualized, and metabolites from different discriminated groups were discovered using multivariate data analysis. The results indicated that environmental factors played a greater role than gene modification for most metabolites, including tryptophan, 9,10,13-trihydroxyoctadec-11-enoic acid, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine 16:0. The concentrations of phytosphingosine, palmitic acid, 5-hydroxy-2-octadenoic acid and three other unidentified metabolites varied slightly due to gene modification.
22363605	Different localization patterns of anthocyanin species in the pericarp of black rice revealed by imaging mass spectrometry.	2012	PLoS One	Black rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica) contains high levels of anthocyanins in the pericarp and is considered an effective health-promoting food. Several studies have identified the molecular species of anthocyanins in black rice, but information about the localization of each anthocyanin species is limited because methodologies for investigating the localization such as determining specific antibodies to anthocyanin, have not yet been developed Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) is a suitable tool for investigating the localization of metabolites. In this study, we identified 7 species of anthocyanin monoglycosides and 2 species of anthocyanin diglycosides in crude extracts from black rice by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis. We also analyzed black rice sections by MALDI-IMS and found 2 additional species of anthocyanin pentosides and revealed different localization patterns of anthocyanin species composed of different sugar moieties. Anthocyanin species composed of a pentose moiety (cyanidin-3-O-pentoside and petunidin-3-O-pentoside) were localized in the entire pericarp, whereas anthocyanin species composed of a hexose moiety (cyanidin-3-O-hexoside and peonidin-3-O-hexoside) were focally localized in the dorsal pericarp. These results indicate that anthocyanin species composed of different sugar moieties exhibit different localization patterns in the pericarp of black rice. This is the first detailed investigation into the localization of molecular species of anthocyanins by MALDI-IMS.
22289080	Light-regulated melatonin biosynthesis in rice during the senescence process in detached leaves.	2012	J Pineal Res	The effect of light on melatonin biosynthesis was examined in detached rice (Oryza sativa cv. Asahi) leaves during the senescence process. The detached leaves were exposed to senescence treatment either in constant darkness or in constant light, and subjected to HPLC analysis for melatonin and its precursors. Higher melatonin levels were detected in rice leaves under constant light while very low levels were observed in constant darkness. Levels of the melatonin intermediates, tryptamine, serotonin, and N-acetylserotonin significantly decreased in the dark compared to those in the light. Furthermore, relative mRNA levels of melatonin biosynthetic genes and their corresponding proteins decreased accordingly in constant darkness. The most striking difference between constant light and dark was observed in levels of the protein tryptamine 5-hydroxylase. These results suggest that melatonin biosynthesis during senescence is dependent on light signals in rice leaves, contrary to the response found in animals.
22257308	The ColRS system of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is required for virulence and growth in iron-limiting conditions.	2012	Mol Plant Pathol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, produces siderophores only under iron-limiting conditions. We screened 15 400 mTn5-induced mutants of X. oryzae pv. oryzae and isolated 27 mutants that produced siderophores even under iron-replete conditions. We found that the mTn5 insertions in 25 of these mutants were in or close to six genes. Mutants with insertions in five of these genes [colS, XOO1806 (a conserved hypothetical protein), acnB, prpR and prpB] exhibited a deficiency for growth on iron-limiting medium and a decrease in virulence. Insertions in a sixth gene, XOO0007 (a conserved hypothetical protein), were found to affect the ability to grow on iron-limiting medium, but did not affect the virulence. Targeted gene disruptants for colR (encoding the predicted cognate regulatory protein for ColS) also exhibited a deficiency for growth on iron-limiting medium and a decrease in virulence. colR and colS mutants were defective in the elicitation of hypersensitive response symptoms on the nonhost tomato. In addition, colR and colS mutants induced a rice basal defence response, suggesting that they are compromised in the suppression of host innate immunity. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that a functional ColRS system is required for the optimal expression of several genes encoding components of the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Our results demonstrate the role of several novel genes, including colR/colS, in the promotion of growth on iron-limiting medium and the virulence of X. oryzae pv. oryzae.
22384086	Fructose-bisphophate aldolase exhibits functional roles between carbon metabolism and the hrp system in rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola.	2012	PLoS One	Fructose-bisphophate aldolase (FbaB), is an enzyme in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in living organisms. The mutagenesis in a unique fbaB gene of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal agent of rice bacterial leaf streak, led the pathogen not only unable to use pyruvate and malate for growth and delayed its growth when fructose was used as the sole carbon source, but also reduced extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production and impaired bacterial virulence and growth in rice. Intriguingly, the fbaB promoter contains an imperfect PIP-box (plant-inducible promoter) (TTCGT-N(9)-TTCGT). The expression of fbaB was negatively regulated by a key hrp regulatory HrpG and HrpX cascade. Base substitution in the PIP-box altered the regulation of fbaB with the cascade. Furthermore, the expression of fbaB in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola RS105 strain was inducible in planta rather than in a nutrient-rich medium. Except other hrp-hrc-hpa genes, the expression of hrpG and hrpX was repressed and the transcripts of hrcC, hrpE and hpa3 were enhanced when fbaB was deleted. The mutation in hrcC, hrpE or hpa3 reduced the ability of the pathogen to acquire pyruvate and malate. In addition, bacterial virulence and growth in planta and EPS production in RΔfbaB mutant were completely restored to the wild-type level by the presence of fbaB in trans. This is the first report to demonstrate that carbohydrates, assimilated by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, play critical roles in coordinating hrp gene expression through a yet unknown regulator.
22252123	Field response of aboveground non-target arthropod community to transgenic Bt-Cry1Ab rice plant residues in postharvest seasons.	2012	Transgenic Res	Risk assessments of ecological effects of transgenic rice expressing lepidoptera-Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) on non-target arthropods have primarily focused on rice plants during cropping season, whereas few studies have investigated the effects in postharvest periods. Harvested rice fallow fields provide a critical over-wintering habitat for arthropods in the Chinese rice ecosystems, particularly in the southern region of the country. During 2006-08, two independent field trials were conducted in Chongqing, China to investigate the effects of transgenic Cry1Ab rice residues on non-target arthropod communities. In each trial, pitfall traps were used to sample arthropods in field plots planted with one non-Bt variety and two Bt rice lines expressing the Cry1Ab protein. Aboveground arthropods in the trial plots during the postharvest season were abundant, while community densities varied significantly between the two trials. A total of 52,386 individual insects and spiders, representing 93 families, was captured in the two trials. Predominant arthropods sampled were detritivores, which accounted for 91.9% of the total captures. Other arthropods sampled included predators (4.2%), herbivores (3.2%), and parasitoids (0.7%). In general, there were no significant differences among non-Bt and Bt rice plots in all arthropod community-specific parameters for both trials, suggesting no adverse impact of the Bt rice plant residues on the aboveground non-target arthropod communities during the postharvest season. The results of this study provide additional evidence that Bt rice is safe to non-target arthropod communities in the Chinese rice ecosystems.
22468358	Multiplex, construct-specific, and real-time PCR-based analytical methods for Bt rice with cry1Ac gene.	None	J AOAC Int	Qualitative and quantitative analytical methods based on PCR for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice hybrid, namely, MRP 5401 Bt expressing a modified version of the Bt cry1Ac gene, are reported here. Multiplex PCR assays were developed to target the cry1Ac transgene, Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase (nos) terminator, the neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptLL) marker gene, and an endogenous a-tubulin (TubA) gene in Bt rice. The 3.178 kb region of inserted gene construct comprising the region of the CaMV 35S promoter and cry1Ac gene was amplified, and the construct integrity was confirmed by the nested PCR. The LOD for cry1Ac gene-specific simplex PCR was 0.01%, as established using Bt rice DNA dilutions with 100, 10, 1.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001% genetically modified trait. A real-time PCR assay was also developed to quantify the cry1Ac gene. The method performance of the reported real-time PCR assay was in line with the acceptance criteria of Codex Alimentarius Commission ALINORM 10/33/23, with LOD and LOQ values of 0.05%. The reliable PCR assays prior to commercial release of Bt rice would facilitate efficient regulatory compliance for identification of genetic trait, labeling requirements, and effective risk assessment and management. They could also address consumers' concerns and legal disputes that may arise.
22361804	Transgenic rice grains expressing a heterologous ρ-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase shift tocopherol synthesis from the γ to the α isoform without increasing absolute tocopherol levels.	2012	Transgenic Res	We generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana ρ-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), which catalyzes the first committed step in vitamin E biosynthesis. Transgenic grains accumulated marginally higher levels of total tocochromanols than controls, reflecting a small increase in absolute tocotrienol synthesis (but no change in the relative abundance of the α and γ isoforms). In contrast, there was no change in the absolute tocopherol level, but a significant shift from the γ to the α isoform. These data confirm HPPD is not rate limiting, and that increasing flux through the early pathway reveals downstream bottlenecks that act as metabolic tipping points.
22446601	High-level expression of modified gene encoding human adiponectin in transgenic rice.	2011	Biol Res	Adiponectin is a polypeptide specifically secreted from human adipocytes, and its deficiency is closely linked to increased obesity and type II diabetes. There is an urgent demand for large-scale production of human adiponectin for pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report that we have successfully obtained a high-level of expression of modified genes encoding human adiponectin in transgenic rice. The 735 bp cDNA of the native human sequence was adopted to rice codon usage, fused to the translation initiation sequence in the N terminus and to the KDEL signal sequence in the C terminus. An amplification promoting sequence acting as an enhancer of transcription was also introduced to enhance gene expression. The presence of the transgene and mRNA transcripts was confirmed by PCR, Southern blot and RT-PCR. Western blot analysis revealed that a protein of approximately 30 kDa was produced in rice leaves. ELISA analysis was used to determine the amount of recombinant adiponectin in transformants with the modified gene in up to 0.32% of total soluble leaf protein. Our results establish the feasibility of high-level expression of recombinant human adiponectin in transgenic rice.
22195579	Agro-morphological characterization of a population of introgression lines derived from crosses between IR 64 (Oryza sativa indica) and TOG 5681 (Oryza glaberrima) for drought tolerance.	2012	Plant Sci	The study evaluated effects of drought on some agro-morphological traits of 60 rice genotypes comprising 54 introgression lines with their parents, IR 64 (Oryza sativa) and TOG 5681 (Oryza glaberrima) and four NERICA-L varieties developed from the same parents for comparison. The genotypes were subjected either to full irrigation from sowing to maturity (control) or to 21-day drought applied by stopping irrigation from the 45th day after sowing (DAS) onward (drought) in the dry seasons of 2006 and 2007-2008. Plant height, spikelet fertility, grain yield and leaf area at harvesting were consistently reduced by drought in both seasons. Values of leaf temperature, leaf rolling, leaf tip drying, leaf blast, days from seeding to flowering and maturity were higher under drought. The results on SPAD and number of tillers were not consistent. Significant relationship (P<0.05) was observed between all traits evaluated and grain yield under drought. Introgression lines, SEN-L13-2, MPL-15-3, SEN-L10-1, SEN-L26-3 and SEN-L21-2 showed significantly higher yield than the highest yield NERICA-L variety (all of them had higher yield than the parents). Among them, SEN-L13-2 showed the lowest yield loss by drought and MPL-15-3 had high yield potential and considerably low yield loss by drought.
22334645	FLOWERING BHLH transcriptional activators control expression of the photoperiodic flowering regulator CONSTANS in Arabidopsis.	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Many plants monitor day-length changes throughout the year and use the information to precisely regulate the timing of seasonal flowering for maximum reproductive success. In Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptional regulation of the CONSTANS (CO) gene and posttranslational regulation of CO protein are crucial mechanisms for proper day-length measurement in photoperiodic flowering. Currently, the CYCLING DOF FACTOR proteins are the only transcription factors known to directly regulate CO gene expression, and the mechanisms that directly activate CO transcription have remained unknown. Here we report the identification of four CO transcriptional activators, named FLOWERING BHLH 1 (FBH1), FBH2, FBH3, and FBH4. All FBH proteins are related basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors that preferentially bind to the E-box cis-elements in the CO promoter. Overexpression of all FBH genes drastically elevated CO levels and caused early flowering regardless of photoperiod, whereas CO levels were reduced in the fbh quadruple mutants. In addition, FBH1 is expressed in the vascular tissue and bound near the transcription start site of the CO promoter in vivo. Furthermore, FBH homologs in poplar and rice induced CO expression in Arabidopsis. These results indicate that FBH proteins positively regulate CO transcription for photoperiodic flowering and that this mechanism may be conserved in diverse plant species. Our results suggest that the diurnal CO expression pattern is generated by a concert of redundant functions of positive and negative transcriptional regulators.
22418094	Rice BGlu1 glycosynthase and wild type transglycosylation activities distinguished by cyclophellitol inhibition.	2012	Carbohydr Res	The rice BGlu1 β-D-glucosidase nucleophile mutant E386G is a glycosynthase that catalyzes the synthesis of cellooligosaccharides from α-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride (GlcF) donor and p-nitrophenyl (pNP) cellobioside (Glc2-pNP) or cello-oligosaccharide acceptors. When activity with other donors and acceptors was tested, the initial enzyme preparation cleaved pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside (Glc-pNP) and pNP-β-D-fucopyranoside (Fuc-pNP) to pNP and glucose and fucose, suggesting contamination with wild type BGlu1 β-glucosidase. The products from reaction of GlcF and Fuc-pNP included Fuc-β-(1→3)-Fuc-pNP, Glc-β-(1→3)-Fuc-pNP, and Fuc-β-(1→4)-Glc-β-(1→3)-Fuc-pNP, suggesting the presence of both wild type BGlu1 and its glycosynthase. Inhibition of the BGlu1 β-glucosidase activity within this preparation by cyclophellitol confirmed that the E386G glycosynthase preparation was contaminated with wild type BGlu1. Rice BGlu1 E386G-2, generated from a new construct designed to minimize back-mutation, showed glycosynthase activity without wild type hydrolytic or transglycosylation activity. E386G-2 catalyzed transfer of glycosyl residues from GlcF, α-L-arabinosyl fluoride, α-D-fucosyl fluoride, α-D-galactosyl fluoride, α-D-mannosyl fluoride, and α-D-xylosyl fluoride donors to Glc2-pNP acceptor. The synthetic products from the reactions of α-fucosyl fluoride and α-mannosyl fluoride donors were confirmed to result from addition of a β-(1→4)-linked glycosyl residue. Moreover, the E386G glycosynthase transferred glucose from GlcF donor to glucose, cellobiose, Glc-pNP, Fuc-pNP, pNP-β-D-galactopyranoside, and pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside acceptors, but little to pNP-β-D-mannopyranoside. Production of longer oligosaccharides occurred most readily on acceptors with an equatorial 4-OH. Elimination of wild type contamination thereby allowed a clear assessment of BGlu1 E386G glycosynthase catalytic abilities.
22305189	PhosphoRice: a meta-predictor of rice-specific phosphorylation sites.	2012	Plant Methods	BACKGROUND: As a result of the growing body of protein phosphorylation sites data, the number of phosphoprotein databases is constantly increasing, and dozens of tools are available for predicting protein phosphorylation sites to achieve fast automatic results. However, none of the existing tools has been developed to predict protein phosphorylation sites in rice.

RESULTS: In this paper, the phosphorylation site predictors, NetPhos 2.0, NetPhosK, Kinasephos, Scansite, Disphos and Predphosphos, were integrated to construct meta-predictors of rice-specific phosphorylation sites using several methods, including unweighted voting, unreduced weighted voting, reduced unweighted voting and weighted voting strategies. PhosphoRice, the meta-predictor produced by using weighted voting strategy with parameters selected by restricted grid search and conditional random search, performed the best at predicting phosphorylation sites in rice. Its Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Accuracy (ACC) reached to 0.474 and 73.8%, respectively. Compared to the best individual element predictor (Disphos_default), PhosphoRice archieved a significant increase in MCC of 0.071 (P < 0.01), and an increase in ACC of 4.6%.

CONCLUSIONS: PhosphoRice is a powerful tool for predicting unidentified phosphorylation sites in rice. Compared to the existing methods, we found that our tool showed greater robustness in ACC and MCC. PhosphoRice is available to the public at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/PhosphoRice.
22417733	Leaf ascorbic acid level--is it really important for ozone tolerance in rice?	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Leaf ascorbic acid (ASA) level is thought to be an important trait conferring stress tolerance in plants, but definite evidence regarding its effectiveness in the breeding of stress tolerant crops is lacking. Therefore, the stress response of a rice TOS17 insertion mutant (ND6172) for a GDP-D-mannose-3',5'-epimerase gene, which is involved in ASA biosynthesis, was tested. Two fumigation experiments were conducted, in which rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) were exposed to (i) high ozone for ten days at the tillering stage (100 ppb, 7 h day⁻¹); and (ii) to four different ozone concentrations ranging from charcoal filtered air to 2.5 times the ambient concentration for the entire growth season. The mutant ND6172 had around 20-30% lower ASA level than the wild-type (Nipponbare), and exhibited a moderately higher level of visible leaf symptoms due to ozone exposure. Differences in ASA level between ND6172 and Nipponbare led to differential responses of the glutathione level, and the activities of glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, and dehydroascorbate reductase. With season-long ozone fumigation, yields and yield components were not negatively affected at ambient ozone level in both genotypes, but showed stronger decreases in ND6172 at higher ozone levels, especially at 2.5 times the ambient level. Similarly, the mature straw of ND6172 exhibited a higher degree of lignification at the 2.5 times ambient ozone level. In conclusion, a difference in leaf ASA level of around 20-30% is relevant for ozone tolerance in rice at levels exceeding the current ambient ozone concentrations.
22349461	Photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility in rice are caused by a point mutation in a novel noncoding RNA that produces a small RNA.	2012	Cell Res	Photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (PGMS and TGMS) are the core components for hybrid breeding in crops. Hybrid rice based on the two-line system using PGMS and TGMS lines has been successfully developed and applied widely in agriculture. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of PGMS and TGMS remains obscure. In this study, we mapped and cloned a major locus, p/tms12-1 (photo- or thermo-sensitive genic male sterility locus on chromosome 12), which confers PGMS in the japonica rice line Nongken 58S (NK58S) and TGMS in the indica rice line Peiai 64S (PA64S, derived from NK58S). A 2.4-kb DNA fragment containing the wild-type allele P/TMS12-1 was able to restore the pollen fertility of NK58S and PA64S plants in genetic complementation. P/TMS12-1 encodes a unique noncoding RNA, which produces a 21-nucleotide small RNA that we named osa-smR5864w. A substitution of C-to-G in p/tms12-1, the only polymorphism relative to P/TMS12-1, is present in the mutant small RNA, namely osa-smR5864m. Furthermore, overexpression of a 375-bp sequence of P/TMS12-1 in transgenic NK58S and PA64S plants also produced osa-smR5864w and restored pollen fertility. The small RNA was expressed preferentially in young panicles, but its expression was not markedly affected by different day lengths or temperatures. Our results reveal that the point mutation in p/tms12-1, which probably leads to a loss-of-function for osa-smR5864m, constitutes a common cause for PGMS and TGMS in the japonica and indica lines, respectively. Our findings thus suggest that this noncoding small RNA gene is an important regulator of male development controlled by cross-talk between the genetic networks and environmental conditions.
22382062	[Molecular characteristics and specific PCR detection of transgenic rice containing Cry1Ab].	2012	Yi Chuan	Bt01 is a new type of rice that has been genetically modified to express Cry1Abprotein. This study confirmed that Cry1Abwas inserted into Bt01 as a single copy using Southern blotting analysis. TAIL-PCR method was further used to obtain its insertion site information. Specific PCR primers and TaqMan probes were designed based on the 5'-integration junction sequence of transgenic rice Bt01. The results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) was ten copies in qualitative PCR. The quantitative PCR assay showed that the LOD was five copies, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was ten cop-ies. In addition, the accuracy of the established quantitative PCR was verified by detecting two samples containing 3% and 0.5%Bt01, respectively. The quantitative PCR analysis showed the results were 2.7% and 0.47%, respectively.The above results indicated that the event-specific PCR methods developed have high specificity and good sensitivity, which could be effective methods for identifying and testing the genetically modified Bt01 rice.
22470056	Rice carotenoid β-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Lutein is the most abundant plant carotenoid and plays essential roles in photosystem assembly and stabilization, as well as protection against photostress. To date, only a few lutein biosynthesis genes have been identified in crop plants. In this study, the rice Cyt P450 gene CYP97A4 encoding a carotenoid β-ring hydroxylase was shown to be involved in lutein biosynthesis. The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts. Compared with the wild type, the three allelic mutants of CYP97A4 displayed lutein reductions of 12-24% with substantially increased α-carotene, while Chl a/b levels were unaltered. The increased α-carotene in the mutants led to greater sensitivity under high light stress. Similarly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) imaging of leaves treated with intense light showed that the mutants generally accumulated greater levels of ROS compared with wild-type plants, which probably caused detrimental effects to the plant photosystem. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the important role of CYP97A4 in α-carotene hydroxylation in rice, and knock-out of the gene reduced lutein and increased α-carotene, contributing to sensitivity to intense light.
22462395	Comparative proteomic analysis of early salt stress-responsive proteins in roots of SnRK2 transgenic rice.	2012	Proteome Sci	BACKGROUND: The rice roots are highly salt-sensitive organ and primary root growth is rapidly suppressed by salt stress. Sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase2 (SnRK2) family is one of the key regulator of hyper-osmotic stress signalling in various plant cells. To understand early salt response of rice roots and identify SnRK2 signaling components, proteome changes of transgenic rice roots over-expressing OSRK1, a rice SnRK2 kinase were investigated.

RESULTS: Proteomes were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and protein spots were identified by LC-MS/MS from wild type and OSRK1 transgenic rice roots exposed to 150 mM NaCl for either 3 h or 7 h. Fifty two early salt -responsive protein spots were identified from wild type rice roots. The major up-regulated proteins were enzymes related to energy regulation, amino acid metabolism, methylglyoxal detoxification, redox regulation and protein turnover. It is noted that enzymes known to be involved in GA-induced root growth such as fructose bisphosphate aldolase and methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase were clearly down-regulated. In contrast to wild type rice roots, only a few proteins were changed by salt stress in OSRK1 transgenic rice roots. A comparative quantitative analysis of the proteome level indicated that forty three early salt-responsive proteins were magnified in transgenic rice roots at unstressed condition. These proteins contain single or multiple potential SnRK2 recognition motives. In vitro kinase assay revealed that one of the identified proteome, calreticulin is a good substrate of OSRK1.

CONCLUSIONS: Our present data implicate that rice roots rapidly changed broad spectrum of energy metabolism upon challenging salt stress, and suppression of GA signaling by salt stress may be responsible for the rapid arrest of root growth and development. The broad spectrum of functional categories of proteins affected by over-expression of OSRK1 indicates that OSRK1 is an upstream regulator of stress signaling in rice roots. Enzymes involved in glycolysis, branched amino acid catabolism, dnaK-type molecular chaperone, calcium binding protein, Sal T and glyoxalase are potential targets of OSRK1 in rice roots under salt stress that need to be further investigated.
22494411	Modulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis by water stress in rice seedlings during chloroplast biogenesis.	2012	Plant Cell Environ	To understand the impact of water stress on the greening process, water stress was applied to 6-day-old etiolated seedlings of a drought-sensitive cultivar of rice (Oryza sativa), Pusa Basmati-1 by immersing their roots in 40 mm polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (-0.69 MPa) or 50 mm PEG 6000 (-1.03 MPa) dissolved in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS)-nutrient-solution, 16 h prior to transfer to cool-white-fluorescent + incandescent light. Chlorophyll (Chl) accumulation substantially declined in developing water-stressed seedlings. Reduced Chl synthesis was due to decreased accumulation of chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediates, that is, glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA), 5-aminolevulinic acid, Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester and protochlorophyllide. Although 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis decreased, the gene expression and protein abundance of the enzyme responsible for its synthesis, GSA aminotransferase, increased, suggesting its crucial role in the greening process in stressful environment. The biochemical activities of Chl biosynthetic enzymes, that is, 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, porphobilinogen deaminase, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, porphyrinogen IX oxidase, Mg-chelatase and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, were down-regulated due to their reduced protein abundance/gene expression in water-stressed seedlings. Down-regulation of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase resulted in impaired Shibata shift. Our results demonstrate that reduced synthesis of early intermediates, that is, GSA and 5-aminolevulinic acid, could modulate the gene expression of later enzymes of Chl biosynthesis pathway.
22448681	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny.	2012	Plant J	Genes that promote DNA methylation and demethylation in plants have been characterized mainly in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis DNA demethylation is mediated by bi-functional DNA enzymes with glycosylase activity that removes 5-methylcytosine and lyase activity that nicks double-stranded DNA at an abasic site. Homologous recombination-promoted knock-in targeting of the ROS1a gene, the longest of six putative DNA demethylase genes in the rice genome, by fusing its endogenous promoter to the GUS reporter gene, led to reproducibly disrupted ROS1a in primary (T(0)) transgenic plants in the heterozygous condition. These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells. Interestingly, neither the maternal nor paternal knock-in null allele, ros1a-GUS1, was virtually detected in the progeny; such an intransmittable null mutation is difficult to isolate by conventional mutagenesis techniques that are usually used to identify and isolate mutants in the progeny population. Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development. The paternal ros1a-GUS1 allele was not transmitted to progeny, presumably because of a male gametophytic defect(s) prior to fertilization. Thus, ROS1a is indispensable in both male and female gametophytes, and DNA demethylation must plays important roles in both gametophytes.
22414560	Retrotransposon insertions in rice gene pairs associated with reduced conservation of gene pairs in grass genomes.	2012	Genomics	Small-scale changes in gene order and orientation are common in plant genomes, even across relatively short evolutionary distances. We investigated the association of retrotransposons in and near rice gene pairs with gene pair conservation, inversion, rearrangement, and deletion in sorghum, maize, and Brachypodium. Copia and Gypsy LTR-retrotransposon insertions were found to be primarily associated with reduced frequency of gene pair conservation and an increase in both gene pair rearrangement and gene deletions. SINEs are associated with gene pair rearrangement, while LINEs are associated with gene deletions. Despite being more frequently associated with retrotransposons than convergent and tandem pairs, divergent gene pairs showed the least effects from that association. In contrast, convergent pairs were least frequently associated with retrotransposons yet showed the greatest effects. Insertions between genes were associated with the greatest effects on gene pair arrangement, while insertions flanking gene pairs had significant effects only on divergent pairs.
22388917	Two novel positive cis-regulatory elements involved in green tissue-specific promoter activity in rice (Oryza sativa L ssp.).	2012	Plant Cell Rep	UNLABELLED: In plant genetic engineering, using tissue-specific promoters to control the expression of target gene is an effective way to avoid potential negative effects of using constitutive promoter, such as metabolic burden and so on. However, until now, there are few tissue-specific promoters with strong and reliable expression that could be used in crop biotechnology application. In this study, based on microarray and RT-PCR data, we identified a rice green tissue-specific expression gene DX1 (LOC_Os12g33120). The expression pattern of DX1 gene promoter was examined by using the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and analyzed in transgenic rice plants in different tissues. Histochemical assays and quantitative analyses of GUS activity confirmed that P (DX1):GUS was highly expressed in green tissues. To identify the regulatory elements controlling the expression of the DX1 gene, a series of 5' and 3' deletions of DX1 promoter were fused to GUS gene and stably introduced into rice plants. In addition, gel mobility shift assays and site-directed mutagenesis studies were used, allowing for the identification of two novel tissue-specific cis-acting elements (GSE1 and GSE2) within P(DX1). GSE1 acted as a positive regulator in all green tissues (leaf, sheath, stem and panicle). Compared with GSE1, GSE2 acted as a positive regulator only in sheath and stem tissue, and had a weaker effect on gene expression. In addition, P(DX1):GUS was not expressed in anther and seed, this characteristic reduced the potential ecological risk and potential food safety issues. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the identified promoter, P(DX1), and its cis regulatory elements, GSE1 and GSE2, are potentially useful in the field of rice transgenic breeding.

KEY MESSAGE: We have isolated and characterized the rice green tissue-specific promoter P(DX1), and identified two novel positive cis-acting elements in P(DX1).
22419106	A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	The role of flavonoids as the major red, blue, purple and brown pigments in plants has gained these secondary products a great deal of attention over the years. In this study, we characterized a rice inhibitor for brown furrows1 (ibf1) mutant. In the ibf1 mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in hull furrows during seed maturation and reach a maximum level in dry seeds. Higher amounts of total flavonoids and anthocyanin in hull may be responsible for the brown pigmentation of ibf1. The IBF1 gene, which encodes a similar kelch repeat-containing F-box protein, was isolated by map-based cloning approach. Real-time RT-PCR and GUS activity assays revealed that IBF1 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues. GFP-IBF1 fusion protein mainly localized in cytoplasm. The expression of some major structural enzymatic genes involved in flavonoids biosynthesis could be up- or down-regulated to some different extent in ibf1 mutant. Our data suggested that IBF1 as a suppressor could inhibit the brown pigmentation of rice hull furrows.
22458212	Mechanisms of Oryza sativa (Poaceae) resistance to Tagosodes orizicolus (Homoptera: Delphacidae) under greenhouse condition in Venezuela.	2012	Rev Biol Trop	Tagosodes orizicolus is one of the main plagues of rice in tropical America causing two types of damages, the direct one, feeding and oviposition effect, and an indirect one, by the transmission of the "Rice hoja blanca virus". During 2006-2007 we carried out research under greenhouse conditions at Fundaci6n Danac, Venezuela, in order to determine the mechanisms of antixenosis, antibiosis and tolerance to T. orizicolus, which could be acting in commercial varieties and advanced lines of the rice genetic breeding programs of INIA and Fundaci6n Danac. The method of free feeding was used for the antixenosis evaluation, whereas the method of forced feeding was used for antibiosis evaluation (effect on survival and oviposition). Additionally, we used the indirect method based on biomass depression to estimate the tolerance. Some of the evaluated traits included: grade of damage, number of insects settling on rice plants, percentage of sogata mortality at the mature state, number of eggs in the leaf midrib and an index of tolerance. The results showed that rice genotypes possess different combinations of resistance mechanisms, as well as different grades of reactions. The susceptible control 'Bluebonnet 50' was consistently susceptible across experiments and the resistant control 'Makalioka' had high antixenosis and high antibiosis based on survival and oviposition. The rest of the genotypes presented lower or higher degrees of antixenosis and antibiosis for survival and oviposition. The genotype 'FD0241-M-17-6-1-1-1-1' was identified with possible tolerance to the direct damage of sogata.
22446930	A multiple gene complex on rice chromosome 4 is involved in durable resistance to rice blast.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to rice blast offer a potential source of durable disease resistance in rice. However, few QTLs have been validated in progeny testing, on account of their small phenotypic effects. To understand the genetic basis for QTL-mediated resistance to blast, we dissected a resistance QTL, qBR4-2, using advanced backcross progeny derived from a chromosome segment substitution line in which a 30- to 34-Mb region of chromosome 4 from the resistant cultivar Owarihatamochi was substituted into the genetic background of the highly susceptible Aichiasahi. The analysis resolved qBR4-2 into three loci, designated qBR4-2a, qBR4-2b, and qBR4-2c. The sequences of qBR4-2a and qBR4-2b, which lie 181 kb apart from each other and measure, 113 and 32 kb, respectively, appear to encode proteins with a putative nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Sequence analysis of the donor allele of qBR4-2a, the region with the largest effect among the three, revealed sequence variations in the NBS-LRR region. The effect of qBR4-2c was smallest among the three, but its combination with the donor alleles of qBR4-2a and qBR4-2b significantly enhanced blast resistance. qBR4-2 comprises three tightly linked QTLs that control blast resistance in a complex manner, and thus gene pyramiding or haplotype selection is the recommended strategy for improving QTL-mediated resistance to blast disease through the use of this chromosomal region.
22146734	Expression of the Arabidopsis borate efflux transporter gene, AtBOR4, in rice affects the xylem loading of boron and tolerance to excess boron.	2011	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Boron is an essential nutrient for plants, but it is toxic in excess. Transgenic rice plants expressing an Arabidopsis thaliana borate efflux transporter gene, AtBOR4, at a low level exhibited increased tolerance to excess boron. Those lines with high levels of expression exhibited reduced growth. These findings suggest a potential of the borate transporter BOR4 for the generation of high-boron tolerant rice.
22403871	Protocol for in vitro somatic embryogenesis and regeneration of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Indian J Exp Biol	Development of highly efficient and reproducible plant regeneration system has tremendous potential to provide improved technology to assist in genetic transformation of indica rice cultivars for their further exploitation in selection. For the development of a highly reproducible regeneration system through somatic embryogenesis, mature embryos of highly popular rice cultivars i.e., Govind (for rainfed areas), Pusa Basmati-1 (aromatic basmati) and Jaya (for irrigated areas) were used. Optimum callus formation (%) to MS medium supplemented with 2, 4-D was obtained at 12.0 microM in Govind, 14.0 microM in Jaya and 15.0 microM in Pusa Basmati-1. All the cultivars showed good proliferation on MS medium without hormone. In Govind, highest embryogenic response was observed in MS medium supplemented with 2, 4-D (0.4 microM) + kinetin (0.4 microM), while in Pusa Basmati-1 with 2, 4-D (0.4 microM) + kinetin (2.0 microM) and in Jaya on hormone-free MS medium. Excellent embryo regeneration in Govind was observed on MS medium supplemented with low concentrations (1.1 microM) of BAP or hormone-free MS medium, while in Pusa Basmati-1 and Jaya embryogenesis was observed on MS medium supplemented with higher concentration of BAP (2.2 microM). Similarly, maximum plantlets with proliferated roots were observed in Govind on hormone-free MS medium, while in Pusa Basmati-1 and Jaya on MS medium supplemented with high concentration of NAA (4.0 microM). Developed plantlets were further successfully acclimatized and grown under pot culture up to maturity. Further the yield potential of in vitro developed plants was accessed at par to the direct seeded one under pot culture. Present, protocol standardizes somatic embryogenesis and efficient regeneration of agronomically important, high yielding and diverse indica rice cultivars which can be utilized as an efficient tool for molecular studies and genetic transformation in future.
22147755	Identification of quantitative trait Loci for lipid metabolism in rice seeds.	2012	Mol Plant	Plant seed oil is important for human dietary consumption and industrial application. The oil trait is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), but no QTLs for fatty acid composition are known in rice, the monocot model plant. QTL analysis was performed using F(2) and F(2:3) progeny from a cross of an indica variety and a japonica variety. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed significant differences between parental lines in fatty acid composition of brown rice oil, and 29 associated QTLs in F(2) and/or F(2:3) populations were identified throughout the rice genome, except chromosomes 9 and 10. Eight QTLs were repeatedly identified in both populations across different environments. Five loci pleiotropically controlled different traits, contributing to complex interactions of oil with fatty acids and between fatty acids. Nine rice orthologs of Arabidopsis genes encoding key enzymes in lipid metabolism co-localized with 11 mapped QTLs. A strong QTL for oleic (18:1) and linoleic (18:2) acid were associated with a rice ortholog of a gene encoding acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), and another for palmitic acid (16:0) mapped similarly to the acyl-ACP thioesterase (FatB) gene ortholog. Our approach rapidly and efficiently identified candidate genes for mapped QTLs controlling fatty acid composition and oil concentration, providing information for improving rice grain quality by marker assisted selection.
22198727	Mapping QTLs for plant phenology and production traits using indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) lines adapted to rainfed environment.	2012	Mol Biotechnol	Drought is a major abiotic stress limiting rice production and yield stability in rainfed ecosystems. Identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for rice yield and yield components under water limited environments will help to develop drought resilient cultivars using marker assisted breeding (MAB) strategy. A total of 232 recombinant inbred lines of IR62266/Norungan were used to map QTLs for plant phenology and production traits under rainfed condition in target population of environments. A total of 79 QTLs for plant phenology and production traits with phenotypic variation ranging from 4.4 to 72.8% were detected under non-stress and drought stress conditions across two locations. Consistent QTLs for phenology and production traits were detected across experiments and water regimes. The QTL region, RM204-RM197-RM217 on chromosome 6 was linked to days to 50% flowering and grain yield per plant under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. The same genomic region, RM585-RM204-RM197 was also linked to harvest index under rainfed condition with positive alleles from Norungan, a local landrace. QTLs for plant production and drought resistance traits co-located near RM585-RM204-RM197-RM217 region on chromosome 6 in several rice genotypes. Thus with further fine mapping, this region may be useful as a candidate QTL for MAB, map-based cloning of genes and functional genomics studies for rainfed rice improvement.
22180466	Deciphering starch quality of rice kernels using metabolite profiling and pedigree network analysis.	2012	Mol Plant	The physiological properties of rice grains are immediately obvious to consumers. High-coverage metabolomic characterization of the rice diversity research set predicted a negative correlation between fatty acid and lipid levels and amylose/total starch ratio (amylose ratio), but the reason for this is unclear. To obtain new insight into the relationships among the visual phenotypes of rice kernels, starch granule structures, amylose ratios, and metabolite changes, we investigated the metabolite changes of five Japonica cultivars with various amylose ratios and two knockout mutants (e1, a Starch synthase IIIa (SSIIIa)-deficient mutant and the SSIIIa/starch branching enzyme (BE) double-knockout mutant 4019) by using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics techniques. Scanning electron microscopy clearly showed that the two mutants had unusual starch granule structures. The metabolomic compositions of two cultivars with high amylose ratios (Hoshiyutaka and Yumetoiro) exhibited similar patterns, while that of the double-knockout mutant, which has an extremely high amylose ratio, differed. Rice pedigree network analysis of the cultivars and the mutants provided insight into the association between metabolic-trait properties and their underlying genetic basis in rice breeding in Japan. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the Hoshiyutaka and Yumetoiro cultivars were Indica-like, yet they are classified as Japonica subpopulations. Exploring metabolomic traits is a powerful way to follow rice genetic traces and breeding history.
22157756	A nucleotide phosphatase activity in the nucleotide binding domain of an orphan resistance protein from rice.	2012	J Biol Chem	Plant resistance proteins (R-proteins) are key components of the plant immune system activated in response to a plethora of different pathogens. R-proteins are P-loop NTPase superfamily members, and current models describe their main function as ATPases in defense signaling pathways. Here we show that a subset of R-proteins have evolved a new function to combat pathogen infection. This subset of R-proteins possesses a nucleotide phosphatase activity in the nucleotide-binding domain. Related R-proteins that fall in the same phylogenetic clade all show the same nucleotide phosphatase activity indicating a conserved function within at least a subset of R-proteins. R-protein nucleotide phosphatases catalyze the production of nucleoside from nucleotide with the nucleotide monophosphate as the preferred substrate. Mutation of conserved catalytic residues substantially reduced activity consistent with the biochemistry of P-loop NTPases. Kinetic analysis, analytical gel filtration, and chemical cross-linking demonstrated that the nucleotide-binding domain was active as a multimer. Nuclear magnetic resonance and nucleotide analogues identified the terminal phosphate bond as the target of a reaction that utilized a metal-mediated nucleophilic attack by water on the phosphoester. In conclusion, we have identified a group of R-proteins with a unique function. This biochemical activity appears to have co-evolved with plants in signaling pathways designed to resist pathogen attack.
22212819	Hairpin RNA derived from the gene for Pns9, a viroplasm matrix protein of Rice gall dwarf virus, confers strong resistance to virus infection in transgenic rice plants.	2012	J Biotechnol	The nonstructural Pns9 protein of Rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) accumulates in viroplasm inclusions, which are structures that appear to play an important role in viral morphogenesis and are commonly found in host cells infected by viruses in the family Reoviridae. An RNA interference construct was designed to target the gene for Pns9 of RGDV, namely Trigger_G9. The resultant transgenic plants accumulated short interfering RNAs specific for the construct. All progenies from self-fertilized transgenic plants had strong and heritable resistance to RGDV infection and did not allow the propagation of RGDV. By contrast, our transgenic plants remained susceptible to Rice dwarf virus, another phytoreovirus. There were no significant changes in the morphology of our transgenic plants compared with non-inoculated wild-type rice plants, suggesting that genes critical for the growth of rice plants were unaffected. Our results demonstrate that the resistance to RGDV of our transgenic rice plants is not due to resistance to the vector insects but to specific inhibition of RGDV replication and that the designed trigger sequence is functioning normally. Thus, our strategy to target a gene for viroplasm matrix protein should be applicable to plant viruses that belong to the family Reoviridae.
22189496	Metaproteogenomic analysis of microbial communities in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of rice.	2012	ISME J	The above- and below-ground parts of rice plants create specific habitats for various microorganisms. In this study, we characterized the phyllosphere and rhizosphere microbiota of rice cultivars using a metaproteogenomic approach to get insight into the physiology of the bacteria and archaea that live in association with rice. The metaproteomic datasets gave rise to a total of about 4600 identified proteins and indicated the presence of one-carbon conversion processes in the rhizosphere as well as in the phyllosphere. Proteins involved in methanogenesis and methanotrophy were found in the rhizosphere, whereas methanol-based methylotrophy linked to the genus Methylobacterium dominated within the protein repertoire of the phyllosphere microbiota. Further, physiological traits of differential importance in phyllosphere versus rhizosphere bacteria included transport processes and stress responses, which were more conspicuous in the phyllosphere samples. In contrast, dinitrogenase reductase was exclusively identified in the rhizosphere, despite the presence of nifH genes also in diverse phyllosphere bacteria.
22351022	A one-time inducible transposon to create knockout mutants in rice.	2012	Methods Mol Biol	Use of a transposon is an efficient tagging tool for exploring the function of the gene it inserts into or is adjacent to. A few modifications have been applied to the native Ac transposon to allow it to transpose efficiently or spontaneously and stop quickly thereafter. Furthermore, locating the transposon between a constitutive plant promoter and a reporter gene, such as the firefly luciferase gene, allows for nondestructively detecting excision events in vivo. This chapter describes a detailed protocol for one-time inducible transposon tagging of rice cells and their subsequent screening and regeneration into mutant lines.
22389767	Assessment of extracts from red yeast rice for herb-drug interaction by in-vitro and in-vivo assays.	2012	Sci Rep	Red yeast rice (RYR) is made by fermenting the yeast Monascus purpureus over rice. It is a source of natural red food colorants, a food garnish and a traditional medication. Results of the current study demonstrated that polar fractions of the RYR preparations contained herbal-drug interaction activity, which if left unremoved, enhanced P-glycoprotein activity and inhibited the major drug metabolizing cytochromes P450, i,e, CYP 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4. The data from Caco-2 cell absorption and animal model studies further demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic modulation effect by RYR preparations containing the polar fractions ("untreated" preparation) was greater than that from RYR preparations with the polar fractions removed ("treated" preparation). The data indicates a potential for herb-drug interactions to be present in RYR commonly sold as nutritional supplements when the polar fractions are not removed and this should be taken into consideration when RYR is consumed with medications, including verapamil.
22348048	Large-scale identification of mirtrons in Arabidopsis and rice.	2012	PLoS One	A new catalog of microRNA (miRNA) species called mirtrons has been discovered in animals recently, which originate from spliced introns of the gene transcripts. However, only one putative mirtron, osa-MIR1429, has been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). We employed a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data- and structure-based approach to do a genome-wide search for the mirtron candidate in both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. Five and eighteen candidates were discovered in the two plants respectively. To investigate their biological roles, the targets of these mirtrons were predicted and validated based on degradome sequencing data. The result indicates that the mirtrons could guide target cleavages to exert their regulatory roles post-transcriptionally, which needs further experimental validation.
22313783	Identification of a degradation intermediate of the momilactone A rice phytoalexin by the rice blast fungus.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We have already shown that major rice diterpene phytoalexin, momilactone A, was detoxified by Magnaporthe oryzae. We report here the identification by NMR, MS, and chemical synthesis of 3,6-dioxo-19-nor-9β-pimara-7,15-diene (1) as the degradation intermediate. Compound 1 exhibited similar antifungal activity to that of momilactone A, indicating 1 to be a precursor of possible detoxified compounds.
22215681	Characterization of CYP76M5-8 indicates metabolic plasticity within a plant biosynthetic gene cluster.	2012	J Biol Chem	Recent reports have revealed genomic clustering of enzymatic genes for particular biosynthetic pathways in plant specialized/secondary metabolism. Rice (Oryza sativa) carries two such clusters for production of antimicrobial diterpenoid phytoalexins, with the cluster on chromosome 2 containing four closely related/homologous members of the cytochrome P450 CYP76M subfamily (CYP76M5-8). Notably, the underlying evolutionary expansion of these CYP appears to have occurred after assembly of the ancestral biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting separate roles. It has been demonstrated that CYP76M7 catalyzes C11α-hydroxylation of ent-cassadiene, and presumably mediates an early step in biosynthesis of the derived phytocassane class of phytoalexins. Here we report biochemical characterization of CYP76M5, -6, and -8. Our results indicate that CYP76M8 is a multifunctional/promiscuous hydroxylase, with CYP76M5 and -7 seeming to provide only redundant activity, while CYP76M6 seems to provide both redundant and novel activity, relative to CYP76M8. RNAi-mediated double knockdown of CYP76M7 and -8 suppresses elicitor inducible phytocassane production, indicating a role for these monooxygenases in phytocassane biosynthesis. In addition, our data suggests that CYP76M5, -6, and -8 may play redundant roles in production of the oryzalexin class of phytoalexins as well. Intriguingly, the preceding diterpene synthase for oryzalexin biosynthesis, unlike that for the phytocassanes, is not found in the chromosome 2 diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster. Accordingly, our results not only uncover a complex evolutionary history, but also further suggest some intriguing differences between plant biosynthetic gene clusters and the seemingly similar microbial operons. The implications for the underlying metabolic evolution of plants are then discussed.
22232242	Effects of hydrostatic high pressure on the structure and antibacterial activity of recombinant human lactoferrin from transgenic rice.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	High pressure was applied to recombinant human lactoferrin obtained from rice (rhLF) and its effect was evaluated on the structure and activity of the protein. Treatments of 400, 500, and 650 MPa for 15 min (20 °C), were applied to rhLF at 2 mg/mL in three iron-saturation forms. The structural characteristics of the treated proteins were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by fluorometric analysis, and immunoreactivity by ELISA. Iron retention and binding properties and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7 were also studied. The results obtained indicate that the treatments at 400 and 500 MPa did not greatly modifiy the conformation of lactoferrin, meanwhile treatment at 650 MPa affected in different degrees the three forms of rhLF. With respect to antibacterial activity, only apo rhLF showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, activity that was maintained after treatment at 400 MPa, while holo and AsIs rhLF did not inhibit the growth of E. coli.
22363522	Rice phospholipase A superfamily: organization, phylogenetic and expression analysis during abiotic stresses and development.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Phospholipase A (PLA) is an important group of enzymes responsible for phospholipid hydrolysis in lipid signaling. PLAs have been implicated in abiotic stress signaling and developmental events in various plants species. Genome-wide analysis of PLA superfamily has been carried out in dicot plant Arabidopsis. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis of PLAs has not been presented yet in crop plant rice.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis identified a total of 31 PLA encoding genes in the rice genome, which are divided into three classes; phospholipase A(1) (PLA(1)), patatin like phospholipases (pPLA) and low molecular weight secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) based on their sequences and phylogeny. A subset of 10 rice PLAs exhibited chromosomal duplication, emphasizing the role of duplication in the expansion of this gene family in rice. Microarray expression profiling revealed a number of PLA members expressing differentially and significantly under abiotic stresses and reproductive development. Comparative expression analysis with Arabidopsis PLAs revealed a high degree of functional conservation between the orthologs in two plant species, which also indicated the vital role of PLAs in stress signaling and plant development across different plant species. Moreover, sub-cellular localization of a few candidates suggests their differential localization and functional role in the lipid signaling.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The comprehensive analysis and expression profiling would provide a critical platform for the functional characterization of the candidate PLA genes in crop plants.
22347394	Transcriptomic analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) developing embryos using the RNA-Seq technique.	2012	PLoS One	Rice (Oryza sativa) is an excellent model monocot with a known genome sequence for studying embryogenesis. Here we report the transcriptome profiling analysis of rice developing embryos using RNA-Seq as an attempt to gain insight into the molecular and cellular events associated with rice embryogenesis. RNA-Seq analysis generated 17,755,890 sequence reads aligned with 27,190 genes, which provided abundant data for the analysis of rice embryogenesis. A total of 23,971, 23,732, and 23,592 genes were identified from embryos at three developmental stages (3-5, 7, and 14 DAP), while an analysis between stages allowed the identification of a subset of stage-specific genes. The number of genes expressed stage-specifically was 1,131, 1,443, and 1,223, respectively. In addition, we investigated transcriptomic changes during rice embryogenesis based on our RNA-Seq data. A total of 1,011 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log(2)Ratio ≥ 1, FDR ≤ 0.001) were identified; thus, the transcriptome of the developing rice embryos changed considerably. A total of 672 genes with significant changes in expression were detected between 3-5 and 7 DAP; 504 DEGs were identified between 7 and 14 DAP. A large number of genes related to metabolism, transcriptional regulation, nucleic acid replication/processing, and signal transduction were expressed predominantly in the early and middle stages of embryogenesis. Protein biosynthesis-related genes accumulated predominantly in embryos at the middle stage. Genes for starch/sucrose metabolism and protein modification were highly expressed in the middle and late stages of embryogenesis. In addition, we found that many transcription factor families may play important roles at different developmental stages, not only in embryo initiation but also in other developmental processes. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in rice embryogenesis and provide a foundation for future studies on embryo development in rice and other cereal crops.
22293194	Functional analysis of the rice rubisco activase promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	To gain a better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the rice rubisco activase (Rca) gene, variants of the Rca gene promoter (one full-length and four deletion mutants) fused to the coding region of the bacterial reporter gene β-glucuronidase (GUS) were introduced into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Our results show that a 340 bp fragment spanning from -297 to +43 bp relative to the transcription initiation site is enough to promote tissue-specific and light-inducible expression of the rice Rca gene as done by the full-length promoter (-1428 to +43 bp). Further deletion analysis indicated that the region conferring tissue-specificity of Rca expression is localized within a 105 bp fragment from -58 to +43 bp, while light-inducible expression of Rca is mediated by the region from -297 to -58 bp. Gel shift assays and competition experiments demonstrated that rice nuclear proteins bind specifically with the fragment conferring light responsiveness at more than one binding site. This implies that multiple cis-elements may be involved in light-induced expression of the rice Rca gene. These works provide a useful reference for understanding transcriptional regulation mechanism of the rice Rca gene, and lay a strong foundation for further detection of related cis-elements and trans-factors.
22229385	Dissection of genotype-phenotype associations in rice grains using metabolome quantitative trait loci analysis.	2012	Plant J	A comprehensive and large-scale metabolome quantitative trait loci (mQTL) analysis was performed to investigate the genetic backgrounds associated with metabolic phenotypes in rice grains. The metabolome dataset consisted of 759 metabolite signals obtained from the grains of 85 lines of rice (Oryza sativa, Sasanishiki × Habataki back-crossed inbred lines). Metabolome analysis was performed using four mass spectrometry pipelines to enhance detection of different classes of metabolites. This mQTL analysis of a wide range of metabolites highlighted an uneven distribution of 802 mQTLs on the rice genome, as well as different modes of metabolic trait (m-trait) control among various types of metabolites. The levels of most metabolites within rice grains were highly sensitive to environmental factors, but only weakly associated with mQTLs. Coordinated control was observed for several groups of metabolites, such as amino acids linked to the mQTL hotspot on chromosome 3. For flavonoids, m-trait variation among the experimental lines was tightly governed by genetic factors that alter the glycosylation of flavones. Many loci affecting levels of metabolites were detected by QTL analysis, and plausible gene candidates were evaluated by in silico analysis. Several mQTLs profoundly influenced metabolite levels, providing insight into the control of rice metabolism. The genomic region and genes potentially responsible for the biosynthesis of apigenin-6,8-di-C-α-l-arabinoside are presented as an example of a critical mQTL identified by the analysis.
22267009	Genome sequencing reveals agronomically important loci in rice using MutMap.	2012	Nat Biotechnol	The majority of agronomic traits are controlled by multiple genes that cause minor phenotypic effects, making the identification of these genes difficult. Here we introduce MutMap, a method based on whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA from a segregating population of plants that show a useful phenotype. In MutMap, a mutant is crossed directly to the original wild-type line and then selfed, allowing unequivocal segregation in second filial generation (F(2)) progeny of subtle phenotypic differences. This approach is particularly amenable to crop species because it minimizes the number of genetic crosses (n = 1 or 0) and mutant F(2) progeny that are required. We applied MutMap to seven mutants of a Japanese elite rice cultivar and identified the unique genomic positions most probable to harbor mutations causing pale green leaves and semidwarfism, an agronomically relevant trait. These results show that MutMap can accelerate the genetic improvement of rice and other crop plants.
22427867	Allelic analysis of sheath blight resistance with association mapping in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Sheath blight (ShB) caused by the soil-borne pathogen Rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastating diseases in rice world-wide. Global attention has focused on examining individual mapping populations for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ShB resistance, but to date no study has taken advantage of association mapping to examine hundreds of lines for potentially novel QTLs. Our objective was to identify ShB QTLs via association mapping in rice using 217 sub-core entries from the USDA rice core collection, which were phenotyped with a micro-chamber screening method and genotyped with 155 genome-wide markers. Structure analysis divided the mapping panel into five groups, and model comparison revealed that PCA5 with genomic control was the best model for association mapping of ShB. Ten marker loci on seven chromosomes were significantly associated with response to the ShB pathogen. Among multiple alleles in each identified loci, the allele contributing the greatest effect to ShB resistance was named the putative resistant allele. Among 217 entries, entry GSOR 310389 contained the most putative resistant alleles, eight out of ten. The number of putative resistant alleles presented in an entry was highly and significantly correlated with the decrease of ShB rating (r = -0.535) or the increase of ShB resistance. Majority of the resistant entries that contained a large number of the putative resistant alleles belonged to indica, which is consistent with a general observation that most ShB resistant accessions are of indica origin. These findings demonstrate the potential to improve breeding efficiency by using marker-assisted selection to pyramid putative resistant alleles from various loci in a cultivar for enhanced ShB resistance in rice.
22383984	Identification of genome-wide variations among three elite restorer lines for hybrid-rice.	2012	PLoS One	Rice restorer lines play an important role in three-line hybrid rice production. Previous research based on molecular tagging has suggested that the restorer lines used widely today have narrow genetic backgrounds. However, patterns of genetic variation at a genome-wide scale in these restorer lines remain largely unknown. The present study performed re-sequencing and genome-wide variation analysis of three important representative restorer lines, namely, IR24, MH63, and SH527, using the Solexa sequencing technology. With the genomic sequence of the Indica cultivar 9311 as the reference, the following genetic features were identified: 267,383 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 52,847 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDels), and 3,286 structural variations (SVs) in the genome of IR24; 288,764 SNPs, 59,658 InDels, and 3,226 SVs in MH63; and 259,862 SNPs, 55,500 InDels, and 3,127 SVs in SH527. Variations between samples were also determined by comparative analysis of authentic collections of SNPs, InDels, and SVs, and were functionally annotated. Furthermore, variations in several important genes were also surveyed by alignment analysis in these lines. Our results suggest that genetic variations among these lines, although far lower than those reported in the landrace population, are greater than expected, indicating a complicated genetic basis for the phenotypic diversity of the restorer lines. Identification of genome-wide variation and pattern analysis among the restorer lines will facilitate future genetic studies and the molecular improvement of hybrid rice.
22367872	Ac-Ds solutions for rice insertion mutagenesis.	2012	Methods Mol Biol	Rice is the model plant for monocotyledons. Since the completion of the high-quality sequence of its genome, the international community is deploying efforts to identify the function of the 30-40,000 nontransposable element genes of rice. These efforts comprise the creation of large collections of rice mutants accessible to the international scientific community. In addition to loss of function mutants, insertion mutagenesis using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and engineered mobile elements allows the identification of genes through enhancer or gene trapping or activation tagging. The maize transposable element Ac-Ds is known to be active in rice since the early 1990s and it does not interfere with endogenous rice transposons. This is the guaranty that induced mutation obtained with the mobility of the Ds element will be stable when the source of Ac transposase is removed from the mutated genome. In this paper, we describe single- or double-component T-DNA constructs that have been used to introduce a functional Ac-Ds system in rice and allowed the generation and selection of different type of Ds insertion mutations in the rice genome.
22232252	Genetic organization of the hrp gene cluster in Acidovorax avenae strain N1141 and a novel effector protein that elicits immune responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The immune system of plants consists of two main arms, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The multiple effectors that trigger ETI are translocated into plant cells by the type III secretion system (T3SS) of pathogenic bacteria. The rice-avirulent N1141 strain of Acidovorax avenae causes ETI in rice, including hypersensitive response (HR) cell death. Sequence analysis indicated that the N1141 genome contains the hrp gene cluster (35.3 kb), including genes encoding the T3SS apparatus. The T3SS-defective N1141 mutant (NΔT3SS) did not cause HR cell death, suggesting that ETI is caused by translocation of effector proteins into rice cells via T3SS. Computational sequence analysis predicted that Lrp, HrpW, and HrpY are secreted by T3SS. The hrpY deletion mutant (NΔhrpY) did not cause ETI, suggesting that HrpY is an important effector of ETI in the interaction between A. avenae N1141 and rice.
22291881	QTL mapping of combining ability and heterosis of agronomic traits in rice backcross recombinant inbred lines and hybrid crosses.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Combining ability effects are very effective genetic parameters in deciding the next phase of breeding programs. Although some breeding strategies on the basis of evaluating combining ability have been utilized extensively in hybrid breeding, little is known about the genetic basis of combining ability. Combining ability is a complex trait that is controlled by polygenes. With the advent and development of molecular markers, it is feasible to evaluate the genetic bases of combining ability and heterosis of elite rice hybrids through QTL analysis.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we first developed a QTL-mapping method for dissecting combining ability and heterosis of agronomic traits. With three testcross populations and a BCRIL population in rice, biometric and QTL analyses were conducted for ten agronomic traits. The significance of general combining ability and special combining ability for most of the traits indicated the importance of both additive and non-additive effects on expression levels. A large number of additive effect QTLs associated with performance per se of BCRIL and general combining ability, and dominant effect QTLs associated with special combining ability and heterosis were identified for the ten traits.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combining ability of agronomic traits could be analyzed by the QTL mapping method. The characteristics revealed by the QTLs for combining ability of agronomic traits were similar with those by multitudinous QTLs for agronomic traits with performance per se of BCRIL. Several QTLs (1-6 in this study) were identified for each trait for combining ability. It demonstrated that some of the QTLs were pleiotropic or linked tightly with each other. The identification of QTLs responsible for combining ability and heterosis in the present study provides valuable information for dissecting genetic basis of combining ability.
22235904	Flagella mediate endophytic competence rather than act as MAMPS in rice-Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 interactions.	2012	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 is an endophytic betaproteobacterium able to colonize rice roots without induction of visible disease symptoms. BH72 possesses one polar flagellum. The genome harbors three copies of putative fliC genes, generally encoding the major structural protein flagellin. It is not clear whether, in endophytic interactions, flagella mediate endophytic competence or act as MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) inducing plant defense responses. Therefore, possible functions of the three FliC proteins were investigated. Only fliC3 was found to be highly expressed in pure culture and in association with rice roots and to be required for bacterial motility, suggesting that it encodes the major flagellin. Endophytic colonization of rice roots was significantly reduced in the in-frame deletion mutant, while the establishment of microcolonies on the root surface was not affected. Moreover, an elicitation of defense responses related to FliC3 was not observed. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that FliC3 does not play a major role as a MAMP but is required for endophytic colonization in the Azoarcus-rice interaction, most likely for spreading inside the plant.
22297847	Serotonin accumulation in transgenic rice by over-expressing tryptophan decarboxylase results in a dark brown phenotype and stunted growth.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	A mutant M47286 with a stunted growth, low fertility and dark-brown phenotype was identified from a T-DNA-tagged rice mutant library. This mutant contained a copy of the T-DNA tag inserted at the location where the expression of two putative tryptophan decarboxylase genes, TDC-1 and TDC-3, were activated. Enzymatic assays of both recombinant proteins showed tryptophan decarboxylase activities that converted tryptophan to tryptamine, which could be converted to serotonin by a constitutively expressed tryptamine 5' hydroxylase (T5H) in rice plants. Over-expression of TDC-1 and TDC-3 in transgenic rice recapitulated the stunted growth, darkbrown phenotype and resulted in a low fertility similar to M47286. The degree of stunted growth and dark-brown color was proportional to the expression levels of TDC-1 and TDC-3. The levels of tryptamine and serotonin accumulation in these transgenic rice lines were also directly correlated with the expression levels of TDC-1 and TDC-3. A mass spectrometry assay demonstrated that the darkbrown leaves and hulls in the TDC-overexpressing transgenic rice were caused by the accumulation of serotonin dimer and that the stunted growth and low fertility were also caused by the accumulation of serotonin and serotonin dimer, but not tryptamine. These results represent the first evidence that over-expression of TDC results in stunted growth, low fertility and the accumulation of serotonin, which when converted to serotonin dimer, leads to a dark brown plant color.
22332867	Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for heat denaturation of human recombinant lactoferrin from rice.	2012	Biochem Cell Biol	Heat denaturation of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLf) from rice with 3 different iron-saturation degrees, holo rhLf (iron-saturated), AsIs rhLf (60% iron saturation), and apo rhLf (iron-depleted), was studied. The 3 forms of rhLf were subjected to heat treatment, and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the denaturation process were determined. Thermal denaturation of rhLf was assessed by measuring the loss of reactivity against specific antibodies. D(t) values (time to reduce 90% of immunoreactivity) decreased with increasing temperature of treatment for apo and holo rhLf, those values being higher for the iron-saturated form, which indicates that iron confers thermal stability to rhLf. However, AsIs rhLf showed a different behaviour with an increase in resistance to heat between 79 °C and 84 °C, so that the kinetic parameters could not be calculated. The heat denaturation process for apo and holo rhLf was best described assuming a reaction order of 1.5. The activation energy of the denaturation process was 648.20 kJ/mol for holo rhLf and 406.94 kJ/mol for apo rhLf, confirming that iron-depleted rhLf is more sensitive to heat treatment than iron-saturated rhLf.
22329407	Rolling-leaf14 is a 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase family protein that modulates rice leaf rolling by affecting secondary cell wall formation in leaves.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	As an important agronomic trait, leaf rolling in rice (Oryza sativa L.) has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders. Moderate leaf rolling increases the amount of photosynthesis in cultivars and hence raises grain yield. Here, we describe the map-based cloning of the gene RL14, which was found to encode a 2OG-Fe (II) oxygenase of unknown function. rl14 mutant plants had incurved leaves because of the shrinkage of bulliform cells on the adaxial side. In addition, rl14 mutant plants displayed smaller stomatal complexes and decreased transpiration rates, as compared with the wild type. Defective development could be rescued functionally by the expression of wild-type RL14. RL14 was transcribed in sclerenchymatous cells in leaves that remained wrapped inside the sheath. In mature leaves, RL14 accumulated mainly in the mesophyll cells that surround the vasculature. Expression of genes related to secondary cell wall formation was affected in rl14-1 mutants, and cellulose and lignin content were altered in rl14-1 leaves. These results reveal that the RL14 gene affects water transport in leaves by affecting the composition of the secondary cell wall. This change in water transport results in water deficiency, which is the major reason for the abnormal shape of the bulliform cells.
22383627	Proteomic analysis of embryonic proteins synthesized from long-lived mRNAs during germination of rice seeds.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Dry seeds contain translatable, long-lived mRNAs that are stored during seed maturation. Early studies using transcriptional inhibitors supported the view that protein synthesis during the initial phase of germination occurs on long-lived mRNA templates. Rice seeds were treated with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Act D), and the embryonic proteins translated from long-lived mRNAs during germination were identified using a proteomic analysis. De novo transcription was not required for germination of rice seeds, since >80% of seeds germinated when transcription was prevented by treatment with Act D. In contrast, germination was completely inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation. Thus, de novo protein synthesis is necessary for germination of rice seeds. The proteomic analysis revealed that 20 proteins are up-regulated during germination, even after Act D treatment. Many of the up-regulated proteins are involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cytoskeleton formation. These results indicate that some of the germination-specific proteins involved in energy production and maintenance of cell structure in rice seeds are synthesized from long-lived mRNAs. The timing of translation of eight up-regulated proteins was clearly later than that of the other up-regulated proteins under conditions in which transcription was inhibited by Act D, suggesting that translation of long-lived mRNAs in rice seeds is regulated according to the germination phase.
22382064	[Characteristics and molecular mapping of a novel chlorophyll-deficient yellow-leaf mutant in rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	A yellow-leaf mutant (yl11) with chlorophyll-deficient in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was selected from the progeny of a japonica rice variety "Jiahua 1" treated with 60Co γ-radiation. In comparison with the wild-type parent, "Jiahua 1", the mutant had yellow-leaves at whole growth stages and displayed significantly decreased in chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate. Underdeveloped chloroplast and alterations of the major agronomic traits, such as plant-heights, were also observed in the mutant. Genetic analysis confirmed that the yellow-leaf mutant trait was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene (yl11). Using SSR and In/Del molecular markers and 920 F2 and F3 plants from the cross of yl11 with the indica variety Peiai 64S, the yl11 was mapped between the molecular markers MM2199 and InDel21039 with a physical distance of 110 kb on the long arm of chromosome 11, in which no known functional genes for chlorophyll synthesis or chloroplast development in rice has been found. These findings will provide a foundation for the cloning and functional analysis of this gene in the future.
22353560	A mutation of OSOTP 51 leads to impairment of photosystem I complex assembly and serious photo-damage in rice.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	Gene expression in chloroplasts is regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica) mutant osotp51 with significant reduction in photosystem I (PSI). The osotp51 is extremely sensitive to light and accumulates a higher level of reactive oxygen species. Its leaves are almost albino when grown at 40 μmol photons/m(2) per s. However, grown at 4 μmol photons/m(2) per s, osotp51 has a similar phenotype to the wild-type. 77K chlorophyll fluorescence analysis showed a blue shift in the highest peak emission from PSI in osotp51. In addition, the level of PSI and PSII dimer is dramatically reduced in osotp51. OSOTP 51 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeats protein, homologous to organelle transcript processing 51 in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function OSOTP51 affects intron splicing of a number of plastid genes, particularly the ycf3 coding a protein involved in the assembly of PSI complex. OSOTP51 is functionally conserved in higher plants. The mutation of osotp51 indirectly leads to a widespread change in the structure and functions of PSI, results in severe photoinhibition, and finally dies, even when grown under very low light intensity.
22350178	Dynamic analysis of QTLs on tiller number in rice (Oryza sativa L.) with single segment substitution lines.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Twelve single segment substitution lines (SSSLs) in rice, which contain quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for tiller number detected previously, were used to study dynamic expression of the QTLs in this study. These SSSLs and their recipient, Hua-Jing-Xian 74 (HJX74), were used to produce 78 crossing combinations first, and then these combinations and their parents were grown in two planting seasons with three cropping densities. Tiller number was measured at seven developmental stages. QTL effects including main effects (additive, dominance and epistasis), QTL × season and QTL × density interaction effects were analyzed at each measured stage. The additive, dominant and epistatic effects of the 12 QTLs as well as their interaction effects with the seasons and with the densities all display dynamic changes with the development. Eight QTLs are detected with significant additive effects and/or additive × season and/or additive × density interaction effects at least at one developmental stage, and all QTLs have significant dominant and epistatic effects and/or interaction effects involved in. For most of the QTLs dominant effects are much bigger than additive effects, showing overdominance. Each QTL interacts at least with eight other QTLs. Additive and dominant effects of these QTLs are mostly positive while epistatic effects are negative and minor. Most of the QTLs show significant interactions with planting seasons and cropping densities, but the additive effects of QTLs Tn3-1 and Tn3-2, the dominant effects of QTL Tn7 and Tn8, and the epistatic effects of 14 pairs of QTLs are stable across seasons and the dominant effect of QTL Tn3-3 and the epistatic effects of QTL pairs Tn2-1/Tn6-2, Tn2-1/Tn9 and Tn3-3/Tn6-3 are nearly consistent across cropping densities. This paper is the first report of dynamics on dominances and epistasis of QTLs for tiller number in rice and provides abundant information, which is useful to improve rice tiller number via heterosis and/or QTL pyramiding.
22217248	A systems approach for identifying resistance factors to Rice stripe virus.	2012	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes disease that can severely affect the productivity of rice (Oryza sativa). Several RSV-resistant cultivars have been developed. However, host factors conferring RSV resistance in these cultivars are still elusive. Here, we present a systems approach for identifying potential rice resistance factors. We developed two near-isogenic lines (NIL), RSV-resistant NIL22 and RSV-susceptible NIL37, and performed gene expression profiling of the two lines in RSV-infected and RSV-uninfected conditions. We identified 237 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between NIL22 and NIL37. By integrating with known quantitative trait loci (QTL), we selected 11 DEG located within the RSV resistance QTL as RSV resistance factor candidates. Furthermore, we identified 417 DEG between RSV-infected and RSV-uninfected conditions. Using an interaction network-based method, we selected 20 DEG highly interacting with the two sets of DEG as RSV resistance factor candidates. Among the 31 candidates, we selected the final set of 21 potential RSV resistance factors whose differential expression was confirmed in the independent samples using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Finally, we reconstructed a network model delineating potential association of the 21 selected factors with resistance-related processes. In summary, our approach, based on gene expression profiling, revealed potential host resistance factors and a network model describing their relationships with resistance-related processes, which can be further validated in detailed experiments.
22403009	Genetic variation and association mapping of silica concentration in rice hulls using a germplasm collection.	2011	Genetica	An association analysis on the genetic variability for silica concentration in rice hulls was performed using a "Mini-Core" set of 174 accessions representative of the germplasm diversity found in the USDA world collection of rice. Hull silica concentration was determined in replicated trials conducted in two southern states in the USA and was analyzed for its association with 164 genome-wide DNA markers. Among the accessions, the average silica concentration ranged from 120 to 251 mg g(-1). Ample variation was seen within each of the five sub-populations of rice, as well as the 14 geographic regions that the accessions originated from. There was also an effect due to location and accession × location (G × E) interaction demonstrating the importance of assessing silica concentration across multiple environments. Twelve markers on ten chromosomes were significantly associated with hull silica concentration. Six markers (RM5644, RM5371, RM1335, RM283, RM263, and RM178) corroborated quantitative trait locus for silica concentration identified in other mapping studies. Our results provide germplasm and genetic markers that will assist breeding efforts to develop cultivars that have either high or low hull silica concentration. High silica hulls are good raw material for silica based industrial compounds, while low silica hulls are more biodegradable.
22325874	Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of microsomal fractions of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa subjected to high salinity.	2012	Plant Sci	Plants respond to salt stress by initiating phosphorylation cascades in their cells. Many key phosphorylation events take place at membranes. Microsomal fractions from 400 mM salt-treated Arabidopsis suspension plants were isolated, followed by trypsin shaving, enrichment using Zirconium ion-charged or TiO(2) magnetic beads, and tandem mass spectrometry analyses for site mapping. A total of 27 phosphorylation sites from 20 Arabidopsis proteins including photosystem II reaction center protein H PsbH were identified. In addition to Arabidopsis, microsomal fractions from shoots of 200 mM salt-treated rice was carried out, followed by trypsin digestion using shaving or tube-gel, and enrichment using Zirconium ion-charged or TiO(2) magnetic beads. This yielded identification of 13 phosphorylation sites from 8 proteins including photosystem II reaction center protein H PsbH. Label-free quantitative analysis suggests that the phosphorylation sites of PsbH were regulated by salt stress in Arabidopsis and rice. Sequence alignment of PsbH phosphorylation sites indicates that Thr-2 and Thr-4 are evolutionarily conserved in plants. Four conserved phosphorylation motifs were predicted, and these suggest that a specific unknown kinase or phosphatase is involved in high-salt stress responses in plants.
22738867	Expression of defense genes and antioxidant defense responses in rice resistance to neck blast at the preliminary heading stage and full heading stage.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	The rice variety Xiushui227 is resistant to neck blast at three crucial panicle stages (the booting stage, the preliminary heading stage (PHS), and the full heading stage (FHS)) that controlling neck blast. The other rice variety Liangyou6326 is susceptible to neck blast at these three panicle stages. These two varieties were used to analyze the expression patterns of defense genes and antioxidant defense responses at the PHS and FHS, after inoculating the necks in vitro with Magnaporthe oryzae, respectively. All defense genes (pathogenesis-related genes PR1a, Gns1 (1,3; 1,4-β-glucanase), Cht-1 (chitinase), PR4, PR5, and PR10a, secondary metabolite pathway genes PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), CHS (chalcone synthase), and LOX (lipoxygenase), and oxidative stress-related protein genes POX22.3 (peroxidase), and PPO (polyphenol oxidase)) used in this experiment except Cht-1, CHS and PPO could mainly play important roles in the resistance to neck blast at the PHS in Xiushui227, and CHS and PPO may primarily participate in fighting back against to neck blast at the FHS. Conversely, PR1a, Cht-1, PR4, PR10a, CHS, LOX-RLL, and PPO could chiefly play participate in defending Liangyou6326 against neck blast at the FHS, and PR5, PAL, and POX22.3 may be primarily involved in fighting back against to neck blast at the PHS. Furthermore, the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase may mainly participate in defending Xiushui227 against neck blast at the PHS and defending Liangyou6326 against neck blast at the FHS, respectively. Therefore oxidative damage is less at the PHS in Xiushui227 and at the FHS in Liangyou6326, respectively.
22530609	HKT2;2/1, a K⁺-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism.	2012	Plant J	We have investigated OsHKT2;1 natural variation in a collection of 49 cultivars with different levels of salt tolerance and geographical origins. The effect of identified polymorphism on OsHKT2;1 activity was analysed through heterologous expression of variants in Xenopus oocytes. OsHKT2;1 appeared to be a highly conserved protein with only five possible amino acid substitutions that have no substantial effect on functional properties. Our study, however, also identified a new HKT isoform, No-OsHKT2;2/1 in Nona Bokra, a highly salt-tolerant cultivar. No-OsHKT2;2/1 probably originated from a deletion in chromosome 6, producing a chimeric gene. Its 5' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;2, whose full-length sequence is not present in Nipponbare but has been identified in Pokkali, a salt-tolerant rice cultivar. Its 3' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;1. No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na⁺ concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1. Expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, No-OsHKT2;2/1 exhibited a strong permeability to Na⁺ and K⁺, even at high external Na⁺ concentrations, like OsHKT2;2, and in contrast to OsHKT2;1. Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K⁺ uptake under saline conditions.
22698746	[Isolation of the promoter region of HAK gene from Aeluropus littoralis and functional analysis in rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	The AlHAK1 gene encoding a high-affinity K+ transporter was isolated from Aeluropus littoralis (Gouan) Parl, a graminaceous halophyte, and plays a crucial role in nutrition and ion homeostasis in plant cell. To investigate the regulation role of AlHAK1 on the transcriptional level, an about 1.3 kb 5'-flanking region of the AlHAK1 gene containing a putative promoter was cloned by genome walking method. Cis-regulatory elements analysis showed AlHAK1-promoter region contained typical TATA and CAAT boxes, and some growth and development relative motifs, as well as environmental re-sponsive elements. To reveal the function and regulating role, the AlHAK1 promoter was fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in the pCAMBIA1301 vector and introduced into rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Histo-chemical staining indicated that the GUS expression directed by AlHAK1 promoter was observed in leaves, stems, roots, anther, lemma, and palea. GUS quantitative fluorometric analysis indicated that GUS activity directed by AlHAK1 promoter was lower than CaMV35S and Ubiquitin constitutive promoters; however, in the roots and stems the GUS activity was rela-tively high and displayed a tissue-specific expression pattern. Under ABA, high temperature or drought stress, the GUS activity directed by AlHAK1 promoter was inducible in the roots and stems, suggesting the elements of HSE (-682 bp) and MybBS (-1 268 bp) might play a role in the inducible regulation.
22607456	Identification of positive and negative regulators of disease resistance to rice blast fungus using constitutive gene expression patterns.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Elevated constitutive expression of components of the defence arsenal is associated with quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, a phenomenon called preformed defence. While the role of many disease regulators in inducible defence systems has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid so far to genes that regulate preformed defence. In this study, we show by microarray analysis across rice diversity that the preformed defence phenomenon impacts on a large number of defence-related genes without apparently affecting other biological processes. Using a guilt-by-association strategy, we identified two positive regulators that promote constitutive expression of known defence markers and partial resistance to rice blast. The HSF23 gene encodes for a putative member of the heat shock transcription factor family, while CaMBP encodes for a putative Calmodulin-binding protein. Both HSF23 and CaMBP strongly affect preformed defence and also plant growth. Additionally, we identified the OB-fold gene as a negative regulator of blast resistance, which could be involved in RNA stabilization. The OB-fold mutants do not suffer from obvious developmental defects. Taken together, our results prove that our strategy of combining analysis of gene expression diversity with guilt-by-association is a powerful way to identify disease resistance regulators in rice.
22662107	Identification of gene modules associated with drought response in rice by network-based analysis.	2012	PLoS One	Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie plant responses to drought stress is challenging due to the complex interplay of numerous different genes. Here, we used network-based gene clustering to uncover the relationships between drought-responsive genes from large microarray datasets. We identified 2,607 rice genes that showed significant changes in gene expression under drought stress; 1,392 genes were highly intercorrelated to form 15 gene modules. These drought-responsive gene modules are biologically plausible, with enrichments for genes in common functional categories, stress response changes, tissue-specific expression and transcription factor binding sites. We observed that a gene module (referred to as module 4) consisting of 134 genes was significantly associated with drought response in both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice varieties. This module is enriched for genes involved in controlling the response of the plant to water and embryonic development, including a heat shock transcription factor as the key regulator in the expression of ABRE-containing genes. These results suggest that module 4 is highly conserved in the ABA-mediated drought response pathway in different rice varieties. Moreover, our study showed that many hub genes clustered in rice chromosomes had significant associations with QTLs for drought stress tolerance. The relationship between hub gene clusters and drought tolerance QTLs may provide a key to understand the genetic basis of drought tolerance in rice.
22649533	Recent and projected increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration can enhance gene flow between wild and genetically altered rice (Oryza sativa).	2012	PLoS One	Although recent and projected increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide can alter plant phenological development, these changes have not been quantified in terms of floral outcrossing rates or gene transfer. Could differential phenological development in response to rising CO(2) between genetically modified crops and wild, weedy relatives increase the spread of novel genes, potentially altering evolutionary fitness? Here we show that increasing CO(2) from an early 20(th) century concentration (300 µmol mol(-1)) to current (400 µmol mol(-1)) and projected, mid-21(st) century (600 µmol mol(-1)) values, enhanced the flow of genes from wild, weedy rice to the genetically altered, herbicide resistant, cultivated population, with outcrossing increasing from 0.22% to 0.71% from 300 to 600 µmol mol(-1). The increase in outcrossing and gene transfer was associated with differential increases in plant height, as well as greater tiller and panicle production in the wild, relative to the cultivated population. In addition, increasing CO(2) also resulted in a greater synchronicity in flowering times between the two populations. The observed changes reported here resulted in a subsequent increase in rice dedomestication and a greater number of weedy, herbicide-resistant hybrid progeny. Overall, these data suggest that differential phenological responses to rising atmospheric CO(2) could result in enhanced flow of novel genes and greater success of feral plant species in agroecosystems.
22698753	Heat exposure alters the expression of SOD, POD, APX and CAT isozymes and mitigates low cadmium toxicity in seedlings of sensitive and tolerant rice cultivars.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	A 0-500 μM Cd(2+) alone and/or heat stress in rice cv. DR-92 (sensitive) and cv. Bh-1 (tolerant), altered the banding patterns of SOD, CAT, POD and APX enzymes in roots/shoots. In controls, six/seven activity bands for POD in roots/shoots were observed. The band intensities of some decreased under combination of Cd(2+) + heat stress. Six SOD isoforms in shoots of cv. Bh-1 and three in cv. DR-92 appeared. In sensitive cv. DR-92 a trinuclear Cu/Zn/Mn-SOD 1 isozyme was upregulated in shoots under Cd/HS/Cd + HS treatments whereas a suppression in the same was noticed in roots. Under Cd alone the Cu/Zn/Mn-SOD 2 was strongly induced in roots which was otherwise absent in all HS treatments. POD R7 band was absent in HS alone but was induced under Cd(2+) + HS treatments in rice cv. DR-92. In tolerant cv. Bh-1, isozyme Mn-SOD 3 was induced under Cd alone but was absent under HS. Cu/Zn/Mn-SOD 2 and Cu/Zn/Mn-SOD 3 were strongly induced in roots and shoots under low or moderate Cd(2+) + HS treatments. APX R4/CATR2 isozymes which were absent under Cd(2+) alone or HS alone were induced under combination of Cd(2+) + HS indicating de novo synthesis of enzyme proteins under combined stressors. Decreased band intensities under Cd(2+) + HS suggest a cross-talk between response pathways of Cd(2+) and heat stress in rice. Results suggest Cd(2+) specific, heat-specific, tissue specific and differential expression of SOD/POD/APX/CAT and that Mn-SOD 3/APXR4/CATR2 seem to form important components of antioxidant defense in rice roots under combination of Cd(2+) + HS which helps to mitigate the effect of low Cd(2+) toxicity in tolerant rice cv. Bh-1.
22754356	Simple and rapid molecular techniques for identification of amylose levels in rice varieties.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	The polymorphisms of Waxy (Wx) microsatellite and G-T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Wx gene region were analyzed using simplified techniques in fifteen rice varieties. A rapid and reliable electrophoresis method, MetaPhor agarose gel electrophoresis (MAGE), was effectively employed as an alternative to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for separating Wx microsatellite alleles. The amplified products containing the Wx microsatellite ranged from 100 to 130 bp in length. Five Wx microsatellite alleles, namely (CT)(10), (CT)(11), (CT)(16), (CT)(17), and (CT)(18) were identified. Of these, (CT)(11) and (CT)(17) were the predominant classes among the tested varieties. All varieties with an apparent amylose content higher than 24% were associated with the shorter repeat alleles; (CT)(10) and (CT)(11), while varieties with 24% or less amylose were associated with the longer repeat alleles. All varieties with intermediate and high amylose content had the sequence AGGTATA at the 5'-leader intron splice site, while varieties with low amylose content had the sequence AGTTATA. The G-T polymorphism was further verified by the PCR-AccI cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) method, in which only genotypes containing the AGGTATA sequence were cleaved by AccI. Hence, varieties with desirable amylose levels can be developed rapidly using the Wx microsatellite and G-T SNP, along with MAGE.
22566008	Antidiabetic effects of a standardized Egyptian rice bran extract.	2013	Phytother Res	An extract was prepared from Egyptian stabilized rice bran and standardized to contain 2% γ-oryzanol in addition to its content of other bioactives, notably tocotrienol and policosanol. The standardized extract was found to have a concentration-dependent effect on insulin release in vitro, which, however, is not mediated by γ-tocotrienol in rice bran (detected by HPLC) as could have been expected. Policosanol and γ-oryzanol have insulinotropic effects. The in vitro data of rice bran directly translate into in vivo data of rats by using a glucose tolerance test (increase in plasma insulin). Tocotrienols are well known for their apoptotic effect on tumor cells; nevertheless, an attempt was made to study glucose uptake in HEP-G2 cells, which needs to induce an insulin-resistant state by TNF-α. The Egyptian rice bran extract has an antidiabetic effect. γ-Oryzanol, which is a possible precursor of the insulinotropic compound ferulic acid, is a candidate for this effect. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the prevalence of diabetes or at least a prediabetic (type 2) situation can be ameliorated by the investigated rice bran extract. The potential usefulness of the extract as a nutraceutical is currently undergoing more thorough investigations.
22585409	Novel miRNAs in the control of arsenite levels in rice.	2012	Funct Integr Genomics	In a species, the miRNA repertoire comprises many lineage- or species-specific miRNAs. Using deep sequencing, the whole transcriptome of seedling roots was studied and a total of 18 novel miRNAs in indica rice Minghui 86 were identified. Among these novel miRNAs six were up-regulated and two were down-regulated under arsenite stress. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that miR6254 was predominantly expressed in roots relative to other tissues, whereas miR6250 and miR169i-3p were constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with high abundance in roots (miR6250) or leaves (miR169i-3p). The miR6250 and miR169i-3p miRNAs also exhibited distinct expression patterns in rice cultivars Minghui 86 and Nipponbare at different time points after arsenite treatment. The predicted targets for these miRNAs included some protein kinases, DNA, or ATP-binding proteins. Besides arsenite, the expression of targets of miR6250 and miR6254 was also up- or down-regulated in response to abiotic environmental stresses, indicative of their involvement in regulation of plant adaptation. Three types of cis-elements involved in hormone, light, and stress response were found to occur frequently in the promoter regions. Interestingly, miR6254 was originally characterized to be an exonic miRNA located in the exon of AK101391, supporting the notion that miRNAs may also originate from some exons in plants.
22617629	Chlorophyll index, photochemical reflectance index and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of rice leaves supplied with different N levels.	2012	J Photochem Photobiol B	Rapid and non-destructive diagnosis of plant N status is highly required in order to optimise N fertilizer management and use-efficiency. Additionally to handheld devices for measurements of chlorophyll indices (e.g., SPAD meter) parameters of canopy reflectance via remote sensing approaches are intensively investigated and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) appears to be a reliable indicator for changes of the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments. In order to assess the suitability of a handheld PRI as an additional tool for N diagnosis, rice plants were grown in a nutrient solution experiment with seven N-supply levels (0.18-5.71 mM) and CI (SPAD) and PRI values and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters measured 20 and 28 days after onset of treatments. N-supply had effects on both CI (SPAD) and PRI values with a more reliable differentiation between levels. Maximum quantum yield of PSII (F(v)/F(m)), actual efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Ф(PSII)) and regulated non-photochemical quenching (Ф(NPQ)) did not differ significantly between N levels. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and fast- relaxing NPQ (NPQ(F)) were significantly affected by N-supply. NPQ and NPQ(F), but not the slow-relaxing component (NPQ(S)), were correlated with CI (SPAD) and PRI values. This finding which has not been reported for N-supply effects so far is indirect evidence that low N-supply induced xanthophyll cycle activity and that PRI values are able to indicate this at least in plants subject to severe N deficiency.
22593226	Recent retrotransposon insertions are methylated and phylogenetically clustered in japonica rice (Oryza sativa spp. japonica).	2012	Mol Biol Evol	In plants, the genome of the host responds to the amplification of transposable elements (TEs) with DNA methylation. However, neither the factors involved in TE methylation nor the dynamics of the host-TE interaction are well resolved. Here, we identify 5,522 long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RT) in the genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and then assess methylation for individual elements. Our analyses uncover three strong trends: long LTR-RTs are more highly methylated, the insertion times of LTR-RTs are negatively correlated with methylation, and young LTR-RTs tend to be closer to genes than older insertions. Additionally, a phylogenetic examination of the gypsy-like LTR-RT superfamily revealed that methylation is phylogenetically correlated. Given these observations, we present a model suggesting that the phylogenetic correlation among related LTR-RTs is a primary mechanism driving methylation. In this model, bursts of transposition produce new elements with high sequence similarity. The host machinery identifies proliferating elements as well as closely related LTR-RTs through cross-homology. In addition, our data are consistent with previous hypotheses that methylated LTR-RT elements are removed preferentially from regions near genes, explaining some of the observed age distribution.
22761959	Salt stress induced variation in DNA methylation pattern and its influence on gene expression in contrasting rice genotypes.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Salinity is a major environmental factor limiting productivity of crop plants including rice in which wide range of natural variability exists. Although recent evidences implicate epigenetic mechanisms for modulating the gene expression in plants under environmental stresses, epigenetic changes and their functional consequences under salinity stress in rice are underexplored. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in plant's responses to environmental stresses. Better understanding of epigenetic regulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses may create novel heritable variation for crop improvement.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) technique was used to assess the effect of salt stress on extent and patterns of DNA methylation in four genotypes of rice differing in the degree of salinity tolerance. Overall, the amount of DNA methylation was more in shoot compared to root and the contribution of fully methylated loci was always more than hemi-methylated loci. Sequencing of ten randomly selected MSAP fragments indicated gene-body specific DNA methylation of retrotransposons, stress responsive genes, and chromatin modification genes, distributed on different rice chromosomes. Bisulphite sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of selected MSAP loci showed that cytosine methylation changes under salinity as well as gene expression varied with genotypes and tissue types irrespective of the level of salinity tolerance of rice genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The gene body methylation may have an important role in regulating gene expression in organ and genotype specific manner under salinity stress. Association between salt tolerance and methylation changes observed in some cases suggested that many methylation changes are not "directed". The natural genetic variation for salt tolerance observed in rice germplasm may be independent of the extent and pattern of DNA methylation which may have been induced by abiotic stress followed by accumulation through the natural selection process.
22709342	SUB1A-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the flooding tolerance of wild rice species.	2012	Plant J	Crop tolerance to flooding is an important agronomic trait. Although rice (Oryza sativa) is considered a flood-tolerant crop, only limited cultivars display tolerance to prolonged submergence, which is largely attributed to the presence of the SUB1A gene. Wild Oryza species have the potential to unveil adaptive mechanisms and shed light on the basis of submergence tolerance traits. In this study, we screened 109 Oryza genotypes belonging to different rice genome groups for flooding tolerance. Oryza nivara and Oryza rufipogon accessions, belonging to the A-genome group, together with Oryza sativa, showed a wide range of submergence responses, and the tolerance-related SUB1A-1 and the intolerance-related SUB1A-2 alleles were found in tolerant and sensitive accessions, respectively. Flooding-tolerant accessions of Oryza rhizomatis and Oryza eichingeri, belonging to the C-genome group, were also identified. Interestingly, SUB1A was absent in these species, which possess a SUB1 orthologue with high similarity to O. sativa SUB1C. The expression patterns of submergence-induced genes in these rice genotypes indicated limited induction of anaerobic genes, with classical anaerobic proteins poorly induced in O. rhizomatis under submergence. The results indicated that SUB1A-1 is not essential to confer submergence tolerance in the wild rice genotypes belonging to the C-genome group, which show instead a SUB1A-independent response to submergence.
22711693	Cold stress-induced acclimation in rice is mediated by root-specific aquaporins.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Cold acclimation process plays a vital role in the survival of chilling- and freezing-tolerant plants subjected to cold temperature stress. However, it remains elusive whether a cold acclimation process enhances root water uptake (a component of chilling tolerance) in chilling-sensitive crops such as rice. By analyzing the root hydraulic conductivity under cold stress for a prolonged time, we found that cold stress induced a gradual increase in root osmotic hydraulic conductivity [Lp(r(os))]. Compared with the control treatment (roots and shoots at 25°C), low root temperature (LRT) treatment (roots at 10°C; shoots at 25°C) dramatically reduced Lp(r(os)) within 1 h. However, Lp(r(os)) gradually increased during prolonged LRT treatment and it reached 10-fold higher values at day 5. Moreover, a coordinated up-regulation of root aquaporin gene expression, particularly OsPIP2;5, was observed during LRT treatment. Further, comparison of aquaporin gene expression under root-only chilling (LRT) and whole-plant chilling conditions, and in the roots of intact plants vs. shootless plants, suggests that a shoot to root signal is necessary for inducing the expression of aquaporin genes in the root. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a cold acclimation process for root water uptake functions in rice and is possibly regulated through aquaporins.
22843026	Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation of rice using two selectable marker genes derived from rice genome components.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	A method for Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) was developed using rice-derived selection markers. Two T-DNAs were efficiently introduced into separate loci using selectable marker gene cassettes consisting of the mutated acetolactate synthase gene (mALS) under the control of the callus-specific promoter (CSP) (CSP:mALS) and the ferredoxin nitrite reductase gene (NiR) under the control of its own promoter (NiR P:NiR). The CSP:mALS gene cassette confers sulfonylurea herbicide resistance to transgenic rice callus. The NiR P:NiR construct complements NiR-deficient mutant cultivars such as 'Koshihikari', which are defective in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism. In the present study, the CaMV35S:GUS and CaMV35S:GFP gene cassettes were co-introduced into the 'Koshihikari' genome using our system. Approximately 5-10 independent transgenic lines expressing both the GUS and GFP reporters were obtained from 100 Agrobacterium co-inoculated calli. Furthermore, transgenic 'Koshihikari' rice lines with reduced content of two major seed allergen proteins, the 33 and 14-16 kDa allergens, were generated by this co-transformation system. The present results indicate that the generation of selectable antibiotic resistance marker gene-free transgenic rice is possible using our rice-derived selection marker co-transformation system. Key message An improved rice transformation method was developed based on Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation using two rice genome-derived selectable marker gene cassettes.
22856683	Melatonin-rich transgenic rice plants exhibit resistance to herbicide-induced oxidative stress.	2013	J Pineal Res	To examine whether melatonin-rich plants can defend against oxidative stress, we subjected melatonin-rich transgenic (MRT) rice plants to the singlet-oxygen-generating herbicide butafenacil. Both MRT and transgenic control (TC; expressing the vector only) rice seeds germinated and grew equally well in continuous dark on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.1 μm butafenacil. However, after transferring the seedlings to light, the TCs rapidly necrotized, whereas the MRT seedlings showed resistant phenotypes. Seven-day-old MRT seedlings treated with 0.1 μm butafenacil were resistant to the herbicide and contained high chlorophyll levels and low malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents compared with the TCs. As they did before the herbicide treatment, the MRT plants also produced much more melatonin after the herbicide treatment than the TCs. In addition, the MRT plants exhibited higher superoxide dismutase and catalase activities before and after the herbicide treatment compared with the TCs. This is the first report showing that MRT plants exhibit resistance against a peroxidizing herbicide that acts by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill plants. This result indicates that melatonin scavenges ROS efficiently in vivo in the transgenic plants, leading to oxidative stress resistance.
22747776	Addition of transcription activator-like effector binding sites to a pathogen strain-specific rice bacterial blight resistance gene makes it effective against additional strains and against bacterial leaf streak.	2012	New Phytol	Xanthomonas transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors promote disease in plants by binding to and activating host susceptibility genes. Plants counter with TAL effector-activated executor resistance genes, which cause host cell death and block disease progression. We asked whether the functional specificity of an executor gene could be broadened by adding different TAL effector binding elements (EBEs) to it. We added six EBEs to the rice Xa27 gene, which confers resistance to strains of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) that deliver the TAL effector AvrXa27. The EBEs correspond to three other effectors from Xoo strain PXO99(A) and three from strain BLS256 of the bacterial leaf streak pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). Stable integration into rice produced healthy lines exhibiting gene activation by each TAL effector, and resistance to PXO99(A) , a PXO99(A) derivative lacking AvrXa27, and BLS256, as well as two other Xoo and 10 Xoc strains virulent toward wildtype Xa27 plants. Transcripts initiated primarily at a common site. Sequences in the EBEs were found to occur nonrandomly in rice promoters, suggesting an overlap with endogenous regulatory sequences. Thus, executor gene specificity can be broadened by adding EBEs, but caution is warranted because of the possible coincident introduction of endogenous regulatory elements.
22864386	Mapping and characterization of the major quantitative trait locus qSS7 associated with increased length and decreased width of rice seeds.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Seed shape in rice (Oryza sativa) is an important factor that determines grain appearance, cooking quality and grain yield. Here, we report a major quantitative trait locus qSS7 on the long arm of chromosome 7 for seed length, seed width and the ratio of seed length to width, identified using a segregating population derived from a cross between an indica variety Zhenshan97 and a chromosomal segment substitution line of a japonica variety Cypress within the genetic background of Zhenshan97. The Cypress allele at qSS7 contributes to an increase in seed length and the ratio of length to width, but a decrease in seed width, without significantly changing seed weight, plant height, heading date or number of spikelets per panicle. Using a large F(2) population generated from a substitution line that carries only a heterozygous single segment surrounding qSS7, we delimited the QTL to a 23-kb region containing two annotated genes. Progeny testing of the informative recombinants suggested that this qSS7 region is a composite QTL in which at least two genes contribute to seed length and width. Sequence comparison and expression analysis of two probable candidate genes revealed differences between the parental lines. These results will facilitate cloning of the gene(s) underlying qSS7 as well as marker-assisted transfer of desirable genes for seed shape in rice improvement.
22848789	Iron biofortification in rice by the introduction of multiple genes involved in iron nutrition.	2012	Sci Rep	To address the problem of iron-deficiency anemia, one of the most prevalent human micronutrient deficiencies globally, iron-biofortified rice was produced using three transgenic approaches: by enhancing iron storage in grains via expression of the iron storage protein ferritin using endosperm-specific promoters, enhancing iron translocation through overproduction of the natural metal chelator nicotianamine, and enhancing iron flux into the endosperm by means of iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2 expression under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter. Our results indicate that the iron concentration in greenhouse-grown T(2) polished seeds was sixfold higher and that in paddy field-grown T(3) polished seeds was 4.4-fold higher than that in non-transgenic seeds, with no defect in yield. Moreover, the transgenic seeds accumulated zinc up to 1.6-times in the field. Our results demonstrate that introduction of multiple iron homeostasis genes is more effective for iron biofortification than the single introduction of individual genes.
22805093	Arms race co-evolution of Magnaporthe oryzae AVR-Pik and rice Pik genes driven by their physical interactions.	2012	Plant J	Attack and counter-attack impose strong reciprocal selection on pathogens and hosts, leading to development of arms race evolutionary dynamics. Here we show that Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AVR-Pik and the cognate rice resistance (R) gene Pik are highly variable, with multiple alleles in which DNA replacements cause amino acid changes. There is tight recognition specificity of the AVR-Pik alleles by the various Pik alleles. We found that AVR-Pik physically binds the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Pik in a yeast two-hybrid assay as well as in an in planta co-immunoprecipitation assay. This binding specificity correlates with the recognition specificity between AVR and R genes. We propose that AVR-Pik and Pik are locked into arms race co-evolution driven by their direct physical interactions.
22772587	Allelic variation for a candidate gene for GS7, responsible for grain shape in rice.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Grain shape is an important component of end-use quality in rice. The genomic location of the grain shape QTL GS7 was narrowed to lie within a 4.8-kb segment on chromosome 7. The homologous region in cv. Nipponbare contains no annotated genes, while two open reading frames were predicted, one of which (ORF2) represented a likely candidate for GS7 gene on the basis of correlation between sequence variation and phenotype. Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of ORF2 transcription showed that the gene was active in both the leaf and panicle when the cv. D50 allele was present, but not in the presence of the cv. HB277 allele. A microsatellite-based phylogeny and a re-sequencing analysis of ORF2 among a set of 52 diverse rice accessions suggested that the cv. D50 GS7 allele may have originated from the tropical japonica genepool. The effect on grain length of the alternative alleles at GS7and GS3 showed that combination type 3/A was associated with longer grains than type 1/A. An Indel marker developed within the ORF2 sequence was informative for predicting grain length.
22811617	Differentially expressed genes distributed over chromosomes and implicated in certain biological processes for site insertion genetically modified rice Kemingdao.	2012	Int J Biol Sci	Release of genetically modified (GM) plants has sparked off intensive debates worldwide partly because of concerns about potential adverse unintended effects of GM plants to the agro system and the safety of foods. In this study, with the aim of revealing the molecular basis for unintended effects of a single site insertion GM Kemingdao (KMD) rice transformed with a synthetic cry1Ab gene, and bridging unintended effects of KMD rice through clues of differentially expressed genes, comparative transcriptome analyses were performed for GM KMD rice and its parent rice of Xiushui11 (XS11). The results showed that 680 differentially expressed transcripts were identified from 30-day old seedlings of GM KMD rice. The absolute majority of these changed expression transcripts dispersed and located over all rice chromosomes, and existed physical distance on chromosome from the insertion site, while only two transcripts were found to be differentially expressed within the 21 genes located within 100 kb up and down-stream of the insertion site. Pathway and biology function analyses further revealed that differentially expressed transcripts of KMD rice were involved in certain biological processes, and mainly implicated in two types of pathways. One type was pathways implicated in plant stress/defense responses, which were considerably in coordination with the reported unintended effects of KMD rice, which were more susceptible to rice diseases compared to its parent rice XS11; the other type was pathways associated with amino acids metabolism. With this clue, new unintended effects for changes in amino acids synthesis of KMD rice leaves were successfully revealed. Such that an actual case was firstly provided for identification of unintended effects in GM plants by comparative transciptome analysis.
22919301	Effect of long-term paddy-upland yearly rotations on rice (Oryza sativa) yield, soil properties, and bacteria community diversity.	2012	ScientificWorldJournal	A 10-year-long field trial (between 2001 and 2010) was conducted to investigate the effect of paddy-upland rotation on rice yield, soil properties, and bacteria community diversity. Six types of paddy-upland crop rotations were evaluated: rice-fallow (control; CK), rice-rye grass (RR), rice-potato with rice straw mulches (RP), rice-rapeseed with straw incorporated into soil at flowering (ROF), rice-rapeseed incorporated in soil after harvest (ROM), and rice-Chinese milk vetch (RC). Analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to determine microbial diversity among rotations. Rice yield increased for upland crops planted during the winter. RC had the highest average yield of 7.74 t/ha, followed by RR, RP, ROM, and ROF. Soil quality differences among rotations were found. RC and RP improved the soil mean weight diameter (MWD), which suggested that rice rotated with milk vetch and potato might improve the paddy soil structure. Improved total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic matter (SOM) were also found in RC and RP. The positive relationship between yield and TN/SOM might provide evidence for the effect of RC rotation on rice yield. A strong time dependency of soil bacterial community diversity was also found.
22912788	Indica and japonica crosses resulting in linkage block and recombination suppression on rice chromosome 12.	2012	PLoS One	Understanding linkage block size and molecular mechanisms of recombination suppression is important for plant breeding. Previously large linkage blocks ranging from 14 megabases to 27 megabases were observed around the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta in rice cultivars and backcross progeny involving an indica and japonica cross. In the present study, the same linkage block was further examined in 456 random recombinant individuals of rice involving 5 crosses ranging from F(2) to F(10) generation, with and without Pi-ta containing genomic indica regions with both indica and japonica germplasm. Simple sequence repeat markers spanning the entire chromosome 12 were used to detect recombination break points and to delimit physical size of linkage blocks. Large linkage blocks ranging from 4.1 megabases to 10 megabases were predicted from recombinant individuals involving genomic regions of indica and japonica. However, a significantly reduced block from less than 800 kb to 2.1megabases was identified from crosses of indica with indica rice regardless of the existence of Pi-ta. These findings suggest that crosses of indica and japonica rice have significant recombination suppression near the centromere on chromosome 12.
22912843	Comparative transcriptome profiling of chilling stress responsiveness in two contrasting rice genotypes.	2012	PLoS One	Rice is sensitive to chilling stress, especially at the seedling stage. To elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of chilling tolerance in rice, comprehensive gene expressions of two rice genotypes (chilling-tolerant LTH and chilling-sensitive IR29) with contrasting responses to chilling stress were comparatively analyzed. Results revealed a differential constitutive gene expression prior to stress and distinct global transcription reprogramming between the two rice genotypes under time-series chilling stress and subsequent recovery conditions. A set of genes with higher basal expression were identified in chilling-tolerant LTH compared with chilling-sensitive IR29, indicating their possible role in intrinsic tolerance to chilling stress. Under chilling stress, the major effect on gene expression was up-regulation in the chilling- tolerant genotype and strong repression in chilling-sensitive genotype. Early responses to chilling stress in both genotypes featured commonly up-regulated genes related to transcription regulation and signal transduction, while functional categories for late phase chilling regulated genes were diverse with a wide range of functional adaptations to continuous stress. Following the cessation of chilling treatments, there was quick and efficient reversion of gene expression in the chilling-tolerant genotype, while the chilling-sensitive genotype displayed considerably slower recovering capacity at the transcriptional level. In addition, the detection of differentially-regulated TF genes and enriched cis-elements demonstrated that multiple regulatory pathways, including CBF and MYBS3 regulons, were involved in chilling stress tolerance. A number of the chilling-regulated genes identified in this study were co-localized onto previously fine-mapped cold-tolerance-related QTLs, providing candidates for gene cloning and elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for chilling tolerance in rice.
22919327	Bioremediation of parboiled rice effluent supplemented with biodiesel-derived glycerol using Pichia pastoris X-33.	2012	ScientificWorldJournal	This paper describes the use of Pichia pastoris X-33 as a bioremediator to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and phosphorus (P-PO(4) (3-)), after culture in parboiled rice effluent supplemented with p.a. glycerol or a glycerol by-product of the biodiesel industry. The greatest reduction in the COD (55%), TKN (45%), and P-PO(4) (3-) (52%) of the effluent was observed in cultures of P. pastoris X-33 supplemented with 15 g.L(-1) of biodiesel-derived glycerol. Furthermore, the overall biomass yield was 2.1 g.L(-1). These data suggest that biodiesel-derived glycerol is an efficient carbon source for the bioremediation of parboiled rice effluent and biomass production.
22911586	Diversity of propanil-degrading bacteria isolated from rice rhizosphere and their potential for plant growth promotion.	2012	Genet Mol Res	The herbicide propanil has long been used in rice production in southern Brazil. Bacteria isolated from contaminated soils in Massaranduba, Santa Catarina, Brazil, were found to be able to grow in the presence of propanil, using this compound as a carbon source. Thirty strains were identified as Pseudomonas (86.7%), Serratia (10.0%), and Acinetobacter (3.3%), based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA. Little genetic diversity was found within species, more than 95% homology, suggesting that there is selective pressure to metabolize propanil in the microbial community. Two strains of Pseudomonas (AF7 and AF1) were selected in bioreactor containing chemotactic growth medium, with the highest degradation activity of propanil exhibited by strain AF7, followed by AF1 (60 and 40%, respectively). These strains when encapsulated in alginate exhibited a high survival rate and were able to colonize the rice root surfaces. Inoculation with Pseudomonas strains AF7 and AF1 significantly improved the plant height of rice. Most of the Pseudomonas strains produced indoleacetic acid, soluble mineral phosphate, and fixed nitrogen. These bacterial strains could potentially be used for the bioremediation of propanil-contaminated soils and the promotion of plant growth.
22687573	Metabolite profiles of rice cultivars containing bacterial blight-resistant genes are distinctive from susceptible rice.	2012	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	The metabolic changes of bacterial blight-resistant line C418/Xa23 generated by molecular marker-assisted selection (n= 12), transgenic variety C418-Xa21 generated by using the Agrobacterium-mediated system (n= 12), and progenitor cultivar C418 (n= 12) were monitored using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The validation, discrimination, and establishment of correlative relationships between metabolite signals were performed by cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis. Significant and unintended changes were observed in 154 components in C418/Xa23 and 48 components in C418-Xa21 compared with C418 (P< 0.05, Fold change > 2.0). The most significant decreases detected (P< 0.001) in both C418/Xa23 and C418-Xa21 were in three amino acids: glycine, tyrosine, and alanine, and four identified metabolites: malic acid, ferulic acid, succinic acid, and glycerol. Linoleic acid was increased specifically in C418/Xa23 which was derived from traditional breeding. This line, possessing a distinctive metabolite profile as a positive control, shows more differences vs. the parental than the transgenic line. Only succinic acid that falls outside the boundaries of natural variability between the two non-transgenic varieties C418 and C418/Xa23 should be further investigated with respect to safety or nutritional impact.
22905132	Molecular evolution of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) gene family in Populus, Arabidopsis and rice.	2012	PLoS One	Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) plays important roles in trehalose metabolism and signaling. Plant TPS proteins contain both a TPS and a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) domain, which are coded by a multi-gene family. The plant TPS gene family has been divided into class I and class II. A previous study showed that the Populus, Arabidopsis, and rice genomes have seven class I and 27 class II TPS genes. In this study, we found that all class I TPS genes had 16 introns within the protein-coding region, whereas class II TPS genes had two introns. A significant sequence difference between the two classes of TPS proteins was observed by pairwise sequence comparisons of the 34 TPS proteins. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that at least seven TPS genes were present in the monocot-dicot common ancestor. Segmental duplications contributed significantly to the expansion of this gene family. At least five and three TPS genes were created by segmental duplication events in the Populus and rice genomes, respectively. Both the TPS and TPP domains of 34 TPS genes have evolved under purifying selection, but the selective constraint on the TPP domain was more relaxed than that on the TPS domain. Among 34 TPS genes from Populus, Arabidopsis, and rice, four class I TPS genes (AtTPS1, OsTPS1, PtTPS1, and PtTPS2) were under stronger purifying selection, whereas three Arabidopsis class I TPS genes (AtTPS2, 3, and 4) apparently evolved under relaxed selective constraint. Additionally, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed the expression divergence of the TPS gene family in Populus, Arabidopsis, and rice under normal growth conditions and in response to stressors. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of gene family expansion and functional evolution.
22870386	SNP in starch biosynthesis genes associated with nutritional and functional properties of rice.	2012	Sci Rep	Starch is a major component of human diets. The relative contribution of variation in the genes of starch biosynthesis to the nutritional and functional properties of the rice was evaluated in a rice breeding population. Sequencing 18 genes involved in starch synthesis in a population of 233 rice breeding lines discovered 66 functional SNPs in exonic regions. Five genes, AGPS2b, Isoamylase1, SPHOL, SSIIb and SSIVb showed no polymorphism. Association analysis found 31 of the SNP were associated with differences in pasting and cooking quality properties of the rice lines. Two genes appear to be the major loci controlling traits under human selection in rice, GBSSI (waxy gene) and SSIIa. GBSSI influenced amylose content and retrogradation. Other genes contributing to retrogradation were GPT1, SSI, BEI and SSIIIa. SSIIa explained much of the variation in cooking characteristics. Other genes had relatively small effects.
22562145	Mapping quantitative trait loci conferring resistance to rice black-streaked virus in maize (Zea mays L.).	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is one of the most serious virus diseases of maize worldwide, and it causes great reduction of maize production. In China, the pathogen was shown to be rice black-streaked virus (RBSDV). Currently, MRDD has spread broadly and leads to significant loss in China. However, there has been little research devoted to this disease. Our aims were to identify the markers and loci underlying resistance to this virus disease. In this study, segregation populations were constructed from two maize elite lines '90110', which is highly resistant to MRDD and 'Ye478', which is highly susceptible to MRDD. The F(2) and BC(1) populations were used for bulk sergeant analysis (BSA) to identify resistance-related markers. One hundred and twenty F(7:9) RILs were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping through the experiment of multiple environments over 3 years. Natural occurrence and artificial inoculation were both used and combined to determine the phenotype of plants. Five QTL, qMRD2, qMRD6, qMRD7, qMRD8 and qMRD10 were measured in the experiments. The qMRD8 on chromosome 8 was proved to be one major QTL conferring resistance to RBSDV disease in almost all traits and environments, which explained 12.0-28.9 % of the phenotypic variance for disease severity in this present study.
22616023	Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica.	2012	AoB Plants	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Salt stress leads to attenuated growth and productivity in rice. Transcription factors like heat shock factors (HSFs) represent central regulators of stress adaptation. Heat shock factors of the classes A and B are well established as regulators of thermal and non-thermal stress responses in plants; however, the role of class C HSFs is unknown. Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice.

METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment. For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment. In addition, we quantified the expression of small Heat Shock Protein (sHSP) genes and those related to signalling and ion homeostasis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in roots exposed to salt. The subcellular localization of OsHsfC1b protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was determined in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts.

PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Expression of OsHsfC1b was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H(2)O(2). Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis. Furthermore, sHSP genes showed enhanced expression in knock-down plants under salt stress. We observed retarded growth of hsfc1b and knock-down lines in comparison with control plants under non-stress conditions. Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor.

CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice. Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.
22509807	Proteomics insight into the biological safety of transgenic modification of rice as compared with conventional genetic breeding and spontaneous genotypic variation.	2012	J Proteome Res	The potential of unintended effects caused by transgenic events is a key issue in the commercialization of genetically modified (GM) crops. To investigate whether transgenic events cause unintended effects, we used comparative proteomics approaches to evaluate proteome differences in seeds from 2 sets of GM indica rice, herbicide-resistant Bar68-1 carrying bar and insect-resistant 2036-1a carrying cry1Ac/sck, and their respective controls D68 and MH86, as well as indica variety MH63, a parental line for breeding MH86, and japonica variety ZH10. This experimental design allowed for comparing proteome difference caused by transgenes, conventional genetic breeding, and natural genetic variation. Proteomics analysis revealed the maximum numbers of differentially expressed proteins between indica and japonica cultivars, second among indica varieties with relative small difference between MH86 and MH63, and the minimum between GM rice and respective control, thus indicating GM events do not substantially alter proteome profiles as compared with conventional genetic breeding and natural genetic variation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed 234 proteins differentially expressed in the 6 materials, and these proteins were involved in different cellular and metabolic processes with a prominent skew toward metabolism (31.2%), protein synthesis and destination (25.2%), and defense response (22.4%). In these seed proteomes, proteins implicated in the 3 prominent biological processes showed significantly different composite expression patterns and were major factors differentiating japonica and indica cultivars, as well as indica varieties. Thus, metabolism, protein synthesis and destination, and defense response in seeds are important in differentiating rice cultivars and varieties.

22566494	Posttranscriptional control of photosynthetic mRNA decay under stress conditions requires 3' and 5' untranslated regions and correlates with differential polysome association in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Abiotic stress, including drought, salinity, and temperature extremes, regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Expression profiling of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from rice (Oryza sativa) leaves grown under stress conditions revealed that the transcript levels of photosynthetic genes are reduced more rapidly than others, a phenomenon referred to as stress-induced mRNA decay (SMD). By comparing RNA polymerase II engagement with the steady-state mRNA level, we show here that SMD is a posttranscriptional event. The SMD of photosynthetic genes was further verified by measuring the half-lives of the small subunit of Rubisco (RbcS1) and Chlorophyll a/b-Binding Protein1 (Cab1) mRNAs during stress conditions in the presence of the transcription inhibitor cordycepin. To discern any correlation between SMD and the process of translation, changes in total and polysome-associated mRNA levels after stress were measured. Total and polysome-associated mRNA levels of two photosynthetic (RbcS1 and Cab1) and two stress-inducible (Dehydration Stress-Inducible Protein1 and Salt-Induced Protein) genes were found to be markedly similar. This demonstrated the importance of polysome association for transcript stability under stress conditions. Microarray experiments performed on total and polysomal mRNAs indicate that approximately half of all mRNAs that undergo SMD remain polysome associated during stress treatments. To delineate the functional determinant(s) of mRNAs responsible for SMD, the RbcS1 and Cab1 transcripts were dissected into several components. The expressions of different combinations of the mRNA components were analyzed under stress conditions, revealing that both 3' and 5' untranslated regions are necessary for SMD. Our results, therefore, suggest that the posttranscriptional control of photosynthetic mRNA decay under stress conditions requires both 3' and 5' untranslated regions and correlates with differential polysome association.
22522577	Mercury-induced biochemical and proteomic changes in rice roots.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Mercury (Hg) is a serious environmental pollution threats to the planet. Accumulation of Hg in plants disrupts many cellular-level functions and inhibits growth and development, but the mechanism is not fully understood. We investigated cellular, biochemical and proteomic changes in rice roots under Hg stress. Root growth rate was decreased and Hg, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and lipoxygenase activity were increased significantly with increasing Hg concentration in roots. We revealed a time-dependent alteration in total glutathione content and enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) during Hg stress. 2-D electrophoresis revealed differential expression of 25 spots with Hg treatment of roots: 14 spots were upregulated and 11 spots downregulated. These differentially expressed proteins were identified by ESI-MS/MS to be involved in cellular functions including redox and hormone homeostasis, chaperone activity, metabolism, and transcription regulation. These results may provide new insights into the molecular basis of the Hg stress response in plants.
22705591	Thiamine primed defense provides reliable alternative to systemic fungicide carbendazim against sheath blight disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	A novel pathogen defense strategy by thiamine priming was evaluated for its efficacy against sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani AG-1A, of rice and compared with that of systemic fungicide, carbendazim (BCM). Seeds of semidwarf, high yielding, basmati rice variety Vasumati were treated with thiamine (50 mM) and BCM (4 mM). The pot cultured plants were challenge inoculated with R. solani after 40 days of sowing and effect of thiamine and BCM on rice growth and yield traits was examined. Higher hydrogen peroxide content, total phenolics accumulation, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity under thiamine treatment displayed elevated level of systemic resistance, which was further augmented under challenging pathogen infection. High transcript level of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) validated mode of thiamine primed defense. Though minimum disease severity was observed under BCM treatment, thiamine produced comparable results, with 18.12 per cent lower efficacy. Along with fortifying defense components and minor influence on photosynthetic pigments and nitrate reductase (NR) activity, thiamine treatment significantly reduced pathogen-induced loss in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, NR activity and NR transcript level. Physiological traits affected under pathogen infection were found signatory for characterizing plant's response under disease and were detectable at early stage of infection. These findings provide a novel paradigm for developing alternative, environmentally safe strategies to control plant diseases.
22570626	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice.	2012	PLoS Genet	Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate rice plant architecture, including leaf bending, which affects grain yield. Although BR signaling has been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana, the components negatively regulating this pathway are less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway. The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending. Quantitative PCR revealed LIC transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment. Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment LIC proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Phosphorylation assay in vitro revealed LIC phosphorylated by GSK3-like kinases. For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay. LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1. Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1. Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC. Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels. Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1. The phenotypes of lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture. Improving this phenotype may be a potential approach to molecular breeding for high yield in rice.
22606331	Non-uniform distribution pattern for differentially expressed genes of transgenic rice Huahui 1 at different developmental stages and environments.	2012	PLoS One	DNA microarray analysis is an effective method to detect unintended effects by detecting differentially expressed genes (DEG) in safety assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops. With the aim to reveal the distribution of DEG of GM crops under different conditions, we performed DNA microarray analysis using transgenic rice Huahui 1 (HH1) and its non-transgenic parent Minghui 63 (MH63) at different developmental stages and environmental conditions. Considerable DEG were selected in each group of HH1 under different conditions. For each group of HH1, the number of DEG was different; however, considerable common DEG were shared between different groups of HH1. These findings suggested that both DEG and common DEG were adequate for investigation of unintended effects. Furthermore, a number of significantly changed pathways were found in all groups of HH1, indicating genetic modification caused everlasting changes to plants. To our knowledge, our study for the first time provided the non-uniformly distributed pattern for DEG of GM crops at different developmental stages and environments. Our result also suggested that DEG selected in GM plants at specific developmental stage and environment could act as useful clues for further evaluation of unintended effects of GM plants.
22609438	Crystal structure of rice Rubisco and implications for activation induced by positive effectors NADPH and 6-phosphogluconate.	2012	J Mol Biol	The key enzyme of plant photosynthesis, D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), must be activated to become catalytically competent via the carbamylation of Lys201 of the large subunit and subsequent stabilization by Mg(2+) coordination. Many biochemical studies have reported that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) function as positive effectors to promote activation. However, the structural mechanism remains unknown. Here, we have determined the crystal structures of activated rice Rubisco in complex with NADPH, 6PG, or 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (2CABP). The structures of the NADPH and 6PG complexes adopt open-state conformations, in which loop 6 at the catalytic site and some other loops are disordered. The structure of the 2CABP complex is in a closed state, similar to the previous 2CABP-bound activated structures from other sources. The catalytic sites of the NADPH and 6PG complexes are fully activated, despite the fact that bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) was not added into the crystallization solution. In the catalytic site, NADPH does not interact with Mg(2+) directly but interacts with Mg(2+)-coordinated water molecules, while 6PG interacts with Mg(2+) directly. These observations suggest that the two effectors promote Rubisco activation by stabilizing the complex of Mg(2+) and the carbamylated Lys201 with unique interactions and preventing its dissociation. The structure also reveals that the relaxed complex of the effectors (NADPH or 6PG), distinct from the tight-binding mode of 2CABP, would allow rapid exchange of the effectors in the catalytic sites by substrate D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate for catalysis in physiological conditions.
22715111	Semi-rolled leaf1 encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein and modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating the formation of bulliform cells.	2012	Plant Physiol	Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding and moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and grain yields. Although a few rolled-leaf mutants have been identified and some genes controlling leaf rolling have been isolated, the molecular mechanisms of leaf rolling still need to be elucidated. Here we report the isolation and characterization of SEMI-ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1), a gene involved in the regulation of leaf rolling. Mutants srl1-1 (point mutation) and srl1-2 (transferred DNA insertion) exhibit adaxially rolled leaves due to the increased numbers of bulliform cells at the adaxial cell layers, which could be rescued by complementary expression of SRL1. SRL1 is expressed in various tissues and is expressed at low levels in bulliform cells. SRL1 protein is located at the plasma membrane and predicted to be a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Moreover, analysis of the gene expression profile of cells that will become epidermal cells in wild type but probably bulliform cells in srl1-1 by laser-captured microdissection revealed that the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (subunits A, B, C, and D) and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which are increased during the formation of bulliform cells, were up-regulated in srl1-1. These results provide the transcript profile of rice leaf cells that will become bulliform cells and demonstrate that SRL1 regulates leaf rolling through inhibiting the formation of bulliform cells by negatively regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which will help to understand the mechanism regulating leaf rolling.
22751322	Rice heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunits (RGG1 and RGG2) are differentially regulated under abiotic stress.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Heterotrimeric G-proteins (α, β and γ subunits) are primarily involved in diverse signaling processes by transducing signals from an activated transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) to appropriate downstream effectors within cells. The role of α and β G-protein subunits in salinity and heat stress has been reported but the regulation of γ subunit of plant G-proteins in response to abiotic stress has not heretofore been described. In the present study we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs of two isoforms of Gγ [RGG1(I), 282 bp and RGG2(I), 453 bp] from rice (Oryza sativa cv Indica group Swarna) and described their transcript regulation in response to abiotic stresses. Protein sequence alignment and pairwise comparison of γ subunits of Indica rice [RGG(I)] with other known plant G-protein γ subunits demonstrated high homology to barley (HvGs) while soybean (GmG2) and Arabidopsis (AGG1) were least related. The numbers of the exons and introns were found to be similar between RGG1(I) and RGG2(I), but their sizes were different. Analyses of promoter sequences of RGG(I) confirmed the presence of stress-related cis-regulatory signature motifs suggesting their active and possible independent roles in abiotic stress signaling. The transcript levels of RGG1(I) and RGG2(I) were upregulated following NaCl, cold, heat and ABA treatments. However, in drought stress only RGG1(I) was upregulated. Strong support by transcript profiling suggests that γ subunits play a critical role via cross talk in signaling pathways. These findings provide first direct evidence for roles of Gγ subunits of rice G-proteins in regulation of abiotic stresses. These findings suggest the possible exploitation of γ subunits of G-protein machinery for promoting stress tolerance in plants.
22670578	TaCKX6-D1, the ortholog of rice OsCKX2, is associated with grain weight in hexaploid wheat.	2012	New Phytol	The cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) gene plays a principal role in controlling cytokinin levels and has been shown to be a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting grain number in rice. However, the function and evaluation of the haplotypes of the wheat CKX gene have yet to be illustrated. In this study, TaCKX6-D1, a wheat ortholog of rice OsCKX2, was cloned and its haplotype variants were determined to be significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight on the basis of linkage mapping, association analysis and gene expression analysis. Five TaCKX6-D1 haplotypes, designated a-e, were identified. An indel marker was developed to identify haplotype a, which was associated with higher grain weight. Haplotype a showed decreased expression relative to haplotype b in seeds at 8 d after pollination. Sequence variations among modern cultivars, landraces and wild species suggest a significant domestication signature at the TaCKX6-D1 locus in Chinese wheat germplasm. TaCKX6-D1 may serve as a useful gene for the breeding of high-yielding wheat. A strategy for allele mining and utilization of TaCKX6-D1 was proposed. Our study also sheds light on the mechanisms of grain development and domestication of wheat, as well as the functional divergence of orthologs in comparative genomics.
22751999	Fine mapping and identification of candidate rice genes associated with qSTV11(SG), a major QTL for rice stripe disease resistance.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Rice stripe disease, caused by rice stripe virus (RSV) is a serious constraint to rice production in subtropical regions of East Asia. We performed fine mapping of a RSV resistance QTL on chromosome 11, qSTV11 ( SG ), using near-isogenic lines (NILs, BC(6)F(4)) derived from a cross between the highly resistant variety, Shingwang, and the highly susceptible variety, Ilpum, using 11 insertion and deletion (InDel) markers. qSTV11 ( SG ) was localized to a 150-kb region between InDel 11 (17.86 Mbp) and InDel 5 (18.01 Mbp). Among the two markers in this region, InDel 7 is diagnostic of RSV resistance in 55 Korean japonica and indica rice varieties. InDel 7 could also distinguish the allele type of Nagdong, Shingwang, Mudgo, and Pe-bi-hun from Zenith harboring the Stv-b ( i ) allele. As a result, qSTV11 ( SG ) is likely to be the Stv-b ( i ) allele. There were 21 genes in the 150-kb region harboring the qSTV11 ( SG ) locus. Three of these genes, LOC_Os11g31430, LOC_Os11g31450, and LOC_Os11g31470, were exclusively expressed in the susceptible variety. These expression profiles were consistent with the quantitative nature along with incomplete dominance of RSV resistance. Sequencing of these genes showed that there were several amino acid substitutions between susceptible and resistant varieties. Putative functions of these candidate genes for qSTV11 (SG) are discussed.
22805217	[Ghd7, a pleiotropic gene controlling flag leaf area in rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	Photosynthesis is the unique source of energy for plant. Flag leaf contributed the majority of photosynthate after rice flowering. Ghd7 is a pleiotropic gene, which can significantly increase rice production. In order to study the genetic effects of Ghd7 on the flag leaf morphology, we made quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), and flag leaf area (FLA) using a Ghd7-BC2F2 population of 190 plants. In the BC2F2 population, the frequency distribution of FLL, FLW, and FLA were bimodal and in agreement with single Mendelian segregation ratio (3:1). FLL, FLW, and FLA were positively correlated with grains per panicle in the population. One QTL was mapped to the in-terval between markers RM3859 and C39 on chromosome 7, which explained 73.3%, 62.3%, and 71.8% of the variations for FLL, FLW, and FLA, and co-segregated with Ghd7. Two near-isogenic lines of NIL (mh7) and NIL (tq7) were devel-oped using Zhenshan 97 as the recurrent parent and Minghui 63 and Teqing as the donor parent, respectively. Both NILs significantly increased the phenotypic values of FLL, FLW, and FLA as compared with Zhenshan 97. FLL, The values of FLW and FLA for Ghd7 over-expression transgenic plants were 8.9 cm, 0.5 cm, and 17.8 cm2 larger than its recipient Heji-ang 19. These results demonstrated that Ghd7 plays an important role in controlling the flag leaf area in rice.
22701725	Decline in topsoil microbial quotient, fungal abundance and C utilization efficiency of rice paddies under heavy metal pollution across South China.	2012	PLoS One	Agricultural soils have been increasingly subject to heavy metal pollution worldwide. However, the impacts on soil microbial community structure and activity of field soils have been not yet well characterized. Topsoil samples were collected from heavy metal polluted (PS) and their background (BGS) fields of rice paddies in four sites across South China in 2009. Changes with metal pollution relative to the BGS in the size and community structure of soil microorganisms were examined with multiple microbiological assays of biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) measurement, plate counting of culturable colonies and phospholipids fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis along with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene and real-time PCR assay. In addition, a 7-day lab incubation under constantly 25°C was conducted to further track the changes in metabolic activity. While the decrease under metal pollution in MBC and MBN, as well as in culturable population size, total PLFA contents and DGGE band numbers of bacteria were not significantly and consistently seen, a significant reduction was indeed observed under metal pollution in microbial quotient, in culturable fungal population size and in ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs consistently across the sites by an extent ranging from 6% to 74%. Moreover, a consistently significant increase in metabolic quotient was observed by up to 68% under pollution across the sites. These observations supported a shift of microbial community with decline in its abundance, decrease in fungal proportion and thus in C utilization efficiency under pollution in the soils. In addition, ratios of microbial quotient, of fungal to bacterial and qCO(2) are proved better indicative of heavy metal impacts on microbial community structure and activity. The potential effects of these changes on C cycling and CO(2) production in the polluted rice paddies deserve further field studies.
22685088	Influence of low air humidity and low root temperature on water uptake, growth and aquaporin expression in rice plants.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	The effects of low air humidity and low root temperature (LRT) on water uptake, growth and aquaporin gene expression were investigated in rice plants. The daily transpiration of the plants grown at low humidity was 1.5- to 2-fold higher than that at high humidity. LRT at 13°C reduced transpiration, and the extent was larger at lower humidity. LRT also reduced total dry matter production and leaf area expansion, and the extent was again larger at lower humidity. These observations suggest that the suppression of plant growth by LRT is associated with water stress due to decreased water uptake ability of the root. On the other hand, the net assimilation rate was not affected by low humidity and LRT, and water use efficiency was larger for LRT. We found that low humidity induced coordinated up-regulation of many PIP and TIP aquaporin genes in both the leaves and the roots. Expression levels of two root-specific aquaporin genes, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;5, were increased significantly after 6 and 13 d of LRT exposure. Taken together, we discuss the possibility that aquaporins are part of an integrated response of this crop to low air humidity and LRT.
22672582	Identification and expression analysis of components involved in rice Xa21-mediated disease resistance signalling.	2012	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Rice Xa21 gene encodes a receptor-like kinase that confers broad-spectrum resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Recently, a number of genes involved in the Xa21-mediated disease resistance pathway have been identified. Based on our previous data and the literature, we chose 16 candidate proteins and made corresponding antibodies. Using Western blotting, we systematically investigated the expression profile of the proteins in Xa21-mediated disease resistance response. We found nine proteins with altered expression. We further compared their expression in resistance, susceptible and mock responses, and found that GST expression was up-regulated during the resistance process, indicating GST is a positive regulator in resistance responses. ATPsB expression was down-regulated during both the resistance and susceptible response processes, although it was higher in the resistance response than that in the susceptible response. The total amount of MYB, GAPDH, CatB, Trx and NB-ARC proteins was lower in the resistance than in the susceptible response, but their abundance per unit bacteria in the resistance response was still higher than in the susceptible response, suggesting that these proteins might be positive regulators in the resistance response. In addition, expression of another ERF was induced by inoculation with bacterial blight pathogen, and expression of Zf-LSD1 was activated by wounding stress alone. Interestingly, most proteins showed similar altered expression patterns in the resistance and susceptible responses, but differed to some extents, implying that both responses might share common molecular mechanisms. This study revealed evidence of resistance-related protein expression, providing a foundation for better understanding of their functions.
22660631	The contribution of intersubspecific hybridization to the breeding of super-high-yielding japonica rice in northeast China.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Hybridization between indica and japonica rice combined with utilization of ideal plant type has led to the development of high-yielding japonica rice in northern China. However, the contribution at the genomic level of intersubspecific hybridization to the increased yield of northern Chinese japonica rice is uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the genomic pedigree of descendants of hybridization between indica and japonica rice grown in northeastern China between 1963 and 2008. Simple sequence repeat markers indicated that since 1990 the genetic diversity among northern japonica cultivars was enriched. Genome-wide analysis with subspecies-specific indel and intron length polymorphism markers showed indica-allele frequencies were significantly increased in cultivars bred after 1990, and were significantly positively correlated with spikelet number per panicle and significantly negatively correlated with panicle number per plant. Among eight genes controlling agronomic traits, GN1a and GS3 were partially fixed in the genome of northern japonica cultivars. In contrast, Waxy and qSH1 were eliminated, whereas DEP1 and qSW5 were retained. Indica germplasm is an important contributor to the increased yield of northern japonica rice. Breeding for high yield and grain quality in combination is a complicated process and difficult to achieve when relying on only one or several functional genes, thus the selection expertise of the breeder remains critical.
22734689	In silico analysis of expression data for identification of genes involved in spatial accumulation of calcium in developing seeds of rice.	None	OMICS	The calcium (Ca(2+)) transporters, like Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) ATPases, and Ca(2+) exchangers, are instrumental for signaling and transport. However, the mechanism by which they orchestrate the accumulation of Ca(2+) in grain filling has not yet been investigated. Hence the present study was designed to identify the potential calcium transporter genes that may be responsible for the spatial accumulation of calcium during grain filling. In silico expression analyses were performed to identify Ca(2+) transporters that predominantly express during the different developmental stages of Oryza sativa. A total of 13 unique calcium transporters (7 from massively parallel signature sequencing [MPSS] data analysis, and 9 from microarray analysis) were identified. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed differential expression of the transporters across tissues, and principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited their seed-specific distinctive expression profile. Interestingly, Ca(2+) exchanger genes are highly expressed in the initial stages, whereas some Ca(2+) ATPase genes are highly expressed throughout seed development. Furthermore, analysis of the cis-elements located in the promoter region of the subset of 13 genes suggested that D of proteins play essential roles in regulating the expression of Ca(2+) transporter genes during rice seed development. Based on these results, we developed a hypothetical model explaining the transport and tissue specific distribution of calcium in developing cereal seeds. The model may be extrapolated to understand the mechanism behind the exceptionally high level of calcium accumulation seen in grains like finger millet.
22693960	The C2H2-type zinc finger protein ZFP182 is involved in abscisic acid-induced antioxidant defense in rice.	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	C(2) H(2) -type zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are thought to play important roles in modulating the responses of plants to drought, salinity and oxidative stress. However, direct evidence is lacking for the involvement of these ZFPs in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defense in plants. In this study, the role of the rice (Oryza sativa L. sub. japonica cv. Nipponbare) C(2) H(2) -type ZFP ZFP182 in ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the relationship between ZFP182 and two rice MAPKs, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 in ABA signaling were investigated. ABA treatment induced the increases in the expression of ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in rice leaves. The transient gene expression analysis and the transient RNA interference (RNAi) analysis in protoplasts showed that ZFP182, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 are involved in ABA-induced up-regulation in the activities of SOD and APX. Besides, OsMPK1 and OsMPK5 were shown to be required for the up-regulation in the expression of ZFP182 in ABA signaling, but ZFP182 did not mediate the ABA-induced up-regulation in the expression of OsMPK1 and OsMPK5. These results indicate that ZFP182 is required for ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the expression of ZFP182 is regulated by rice MAPKs in ABA signaling.
22829719	In silico model of DSF synthase RpfF protein from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae: a novel target for bacterial blight of rice disease.	2012	Bioinformation	BACKGROUND: Rice plant diseases play a major role as biological constraints on production. One of such rice disease is bacterial leaf blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo). The diffusible signal factor (DSF) synthesized by Xoo has a major role in virulence to rice plant. The DSF synthase RpfF protein, which is related to crotonase superfamily is responsible for the maintaining concentration of DSF. DSF-dependent quorum sensing (QS) system adopts protein- protein interaction mechanism to auto regulates the production of DSF. The antibacterial activity of pesticides against Xoo has not yet been completely understood. Three dimensional structure of RpfF protein was predicted using homology modeling method by MODELLER 9V9 software, SWISS MODEL and GENO3D online tools and structures were validated by Ramachandran plot, TM-Score and RMSD. 3D structure of RpfF (accession number AAL06345) was predicted using DSF synthase of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) (PDB ID: 3M6M) as a template. The stereo chemical check reveals the structure developed from the modeller was the best one and the potential ligand binding sites were identified by CASTp Server. The predicted RpfF model provides insight into its structure, active sites and aid in the development of novel inhibitors to control bacterial leaf blight in rice plant. DSF synthase RpfF protein could be used as a novel target to control infection.
22676236	Involvement of ASR genes in aluminium tolerance mechanisms in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Environ	Among cereal crops, rice is considered the most tolerant to aluminium (Al). However, variability among rice genotypes leads to remarkable differences in the degree of Al tolerance for distinct cultivars. A number of studies have demonstrated that rice plants achieve Al tolerance through an unknown mechanism that is independent of root tip Al exclusion. We have analysed expression changes of the rice ASR gene family as a function of Al treatment. The gene ASR5 was differentially regulated in the Al-tolerant rice ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. However, ASR5 expression did not respond to Al exposure in Indica cv. Taim rice roots, which are highly Al sensitive. Transgenic plants carrying RNAi constructs that targeted the ASR genes were obtained, and increased Al susceptibility was observed in T1 plants. Embryogenic calli of transgenic rice carrying an ASR5-green fluorescent protein fusion revealed that ASR5 was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Using a proteomic approach to compare non-transformed and ASR-RNAi plants, a total of 41 proteins with contrasting expression patterns were identified. We suggest that the ASR5 protein acts as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of different genes that collectively protect rice cells from Al-induced stress responses.
22686401	Marker-free site-specific gene integration in rice based on the use of two recombination systems.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Transgene integration mediated by heterologous site-specific recombination (SSR) systems into the dedicated genomic sites has been demonstrated in a few different plant species. This approach of plant transformation generates a precise site-specific integration (SSI) structure consisting of a single copy of the transgene construct. As a result, stable transgene expression correlated with promoter strength and gene copy number is observed among independent transgenic lines and faithfully transmitted through subsequent generations. Site-specific integration approaches use selectable marker genes, removal of which is necessary for the implementation of this approach as a biotechnology application. As SSR systems are also excellent tools for excising marker genes from transgene locus, a molecular strategy involving gene integration followed by marker excision, each mediated by a distinct recombination system, was earlier proposed. Experimental validation of this approach is the focus of this work. Using FLPe-FRT system for site-specific gene integration and heat-inducible Cre-lox for marker gene excision, marker-free SSI lines were developed in the first generation itself. More importantly, progeny derived from these lines inherited the marker-free locus, indicating efficient germinal transmission. Finally, as the transgene expression from SSI locus was not altered upon marker excision, this method is suitable for streamlining the production of marker-free SSI lines.
22678666	Identification of QTLs with main, epistatic and QTL × environment interaction effects for salt tolerance in rice seedlings under different salinity conditions.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	Salt tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) at the seedling stage is one of the major determinants of its stable establishment in saline soil. One population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F (2:9)) derived from a cross between the salt-tolerant variety Jiucaiqing and the salt-sensitive variety IR26 was used to determine the genetic mechanism of four salt tolerance indices, seedling height (SH), dry shoot weight (DSW), dry root weight (DRW) and Na/K ratios (Na/K) in roots after 10 days in three salt concentrations (0.0, 0.5 and 0.7 % NaCl). The main effect QTLs (M-QTLs) and epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) were detected by QTL IciMapping program using single environment phenotypic values. Eleven M-QTLs and 11 E-QTLs were identified for the salt tolerance indices. There were six M-QTLs and two E-QTLs identified for SH, three M-QTLs and five E-QTLs identified for DSW, two M-QTLs and one E-QTL identified for DRW, and three E-QTLs identified for Na/K. The phenotypic variation explained by each M-QTL and E-QTL ranged from 7.8 to 23.9 % and 13.3 to 73.7 %, respectively. The QTL-by-environment interactions were detected by QTLNetwork program in the joint analyses of multi-environment phenotypic values. Six M-QTLs and five E-QTLs were identified. The phenotypic variation explained by each QTL and QTL × environment interaction ranged from 0.95 to 6.90 % and 0.02 to 0.50 %, respectively. By comparing chromosomal positions of these M-QTLs with those previously identified, five M-QTLs qSH1.3, qSH12.1, qSH12.2, qDSW12.1 and qDRW11 might represent novel salt tolerance genes. Five selected RILs with high salt tolerance had six to eight positive alleles of the M-QTLs, indicating that pyramiding by marker-assisted selection (MAS) of M-QTLs can be applied in rice salt tolerance breeding programs.
22835979	Dissecting the genetic basis of extremely large grain shape in rice cultivar 'JZ1560'.	2012	J Genet Genomics	Rice grain shape, grain length (GL), width (GW), thickness (GT) and length-to-width ratio (LWR), are usually controlled by multiple quantitative trait locus (QTL). To elucidate the genetic basis of extremely large grain shape, QTL analysis was performed using an F(2) population derived from a cross between a japonica cultivar 'JZ1560' (extremely large grain) and a contrasting indica cultivar 'FAZ1' (small grain). A total number of 24 QTLs were detected on seven different chromosomes. QTLs for GL, GW, GT and LWR explained 11.6%, 95.62%, 91.5% and 89.9% of total phenotypic variation, respectively. Many QTLs pleiotropically controlled different grain traits, contributing complex traits correlation. GW2 and qSW5/GW5, which have been cloned previously to control GW, showed similar chromosomal locations with qGW2-1/qGT2-1/qLWR2-2 and qGW5-2/qLWR5-1 and should be the right candidate genes. Plants pyramiding GW2 and qSW5/GW5 showed a significant increase in GW compared with those carrying one of the two major QTLs. Furthermore, no significant QTL interaction was observed between GW2 and qSW5/GW5. These results suggested that GW2 and qSW5/GW5 might work in independent pathways to regulate grain traits. 'JZ1560' alleles underlying all QTLs contributed an increase in GW and GT and the accumulation of additive effects generates the extremely large grain shape in 'JZ1560'.
22747551	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria.	2012	Plant J	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in the modification of organelle transcripts. In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family. A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development. The photosynthetic rate in the mpr25 mutant was significantly decreased, especially under strong light conditions, although the respiration rate did not differ from that of wild-type plants. MPR25 was preferentially expressed in leaves. FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts. Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. RNA editing of this site is responsible for a change in amino acid from serine to leucine. Recombinant MPR25 directly interacted with the proximal region of the editing site of nad5 transcripts. However, the NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was not affected in the mutant. By contrast, genes encoding alternative NADH dehydrogenases and alternative oxidase were up-regulated. The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts.
22773759	The rice monovalent cation transporter OsHKT2;4: revisited ionic selectivity.	2012	Plant Physiol	The family of plant membrane transporters named HKT (for high-affinity K(+) transporters) can be subdivided into subfamilies 1 and 2, which, respectively, comprise Na(+)-selective transporters and transporters able to function as Na(+)-K(+) symporters, at least when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or Xenopus oocytes. Surprisingly, a subfamily 2 member from rice (Oryza sativa), OsHKT2;4, has been proposed to form cation/K(+) channels or transporters permeable to Ca(2+) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Here, OsHKT2;4 functional properties were reassessed in Xenopus oocytes. A Ca(2+) permeability through OsHKT2;4 was not detected, even at very low external K(+) concentration, as shown by highly negative OsHKT2;4 zero-current potential in high Ca(2+) conditions and lack of sensitivity of OsHKT2;4 zero-current potential and conductance to external Ca(2+). The Ca(2+) permeability previously attributed to OsHKT2;4 probably resulted from activation of an endogenous oocyte conductance. OsHKT2;4 displayed a high permeability to K(+) compared with that to Na(+) (permeability sequence: K(+) > Rb(+) ≈ Cs(+) > Na(+) ≈ Li(+) ≈ NH(4)(+)). Examination of OsHKT2;4 current sensitivity to external pH suggested that H(+) is not significantly permeant through OsHKT2;4 in most physiological ionic conditions. Further analyses in media containing both Na(+) and K(+) indicated that OsHKT2;4 functions as K(+)-selective transporter at low external Na(+), but transports also Na(+) at high (>10 mm) Na(+) concentrations. These data identify OsHKT2;4 as a new functional type in the K(+) and Na(+)-permeable HKT transporter subfamily. Furthermore, the high permeability to K(+) in OsHKT2;4 supports the hypothesis that this system is dedicated to K(+) transport in the plant.
22892331	The same oleosin isoforms are present in oil bodies of rice embryo and aleurone layer while caleosin exists only in those of the embryo.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Oil bodies of similar sizes were observed in the cells of embryo and aleurone layer of rice seeds, and remained their structural integrity in vitro after isolation. Comparably, two abundant oleosin isoforms were found in both preparations of oil bodies isolated from the embryo and the aleurone layer. Immunological detection and mass spectrometric analyses indicated that the two oleosin isoforms, termed oleosin-H and oleosin-L, in the embryo and those in the aleurone layer were identical proteins encoded by the same genes (BAF12898.1 and BAF15387.1 for oleosin-H and oleosin-L, respectively). In contrast, one caleosin was found in oil bodies isolated from the embryo but not those isolated from the aleurone layer. Immunological staining of rice seeds confirms that oleosin is present in both embryo and aleurone layer while caleosin exists only in embryo. Caleosin extracted from oil bodies of rice embryo migrated faster on SDS-PAGE in the presence of Ca(2+), in a manner identical to caleosin extracted from sesame oil bodies. Similar to other known monocot caleosins, the rice caleosin possesses an N-terminal appendix that is absent in dicotyledonous caleosins.
22730086	Proteomic analysis of salt-responsive ubiquitin-related proteins in rice roots.	2012	Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom	RATIONALE: Ubiquitination of proteins plays an important role in regulating a myriad of physiological functions in plants such as xylogenesis, senescence, cell cycle control, and stress response. However, only a limited number of proteins in plants have been identified as being ubiquitinated in response to salt stress. The relationships between ubiquitination and salt-stress responses in plants are not clear.

METHODS: Rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings from the same genetic background with various salt tolerances exposed to salt stress were studied. The proteins of roots were extracted then analyzed using western blotting against ubiquitin. Differentially expressed ubiquitinated proteins were identified by nanospray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC/MS/MS) and quantified by label-free methods based on the Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) and on the peak areas of XIC spectra derived from ubiquitinated peptides. In addition, we performed a gel-based shotgun proteomic analysis to detect the ubiquitinated proteome that may be involved in response to salt stress.

RESULTS: The expressions of ubiquitination on pyruvate phosphate dikinase 1, heat shock protein 81-1, probable aldehyde oxidase 3, plasma membrane ATPase, cellulose synthase A catalytic subunit 4 [UDP-forming] and cyclin-C1-1 were identified and compared before and after salt treatment. The functions of those ubiquitinated proteins were further discussed for defence against salt stress. In addition, a large number of ubiquitinated proteins were successfully identified as well in this study.

CONCLUSIONS: The ubiquitination of proteins affected the protective mechanisms in rice seedlings to resist the salt stress during the initial phase. The findings in the present study also demonstrate that the regulated mechanisms through protein ubiquitination are important for rice seedlings against salt stress.
22884095	Characterization and fine mapping of a novel rice albino mutant low temperature albino 1.	2012	J Genet Genomics	Albino mutants are useful genetic resource for studying chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development and cloning genes involved in these processes in plants. Here we report a novel rice mutant low temperature albino 1 (lta1) that showed albino leaves before 4-leaf stage when grown under temperature lower than 20°C, but developed normal green leaves under temperature higher than 24°C or similar morphological phenotypes in dark as did the wild-type (WT). Our analysis showed that the contents of chlorophylls and chlorophyll precursors were remarkably decreased in the lta1 mutant under low temperature compared to WT. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that chloroplasts were defectively developed in the albino lta1 leaves, which lacked of well-stacked granum and contained less stroma lamellae. These results suggested that the lta1 mutation may delay the light-induced thylakoid assembly under low temperature. Genetic analysis indicated that the albino phenotype was controlled by a single recessive locus. Through map-based approach, we finally located the Lta1 gene to a region of 40.3 kb on the short arm of chromosome 11. There are 8 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in this region and two of them were deleted in lta1 genome compared with the WT genome. The further characterization of the Lta1 gene would provide a good approach to uncover the novel molecular mechanisms involved in chloroplast development under low temperature stress.
22882653	Recombinant protein yield in rice seed is enhanced by specific suppression of endogenous seed proteins at the same deposit site.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	Human IL-10 (hIL-10) is a therapeutic treatment candidate for inflammatory allergy and autoimmune diseases. Rice seed-produced IL-10 can be effectively delivered directly to gut-associated lymphoreticular tissue (GALT) via bio-encapsulation. Previously, the codon-optimized hIL-10 gene was expressed in transgenic rice with the signal peptide and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (KDEL) at its 5' and 3' ends, respectively, under the control of the endosperm-specific glutelin GluB-1 promoter. The resulting purified hIL-10 was biologically active. In this study, the yield of hIL-10 in transgenic rice seed was improved. This protein accumulated at the intended deposition sites, which had been made vacant through the selective reduction, via RNA interference, of the endogenous seed storage proteins prolamins or glutelins. Upon suppression of prolamins that were sequestered into ER-derived protein bodies (PB-I), hIL-10 accumulation increased approximately 3-fold as compared to rice seed with no such suppression and reached 219 μg/grain. In contrast, reducing the majority of the glutelins stored in protein-storage vacuoles (PB-II) did not significantly affect the accumulation of hIL-10. Considering that hIL-10 is synthesized in the ER lumen and subsequently buds off in ER-derived granules called IL-10 granules in a manner similar to PB-Is, these results indicate that increases in the available deposition space for the desired recombinant proteins may be crucial for improvements in yield. Furthermore, efficient dimeric intermolecular formation of hIL-10 by inhibiting interaction with Cys-rich prolamins also contributed to the enhanced formation of IL-10 bodies. Higher yield of hIL-10 produced in rice seeds is expected to have broad application in the future.
22869603	OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice.	2012	Mol Plant	Ca(2+) and calmodulin (CaM) have been shown to play an important role in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defense. However, it is unknown whether Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is involved in the process. In the present study, the role of rice CCaMK, OsDMI3, in ABA-induced antioxidant defense was investigated in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) plants. Treatments with ABA, H(2)O(2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsDMI3 and the activity of OsDMI3, and H(2)O(2) is required for the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 under water stress. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsDMI3 is located in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the plasma membrane. The analysis of the transient expression of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts and the RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts showed that OsDMI3 is required for ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Further, the oxidative damage induced by higher concentrations of PEG and H(2)O(2) was aggravated in the mutant of OsDMI3. Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of OsDMI3 in protoplasts and the mutant of OsDMI3 showed that higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation require OsDMI3 activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H(2)O(2) production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of OsDMI3 in leaves of rice plants. Our data reveal that OsDMI3 is an important component in ABA-induced antioxidant defense in rice.
22906634	Rice protein improves oxidative stress by regulating glutathione metabolism and attenuating oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in rats.	2012	Life Sci	AIMS: To evaluate the effects of rice protein (RP) on glutathione metabolism and oxidative damage.

MAIN METHODS: Seven-week-old male Wistar rats were fed diets containing casein and RP without cholesterol for 3weeks. Plasma and liver lipid levels, hepatic accumulation of total glutathione (T-GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) were measured. In the liver, the total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), mRNA levels of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM), and the activities of hepatic catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were also measured.

KEY FINDINGS: T-AOC, GCLC and GCLM mRNA levels, antioxidative enzyme activities (T-SOD and CAT) and glutathione metabolism related enzyme activities (γ-GCS, GST, GR and GSHPx) were effectively stimulated by RP feeding compared to casein, and RP significantly reduced the hepatic accumulation of MDA and PCO in rats. These results indicate that lipid-lowering activity was induced by RP feeding.

SIGNIFICANCE: The present study demonstrates that RP improves oxidative stress primarily through enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative defense mechanisms, reflected by enhancing the antioxidative status and attenuating the oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. These results suggest that RP can prevent hyperlipidemia in part through modifying glutathione metabolism, and sulfur amino acids may be the main modulator of this antioxidative mechanism.
22876968	QTL analysis of novel genomic regions associated with yield and yield related traits in new plant type based recombinant inbred lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Rice is staple food for more than half of the world's population including two billion Asians, who obtain 60-70% of their energy intake from rice and its derivatives. To meet the growing demand from human population, rice varieties with higher yield potential and greater yield stability need to be developed. The favourable alleles for yield and yield contributing traits are distributed among two subspecies i.e., indica and japonica of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). Identification of novel favourable alleles in indica/japonica will pave way to marker-assisted mobilization of these alleles in to a genetic background to break genetic barriers to yield.

RESULTS: A new plant type (NPT) based mapping population of 310 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to map novel genomic regions and QTL hotspots influencing yield and eleven yield component traits. We identified major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for days to 50% flowering (R2 = 25%, LOD = 14.3), panicles per plant (R2 = 19%, LOD = 9.74), flag leaf length (R2 = 22%, LOD = 3.05), flag leaf width (R2 = 53%, LOD = 46.5), spikelets per panicle (R2 = 16%, LOD = 13.8), filled grains per panicle (R2 = 22%, LOD = 15.3), percent spikelet sterility (R2 = 18%, LOD = 14.24), thousand grain weight (R2 = 25%, LOD = 12.9) and spikelet setting density (R2 = 23%, LOD = 15) expressing over two or more locations by using composite interval mapping. The phenotypic variation (R2) ranged from 8 to 53% for eleven QTLs expressing across all three locations. 19 novel QTLs were contributed by the NPT parent, Pusa1266. 15 QTL hotpots on eight chromosomes were identified for the correlated traits. Six epistatic QTLs effecting five traits at two locations were identified. A marker interval (RM3276-RM5709) on chromosome 4 harboring major QTLs for four traits was identified.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that favourable alleles for yield and yield contributing traits were distributed among two subspecies of rice and QTLs were co-localized in different genomic regions. QTL hotspots will be useful for understanding the common genetic control mechanism of the co-localized traits and selection for beneficial allele at these loci will result in a cumulative increase in yield due to the integrative positive effect of various QTLs. The information generated in the present study will be useful to fine map and to identify the genes underlying major robust QTLs and to transfer all favourable QTLs to one genetic background to break genetic barriers to yield for sustained food security.
22903596	Crystal structures of rice (Oryza sativa) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexes with NAD and sulfate suggest involvement of Phe37 in NAD binding for catalysis.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Cytosolic Oryza sativa glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPDH), the enzyme involved in the ubiquitous glycolysis, catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (BPG) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as an electron acceptor. We report crystal structures of OsGAPDH in three conditions of NAD-free, NAD-bound and sulfate-soaked forms to discuss the molecular determinants for coenzyme specificity. The structure of OsGAPDH showed a homotetramer form with each monomer comprising three domains-NAD-binding, catalytic and S-loop domains. NAD binds to each OsGAPDH subunits with some residues forming positively charged grooves that attract sulfate anions, as a simulation of phosphate groups in the product BPG. Phe37 not only forms a bottleneck to improve NAD-binding but also combines with Pro193 and Asp35 as key conserved residues for NAD-specificity in OsGAPDH. The binding of NAD alters the side-chain conformation of Phe37 with a 90° rotation related to the adenine moiety of NAD, concomitant with clamping the active site about 0.6 Å from the "open" to "closed" form, producing an increased affinity specific for NAD. Phe37 exists only in higher organisms, whereas it is replaced by other residues (Thr or Leu) with smaller side chains in lower organisms, which makes a greater distance between Leu34 and NAD of E. coli GAPDH than that between Phe37 and NAD of OsGAPDH. We demonstrated that Phe37 plays a crucial role in stabilizing NAD binding or intermediating of apo-holo transition, resulting in a greater NAD-dependent catalytic efficiency using site-directed mutagenesis. Phe37 might be introduced by evolution generating a catalytic advantage in cytosolic GAPDH.
22917912	[Morphological characteristics and gene mapping of a palea degradation(pd2) mutant in rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	The yield and quality of rice are directly impacted by floral organ development in rice. Understanding of the floral development mechanism will be useful in genetic improvement of yield and quality. In this study, a rice mutant palea degradation 2 (pd2) in an indica cultivar '8PW33' was obtained after 60Co γ-ray treatment. Analysis of the mutant showed that, compared to the wild type, plant height, total grain number per panicle, and sword leaf width were significantly increased, but the seed setting rate were significantly decreased. The florets of the mutant exhibited degraded palea and sickle-shaped tortuous lemma. Detail examination using scanning electron microscopy revealed that when epidermis of the vane and lemma were normal, epidermis of the palea were arranged tightly, which might result from degraded palea. Genetic analysis supported that this mutation phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene. Polymorphic analysis of simple sequence repeat markers demonstrated that PD2 gene is located on chromosome 9. With a larger mapping population and more indel markers, we further mapped PD2 gene between 2 indel markers with a physical region of about 82 kb. Within this region, there is a cloned gene REP1 known to control rice palea development. By comparing the DNA sequences of REP1 from pd2 and 8PW33, in combination with the results of phenotypic analysis, we concluded that PD2 is an allele of REP1.
22794919	Lack of starch synthase IIIa and high expression of granule-bound starch synthase I synergistically increase the apparent amylose content in rice endosperm.	2012	Plant Sci	Rice endosperm starch is composed of 0-30% linear amylose, which is entirely synthesized by granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI: encoded by Waxy, Wx). The remainder consists of branched amylopectin and is elongated by multiple starch synthases (SS) including SSI, IIa and IIIa. Typical japonica rice lacks active SSIIa and contains a low expressing Wx(b) causing a low amylose content (ca. 20%). WAB2-3 (SS3a/Wx(a)) lines generated by the introduction of a dominant indica Wx(a) into a japonica waxy mutant (SS3a/wx) exhibit elevated GBSSI and amylose content (ca. 25%). The japonica ss3a mutant (ss3a/Wx(b)) shows a high amylose content (ca. 30%), decreased long chains of amylopectin and increased GBSSI levels. To investigate the functional relationship between the ss3a and Wx(a) genes, the ss3a/Wx(a) line was generated by crossing ss3a/Wx(b) with SS3a/Wx(a), and the starch properties of this line were examined. The results show that the apparent amylose content of the ss3a/Wx(a) line was increased (41.3%) compared to the parental lines. However, the GBSSI quantity did not increase compared to the SS3a/Wx(a) line. The amylopectin branch structures were similar to the ss3a/Wx(b) mutant. Therefore, Wx(a) and ss3a synergistically increase the apparent amylose content in rice endosperm, and the possible reasons for this increase are discussed.
22585748	Quantifying ATP turnover in anoxic coleoptiles of rice (Oryza sativa) demonstrates preferential allocation of energy to protein synthesis.	2012	J Exp Bot	Oxygen deprivation limits the energy available for cellular processes and yet no comprehensive ATP budget has been reported for any plant species under O(2) deprivation, including Oryza sativa. Using 3-d-old coleoptiles of a cultivar of O. sativa tolerant to flooding at germination, (i) rates of ATP regeneration in coleoptiles grown under normoxia (aerated solution), hypoxia (3% O(2)), and anoxia (N(2)) and (ii) rates of synthesis of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and cell walls, as well as K(+) transport, were determined. Based on published bioenergetics data, the cost of synthesizing each class of polymer and the proportion of available ATP allocated to each process were then compared. Protein synthesis consumed the largest proportion of ATP synthesized under all three oxygen regimes, with the proportion of ATP allocated to protein synthesis in anoxia (52%) more than double that in normoxic coleoptiles (19%). Energy allocation to cell wall synthesis was undiminished in hypoxia, consistent with preferential elongation typical of submerged coleoptiles. Lipid synthesis was also conserved strongly in O(2) deficits, suggesting that membrane integrity was maintained under anoxia, thus allowing K(+) to be retained within coleoptile cells. Rates of protein synthesis in coleoptiles from rice cultivars with contrasting tolerance to oxygen deficits (including mutants deficient in fermentative enzymes) confirmed that synthesis and turnover of proteins always accounted for most of the ATP consumed under anoxia. It is concluded that successful establishment of rice seedlings under water is largely due to the capacity of coleoptiles to allocate energy to vital processes, particularly protein synthesis.
22798060	Constitutive expression of rice WRKY30 gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid accumulation, PR gene expression and resistance to fungal pathogens in rice.	2012	Planta	WRKY transcription factors are crucial regulatory components of plant responses to pathogen infection. In the present study, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice WRKY30 gene, whose transcripts accumulate rapidly in response to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Overexpression of WRKY30 in rice enhanced resistance to rice sheath blight fungus Rhizoctonia solani and blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines overexpressing WRKY30 was associated with activated expression of JA synthesis-related genes LOX, AOS2 and pathogenesis-related (PR)3 and PR10, and increased endogenous JA accumulation under the challenge of fungal pathogens. WRKY30 was nuclear-localized and had transcriptional activation ability in yeast cells, supporting that it functions as a transcription factor. Together, our findings indicate that JA plays a crucial role in the WRKY30-mediated defense responses to fungal pathogens, and that the rice WRKY30 seems promising as an important candidate gene to improve disease resistance in rice.
22811433	Availability of Rubisco small subunit up-regulates the transcript levels of large subunit for stoichiometric assembly of its holoenzyme in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	Rubisco is composed of eight small subunits coded for by the nuclear RBCS multigene family and eight large subunits coded for by the rbcL gene in the plastome. For synthesis of the Rubisco holoenzyme, both genes need to be expressed coordinately. To investigate this molecular mechanism, the protein synthesis of two subunits of Rubisco was characterized in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants with overexpression or antisense suppression of the RBCS gene. Total RBCS and rbcL messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and RBCS and RbcL synthesis simultaneously increased in RBCS-sense plants, although the increase in total RBCS mRNA level was greater. In RBCS-antisense plants, the levels of these mRNAs and the synthesis of the corresponding proteins declined to a similar extent. The amount of RBCS synthesized was tightly correlated with rbcL mRNA level among genotypes but not associated with changes in mRNA levels of other major chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic genes. The level of rbcL mRNA, in turn, was tightly correlated with the amount of RbcL synthesized, the molar ratio of RBCS synthesis to RbcL synthesis being identical irrespective of genotype. Polysome loading of rbcL mRNA was not changed. These results demonstrate that the availability of RBCS protein up-regulates the gene expression of rbcL primarily at the transcript level in a quantitative manner for stoichiometric assembly of Rubisco holoenzyme.
22827940	Pea DNA helicase 45 promotes salinity stress tolerance in IR64 rice with improved yield.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The helicases provide duplex unwinding function in an ATP-dependent manner and thereby play important role in almost all the nucleic acids transaction. Since stress reduces the protein synthesis by affecting the cellular gene expression machinery, so it is evident that molecules involved in nucleic acid processing including translation factors/helicases are likely to be affected. Earlier pea DNA helicase 45 (PDH45), a homolog of translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) was reported to play important role in salinity stress tolerance in tobacco and Bangladeshi rice variety Binnatoa. We report here the overexpression of PDH45 gene in the indica rice variety IR64, via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Molecular analysis of the transgenics revealed stable integration of the transgene in the T1 generation. Enhanced tolerance to salinity was observed in the plants transformed with PDH45 gene. Better physiological and yield performances including endogenous nutrient contents (N, P, K, Na) of the transgenics under salt treatment were observed as compared with wild type (WT), vector control and antisense transgenics. All these results indicated that the overexpression of PDH45 in the IR64 rice transgenics enable them to perform better with enhanced salinity stress tolerance and improved physiological traits. Based on the homology of PDH45 protein with eIF4A protein we suggest that it may act at the translational level to enhance or stabilize protein synthesis under stress conditions.
22829206	RNAi knockdown of rice SE5 gene is sensitive to the herbicide methyl viologen by the down-regulation of antioxidant defense.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Plant heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the oxygenation of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron (Fe(2+))-and Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) HOs are involved in light signaling. Here, we identified that the rice PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (SE5) gene, which encoded a putative HO with high similarity to HO-1 from Arabidopsis (HY1), exhibited HO activity, and localized in the chloroplasts. Rice RNAi mutants silenced for SE5 were generated and displayed early flowering under long-day conditions, consistent with phenotypes of the null mutation in SE5 gene reported previously (se5 and s73). The herbicide methyl viologen (MV), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), was applied to determine whether SE5 regulates oxidative stress response. Compared with wild-type, SE5 RNAi transgenic plants aggravated seedling growth inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, and decreased the transcripts of some representative antioxidative genes. By contrast, administration of exogenous CO partially rescued corresponding MV hypersensitivity in the SE5 RNAi plants. Alleviation of seed germination inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, as well as the induction of antioxidant defense were further observed when SE5 or HY1 was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that SE5 may be useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to oxidative stress.
22846333	Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Brassinosteroids are biosynthesized from campesterol via several cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed oxidative reactions. We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: CYP90D2 and CYP90D3. A rice dwarf mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), which contains a defective copy of CYP90D2, is known to be a brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, and CYP90D2 has been considered to act as a C-3 dehydrogenase. However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies. Both enzymes preferentially convert (22S,24R)-22-hydroxyergost-4-en-3-one, (22S,24R)-22-hydroxy-5α-ergostan-3-one, and 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone to the corresponding 23-hydroxylated products, but are less active in the conversion of (22S)-22-hydroxycampesterol and 6-deoxocathasterone, in vitro. Consistently, the levels of 23-hydroxylated products of these intermediates, namely, 6-deoxoteasterone, 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone, and 6-deoxotyphasterol were decreased in d2 mutants. These results indicate that CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice.
22848448	Genetic transformation and analysis of rice OsAPx2 gene in Medicago sativa.	2012	PLoS One	The OsAPx2 gene from rice was cloned to produce PBI121::OsAPx2 dual-expression plants, of which expression level would be increasing under stressful conditions. The enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in the leaves and roots of the plants increased with increasing exposure time to different sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))concentrations, as indicated by protein gel blot analysis. The increased enzyme yield improved the ability of the plants to resist the stress treatments. The OsAPx2 gene was localized in the cytoplasm of epidermal onion cells as indicated by the instantaneous expression of green fluorescence. An 80% regeneration rate was observed in Medicago sativa L. plants transformed with the OsAPx2 gene using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as indicated by specific primer PCR. The OsAPx2 gene was expressed at the mRNA level and the individual M. sativa (T#1,T#2,T#5) were obtained through assaying the generation of positive T2 using RNA gel blot analysis. When the seeds of the wild type (WT) and the T2 (T#1,T#5) were incubated in culture containing MS with NaCl for 7 days, the results as shown of following: the root length of transgenic plant was longer than WT plants, the H(2)O(2) content in roots of WT was more than of transgenic plants, the APX activity under stresses increased by 2.89 times compared with the WT, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the WT was higher than the transgenic plants, the leaves of the WT turned yellow, but those of the transgenic plants remained green and remained healthy. The chlorophyll content in the WT leaves was less than in the transgenic plants, after soaking in solutions of H(2)O(2), sodium sulfite (Na(2)SO(3)), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)). Therefore, the OsAPx2 gene overexpression in transgenic M. sativa improves the removal of H(2)O(2) and the salt-resistance compared with WT plants. A novel strain of M. sativa carrying a salt-resistance gene was obtained.
22771800	Crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in complex with maltopentaose.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Starch branching enzyme (SBE) catalyzes the cleavage of α-1,4-linkages and the subsequent transfer of α-1,4 glucan to form an α-1,6 branch point in amylopectin. We determined the crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in complex with maltopentaose at a resolution of 2.2Å. Maltopentaose bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminal helix, carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48), and α-amylase domain. In addition, glucose moieties could be observed at molecular surfaces on the N-terminal helix (α2) and CBM48. Amino acid residues involved in the carbohydrate bindings are highly conserved in other SBEs, suggesting their generally conserved role in substrate binding for SBEs.
22646149	Phylogeography of Asian wild rice, Oryza rufipogon: a genome-wide view.	2012	Mol Ecol	Asian wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that ranges widely across the eastern and southern part of Asia is recognized as the direct ancestor of cultivated Asian rice (O. sativa). Studies of the geographic structure of O. rufipogon, based on chloroplast and low-copy nuclear markers, reveal a possible phylogeographic signal of subdivision in O. rufipogon. However, this signal of geographic differentiation is not consistently observed among different markers and studies, with often conflicting results. To more precisely characterize the phylogeography of O. rufipogon populations, a genome-wide survey of unlinked markers, intensively sampled from across the entire range of O. rufipogon is critical. In this study, we surveyed sequence variation at 42 genome-wide sequence tagged sites (STS) in 108 O. rufipogon accessions from throughout the native range of the species. Using Bayesian clustering, principal component analysis and amova, we conclude that there are two genetically distinct O. rufipogon groups, Ruf-I and Ruf-II. The two groups exhibit a clinal variation pattern generally from north-east to south-west. Different from many earlier studies, Ruf-I, which is found mainly in China and the Indochinese Peninsula, shows genetic similarity with one major cultivated rice variety, O. satvia indica, whereas Ruf-II, mainly from South Asia and the Indochinese Peninsula, is not found to be closely related to cultivated rice varieties. The other major cultivated rice variety, O. sativa japonica, is not found to be similar to either O. rufipogon groups. Our results support the hypothesis of a single origin of the domesticated O. sativa in China. The possible role of palaeoclimate, introgression and migration-drift balance in creating this clinal variation pattern is also discussed.
22570632	Principles of carbon catabolite repression in the rice blast fungus: Tps1, Nmr1-3, and a MATE-family pump regulate glucose metabolism during infection.	2012	PLoS Genet	Understanding the genetic pathways that regulate how pathogenic fungi respond to their environment is paramount to developing effective mitigation strategies against disease. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a global regulatory mechanism found in a wide range of microbial organisms that ensures the preferential utilization of glucose over less favourable carbon sources, but little is known about the components of CCR in filamentous fungi. Here we report three new mediators of CCR in the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae: the sugar sensor Tps1, the Nmr1-3 inhibitor proteins, and the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-family pump, Mdt1. Using simple plate tests coupled with transcriptional analysis, we show that Tps1, in response to glucose-6-phosphate sensing, triggers CCR via the inactivation of Nmr1-3. In addition, by dissecting the CCR pathway using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated mutagenesis, we also show that Mdt1 is an additional and previously unknown regulator of glucose metabolism. Mdt1 regulates glucose assimilation downstream of Tps1 and is necessary for nutrient utilization, sporulation, and pathogenicity. This is the first functional characterization of a MATE-family protein in filamentous fungi and the first description of a MATE protein in genetic regulation or plant pathogenicity. Perturbing CCR in Δtps1 and MDT1 disruption strains thus results in physiological defects that impact pathogenesis, possibly through the early expression of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Taken together, the importance of discovering three new regulators of carbon metabolism lies in understanding how M. oryzae and other pathogenic fungi respond to nutrient availability and control development during infection.
22614271	Single- and double-SSR primer combined analyses in rice.	2012	Genet Mol Res	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the foundation of SSR molecular marker technology. We used sib rice varieties J518, XD1 and SD23 as experimental materials, selecting 30 pairs of SSR primers, including RM127, RM337 and RM5172, covering the rice genome, and performed single- and double-SSR primer combined analyses. We found that under the same PCR system and conditions, a single primer of the SSR primer pairs could amplify the same fragments as double primers do. The sequencing results demonstrated that some amplified fragments that we previously believed to come from double primers were actually produced by a single primer. The use of this kind of primer, such as the RM127 primer pair, for marker-assisted breeding will therefore be misleading. Additionally, using the same PCR system and conditions, some single primers that are part of SSR primer pairs can amplify many more specific fragments than double-SSR primers. For instance, in the case of the RM5172 primer pair, a single primer P1 amplified approximately three times the number of fragments as the double primer. This information can contribute to research on genetic diversity of species, understanding of genetic relationships and identification of germplasm resources. Accordingly, combined analyses of single- and double-primer amplification products not only can remove single-primer amplification fragments and false-positives from double-primer amplification products in order to improve test accuracy, but also can facilitate research on genetic diversity, exploration of phylogenetic relationships and identification of germplasm resources. We define this method as "single- and double-SSR primer combined analyses".
22659434	[Mapping of Sanming dominant genic male sterility gene in rice].	2012	Yi Chuan	The mutant of "Sanming Dominant Genic Male Sterile Rice" was found from an F2 population of cross "SE2lS/Basmati370" by Sanming Institute of Agricultural Science in 2001. It has proven that the male sterility of this mutant is controlled by a dominant gene (named as SMS). By multiple backcrosses, this dominant male sterile allele was introduced into the genetic background of an indica rice cultivar Jiafuzhan (which was known as Jiabuyu). In order to map SMS, a mapping population was constructed by crossing Jiabuyu with a japonica cultivar Nipponbare and further crossing the F1 with Jiafuzhan. By bulked segregant analysis and linkage analysis using SSR and INDEL markers, SMS was mapped to a 99 kb interval between INDEL markers ZM30 and ZM9 on chromosome 8. This result will facilitate cloning of SMS.
22610311	Backbone and sidechain (1)H, (13)C and (15)N chemical shift assignments of the hydrophobin MPG1 from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	Biomol NMR Assign	Fungal hydrophobins are secreted proteins that self-assemble at hydrophobic:hydrophilic interfaces. They are essential for a variety of processes in the fungal life cycle, including mediating interactions with surfaces and infection of hosts. The fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast, relies on the unique properties of hydrophobins to infect cultivated rice as well as over 50 different grass species. The hydrophobin MPG1 is highly expressed during rice blast pathogenesis and has been implicated during host infection. Here we report the backbone and sidechain assignments for the class I hydrophobin MPG1 from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
22696296	Maize multiple archesporial cells 1 (mac1), an ortholog of rice TDL1A, modulates cell proliferation and identity in early anther development.	2012	Development	To ensure fertility, complex somatic and germinal cell proliferation and differentiation programs must be executed in flowers. Loss-of-function of the maize multiple archesporial cells 1 (mac1) gene increases the meiotically competent population and ablates specification of somatic wall layers in anthers. We report the cloning of mac1, which is the ortholog of rice TDL1A. Contrary to prior studies in rice and Arabidopsis in which mac1-like genes were inferred to act late to suppress trans-differentiation of somatic tapetal cells into meiocytes, we find that mac1 anthers contain excess archesporial (AR) cells that proliferate at least twofold more rapidly than normal prior to tapetal specification, suggesting that MAC1 regulates cell proliferation. mac1 transcript is abundant in immature anthers and roots. By immunolocalization, MAC1 protein accumulates preferentially in AR cells with a declining radial gradient that could result from diffusion. By transient expression in onion epidermis, we demonstrate experimentally that MAC1 is secreted, confirming that the predicted signal peptide domain in MAC1 leads to secretion. Insights from cytology and double-mutant studies with ameiotic1 and absence of first division1 mutants confirm that MAC1 does not affect meiotic cell fate; it also operates independently of an epidermal, Ocl4-dependent pathway that regulates proliferation of subepidermal cells. MAC1 both suppresses excess AR proliferation and is responsible for triggering periclinal division of subepidermal cells. We discuss how MAC1 can coordinate the temporal and spatial pattern of cell proliferation in maize anthers.
22713349	Effect of acid and base catalyzed hydrolysis on the yield of phenolics and antioxidant activity of extracts from germinated brown rice (GBR).	2012	Molecules	The influence of both acidic and basic hydrolysis on the yield, total phenolic content and antioxidative capacity of methanolic extract of germinated brown rice (GBR) was studied. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical cation scavenging, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) tests were used for the measurement of antioxidant ability. There was a significant difference p < 0.05) in the TPC and DPPH radical scavenging assay results when comparing neutral with acidic and basic catalysed hydrolysis. The yield of the crude extract was slightly higher in acidic hydrolysis than in basic hydrolysis p > 0.05). The TPC and TFC were highest in acidic hydrolysis. A significant correlation was observed between ABTS radical cation scavenging and FRAP. The antioxidant activity measured using DPPH radical scavenging assay showed high activity in acidic hydrolysis, while the ABTS radical cationscavenging activity and FRAP showed the highest values in basic hydrolysis. The samples were further evaluated using HPLC to determine the individual phenolic concentrations in different hydrolytic media contributing to the antioxidant effects. This study revealed that acidic and basic hydrolysis can improve the yield, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of germinated brown rice.
22815975	Limited fitness advantages of crop-weed hybrid progeny containing insect-resistant transgenes (Bt/CpTI) in transgenic rice field.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The spread of insect-resistance transgenes from genetically engineered (GE) rice to its coexisting weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea) populations via gene flow creates a major concern for commercial GE rice cultivation. Transgene flow to weedy rice seems unavoidable. Therefore, characterization of potential fitness effect brought by the transgenes is essential to assess environmental consequences caused by crop-weed transgene flow.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Field performance of fitness-related traits was assessed in advanced hybrid progeny of F(4) generation derived from a cross between an insect-resistant transgenic (Bt/CpTI) rice line and a weedy strain. The performance of transgene-positive hybrid progeny was compared with the transgene-negative progeny and weedy parent in pure and mixed planting of transgenic and nontransgenic plants under environmental conditions with natural vs. low insect pressure. Results showed that under natural insect pressure the insect-resistant transgenes could effectively suppress target insects and bring significantly increased fitness to transgenic plants in pure planting, compared with nontransgenic plants (including weedy parent). In contrast, no significant differences in fitness were detected under low insect pressure. However, such increase in fitness was not detected in the mixed planting of transgenic and nontransgenic plants due to significantly reduced insect pressure.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Insect-resistance transgenes may have limited fitness advantages to hybrid progeny resulted from crop-weed transgene flow owning to the significantly reduced ambient target insect pressure when an insect-resistant GE crop is grown. Given that the extensive cultivation of an insect-resistant GE crop will ultimately reduce the target insect pressure, the rapid spread of insect-resistance transgenes in weedy populations in commercial GE crop fields may be not likely to happen.
22763462	Increased α-tocotrienol content in seeds of transgenic rice overexpressing Arabidopsis γ-tocopherol methyltransferase.	2013	Transgenic Res	Vitamin E comprises a group of eight lipid soluble antioxidant compounds that are an essential part of the human diet. The α-isomers of both tocopherol and tocotrienol are generally considered to have the highest antioxidant activities. γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT) catalyzes the final step in vitamin E biosynthesis, the methylation of γ- and δ-isomers to α- and β-isomers. In present study, the Arabidopsis γ-TMT (AtTMT) cDNA was overexpressed constitutively or in the endosperm of the elite japonica rice cultivar Wuyujing 3 (WY3) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. HPLC analysis showed that, in brown rice of the wild type or transgenic controls with empty vector, the α-/γ-tocotrienol ratio was only 0.7, much lower than that for tocopherol (~19.0). In transgenic rice overexpressing AtTMT driven by the constitutive Ubi promoter, most of the γ-isomers were converted to α-isomers, especially the γ- and δ-tocotrienol levels were dramatically decreased. As a result, the α-tocotrienol content was greatly increased in the transgenic seeds. Similarly, over-expression of AtTMT in the endosperm also resulted in an increase in the α-tocotrienol content. The results showed that the α-/γ-tocopherol ratio also increased in the transgenic seeds, but there was no significant effect on α-tocopherol level, which may reflect the fact that γ-tocopherol is present in very small amounts in wild type rice seeds. AtTMT overexpression had no effect on the absolute total content of either tocopherols or tocotrienols. Taken together, these results are the first demonstration that the overexpression of a foreign γ-TMT significantly shift the tocotrienol synthesis in rice, which is one of the world's most important food crops.
22786641	Characterization of a β-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor from the rice stem borer (Chilo suppressalis).	2012	J Exp Biol	Octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of adrenaline and noradrenaline, plays a key role in regulation of many physiological and behavioral processes in insects. It modulates these functions through binding to specific octopamine receptors, which are typical rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptors. A cDNA encoding a seven-transmembrane receptor was cloned from the nerve cord of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, viz. CsOA2B2, which shares high sequence similarity to CG6989, a Drosophila β-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor (DmOctβ2R). We generated an HEK-293 cell line that stably expresses CsOA2B2 in order to examine the functional and pharmacological properties of this receptor. Activation of CsOA2B2 by octopamine increased the production of cAMP in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50)=2.33 nmol l(-1)), with a maximum response at 100 nmol l(-1). Tyramine also activated the receptor but with much less potency than octopamine. Dopamine and serotonin had marginal effects on cAMP production. Using a series of known agonists and antagonists for octopamine receptors, we observed a rather unique pharmacological profile for CsOA2B2 through measurements of cAMP. The rank order of potency of the agonists was naphazoline > clonidine. The activated effect of octopamine is abolished by co-incubation with phentolamine, mianserin or chlorpromazine. Using in vivo pharmacology, CsOA2B2 antagonists mianserin and phentolamine impaired the motor ability of individual rice stem borers. The results of the present study are important for a better functional understanding of this receptor as well as for practical applications in the development of environmentally sustainable pesticides.
22791138	Expression of a rice chitinase gene in transgenic banana ('Gros Michel', AAA genome group) confers resistance to black leaf streak disease.	2013	Transgenic Res	Transgenic banana (Musa acuminata 'Gros Michel') integrating either of two rice chitinase genes was generated and its resistance to Black Leaf Streak disease caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis was tested using a leaf disk bioassay. PCR screening indicated the presence of the hpt selectable marker gene in more than 90 % of the lines tested, whereas more than three quarters of the lines contained the linked rice chitinase gene resulting in a co-transformation frequency of at least 71.4 %. Further, a unique stable integration of the transgenes in each line revealed some false negative PCR results and the expected co-transformation frequency of 100 %. The transgene insert number per line ranged from 1 to 5 and single transgene insert lines (25 % of all) were identified. Considerable delay in disease development (up to 63 days post-incoculation) over a monitoring period of 108 days occurred in nine lines with extracellularly targeted chitinase out of 17 transgenic lines tested and their necrotic leaf area decreased by 73-94 % compared to the untransformed susceptible control line. Finally, correlation between symptom development and rice chitinase expression was confirmed in two lines by Western analysis. The potential of rice chitinase genes to enhance resistance against M. fijiensis in banana was demonstrated as well as the usefulness of the leaf disk bioassay for early disease screening in transgenic banana lines.
22624059	Purification and characterization of a novel hypersensitive response-inducing elicitor from Magnaporthe oryzae that triggers defense response in rice.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, might secrete certain proteins related to plant-fungal pathogen interactions.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we report the purification, characterization, and gene cloning of a novel hypersensitive response-inducing protein elicitor (MoHrip1) secreted by M. oryzae. The protein fraction was purified and identified by de novo sequencing, and the sequence matched the genomic sequence of a putative protein from M. oryzae strain 70-15 (GenBank accession No. XP_366602.1). The elicitor-encoding gene mohrip1 was isolated; it consisted of a 429 bp cDNA, which encodes a polypeptide of 142 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14.322 kDa and a pI of 4.53. The deduced protein, MoHrip1, was expressed in E. coli. And the expression protein collected from bacterium also forms necrotic lesions in tobacco. MoHrip1 could induce the early events of the defense response, including hydrogen peroxide production, callose deposition, and alkalization of the extracellular medium, in tobacco. Moreover, MoHrip1-treated rice seedlings possessed significantly enhanced systemic resistance to M. oryzae compared to the control seedlings. The real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of some pathogenesis-related genes and genes involved in signal transduction could also be induced by MoHrip1.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate that MoHrip1 triggers defense responses in rice and could be used for controlling rice blast disease.
22738964	Suppressive effect of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3) on D-galactosamine-induced IL-18 expression and hepatitis in rats.	2012	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We investigated in this study the effect of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3) and its fractions on D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced IL-18 expression and hepatitis in rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with MGN-3 or fractions of the MGN-3 hydrolysate, or with saline 1 h before administering D-GalN (400 mg/kg B.W.). The serum transaminase activities, IL-18 mRNA expression level in the liver and IL-18 concentration in the serum were determined 24 h after injecting D-GalN. Both the oral and intraperitoneal administration of MGN-3 (20 mg/kg B.W.) alleviated D-GalN-induced hepatic injury under these experimental conditions. The low-molecular-weight fraction (LMW) of MGN-3 showed the strongest protective effect on D-GalN-induced liver injury, its main sugar component being glucose. Moreover, the D-GalN-induced IL-18 expression was significantly reduced by treating with MGN-3 and LMW. The results suggest that MGN-3 and LMW could provide significant protection against D-GalN liver injury, and that IL-18 might be involved in their protective influence.
22558413	Peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT1 is indispensable for appressorium function of the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	PLoS One	The role of β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle in fungal pathogenesis is well documented. However, an ambiguity still remains over their interaction in peroxisomes to facilitate fungal pathogenicity and virulence. In this report, we characterize a gene encoding an alanine, glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1) in Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease, and demonstrate that AGT1 is required for pathogenicity of M. oryzae. Targeted deletion of AGT1 resulted in the failure of penetration via appressoria; therefore, mutants lacking the gene were unable to induce blast symptoms on the hosts rice and barley. This penetration failure may be associated with a disruption in lipid mobilization during conidial germination as turgor generation in the appressorium requires mobilization of lipid reserves from the conidium. Analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression using the transcriptional and translational fusion with the AGT1 promoter and open reading frame, respectively, revealed that AGT1 expressed constitutively in all in vitro grown cell types and during in planta colonization, and localized in peroxisomes. Peroxisomal localization was further confirmed by colocalization with red fluorescent protein fused with the peroxisomal targeting signal 1. Surprisingly, conidia produced by the Δagt1 mutant were unable to form appressoria on artificial inductive surfaces, even after prolonged incubation. When supplemented with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))+pyruvate, appressorium formation was restored on an artificial inductive surface. Taken together, our data indicate that AGT1-dependent pyruvate formation by transferring an amino group of alanine to glyoxylate, an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle is required for lipid mobilization and utilization. This pyruvate can be converted to non-fermentable carbon sources, which may require reoxidation of NADH generated by the β-oxidation of fatty acids to NAD(+) in peroxisomes. Therefore, it may provide a means to maintain redox homeostasis in appressoria.
22666467	Exploring the midgut transcriptome and brush border membrane vesicle proteome of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker).	2012	PLoS One	The rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is one of the most detrimental pests affecting rice crops. The use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins has been explored as a means to control this pest, but the potential for C. suppressalis to develop resistance to Bt toxins makes this approach problematic. Few C. suppressalis gene sequences are known, which makes in-depth study of gene function difficult. Herein, we sequenced the midgut transcriptome of the rice stem borer. In total, 37,040 contigs were obtained, with a mean size of 497 bp. As expected, the transcripts of C. suppressalis shared high similarity with arthropod genes. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis were used to classify the gene functions in C. suppressalis. Using the midgut transcriptome data, we conducted a proteome analysis to identify proteins expressed abundantly in the brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Of the 100 top abundant proteins that were excised and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, 74 share high similarity with known proteins. Among these proteins, Western blot analysis showed that Aminopeptidase N and EH domain-containing protein have the binding activities with Bt-toxin Cry1Ac. These data provide invaluable information about the gene sequences of C. suppressalis and the proteins that bind with Cry1Ac.
22570148	Bacterial transposons are co-transferred with T-DNA to rice chromosomes during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.	2012	Mol Cells	Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely utilized for delivering a foreign gene into a plant's genome. We found the bacterial transposon Tn5393 in transgenic rice plants. Analysis of the flanking sequences of the transferred-DNA (T-DNA) identified that a portion of the Tn5393 sequence was present immediately next to the end of the T-DNA. Because this transposon was present in A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404, but not in EHA105 and GV3101, our findings indicated that Tn5393 was transferred from LBA4404 into the rice genome during the transformation process. We also noted that another bacterial transposon, Tn5563, is present in transgenic plants. Analyses of 331 transgenic lines revealed that 26.0% carried Tn5393 and 2.1% contained Tn5563. In most of the lines, an intact transposon was integrated into the T-DNA and transferred to the rice chromosome. More than one copy of T-DNA was introduced into the plants, often at a single locus. This resulted in T-DNA repeats of normal and transposon-carrying TDNA that generated deletions of a portion of the T-DNA, joining the T-DNA end to the bacterial transposon. Based on these data, we suggest that one should carefully select the appropriate Agrobacterium strain to avoid undesirable transformation of such sequences.
22514089	Activation and epigenetic regulation of DNA transposon nDart1 in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	A large part of the rice genome is composed of transposons. Since active excision/reintegration of these mobile elements may result in harmful genetic changes, many transposons are maintained in a genetically or epigenetically inactivated state. However, some non-autonomous DNA transposons of the nDart1-3 subgroup, including nDart1-0, actively transpose in specific rice lines, such as pyl-v which carries an active autonomous element, aDart1-27, on chromosome 6. Although nDart1-3 subgroup elements show considerable sequence identity, they display different excision frequencies. The most active element, nDart1-0, had a low cytosine methylation status. The aDart1-27 sequence showed conservation between pyl-stb (pyl-v derivative line) and Nipponbare, which both lack autonomous activity for transposition of nDart1-3 subgroup elements. In pyl-v plants, the promoter region of the aDart1-27 transposase gene was more hypomethylated than in other rice lines. Treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) induced transposition of nDart1-3 subgroup elements in both pyl-stb and Nipponbare plants; the new insertion sites were frequently located in genic regions. 5-AzaC treatment principally induced expression of Dart1-34 transposase rather than the other 38 aDart1-related elements in both pyl-stb and Nipponbare treatment groups. Our observations show that transposition of nDart1-3 subgroup elements in the nDart1/aDart1 tagging system is correlated with the level of DNA methylation. Our system does not cause somaclonal variation due to an absence of transformed plants, offers the possibility of large-scale screening in the field and can identify dominant mutants. We therefore propose that this tagging system provides a valuable addition to the tools available for rice functional genomics.
22567170	Molecular characterization of a ryanodine receptor gene in the rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée).	2012	PLoS One	Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the targets of two novel classes of synthetic insecticidal chemicals, phthalic acid diamides and anthranilic diamides. Isolation of full-length RyR cDNAs is a critical step towards the structural and functional characterization of insect RyRs and an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the species selective toxicity of diamide insecticides. However, there has been little research on the insect RyR genes due to the high molecular weight of the RyR proteins. In this study, we isolated a full-length RyR cDNA (named as CmRyR) from Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, an important rice pest throughout Southeast Asia. The composite CmRyR gene contains an ORF of 15264 bp encoding a protein of 5087 amino acid residues, which shares 79% overall identity with its Drosophila melanogaster homologue. All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in the CmRyR protein, suggesting that CmRyR is a structural and functional analogue of known RyRs. A multiple sequence alignment illustrates that the insect RyRs share high levels of amino acid sequence identity at the the COOH-terminal region. However, the amino acid residues analogous to the CmRyR residues N(4922), N(4924), N(4935), L(4950), L(4981), N(5013) and T(5064) are unique to lepidopteran RyRs compared with non-lepidopteran insect RyRs. This finding suggests that these residues may be involved in the differences in channel properties between lepidopteran and non-lepidopteran insect RyRs and in the species selective toxicity of diamide insecticides. Furthermore, two alternative splicing sites were identified in the CmRyR gene, one of which was located in the central part of the predicted second SPRY domain. Diagnostic PCR showed that the inclusion frequencies of two mutually exclusive exons (a/b) and one optional exon (c) differed between developmental stages or adult anatomical regions. Our results imply that alternative splicing may be a major means of generating functional diversity in C. medinalis RyR channel.
22558400	Transcriptome and comparative gene expression analysis of Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) in response to southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus.	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: The white backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), causes great damage to many crops by direct feeding or transmitting plant viruses. Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by WBPH, has become a great threat to rice production in East Asia.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By de novo transcriptome assembling and massive parallel pyrosequencing, we constructed two transcriptomes of WBPH and profiled the alternation of gene expression in response to SRBSDV infection in transcriptional level. Over 25 million reads of high-quality DNA sequences and 81388 different unigenes were generated using Illumina technology from both viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH. WBPH has a very similar gene ontological distribution to other two closely related rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus. 7291 microsatellite loci were also predicted which could be useful for further evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated from viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH provided a list of candidate transcripts that potentially were elicited as a response to viral infection. Pathway analyses of a subset of these transcripts indicated that SRBSDV infection may perturb primary metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. In addition, 5.5% (181 out of 3315) of the genes in cell cytoskeleton organization pathway showed obvious changes. Our data also demonstrated that SRBSDV infection activated the immunity regulatory systems of WBPH, such as RNA interference, autophagy and antimicrobial peptide production.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We employed massively parallel pyrosequencing to collect ESTs from viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples of WBPH. 81388 different unigenes have been obtained. We for the first time described the direct effects of a Reoviridae family plant virus on global gene expression profiles of its insect vector using high-throughput sequencing. Our study will provide a road map for future investigations of the fascinating interactions between Reoviridae viruses and their insect vectors, and provide new strategies for crop protection.
22526504	Root metabolic response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes with contrasting tolerance to zinc deficiency and bicarbonate excess.	2012	Planta	Plants are routinely subjected to multiple environmental stresses that constrain growth. Zinc (Zn) deficiency and high bicarbonate are two examples that co-occur in many soils used for rice production. Here, the utility of metabolomics in diagnosing the effect of each stress alone and in combination on rice root function is demonstrated, with potential stress tolerance indicators identified through the use of contrasting genotypes. Responses to the dual stress of combined Zn deficiency and bicarbonate excess included greater root solute leakage, reduced dry matter production, lower monosaccharide accumulation and increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, phenolics, peroxidase and N-rich metabolites in roots. Both hydrogen peroxide concentration and root solute leakage were correlated with higher levels of citrate, allantoin and stigmasterol. Zn stress resulted in lower levels of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate succinate and the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. Bicarbonate stress reduced shoot iron (Fe) concentrations, which was reflected by lower Fe-dependent ascorbate peroxidase activity. Bicarbonate stress also favoured the accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediates malate, fumarate and succinate, along with the non-polar amino acid tyrosine. Genotypic differentiation revealed constitutively higher levels of D-gluconate, 2-oxoglutarate and two unidentified compounds in the Zn-efficient line RIL46 than the Zn-inefficient cultivar IR74, suggesting a possible role for these metabolites in overcoming oxidative stress or improving metal re-distribution.
22721355	Identification of novel MiRNAs and MiRNA expression profiling during grain development in indica rice.	2012	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression in different tissues and at diverse developmental stages, including grain development in japonica rice. To identify novel miRNAs in indica rice and to study their expression patterns during the entire grain filling process, small RNAs from all stages of grain development were sequenced and their expression patterns were studied using customized miRNA chips.

RESULTS: A total of 21 conserved and 91 non-conserved miRNA families were found in developing indica grains. We also discovered 11 potential novel miRNAs based on the presence of their miRNA*s. Expression patterns of these identified miRNAs were analyzed using customized miRNA chips. The results showed that during the filling phase about half of the detected miRNAs were up-regulated, whereas the remainder were down-regulated. Predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs may participate in carbohydrate metabolism, hormone signaling and pathways associated with seed maturity, suggesting potentially important roles in rice grain development.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first genome-wide investigation of miRNAs during the grain-filling phase of an indica variety of rice. The novel miRNAs identified might be involved in new miRNA regulatory pathways for grain development. The complexity of these miRNAs and their targets and interactions require further study to obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying grain development.
22837707	Simulated gastrointestinal pH condition improves antioxidant properties of wheat and rice flours.	2012	Int J Mol Sci	The present study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant properties of wheat and rice flours under simulated gastrointestinal pH condition. After subjecting the wheat and rice flour slurries to simulated gastrointestinal pH condition, both slurries were centrifuged to obtain the crude phenolic extracts for further analyses. Extraction yield, total contents of phenolic and flavonoids were determined as such (untreated) and under simulated gastrointestinal pH condition (treated). 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(•)) scavenging activity, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS(•+)) scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), beta-carotene bleaching (BCB) and iron chelating activity assays were employed for the determination of antioxidant activity of the tested samples. In almost all of the assays performed, significant improvements in antioxidant properties (p < 0.05) were observed in both flours after treatment, suggesting that wheat and rice flours contain considerably heavy amounts of bound phenolics, and that their antioxidant properties might be improved under gastrointestinal digestive conditions.
22751304	Formation of two florets within a single spikelet in the rice tongari-boushi1 mutant.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Communication between the meristem and lateral organs plays important roles in plant development. The TONGARI-BOUSHI1 (TOB1) gene that encodes a YABBY transcription factor is involved in the regulation of meristem maintenance and fate determination of the meristem in rice spikelets. TOB1 is likely to act non-cell autonomously on the meristem, because as this gene is expressed in the lateral organ primordia but not in the meristem. Mutation in of the TOB1 gene results in pleiotropic phenotypes in the spikelet, such as abnormal morphology, formation of the two florets and premature termination of the meristem. Among these phenotypes, the formation of the two florets within a single spikelet is very unique, because one -floret per spikelet is a characteristics of the spikelet of the Oryza genus and is strictly regulated. Here, we describes the phenotype of the two-floret type spikelets and discuss the formation of this type of the spikelet in relation to the regulation of the meristem.
22747959	Kinetic analysis of purified recombinant rice N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase and peak melatonin production in etiolated rice shoots.	2013	J Pineal Res	Rice (Oryza sativa) N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (osASMT), the last enzyme in the synthesis of melatonin, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. We then characterized its enzyme kinetics, which is the first time this has been performed in plants. Purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused recombinant osASMT (GST-osASMT) and GST-free osASMT showed specific enzyme activities of 6.6 and 12.6 pmol/min per mg protein, respectively. When evaluated by the Lineweaver-Burk equation, GST-free osASMT exhibited a K(m) of 864 μm. An in vitro enzyme assay of purified osASMT showed melatonin formation to be proportional to the enzyme and substrate concentrations, as well as time. Unlike animal ASMT, high substrate concentrations did not inhibit the activity of osASMT. Finally, melatonin biosynthesis in rice seedlings was affected by light intensity, with etiolated shoots grown in continuous darkness producing more melatonin than shoots grown in continuous light. The level of melatonin in relation to the light intensity closely paralleled the mRNA level of osASMT in the shoots, suggesting that endogenous melatonin is upregulated in darkness, as is the case in animals.
22698279	MTR1 encodes a secretory fasciclin glycoprotein required for male reproductive development in rice.	2012	Dev Cell	In flowering plants, formation of the haploid male gametophytes in anthers requires the interaction between reproductive cells and the neighboring somatic cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the crucial role of a fasciclin glycoprotein, MICROSPORE AND TAPETUM REGULATOR1 (MTR1), in controlling the development of sporophytic and reproductive cells in rice (Oryza sativa). MTR1 is specifically expressed in the male reproductive cells, yet its mutant exhibits defects in both tapetum and microspore development, causing complete male sterility. We also demonstrate that the fasciclin domains, N-glycolation, and N-terminal signal peptide-mediated plasma membrane localization of MTR1 are required for normal anther development and pollen fertility. Our findings show that rice male reproductive cells secrete the MTR1 protein to control the development of reproductive cells and their adjacent somatic cells, thus providing novel insights into the mechanism of plant male reproductive development.
22684614	Spatial and temporal activity of upstream regulatory regions of rice anther-specific genes in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis.	2013	Transgenic Res	Upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of rice anther-specific genes, namely OSbHLH (coding for basic helix-loop-helix-containing protein) and OSFbox (F-box protein encoding gene), selected from the microarray data have been cloned to control expression of GUS and GFP reporter genes in stably transformed rice. Quantitative real time PCR analysis shows maximum transcript accumulation of these two genes in the meiotic anthers. Analysis of OSbHLH and OSFbox URRs by PLACE database reveal the presence of known pollen-specific cis elements. The URRs of both OSbHLH and OSFbox genes have maximum activity in the meiotic anther stage in rice, but confer constitutive expression in the heterologous dicot system, Arabidopsis, indicative of monocot specificity. Another rice gene (OSIPK; with homology to genes encoding calcium-dependent protein kinases) URR already reported to have anther-specific activity in Arabidopsis and tobacco also confers anther-specific expression in rice and is active in the pollen tubes, suggesting it belongs to the category of late expressed genes. The spatial activity of three URRs has also been analysed by histochemical evaluation of GUS activity in different anther cells/tissues. The activity of OSIPK URR in rice is strongest among the three URRs.
22684798	A comparative proteomic approach to analyse structure, function and evolution of rice chitinases: a step towards increasing plant fungal resistance.	2012	J Mol Model	Glycoside hydrolase family 19 chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) widely distributed in plants, bacteria and viruses catalyse the hydrolysis of chitin and play a major role in plant defense mechanisms and development. Rice possesses several classes of chitinase, out of which a single structure of class I has been reported in PDB to date. In the present study an attempt was made to gain more insight into the structure, function and evolution of class I, II and IV chitinases of GH family 19 from rice. The three-dimensional structures of chitinases were modelled and validated based on available X-ray crystal structures. The structural study revealed that they are highly α-helical and bilobed in nature. These enzymes are single or multi domain and multi-functional in which chitin-binding domain (CBD) and catalytic domain (CatD) are present in class I and IV whereas class II lacks CBD. The CatD possesses a catalytic triad which is thought to be involved in catalytic process. Loop III, which is common in all three classes of chitinases, reflects that it may play a significant role in their function. Our study also confirms that the absence and presence of different loops in GH family 19 of rice may be responsible for various sized products. Molecular phylogeny revealed chitinases in monocotyledons and dicotyledons differed from each other forming two different clusters and may have evolved differentially. More structural study of this enzyme from different plants is required to enhance the knowledge of catalytic mechanism and substrate binding.
22736145	Immunogenicity of a neutralizing epitope from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: M cell targeting ligand fusion protein expressed in transgenic rice calli.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	To increase immune responses of plant-based vaccines in intestine mucosal immune systems, a synthetic neutralizing epitope (sCOE) gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was fused with M cell-targeting ligand (Co1) and introduced into a plant expression vector under the control of rice amylase 3D promoter. The sCOE-Co1 fusion gene was introduced into rice calli via the particle bombardment-mediated transformation method. The stable integration and transcriptional expression of the sCOE-Co1 fusion gene was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The expression of the COE-Co1 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The highest expression level of the COE-Co1 fusion protein reached 0.083 % of the total soluble protein according to quantitative densitometry of Western blot analysis. Mice immunized with transgenic rice calli protein extracts induced significant serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody levels against purified bacterial COE. The systemic and mucosal immune responses were confirmed by measuring COE-specific IgG and IgA antibody-secreting cells in the lymphocytes extracted from the spleen and COE-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells in the Peyer's patches from immunized mice. These results indicated that oral immunization of plant-produced COE-Co1 fusion protein could elicit efficient systemic and mucosal immune responses against the COE antigen. Key message Neutralizing epitope from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-M cell targeting ligand fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli and elicited systemic and mucosal immune responses by oral administration in mice.
22761858	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiratory metabolism. Four putative GLO genes were identified in the rice genome, but how each gene member contributes to GLO activities, particularly to its isozyme profile, is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed how each gene plays a role in isozyme formation and enzymatic activities in both yeast cells and rice tissues. Five GLO isozymes were detected in rice leaves. GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root. Enzymatic assays showed that all yeast-expressed GLO members except GLO5 have enzymatic activities. Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5. GLO1/GLO4 co-expressed in yeast exhibited the same isozyme pattern as that from rice leaves. When either GLO1 or GLO4 was silenced, expressions of both genes were simultaneously suppressed and most of the GLO activities were lost, and consistent with this observation, little GLO isozyme protein was detected in the silenced plants. In contrast, no observable effect was detected when GLO3 was suppressed. Comparative analyses between the GLO isoforms expressed in yeast and the isozymes from rice leaves indicated that two of the five isozymes are homo-oligomers composed of either GLO1 or GLO4, and the other three are hetero-oligomers composed of both GLO1 and GLO4. Our current data suggest that GLO isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice, and the existence of GLO isozymes and GLO molecular and compositional complexities implicate potential novel roles for GLO in plants.
22730241	Proteomic analysis of salicylic acid-induced resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in susceptible and resistant rice.	2012	Proteomics	To probe salicylic acid (SA)-induced sequential events at translational level and factors associated with SA response, we conducted virulence assays and proteomic profiling analysis on rice resistant and susceptible cultivars against Magnaporthe oryzae at various time points after SA treatment. The results showed that SA significantly enhanced rice resistance against M. oryzae. Proteomic analysis of SA-treated leaves unveiled 36 differentially expressed proteins implicated in various functions, including defense, antioxidative enzymes, and signal transduction. Majority of these proteins were induced except three antioxidative enzymes, which were negatively regulated by SA. Consistent with the above findings, SA increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with resistant cultivar C101LAC showing faster response to SA and producing higher level of ROS than susceptible cultivar CO39. Furthermore, we showed that nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1, which is implicated in regulation of ROS production, was strongly induced in C101LAC but not in CO39. Taken together, the findings suggest that resistant rice cultivar might possess a more sensitive SA signaling system or effective pathway than susceptible cultivar. In addition, our results indicate that SA also coordinates other cellular activities such as photosynthesis and metabolism to facilitate defense response and recovery, highlighting the complexity of SA-induced resistance mechanisms.
22763092	Temporal expression profiling of lipase during germination and rice caryopsis development.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Lipolytic enzymes play an important role in plant growth and development. In order to identify their functional roles, the temporal expression profiling of lipase was carried out during rice seed germination, growth and development of caryopsis. Changes in specific activities during germination revealed that the lipolytic activity increased significantly until the end of germination. As the lipase activity increased, two different lipase species were observed, which were designated as Lipase-I and Lipase-II based on their relative mobility. Lipase-II was active during germination. Lipase-I was responsible for lipid mobilization, a requirement for the growth of root and shoot. In comparison with the endosperm, the lipolytic activity in roots was three fold higher. During rice caryopsis development, the lipolytic activity increased gradually from initial panicle development and reached maximum as the grain dried to harvest maturity. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the Lipase-II was a stage specific expressing gene during reproductive growth. The transcript level of Lipase-II reached maximum with completion of germination, then decreased and remained stable during post-germinative growth. During caryopsis development, Lipase-II is predominantly expressed in the developing seeds. The transcript abundance increased gradually during initial stages of development and reached a maximum until seed maturation. The results implicate that the dynamic changes in the enzyme activity of the two isoforms of lipase and gene expression patterns are associated with the energy reserve mobilization during seed germination and reproductive growth.
22750992	In silico study of interaction between rice proteins enhanced disease susceptibility 1 and phytoalexin deficient 4, the regulators of salicylic acid signalling pathway.	2012	J Biosci	Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1), a plant-specific protein has homology with the eukaryotic lipase in their N-terminal halves and a unique domain at its C-termini. EDS1 is known to be an important regulator of biotic stress and an essential component of basal immunity. EDS1 interacts with its positive co-regulator phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD4), resulting in mobilization of the salicylic acid defence pathway. Limited information regarding this interaction in rice is available. To study this interaction, a model of EDS1 and PAD4 proteins from rice was generated and validated with Accelrys DS software version 3.1 using bioinformatics interface. The in silico docking between the two proteins showed a significant protein-protein interaction between rice EDS1 and PAD4, suggesting that they form a dimeric protein complex, which, similar to that in Arabidopsis, is perhaps also important for triggering the salicylic acid signalling pathway in plants.
22847900	Role of the rice transcription factor JAmyb in abiotic stress response.	2013	J Plant Res	Plants have developed certain adaptive responses to environmental stresses that cause adverse effects on growth. To identify genes involved in the adaptive mechanisms, we constructed a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing rice full-length cDNAs, and performed gain-of-function screening under high-salinity stress. In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity. JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation. In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response. Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis. Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb. JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response. Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice.
22798058	A transgenic system for generation of transposon Ac/Ds-induced chromosome rearrangements in rice.	2012	Theor Appl Genet	The maize Activator (Ac)/Dissociation (Ds) transposable element system has been used in a variety of plants for insertional mutagenesis. Ac/Ds elements can also generate genome rearrangements via alternative transposition reactions which involve the termini of closely linked transposons. Here, we introduced a transgene containing reverse-oriented Ac/Ds termini together with an Ac transposase gene into rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare). Among the transgenic progeny, we identified and characterized 25 independent genome rearrangements at three different chromosomal loci. The rearrangements include chromosomal deletions and inversions and one translocation. Most of the deletions occurred within the T-DNA region, but two cases showed the loss of 72 kilobase pairs (kb) and 79 kb of rice genomic DNA flanking the transgene. In addition to deletions, we obtained chromosomal inversions ranging in size from less than 10 kb (within the transgene DNA) to over 1 million base pairs (Mb). For 11 inversions, we cloned and sequenced both inversion breakpoints; in all 11 cases, the inversion junctions contained the typical 8 base pairs (bp) Ac/Ds target site duplications, confirming their origin as transposition products. Together, our results indicate that alternative Ac/Ds transposition can be an efficient tool for functional genomics and chromosomal manipulation in rice.
22841976	Significance of the concentration of chelating ligands on Fe3+-solubility, bioavailability, and uptake in rice plant.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Present study investigated the significance of the concentration of chelating ligand on Fe(3+)-solubility in growth medium and its influence on Fe bioavailability and uptake in rice plant. Rice seedlings were grown in modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) hydroponic growth medium with moderate (250 μM) and high (500 μM) concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and hydroxyiminodisuccinate (HIDS) under sterile and non-sterile conditions. Concentrations of soluble Fe in the growth medium increased with increasing ligand concentrations, and the growth of rice seedlings was higher at moderate ligand concentration than at control (without chelant) and high ligand concentration. This explains the relationship between Fe solubility and bioavailability in the growth medium, and its effect on Fe uptake in rice plant. Fe exists in the growth medium predominantly as particulate (insoluble) forms at low ligand concentration, and as soluble [Fe(OH)(2+), Fe(OH)(2)(+), Fe-L complex] and apparently soluble (colloidal) forms at moderate ligand concentration. At high ligand concentration, most of the Fe(3+) in the growth medium forms soluble Fe-L complex, however, the bioavailability of Fe from Fe-L complex decreased due to lopsided complex formation equilibrium reaction (CFER) between Fe and the ligands. Also, Fe is solubilized forming stable and soluble Fe-L complex, which is then detached as less stable, but soluble and bioavailable substance(s) after (time-dependent) biodegradation. Therefore- i) ligand concentration and stability constant of Fe-L complex (K(Fe-L)) influence Fe bioavailability and uptake in rice plant, and ii) the biodegradable ligands (e.g., HIDS) would be more effective Fe fertilizer than the environmentally persistent and less biodegradable ligands (e.g., EDTA).
22852874	Bioinformatic cis-element analyses performed in Arabidopsis and rice disclose bZIP- and MYB-related binding sites as potential AuxRE-coupling elements in auxin-mediated transcription.	2012	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: In higher plants, a diverse array of developmental and growth-related processes is regulated by the plant hormone auxin. Recent publications have proposed that besides the well-characterized Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) that bind Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs), also members of the bZIP- and MYB-transcription factor (TF) families participate in transcriptional control of auxin-regulated genes via bZIP Response Elements (ZREs) or Myb Response Elements (MREs), respectively.

RESULTS: Applying a novel bioinformatic algorithm, we demonstrate on a genome-wide scale that singular motifs or composite modules of AuxREs, ZREs, MREs but also of MYC2 related elements are significantly enriched in promoters of auxin-inducible genes. Despite considerable, species-specific differences in the genome structure in terms of the GC content, this enrichment is generally conserved in dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Oryza sativa) model plants. Moreover, an enrichment of defined composite modules has been observed in selected auxin-related gene families. Consistently, a bipartite module, which encompasses a bZIP-associated G-box Related Element (GRE) and an AuxRE motif, has been found to be highly enriched. Making use of transient reporter studies in protoplasts, these findings were experimentally confirmed, demonstrating that GREs functionally interact with AuxREs in regulating auxin-mediated transcription.

CONCLUSIONS: Using genome-wide bioinformatic analyses, evolutionary conserved motifs have been defined which potentially function as AuxRE-dependent coupling elements to establish auxin-specific expression patterns. Based on these findings, experimental approaches can be designed to broaden our understanding of combinatorial, auxin-controlled gene regulation.
22815860	Genome-wide transcriptional profiles during temperature and oxidative stress reveal coordinated expression patterns and overlapping regulons in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Genome wide transcriptional changes by cold stress, heat stress and oxidative stress in rice seedlings were analyzed. Heat stress resulted in predominant changes in transcripts of heat shock protein and heat shock transcription factor genes, as well as genes associated with synthesis of scavengers of reactive oxygen species and genes that control the level of sugars, metabolites and auxins. Cold stress treatment caused differential expression of transcripts of various transcription factors including desiccation response element binding proteins and different kinases. Transcripts of genes that are part of calcium signaling, reactive oxygen scavenging and diverse metabolic reactions were differentially expressed during cold stress. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment, resulted in significant up-regulation in transcript levels of genes related to redox homeostasis and down-regulation of transporter proteins. ROS homeostasis appeared to play central role in response to temperature extremes. The key transcription factors that may underlie the concerted transcriptional changes of specific components in various signal transduction networks involved are highlighted. Co-ordinated expression pattern and promoter architectures based analysis (promoter models and overrepresented transcription factor binding sites) suggested potential regulons involved in stress responses. A considerable overlap was noted at the level of transcription as well as in regulatory modules of differentially expressed genes.
22915747	Increased leaf photosynthesis caused by elevated stomatal conductance in a rice mutant deficient in SLAC1, a guard cell anion channel protein.	2012	J Exp Bot	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), leaf photosynthesis is known to be highly correlated with stomatal conductance; however, it remains unclear whether stomatal conductance dominantly limits the photosynthetic rate. SLAC1 is a stomatal anion channel protein controlling stomatal closure in response to environmental [CO(2)]. In order to examine stomatal limitations to photosynthesis, a SLAC1-deficient mutant of rice was isolated and characterized. A TILLING screen of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-derived mutant lines was conducted for the rice SLAC1 orthologue gene Os04g0674700, and four mutant lines containing mutations within the open reading frame were obtained. A second screen using an infrared thermography camera revealed that one of the mutants, named slac1, had a constitutive low leaf temperature phenotype. Measurement of leaf gas exchange showed that slac1 plants grown in the greenhouse had significantly higher stomatal conductance (g (s)), rates of photosynthesis (A), and ratios of internal [CO(2)] to ambient [CO(2)] (C (i)/C (a)) compared with wild-type plants, whereas there was no significant difference in the response of photosynthesis to internal [CO(2)] (A/C (i) curves). These observations demonstrate that in well-watered conditions, stomatal conductance is a major determinant of photosynthetic rate in rice.
22900059	Polyubiquitin is required for growth, development and pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2012	PLoS One	Protein ubiquitination, which is highly selective, regulates many important biological processes including cellular differentiation and pathogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Here, we integrated pharmacological, molecular and proteomic approaches to explore the role of ubiquitination in Magnaporthe oryzae, the leading fungal disease of rice world-wide. Inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis using the 26S proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib, significantly attenuated conidia germination, appressorium formation and pathogenicity in M. oryzae. Gene expression analysis revealed that many genes associated with protein ubiquitination were developmentally regulated during conidia germination. Only a few, including a polyubiquitin encoding gene, MGG_01282, were more abundantly expressed during appressorium formation and under nitrogen starvation. Targeted gene deletion of MGG_01282, in addition to a significant reduction in protein ubiquitination as determined by immuno blot assays, resulted in pleiotropic effects on M. oryzae including reduced growth and sporulation, abnormal conidia morphology, reduced germination and appressorium formation, and the inability to cause disease. Mutants were also defective in sexual development and were female sterile. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 63 candidate polyubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation, which included overrepresentation of proteins involved in translation, transport and protein modification. Our study suggests that ubiquitination of target proteins plays an important role in nutrient assimilation, development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae.
22913653	MIL2 (MICROSPORELESS2) regulates early cell differentiation in the rice anther.	2012	New Phytol	The formation of diverse, appropriately patterned cell types is critical in the development of all complex multicellular organisms. In flowering plants, anther patterning is a complex process essential for successful sexual reproduction. However, few genes regulating this process have been characterized to date. We report here that the gene MICROSPORELESS2 (MIL2) regulates early anther cell differentiation in rice (Oryza sativa). The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination. The MIL2 gene was cloned and its expression pattern was analyzed through RNA in situ hybridization. The localization of the MIL2 protein was observed by immunostaining. MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein. However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed. MIL2 has an expression pattern distinct from that of TPD1. Its transcripts and proteins predominate in inner parietal cells, but show little accumulation in reproductive cells. Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes.
22645600	RiceRBP: A Resource for Experimentally Identified RNA Binding Proteins in Oryza sativa.	2012	Front Plant Sci	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role not only in nuclear gene expression, but also in cytosolic events, including RNA transport, localization, translation, and stability. Although over 200 RBPs are predicted from the Arabidopsis genome alone, relatively little is known about these proteins in plants as many exhibit no homology to known RBPs in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, RBPs likely have low expression levels making them difficult to identify and study. As part of our continuing efforts to understand plant cytosolic gene expression and the factors involved, we employed a combination of affinity chromatography and proteomic techniques to enrich for low abundance RBPs in developing rice seed. Our results have been compiled into RiceRBP (http://www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/RiceRBP), a database that contains 257 experimentally identified proteins, many of which have not previously been predicted to be RBPs. For each of the identified proteins, RiceRBP provides information on transcript and protein sequence, predicted protein domains, details of the experimental identification, and whether antibodies have been generated for public use. In addition, tools are available to analyze expression patterns for the identified genes, view phylogentic relationships and search for orthologous proteins. RiceRBP is a valuable tool for the community in the study of plant RBPs.
22610504	An efficient and high-throughput protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation based on phosphomannose isomerase positive selection in Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Cell Rep	UNLABELLED: A number of Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation systems have been developed and widely used in numerous laboratories and research institutes. However, those systems generally employ antibiotics like kanamycin and hygromycin, or herbicide as selectable agents, and are used for the small-scale experiments. To address high-throughput production of transgenic rice plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and to eliminate public concern on antibiotic markers, we developed a comprehensive efficient protocol, covering from explant preparation to the acquisition of low copy events by real-time PCR analysis before transplant to field, for high-throughput production of transgenic plants of Japonica rice varieties Wanjing97 and Nipponbare using Escherichia coli phosphomannose isomerase gene (pmi) as a selectable marker. The transformation frequencies (TF) of Wanjing97 and Nipponbare were achieved as high as 54.8 and 47.5%, respectively, in one round of selection of 7.5 or 12.5 g/L mannose appended with 5 g/L sucrose. High-throughput transformation from inoculation to transplant of low copy events was accomplished within 55-60 days. Moreover, the Taqman assay data from a large number of transformants showed 45.2% in Wanjing97 and 31.5% in Nipponbare as a low copy rate, and the transformants are fertile and follow the Mendelian segregation ratio. This protocol facilitates us to perform genome-wide functional annotation of the open reading frames and utilization of the agronomically important genes in rice under a reduced public concern on selectable markers.

KEY MESSAGE: We describe a comprehensive protocol for large scale production of transgenic Japonica rice plants using non-antibiotic selectable agent, at simplified, cost- and labor-saving manners.
22640001	Melatonin promotes seminal root elongation and root growth in transgenic rice after germination.	2012	J Pineal Res	The effect of melatonin on root growth after germination was examined in transgenic rice seedlings expressing sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT). Enhanced melatonin levels were found in T(3) homozygous seedlings because of the ectopic overexpression of sheep NAT, which is believed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis in animals. Compared with wild-type rice seeds, the transgenic rice seeds showed enhanced seminal root growth and an analogous number of adventitious roots 4 and 10 days after seeding on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium. The enhanced initial seminal root growth in the transgenic seedlings matched their increased root biomass well. We also found that treatment with 0.5 and 1 μM melatonin promoted seminal root growth of the wild type under continuous light. These results indicate that melatonin plays an important role in regulating both seminal root length and root growth after germination in monocotyledonous rice plants. This is the first report on the effects of melatonin on root growth in gain-of-function mutant plants that produce high levels of melatonin.
22851681	Identification and fine mapping of qCTH4, a quantitative trait loci controlling the chlorophyll content from tillering to heading in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	None	J Hered	The chlorophyll content is one of the most important traits selected by breeders, and it is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in rice. We analyzed the QTL controlling chlorophyll content by using 94 RILs derived from a cross between 2 japonica rice cultivars, Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) and Shennong265 (SN265). Twenty-two QTLs controlling chlorophyll content at tillering stage, heading stage, and maturity stage were detected, respectively. Among them, Rice cv. LTH had a positive allele only at 1 locus (qCTH4) on chromosome 4. Further analysis indicated that the genetic effect of qCTH4 was the net effects within the period from tillering to heading. The QTL qCTH4 controlling chlorophyll content from tillering to heading locates between RM255 and RM349 on chromosome 4 with a LOD score 19.41, and the QTL qCTH4 explains 61.42% of phenotypic variation. In order to eliminate the influence of other QTLs, 1 single residual heterozygous plant, RH-qCTH4, was selected based on the genotypes of 114 Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. Using the segregating population derived from RH-qCTH4 by self-crossing, this region was narrowed down to an interval between RM3276 and RM17494 in an approximately 771kb target region. These results are useful for map-based cloning of qCTH4 and for marker-assisted selection of high photosynthetic efficiency variety.
22811434	Cytokinin activity of cis-zeatin and phenotypic alterations induced by overexpression of putative cis-Zeatin-O-glucosyltransferase in rice.	2012	Plant Physiol	cis-Zeatin (cZ) is generally regarded as a cytokinin with little or no activity, compared with the highly active trans-zeatin (tZ). Although recent studies suggested possible roles for cZ, its physiological significance remains unclear. In our studies with rice (Oryza sativa), cZ inhibited seminal root elongation and up-regulated cytokinin-inducible genes, and its activities were comparable to those of tZ. Tracer experiments showed that exogenously supplied cZ-riboside was mainly converted into cZ derivatives but scarcely into tZ derivatives, indicating that isomerizations of cZ derivatives into tZ derivatives are a minor pathway in rice cytokinin metabolism. We identified three putative cZ-O-glucosyltransferases (cZOGT1, cZOGT2, and cZOGT3) in rice. The cZOGTs preferentially catalyzed O-glucosylation of cZ and cZ-riboside rather than tZ and tZ-riboside in vitro. Transgenic rice lines ectopically overexpressing the cZOGT1 and cZOGT2 genes exhibited short-shoot phenotypes, delay of leaf senescence, and decrease in crown root number, while cZOGT3 overexpressor lines did not show shortened shoots. These results propose that cZ activity has a physiological impact on the growth and development of rice.
22768325	Cell suspension culture-mediated incorporation of the rice bel gene into transgenic cotton.	2012	PLoS One	Cotton plants engineered for resistance to the herbicides, glyphosate or glufosinate have made a considerable impact on the production of the crop worldwide. In this work, embryogenic cell cultures derived from Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Coker 312 hypocotyl callus were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP81A6 (bel). In rice, bel has been shown to confer resistance to both bentazon and sulfanylurea herbicides. Transformed cells were selected on a liquid medium supplemented alternately or simultaneously with kanamycin (50mg/L) and bentazon (4.2 µmol). A total of 17 transgenic cotton lines were recovered, based on the initial resistance to bentazon and on PCR detection of the bel transgene. Bel integration into the cotton genome was confirmed by Southern blot and expression of the transgene was verified by RT-PCR. In greenhouse and experimental plot trials, herbicide (bentazon) tolerance of up to 1250 mg/L was demonstrated in the transgenic plants. Transgenic lines with a single copy of the bel gene showed normal Mendelian inheritance of the characteristic. Importantly, resistance to bentazon was shown to be stably incorporated in the T1, T2 and T3 generations of self-fertilised descendents and in plants outcrossed to another upland cotton cultivar. Engineering resistance to bentazon in cotton through the heterologous expression of bel opens the possibility of incorporating this trait into elite cultivars, a strategy that would give growers a more flexible alternative to weed management in cotton crops.
22836167	Transcriptional network analysis of the tryptophan-accumulating rice mutant during grain filling.	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	In a previous study, we selected a high tryptophan (Trp)-accumulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant line by in vitro mutagenesis using gamma rays. To obtain detailed information about the Trp biosynthetic pathway during the grain-filling in rice, we investigated the gene expression profiles in the wild-type (cv. Dongan) and the high-level Trp-accumulating mutant line (MRVII-33) at five different grain-filling stages using microarray analysis. The mutant line showed approximately 6.3-fold higher Trp content and 2.3-fold higher amino acids compared with the original cultivar at the final stage (stage V). The intensity of gene expression was analyzed and compared between the wild-type and mutant line at each of the five grain-filling stages using the Rice 4 × 44K oligo DNA microarray. Among the five stages, stage III showed the highest gene expression changes for both up- and down-regulated genes. Among the Trp biosynthesis-related genes, trpG showed high expression in the mutant line during stages I to IV and trpE showed higher at stage III. Gene clustering was performed based on the genes of KEGG's amino acid metabolism, and a total of 276 genes related to amino acid metabolism were placed into three clusters. The functional annotation enrichment analysis of the genes classified into the three clusters was also conducted using ClueGO. It was found that cluster 3 uniquely included biological processes related to aromatic amino acid metabolism. These results suggest that gene analysis based on microarray data is useful for elucidating the biological mechanisms of Trp accumulation in high Trp-accumulating mutants at each of the grain-filling stages.
22996677	Functional analysis of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 revealed their involvement in the heat shock response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	J Exp Bot	The heat shock response (HSR) induces the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) through the activation of heat shock factors (HSF). HSF binding protein (HSBP) is reported to modulate the function of HSF by binding to their trimer and hence to regulate HSR. This report describes the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice. Both genes expressed ubiquitously in all tissues under normal growth conditions while their expression levels were significantly increased during recovery after heat shock treatment. Subcellular localization revealed the cytosol-nuclear localization of both OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in onion epidermal cells. The yeast two-hybrid assay depicted the self-binding ability of both genes. Both genes were also important for seed development, as their knock-down lines were associated with significant seed abortion. The thermotolerance assay revealed that OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 are negative regulators of HSR and involved in acquired thermotolerance but not in basal thermotolerance since their over-expression transgenic lines pre-heated at sublethal temperature, showed significantly decreased seedling survival after heat shock treatment. Furthermore, antioxidant activity and gene expression of catalase and peroxidase was significantly increased in knock-down transgenic seedlings of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 after heat stress compared with the wild type. The expression of heat specific HSPs was also increased significantly in knockdown line of both genes but in a specific manner, suggesting the involvement of HSBP genes in different pathways. Overall, the present study reveals the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice.
22987115	Transcriptomic changes and signalling pathways induced by arsenic stress in rice roots.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Arsenic (As) is considered the most common toxic metalloid, but its molecular mode of action is not well understood. We investigated whether arsenate [As(V)] can induce intracellular reactive oxygen species production and calcium oscillation in rice roots. To better understand the molecular basis of plant cell responses to As, we performed a large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during As(V) stress. As(V) induced genes involved in abiotic stress, detoxification pathways and secondary metabolic process. Genes involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis, cell cycle and oligopeptide transport were mainly downregulated. Genes encoding signalling components such as receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases protein kinase, APETALA2/ethylene response factor, heat shock factor, MYB and zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem transcription factors were increased in expression. The expression of GARP-G2-like and C3H transcription factors was specifically modulated by As(V) stress. The predominant families of As(V)-regulated transporters belonged to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily and telurite-resistance/dicarboxylate transporters. Several factors involved in signaling, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), MAPK kinase kinase and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), were also upregulated. Moreover, As(V) markedly increased the activity of MAPKs and CDPK-like kinases, and CDPK and NADPH oxidases were involved in As-induced MAPK activation. Further characterization of these As(V)-responsive genes and signalling pathways may help better understand the mechanisms of metalloid uptake, tolerance and detoxification in plants.
22971580	A comparative study of the characteristics of cross-linked, oxidized and dual-modified rice starches.	2012	Molecules	Rice starch was cross-linked with epichlorohydrin (0.3%, w/w, on a dry starch basis) and oxidized with sodium hypochlorite (2.5% w/w), respectively. Two dual-modified rice starch samples (oxidized cross-linked rice starch and cross-linked oxidized rice starch) were obtained by the oxidation of cross-linked rice starch and the cross-linking of oxidized rice starch at the same level of reagents. The physicochemical properties of native rice starch, cross-linked rice starch and oxidized rice starch were also studied parallel with those of the two dual-modified rice starch samples using rapid visco analysis (RVA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic rheometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the levels of cross-linking and oxidation used in this study did not cause any significant changes in the morphology of rice starch granules. Cross-linked oxidized starch showed lower swelling power (SP) and solubility, and higher paste clarity in comparison with native starch. Cross-linked oxidized rice starch also had the lowest tendency of retrogradation and highest ability to resistant to shear compared with native, cross-linked, oxidized and oxidized cross-linked rice starches. These results suggest that the undesirable properties in native, cross-linked and oxidized rice starch samples could be overcome through dual-modification.
23020599	Does growth under elevated CO₂ moderate photoacclimation in rice?	2013	Physiol Plant	Acclimation of plant photosynthesis to light irradiance (photoacclimation) involves adjustments in levels of pigments and proteins and larger scale changes in leaf morphology. To investigate the impact of rising atmospheric CO₂ on crop physiology, we hypothesize that elevated CO₂ interacts with photoacclimation in rice (Oryza sativa). Rice was grown under high light (HL: 700 µmol m⁻²  s⁻¹), low light (LL: 200 µmol m⁻²  s⁻¹), ambient CO₂ (400 µl l⁻¹) and elevated CO₂ (1000 µl l⁻¹). Leaf six was measured throughout. Obscuring meristem tissue during development did not alter leaf thickness indicating that mature leaves are responsible for sensing light during photoacclimation. Elevated CO₂ raised growth chamber photosynthesis and increased tiller formation at both light levels, while it increased leaf length under LL but not under HL. Elevated CO₂ always resulted in increased leaf growth rate and tiller production. Changes in leaf thickness, leaf area, Rubisco content, stem and leaf starch, sucrose and fructose content were all dominated by irradiance and unaffected by CO₂. However, stomata responded differently; they were significantly smaller in LL grown plants compared to HL but this effect was significantly suppressed under elevated CO₂. Stomatal density was lower under LL, but this required elevated CO₂ and the magnitude was adaxial or abaxial surface-dependent. We conclude that photoacclimation in rice involves a systemic signal. Furthermore, extra carbohydrate produced under elevated CO₂ is utilized in enhancing leaf and tiller growth and does not enhance or inhibit any feature of photoacclimation with the exception of stomatal morphology.
22936328	Genome-wide analysis of lectin receptor-like kinase family from Arabidopsis and rice.	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) are class of membrane proteins found in higher plants that are involved in diverse functions ranging from plant growth and development to stress tolerance. The basic structure of LecRLK protein comprises of a lectin and a kinase domain, which are interconnected by transmembrane region. Here we have identified LecRLKs from Arabidopsis and rice and studied these proteins on the basis of their expression profile and phylogenies. We were able to identify 32 G-type, 42 L-type and 1 C-type LecRLKs from Arabidopsis and 72 L-type, 100 G-type and 1 C-type LecRLKs from rice on the basis of their annotation and presence of lectin as well kinase domains. The whole family is rather intron-less. We have sub-grouped the gene family on the basis of their phylogram. Although on the basis of sequence the members of each group are closely associated but their functions vary to a great extent. The interacting partners and coexpression data of the genes revealed the importance of gene family in physiology and stress related responses. An in-depth analysis on gene-expression suggested clear demarcation in roles assigned to each gene. To gain additional knowledge about the LecRLK gene family, we searched for previously unreported motifs and checked their importance structurally on the basis of homology modelling. The analysis revealed that the gene family has important roles in diverse functions in plants, both in the developmental stages and in stress conditions. This study thus opens the possibility to explore the roles that LecRLKs might play in life of a plant.
22984395	Transgenerational inheritance of modified DNA methylation patterns and enhanced tolerance induced by heavy metal stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is sensitive and responsive to stressful environmental conditions. Nonetheless, the extent to which condition-induced somatic methylation modifications can impose transgenerational effects remains to be fully understood. Even less is known about the biological relevance of the induced epigenetic changes for potentially altered well-being of the organismal progenies regarding adaptation to the specific condition their progenitors experienced.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed DNA methylation pattern by gel-blotting at genomic loci representing transposable elements and protein-coding genes in leaf-tissue of heavy metal-treated rice (Oryza sativa) plants (S0), and its three successive organismal generations. We assessed expression of putative genes involved in establishing and/or maintaining DNA methylation patterns by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. We measured growth of the stressed plants and their unstressed progenies vs. the control plants. We found (1) relative to control, DNA methylation patterns were modified in leaf-tissue of the immediately treated plants, and the modifications were exclusively confined to CHG hypomethylation; (2) the CHG-demethylated states were heritable via both maternal and paternal germline, albeit often accompanying further hypomethylation; (3) altered expression of genes encoding for DNA methyltransferases, DNA glycosylase and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor (DDM1) were induced by the stress; (4) progenies of the stressed plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to the same stress their progenitor experienced, and this transgenerational inheritance of the effect of condition accompanying heritability of modified methylation patterns.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that stressful environmental condition can produce transgenerational epigenetic modifications. Progenies of stressed plants may develop enhanced adaptability to the condition, and this acquired trait is inheritable and accord with transmission of the epigenetic modifications. We suggest that environmental induction of heritable modifications in DNA methylation provides a plausible molecular underpinning for the still contentious paradigm of inheritance of acquired traits originally put forward by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck more than 200 years ago.
22984040	GM research. Charges fly, confusion reigns over golden rice study in Chinese children.	2012	Science	
23000158	Ectopic expression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene from wild rice, OgUBC1, confers resistance against UV-B radiation and Botrytis infection in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2012	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	A previously unidentified gene encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme was isolated from leaves of wild rice plant treated with wounding and microbe-associated molecular patterns. The OgUBC1 gene was composed of 148 amino acids and contained a typical active site and 21 ubiquitin thioester intermediate interaction residues and 4 E3 interaction residues. Both exogenous application of salicylic acid and UV-B irradiation triggered expression of OgUBC1 in leaves of wild rice. Recombinant OgUBC1 proteins bound to ubiquitins in vitro, proposing that the protein might act as E2 enzyme in planta. Heterologous expression of the OgUBC1 in Arabidopsis thaliana protected plants from cellular damage caused by an excess of UV-B radiation. A stable expression of chalcone synthase gene was detected in leaves of OgUBC1-expressing Arabidopsis, resulting in producing higher amounts of anthocyanin than those in wild-type Col-0 plants. Additionally, both pathogenesis-related gene1 and 5 were transcribed in the transgenic Arabidopsis in the absence of pathogen infection. The OgUBC1-expressing plants were resistant to the infection of Botrytis cinerea. Taken together, we suggested that the OgUBC1 is involved in ubiquitination process important for cellular response against biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.
23240403	[Research on rice blast, corn and broad bean rust leaves by FTIR spectroscopy].	2012	Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi	Fourier transform infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study healthy and diseased leaves of rice, corn, and broad bean. The results show that the infrared spectra of the leaves are mainly composed of the absorption bands of proteins and polysaccharide. The spectra are similar, but the differences were observed in the peak positions, shapes, and absorption ratios. The remarkable differences in correlation coefficients were also observed in the region of 1 800-1 000 cm(-1) of the second derivate spectra. The absorption ratio A1 056 /A1 652 of healthy rice leaves and rice blast leaves, A1 652/A2 920 of healthy broad bean leaves and leaves, A1 056/A2 920 of healthy corn and corn rust (non-lesion site), and A1 652/A2 920 of healthy corn and corn rust (lesion site) all show a decline from healthy to diseased leaves, showing that the contents of polysaccharide and the protein have some differences.
22967050	Suppression of α-amylase genes improves quality of rice grain ripened under high temperature.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	High temperature impairs rice (Oryza sativa) grain filling by inhibiting the deposition of storage materials such as starch, resulting in mature grains with a chalky appearance, currently a major problem for rice farming in Asian countries. Such deterioration of grain quality is accompanied by the altered expression of starch metabolism-related genes. Here we report the involvement of a starch-hydrolyzing enzyme, α-amylase, in high temperature-triggered grain chalkiness. In developing seeds, high temperature induced the expression of α-amylase genes, namely Amy1A, Amy1C, Amy3A, Amy3D and Amy3E, as well as α-amylase activity, while it decreased an α-amylase-repressing plant hormone, ABA, suggesting starch to be degraded by α-amylase in developing grains under elevated temperature. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated suppression of α-amylase genes in ripening seeds resulted in fewer chalky grains under high-temperature conditions. As the extent of the decrease in chalky grains was highly correlated to decreases in the expression of Amy1A, Amy1C, Amy3A and Amy3B, these genes would be involved in the chalkiness through degradation of starch accumulating in the developing grains. The results show that activation of α-amylase by high temperature is a crucial trigger for grain chalkiness and that its suppression is a potential strategy for ameliorating grain damage from global warming.
22994889	Silicon nutrition increases grain yield, which, in turn, exerts a feed-forward stimulation of photosynthetic rates via enhanced mesophyll conductance and alters primary metabolism in rice.	2012	New Phytol	Silicon (Si) is not considered to be an essential element for higher plants and is believed to have no effect on primary metabolism in unstressed plants. In rice (Oryza sativa), Si nutrition improves grain production; however, no attempt has been made to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying such responses. Here, we assessed crop yield and combined advanced gas exchange analysis with carbon isotope labelling and metabolic profiling to measure the effects of Si nutrition on rice photosynthesis, together with the associated metabolic changes, by comparing wild-type rice with the low-Si rice mutant lsi1 under unstressed conditions. Si improved the harvest index, paralleling an increase in nitrogen use efficiency. Higher crop yields associated with Si nutrition exerted a feed-forward effect on photosynthesis which was fundamentally associated with increased mesophyll conductance. By contrast, Si nutrition did not affect photosynthetic gas exchange during the vegetative growth phase or in de-grained plants. In addition, Si nutrition altered primary metabolism by stimulating amino acid remobilization. Our results indicate a stimulation of the source capacity, coupled with increased sink demand, in Si-treated plants; therefore, we identify Si nutrition as an important target in attempts to improve the agronomic yield of rice.
22965749	Increased polyamine biosynthesis enhances stress tolerance by preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species: T-DNA mutational analysis of Oryza sativa lysine decarboxylase-like protein 1.	2012	Mol Cells	A highly oxidative stress-tolerant japonica rice line was isolated by T-DNA insertion mutation followed by screening in the presence of 50 mM H(2)O(2). The T-DNA insertion was mapped to locus Os09g0547500, the gene product of which was annotated as lysine decarboxylase-like protein (GenBank accession No. AK062595). We termed this gene OsLDC-like 1, for Oryza sativa lysine decarboxylase-like 1. The insertion site was in the second exon and resulted in a 27 amino acid N-terminal deletion. Despite this defect in OsLDC-like 1, the mutant line exhibited enhanced accumulation of the polyamines (PAs) putrescine, spermidine, and spermine under conditions of oxidative stress. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant line was assessed by qRT-PCR analysis of NADPH oxidase (RbohD and RbohF), and by DCFH-DA staining. Cellular levels of ROS in osldc-like 1 leaves were significantly lower than those in the wild-type (WT) rice after exposure to oxidative, high salt and acid stresses. Exogenously-applied PAs such as spermidine and spermine significantly inhibited the stress-induced accumulation of ROS and cell damage in WT leaves. Additionally, the activities of ROS-detoxifying enzymes were increased in the homozygous mutant line in the presence or absence of H(2)O(2). Thus, mutation of OsLDC-like 1 conferred an oxidative stress-tolerant phenotype. These results suggest that increased cellular PA levels have a physiological role in preventing stress-induced ROS and ethylene accumulation and the resultant cell damage.
23012434	YSL16 is a phloem-localized transporter of the copper-nicotianamine complex that is responsible for copper distribution in rice.	2012	Plant Cell	Cu is an essential element for plant growth, but the molecular mechanisms of its distribution and redistribution within the plants are unknown. Here, we report that Yellow stripe-like16 (YSL16) is involved in Cu distribution and redistribution in rice (Oryza sativa). Rice YSL16 was expressed in the roots, leaves, and unelongated nodes at the vegetative growth stage and highly expressed in the upper nodes at the reproductive stage. YSL16 was expressed at the phloem of nodes and vascular tissues of leaves. Knockout of this gene resulted in a higher Cu concentration in the older leaves but a lower concentration in the younger leaves at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, a higher Cu concentration was found in the flag leaf and husk, but less Cu was present in the brown rice, resulting in a significant reduction in fertility in the knockout line. Isotope labeling experiments with (65)Cu showed that the mutant lost the ability to transport Cu-nicotianamine from older to younger leaves and from the flag leaf to the panicle. Rice YSL16 transported the Cu-nicotianamine complex in yeast. Taken together, our results indicate that Os-YSL16 is a Cu-nicotianamine transporter that is required for delivering Cu to the developing young tissues and seeds through phloem transport.
22989945	Methyl jasmonate-induced lateral root formation in rice: the role of heme oxygenase and calcium.	2013	J Plant Physiol	Lateral roots (LRs) play important roles in increasing the absorptive capacity of roots as well as to anchor the plant in the soil. Therefore, understanding the regulation of LR development is of agronomic importance. In this study, we examined the effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on LR formation in rice. Treatment with MJ induced LR formation and heme oxygenase (HO) activity. As well, MJ could induce OsHO1 mRNA expression. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (the specific inhibitor of HO) and hemoglobin [the carbon monoxide/nitric oxide (NO) scavenger] reduced LR formation, HO activity and OsHO1 expression. LR formation and HO activity induced by MJ was reduced by the specific NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-oxide. The effects of Ca(2+) chelators, Ca(2+)-channel inhibitors, and calmodulin (CaM) antagonists on LR formation induced by MJ were also examined. All these inhibitors were effective in reducing the action of MJ. However, Ca(2+) chelators and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors induced HO activity when combining with MJ further. It is concluded that Ca(2+) may regulate MJ action mainly through CaM-dependent mechanism.
22970232	Protein disulfide isomerase-like protein 1-1 controls endosperm development through regulation of the amount and composition of seed proteins in rice.	2012	PLoS One	Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone protein involved in oxidative protein folding by acting as a catalyst and assisting folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A genome database search showed that rice contains 19 PDI-like genes. However, their functions are not clearly identified. This paper shows possible functions of rice PDI-like protein 1-1 (PDIL1-1) during seed development. Seeds of the T-DNA insertion PDIL1-1 mutant, PDIL1-1Δ, identified by genomic DNA PCR and western blot analysis, display a chalky phenotype and a thick aleurone layer. Protein content per seed was significantly lower and free sugar content higher in PDIL1-1Δ mutant seeds than in the wild type. Proteomic analysis of PDIL1-1Δ mutant seeds showed that PDIL1-1 is post-translationally regulated, and its loss causes accumulation of many types of seed proteins including glucose/starch metabolism- and ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenging-related proteins. In addition, PDIL1-1 strongly interacts with the cysteine protease OsCP1. Our data indicate that the opaque phenotype of PDIL1-1Δ mutant seeds results from production of irregular starch granules and protein body through loss of regulatory activity for various proteins involved in the synthesis of seed components.
23226082	Variation in heading date conceals quantitative trait loci for other traits of importance in breeding selection of rice.	2012	Breed Sci	To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the primary target traits for selection in practical rice breeding programs, backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from crosses between temperate japonica rice cultivars Nipponbare and Koshihikari were evaluated for 50 agronomic traits at six experimental fields located throughout Japan. Thirty-three of the 50 traits were significantly correlated with heading date. Using a linkage map including 647 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a total of 122 QTLs for 38 traits were mapped on all rice chromosomes except chromosomes 5 and 9. Fifty-eight of the 122 QTLs were detected near the heading date QTLs Hd16 and Hd17 and the remaining 64 QTLs were found in other chromosome regions. QTL analysis of 51 BILs having homozygous for the Koshihikari chromosome segments around Hd16 and Hd17 allowed us to detect 40 QTLs associated with 27 traits; 23 of these QTLs had not been detected in the original analysis. Among the 97 QTLs for the 30 traits measured in multiple environments, the genotype-by-environment interaction was significant for 44 QTLs and not significant for 53 QTLs. These results led us to propose a new selection strategy to improve agronomic performance in temperate japonica rice cultivars.
23139871	Sequence polymorphisms in wild, weedy, and cultivated rice suggest seed-shattering locus sh4 played a minor role in Asian rice domestication.	2012	Ecol Evol	The predominant view regarding Asian rice domestication is that the initial origin of nonshattering involved a single gene of large effect, specifically, the sh4 locus via the evolutionary replacement of a dominant allele for shattering with a recessive allele for reduced shattering. Data have accumulated to challenge this hypothesis. Specifically, a few studies have reported occasional seed-shattering plants from populations of the wild progenitor of cultivated rice (Oryza rufipogon complex) being homozygous for the putative "nonshattering" sh4 alleles. We tested the sh4 hypothesis for the domestication of cultivated rice by obtaining genotypes and phenotypes for a diverse set of samples of wild, weedy, and cultivated rice accessions. The cultivars were fixed for the putative "nonshattering" allele and nonshattering phenotype, but wild rice accessions are highly polymorphic for the putative "nonshattering" allele (frequency ∼26%) with shattering phenotype. All weedy rice accessions are the "nonshattering" genotype at the sh4 locus but with shattering phenotype. These data challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that a single nucleotide mutation ("G"/"T") of the sh4 locus is the major driving force for rice domestication. Instead, we hypothesize that unidentified shattering loci are responsible for the initial domestication of cultivated rice through reduced seed shattering.
22750319	Differential induction of two different cystatin genes during pathogenesis of Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) in wheat under the influence of jasmonic acid.	2012	Gene	In the present study, expression patterns of two different wheat cystatins (WCs) were studied under the influence of jasmonate signaling in triggering resistance against Karnal bunt (KB). Cystatins are cysteine proteinase inhibitors (CPI) constituting a multigene family which regulate the activity of endo- and/or exogenous cysteine proteinases (CP). Two wheat varieties HD-29 (resistant, R) and WH-542 (susceptible, S) were pre-conditioned with jasmonate and then artificially inoculated with sporidial suspension of Tilletia indica to study its influence in inducing defense by regulating cystatin genes. On the transcriptional level, WC4 and WC5 gave different temporal expression patterns. Expression of WC4 was higher in boot emergence stage which is most susceptible to KB and then slowly declined in both varieties. Expression of WC5 showed an entirely reverse pattern of expression, which kept on rising as the grains matured. Cystatin activity determination by inhibitor assay gave higher activity in resistant variety and under JA treatment. Estimation of specific activity of total cystatin at different days after inoculation (DAI) showed that JA positively induced cystatin expression in both varieties but R variety always registered a greater cystatin expression than the susceptible one (P<0.05). In plants inoculated with pathogen, initially there was a rise in cystatin activity which gradually decreased 7 DAI when compared with the un-inoculated plants. Based on these findings it is clearly demonstrated that jasmonate acts as a potential activator of induced resistance by up-regulating cystatin expression and provides the conditioning effect prior to infection through the maintenance of critical balance of CP/CPI interaction. However, different cystatin genes show different temporal expression patterns and may play different roles at various developmental stages of the grain.
22930448	A TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein confers multiple abiotic stress tolerances in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Mol Biol	The TFIIIA-type zinc finger transcription factors are involved in plant development and abiotic stress responses. Most TFIIIA-type zinc finger proteins are transcription repressors due to existence of an EAR-motif in their amino acid sequences. In this work, we found that ZFP182, a TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein, forms a homodimer in the nucleus and exhibits trans-activation activity in yeast cells. The deletion analysis indicated that a Leu-rich region at C-terminus is required for the trans-activation. Overexpression of ZFP182 significantly enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerances, including salt, cold and drought tolerances in transgenic rice. Overexpression of ZFP182 promotes accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as free proline and soluble sugars, in transgenic rice. ZFP182 activates the expression of OsP5CS encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and OsLEA3 under stress conditions, while OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were regulated by ZFP182 under both normal and stress conditions. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis assay showed that DRE-like elements in ZFP182 promoter are involved in dehydration-induced expression of ZFP182. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that ZFP182 interacted with several ribosomal proteins including ZIURP1, an ubiquitin fused to ribosomal protein L40. The in vivo and in vitro interactions of ZFP182 and ZIURP1 were further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and His pull-down assays. Our studies provide new clues in the understanding of the mechanisms for TFIIIA-type zinc finger transcription factor mediated stress tolerance and a candidate gene for improving stress tolerance in crops.
22899079	Oscillation regulation of Ca2+ /calmodulin and heat-stress related genes in response to heat stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Signal Behav	The Ca ( 2+) /calmodulin (CaM) signaling pathway mediates the heat stress (HS) response and acquisition of thermotolerance in plants. We showed that the rice CaM1-1 isoform can interpret a Ca ( 2+) signature difference in amplitude, frequency, and temporal-spatial properties in regulating transcription of nucleoplasmic small heat-shock protein gene (sHSPC/N) during HS. Ca ( 2+) and A23187 treatments under HS generated an intense and sustained increase in [Ca ( 2+) ]cyt and accelerated the expression of CaM1-1 and sHSPC/N genes, which suggests that HS-induced apoplastic Ca ( 2+) influx was responsible for the [Ca ( 2+) ]cyt transient and downstream HS signaling. Here, we discuss an emerging paradigm in the oscillation regulation of CaM1-1 expression during HS and highlight the areas that need further investigation.
23007447	Overexpression of rice LRK1 restricts internode elongation by down-regulating OsKO2.	2013	Biotechnol Lett	Rice (Oryza sativa) has the potential to undergo rapid internodal elongation which determines plant height. Gibberellin is involved in internode elongation. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are the largest subfamily of transmembrane receptor-like kinases in plants. LRR-RLKs play important functions in mediating a variety of cellular processes and regulating responses to environmental signals. LRK1, a PSK receptor homolog, is a member of the LRR-RLK family. In the present study, differences in ectopic expression of LRK1 were consistent with extent of rice internode elongation. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase.
23226081	Comparison of phenotypic versus marker-assisted background selection for the SUB1 QTL during backcrossing in rice.	2012	Breed Sci	Marker assisted backcrossing has been used effectively to transfer the submergence tolerance gene SUB1 into popular rice varieties, but the approach can be costly. The selection strategy comprising foreground marker and phenotypic selection was investigated as an alternative. The non-significant correlation coefficients between ranking of phenotypic selection and ranking of background marker selection in BC(2)F(1), BC(3)F(1) and BC(3)F(2) generations indicated inefficiency of phenotypic selection compared to marker-assisted background selection with respect to recovery of the recipient genome. In addition, the introgression size of the chromosome fragment containing SUB1 was approximately 17 Mb, showing the effects of linkage drag. The significant correlation coefficient between rankings of phenotypic selection with the percentage of recipient alleles in the BC(1)F(1) generation suggested that background selection could be avoided in this generation to minimize the genotyping cost. The phenotypically selected best plant of the BC(3)F(1) generation was selfed and backcross recombinant lines were selected in the resulting BC(3)F(4) generation. The selection strategy could be appropriate for the introgression of SUB1 QTL in countries that lack access to high-throughput genotyping facilities.
23116667	Overexpression of a protein disulfide isomerase-like protein from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum enhances mercury tolerance in transgenic rice.	2012	Plant Sci	MTH1745, from thermophilic archaea Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum, is a protein disulfide isomerase-like protein (PDIL) with a chaperone function and disulfide isomerase activity. Mercuric cations have a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and consequently inhibit plant growth. Disulfide compounds (e.g., copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn SOD) and sulfhydryl compounds (e.g., glutathione, phytochelatins, and metallothioneins) play important roles in mercury (Hg) response. To study the relationship between Hg detoxification and PDILs, we overexpressed MTH1745 in Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic rice seedlings displayed Hg tolerance with obvious phenotypes and more effective photosynthesis compared to wild-type plants. Furthermore, lower levels of superoxide anion radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde were observed in leaves or roots of transgenic plants. Antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were notably higher in transgenic seedlings under different concentrations of mercuric chloride. Moreover, increased content of non-protein thiols, reduced glutathione (GSH), and GSH/GSSG (GSSG, oxidized glutathione) ratio were also observed in the detoxification of Hg. These results indicated that heterologous expression of a PDIL from extremophiles in rice could protect the synthesis, increase stability of proteins, and enhance Hg tolerance in rice.
22989375	Domestication and geographic origin of Oryza sativa in China: insights from multilocus analysis of nucleotide variation of O. sativa and O. rufipogon.	2012	Mol Ecol	Previous studies have indicated that China is one of the domestication centres of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), and common wild rice (O. rufipogon) is the progenitor of O. sativa. However, the number of domestication times and the geographic origin of Asian cultivated rice in China are still under debate. In this study, 100 accessions of Asian cultivated rice and 111 accessions of common wild rice in China were selected to examine the relationship between O. sativa and O. rufipogon and thereby infer the domestication and evolution of O. sativa in China through sequence analyses of six gene regions, trnC-ycf6 in chloroplast genomes, cox3 in mitochondrial genomes and ITS, Ehd1, Waxy, Hd1 in nuclear genomes. The results indicated that the two subspecies of O. sativa (indica and japonica) were domesticated independently from different populations of O. rufipogon with gene flow occurring later from japonica to indica; Southern China was the genetic diversity centre of O. rufipogon, and the Pearl River basin near the Tropic of Cancer was the domestication centre of O. sativa in China.
22899054	Modulating the root elongation by phosphate/nitrogen starvation in an OsGLU3 dependant way in rice.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Previously, we showed that OsGLU3, a β-1,4-endoglucanase, can affect the cellulose synthesis for root elongation in rice. And the phosphate starvation induced root elongation in rice depends on the function of OsGLU3. Here, we further showed that OsGLU3 is also dispensable for nitrogen starvation induced root elongation in rice.
22990444	Intracellular localization and physiological function of a rice Ca²⁺-permeable channel OsTPC1.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Two-pore channels (TPCs) are cation channels with a voltage-sensor domain conserved in plants and animals. Rice OsTPC1 is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca²⁺-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride. In contrast, Arabidopsis AtTPC1 is localized to the vacuolar membrane (VM). To gain further insights into the intracellular localization of OsTPC1, we stably expressed OsTPC1-GFP in tobacco BY-2 cells. Confocal imaging and membrane fractionation revealed that, unlike in rice cells, the majority of OsTPC1-GFP fusion protein was targeted to the VM in tobacco BY-2 cells. Intracellular localization and functions of the plant TPC family is discussed.
22956125	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice.	2013	Planta	In vascular plants, the regulation of stem cell niche determines development of aerial shoot which consists of stems and lateral organs. Intercalary meristem (IM) controls internode elongation in rice and other grasses, however little attention has been paid to the underlying mechanism of stem cell maintenance. Here, we investigated the stem development in rice and showed that the Shortened Uppermost Internode 1 (SUI1) family of genes are pivotal for development of rice stems. We demonstrated that SUI-family genes regulate the development of IM for internode elongation and also the cell expansion of the panicle stem rachis in rice. The SUI-family genes encoded base-exchange types of phosphatidylserine synthases (PSSs), which possessed enzymatic activity in a yeast complementary assay. Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired. Furthermore, genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that overexpression and RNA knockdown of SUI-family genes affected downstream gene expression related to phospholipid metabolic pathways. Moreover, using Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry, we analyzed PS contents in different genetic backgrounds of rice and showed that the quantity of very long chain fatty acids PS is affected by transgene of SUI-family genes. Our study reveals a new mechanism conveyed by the SUI1 pathway and provides evidence to link lipid metabolism with plant stem cell maintenance.
22933119	Characterization of Osmads6-5, a null allele, reveals that OsMADS6 is a critical regulator for early flower development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Plant Mol Biol	AGL6-clade genes are a subfamily of MADS-box genes and preferentially expressed in floral organs. OsMADS6 and OsMADS17 are two AGL6-like genes in rice. OsMADS17 has been shown to play a minor role in floral development and appears to result from a duplication of OsMADS6. OsMADS6 was initially named as MFO1 for mosaic floral organs based on its moderate mutant phenotypes. So far, four moderate or weak mutant alleles of OsMADS6 have been described, providing valuable insights into its role in flower development. Here, we report a null allele of OsMADS6 (Osmads6-5), which exhibited a strong mutant phenotype in spikelet without affecting vegetative traits, causing all floral organs except lemma homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs (LLOs) as well as an indeterminate floral meristem, thus resulting in a mutant floret consisting of reiterating whorls of lemma and LLOs. In consistently, over-expression of OsMADS6 led to additional lodicule-, stamen- and carpel-like organs. Expression analysis showed that OsMADS6 controls the formation of the incipient primordia of lodicule, stamen and carpel via regulating the expression of class B, C and SEP-like MADS-box genes. Taken together, our results revealed that OsMADS6 acts as a critical regulator for early flower development in rice and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of OsMADS6.
22985247	Abscisic acid interacts antagonistically with classical defense pathways in rice-migratory nematode interaction.	2012	New Phytol	Studies involving plant-nematode interactions provide an opportunity to unravel plant defense signaling in root tissues. In this study, we have characterized the roles of salicylate (SA), jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA) in plant defense against the migratory nematode Hirschmanniella oryzae in the monocot model plant rice (Oryza sativa). Experiments with exogenous hormone applications, biosynthesis inhibition and mutant/transgenic lines were executed to test the effect on H. oryzae parasitism in rice roots. Our results demonstrate that an intact ET, JA and SA biosynthesis pathway is a prerequisite for defense against H. oryzae. By contrast, exogenous ABA treatment drastically compromised the rice defense towards this nematode. Gene expression analyses using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrate that the disease-inducing effect of ABA is likely to be the result of an antagonistic interaction between this hormone and the SA/JA/ET-dependent basal defense system. Collectively, in rice defense against H. oryzae, at least three pathways, namely SA, JA and ET, are important, while ABA plays a negative role in defense. Our results suggest that the balance of ABA and SA/JA/ET signaling is an important determinant for the outcome of the rice-H. oryzae interaction.
23001338	Fine mapping and characterization of BPH27, a brown planthopper resistance gene from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.).	2013	Theor Appl Genet	The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH) is one of the most serious rice pests worldwide. Growing resistant varieties is the most effective way to manage this insect, and wild rice species are a valuable source of resistance genes for developing resistant cultivars. BPH27 derived from an accession of Guangxi wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff. (Accession no. 2183, hereafter named GX2183), was primarily mapped to a 17-cM region on the long arm of the chromosome four. In this study, fine mapping of BPH27 was conducted using two BC(1)F(2) populations derived from introgression lines of GX2183. Insect resistance was evaluated in the BC(1)F(2) populations with 6,010 individual offsprings, and 346 resistance extremes were obtained and employed for fine mapping of BPH27. High-resolution linkage analysis defined the BPH27 locus to an 86.3-kb region in Nipponbare. Regarding the sequence information of rice cultivars, Nipponbare and 93-11, all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in the fine-mapping region have been annotated as 11 types of proteins, and three ORFs encode disease-related proteins. Moreover, the average BPH numbers showed significant differences in 96-120 h after release in comparisons between the preliminary near-isogenic lines (pre-NILs, lines harboring resistance genes) and BaiR54. BPH growth and development were inhibited and survival rates were lower in the pre-NIL plants compared with the recurrent parent BaiR54. The pre-NIL exhibited 50.7% reductions in population growth rates (PGR) compared to BaiR54. The new development in fine mapping of BPH27 will facilitate the efforts to clone this important resistant gene and to use it in BPH-resistance rice breeding.
22899082	Rice Crinkly4 receptor-like kinase positively regulates culm elongation and amino acid K532 is not essential for its kinase activity.	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in multiple aspects of plant growth and development. As a member of the TNFR-like RLK subfamily, rice Crinkly4 (OsCR4) functions mainly in epidermal cell differentiation in many organs. Here we show that in addition to its essential role in epidermal cell differentiation in the palea and lemma, OsCR4 positively regulates rice culm elongation, similar to maize CR4. Although OsCR4 is an active kinase, like CR4 in maize and ACR4 in Arabidopsis, the conserved amino acid K532 in OsCR4 is not essential for its kinase activity in vitro. Whether other conserved amino acids are required for its kinase activity and the relationship between its activity and function in plant development remain to be investigated.
22955680	Overexpression of maize anthocyanin regulatory gene Lc affects rice fertility.	2013	Biotechnol Lett	Seventeen independent transgenic rice plants with the maize anthocyanin regulatory gene Lc under control of the CaMV 35S promoter were obtained and verified by molecular identification. Ten plants showed red spikelets during early development of florets, and the degenerate florets were still red after heading. Additionally, these plants exhibited intense pigmentation on the surface of the anther and the bottom of the ovary. They were unable to properly bloom and were completely sterile. Following pollination with normal pollen, these plants yielded red caryopses but did not mature normally. QRT-PCR analysis indicated that mRNA accumulation of the CHS-like gene encoding a chalcone synthase-related protein was increased significantly in the sterile plant. This is the first report to suggest that upregulation of the CHS gene expression may result in rice sterility and affect the normal development of rice seeds.
22945626	Dramatic genotypic difference in, and effect of genetic crossing on, tissue culture-induced mobility of retrotransposon Tos17 in rice.	2012	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE : We show for the first time that intraspecific crossing may impact mobility of the prominent endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 under tissue culture conditions in rice. Tos17, an endogenous copia retrotransposon of rice, is transpositionally active in tissue culture. To study whether there exists fundamental genotypic difference in the tissue culture-induced mobility of Tos17, and if so, whether the difference is under genetic and/or epigenetic control, we conducted this investigation. We show that dramatic difference in tissue culture-induced Tos17 mobility exists among different rice pure-line cultivars sharing the same maternal parent: of the three lines studied that harbor Tos17, two showed mobilization of Tos17, which accrued in proportion to subculture duration, while the third line showed total quiescence (immobility) of the element and the fourth line did not contain the element. In reciprocal F1 hybrids between Tos17-mobile and -immobile (or absence) parental lines, immobility was dominant over mobility. In reciprocal F1 hybrids between both Tos17-mobile parental lines, an additive or synergistic effect on mobility of the element was noticed. In both types of reciprocal F1 hybrids, clear difference in the extent of Tos17 mobility was noted between crossing directions. Given that all lines share the same maternal parent, this observation indicates the existence of epigenetic parent-of-origin effect. We conclude that the tissue culture-induced mobility of Tos17 in rice is under complex genetic and epigenetic control, which can be either enhanced or repressed by intraspecific genetic crossing.
22996334	Genome-wide analysis and expression profiling of half-size ABC protein subgroup G in rice in response to abiotic stress and phytohormone treatments.	2012	Mol Genet Genomics	The roles of the proteins encoded by half-size adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subgroup G (ABCG) genes in abiotic stress responses are starting to be established in the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana. In the monocot model rice, the functions of most half-size ABCG proteins in abiotic stress responses are unknown. Rcn1/OsABCG5 is an essential transporter for growth and development under abiotic stress, but its molecular function remains largely unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of all 30 half-size ABCG genes in rice, including their gene structures, phylogeny, chromosome locations, and conserved motifs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the half-size OsABCG proteins were divided to four classes. All seven rice intronless genes, including Rcn1/OsABCG5, were in Class III, like the 12 intronless ABCG genes of Arabidopsis. The EST and FL-cDNA databases provided expression information for 25 OsABCG genes. Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that seven OsABCG genes were up-regulated in seedlings, shoots or roots following treatments with abiotic stresses (6, 17, 42 °C, NaCl, or mannitol) and abscisic acid. Another 15 OsABCG genes were up-regulated under at least one of the abiotic stress conditions and other phytohormones besides abscisic acid. Hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles showed that expression of the OsABCG genes could be classified into four clusters. The Rcn1/OsABCG5 cluster was up-regulated by abscisic acid and included OsABCG2, 3, 13, and 27. The present study will provide a useful reference for further functional analysis of the ABCGs in monocots.
23007553	Characterization of the stress-inducible OsNCED3 promoter in different transgenic rice organs and over three homozygous generations.	2013	Planta	To be effective in crop biotechnology applications, gene promoters need to be stably active over sequential generations in a population of single-copy transgenic lines. Most of the stress-inducible promoters characterized in plants thus far have been analyzed at early (T₀, T₁ or T₂) generations and/or by testing only a small number of transgenic lines. In our current study, we report our analysis of OsNCED3, a stress-inducible rice promoter involved in ABA biosynthesis, in various organs and tissues of transgenic rice plants over the T(2-4) homozygous generations. The transgene copy numbers in the lines harboring the OsNCED3:gfp construct were determined and six single- and two double-copy transgenic lines were analyzed for promoter activity in comparison with the Wsi18, a stress-inducible promoter previously characterized. The exogenous promoter activities were found to be significantly enhanced in the roots and leaves, whereas zero or low levels of activity were evident in grains and flowers, under drought and high-salinity conditions. The highest induction levels of gfp transcripts in the OsNCED3:gfp plants upon drought treatments were 161- and 93-fold in leaves and roots, respectively, and these levels were comparable with those of gfp transcripts in the Wsi18:gfp plants. A comparison of the promoter activities between the T₂-T₄ plants revealed that comparable activity levels were maintained over these three homozygous generations with no evidence of silencing. Thus, our results provide the OsNCED3 promoter that is stress-inducible in a whole rice plant except for in the aleurones and endosperm and stably active over three generations.
23116677	Gene expression analysis in response to low and high temperature and oxidative stresses in rice: combination of stresses evokes different transcriptional changes as against stresses applied individually.	2012	Plant Sci	Transcript expression profiles of rice seedlings were analyzed in response to (a) prior exposure with oxidative stress followed by heat or cold stress and (b) simultaneous exposure to oxidative stress along with heat stress or cold stress. The numbers of genes differentially regulated during stress combination of cold and oxidative stress as well as heat and oxidative stress treatments were higher when compared with the number of genes differentially regulated in response to individual stress conditions. A large number of transcript changes were noted unique to the stress combination mode as compared with when individual stresses were applied. Specific differences in the transcript expression profiles of OsHsf and OsClp gene family members were noted during combination of stresses as against individual stresses. For instance, OsHsf26 induction was specific to stress combinations, while OsHsfA2a, OsHsfA2f, and OsHsfA3 transcript levels were additively affected during combination of stresses. Unique promoter models and transcription factor binding sites (i.e. P$KNOX3_01, P$OSBZ8_Q6) were noted in the promoters of differentially regulated genes during combination of stresses. It is proposed that stress combinations represent a novel state of abiotic stresses for rice seedlings that might involve a different type of molecular response.
22927256	Systemic effects of thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole seed treatments on adult Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in rice.	2013	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: Feeding assays using adult rice water weevils and foliage of plants treated as seeds with chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam at different rates were conducted to evaluate the systemic adulticidal and feeding effects. Dose-mortality relationships were determined for thiamethoxam seed treatments by combining leaf area lost due to feeding and insecticide residues analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Changes in adulticidal activity of thiamethoxam were also investigated by contrasting adult mortalities at the 5-6-leaf and tillering stages of rice.

RESULTS: Adult weevil mortalities and leaf consumption rates on foliage were affected in thiamethoxam but not in chlorantraniliprole treatments when rice was at the 6-7-leaf stage. The LD(50) for weevils feeding on thiamethoxam-treated rice at the 2-3-leaf stage was 447 pg insecticide weevil(-1) (95% CL: 25-830 pg weevil(-1)) but was lower (142 pg weevil(-1); 95% CL: 102-180 pg weevil(-1)) in experiments with 3-4-leaf-stage plants. Mortalities on leaves from 5-6-leaf-stage plants were consistently higher than on leaves from tillering plants. Thiamethoxam residues measured by ELISA increased with seed treatment rate and differed between plant stages.

CONCLUSION: The LD(50) values developed in this study are the first values for leaf-feeding insects on foliage of plants treated as seeds with thiamethoxam. The attrition of adulticidal activity of thiamethoxam in foliage of older plants may help to explain the reduced effectiveness of seed treatments against rice water larvae that is seen at later stages of rice growth in field studies. The differential activity of these two seed treatments on adults suggests that adult mortality contributes to the field efficacy of thiamethoxam but not to that of chlorantraniliprole.
22939271	Barnyard grass stress up regulates the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in allelopathic rice.	2012	J Plant Physiol	Allelopathic rice cultivar PI312777 (PI) and non-allelopathic rice cultivar Lemont (Le) were mixed with barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli L., BYG) at various ratios (rice:weed ratios of 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1) in hydroponic cultures. The expression of four genes, i.e. phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase (F5H), and caffeic acid O-methyltransferases (COMT), which are involved in the biosynthesis of the phenolic compounds in rice, were evaluated by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The contents of phenolic compounds in leaves, roots, and culture solutions of the two rice cultivars were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that all of the four genes were up-regulated in leaves and roots of the allelopathic rice PI at all rice:weed ratios. However, three of the four genes, C4H, F5H, and COMT, were down-regulated in the leaves and roots of the non-allelopathic rice Le. The degree to which PAL was up-regulated in leaves and roots was much higher in PI than in Le. The contents of phenolic compounds in PI leaves, roots, and culture solutions were higher than that in Le leaves, roots, and culture solutions. The higher expression of the genes involved in the phenylpropanoid metabolism and the higher contents of phenolic compounds in PI are consistent with the higher inhibitory rates of PI on BYG. These results indicate that the PAL gene in PI is more sensitive to BYG stress than in Le, and barnyard grass up regulates the biosynthesis of phenolic compound in allelopathic rice.
22868211	Proteomic analysis of rice anthers under salt stress.	2012	Plant Physiol Biochem	Salinity is a major factor that limits rice production worldwide. Rice is considered generally to be sensitive to salt stress during the reproductive stage. To determine the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance at the reproductive stage, anther proteomic patterns for two contrasting rice genotypes IR64 (salt sensitive) and Cheriviruppu (salt tolerant) under salt stress were compared. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and salt stress (100 mM NaCl) was imposed at the booting stage. Anther samples were collected from control and salt-treated plants at the anthesis stage. The Na(+)/K(+) ratio in IR64 anthers under salt stress was >1.7 times greater than that under control conditions, whereas no significant change was observed in Cheriviruppu. We also observed an 83% reduction in IR64 pollen viability, whereas this reduction was only 23% in Cheriviruppu. Of 454 protein spots detected reproducibly on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, 38 showed significant changes in at least one genotype in response to stress. Using Mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) analysis, we identified 18 protein spots that were involved in several processes that might increase plant adaptation to salt stress, such as carbohydrate/energy metabolism, anther wall remodelling and metabolism, and protein synthesis and assembly. Three isoforms of fructokinase-2 were upregulated only in Cheriviruppu under salt stress. This upregulation might result in increased starch content in pollen, which would support pollen growth and development under salt stress. The results also suggested that anther and pollen wall remodelling/metabolism proteins contribute to the tolerance of rice to salt stress.
23226080	Genetic variation of germination cold tolerance in Japanese rice germplasm.	2012	Breed Sci	Low temperatures at the initial stages of rice development prevent fast germination and seedling establishment and may cause significant productivity losses. In order to develop rice cultivars exhibiting cold tolerance, it is necessary to investigate genetic resources, providing basic knowledge to allow the introduction of genes involved in low temperature germination ability from accessions into elite cultivars. Japanese rice accessions were evaluated at the germination under two conditions: 13°C for 28 days (cold stress) and 28°C for seven days (optimal temperature). The traits studied were coleoptile and radicle length under optimal temperature, coleoptile and radicle length under cold and percentage of the reduction in coleptile and radicle length due to low temperature. Among the accessions studied, genetic variation for traits related to germination under low temperatures was observed and accessions exhibiting adequate performance for all investigated traits were identified. The use of multivariate analysis allowed the identification of the genotypes displaying cold tolerance by smaller reductions in coleoptile and radicle lenght in the presence of cold and high vigour, by higher coleoptile and radicle growth under cold.

24018854	Deficiency of phytochrome B alleviates chilling-induced photoinhibition in rice.	2013	Am J Bot	UNLABELLED: OrderedDict([('@Label', 'UNLABELLED')])

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Food crops of tropical origins, such as rice, are often cultivated in areas with suboptimal temperature regimes. The rice phytochrome B-deficient mutant (phyB) is tolerant of chilling temperatures compared with the wild type (WT) under low irradiance, and unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs) of membrane lipids have been shown to play an important role in chilling resistance. However, the relationship between phytochrome B and membrane lipids has not been empirically investigated. •

METHODS: We assessed various photosynthesis indexes in phyB and WT rice: chlorophyll content, maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII), the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (ΦPSII), the percentage of oxidizable P700 (P700), nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), and the de-epoxidized ratio of xanthophyll cycle (A+Z)/(V+A+Z). We also analyzed the ultrastructure and fatty acid desaturases (FADs) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) genes of the chloroplasts using transmission electron microscopy and real-time PCR. •

RESULTS: After a chilling treatment of 24 h, chloroplast damage and USFA content reduction were more severe in the WT than in the phyB mutant. Genes involved in the synthesis of USFAs in membranes such as FADs and GPAT were more stable in phyB than in WT. Chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, ΦPSII, and P700 decreased more slowly under chilling stress and recovered more rapidly under optimal conditions in phyB than in WT. The (A+Z)/(V+A+Z) and NPQ increased more rapidly in phyB than in the WT after 24 h of chilling treatment. •

CONCLUSIONS: Phytochrome B deficiency in rice with more stabilized chloroplast structure and higher USFA content in membrane lipids could alleviate chilling-induced photoinhibition.
23999092	Demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA-mediated targeted gene modification in Arabidopsis, tobacco, sorghum and rice.	2013	Nucleic Acids Res	The type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes and its simplified derivative, the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, have emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here, we describe adaptations of these systems leading to successful expression of the Cas9/sgRNA system in two dicot plant species, Arabidopsis and tobacco, and two monocot crop species, rice and sorghum. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used for delivery of genes encoding Cas9, sgRNA and a non-fuctional, mutant green fluorescence protein (GFP) to Arabidopsis and tobacco. The mutant GFP gene contained target sites in its 5' coding regions that were successfully cleaved by a CAS9/sgRNA complex that, along with error-prone DNA repair, resulted in creation of functional GFP genes. DNA sequencing confirmed Cas9/sgRNA-mediated mutagenesis at the target site. Rice protoplast cells transformed with Cas9/sgRNA constructs targeting the promoter region of the bacterial blight susceptibility genes, OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11, were confirmed by DNA sequencing to contain mutated DNA sequences at the target sites. Successful demonstration of the Cas9/sgRNA system in model plant and crop species bodes well for its near-term use as a facile and powerful means of plant genetic engineering for scientific and agricultural applications.
24057602	Bt rice expressing Cry2Aa does not cause direct detrimental effects on larvae of Chrysoperla sinica.	2013	Ecotoxicology	To assess the potential effects of Cry2Aa-expressing insect-resistant Bt rice on Chrysoperla sinica larvae, we conducted two tritrophic bioassays using a non-target (Laodelphax striatellus) and a target herbivore (Chilo suppressalis) as prey. None of the tested life-table parameters of C. sinica did differ when fed with L. striatellus nymphs reared on either Bt or control rice plants. Similarly, C. sinica larval survival and development were not affected when fed C. suppressalis larvae that were reared on Cry2Aa-contained artificial diet compared to those fed control diet. However, the 7-day larval weight was significantly decreased in the Bt treatment and none of the C. sinica larvae developed to the adult stage. To clarify whether the observed effects were due to the direct toxicity of Cry2Aa or prey-quality mediated, we conducted a dietary exposure assay in which the toxicity of Cry2Aa to C. sinica larvae was tested. Potassium arsenate (PA) was included as a positive control. None of the tested life-table parameters of C. sinica was adversely affected when fed Cry2Aa at 500 μg/ml sucrose solution. In contrast, C. sinica larvae were adversely affected by feeding on sucrose solution containing PA. In the feeding assays, exposure of C. sinica larvae to Cry2Aa was confirmed by ELISA. Our results demonstrate that C. sinica larvae are not sensitive to Cry2Aa at concentrations exceeding the levels that the larvae may encounter in Bt rice fields. Consequently the detrimental effects observed in the tritrophic studies using Bt rice-fed C. suppressalis as prey can be attributed to the decreased prey quality due to the sensitivity of C. suppressalis larvae to Cry2Aa.
24130448	Cloning and characterization of endo-β-1,4-glucanase genes in the common wheat line three pistils.	2013	Genet Mol Biol	In this work, we report the cloning and characterization of endo-β-1,4-glucanase (EGase) genes (TaEG) in the common wheat line three pistils. Three TaEG homoeologous genes (TaEG-4A, TaEG-4B and TaEG-4D) were isolated and found to be located on chromosomes 4AL, 4BS and 4DS, respectively. The three genes showed high conservation of their coding nucleotide sequences and 3 untranslated region. The putative TaEG protein had a molecular mass of 69 kDa, a theoretical pI of 9.39 and a transmembrane domain of 74-96 amino acids in the N-terminus that anchored the protein to the membrane. The genome sequences of TaEG-4A, TaEG-4B and TaEG-4D contained six exons and five introns. All of the introns, except for intron IV, varied in length and sequence composition. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaEG was most closely related to rice (Oryza sativa) OsGLU1. The TaEG transcript levels increased significantly during the subsidiary pistil primordium differentiation phase (spike size ∼7-10 mm) in Chuanmai 28 TP (CM28TP). These data provide a basis for future research into the function of TaEG and offer insights into the molecular mechanism of the three pistils mutation in wheat.
24085445	Fine mapping and characterization of a novel dwarf and narrow-leaf mutant dnl1 in rice.	2013	Genet Mol Res	Plant height is one of the most important agronomic traits of rice (Oryza sativa). Dwarf mutants are ideal materials for research on the mechanisms of regulation of rice plant height. We examined a new dwarf and narrow-leaf mutant dnl1. Phenotypic analysis showed that the dnl1 mutant has a thinner culm and more tillers, but the number of grains per panicle, the seed setting rate and the grain weight of dnl1 mutant were found to be significantly lower than in the wild-type. Based on scanning electron microscopic observations, the number of cells in the y-axis in internodes was significantly lower than in the wild-type. In phytohormone induction experiments, dnl1 was gibberellic acid-insensitive. The expression of some genes involved in the gibberellins metabolic pathways was affected in the dnl1 mutant, based on the real-time PCR analysis, suggesting that the dnl1 gene likely plays a role in gibberellin metabolic pathways. Genetic analysis showed that the dwarf and narrow leaf phenotype is controlled by a novel single recessive gene, here referred to as the dwarf and narrow leaf 1 (dnl1), which is located within the region between markers Ind12-11 and RM8214 on the short arm of chromosome 12. By means of fine-mapping strategy, the dnl1 gene was localized within an interval of 285.75 kb physical distance. These results will be useful for dnl1 gene cloning and to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of growth and development of rice.
24056187	Accumulation of total mercury and methylmercury in rice plants collected from different mining areas in China.	2014	Environ Pollut	A total of 155 rice plants were collected from ten mining areas in three provinces of China (Hunan, Guizhou and Guangdong), where most of mercury (Hg) mining takes place in China. During the harvest season, whole rice plants were sampled and divided into root, stalk & leaf, husk and seed (brown rice), together with soil from root zone. Although the degree of Hg contamination varied significantly among different mining areas, rice seed showed the highest ability for methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. Both concentrations of total mercury (THg) and MeHg in rice plants were significantly correlated with Hg levels in soil, indicating soil is still an important source for both inorganic mercury (IHg) and MeHg in rice plants. The obvious discrepancy between the distribution patterns of THg and MeHg reflected different pathways of IHg and MeHg accumulation. Water soluble Hg may play more important role in MeHg accumulation in rice plants.
24115565	Optimizing rice yields while minimizing yield-scaled global warming potential.	2014	Glob Chang Biol	To meet growing global food demand with limited land and reduced environmental impact, agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are increasingly evaluated with respect to crop productivity, i.e., on a yield-scaled as opposed to area basis. Here, we compiled available field data on CH4 and N2 O emissions from rice production systems to test the hypothesis that in response to fertilizer nitrogen (N) addition, yield-scaled global warming potential (GWP) will be minimized at N rates that maximize yields. Within each study, yield N surplus was calculated to estimate deficit or excess N application rates with respect to the optimal N rate (defined as the N rate at which maximum yield was achieved). Relationships between yield N surplus and GHG emissions were assessed using linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models. Results indicate that yields increased in response to increasing N surplus when moving from deficit to optimal N rates. At N rates contributing to a yield N surplus, N2 O and yield-scaled N2 O emissions increased exponentially. In contrast, CH4 emissions were not impacted by N inputs. Accordingly, yield-scaled CH4 emissions decreased with N addition. Overall, yield-scaled GWP was minimized at optimal N rates, decreasing by 21% compared to treatments without N addition. These results are unique compared to aerobic cropping systems in which N2 O emissions are the primary contributor to GWP, meaning yield-scaled GWP may not necessarily decrease for aerobic crops when yields are optimized by N fertilizer addition. Balancing gains in agricultural productivity with climate change concerns, this work supports the concept that high rice yields can be achieved with minimal yield-scaled GWP through optimal N application rates. Moreover, additional improvements in N use efficiency may further reduce yield-scaled GWP, thereby strengthening the economic and environmental sustainability of rice systems.
24078602	Increases in both acute and chronic temperature potentiate tocotrienol concentrations in wild barley at 'Evolution Canyon'.	2013	Chem Biodivers	Biosynthesis of tocols (vitamin E isoforms) is linked to response to temperature in plants. 'Evolution Canyon', an ecogeographical microcosm extending over an average of 200 meters (range 100-400) wide area in the Carmel Mountains of northern Israel, has been suggested as a model for studying global warming. Both domestic (Hordeum vulgare) and wild (Hordeum spontaneum) barley compared with wheat, oat, corn, rice, and rye show high tocotrienol/tocopherol ratios. Therefore, we hypothesized that tocol distribution might change in response to global warming. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherol, and α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienol concentrations were measured in wild barley (H. spontaneum) seeds harvested from the xeric (African) and mesic (European) slopes of Evolution Canyon over a six-year period from 2005-2011. Additionally, we examined seeds from areas contiguous to and distant from the part of the Canyon severely burned during the Carmel Fire of December 2010. Increased α-tocotrienol (p<0.01) was correlated with 1) temperature increases, 2) to the hotter 'African' slope in contrast to the cooler 'European' slope, and 3) to propinquity to the fire. The study illustrates the role of α-tocotrienol in both chronic and acute temperature adaptation in wild barley and suggests future research into thermoregulatory mechanisms in plants.

24041758	Protective effects of tocotrienols against lipid-induced nephropathy in experimental type-2 diabetic rats by modulation in TGF-β expression.	2013	Toxicol Appl Pharmacol	Dyslipidemia is common in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and is considered a risk factor for the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia act synergistically to induce renal injury. The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of tocotrienols as tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) extracted from palm (PO) and rice bran oils (RBO) against lipid induced nephropathy in type-2 diabetic rats and its probable molecular mechanism. Male Wistar rats (175-200 g) were divided into four groups. The first group served as diabetic control, while the second and third groups received PO-TRF and RBO-TRF, respectively by gavage over a period of sixteen weeks post-induction of diabetes. The fourth group comprised of age-matched rats that served as normal control. The effects of TRF on serum lipid profile, oxidative stress markers, expression of TGF-β, fibronectin and collagen type IV were analyzed in the kidney of diabetic rats. Treatment with PO-TRF and RBO-TRF significantly improved glycemic status, serum lipid profile and renal function in type-2 diabetic rats. In addition, TRF supplementation down-regulated the expression of TGF-β, fibronectin and collagen type IV in the kidney of diabetic rats. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a critical role in progression of DN, but its modulation by tocotrienols in DN remains unexplored. TRF ameliorated lipid induced nephropathy in type-2 diabetes by its hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities as well as by modulation of TGF-β to prevent increased expression of collagen type IV and fibrinogen. We finally propose a mechanism for the expression of molecular markers that are significant in the events leading to diabetic nephropathy and its modulation by tocotrienols/TRF.
24039439	Effects of combination therapy with mitiglinide and voglibose on postprandial plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	2013	Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes	Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk from cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality as compared with healthy individuals. An association between the postprandial metabolic state and atherogenesis has been observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. In the Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM), treatment with an α-glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI) in patients with impaired glucose tolerance not only reduced the rate of conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but was also associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. These results suggested the importance of treating postprandial hyperglycemia in the early stages of T2DM. Glinides are rapid and short-acting insulin secretagogues that bind to the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic β-cells to facilitate rapid insulin secretion, restore postprandial early insulin secretion, and reduce the postprandial glucose spike. Moreover, α-GIs reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin secretion by delaying the digestion of carbohydrates and polysaccharides in the small intestine. Then, both glinides and α-GI have beneficial effects for treating patients with T2DM and impaired glucose tolerance. Considering the ameliorating effects of these drugs on postprandial metabolic disorders, combinations of glinides and α-GI might constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for managing patients with T2DM, and also appear to be suitable for Japanese people, who consume more carbohydrates, such as polished rice, than Caucasians. It has recently been reported that combined use of mitiglinide and voglibose reduces postprandial insulin secretion and blunts diurnal glycemic changes in T2DM patients. This therapy can thus be regarded as being suitable for achieving strict postprandial glycemic control. In this report, we outline the effects of this combination therapy on postprandial plasma glucose and assess its safety.
24036507	Cloning, functional characterization, and expression profiles of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene from the Asiatic rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	None	Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol	NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is one of the most important components of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. It catalyzes electron transfer from NADPH to all known P450s, thus plays central roles not only in the metabolism of exogenous xenobiotics but also in the regulation of endogenous hormones in insects. In this study, a full-length cDNA encoding of a CPR (named CsCPR) was isolated from the Asiatic rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The cDNA contains a 2061 bp open reading frame, which encodes an enzyme of 686 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 77.6 kDa. The deduced peptide has hallmarks of typical CPR, including an N-terminal membrane anchor and the FMN, FAD and NADPH binding domains. The N-terminal-truncated protein fused with a 6 × His·tag was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells and purified, specific activity and the Km values of the recombinant enzyme were determined. Tissue- and developmental stage-dependent expression of CsCPR mRNA was investigated by real-time quantitative PCR. The CsCPR mRNA was noticeably expressed in the digestive, metabolic, and olfactory organs of the larvae and adults of C. suppressalis. Our initial results would provide valuable information for further study on the interactions between CPR and cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
24086146	Genome-wide analysis of ZmDREB genes and their association with natural variation in drought tolerance at seedling stage of Zea mays L.	2013	PLoS Genet	The worldwide production of maize (Zea mays L.) is frequently impacted by water scarcity and as a result, increased drought tolerance is a priority target in maize breeding programs. While DREB transcription factors have been demonstrated to play a central role in desiccation tolerance, whether or not natural sequence variations in these genes are associated with the phenotypic variability of this trait is largely unknown. In the present study, eighteen ZmDREB genes present in the maize B73 genome were cloned and systematically analyzed to determine their phylogenetic relationship, synteny with rice, maize and sorghum genomes; pattern of drought-responsive gene expression, and protein transactivation activity. Importantly, the association between the nucleic acid variation of each ZmDREB gene with drought tolerance was evaluated using a diverse population of maize consisting of 368 varieties from tropical and temperate regions. A significant association between the genetic variation of ZmDREB2.7 and drought tolerance at seedling stage was identified. Further analysis found that the DNA polymorphisms in the promoter region of ZmDREB2.7, but not the protein coding region itself, was associated with different levels of drought tolerance among maize varieties, likely due to distinct patterns of gene expression in response to drought stress. In vitro, protein-DNA binding assay demonstrated that ZmDREB2.7 protein could specifically interact with the target DNA sequences. The transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ZmDREB2.7 displayed enhanced tolerance to drought stress. Moreover, a favorable allele of ZmDREB2.7, identified in the drought-tolerant maize varieties, was effective in imparting plant tolerance to drought stress. Based upon these findings, we conclude that natural variation in the promoter of ZmDREB2.7 contributes to maize drought tolerance, and that the gene and its favorable allele may be an important genetic resource for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in maize.
24066067	Potential of global cropland phytolith carbon sink from optimization of cropping system and fertilization.	2013	PLoS One	The occlusion of carbon (C) by phytoliths, the recalcitrant silicified structures deposited within plant tissues, is an important persistent C sink mechanism for croplands and other grass-dominated ecosystems. By constructing a silica content-phytolith content transfer function and calculating the magnitude of phytolith C sink in global croplands with relevant crop production data, this study investigated the present and potential of phytolith C sinks in global croplands and its contribution to the cropland C balance to understand the cropland C cycle and enhance long-term C sequestration in croplands. Our results indicate that the phytolith sink annually sequesters 26.35 ± 10.22 Tg of carbon dioxide (CO2) and may contribute 40 ± 18% of the global net cropland soil C sink for 1961-2100. Rice (25%), wheat (19%) and maize (23%) are the dominant contributing crop species to this phytolith C sink. Continentally, the main contributors are Asia (49%), North America (17%) and Europe (16%). The sink has tripled since 1961, mainly due to fertilizer application and irrigation. Cropland phytolith C sinks may be further enhanced by adopting cropland management practices such as optimization of cropping system and fertilization.
24002549	Structure and expression of barley starch phosphorylase genes.	2013	Planta	The function of starch phosphorylase has long been debated on the regulation of starch metabolism during the growth and development of plants. In this study, we isolated starch phosphorylase genes (Pho1 and Pho2) from barley, characterized their gene and protein structures, predicated their promoter's cis-elements and analyzed expression patterns. Multiple alignments of these genes showed that (1) both Pho1 and Pho2 genes possess 15 exons and 14 introns in all but three of the species analyzed, Aegilops tauschii (for Pho1 which contains 16 exons and 15 introns), potato (for Pho1b which contains 14 exons and 13 introns), and Triticum uraru (for Pho2 which contains 15 exons and 14 introns); (2) the exon-intron junctions of Pho1 and Pho2 flanking the ligand-binding sites are more conservative than the other regions. Analysis of protein sequences revealed that Pho1 and Pho2 were highly homologous except for two regions, the N terminal domain and the L78 insertion region. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that Pho2 is mainly expressed in germinating seeds, and the expression of Pho1 is similar to that of starch synthesis genes during seed development in barley. Microarray-based analysis indicated that the accumulation of Pho1 or Pho2 transcripts exhibited uniform pattern both in various tissues and various stages of seed development among species of barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. Pho1 of barley was significantly down-regulated under cold and drought treatments, and up-regulated under stem rust infection. Pho2 exhibited similar expression to Pho1 in barley. However, significant difference in expression was not detected for either Pho1 or Pho2 under any of the investigated abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis, significant down-regulation was detected for Pho1 (PHS1) under abscisic acid (ABA) and for Pho2 (PHS2) under cold, salt, and ABA. Our results provide valuable information to genetically manipulate phosphorylase genes and to further elucidate their regulatory mechanism in the starch biosynthetic pathway.
24015925	Functional characterization of a serine-threonine protein kinase from Bambusa balcooa that implicates in cellulose overproduction and superior quality fiber formation.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Molecular markers allow rapid identification of biologically important germplasm/s having desired character. Previously we have reported a genotype specific molecular marker, Balco1128 [GenBank ID EU258678] of Bambusa balcooa containing an ORF (375 bp) having high similarity with receptor like cytoplasmic kinase of Arabidopsis and Oryza. Balco1128 was found to be associated only with bamboo genotypes endowed with high cellulose and low lignin contents of fibers. Under the above backdrop, it was necessitated to characterize this genetic marker for better understanding of its biological significance in context of superior quality fiber development.

RESULTS: The full length cDNA (3342 bp) of BbKst, a serine-threonine protein kinase was isolated from B. balcooa comprising of six LRR domains at the N-terminal end and a kinase domain at the C-terminal end. Bacteria-expressed BbKst-kinase domain (3339 bp long) showed Mg(2+) dependent kinase activity at pH 7.0, 28°C. Bioinformatics study followed by phospho-amino analysis further confirmed that BbKst-kinase belongs to the serine/threonine protein kinase family. Transcript analysis of the BbKst gene following RNA slot blot hybridization and qPCR revealed higher expression of BbKst during initiation and elongation stages of fiber development. Tissue specific expression studies showed much higher expression of BbKst transcript in stems and internodes of B. balcooa than in leaves and rhizomes. Southern analysis revealed single copy insertion of BbKst in most of the Agrobacterium mediated transgenic tobacco plants. Real-time PCR detected 150-200 fold enhanced expression of BbKst in different T1 tobacco lines than that of the vector transformed plants. Heterologous expression of BbKst under control of 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco showed high cellulose deposition in the xylem fibers. Number of xylary fibers was higher in transgenic T0 and T1 plants than that of empty-vector transformed tobacco plants offering enhanced mechanical strength to the transgenic plants, which was also substantiated by their strong upright phenotypes, significantly higher cellulose contents, flexibility coefficient, slenderness ratio, and lower Runkel ratio of the fibers.

CONCLUSIONS: This finding clearly demonstrated that BbKst gene (GenBank ID JQ432560) encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase. BbKst induced higher cellulose deposition/synthesis in transgenic tobacco plants, an important attribute of fiber quality bestowing additional strength to the plant.
24273431	Development and validation of a PCR-based functional marker system for the brown planthopper resistance gene Bph14 in rice.	2013	Breed Sci	Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most damaging rice pest globally. Resistant varieties are the most effective and environmental strategy for protecting the rice crop from BPH. Functional markers (FMs) designed from polymorphic sites within gene sequences affecting phenotypic variation are highly efficient when used for marker assisted selection (MAS). Bph14 is the first and only cloned insect resistance gene so far in rice. Compared to the sequences of its non-effective alleles there are a number SNP differences. In this study, the method of allele-specific amplification (ASA) was adopted to design a simple, co-dominant, functional marker Bph14P/N for Bph14. Bph14P/N was combined with two specific dominant markers: one, named Bph14P, targets the promoter region of Bph14 and amplifies 566 bp fragments; and the other, Bph14N, targets the LRR region of bph14 and amplifies 345 bp fragments. Specificity and applicability of the functional marker system were verified in two breeding populations and a Chinese mini core collection of Oryza sativa. We recommend the use of this simple, low-cost marker system in routine genotyping for Bph14 in breeding populations.
23995777	gltB/D mutants of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae are virulence deficient.	2014	Curr Microbiol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice. Upon clip inoculation of rice leaves, Xoo causes typical V-shaped lesions whose leading edge moves through the mid-veinal region. We have isolated a virulence deficient mutant of Xoo, referred to as BXO808 that causes limited lesions which primarily extend through the side-veinal regions of rice leaves. Functional complementation studies identified a clone, pSR19, from a cosmid genomic library that restored wild-type virulence and lesion phenotype to BXO808. Transposon mutagenesis of the pSR19 clone, marker exchange experiments, and targeted mutagenesis, revealed that the BXO808 phenotype is due to mutation in the gltB/D genes of Xoo, which encode glutamate synthase subunits α and β, respectively. The gltB/D mutants that were generated in this study also exhibited virulence deficiency, an altered lesion phenotype and growth deficiency on minimal medium with low levels of ammonium as a sole nitrogen source. This is the first report that mutations in the gltB/D genes of Xoo cause virulence deficiency.
24077726	Reverse-transcriptional gene expression of anammox and ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria in soybean and rice paddy soils of Northeast China.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	The relative gene expression of hydrazine oxidoreductase encoding gene (hzo) for anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (anammox) and ammonia monooxygenase encoding gene (amoA) for both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in Sanjiang Plain soybean and rice paddy soils of Northeast China was investigated by using real-time reverse-transcriptional quantitative PCR. Metabolically active populations of anammox, AOA, and AOB in rice paddy soils were evident by the presence and successful quantification of hzo mRNA and amoA mRNA genes. The expression ratio of amoA gene for both AOA and AOB varied between soybean soils and different rice paddy soils while the expression of hzo gene for anammox was detectable only in rice paddy soils by showing a diverse relative expression ratio in each soil sample. Gene expression of both archaeal and bacterial amoA genes in rice paddy soils differed among the three sampling depths, but that of hzo was not. Both archaeal and bacterial amoA genes showed an increase trend of expression level with continuation of rice paddy cultivation, but the low expression ratio of hzo gene indicated a relatively small contribution of anammox in overall removal of inorganic nitrogen through N2 even under anoxic and high nitrogen input in agriculture. Bacterial amoA gene from two soybean fields and three rice paddy fields were also analyzed for community composition by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprint. Community shift was observed between soybean and paddy fields and within each of them. The consistent occurrence of three bands 5, 6, and 7 in all samples showed their high adaptability for both arid cultivation and continuous rice paddy cultivation. Our data suggest that AOA and AOB are playing a more important role in nitrogen transformation in agricultural soils in oxic or anoxic environment and anammox bacteria may also contribute but in a less extent to N transformation in these agricultural soils under anoxic condition.
24128405	Utilization of rice husks modified by organomultiphosphonic acids as low-cost biosorbents for enhanced adsorption of heavy metal ions.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Novel biosorbent materials (RH-2 and RH-3) obtained from agricultural waste materials rice husks (RH-1) were successfully developed through fast and facile esterification reactions with hydroxylethylidenediphosphonic acid and nitrilotrimethylenetriphosphonic acid, respectively. The present paper reported the feasibility of using RH-1, RH-2 and RH-3 for removal of heavy metals from simulated wastewater, the results revealed that the adsorption property of functionalized rice husks with organotriphosphonic acid RH-3 for Au(III) was very excellent, especially for gold ions. The combined effect of initial solution pH, RH-3 dosage and initial Au(III) concentration was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM), the results showed that initial Au(III) concentration exerted stronger influence on Au(III) uptake than initial pH and biomass dosage. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the quadratic model demonstrated that the model was highly significant, and under the optimum process conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity could reach 3.25 ± 0.07 mmol/g that is higher than other reported adsorbents.
24028141	Genes for iron-sulphur cluster assembly are targets of abiotic stress in rice, Oryza sativa.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster assembly occurs in chloroplasts, mitochondria and cytosol, involving dozens of genes in higher plants. In this study, we have identified 41 putative Fe-S cluster assembly genes in rice (Oryza sativa) genome, and the expression of all genes was verified. To investigate the role of Fe-S cluster assembly as a metabolic pathway, we applied abiotic stresses to rice seedlings and analysed Fe-S cluster assembly gene expression by qRT-PCR. Our data showed that genes for Fe-S cluster assembly in chloroplasts of leaves are particularly sensitive to heavy metal treatments, and that Fe-S cluster assembly genes in roots were up-regulated in response to iron toxicity, oxidative stress and some heavy metal assault. The effect of each stress treatment on the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery demonstrated an unexpected tissue or organelle specificity, suggesting that the physiological relevance of the Fe-S cluster assembly is more complex than thought. Furthermore, our results may reveal potential candidate genes for molecular breeding of rice.
24102799	A novel membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase enhances the thermal resistance in plants.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	High temperature stress disturbs cellular homoeostasis and results in a severe retardation in crop growth and development. Thus, it is important to reveal the mechanism of plants coping with heat stress. In this study, a novel gene that we identified from Brassica napus, referred to as BnTR1, was found to play a key role in heat stress response in planta. BnTR1 is a membrane-bound RINGv (C₄HC₃) protein that displays E3 ligase activity in vitro. We demonstrated that modest expression of BnTR1 is sufficient to minimize adverse environmental influence and confers thermal resistance on development without any detrimental effects in B. napus and Oryza sativa. Our investigation into the action mechanism indicates that BnTR1 is likely to be involved in mediating Ca²⁺ dynamics by regulating the activity of calcium channels, which further alters the transcripts of heat shock factors and heat shock proteins contributing to plant thermotolerance. Hence, our study identified BnTR1 as a novel key factor underlying a conserved mechanism conferring thermal resistance in plants.
23996237	Nitrogen regulation involved in the accumulation of urea in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	2013	Yeast	Rice wine is a popular traditional alcoholic drink with a long history in China. However, the presence of the potential carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC) raises a series of food safety concerns. Although the metabolic pathway of urea (the major precusor of EC) has been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the regulation of urea accumulation remains unclear, making the efficient elimination of urea difficult. To demonstrate the regulatory mechanisms governing urea accumulation, three key nitrogen sources that can inhibit urea utilization for a commercial S. cerevisiae strain were identified. In addition, regulators of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways were identified as being involved in urea accumulation by real-time quantitative PCR. Based on these results, preferred nitrogen sources were found to repress urea utilization by converting them to glutamine or glutamate. Moreover, the results indicated that the manner of urea metabolism regulation was different for two positive regulators involved in NCR; Gln3p can be retained in the cytoplasm by glutamine, while Gat1p can be retained by glutamine and glutamate. Furthermore, this was confirmed by fluorescence location detection. These new findings provide new targets for eliminating EC and other harmful nitrogen-containing compounds in fermented foods.
24034357	A whole-genome SNP array (RICE6K) for genomic breeding in rice.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	The advances in genotyping technology provide an opportunity to use genomic tools in crop breeding. As compared to field selections performed in conventional breeding programmes, genomics-based genotype screen can potentially reduce number of breeding cycles and more precisely integrate target genes for particular traits into an ideal genetic background. We developed a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, RICE6K, based on Infinium technology, using representative SNPs selected from more than four million SNPs identified from resequencing data of more than 500 rice landraces. RICE6K contains 5102 SNP and insertion-deletion (InDel) markers, about 4500 of which were of high quality in the tested rice lines producing highly repeatable results. Forty-five functional markers that are located inside 28 characterized genes of important traits can be detected using RICE6K. The SNP markers are evenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes of rice with the average density of 12 SNPs per 1 Mb and can provide information for polymorphisms between indica and japonica subspecies as well as varieties within indica and japonica groups. Application tests of RICE6K showed that the array is suitable for rice germplasm fingerprinting, genotyping bulked segregating pools, seed authenticity check and genetic background selection. These results suggest that RICE6K provides an efficient and reliable genotyping tool for rice genomic breeding.
24042571	Fine mapping and chromosome walking towards the Ror1 locus in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).	2013	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: The Ror1 gene was fine-mapped to the pericentric region of barley chromosome 1HL. Recessively inherited loss-of-function alleles of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Mildew resistance locus o (Mlo) gene confer durable broad-spectrum disease resistance against the obligate biotrophic fungal powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei. Previous genetic analyses revealed two barley genes, Ror1 and Ror2, that are Required for mlo-specified resistance and basal defence. While Ror2 was cloned and shown to encode a t-SNARE protein (syntaxin), the molecular nature or Ror1 remained elusive. Ror1 was previously mapped to the centromeric region of the long arm of barley chromosome 1H. Here, we narrowed the barley Ror1 interval to 0.18 cM and initiated a chromosome walk using barley yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones, next-generation DNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two non-overlapping YAC contigs containing Ror1 flanking genes were identified. Despite a high degree of synteny observed between barley and the sequenced genomes of the grasses rice (Oryza sativa), Brachypodium distachyon and Sorghum bicolor across the wider chromosomal area, the genes in the YAC contigs showed extensive interspecific rearrangements in orientation and order. Consequently, the position of a Ror1 homolog in these species could not be precisely predicted, nor was a barley gene co-segregating with Ror1 identified. These factors have prevented the molecular identification of the Ror1 gene for the time being.
24018688	Effects of food lectins on the transport system of human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The effects of 16 lectins isolated from foodstuff on the transport system across human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers were investigated by using four fluorescent markers: lucifer yellow (LY) for the paracellular pathway, fluorescein (FL) for the monocarboxylic acid transporter-mediated pathway, rhodamine 123 for the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux pathway, and calcein for the multidrug resistance associated protein-related efflux pathway. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) values for the monolayers were also measured. WGA from wheat germ, ABA from white mushroom, AOL from Aspergillus oryzae, and CSL3 from chum salmon eggs (each at 100 µg/mL) decreased the TER value by 20-40% which resulted in increased LY transport. These lectins, as well as such other lectins as SBA from soybean, RBA from rice bran, and Con A from jack bean, affected other transport pathways too. These results indicate that the lectins modulated the transepithelial transport system in different ways, probably because of their specific binding characteristics toward Caco-2 cell monolayers.
24056072	Microarray detection and qPCR screening of potential biomarkers of Folsomia candida (Collembola: Isotomidae) exposed to Bt proteins (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac).	2014	Environ Pollut	The impact of Bt proteins on non-target arthropods is less understood than their effects on target organisms where the mechanism of toxic action is known. Here, we report the effects of two Bt proteins, Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, on gene expression in the non-target collembolan, Folsomia candida. A customized microarray was used to study gene expression in F. candida specimens that were exposed to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac. All selected transcripts were subsequently confirmed by qPCR. Eleven transcripts were finally verified, and three of them were annotated. The responses of all eleven transcripts were tested in specimens for both Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac at a series of concentrations. These transcripts were separated into two and three groups for Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, respectively, depend on their expression levels. However, those eleven transcripts did not respond to the Bt proteins in Bt-rice residues.
24012537	Sulfide oxidation, nitrate respiration, carbon acquisition, and electron transport pathways suggested by the draft genome of a single orange Guaymas Basin Beggiatoa (Cand. Maribeggiatoa) sp. filament.	2013	Mar Genomics	A near-complete draft genome has been obtained for a single vacuolated orange Beggiatoa (Cand. Maribeggiatoa) filament from a Guaymas Basin seafloor microbial mat, the third relatively complete sequence for the Beggiatoaceae. Possible pathways for sulfide oxidation; nitrate respiration; inorganic carbon fixation by both Type II RuBisCO and the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle; acetate and possibly formate uptake; and energy-generating electron transport via both oxidative phosphorylation and the Rnf complex are discussed here. A role in nitrite reduction is suggested for an abundant orange cytochrome produced by the Guaymas strain; this has a possible homolog in Beggiatoa (Cand. Isobeggiatoa) sp. PS, isolated from marine harbor sediment, but not Beggiatoa alba B18LD, isolated from a freshwater rice field ditch. Inferred phylogenies for the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the reductive (rTCA) and oxidative (TCA) tricarboxylic acid cycles suggest that genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase and enzymes for carboxylation and/or decarboxylation steps (including RuBisCO) may have been introduced to (or exported from) one or more of the three genomes by horizontal transfer, sometimes by different routes. Sequences from the two marine strains are generally more similar to each other than to sequences from the freshwater strain, except in the case of RuBisCO: only the Guaymas strain encodes a Type II enzyme, which (where studied) discriminates less against oxygen than do Type I RuBisCOs. Genes subject to horizontal transfer may represent key steps for adaptation to factors such as oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration, organic carbon availability, and environmental variability.
24009336	Functional analysis of Arabidopsis CYP714A1 and CYP714A2 reveals that they are distinct gibberellin modification enzymes.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Endogenous levels of bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are controlled by both biosynthetic and inactivation processes, and some cytochrome P450s are involved in this control mechanism. We have previously reported that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode the enzyme GA 13-oxidase, which is required for GA1 biosynthesis, and that CYP714D1 encodes GA 16α,17-epoxidase, which inactivates the non-13-hydroxy GAs in rice. Arabidopsis has two CYP714 members, CYP714A1 and CYP714A2. To clarify the possible role of these genes in GA metabolism, enzymatic activities of their recombinant proteins were analyzed using a yeast expression system. We found that the recombinant CYP714A1 protein catalyzes the conversion of GA12 to 16-carboxylated GA12 (16-carboxy-16β,17-dihydro GA12), a previously unidentified GA metabolite. Bioassays of this GA product showed that CYP714A1 is an inactivation enzyme in Arabidopsis. This was confirmed by the extreme GA-deficient dwarf phenotype shown by CYP714A1-overexpressing plants. Intriguingly, the recombinant CYP714A2 protein catalyzed the conversion of ent-kaurenoic acid into steviol (ent-13-hydroxy kaurenoic acid). When GA12 was used as a substrate for CYP714A2, 12α-hydroxy GA12 (GA111) was produced as a major product and 13-hydroxy GA12 (GA53) as a minor product. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the CYP714A2 gene showed semi-dwarfism. GA analysis showed that the levels of non-13-hydroxy GAs, including GA4, were decreased, whereas those of 13-hydroxy GAs, including GA1 (which is less active than GA4), were increased in the transgenic plants. Our results suggest that the CYP714 family proteins contribute to the production of diverse GA compounds through various oxidations of C and D rings in both monocots and eudicots.
24113511	Evaluation of Streptomyces strains isolated from herbal vermicompost for their plant growth-promotion traits in rice.	2014	Microbiol Res	Six actinomycetes, CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-93, CAI-140, CAI-155 and KAI-180, isolated from six different herbal vermi-composts were characterized for in vitro plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties and further evaluated in the field for PGP activity in rice. Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-93, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced siderophores; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced chitinase; CAI-13, CAI-140, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced lipase; CAI-13, CAI-93, CAI-155 and KAI-180 produced protease; and CAI-13, CAI-85, CAI-140 and CAI-155 produced ß-1-3-glucanase whereas all the six actinomycetes produced cellulase, hydrocyanic acid and indole acetic acid (IAA). The actinomycetes were able to grow in NaCl concentrations of up to 8%, at pH values between 7 and 11, temperatures between 20 and 40 °C and compatible with fungicide bavistin at field application levels. In the rice field, the actinomycetes significantly enhanced tiller numbers, panicle numbers, filled grain numbers and weight, stover yield, grain yield, total dry matter, root length, volume and dry weight over the un-inoculated control. In the rhizosphere, the actinomycetes also significantly enhanced total nitrogen, available phosphorous, % organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and dehydrogenase activity over the un-inoculated control. Sequences of 16S rDNA gene of the actinomycetes matched with different Streptomyces species in BLAST analysis. Of the six actinomycetes, CAI-85 and CAI-93 were found superior over other actinomycetes in terms of PGP properties, root development and crop productivity. qRT-PCR analysis on selected plant growth promoting genes of actinomycetes revealed the up-regulation of IAA genes only in CAI-85 and CAI-93.
24102738	Constitutive or seed-specific overexpression of Arabidopsis G-protein γ subunit 3 (AGG3) results in increased seed and oil production and improved stress tolerance in Camelina sativa.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Heterotrimeric G-proteins consisting of Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits play an integral role in mediating multiple signalling pathways in plants. A novel, recently identified plant-specific Gγ protein, AGG3, has been proposed to be an important regulator of organ size and mediator of stress responses in Arabidopsis, whereas its potential homologs in rice are major quantitative trait loci for seed size and panicle branching. To evaluate the role of AGG3 towards seed and oil yield improvement, the gene was overexpressed in Camelina sativa, an oilseed crop of the Brassicaceae family. Analysis of multiple homozygous T4 transgenic Camelina lines showed that constitutive overexpression of AGG3 resulted in faster vegetative as well as reproductive growth accompanied by an increase in photosynthetic efficiency. Moreover, when expressed constitutively or specifically in seed tissue, AGG3 was found to increase seed size, seed mass and seed number per plant by 15%-40%, effectively resulting in significantly higher oil yield per plant. AGG3 overexpressing Camelina plants also exhibited improved stress tolerance. These observations draw a strong link between the roles of AGG3 in regulating two critical yield parameters, seed traits and plant stress responses, and reveal an effective biotechnological tool to dramatically increase yield in agricultural crops.
24025514	Comparative analysis of seed transcriptomes of ambient ozone-fumigated 2 different rice cultivars.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	High ozone (O3) concentrations not only damage plant life but also cause considerable losses in plant productivity. To screen for molecular factors usable as potential biomarkers to identify for O3-sensitive and -tolerant lines and design O3 tolerant crops, our project examines the effects of O3 on rice, using high-throughput omics approaches. In this study, we examined growth and yield parameters of 4 rice cultivars fumigated for a life-time with ambient air (mean O3: 31.4-32.7 ppb) or filtered air (mean O3: 6.6-8.3 ppb) in small open-top chambers (sOTCs) to select O3-sensitive (indica cv Takanari) and O3-tolerant (japonica cv Koshihikari) cultivars for analysis of seed transcriptomes using Agilent 4 × 44K rice oligo DNA chip. Total RNA from dry mature dehusked seeds of Takanari and Koshihikari cultivars was extracted using a modified protocol based on cethyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction buffer and phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol treatment, followed by DNA microarray analysis using the established dye-swap method. Direct comparison of Koshihikari and Takanari O3 transcriptomes in seeds of rice plants fumigated with ambient O3 in sOTCs successfully showed that genes encoding proteins involved in jasmonic acid, GABA biosynthesis, cell wall and membrane modification, starch mobilization, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis are differently regulated in sensitive cv Takanari and tolerant cv Koshihikari. MapMan analysis further mapped the molecular factors activated by O3, confirming Takanari is rightly classified as an O3 sensitive genotype.
24074460	Calmodulin-dependent and calmodulin-independent glutamate decarboxylases in apple fruit.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The ubiquitous, non-proteinaceous amino acid GABA (γ-aminobutyrate) accumulates in plants subjected to abiotic stresses such as chilling, O2 deficiency and elevated CO2. Recent evidence indicates that controlled atmosphere storage causes the accumulation of GABA in apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) fruit, and now there is increasing interest in the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Here, we investigated whether this phenomenon could be mediated via Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) activation of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity.

RESULTS: GAD activity in cell-free extracts of apple fruit was stimulated by Ca(2+)/CaM at physiological pH, but not at the acidic pH optimum. Based on bioinformatics analysis of the apple genome, three apple GAD genes were identified and their expression determined in various apple organs, including fruit. Like recombinant Arabidopsis GAD1, the activity and spectral properties of recombinant MdGAD1 and MdGAD2 were regulated by Ca(2+)/CaM at physiological pH and both enzymes possessed a highly conserved CaM-binding domain that was autoinhibitory. In contrast, the activity and spectral properties of recombinant MdGAD3 were not affected by Ca(2+)/CaM and they were much less sensitive to pH than MdGAD1, MdGAD2 and Arabidopsis GAD1; furthermore, the C-terminal region neither bound CaM nor functioned as an autoinhibitory domain.

CONCLUSIONS: Plant GADs typically differ from microbial and animal GAD enzymes in possessing a C-terminal 30-50 amino acid residue CaM-binding domain. To date, rice GAD2 is the only exception to this generalization; notably, the C-terminal region of this enzyme still functions as an autoinhibitory domain. In the present study, apple fruit were found to contain two CaM-dependent GADs, as well as a novel CaM-independent GAD that does not possess a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain.
24058671	Mutation of the light-induced yellow leaf 1 gene, which encodes a geranylgeranyl reductase, affects chlorophyll biosynthesis and light sensitivity in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Chlorophylls (Chls) are crucial for capturing light energy for photosynthesis. Although several genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis were characterized in rice (Oryza sativa), the genetic properties of the hydrogenating enzyme involved in the final step of Chl synthesis remain unknown. In this study, we characterized a rice light-induced yellow leaf 1-1 (lyl1-1) mutant that is hypersensitive to high-light and defective in the Chl synthesis. Light-shading experiment suggested that the yellowing of lyl1-1 is light-induced. Map-based cloning of LYL1 revealed that it encodes a geranylgeranyl reductase. The mutation of LYL1 led to the majority of Chl molecules are conjugated with an unsaturated geranylgeraniol side chain. LYL1 is the firstly defined gene involved in the reduction step from Chl-geranylgeranylated (Chl(GG)) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to Chl-phytol (Chl(Phy)) and phytyl pyrophosphate (PPP) in rice. LYL1 can be induced by light and suppressed by darkness which is consistent with its potential biological functions. Additionally, the lyl1-1 mutant suffered from severe photooxidative damage and displayed a drastic reduction in the levels of α-tocopherol and photosynthetic proteins. We concluded that LYL1 also plays an important role in response to high-light in rice.
24043333	A knockdown mutation of YELLOW-GREEN LEAF2 blocks chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: An insert mutation of YELLOW-GREEN LEAF2 , encoding Heme Oxygenase 1 , results in significant reduction of its transcript levels, and therefore impairs chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice. Heme oxygenase (HO) in higher plants catalyzes the degradation of heme to synthesize phytochrome precursor and its roles conferring the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice have been revealed. However, its involvement in regulating rice chlorophyll (Chl) synthesis is not fully explored. In this study, we isolated a rice mutant named yellow-green leaf 2 (ygl2) from a (60)Co-irradiated population. Normal grown ygl2 seedlings showed yellow-green leaves with reduced contents of Chl and tetrapyrrole intermediates whereas an increase of Chl a/b ratio. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated grana were poorly stacked in ygl2 mutant, resulting in underdevelopment of chloroplasts. The ygl2 locus was mapped to chromosome 6 and isolated via map-based cloning. Sequence analysis indicated that it encodes the rice HO1 and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation test and RNA interference. A 7-Kb insertion was found in the first exon of YGL2/HO1, resulting in significant reduction of YGL2 expressions in the ygl2 mutant. YGL2 was constitutively expressed in a variety of rice tissues with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by temperature. In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were concurrently altered in ygl2 mutant. These results provide direct evidence that YGL2 has a vital function in rice Chl biosynthesis.
24273430	Detection and verification of QTLs associated with heat-induced quality decline of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using recombinant inbred lines and near-isogenic lines.	2013	Breed Sci	Decline in the apparent quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain due to high temperatures during ripening recently became a major concern in many areas in Japan. The occurrence of white-back kernels (WBK) is one of the main problems of heat-induced quality decline. We identified QTLs associated with the occurrence of WBK using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and verified their effects using near-isogenic lines (NILs). The QTL analysis used F7 and F8 RILs derived from 'Hana-echizen' (HE), which is tolerant to high temperature, × 'Niigata-wase' (NW), which is sensitive to high temperature. Four QTLs were identified on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, and 9 (qWB3, qWB4, qWB6 and qWB9). To verify the effects of qWB6 and qWB9, we developed two NILs in which qWB6 or both were introduced from HE into the NW background. The HE allele at qWB6 significantly decreased WBK under multiple environments. The combination of qWB6 and qWB9 in an F2 population derived from a cross between a NIL and NW showed that the NW allele at qWB9 significantly decreased WBK if the qWB6 allele was HE. These results will be of value in marker-assisted selection for the breeding of rice with tolerance to heat-induced quality decline.
24033370	Functional analyses of three ASMT gene family members in rice plants.	2013	J Pineal Res	N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) is the final enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway that produces melatonin. ASMT may play a rate-limiting role in the production of this bioactive molecule in plants. There are three ASMT genes (ASMT1-ASMT3) in the rice genome, but only ASMT1 has been functionally characterized. A major barrier to further progress in characterizing these genes has been a failure of functional expression within the Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant ASMT2 and ASMT3 are inactive in ASMT enzyme catalysis. To determine the biological functions of ASMT2 and ASMT3, we first overexpressed them in rice calli, which resulted in enhanced production of melatonin in the respective transgenic calli. To further corroborate the functions of ASMT2 and ASMT3 as ASMT genes, we generated stable transgenic rice plants. ASMT enzyme activity was increased in comparison with the wild type in T2 homozygous transgenic rice plants expressing three ASMT genes independently. When seedlings were treated with 1 mm N-acetylserotonin (NAS), leaf melatonin contents were higher in the three transgenic lines than in the wild type. There were no significant differences between the transgenic lines and the wild type without this treatment. ASMT1 and ASMT2 transcripts were highly expressed in stems and flowers, but ASMT3 was barely detectable in any of the plant organs. All three ASMT mRNAs were simultaneously induced in treatments with abscisic and methyl jasmonic acids.
24021715	Proteolytic processing of Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Cry1Ab in rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).	2013	J Invertebr Pathol	To understand the low toxicity of Cry toxins in planthoppers, proteolytic activation of Cry1Ab in Nilaparvata lugens was studied. The proteolytic processing of Cry1Ab protoxin by N. lugens midgut proteases was similar to that by trypsin activated Cry1Ab. The Cry1Ab processed with N. lugens midgut proteases was highly insecticidal against Plutella xylostella. However, Cry1Ab activated either by trypsin or the gut proteases of the brown planthopper showed low toxicity in N. lugens. Binding analysis showed that activated Cry1Ab bound to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from N. lugens at a significantly lower level than to BBMV from P. xylostella.
24079304	Identification and fine-mapping of a QTL, qMrdd1, that confers recessive resistance to maize rough dwarf disease.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a devastating viral disease that results in considerable yield losses worldwide. Three major strains of virus cause MRDD, including maize rough dwarf virus in Europe, Mal de Río Cuarto virus in South America, and rice black-streaked dwarf virus in East Asia. These viral pathogens belong to the genus fijivirus in the family Reoviridae. Resistance against MRDD is a complex trait that involves a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The primary approach used to minimize yield losses from these viruses is to breed and deploy resistant maize hybrids.

RESULTS: Of the 50 heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs), 24 showed consistent responses to MRDD across different years and locations, in which 9 were resistant and 15 were susceptible. We performed trait-marker association analysis on the 24 HIFs and found six chromosomal regions which were putatively associated with MRDD resistance. We then conducted QTL analysis and detected a major resistance QTL, qMrdd1, on chromosome 8. By applying recombinant-derived progeny testing to self-pollinated backcrossed families, we fine-mapped the qMrdd1 locus into a 1.2-Mb region flanked by markers M103-4 and M105-3. The qMrdd1 locus acted in a recessive manner to reduce the disease-severity index (DSI) by 24.2-39.3%. The genetic effect of qMrdd1 was validated using another F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population in which MRDD resistance was segregating and two genotypes at the qMrdd1 locus differed significantly in DSI values.

CONCLUSIONS: The qMrdd1 locus is a major resistance QTL, acting in a recessive manner to increase maize resistance to MRDD. We mapped qMrdd1 to a 1.2-Mb region, which will enable the introgression of qMrdd1-based resistance into elite maize hybrids and reduce MRDD-related crop losses.
24077888	Identification and diversity of functional centromere satellites in the wild rice species Oryza brachyantha.	2013	Chromosome Res	The centromere is a key chromosomal component for sister chromatid cohesion and is the site for kinetochore assembly and spindle fiber attachment, allowing each sister chromatid to faithfully segregate to each daughter cell during cell division. It is not clear what types of sequences act as functional centromeres and how centromere sequences are organized in Oryza brachyantha, an FF genome species. In this study, we found that the three classes of centromere-specific CentO-F satellites (CentO-F1, CentO-F2, and CentOF3) in O. brachyantha share no homology with the CentO satellites in Oryza sativa. The three classes of CentO-F satellites are all located within the chromosomal regions to which the spindle fibers attach and are characterized by megabase tandem arrays that are flanked by centromere-specific retrotransposons, CRR-F, in the O. brachyantha centromeres. Although these CentO-F satellites are quantitatively variable among 12 O. brachyantha centromeres, immunostaining with an antibody specific to CENH3 indicates that they are colocated with CENH3 in functional centromere regions. Our results demonstrate that the three classes of CentO-F satellites may be the major components of functional centromeres in O. brachyantha.
24012281	Serum adiponectin concentration in relation to macronutrient and food intake in young Japanese women.	None	Nutrition	OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the relation of modifiable dietary factors to circulating adiponectin concentrations, particularly in young adults and non-Western populations. The aim of this study was to determine the association between macronutrient and food intake and serum adiponectin concentration in a group of young Japanese women.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1047 female Japanese dietetic students aged 18 to 22 y. Using a validated, self-administered, comprehensive diet history questionnaire, we assessed intake of nutrients (protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber) and foods (rice, bread, noodles, potatoes, confectioneries, fats and oils, pulses, fish and shellfish, meats, eggs, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, coffee, green and oolong tea, black tea, and soft drinks) and glycemic index and load. Fasting blood samples were collected and serum adiponectin concentrations were measured. Adjustment was made for survey year, region, municipality level, current smoking, current alcohol drinking, physical activity, body mass index, energy intake, and intakes of other nutrients or foods.

RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounding factors, none of the nutrients examined was a significant determinant of serum adiponectin concentration. There was no association for glycemic index or load. Coffee was the only food significantly and independently associated with serum adiponectin concentration. Mean (SE) values of serum adiponectin concentration for each quartile of coffee intake were 12.4 (0.2), 12.4 (0.5), 12.5 (0.3), and 13.2 (0.3) μg/mL, respectively (P for trend = 0.04).

CONCLUSION: In a group of young Japanese women, higher coffee intake was independently associated with higher serum adiponectin concentration.
24090832	Sonochemical synthesis, structural, magnetic and grain size dependent electrical properties of NdVO4 nanoparticles.	2014	Ultrason Sonochem	NdVO4 nanoparticles are successfully synthesized by efficient sonochemical method using two different structural directing agents like CTAB and P123. The phase formation and functional group analysis are carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fourier transform infra red (FT-IR) spectra, respectively. Using Scherrer equation the calculated grain sizes are 27 nm, 24 nm and 20 nm corresponding to NdVO4 synthesized by without surfactant, with CTAB and P123, respectively. The TEM images revealed that the shape of NdVO4 particles is rice-like and rod shaped particles while using CTAB and P123 as surfactants. The growth mechanism of NdVO4 nanoparticles is elucidated with the aid of TEM analysis. From electrical analysis, the conductivity of NdVO4 nanoparticles synthesized without surfactant showed a higher conductivity of 5.5703 × 10(-6) S cm(-1). The conductivity of the material depends on grain size and increased with increase in grain size due to the grain size effect. The magnetic measurements indicated the paramagnetic behavior of NdVO4 nanoparticles.
24102775	The production of recombinant cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides in plant cells induces the formation of protein bodies derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Synthetic linear antimicrobial peptides with cationic α-helical structures, such as BP100, are valuable as novel therapeutics and preservatives. However, they tend to be toxic when expressed at high levels as recombinant peptides in plants, and they can be difficult to detect and isolate from complex plant tissues because they are strongly cationic and display low extinction coefficient and extremely limited immunogenicity. We therefore expressed BP100 with a C-terminal tag which preserved its antimicrobial activity and demonstrated significant accumulation in plant cells. We used a fluorescent tag to trace BP100 following transiently expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and showed that it accumulated in large vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) along with typical ER luminal proteins. Interestingly, the formation of these vesicles was induced by BP100. Similar vesicles formed in stably transformed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, but the recombinant peptide was toxic to the host during latter developmental stages. This was avoided by selecting active BP100 derivatives based on their low haemolytic activity even though the selected peptides remained toxic to plant cells when applied exogenously at high doses. Using this strategy, we generated transgenic rice lines producing active BP100 derivatives with a yield of up to 0.5% total soluble protein.
24086432	Aphanomyces euteiches cell wall fractions containing novel glucan-chitosaccharides induce defense genes and nuclear calcium oscillations in the plant host Medicago truncatula.	2013	PLoS One	N-acetylglucosamine-based saccharides (chitosaccharides) are components of microbial cell walls and act as molecular signals during host-microbe interactions. In the legume plant Medicago truncatula, the perception of lipochitooligosaccharide signals produced by symbiotic rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi involves the Nod Factor Perception (NFP) lysin motif receptor-like protein and leads to the activation of the so-called common symbiotic pathway. In rice and Arabidopsis, lysin motif receptors are involved in the perception of chitooligosaccharides released by pathogenic fungi, resulting in the activation of plant immunity. Here we report the structural characterization of atypical chitosaccharides from the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches, and their biological activity on the host Medicago truncatula. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that these chitosaccharides are linked to β-1,6-glucans, and contain a β-(1,3;1,4)-glucan backbone whose β-1,3-linked glucose units are substituted on their C-6 carbon by either glucose or N-acetylglucosamine residues. This is the first description of this type of structural motif in eukaryotic cell walls. Glucan-chitosaccharide fractions of A. euteiches induced the expression of defense marker genes in Medicago truncatula seedlings independently from the presence of a functional Nod Factor Perception protein. Furthermore, one of the glucan-chitosaccharide fractions elicited calcium oscillations in the nucleus of root cells. In contrast to the asymmetric oscillatory calcium spiking induced by symbiotic lipochitooligosaccharides, this response depends neither on the Nod Factor Perception protein nor on the common symbiotic pathway. These findings open new perspectives in oomycete cell wall biology and elicitor recognition and signaling in legumes.
24273421	Identification of qRL7, a major quantitative trait locus associated with rice root length in hydroponic conditions.	2013	Breed Sci	Root system development is an important target for improving yield in rice. Active roots that can take up nutrients more efficiently are essential for improving grain yield. In this study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Xieqingzao B (XB), a maintainer line with short roots and R9308, a restorer line with long roots. Only a QTLs associated with root length were mapped on chromosomes 7. The QTL, named qRL7, was located between markers RM3859 and RM214 on chromosome 7 and explained 18.14-18.36% of the total phenotypic variance evaluated across two years. Fine mapping of qRL7 using eight BC3F3 recombinant lines mapped the QTL to between markers InDel11 and InDel17, which delimit a 657.35 kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. To determine the genotype classes for the target QTL in these BC3F3 recombinants, the root lengths of their BC3F4 progeny were investigated, and the result showed that qRL7 plays a crucial role in root length. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the genetic factors controlling root architecture, which will help rice breeders to breed varieties with deep, strong and vigorous root systems.
24013236	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus genome segment S5 is a bicistronic mRNA in infected plants.	2014	Arch Virol	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is a recognized member of the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae. Genome segment S5 has a putative second ORF partially overlapping the major ORF but in a different reading frame. This putative ORF is present in a published sequence and in two Chinese isolates now sequenced. Antibodies were raised against purified P5-1 and P5-2 fusion proteins expressed in a prokaryotic system. In western blots, these antibodies reacted with proteins of about 106 and 27 kDa, respectively, as predicted by sequence analysis. In immunoelectron microscopy, antibodies to P5-1 reacted with viroplasms, indicating that P5-1 is a component of viroplasms, but no labeling was observed with P5-2 antisera. Northern blot assays showed that the genome segment S5 was transcribed as a single mRNA with no subgenomic RNA. These results show that S5 is functionally bicistronic in infected plants. Possible translational mechanisms for P5-2 are discussed.
23938389	Production of marker-free and RSV-resistant transgenic rice using a twin T-DNA system and RNAi.	2013	J Biosci	A twin T-DNA system is a convenient strategy for creating selectable marker-free transgenic plants. The standard transformation plasmid, pCAMBIA 1300, was modified into a binary vector consisting of two separate T-DNAs, one of which contained the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) marker gene. Using this binary vector, we constructed two vectors that expressed inverted-repeat (IR) structures targeting the rice stripe virus (RSV) coat protein (CP) gene and the special-disease protein (SP) gene. Transgenic rice lines were obtained via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Seven independent clones harbouring both the hpt marker gene and the target genes (RSV CP or SP) were obtained in the primary transformants of pDTRSVCP and pDTRSVSP, respectively. The segregation frequencies of the target gene and the marker gene in the T1 plants were 8.72 percent for pDTRSVCP and 12.33 percent for pDTRSVSP. Two of the pDTRSVCP lines and three pDTRSVSP lines harbouring the homozygous target gene, but not the hpt gene, were strongly resistant to RSV. A molecular analysis of the resistant transgenic plants confirmed the stable integration and expression of the target genes. The resistant transgenic plants displayed lower levels of the transgene transcripts and specific small interfering RNAs, suggesting that RNAi induced the viral resistance.
24118770	Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice.	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	Sugar metabolism and sugar signalling are not only critical for plant growth and development, but are also important for stress responses. However, how sugar homeostasis is involved in plant defence against pathogen attack in the model crop rice remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that the grains of gif1, a loss-of-function mutant of the cell wall invertase gene GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1), were hypersusceptible to postharvest fungal pathogens, with decreased levels of sugars and a thinner glume cell wall in comparison with the wild-type. Interestingly, constitutive expression of GIF1 enhanced resistance to both the rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. The GIF1-overexpressing (GIF1-OE) plants accumulated higher levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose compared with the wild-type plants. More importantly, higher levels of callose were deposited in GIF1-OE plants during pathogen infection. Moreover, the cell wall was much thicker in the infection sites of the GIF1-OE plants when compared with the wild-type plants. We also found that defence-related genes were constitutively activated in the GIF1-OE plants. Taken together, our study reveals that sugar homeostasis mediated by GIF1 plays an important role in constitutive and induced physical and chemical defence.
24030721	The MAPKKK gene family in Gossypium raimondii: genome-wide identification, classification and expression analysis.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are conserved signal transduction pathways in all eukaryotic organisms. MAPKKKs (MAPK kinase kinases) operate at the top levels of these cascades. Recently, this family of genes has been systematically investigated in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, but has not yet been characterized in cotton. In this study, we identified 78 putative MAPKKK genes in the genome of the diploid cotton, Gossypium raimondii. They were classified into three subfamilies, of which 12 were ZIK, 22 were MEKK and 44 were Raf. The ZIK and MEKK genes displayed a scattered genomic distribution across 11 of the 13 chromosomes, whereas Raf genes were distributed across the entire genome. Their conserved patterns observed for introns and additional domains were consistent with the evolutionary relationships inferred from the phylogenetic analysis within subfamily. Transcriptome sequencing data were used to investigate their transcript profiles in mature leaves, 0 day and 3 days post-anthesis (DPA) ovules. Sixty MAPKKK genes were expressed, of which 41 were strongly expressed in mature leaves. Twelve MAPKKK genes were more highly expressed in 3-DPA ovules than in 0-DPA ovules. Our results provide a foundation for future evolutionary and functional characterizations of MAPKKK genes in cotton and probably other Gossypium plants.
24056455	An efficient method using Gluconacetobacter europaeus to reduce an unfavorable flavor compound, acetoin, in rice vinegar production.	2013	Appl Environ Microbiol	Gluconacetobacter europaeus, one of the microorganisms most commonly used for vinegar production, produces the unfavorable flavor compound acetoin. Since acetoin reduction is important for rice vinegar production, a genetic approach was attempted to reduce acetoin produced by G. europaeus KGMA0119 using specific gene knockout without introducing exogenous antibiotic resistance genes. A uracil-auxotrophic mutant with deletion of the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase gene (pyrE) was first isolated by positive selection using 5-fluoroorotic acid. The pyrE disruptant designated KGMA0704 (ΔpyrE) showed 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance. KGMA0704 and the pyrE gene were used for further gene disruption experiments as a host cell and a selectable marker, respectively. Targeted disruption of aldC or als, which encodes α-acetolactate decarboxylase or α-acetolactate synthase, was attempted in KGMA0704. The disruption of these genes was expected to result in a decrease in acetoin levels. A disruption vector harboring the pyrE marker within the targeted gene was constructed for double-crossover recombination. The cells of KGMA0704 were transformed with the exogenous DNA using electroporation, and genotypic analyses of the transformants revealed the unique occurrence of targeted aldC or als gene disruption. The aldC disruptant KGMA4004 and the als disruptant KGMA5315 were cultivated, and the amount of acetoin was monitored. The acetoin level in KGMA4004 culture was significantly reduced to 0.009% (wt/vol) compared with KGMA0119 (0.042% [wt/vol]), whereas that of KGMA5315 was not affected (0.037% [wt/vol]). This indicates that aldC disruption is critical for acetoin reduction. G. europaeus KGMA4004 has clear application potential in the production of rice vinegar with less unfavorable flavor.
24273423	Detection of QTLs to reduce cadmium content in rice grains using LAC23/Koshihikari chromosome segment substitution lines.	2013	Breed Sci	To advance the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to reduce Cd content in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains and breed low-Cd cultivars, we developed a novel population consisting of 46 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) in which donor segments of LAC23, a cultivar reported to have a low grain Cd content, were substituted into the Koshihikari genetic background. The parental cultivars and 32 CSSLs (the minimum set required for whole-genome coverage) were grown in two fields with different natural levels of soil Cd. QTL mapping by single-marker analysis using ANOVA indicated that eight chromosomal regions were associated with grain Cd content and detected a major QTL (qlGCd3) with a high F-test value in both fields (F = 9.19 and 5.60) on the long arm of chromosome 3. The LAC23 allele at qlGCd3 was associated with reduced grain Cd levels and appeared to reduce Cd transport from the shoots to the grains. Fine substitution mapping delimited qlGCd3 to a 3.5-Mbp region. Our results suggest that the low-Cd trait of LAC23 is controlled by multiple QTLs, and qlGCd3 is a promising candidate QTL to reduce the Cd level of rice grain.
24098073	Upregulation of genes related to bone formation by γ-amino butyric acid and γ-oryzanol in germinated brown rice is via the activation of GABAB-receptors and reduction of serum IL-6 in rats.	2013	Clin Interv Aging	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis and other bone degenerative diseases are among the most challenging non-communicable diseases to treat. Previous works relate bone loss due to osteoporosis with oxidative stress generated by free radicals and inflammatory cytokines. Alternative therapy to hormone replacement has been an area of interest to researchers for almost three decades due to hormone therapy-associated side effects.

METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), gamma-oryzanol (ORZ), acylated steryl glucosides (ASG), and phenolic extracts from germinated brown rice (GBR) on the expression of genes related to bone metabolism, such as bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2), osteoblast-specific transcription factor osterix (Osx), periostin, osteoblast specific factor (Postn), collagen 1&2 (Col1&2), calcitonin receptor gene (CGRP); body weight measurement and also serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and osteocalcin, in serum and bone. Rats were treated with GBR, ORZ, GABA, and ASG at (100 and 200 mg/kg); estrogen (0.2 mg/kg), or remifemin (10 and 20 mg/kg), compared to ovariectomized non-treated group as well as non-ovariectomized non-treated (sham) group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the IL-6 and osteocalcin levels at week 2, 4, and 8, while the gene expression in the bone tissue was determined using the Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA).

RESULTS: The results indicate that groups treated with GABA (100 and 200 mg/kg) showed significant upregulation of SPARC, calcitonin receptor, and BMP-2 genes (P < 0.05), while the ORZ-treated group (100 and 200 mg/kg) revealed significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of Osx, Postn, RUNX-2, and Col1&2. Similarly, IL-6 concentration decreased, while osteocalcin levels increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the treated groups as compared to ovariectomized non-treated groups.

CONCLUSION: GABA and ORZ from GBR stimulates osteoblastogenesis by upregulation of bone formation genes, possibly via the activation of GABAB receptors and by inhibiting the activity of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it could be used effectively in the management of osteoporosis.
24273425	Mapping and validation of QTLs for rice sheath blight resistance.	2013	Breed Sci	Sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most serious diseases of rice. Among 33 rice accessions, mainly from National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) Core Collection, we found three landraces from the Himalayas-Jarjan, Nepal 555 and Nepal 8-with resistance to sheath blight in 3 years' field testing. Backcrossed inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between Jarjan and the leading Japanese cultivar Koshihikari were used in QTL analyses. Since later-heading lines show fewer lesions, we used only earlier-heading BILs to avoid association with heading date. We detected eight QTLs; the Jarjan allele of three of these increased resistance. Only one QTL, on chromosome 9 (between markers Nag08KK18184 and Nag08KK18871), was detected in all 3 years. Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) carrying it showed resistance in field tests. Thirty F2 lines derived from a cross between Koshihikari and one CSSL supported the QTL.
24077074	Root transcript profiling of two Rorippa species reveals gene clusters associated with extreme submergence tolerance.	2013	Plant Physiol	Complete submergence represses photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, causing rapid mortality in most terrestrial plants. However, some plants have evolved traits allowing them to survive prolonged flooding, such as species of the genus Rorippa, close relatives of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We studied plant survival, changes in carbohydrate and metabolite concentrations, and transcriptome responses to submergence of two species, Rorippa sylvestris and Rorippa amphibia. We exploited the close relationship between Rorippa species and the model species Arabidopsis by using Arabidopsis GeneChip microarrays for whole-genome transcript profiling of roots of young plants exposed to a 24-h submergence treatment or air. A probe mask was used based on hybridization of genomic DNA of both species to the arrays, so that weak probe signals due to Rorippa species/Arabidopsis mismatches were removed. Furthermore, we compared Rorippa species microarray results with those obtained for roots of submerged Arabidopsis plants. Both Rorippa species could tolerate deep submergence, with R. sylvestris surviving much longer than R. amphibia. Submergence resulted in the induction of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation and the repression of many energy-consuming pathways, similar to the low-oxygen and submergence response of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). The qualitative responses of both Rorippa species to submergence appeared roughly similar but differed quantitatively. Notably, glycolysis and fermentation genes and a gene encoding sucrose synthase were more strongly induced in the less tolerant R. amphibia than in R. sylvestris. A comparison with Arabidopsis microarray studies on submerged roots revealed some interesting differences and potential tolerance-related genes in Rorippa species.
24089866	A hyperspectral imaging system for an accurate prediction of the above-ground biomass of individual rice plants.	2013	Rev Sci Instrum	Biomass is an important component of the plant phenomics, and the existing methods for biomass estimation for individual plants are either destructive or lack accuracy. In this study, a hyperspectral imaging system was developed for the accurate prediction of the above-ground biomass of individual rice plants in the visible and near-infrared spectral region. First, the structure of the system and the influence of various parameters on the camera acquisition speed were established. Then the system was used to image 152 rice plants, which selected from the rice mini-core collection, in two stages, the tillering to elongation (T-E) stage and the booting to heading (B-H) stage. Several variables were extracted from the images. Following, linear stepwise regression analysis and 5-fold cross-validation were used to select effective variables for model construction and test the stability of the model, respectively. For the T-E stage, the R(2) value was 0.940 for the fresh weight (FW) and 0.935 for the dry weight (DW). For the B-H stage, the R(2) value was 0.891 for the FW and 0.783 for the DW. Moreover, estimations of the biomass using visible light images were also calculated. These comparisons showed that hyperspectral imaging performed better than the visible light imaging. Therefore, this study provides not only a stable hyperspectral imaging platform but also an accurate and nondestructive method for the prediction of biomass for individual rice plants.
24061417	Two new β-glucosidases from ethanol-fermenting fungus Mucor circinelloides NBRC 4572: enzyme purification, functional characterization, and molecular cloning of the gene.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Two β-glucosidases (BGLs 1 and 2) were purified to homogeneity from the extracellular enzyme preparations of the ethanol-fermenting Mucor circinelloides NBRC 4572 statically grown on rice straw. BGLs 1 and 2 are monomeric glycoproteins whose apparent molecular masses (Ms) are around 78 kDa, which decreased by approximately 10 kDa upon enzymatic deglycosylation. Both BGLs showed similar enzyme characteristics in optimal temperature and pH, stability, and inhibitors. They were active against a wide range of aryl-β-glucosides and β-linked glucose oligosaccharides. Their amino acid sequences shared 81% identity and exhibited less than 60% identity with the known family-3 BGLs. Considering properties such as reduced inhibition by ethanol, glucose, and cellobiose, low transglucosylation activity, wider substrate range, less binding affinity to lignocellulosic materials, and abundant expression, BGL1 is likely to be more suitable for bioethanol production than BGL2 via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of rice straw with M. circinelloides.
24043853	WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance.	2013	J Exp Bot	OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice. The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.
24043854	A CLE-WOX signalling module regulates root meristem maintenance and vascular tissue development in rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-related (CLE) proteins belong to a small peptide family conserved in plants. Recent studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revealed a key role for CLEs in mediating cell-cell communication and stem cell maintenance during plant development, but how CLE signalling controls root development in the rice remains largely unknown. Here it is shown that exogenous application of a synthetic dodeca-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of the rice FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN2 (FCP2p) protein or overexpression of FCP2 terminates root apical meristem (RAM) activity and impairs late metaxylem formation. FCP2p treatment suppresses the expression of the rice QUIESCENT-CENTER-SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX (QHB) gene, a putative orthologue of Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS)-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) gene, in both quiescent centre and late metaxylem cells; whereas inducible overexpression of QHB reduces the sensitivity of rice to FCP2p treatment. These results together suggest that in rice RAM maintenance and late metaxylem development are probably controlled by the mutual regulation between FCP2 and QHB. Moreover, a cross-species peptide treatment experiment in Arabidopsis implies that FCP2 has both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific roles in root development.
24005473	Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of efficient nitrogen-fixing Azotobacter strains from rice fields for crop improvement.	2014	Protoplasma	Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is highly effective in the field and potentially useful to reduce adverse effects chemical fertilisers. Here, Azotobacter species were selected via phenotypic, biochemical and molecular characterisations from different rice fields. Acetylene reduction assay of Azotobacter spp. showed that Azotobacter vinelandii (Az3) fixed higher amount of nitrogen (121.09 nmol C2H4 mg(-1) bacteria h(-1)). Likewise, its plant growth functions, viz. siderophore, hydrogen cyanide, salicylic acid, IAA, GA3, zeatin, NH3, phosphorus solubilisation, ACC deaminase and iron tolerance, were also higher. The profile of gDNA, plasmid DNA and cellular protein profile depicted inter-generic and inter-specific diversity among the isolates of A. vinelandii. The PCR-amplified genes nifH, nifD and nifK of 0.87, 1.4 and 1.5 kb , respectively, were ascertained by Southern blot hybridisation in isolates of A. vinelandii. The 16S rRNA sequence from A. vinelandii (Az3) was novel, and its accession number (JQ796077) was received from NCBI data base. Biofertiliser formulation of novel A. vinelandii isolates along with commercial one was evaluated in rice (Oriza sativa L. var. Khandagiri) fields. The present finding revealed that treatment T4 (Az3) (A. vinelandii) are highly efficient to improved growth and yield of rice crop.
24061553	Rice bran extract affects differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells potency into osteogenic cells.	2013	Cytotechnology	As rice bran contains various nutrients and other proteins of which a part has biological effects on animal cells, we tested the effect of rice bran extract on rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) obtained from bone marrow. These rMSCs are pluripotent and can be readily induced to differentiate into a number of cell types, including bone and cartilage. rMSC was aggregated by culturing in serum-free condition with rice bran extract, but was not aggregated by culturing in serum-free condition or in serum-containing medium. Moreover, the longer aggregates of rMSCs were cultured in serum-free condition with rice bran extract, the more the aggregates grew. After two passages in serum-free conditions, rMSCs lost their potency for differentiation into osteogenic cells; however, the addition of rice bran extract to serum-free medium successfully prevented the loss of this ability for differentiation. In addition, MSC makers CD105 and CD166 gene expression in serum-free condition with rice barn extract corresponded to these expressions in serum-containing medium. This result suggests that certain factors in rice bran could be bioactive and contribute toward retaining the ability of MSCs to differentiate into osteogenic cells after passaging.
24078111	Method for RNA extraction and cDNA library construction from microbes in crop rhizosphere soil.	2014	World J Microbiol Biotechnol	Techniques to analyze the transcriptome of the soil rhizosphere are essential to reveal the interactions and communications between plants and microorganisms in the soil ecosystem. In this study, different volumes of Al₂(SO₄)₃ were added to rhizosphere soil samples to precipitate humic substances, which interfere with most procedures of RNA and DNA analyses. After humic substances were precipitated, cells of soil microorganisms were broken by vortexing with glass beads, and then DNA and RNA were recovered using Tris-HCl buffer with LiCl, SDS, and EDTA. The crude extract was precipitated and dissolved in RNAse-free water, and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. We determined the optimum volume of Al₂(SO₄)₃ for treating rhizosphere soil of rice, tobacco, sugarcane, Rehmannia glutinosa, and Pseudostellaria heterophylla. The crude nucleic acids extract from rice soil was treated with DNase I and then RNA was purified using a gel filtration column. The purified RNA was reverse-transcribed into single-strand cDNA and then ligated with an adaptor at each end before amplifying ds cDNA. The ds cDNA was sub-cloned for subsequent gene sequence analysis. We conducted qPCR to amplify 16S ribosomal DNA and observed highly efficient amplification. These results show that the extraction method can be optimized to isolate and obtain high-quality nucleic acids from microbes in different rhizosphere soils, suitable for genomic and post-genomic analyses.
23849113	The endoplasmic reticulum-quality control component SDF2 is essential for XA21-mediated immunity in rice.	2013	Plant Sci	Plant genomes contain large number of plasma membrane (PM)-localized immune receptors, also called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then translocated to the PM, where they recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate innate immune response. The rice XA21 immune receptor confers resistance to the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To identify components that mediate XA21-mediated signaling, we performed co-purification experiments using C-terminal GFP tagged XA21 protein. Several endoplasmic reticulum-quality control (ER-QC) proteins including stromal-derived factor 2 (SDF2) co-purified with XA21. Silencing of the SDF2 genes in the XA21 rice genetic background compromises resistance to Xoo but does not affect plant growth and development.
24013899	Effect of submerged and solid-state fermentation on pigment and citrinin production by Monascus purpureus.	2013	Acta Biol Hung	Monascus pigments, which are produced by various species of Monascus, often have been used as a natural colourant and as traditional natural food additives, especially in Southern China, Japan and Southeastern Asia. The limitation of wide using Monascus pigment is attributed to one of its secondary metabolites named citrinin. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of pigment and citrinin production via submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SF) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Monascus purpureus AS3.531. The optimal fermentation temperature and pH were significantly different for pigment production through different fermentation mode (35 °C, pH 5.0 for SF and 32 °C, pH 5.5 for SmF, respectively). Adding 2% (w/v) of glycerol in the medium could enhance the pigment production. On the optimized condition, although the concentration of citrinin produced by SmF (19.02 ug/g) increased more than 100 times than that by SF (0.018 ug/g), the pigment yield by SmF (7.93 U/g/g) could be comparable to that by SF (6.63 U/g/g). Those indicate us that fermentation mode seems to be the primary factor which influence the citrinin yield and secondary factor for pigment production.
24024469	Perturbation of Brachypodium distachyon CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A4 or 7 results in abnormal cell walls.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Cellulose is an integral component of the plant cell wall and accounts for approximately forty percent of total plant biomass but understanding its mechanism of synthesis remains elusive. CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins function as catalytic subunits of a rosette-shaped complex that synthesizes cellulose at the plasma membrane. Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) secondary wall CESA loss-of-function mutants have weak stems and irregular or thin cell walls.

RESULTS: Here, we identify candidates for secondary wall CESAs in Brachypodium distachyon as having similar amino acid sequence and expression to those characterized in A. thaliana, namely CESA4/7/8. To functionally characterize BdCESA4 and BdCESA7, we generated loss-of-function mutants using artificial microRNA constructs, specifically targeting each gene driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter. Presence of the transgenes reduced BdCESA4 and BdCESA7 transcript abundance, as well as stem area, cell wall thickness of xylem and fibers, and the amount of crystalline cellulose in the cell wall.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest BdCESA4 and BdCESA7 play a key role in B. distachyon secondary cell wall biosynthesis.
24086651	Cell wall degrading enzyme induced rice innate immune responses are suppressed by the type 3 secretion system effectors XopN, XopQ, XopX and XopZ of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2013	PLoS One	Innate immune responses are induced in plants and animals through perception of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns. These immune responses are suppressed by pathogens during infection. A number of studies have focussed on identifying functions of plant pathogenic bacteria that are involved in suppression of Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern induced immune responses. In comparison, there is very little information on functions used by plant pathogens to suppress Damage Associated Molecular Pattern induced immune responses. Xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzae, a gram negative bacterial pathogen of rice, secretes hydrolytic enzymes such as LipA (Lipase/Esterase) that damage rice cell walls and induce innate immune responses. Here, we show that Agrobacterium mediated transient transfer of the gene for XopN, a X. oryzae pv. oryzae type 3 secretion (T3S) system effector, results in suppression of rice innate immune responses induced by LipA. A xopN (-) mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae retains the ability to suppress these innate immune responses indicating the presence of other functionally redundant proteins. In transient transfer assays, we have assessed the ability of 15 other X. oryzae pv. oryzae T3S secreted effectors to suppress rice innate immune responses. Amongst these proteins, XopQ, XopX and XopZ are suppressors of LipA induced innate immune responses. A mutation in any one of the xopN, xopQ, xopX or xopZ genes causes partial virulence deficiency while a xopN (-) xopX (-) double mutant exhibits a greater virulence deficiency. A xopN (-) xopQ (-) xopX (-) xopZ (-) quadruple mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae induces callose deposition, an innate immune response, similar to a X. oryzae pv. oryzae T3S(-) mutant in rice leaves. Overall, these results indicate that multiple T3S secreted proteins of X. oryzae pv. oryzae can suppress cell wall damage induced rice innate immune responses.
24039714	Stratification requirements for seed dormancy alleviation in a wetland weed.	2013	PLoS One	Echinochloaoryzicola(syn.E. phyllopogon) is an exotic weed of California rice paddies that has evolved resistance to multiple herbicides. Elimination of seedlingsthroughcertain weed control methods can limit the spread of this weed, but is contingent on accurate predictions of germination and emergence timing, which are influenced by seed dormancy levels.In summer annuals, dormancy can often be relieved through stratification, a period of prolonged exposure to cold and moist conditions.We used population-based threshold models to quantify the effects of stratification on seed germination of four E. Oryzicola populations at a range of water potential (Ψ) and oxygen levels. We also determined how stratification temperatures, moisture levels and durations contributed to dormancy release. Stratification released dormancy by decreasing base Ψ and hydrotimerequired for germination and by eliminating any germination sensitivity to oxygen. Stratification also increased average germination rates (GR), which were used as a proxy for relative dormancy levels. Alternating temperatures nearly doubled GR in all populations, indicating that seeds could be partially dormant despite achieving high final germination percentages. Stratification at Ψ = 0 MPa increased GR compared to stratification at lower water potentials, demonstrating that Ψ contributed to regulating dormancy release. Maximum GR occurred after 2-4 weeks of stratification at 0 MPa; GR were often more rapid for herbicide-resistant than for herbicide-susceptible seeds, implying greater dormancy in the latter. Manipulation of field conditions to promote dormancy alleviation of E. oryzicola seeds might improve the rate and uniformity of germination for seed bank depletion through seedling weed control. Our results suggest field soil saturation in winter would contribute towards E. oryzicola dormancy release and decrease the time to seedling emergence.
24102419	Suppression of glycolate oxidase causes glyoxylate accumulation that inhibits photosynthesis through deactivating Rubisco in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme for photorespiration in plants. Previous studies have demonstrated that suppression of GLO causes photosynthetic inhibition, and the accumulated glycolate with the deactivated Rubisco is likely involved in the regulation. Using isolated Rubisco and chloroplasts, it has been found that only glyoxylate can effectively inactivate Rubisco and meanwhile inhibit photosynthesis, but little in vivo evidence has been acquired and reported. In this study, we have generated the transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants with GLO being constitutively silenced, and conducted the physiological and biochemical analyses on these plants to explore the regulatory mechanism. When GLO was downregulated, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) was reduced and the plant growth was correspondingly stunted. Surprisingly, glyoxylate, as a product of the GLO catalysis, was accumulated in response to the GLO suppression, like its substrate glycolate. Furthermore, the glyoxylate content was found to be inversely proportional to the Pn while the Pn is directly proportional to the Rubisco activation state in the GLO-suppressed plants. A mathematical fitting equation using least square method also demonstrated that the Rubisco activation state was inversely proportional to the glyoxylate content. Despite that the further analyses we have conducted failed to reveal how glyoxylate was accumulated in response to the GLO suppression, the current results do strongly suggest that there may exist an unidentified, alternative pathway to produce glyoxylate, and that the accumulated glyoxylate inhibits photosynthesis by deactivating Rubisco, and causes the photorespiratory phenotype in the GLO-suppressed rice plants.
24043125	Fungal diversity of rice straw for meju fermentation.	2013	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Rice straw is closely associated with meju fermentation and it is generally known that the rice straw provides meju with many kinds of microorganisms. In order to elucidate the origin of meju fungi, the fungal diversity of rice straw was examined. Rice straw was collected from 12 Jang factories where meju are produced, and were incubated under nine different conditions by altering the media (MEA, DRBC, and DG18), and temperature (15°C, 25°C, and 35°C). In total, 937 strains were isolated and identified as belonging to 39 genera and 103 species. Among these, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Eurotium, Fusarium, and Penicillium were the dominant genera. Fusarium asiaticum (56.3%), Cladosporium cladosporioides (48.6%), Aspergillus tubingensis (37.5%), A. oryzae (31.9%), Eurotium repens (27.1%), and E. chevalieri (25.0%) were frequently isolated from the rice straw obtained from many factories. Twelve genera and 40 species of fungi that were isolated in the rice straw in this study were also isolated from meju. Specifically, A. oryzae, C. cladosporioides, E. chevalieri, E. repens, F. asiaticum, and Penicillium polonicum (11.8%), which are abundant species in meju, were also isolated frequently from rice straw. C. cladosporioides, F. asiaticum, and P. polonicum, which are abundant in the low temperature fermentation process of meju fermentation, were frequently isolated from rice straw incubated at 15°C and 25°C, whereas A. oryzae, E. repens, and E. chevalieri, which are abundant in the high temperature fermentation process of meju fermentation, were frequently isolated from rice straw incubated at 25°C and 35°C. This suggests that the mycobiota of rice straw has a large influence in the mycobiota of meju. The influence of fungi on the rice straw as feed and silage for livestock, and as plant pathogens for rice, are discussed as well.
24073880	Mycosphaerella graminicola LysM effector-mediated stealth pathogenesis subverts recognition through both CERK1 and CEBiP homologues in wheat.	2014	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Fungal cell-wall chitin is a well-recognized pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Recognition of chitin in plants by pattern recognition receptors activates pathogen-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis, this process is mediated by a plasma membrane receptor kinase, CERK1, whereas in rice, a receptor-like protein, CEBiP, in addition to CERK1 is required. Secreted chitin-binding lysin motif (LysM) containing fungal effector proteins, such as Ecp6 from the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum, have been reported to interfere with PTI. Here, we identified wheat homologues of CERK1 and CEBiP and investigated their role in the interaction with the nonbiotrophic pathogen of wheat Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym Zymoseptoria tritici). We show that silencing of either CERK1 or CEBiP in wheat, using Barley stripe mosaic virus-mediated virus-induced gene silencing, is sufficient in allowing leaf colonization by the normally nonpathogenic M. graminicola Mg3LysM (homologue of Ecp6) deletion mutant, while the Mg1LysM deletion mutant was fully pathogenic toward both silenced and wild-type wheat leaves. These data indicate that Mg3LysM is important for fungal evasion of PTI in wheat leaf tissue and that both CERK1 and CEBiP are required for activation of chitin-induced defenses, a feature conserved between rice and wheat, and perhaps, also in other cereal species.
24124491	Homologous pairing activities of two rice RAD51 proteins, RAD51A1 and RAD51A2.	2013	PLoS One	In higher eukaryotes, RAD51 functions as an essential protein in homologous recombination and recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks. During these processes, RAD51 catalyzes homologous pairing between single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA. Japonica cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa) encode two RAD51 proteins, RAD51A1 and RAD51A2, whereas only one RAD51 exists in yeast and mammals. However, the functional differences between RAD51A1 and RAD51A2 have not been elucidated, because their biochemical properties have not been characterized. In the present study, we purified RAD51A1 and RAD51A2, and found that RAD51A2 robustly promotes homologous pairing in vitro. RAD51A1 also possesses homologous-pairing activity, but it is only about 10% of the RAD51A2 activity. Both RAD51A1 and RAD51A2 bind to ssDNA and dsDNA, and their DNA binding strictly requires ATP, which modulates the polymer formation activities of RAD51A1 and RAD51A2. These findings suggest that although both RAD51A1 and RAD51A2 have the potential to catalyze homologous pairing, RAD51A2 may be the major recombinase in rice.
24083809	Yusho patients show increased serum IL-17, IL-23, IL-1β, and TNFα levels more than 40 years after accidental polychlorinated biphenyl poisoning.	None	J Immunotoxicol	The Yusho poisoning incident, caused by rice oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated quarterphenyls (PCQs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) generated by heat-denatured PCBs, occurred in 1968 in western Japan. Although severe symptoms are rarely observed today, the levels of PCBs and PCDFs in the sera of Yusho patients remain high. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which also acts as a dioxin receptor, is a transcriptional regulator that mediates dioxin toxicity. Recent studies show that dioxin mediates its immune toxic effects via AhR and that AhR activation induces dysregulation of interleukin (IL)-17- producing T (TH17) cells. This study therefore hypothesized that Yusho patients would show dysregulated TH17 cell-mediated immune responses. To validate the hypothesis, levels of IL-17 and IL-22, each secreted by TH17 cells, along with IL-1β and IL-23 were measured in serum samples from 40 Yusho patients and 40 age-matched controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α potentially secreted by TH17 cell-stimulated neutrophils and macrophages were also measured. The results indicated that serum IL-17 levels, as well as those of IL-1β, IL-23, and TNFα, were significantly higher in Yusho patients than in controls. In contrast, serum IL-22 levels were significantly lower in the Yusho patients. These results suggest that Yusho patients have dysregulated TH17 cell-mediated immune responses that may be linked to inflammation.
24134674	Cellular localization and kinetics of the rice melatonin biosynthetic enzymes SNAT and ASMT.	2014	J Pineal Res	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) are the final two enzymes in the melatonin synthesis pathway in plants. Although their corresponding genes have been cloned, their cellular localization and enzymatic characteristics are unknown. Using confocal microscopy, we showed that SNAT protein is localized in chloroplasts, whereas ASMT is expressed in the cytoplasm. In vitro measurement of ASMT enzyme activity revealed a peak of activity in roots, but SNAT enzyme activity was not detected in any plant tissues. This may be attributed in part to an effect of chlorophyll because SNAT enzyme activity was greatly inhibited by chlorophyll in a dose-dependent manner. Because the SNAT protein of cyanobacteria is thermophilic, we examined the effect of temperature on the activity of the rice SNAT and ASMT enzymes. Purified recombinant rice SNAT and ASMT enzymes had an optimum temperature for activity of 55°C. The Km and Vmax values for SNAT at 55°C were 270 μm and 3.3 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas the Km and Vmax for ASMT were 222 μm and 9 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The catalytic efficiency (Vmax /Km ) values of SNAT and ASMT were 16-fold and 4054-fold higher at 55°C than at 30°C suggestive of increased melatonin production at high temperature in plants.
24270630	The distribution of different classes of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in diverse organisms and the utilization of the minor NLS-binding site inplantnuclear import factor importin-α.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	The specific recognition between the import receptor importin-α and the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) is crucial to ensure the selective transport of cargoes into the nucleus. NLSs contain 1 or 2 clusters of positively charged amino acids, which usually bind to the major (monopartite NLSs) or both minor and major NLS-binding sites (bipartite NLSs). In our recent study, we determined the structure of importin-α1a from rice (Oryza sativa), and made 2 observations that suggest an increased utilization of the minor NLS-binding site in this protein. First, unlike the mammalian protein, both the major and minor NLS-binding sites are auto-inhibited in the unliganded rice protein. Second, we showed that NLSs of the "plant-specific" class preferentially bind to the minor NLS-binding site of rice importin-α. Here, we show that a distinct group of "minor site-specific" NLSs also bind to the minor site of the rice protein. We further show a greater enrichment of proteins containing these "plant-specific" and "minor site-specific" NLSs in the rice proteome. However, the analysis of the distribution of different classes of NLSs in diverse eukaryotes shows that in all organisms, the minor site-specific NLSs are much less prevalent than the classical monopartite and bipartite NLSs.
24173698	Ascorbate metabolism in rice genotypes differing in zinc efficiency.	2014	Planta	Effects of zinc (Zn) deficiency on shoot metabolites were investigated in contrasting rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes with special focus on ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis, recycling, and catabolism. The genotypes IR74 (sensitive) and RIL46 (tolerant) were subjected to -Zn and control treatments for 3 weeks, and samples were taken at three different stages representing the pre-stress phase, emergence of visible stress, and severe visible stress. The emergence of visible symptoms was paralleled by an increase in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in AsA concentration in the sensitive, but not in the tolerant genotype. The tolerant RIL46 showed enhanced transcript levels of several genes involved in the mannose/L-galactose pathway to AsA biosynthesis, and significant up-regulation of a gene involved in the putative alternative myo-inositol pathway under low Zn stress. The level of most AsA precursors was negatively affected by Zn deficiency, but RIL46 had a constitutively higher level of non-phosphorylated precursors. Products of AsA catabolism such as oxalate and threonate did not accumulate in either genotype, suggesting that AsA degradation did not contribute to the stress-induced decline of the AsA pool in IR74. Further factors possibly contributing to tolerance in RIL46 included an almost fivefold higher proline level under -Zn stress and significantly higher trehalose content. The implications of these compounds in AsA metabolism and Zn efficiency thus deserve further attention.
24032669	A survey of mycotoxins in domestic rice in Iran by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.	2014	Toxicol Mech Methods	In this study, a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was applied for the simultaneous detection and quantification of a broad spectrum of mycotoxins and fungal metabolites in domestic rice in Iran. A total of 20 fungal metabolites were detected in 65 rice samples. The result showed that all of the samples were contaminated to at least one mycotoxin. The most prevalent fungal metabolites were brevianamide F (81.5%), emodin (46.1%) and tryptophol (43.1%). The occurrence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) was 21.5%, 4.6%, 29.2% and 9.2%, respectively. No detectable level of deoxynivelenol was found in any of the samples. The mean level of regulated mycotoxins was lower than the maximum limit. Co-occurrence of AF1-ZEN, ZEN-OTA and FB1-ZEN were observed in 4.6%, 3.1% and 4.6% of samples, respectively. This is the first report indicating the contamination of domestic rice in Iran with mycotoxins such as alternaria metabolites, citrinin, tryptophol and kojic acid.
24093800	Transcriptome analysis of heat stress response in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.).	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Global warming predictions indicate that temperatures will increase by another 2-6°C by the end of this century. High temperature is a major abiotic stress limiting plant growth and productivity in many areas of the world. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a model herbaceous bioenergy crop, due to its rapid growth rate, reliable biomass yield, minimal requirements of water and nutrients, adaptability to grow on marginal lands and widespread distribution throughout North America. The effect of high temperature on switchgrass physiology, cell wall composition and biomass yields has been reported. However, there is void in the knowledge of the molecular responses to heat stress in switchgrass.

RESULTS: We conducted long-term heat stress treatment (38°/30°C, day/night, for 50 days) in the switchgrass cultivar Alamo. A significant decrease in the plant height and total biomass was evident in the heat stressed plants compared to controls. Total RNA from control and heat stress samples were used for transcriptome analysis with switchgrass Affymetrix genechips. Following normalization and pre-processing, 5365 probesets were identified as differentially expressed using a 2-fold cutoff. Of these, 2233 probesets (2000 switchgrass unigenes) were up-regulated, and 3132 probesets (2809 unigenes) were down-regulated. Differential expression of 42 randomly selected genes from this list was validated using RT-PCR. Rice orthologs were retrieved for 78.7% of the heat stress responsive switchgrass probesets. Gene ontology (GOs) enrichment analysis using AgriGO program showed that genes related to ATPase regulator, chaperone binding, and protein folding was significantly up-regulated. GOs associated with protein modification, transcription, phosphorus and nitrogen metabolic processes, were significantly down-regulated by heat stress.

CONCLUSIONS: Plausible connections were identified between the identified GOs, physiological responses and heat response phenotype observed in switchgrass plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis in response to heat stress among four monocots - switchgrass, rice, wheat and maize identified 16 common genes, most of which were associated with protein refolding processes. These core genes will be valuable biomarkers for identifying heat sensitive plant germplasm since they are responsive to both short duration as well as chronic heat stress treatments, and are also expressed in different plant growth stages and tissue types.
24173642	Crystal structure of XoLAP, a leucine aminopeptidase, from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2013	J Microbiol	Aminopeptidases are metalloproteinases that degrade N-terminal residues from protein and play important roles in cell growth and development by controlling cell homeostasis and protein maturation. We determined the crystal structure of XoLAP, a leucyl aminopeptidase, at 2.6 Å resolution from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing the destructive rice disease of bacterial blight. It is the first crystal structure of aminopeptidase from phytopathogens as a drug target. XoLAP existed as a hexamer and the monomer structure consisted of an N-terminal cap domain and a C-terminal peptidase domain with two divalent zinc ions. XoLAP structure was compared with BlLAP and EcLAP (EcPepA) structures. Based on the structural comparison, the molecular model of XoLAP in complex with the natural aminopeptidase inhibitor of microginin FR1 was proposed. The model structure will be useful to develop a novel antibacterial drug against Xoo.
24141117	An efficient method for organic acetylation and use of DL-phosphinothricin as a negative selection agent in argE transgenic rice.	2013	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	We present an efficient method for the production of N-acetyl-L-phosphinothricin (N-AcPt) from commercial DL-phosphinothricin (DL-PPT) by organic acetylation for use as a negative selection agent (NSA) that induces cell death in argE transgenic rice. DL-PPT was efficiently converted into N-AcPt with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetic anhydride (Ac2O). Chemical changes were confirmed using NMR and ATR-FTIR analyses. DL-PPT was toxic but N-AcPt did not show cytotoxic effects on leaf discs or seed germination of wild-type rice. Conversely, in argE-hpt transgenic rice, non-toxic N-AcPt showed the negative selection (NS) effect by inducing cell destruction in leaf discs and restricting seed germination. For inducing NS, ≥0.1 mg ml(-1) and ≥0.5 mg ml(-1) of N-AcPt were effective in leaf and seed assays, respectively. Further, the NS effect occurred faster in the leaf assay compared with the seed germination assay, again indicating the leaf assay was a more sensitive indicator of N-AcPt as an NSA to argE transgenic rice than the seed germination assay. This negative selection approach could be useful for the development of selectable marker free transgenic plants in the economically important monocot species and its commercialization for multiple gene transformation.
24140150	Two conidiation-related Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor genes in the rice blast fungus.	2013	Fungal Genet Biol	Regulation of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs) helps plant pathogens to interact with the host plants and to sustain a pathogenic lifestyle in the environmental changes. Elucidating novel functions of TFs is, therefore, crucial for understanding pathogenesis mechanisms of plant pathogens. Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, undergoes a series of developmental morphogenesis to complete its infection cycle. To understand TF genes implicated in pathogenic development of this fungus, two Zn(II)2Cys6 TF genes, MoCOD1 and MoCOD2, whose expression was notably induced during conidiation, were functionally characterized. Targeted deletion of MoCOD1 resulted in defects in conidiation and pathogenicity due to defects in appressorium formation and invasive growth within the host cells. MoCOD2 was also a critical regulator in conidiation and pathogenicity, but not in conidial germination and appressorium formation. When rice plants were inoculated with conidia of the ΔMocod2 mutant, rapid accumulation of dark brown granules was observed around the infection sites in the plant cells and no visible disease symptom was incited. Taken together, both MoCOD1 and MoCOD2 play important roles in conidiation and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus.
24280045	Overexpression of constitutively active mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6 enhances tolerance to salt stress in rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Salinity is one of the most common abiotic stresses encountered by plants in the environment and transgenic approaches offer new opportunities to improve tolerance. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK) is a key component of MAPK cascade that plays important roles in intra and extra cellular signaling in plants. In the present study, a MKK from rice (Oryza sativa), OsMKK6 was functionally characterized in salt stress by transforming its constitutively active form.

FINDINGS: OsMKK6 was made constitutively active by mutating serine and threonine to glutamic acid by site directed mutagenesis, and transformed in indica cultivar rice var. Pusa Basmati-1. The transgenic seedlings growing in 200 mM NaCl solution showed increased root/shoot length and weight, less chlorophyll beaching and higher MAPK activity compared to the wild types.

CONCLUSION: Present work suggest role of OsMKK6 gene in salt stress signaling in rice.
24102635	Identification of genes for melatonin synthetic enzymes in 'Red Fuji' apple (Malus domestica Borkh.cv.Red) and their expression and melatonin production during fruit development.	2013	J Pineal Res	Melatonin is present in many edible fruits; however, the presence of melatonin in apple has not previously been reported. In this study, the genes for melatonin synthetic enzymes including tryptophan decarboxylase, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H), arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, and N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase were identified in 'Red Fuji' apple. Each gene has several homologous genes. Sequence analysis shows that these genes have little homology with those of animals and they only have limited homology with known genes of rice melatonin synthetic enzymes. Multiple origins of melatonin synthetic genes during the evolution are expected. The expression of these genes is fully coordinated with melatonin production in apple development. Melatonin levels in apple exhibit an inverse relationship with the content of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation. Two major melatonin synthetic peaks appeared on July 17 and on October 8 in both unbagged and bagged apple samples. At the periods mentioned above, apples experienced rapid expansion and increased respiration. These episodes significantly elevate reactive oxygen species production in the apple. Current data further confirmed that melatonin produced in apple was used to neutralize the toxic oxidants and protect the developing apple against oxidative stress.
24098112	Glycogen metabolic genes are involved in trehalose-6-phosphate synthase-mediated regulation of pathogenicity by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	PLoS Pathog	The filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease. Here we show that glycogen metabolic genes play an important role in plant infection by M. oryzae. Targeted deletion of AGL1 and GPH1, which encode amyloglucosidase and glycogen phosphorylase, respectively, prevented mobilisation of glycogen stores during appressorium development and caused a significant reduction in the ability of M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease. By contrast, targeted mutation of GSN1, which encodes glycogen synthase, significantly reduced the synthesis of intracellular glycogen, but had no effect on fungal pathogenicity. We found that loss of AGL1 and GPH1 led to a reduction in expression of TPS1 and TPS3, which encode components of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase complex, that acts as a genetic switch in M. oryzae. Tps1 responds to glucose-6-phosphate levels and the balance of NADP/NADPH to regulate virulence-associated gene expression, in association with Nmr transcriptional inhibitors. We show that deletion of the NMR3 transcriptional inhibitor gene partially restores virulence to a Δagl1Δgph1 mutant, suggesting that glycogen metabolic genes are necessary for operation of the NADPH-dependent genetic switch in M. oryzae.
24090005	Molecular identification of Pomacea canaliculata and P. insularum from rice paddy in different origins in China using mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate subunit 6 gene.	2015	Mitochondrial DNA	To identify Pomacea canaliculata and P. insularum using a molecular approach, the partial sequences of mitochondrial (mt) adenosine triphosphate subunit 6 (patp6) genes of two apple snails species from eight provinces of China were obtained. The intra-specific variations in mt patp6 within P. canaliculata were 0-4.5%, and no sequence difference in this region was observed within P. insularum. However, high inter-specific variations between P. canaliculata and P. insularum were detected, with sequence differences of 8.9-10.1%. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of mt patp6 revealed that P. canaliculata and P. insularum were grouped in different clades, but the genetic trees could not reveal geographically genetic relationships of P. canaliculata isolates from different origins. These findings will provide basic information for further study of molecular epidemiology and control of Pomacea invasion in China as well as in the world.
24098411	Natural variation of the RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 contributes to flowering time divergence in rice.	2013	PLoS One	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), there is a diversity in flowering time that is strictly genetically regulated. Some indica cultivars show extremely late flowering under long-day conditions, but little is known about the gene(s) involved. Here, we demonstrate that functional defects in the florigen gene RFT1 are the main cause of late flowering in an indica cultivar, Nona Bokra. Mapping and complementation studies revealed that sequence polymorphisms in the RFT1 regulatory and coding regions are likely to cause late flowering under long-day conditions. We detected polymorphisms in the promoter region that lead to reduced expression levels of RFT1. We also identified an amino acid substitution (E105K) that leads to a functional defect in Nona Bokra RFT1. Sequencing of the RFT1 region in rice accessions from a global collection showed that the E105K mutation is found only in indica, and indicated a strong association between the RFT1 haplotype and extremely late flowering in a functional Hd1 background. Furthermore, SNPs in the regulatory region of RFT1 and the E105K substitution in 1,397 accessions show strong linkage disequilibrium with a flowering time-associated SNP. Although the defective E105K allele of RFT1 (but not of another florigen gene, Hd3a) is found in many cultivars, relative rate tests revealed no evidence for differential rate of evolution of these genes. The ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions suggest that the E105K mutation resulting in the defect in RFT1 occurred relatively recently. These findings indicate that natural mutations in RFT1 provide flowering time divergence under long-day conditions.
24164672	Precise marker excision system using an animal-derived piggyBac transposon in plants.	2014	Plant J	Accurate and effective positive marker excision is indispensable for the introduction of desired mutations into the plant genome via gene targeting (GT) using a positive/negative counter selection system. In mammals, the moth-derived piggyBac transposon system has been exploited successfully to eliminate a selectable marker from a GT locus without leaving a footprint. Here, we present evidence that the piggyBac transposon also functions in plant cells. To demonstrate the use of the piggyBac transposon for effective marker excision in plants, we designed a transposition assay system that allows the piggyBac transposition to be visualized as emerald luciferase (Eluc) luminescence in rice cells. The Eluc signal derived from piggyBac excision was observed in hyperactive piggyBac transposase-expressing rice calli. Polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot analyses and sequencing revealed the efficient and precise transposition of piggyBac in these calli. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the excision of a selection marker from a reporter locus in T0 plants without concomitant re-integration of the transposon and at a high frequency (44.0% of excision events), even in the absence of negative selection.
24094741	A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice.	2013	Dev Cell	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the natural auxin in plants, regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Extensive analyses have elucidated the components of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling, but the physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of auxin degradation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice. Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries. Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants. We show that recombinant DAO converts the active IAA into biologically inactive 2-oxoindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) in vitro. Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development.
24132150	A comparative proteomic analysis of Pinellia ternata leaves exposed to heat stress.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Pinellia ternata is an important traditional Chinese medicinal plant. The growth of P. ternata is sensitive to high temperatures. To gain a better understanding of heat stress responses in P. ternata, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis. P. ternata seedlings were subjected to a temperature of 38 °C and samples were collected 24 h after treatment. Increased relative ion leakage and lipid peroxidation suggested that oxidative stress was frequently generated in rice leaves exposed to high temperature. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to analyze heat-responsive proteins. More than 600 protein spots were reproducibly detected on each gel; of these spots, 20 were up-regulated, and 7 were down-regulated. A total of 24 proteins and protein species were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. These proteins and protein species were found to be primarily small heat shock proteins (58%) as well as proteins involved in RNA processing (17%), photosynthesis (13%), chlorophyll biosynthetic processes (4%), protein degradation (4%) and defense (4%). Using 2-DE Western blot analysis, we confirmed the identities of the cytosolic class II small heat shock protein (sHSPs-CII) identified by MS. The expression levels of four different proteins [cytosolic class I small heat shock protein (sHSPs-CI), sHSPs-CII, mitochondrial small heat shock protein (sHSPs-MIT), glycine-rich RNA-binding protein (GRP)] were analyzed at the transcriptional level by quantitative real-time PCR. The mRNA levels of three sHSPs correlated with the corresponding protein levels. However, GRP was down-regulated at the beginning of heat stress but then increased substantially to reach a peak after 24 h of heat stress. Our study provides valuable new insight into the responses of P. ternata to heat stress.
24102500	Thermochemistry and kinetics for 2-butanone-1-yl radical (CH2·C(═O)CH2CH3) reactions with O2.	2014	J Phys Chem A	Thermochemistry of reactants, intermediates, transition state structures, and products along with kinetics on the association of CH2·C(═O)CH2CH3 (2-butanone-1-yl) with O2 and dissociation of the peroxy adduct isomers are studied. Thermochemical properties are determined using ab initio (G3MP2B3 and G3) composite methods along with density functional theory (B3LYP/6-311g(d,p)). Entropy and heat capacity contributions versus temperature are determined from structures, vibration frequencies, and internal rotor potentials. The CH2·C(═O)CH2CH3 radical + O2 association results in a chemically activated peroxy radical with 27 kcal mol(-1) excess of energy. The chemically activated adduct can react to stabilized peroxy or hydroperoxide alkyl radical adducts, further react to lactones plus hydroxyl radical, or form olefinic ketones and a hydroperoxy radical. Kinetic parameters are determined from the G3 composite methods derived thermochemical parameters, and quantum Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel (QRRK) analysis to calculate k(E) with master equation analysis to evaluate falloff in the chemically activated and dissociation reactions. One new, not previously reported, peroxy chemistry reaction is presented. It has a low barrier path and involves a concerted reaction resulting in olefin formation, H2O elimination, and an alkoxy radical.
24151204	Strigolactone and cytokinin act antagonistically in regulating rice mesocotyl elongation in darkness.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of phytohormones that control plant growth and development including shoot branching. Previous studies of the phenotypes of SL-related rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf (d) mutants demonstrated that SLs inhibit mesocotyl elongation by controlling cell division. Here, we found that the expression of cytokinin (CK)-responsive type-A RESPONSE REGULATOR (RR) genes was higher in d10-1 and d14-1 mutants than in the wild type. However, CK levels in mesocotyls of the d mutants were not very different from those in the wild type. On the other hand, application of a synthetic CK (kinetin) enhanced mesocotyl elongation in the d mutants and the wild type. d10-1 and d14-1 mesocotyls were more sensitive to CK than wild-type mesocotyls, suggesting that the up-regulation of the CK-responsive type-A RR genes and the higher elongation of mesocotyls in the d mutants are mainly due to the increased sensitivity of the d mutants to CK. Co-treatment with kinetin and a synthetic SL (GR24) confirmed the antagonistic functions of SL and CK on mesocotyl elongation. OsTCP5, which encodes a transcription factor belonging to the cell division-regulating TCP family, was also regulated by SL and CK and its expression was negatively correlated with mesocotyl length. These findings suggest that OsTCP5 contributes to the SL- and CK-controlled mesocotyl elongation in darkness.
24155879	Putative DHHC-cysteine-rich domain S-acyltransferase in plants.	2013	PLoS One	Protein S-acyltransferases (PATs) containing Asp-His-His-Cys within a Cys-rich domain (DHHC-CRD) are polytopic transmembrane proteins that are found in eukaryotic cells and mediate the S-acylation of target proteins. S-acylation is an important secondary and reversible modification that regulates the membrane association, trafficking and function of target proteins. However, little is known about the characteristics of PATs in plants. Here, we identified 804 PATs from 31 species with complete genomes. The analysis of the phylogenetic relationships suggested that all of the PATs fell into 8 groups. In addition, we analysed the phylogeny, genomic organization, chromosome localisation and expression pattern of PATs in Arabidopsis, Oryza sative, Zea mays and Glycine max. The microarray data revealed that PATs genes were expressed in different tissues and during different life stages. The preferential expression of the ZmPATs in specific tissues and the response of Zea mays to treatments with phytohormones and abiotic stress demonstrated that the PATs play roles in plant growth and development as well as in stress responses. Our data provide a useful reference for the identification and functional analysis of the members of this protein family.
24089433	Survey of genes involved in rice secondary cell wall formation through a co-expression network.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	The plant secondary cell wall is the major source of lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable energy resource that can be used for bioethanol production. To comprehensively identify transcription factors (TFs), glycosyltransferase (GT) and glycosyl hydrolase (GH) involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice (Oryza sativa), co-expression network analysis was performed using 68 microarray data points for different rice tissues and stages. In addition to rice genes encoding orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana TFs known to regulate secondary cell wall formation, the network analysis suggested many novel TF genes likely to be involved in cell wall formation. In the accompanying paper (Hirano et al.), several of these TFs are shown to be involved in rice secondary cell wall formation. Based on a comparison of the rice and Arabidopsis networks, TFs were classified as common to both species or specific to each plant species, suggesting that in addition to a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism of cell wall formation, the two plants may also use species-specific groups of TFs during secondary wall formation. Similarly, genes encoding GT and GH were also classified as genes showing species-common or species-specific expression patterns. In addition, genes for primary or secondary cell wall formation were also suggested. The list of rice TF, GT and GH genes provides an opportunity to unveil the regulation of secondary cell wall formation in grasses, leading to optimization of the cell wall for biofuel production.
24168061	Genetic variation, linkage mapping of QTL and correlation studies for yield, root, and agronomic traits for aerobic adaptation.	2013	BMC Genet	BACKGROUND: Water scarcity and drought have seriously threatened traditional rice cultivation practices in several parts of the world, including India. Aerobic rice that uses significantly less water than traditional flooded systems has emerged as a promising water-saving technology. The identification of QTL conferring improved aerobic adaptation may facilitate the development of high-yielding aerobic rice varieties. In this study, experiments were conducted for mapping QTL for yield, root-related traits, and agronomic traits under aerobic conditions using HKR47 × MAS26 and MASARB25 × Pusa Basmati 1460 F2:3 mapping populations.

RESULTS: A total of 35 QTL associated with 14 traits were mapped on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11 in MASARB25 x Pusa Basmati 1460 and 14 QTL associated with 9 traits were mapped on chromosomes 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in HKR47 × MAS26. Two QTL (qGY8.1 with an R2 value of 34.0% and qGY2.1 with an R2 value of 22.8%) and one QTL (qGY2.2 with an R2 value of 43.2%) were identified for grain yield under aerobic conditions in the mapping populations MASARB25 × Pusa Basmati 1460 and HKR47 × MAS26, respectively.A number of breeding lines with higher yield per plant, root length, dry biomass, length-breadth ratio, and with Pusa Basmati 1460-specific alleles in a homozygous or heterozygous condition at the BAD2 locus were identified that will serve as novel material for the selection of stable aerobic Basmati rice breeding lines.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified positive correlation between some of the root traits and yield under aerobic conditions, indicating the role of root traits for improving yield under aerobic situations possibly through improved water and nutrient uptake. Co-localization of QTL for yield, root traits, and yield-related agronomic traits indicates that the identified QTL may be immediately exploited in marker-assisted-breeding to develop novel high-yielding aerobic rice varieties.
24088323	The large soybean (Glycine max) WRKY TF family expanded by segmental duplication events and subsequent divergent selection among subgroups.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: WRKY genes encode one of the most abundant groups of transcription factors in higher plants, and its members regulate important biological process such as growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Although the soybean genome sequence has been published, functional studies on soybean genes still lag behind those of other species.

RESULTS: We identified a total of 133 WRKY members in the soybean genome. According to structural features of their encoded proteins and to the phylogenetic tree, the soybean WRKY family could be classified into three groups (groups I, II, and III). A majority of WRKY genes (76.7%; 102 of 133) were segmentally duplicated and 13.5% (18 of 133) of the genes were tandemly duplicated. This pattern was not apparent in Arabidopsis or rice. The transcriptome atlas revealed notable differential expression in either transcript abundance or in expression patterns under normal growth conditions, which indicated wide functional divergence in this family. Furthermore, some critical amino acids were detected using DIVERGE v2.0 in specific comparisons, suggesting that these sites have contributed to functional divergence among groups or subgroups. In addition, site model and branch-site model analyses of positive Darwinian selection (PDS) showed that different selection regimes could have affected the evolution of these groups. Sites with high probabilities of having been under PDS were found in groups I, II c, II e, and III. Together, these results contribute to a detailed understanding of the molecular evolution of the WRKY gene family in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS: In this work, all the WRKY genes, which were generated mainly through segmental duplication, were identified in the soybean genome. Moreover, differential expression and functional divergence of the duplicated WRKY genes were two major features of this family throughout their evolutionary history. Positive selection analysis revealed that the different groups have different evolutionary rates. Together, these results contribute to a detailed understanding of the molecular evolution of the WRKY gene family in soybean.
24104396	Deep transcriptome sequencing of wild halophyte rice, Porteresia coarctata, provides novel insights into the salinity and submergence tolerance factors.	2014	DNA Res	Porteresia coarctata is a wild relative of rice with capability of high salinity and submergence tolerance. The transcriptome analyses of Porteresia can lead to the identification of candidate genes involved in salinity and submergence tolerance. We sequenced the transcriptome of Porteresia under different conditions using Illumina platform and generated about 375 million high-quality reads. After optimized assembly, a total of 152 367 unique transcript sequences with average length of 794 bp were obtained. Many of these sequences might represent fragmented transcripts. Functional annotation revealed the presence of genes involved in diverse cellular processes and 2749 transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes in Porteresia. The differential gene expression analyses identified a total of 15 158 genes involved in salinity and/or submergence response(s). The stress-responsive members of different TF families, including MYB, bHLH, AP2-EREBP, WRKY, bZIP and NAC, were identified. We also revealed key metabolic pathways, including amino acid biosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall structures, involved in stress tolerance in Porteresia. The transcriptome analyses of Porteresia are expected to highlight genes/pathways involved in salinity and submergence tolerance of this halophyte species. The data can serve as a resource for unravelling the underlying mechanism and devising strategies to engineer salinity and submergence tolerance in rice.
24059703	Ab initio chemical kinetics for SiH2 + Si2H6 and SiH3 + Si2H5 reactions and the related unimolecular decomposition of Si3H8 under a-Si/H CVD conditions.	2013	J Phys Chem A	The kinetics and mechanisms for SiH2 + Si2H6 and SiH3 + Si2H5 reactions and the related unimolecular decomposition of Si3H8 have been investigated by ab initio molecular orbital theory based on the QCISD(T)/CBS//QCISD/6-311++G(d,p) method in conjunction with quantum statistical variational Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) calculations. For the barrierless radical association processes, their variational transition states have been characterized by the CASPT2//CASSCF method. The species involved in the study are known to coexist under CVD conditions. The results show that the association reaction of SiH2 and Si2H6 producing Si3H8 occurs by insertion via its lowest-energy path forming a loose hydrogen-bonding molecular complex with 8.3 kcal/mol binding energy; the reaction is exothermic by 55.0 kcal/mol. The chemically activated Si3H8 adduct can fragment by several paths, producing SiH4 + SiH3SiH (-0.7 kcal/mol), Si(SiH3)2 + H2 (-1.4 kcal/mol), and SiH3SiH2SiH + H2 (-1.4 kcal/mol). The predicted enthalpy changes as given agree well with available thermochemical data. Three other decomposition channels of Si3H8 occurring by Si-H or Si-Si breaking were found to be highly endothermic, and the reactions take place without a well-defined barrier. The heats of formation of Si3H8, SiH2SiH, Si2H4, i-Si3H7, n-Si3H7, Si(SiH3)2, and SiH3SiH2SiH have been predicted and found to be in close agreement with those available data in the literature. The product branching rate constants for SiH2 + Si2H6 and SiH3 + Si2H5 reactions and the thermal unimolecular decomposition of Si3H8 for all low-energy paths have been calculated with multichannel variational RRKM theory covering varying P,T conditions typically employed in PECVD and Cat-CVD processes for hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si/H) film growth. The results were also found to be in good agreement with available kinetic data. Our kinetic results may be employed to model and control very large-area a-Si/H film growth for a new generation of solar cell applications.
24130197	Rice WRKY13 regulates cross talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways by selective binding to different cis-elements.	2013	Plant Physiol	Plants use a complex signal transduction network to regulate their adaptation to the ever-changing environment. Rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY13 plays a vital role in the cross talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways by suppressing abiotic stress resistance and activating disease resistance. However, it is not clear how WRKY13 directly regulates this cross talk. Here, we show that WRKY13 is a transcriptional repressor. During the rice responses to drought stress and bacterial infection, WRKY13 selectively bound to certain site- and sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of SNAC1 (for STRESS RESPONSIVE NO APICAL MERISTEM, ARABIDOPSIS TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION FACTOR1/2, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON), the overexpression of which increases drought resistance, and WRKY45-1, the knockout of which increases both bacterial disease and drought resistance. WRKY13 also bound to two cis-elements of its native promoter to autoregulate the balance of its gene expression in different physiological activities. WRKY13 was induced in leaf vascular tissue, where bacteria proliferate, during infection, and in guard cells, where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 enhances drought resistance, during both bacterial infection and drought stress. These results suggest that WRKY13 regulates the antagonistic cross talk between drought and disease resistance pathways by directly suppressing SNAC1 and WRKY45-1 and autoregulating its own expression via site- and sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of these genes in vascular tissue where bacteria proliferate and guard cells where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 mediates drought resistance by promoting stomatal closure.
24280004	Temporal profiling of primary metabolites under chilling stress and its association with seedling chilling tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Chilling stress is a major factor limiting rice production. Rice genotypes differ greatly in their seedling chilling tolerance (CT), which is known to involve differential expression of large numbers of genes and proteins. To further understand the metabolomic responses of rice to chilling stress, profiles of the 106 primary metabolites of a CT japonica variety, Lijiangxintuanhegu (LTH) and a chilling sensitive indica line, IR29, were investigated under a time-series of chilling stress and non-stress control conditions at the seedling stage.

RESULTS: We identified 106 primary metabolites that were temporally and genotype-dependently regulated in LTH and IR29 under the time-series chilling stress and subsequent recovery. Three major groups of primary metabolites, amino acids (AAs), organic acids (OAs) and sugars, showed distinct change patterns in both genotypes in response to the chilling stress: a more general accumulation of most AAs, more dramatic decreased levels of most OAs, and greatly reduced levels for most sugars at early time points of stress but increased levels of specific sugars at the later time points of stress. Compared to IR29, LTH had more metabolites showing chilling induced changes, greater levels of these metabolomic changes and a greater ability to recover after stress, implying that LTH used a positive energy-saving strategy against chilling stress. During subsequent recovery, more metabolites were significantly and exclusively up-regulated in LTH, indicating their positive role in chilling tolerance. A comparative analysis of these metabolites data and differentially expressed genes data allowed identification of 7 AAs and related genes that were both chilling responsive and contributed greatly to the CT of LTH.

CONCLUSIONS: The metabolomic responses of rice to chilling stress at the seedling stage were dynamic and involved large numbers of the metabolites. The chilling induced changes of three major groups of metabolites, AAs, OAs and sugars, in rice were well coordinated. The high level seedling CT of LTH was apparently attributed to its increased levels of most AAs and reduced energy consumption that resulted in increased glycolysis and strong resilience on recovery. The results of this study extend our understanding of molecular mechanisms of chilling stress tolerance in rice.
24142111	Two rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7, are involved in transport and providing tolerance to boron toxicity.	2014	Planta	Boron (B) toxicity is responsible for low cereal crop production in a number of regions worldwide. In this report, we characterized two rice genes, OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7, for their involvement in B permeability and tolerance. Transcript analysis demonstrated that the expression of OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 were downregulated in shoots and strongly upregulated in rice roots by high B treatment. Expression of both OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 in yeast HD9 strain lacking Fps1, ACR3, and Ycf1 resulted in an increased B sensitivity. Furthermore, yeast HD9 strain expressing OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 accumulated significantly higher B as compared to empty vector control, which suggests their involvement in B transport. Overexpression of OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis imparted higher tolerance under B toxicity. Arabidopsis lines overexpressing OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 showed significantly higher biomass production and greater root length, however there was no difference in B accumulation in long term uptake assay. Short-term uptake assay using tracer B (¹⁰B) in shoots and roots demonstrated increased ¹⁰B accumulation in Arabidopsis lines expressing OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7, compare to wild type control plants. Efflux assay of B in the roots showed that ¹⁰B was effluxed from the Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsPIP2;4 or OsPIP2;7 during the initial 1-h of assay. These data indicate that OsPIP2;4 and OsPIP2;7 are involved in mediating B transport in rice and provide tolerance via efflux of excess B from roots and shoot tissues. These genes will be highly useful in developing B tolerant crops for enhanced yield in the areas affected by high B toxicity.
24117535	Tissue distribution of hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus of shrimp in freshwater rice-field crab, Paratelphusa hydrodomous (Herbst).	2014	J Fish Dis	An attempt was made to determine the replication efficiency of hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus (HPV) of shrimp in different organs of freshwater rice-field crab Paratelphusa hydrodomous (Herbst) using bioassay, PCR, RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot and q-PCR analyses. Another attempt was made to use this crab as an alternative to penaeid shrimp for the large-scale production of HPV. This crab was found to be highly susceptible to HPV by intramuscular injection. The systemic HPV infection was confirmed by PCR and Western blot analyses in freshwater crab. The expression of capsid protein gene in different organs of infected crab was revealed by RT-PCR analysis. Indirect ELISA was used to quantify the capsid protein in different organs of the crab. The copy number of HPV in different organs of the infected crab was quantified by q-PCR. The results revealed a steady decrease in CT values in different organs of the infected crab during the course of infection. The viral inoculum that was prepared from different organs of the infected crab caused significant mortality in post-larvae of tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon (Fabricius). The results revealed that this rice-field crab could be used as an alternative host for HPV replication and also for large-scale production of HPV.
24096657	Polishing properties of sake rice Koshitanrei for high-quality sake brewing.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	The Japanese high-quality sake Daiginjo-shu is made from highly polished rice (polishing ratio, less than 50%). Here we showed that the sake rice Koshitanrei (KOS) has an excellent polishing property. Rice grains of KOS had the same lined white-core region as the sake rice Yamadanishiki (YAM). The grain rigidity/hardness of KOS was higher than that of the sake rice Gohyakumangoku (GOM). The loss ratio of KOS after high polishing by an industrial polishing machine was lower than that of GOM. Further, a clear taste of sake produced from KOS was confirmed by sensory evaluation.
24089437	Maize LAZY1 mediates shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development through regulating auxin transport, auxin signaling, and light response.	2013	Plant Physiol	Auxin is a plant hormone that plays key roles in both shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development. However, these two processes appear to be parallel and to be regulated by distinct players. Here, we report that the maize (Zea mays) prostrate stem1 mutant, which is allelic to the classic mutant lazy plant1 (la1), displays prostrate growth with reduced shoot gravitropism and defective inflorescence development. Map-based cloning identified maize ZmLA1 as the functional ortholog of LAZY1 in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). It has a unique role in inflorescence development and displays enriched expression in reproductive organs such as tassels and ears. Transcription of ZmLA1 responds to auxin and is repressed by light. Furthermore, ZmLA1 physically interacts with a putative auxin transport regulator in the plasma membrane and a putative auxin signaling protein in the nucleus. RNA-SEQ data showed that dozens of auxin transport, auxin response, and light signaling genes were differentially expressed in la1 mutant stems. Therefore, ZmLA1 might mediate the cross talk between shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development by regulating auxin transport, auxin signaling, and probably light response in maize.
24116181	The MET13 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is essential for infection-related morphogenesis in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	PLoS One	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductases (MTHFRs) play a key role in the biosynthesis of methionine in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this study, we report the identification of a novel T-DNA-tagged mutant WH672 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which was defective in vegetative growth, conidiation and pathogenicity. Analysis of the mutation confirmed a single T-DNA insertion upstream of MET13, which encodes a 626-amino-acid protein encoding a MTHFR. Targeted gene deletion of MET13 resulted in mutants that were non-pathogenic and significantly impaired in aerial growth and melanin pigmentation. All phenotypes associated with Δmet13 mutants could be overcome by addition of exogenous methionine. The M. oryzae genome contains a second predicted MTHFR-encoding gene, MET12. The deduced amino acid sequences of Met13 and Met12 share 32% identity. Interestingly, Δmet12 mutants produced significantly less conidia compared with the isogenic wild-type strain and grew very poorly in the absence of methionine, but were fully pathogenic. Deletion of both genes resulted in Δmet13Δmet12 mutants that showed similar phenotypes to single Δmet13 mutants. Taken together, we conclude that the MTHFR gene, MET13, is essential for infection-related morphogenesis by the rice blast fungus M. oryzae.
24147765	Rice DB: an Oryza Information Portal linking annotation, subcellular location, function, expression, regulation, and evolutionary information for rice and Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant J	Omics research in Oryza sativa (rice) relies on the use of multiple databases to obtain different types of information to define gene function. We present Rice DB, an Oryza information portal that is a functional genomics database, linking gene loci to comprehensive annotations, expression data and the subcellular location of encoded proteins. Rice DB has been designed to integrate the direct comparison of rice with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), based on orthology or 'expressology', thus using and combining available information from two pre-eminent plant models. To establish Rice DB, gene identifiers (more than 40 types) and annotations from a variety of sources were compiled, functional information based on large-scale and individual studies was manually collated, hundreds of microarrays were analysed to generate expression annotations, and the occurrences of potential functional regulatory motifs in promoter regions were calculated. A range of computational subcellular localization predictions were also run for all putative proteins encoded in the rice genome, and experimentally confirmed protein localizations have been collated, curated and linked to functional studies in rice. A single search box allows anything from gene identifiers (for rice and/or Arabidopsis), motif sequences, subcellular location, to keyword searches to be entered, with the capability of Boolean searches (such as AND/OR). To demonstrate the utility of Rice DB, several examples are presented including a rice mitochondrial proteome, which draws on a variety of sources for subcellular location data within Rice DB. Comparisons of subcellular location, functional annotations, as well as transcript expression in parallel with Arabidopsis reveals examples of conservation between rice and Arabidopsis, using Rice DB (http://ricedb.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au).
24113387	Prediction and characterization of protein-protein interaction network in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 A.	2013	Res Microbiol	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight disease in rice, is one of the most serious plant pathogens worldwide. In the current analysis, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network of Xoo strain PXO99(A) with two computational approaches (interolog method and domain combination method), and verified by K-Nearest Neighbors classification method. The predicted PPI network of Xoo PXO99(A) contains 36,886 interactions among 1988 proteins. KNN verification and GO annotation confirm the reliability of the network. Detailed analysis of flagellar synthesis and chemotaxis system shows that σ factors (especially σ(28), σ(54)) in Xoo PXO99(A) are very important for flagellar synthesis and motility, and transcription factors RpoA, RpoB and RpoC are hubs to connect most σ factors. Furthermore, Xoo PXO99(A) may have both cAMP and c-di-GMP signal transduction system, and the latter is especially important for this plant pathogen. This study therefore provides valuable clues to explore the pathogenicity and metabolic regulation of Xoo PXO99(A).
24099956	Method of phorbol ester degradation in Jatropha curcas L. seed cake using rice bran lipase.	2014	J Biosci Bioeng	A novel enzymatic degradation of phorbol esters (PE) in the jatropha seed cake was developed using lipase. Cihera rice bran lipase had the highest ability to hydrolyze PE, and reduced PE to a safe level after 8 h of incubation. Enzymatic degradation may be a promising method for PE degradation.
24201910	A newly designed degenerate PCR primer based on pmoA gene for detection of nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria from different ecological niches.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	A new pmoA gene-based PCR primer set was designed for detection of nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (n-damo) bacteria from four different ecosystems, namely rice paddy soil, freshwater reservoir, reed bed, and sludge from wastewater treatment plant. This primer set showed high specificity and efficiency in recovering n-damo bacteria from these diverse samples. The obtained sequences showed 88-94 and 90-96% similarity to nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively, with the known NC10 phylum bacterium. According to the UniFrac principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), DNA sequences retrieved by the new PCR primer set in this study formed a separate group from the reported sequences, indicating higher diversity of n-damo in the environment. This newly designed PCR primer is capable of amplifying not only the currently known n-damo bacteria but also those that have not been reported, providing new information on the ecological diversity and distribution of this group of microorganisms in the ecosystem.
24085308	RNAi-mediated suppression of endogenous storage proteins leads to a change in localization of overexpressed cholera toxin B-subunit and the allergen protein RAG2 in rice seeds.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: RNAi-mediated suppression of the endogenous storage proteins in MucoRice-CTB-RNAi seeds affects not only the levels of overexpressed CTB and RAG2 allergen, but also the localization of CTB and RAG2. A purification-free rice-based oral cholera vaccine (MucoRice-CTB) was previously developed by our laboratories using a cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) overexpression system. Recently, an advanced version of MucoRice-CTB was developed (MucoRice-CTB-RNAi) through the use of RNAi to suppress the production of the endogenous storage proteins 13-kDa prolamin and glutelin, so as to increase CTB expression. The level of the α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor-like protein RAG2 (a major rice allergen) was reduced in MucoRice-CTB-RNAi seeds in comparison with wild-type (WT) rice. To investigate whether RNAi-mediated suppression of storage proteins affects the localization of overexpressed CTB and major rice allergens, we generated an RNAi line without CTB (MucoRice-RNAi) and investigated gene expression, and protein production and localization of two storage proteins, CTB, and five major allergens in MucoRice-CTB, MucoRice-CTB-RNAi, MucoRice-RNAi, and WT rice. In all lines, glyoxalase I was detected in the cytoplasm, and 52- and 63-kDa globulin-like proteins were found in the aleurone particles. In WT, RAG2 and 19-kDa globulin were localized mainly in protein bodies II (PB-II) of the endosperm cells. Knockdown of glutelin A led to a partial destruction of PB-II and was accompanied by RAG2 relocation to the plasma membrane/cell wall and cytoplasm. In MucoRice-CTB, CTB was localized in the cytoplasm and PB-II. In MucoRice-CTB-RNAi, CTB was produced at a level six times that in MucoRice-CTB and was localized, similar to RAG2, in the plasma membrane/cell wall and cytoplasm. Our findings indicate that the relocation of CTB in MucoRice-CTB-RNAi may contribute to down-regulation of RAG2.
24130868	Genes and co-expression modules common to drought and bacterial stress responses in Arabidopsis and rice.	2013	PLoS One	Plants are simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses resulting in enormous changes in the molecular landscape within the cell. Identification and characterization of the synergistic and antagonistic components of stress response mechanisms contributing to the cross talk between stresses is of high priority to explore and enhance multiple stress responses. To this end, we performed meta-analysis of drought (abiotic), bacterial (biotic) stress response in rice and Arabidopsis by analyzing a total of 386 microarray samples belonging to 20 microarray studies and identified approximately 3100 and 900 DEGs in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. About 38.5% (1214) and 28.7% (272) DEGs were common to drought and bacterial stresses in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. A majority of these common DEGs showed conserved expression status in both stresses. Gene ontology enrichment analysis clearly demarcated the response and regulation of various plant hormones and related biological processes. Fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of alkaloids were upregulated and, nitrogen metabolism and photosynthesis was downregulated in both stress conditions. WRKY transcription family genes were highly enriched in all upregulated gene sets while 'CO-like' TF family showed inverse relationship of expression between drought and bacterial stresses. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis divided DEG sets into multiple modules that show high co-expression and identified stress specific hub genes with high connectivity. Detection of consensus modules based on DEGs common to drought and bacterial stress revealed 9 and 4 modules in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, with conserved and reversed co-expression patterns.
24101203	Expression and purification of recombinant human serum albumin from selectively terminable transgenic rice.	2013	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	Human serum albumin (HSA) is widely utilized for medical purposes and biochemical research. Transgenic rice has proved to be an attractive bioreactor for mass production of recombinant HSA (rHSA). However, transgene spread is a major environmental and food safety concern for transgenic rice expressing proteins of medical value. This study aimed to develop a selectively terminable transgenic rice line expressing HSA in rice seeds, and a simple process for recovery and purification of rHSA for economical manufacture. An HSA expression cassette was inserted into a T-DNA vector encoding an RNA interference (RNAi) cassette suppressing the CYP81A6 gene. This gene detoxifies the herbicide bentazon and is linked to the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) cassette which confers glyphosate tolerance. ANX Sepharose Fast Flow (ANX FF) anion exchange chromatography coupled with Butyl Sepharose High Performance (Butyl HP) hydrophobic interaction chromatography was used to purify rHSA. A transgenic rice line, HSA-84, was obtained with stable expression of rHSA of up to 0.72% of the total dry weight of the dehusked rice seeds. This line also demonstrated high sensitivity to bentazon, and thus could be killed selectively by a spray of bentazon. A two-step chromatography purification scheme was established to purify the rHSA from rice seeds to a purity of 99% with a recovery of 62.4%. Results from mass spectrometry and N-terminus sequencing suggested that the purified rHSA was identical to natural plasma-derived HSA. This study provides an alternative strategy for large-scale production of HSA with a built-in transgene safety control mechanism.
24092451	Endoglucanase and total cellulase from newly isolated Rhizopus oryzae and Trichoderma reesei: production, characterization, and thermal stability.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	A multienzymatic complex production was evaluated, as well as endoglucanase and total cellulase characterization, during solid-state fermentation of rice industry wastes with Rhizopus oryzae CCT 7560 (newly isolated microorganism) and Trichoderma reesei QM 9414 (control). R. oryzae produced enzymes with higher activity at 15 h of fermentation (5.1 and 2.3 U g(-1) to endoglucanase and total cellulase), while T. reesei produced them at 55 h (15.3 and 2.8 U g(-1) to endoglucanase and total cellulase). The optimum temperature for total cellulase and endoglucanase was 60 °C. For Trichoderma and Rhizopus, the optimum pH was 5.0 and 6.0 for total cellulase and 6.0 and 5.0 for endoglucanase, respectively. The enzymes produced by Rhizopus presented higher stability at the temperature range evaluated (25-100 °C); the endoglucanase KM value was 20 times lower than the one found for Trichoderma. The characterization of the cellulolytic enzymes from the fungal species native of rice husk revealed that they can be more efficient than the genetically modified enzymes when rice husk and rice bran are used as substrates.
24096420	Two histone deacetylases, FfHda1 and FfHda2, are important for Fusarium fujikuroi secondary metabolism and virulence.	2013	Appl Environ Microbiol	Histone modifications are crucial for the regulation of secondary metabolism in various filamentous fungi. Here we studied the involvement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in secondary metabolism in the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, a known producer of several secondary metabolites, including phytohormones, pigments, and mycotoxins. Deletion of three Zn(2+)-dependent HDAC-encoding genes, ffhda1, ffhda2, and ffhda4, indicated that FfHda1 and FfHda2 regulate secondary metabolism, whereas FfHda4 is involved in developmental processes but is dispensable for secondary-metabolite production in F. fujikuroi. Single deletions of ffhda1 and ffhda2 resulted not only in an increase or decrease but also in derepression of metabolite biosynthesis under normally repressing conditions. Moreover, double deletion of both the ffhda1 and ffhda2 genes showed additive but also distinct phenotypes with regard to secondary-metabolite biosynthesis, and both genes are required for gibberellic acid (GA)-induced bakanae disease on the preferred host plant rice, as Δffhda1 Δffhda2 mutants resemble the uninfected control plant. Microarray analysis with a Δffhda1 mutant that has lost the major HDAC revealed differential expression of secondary-metabolite gene clusters, which was subsequently verified by a combination of chemical and biological approaches. These results indicate that HDACs are involved not only in gene silencing but also in the activation of some genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with the Δffhda1 mutant revealed significant alterations in the acetylation state of secondary-metabolite gene clusters compared to the wild type, thereby providing insights into the regulatory mechanism at the chromatin level. Altogether, manipulation of HDAC-encoding genes constitutes a powerful tool to control secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi.
24268165	The knockdown of chloroplastic ascorbate peroxidases reveals its regulatory role in the photosynthesis and protection under photo-oxidative stress in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	The inactivation of the chloroplast ascorbate peroxidases (chlAPXs) has been thought to limit the efficiency of the water-water cycle and photo-oxidative protection under stress conditions. In this study, we have generated double knockdown rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants in both OsAPX7 (sAPX) and OsAPX8 (tAPX) genes, which encode chloroplastic APXs (chlAPXs). By employing an integrated approach involving gene expression, proteomics, biochemical and physiological analyses of photosynthesis, we have assessed the role of chlAPXs in the regulation of the protection of the photosystem II (PSII) activity and CO2 assimilation in rice plants exposed to high light (HL) and methyl violagen (MV). The chlAPX knockdown plants were affected more severely than the non-transformed (NT) plants in the activity and structure of PSII and CO2 assimilation in the presence of MV. Although MV induced significant increases in pigment content in the knockdown plants, the increases were apparently not sufficient for protection. Treatment with HL also caused generalized damage in PSII in both types of plants. The knockdown and NT plants exhibited differences in photosynthetic parameters related to efficiency of utilization of light and CO2. The knockdown plants overexpressed other antioxidant enzymes in response to the stresses and increased the GPX activity in the chloroplast-enriched fraction. Our data suggest that a partial deficiency of chlAPX expression modulate the PSII activity and integrity, reflecting the overall photosynthesis when rice plants are subjected to acute oxidative stress. However, under normal growth conditions, the knockdown plants exhibit normal phenotype, biochemical and physiological performance.
24092004	Community structure and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria after conversion from soybean to rice paddy in albic soils of Northeast China.	2014	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Community composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the albic soil grown with soybean and rice for different years was investigated by construction of clone libraries, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) by PCR amplification of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene. Soil samples were collected at two layers (0-5 and 20-25 cm) from a soybean field and four rice paddy fields with 1, 5, 9, and 17 years of continuous rice cultivation. Both the community structures and abundances of AOA and AOB showed detectable changes after conversion from soybean to rice paddy judged by clone library, DGGE, and q-PCR analyses. In general, the archaeal amoA gene abundance increased after conversion to rice cultivation, while bacterial amoA gene abundance decreased. The abundances of both AOA and AOB were higher in the surface layer than the bottom one in the soybean field, but a reverse trend was observed for AOB in all paddy samples regardless of the duration of paddy cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis identified nine subclusters of AOA and seven subclusters of AOB. Community composition of both AOA and AOB was correlated with available ammonium and increased pH value caused by flooding in multiple variance analysis. Community shift of AOB was also observed in different paddy fields, but the two layers did not show any detectable changes in DGGE analysis. Conversion from soybean to rice cultivation changed the community structure and abundance of AOA and AOB in albic agricultural soil, which requires that necessary cultivation practice be followed to manage the N utilization more effectively.
24085578	THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	Proper branching and successful reproductive growth is of great importance for rice productivity. Substantial progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying tillering control and spikelet sterility. However, rice tillering is developmentally controlled, and how it is regulated coordinately with reproductive growth remains unclear. This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1). Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation. In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages. The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening. Histological analyses showed that the mutation in this1 resulted in anisotropic cell expansion and cell division. Using a map-based cloning approach, This1 was found to encode a class III lipase. Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control. The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin. Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development.
24142159	Pseudomonas oryzae sp. nov. isolated from a paddy soil in South China.	2013	Arch Microbiol	A Gram-staining-negative, rod-shaped and motile with several polar flagellums bacterium, designated WM-3(T), was isolated from a rice paddy soil in South China. Growth occurred with 0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.0 %), at pH 5.5-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 25-42 °C (optimum 30-37 °C) in liquid Reasoner's 2A medium. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and gyrB gene sequences revealed that strain WM-3(T) was most closely related to the type strains of the species Pseudomonas linyingensis and Pseudomonas sagittaria. Its sequence similarities with P. linyingensis CGMCC 1.10701(T) and P. sagittaria JCM 18195(T) were 97.4 and 97.3 %, respectively, for 16S rRNA gene, and were 94.1 and 94.2 %, respectively, for gyrB gene. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain WM-3(T) and these two type strains showed relatedness of 35.6 and 30.9 %, respectively. G+C content of genomic DNA was 69.4 mol%. The whole-cell fatty acids mainly consisted of C16:0 (30.0 %), C16:1 ω6c and/or C16:1 ω7c (19.3 %) and C18:1 ω6c and/or C18:1 ω7c (16.3 %). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain WM-3(T) belongs to genus Pseudomonas but represents a novel species, for which the name Pseudomonas oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-3(T) (=KCTC 32247(T) =CGMCC 1.12417(T)).
24088728	Characterization of GM events by insert knowledge adapted re-sequencing approaches.	2013	Sci Rep	Detection methods and data from molecular characterization of genetically modified (GM) events are needed by stakeholders of public risk assessors and regulators. Generally, the molecular characteristics of GM events are incomprehensively revealed by current approaches and biased towards detecting transformation vector derived sequences. GM events are classified based on available knowledge of the sequences of vectors and inserts (insert knowledge). Herein we present three insert knowledge-adapted approaches for characterization GM events (TT51-1 and T1c-19 rice as examples) based on paired-end re-sequencing with the advantages of comprehensiveness, accuracy, and automation. The comprehensive molecular characteristics of two rice events were revealed with additional unintended insertions comparing with the results from PCR and Southern blotting. Comprehensive transgene characterization of TT51-1 and T1c-19 is shown to be independent of a priori knowledge of the insert and vector sequences employing the developed approaches. This provides an opportunity to identify and characterize also unknown GM events.
24225178	Genome-wide analysis and evolutionary study of sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) gene family members in Arabidopsis and Oryza.	2014	Comput Biol Chem	The over-expression of plant specific SnRK2 gene family members by hyperosmotic stress and some by abscisic acid is well established. In this report, we have analyzed the evolution of SnRK2 gene family in different plant lineages including green algae, moss, lycophyte, dicot and monocot. Our results provide some evidences to indicate that the natural selection pressure had considerable influence on cis-regulatory promoter region and coding region of SnRK2 members in Arabidopsis and Oryza independently through time. Observed degree of sequence/motif conservation amongst SnRK2 homolog in all the analyzed plant lineages strongly supported their inclusion as members of this family. The chromosomal distributions of duplicated SnRK2 members have also been analyzed in Arabidopsis and Oryza. Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) database derived expression data and the presence of abiotic stress related promoter elements within the 1 kb upstream promoter region of these SnRK2 family members further strengthen the observations of previous workers. Additionally, the phylogenetic relationships of SnRK2 have been studied in all plant lineages along with their respective exon-intron structural patterns. Our results indicate that the ancestral SnRK2 gene of land plants gradually evolved by duplication and diversification and modified itself through exon-intron loss events to survive under environmental stress conditions.
24122707	Dynamic changes in the composite microbial system MC1 during and following its rapid degradation of lignocellulose.	2014	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	To monitor the dynamics of the composite microbial system MC1 during its degradation of lignocellulose and to improve our understanding of the microbial communities involved in this biomass conversion, MC1 was characterized at eight time points over an 18-day, thermophilic, aerobic, static cultivation. We found the microbial communities to be dynamic, rhythmic consortia capable of changing in response to lignocellulose degradation. The growth curve over 18 days was M-shaped. Based on the quantitative changes in five major components of MC1 (Clostridium straminisolvens CSK-1, Clostridium sp. FG4, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. M1-5, and Bordetella sp. M1-6), reduction in rice straw weight, cellulase (CMCase) activity, xylanase activity, and changes in medium pH, we found that the process comprised two identifiable phases. Rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, while the post-rapid degradation phase included days 10 to 18. Day 3 and day 12 were two key time points in the rapid degradation phase and post-rapid degradation phase, respectively. Two anaerobes, C. straminisolvens CSK-1 and Clostridium sp. FG4, dominated the MC1 system from day 0 to day 18.
24170341	Gene SGL, encoding a kinesin-like protein with transactivation activity, is involved in grain length and plant height in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Grain shape, a complex agronomic trait, plays an important role in determining yield and quality in rice. In the present study, a mutant named short grain length (sgl) was identified among explants of tissue cultured japonica variety Kita-ake. It exhibited reduced plant height (about 72 % of WT) and short grain length (about 80 % of WT). The reduced length was due to decreased cell elongation. The Short Grain Length (SGL) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a kinesin-like protein. SGL was expressed in the whole plant, especially in the stem and panicles. SGL was shown to have transcriptional activity. In onion epidermal cells, SGL protein was found mainly in the nucleus. Real-time PCR analyses showed that expression levels of genes involved in gibberellin metabolic pathways were affected in the sgl mutant. These data suggested that SGL protein may be involved in regulating GA synthesis and response genes, that in turn, regulates grain length and plant height.
24075758	Wild rice (Zizania palustris L.) prevents atherogenesis in LDL receptor knockout mice.	2013	Atherosclerosis	OBJECTIVES: Dietary modifications including healthy eating constitute one of the first line strategies for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors including high cholesterol and atherosclerosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential cardiovascular benefits of wild rice in male and female LDL-receptor-deficient (LDLr-KO) mice.

METHODS: Wild rice was used to create a semi-synthetic diet containing approximately 60% of total energy from carbohydrate. Two other experimental diets were similar in macronutrient composition, but containing either white rice or commercial carbohydrate sources. All diets were supplemented with 0.06% (w/w) dietary cholesterol. The mice were divided into six experimental groups and fed with these diets over 24 weeks.

RESULTS: Consumption of wild rice significantly reduced the size and severity of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic roots of male and female mice by 71 and 61% respectively, compared to the control group of the same gender. This effect was associated with significant reductions of plasma cholesterol levels by 15 and 40%, low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels by 12 and 42%, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels by 35 and 75% respectively, in male and female mice compared to the control group of the same gender. Increased fecal cholesterol excretion of up to 34% was also noted, compared to the control group of the same gender. However, the antiatherogenic effect of wild rice was not associated with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities.

CONCLUSION: Current data suggest that cholesterol-lowering effects of wild rice may be the main factor for the prevention of atherogenesis in LDLr-KO mice. Additional studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action.
24154623	A major QTL controlling deep rooting on rice chromosome 4.	2013	Sci Rep	Drought is the most serious abiotic stress that hinders rice production under rainfed conditions. Breeding for deep rooting is a promising strategy to improve the root system architecture in shallow-rooting rice cultivars to avoid drought stress. We analysed the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the ratio of deep rooting (RDR) in three F₂ mapping populations derived from crosses between each of three shallow-rooting varieties ('ARC5955', 'Pinulupot1', and 'Tupa729') and a deep-rooting variety, 'Kinandang Patong'. In total, we detected five RDR QTLs on chromosomes 2, 4, and 6. In all three populations, QTLs on chromosome 4 were found to be located at similar positions; they explained from 32.0% to 56.6% of the total RDR phenotypic variance. This suggests that one or more key genetic factors controlling the root growth angle in rice is located in this region of chromosome 4.
24083427	Effect of phosphorus levels on the protein profiles of secreted protein and root surface protein of rice.	2013	J Proteome Res	Plant roots are complicated organs that absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Roots also play an essential role in protecting plants from attack by soil pathogens and develop a beneficial role with some soil microorganisms. Plant-derived rhizosphere proteins (e.g., root secretory proteins and root surface binding proteins) are considered to play important roles in developing mutual relationships in the rhizosphere. In the rhizosphere, where plant roots meet the surrounding environment, it has been suggested that root secretory protein and root surface binding protein are important factors. Furthermore, it is not known how the physiological status of the plant affects the profile of these proteins. In this study, rice plants were grown aseptically, with or without phosphorus nutrition, and proteins were obtained from root bathing solution (designated as root secretory proteins) and obtained using 0.2 M CaCl2 solution (designated as root surface binding proteins). The total number of identified proteins in the root bathing solution was 458, and the number of root surface binding proteins was 256. More than half of the proteins were observed in both fractions. Most of the proteins were categorized as either having signal peptides or no membrane transport helix sites. The functional categorization suggested that most of the proteins seemed to have secretory pathways and were involved in defense/disease-related functions. These characteristics seem to be unique to rhizosphere proteins, and the latter might be part of the plants strategy to defeat pathogens in the soil. The low phosphorus treatment significantly increased the number of pathogenesis-related proteins in the root secretory proteins, whereas the change was small in the case of the root surface binding proteins. The results suggested that the roots are actively and selectively secreting protein into the rhizosphere.
24185036	Ionic liquid pretreatment to enhance the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass.	2013	Bioresour Technol	Four lignocellulosic biomasses, water hyacinth, rice straw, mango leaves and spruce were pretreated by ionic liquid (IL) to enhance anaerobic digestion. The effect of pretreatment conditions, such as alkyl chain length of IL, temperature, time and operation cycle on lignocellulosic composition, structure and biogas production was evaluated. The enhancement of biogas production by [C4mim]Cl pretreatment at 120°C for 2 h decreases in the order of water hyacinth>spruce>rice straw>mango leaves. Higher methane production of regenerated rice straw and mango leaves could reach 233 and 125 mL/g carbohydrates under 140°C or 2 h and 140°C for 8, respectively. Furthermore, the technology of aqueous biphasic systems was developed to recovery IL, and the recovery rate of ILs was in the range of 54.3-94.6%.
24187491	Bone mass density estimation: Archimede's principle versus automatic X-ray histogram and edge detection technique in ovariectomized rats treated with germinated brown rice bioactives.	2013	Clin Interv Aging	BACKGROUND: Bone mass density is an important parameter used in the estimation of the severity and depth of lesions in osteoporosis. Estimation of bone density using existing methods in experimental models has its advantages as well as drawbacks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the X-ray histogram edge detection technique was used to estimate the bone mass density in ovariectomized rats treated orally with germinated brown rice (GBR) bioactives, and the results were compared with estimated results obtained using Archimede's principle. New bone cell proliferation was assessed by histology and immunohistochemical reaction using polyclonal nuclear antigen. Additionally, serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium and zinc concentrations were detected using a chemistry analyzer and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Rats were divided into groups of six as follows: sham (nonovariectomized, nontreated); ovariectomized, nontreated; and ovariectomized and treated with estrogen, or Remifemin®, GBR-phenolics, acylated steryl glucosides, gamma oryzanol, and gamma amino-butyric acid extracted from GBR at different doses.

RESULTS: Our results indicate a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium, and zinc and ash content in the treated groups compared with the ovariectomized nontreated group (P < 0.05). Bone density increased significantly (P < 0.05) in groups treated with estrogen, GBR, Remifemin®, and gamma oryzanol compared to the ovariectomized nontreated group. Histological sections revealed more osteoblasts in the treated groups when compared with the untreated groups. A polyclonal nuclear antigen reaction showing proliferating new cells was observed in groups treated with estrogen, Remifemin®, GBR, acylated steryl glucosides, and gamma oryzanol. There was a good correlation between bone mass densities estimated using Archimede's principle and the edge detection technique between the treated groups (r (2) = 0.737, P = 0.004).

CONCLUSION: Our study shows that GBR bioactives increase bone density, which might be via the activation of zinc formation and increased calcium content, and that X-ray edge detection technique is effective in the measurement of bone density and can be employed effectively in this respect.
24123409	Imaging neurodegeneration in the mouse hippocampus after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia using oscillating gradient diffusion MRI.	2014	Magn Reson Med	PURPOSE: To investigate if frequency-dependent contrasts using oscillating gradient diffusion MRI (dMRI) can detect hypoxia-ischemia (HI) -induced neurodegeneration in the neonatal mouse hippocampus.

METHODS: Pulsed- and oscillating-gradient dMR images (at 50, 100, and 150 Hz) were acquired from postmortem fixed brains of mice exposed to neonatal HI using the Rice-Vanucci model. MRI data were acquired at 1, 4, and 8 days following HI, and compared with histological data from the same mice for in situ histological validation of the MRI findings.

RESULTS: The rate of change of apparent diffusion coefficient with gradient frequency (Δf ADC) revealed unique layer-specific contrasts in the neonatal mouse hippocampus. Δf ADC measurements were found to show a significant decrease in response to neonatal HI injury, in the pyramidal (Py) and granule (GrDG) cell layers compared with contralateral regions. The areas of reduced intensity in the Δf ADC maps corresponded to regional neurodegeneration seen with H&E and Fluoro-Jade C stainings, indicating that alterations in Δf ADC contrasts are sensitive to early microstructural changes due to HI-induced neurodegeneration in the studied regions.

CONCLUSION: The findings show that the frequency-dependence of ADC measurements with oscillating-gradient dMRI can provide a sensitive contrast to detect HI-induced neurodegeneration in neuronal layers of the neonatal mouse hippocampus.
24101772	Stress-induced cytokinin synthesis increases drought tolerance through the coordinated regulation of carbon and nitrogen assimilation in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	The effects of water deficit on carbon and nitrogen metabolism were investigated in flag leaves of wild-type and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa japonica 'Kitaake') plants expressing ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE (IPT; encoding the enzyme that mediates the rate-limiting step in cytokinin synthesis) under the control of P(SARK), a maturation- and stress-induced promoter. While the wild-type plants displayed inhibition of photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation during water stress, neither carbon nor nitrogen assimilation was affected by stress in the transgenic P(SARK)::IPT plants. In the transgenic plants, photosynthesis was maintained at control levels during stress and the flag leaf showed increased sucrose (Suc) phosphate synthase activity and reduced Suc synthase and invertase activities, leading to increased Suc contents. The sustained carbon assimilation in the transgenic P(SARK)::IPT plants was well correlated with enhanced nitrate content, higher nitrate reductase activity, and sustained ammonium contents, indicating that the stress-induced cytokinin synthesis in the transgenic plants played a role in maintaining nitrate acquisition. Protein contents decreased and free amino acids increased in wild-type plants during stress, while protein content was preserved in the transgenic plants. Our results indicate that the stress-induced cytokinin synthesis in the transgenic plants promoted sink strengthening through a cytokinin-dependent coordinated regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism that facilitates an enhanced tolerance of the transgenic plants to water deficit.
24288473	Application of potential phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and organic acids on phosphate solubilization from phosphate rock in aerobic rice.	2013	ScientificWorldJournal	A study was conducted at Universiti Putra Malaysia to determine the effect of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and organic acids (oxalic & malic) on phosphate (P) solubilization from phosphate rock (PR) and growth of aerobic rice. Four rates of each organic acid (0, 10, 20, and 30 mM), and PSB strain (Bacillus sp.) were applied to aerobic rice. Total bacterial populations, amount of P solubilization, P uptake, soil pH, and root morphology were determined. The results of the study showed significantly high P solubilization in PSB with organic acid treatments. Among the two organic acids, oxalic acid was found more effective compared to malic acid. Application of oxalic acid at 20 mM along with PSB16 significantly increased soluble soil P (28.39 mg kg(-1)), plant P uptake (0.78 P pot(-1)), and plant biomass (33.26 mg). Addition of organic acids with PSB and PR had no influence on soil pH during the planting period. A higher bacterial population was found in rhizosphere (8.78 log10 cfu g(-1)) compared to the nonrhizosphere and endosphere regions. The application of organic acids along with PSB enhanced soluble P in the soil solution, improved root growth, and increased plant biomass of aerobic rice seedlings without affecting soil pH.
24136625	Single and fused transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis rice alter the species-specific responses of non-target planthoppers to elevated carbon dioxide and temperature.	2014	Pest Manag Sci	BACKGROUND: The approval of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice by China was momentous for biotech crops, although it has yet to be approved for commercial production. Non-target pest problems in rice paddies, such as the three ecologically similar species of planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens, Laodelphax striatellus and Sogatella furcifera, could become increasingly serious under global climate change. Fused (Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac) and single (Cry1Ab) transgenic Bt rice were evaluated for effects on species-specific responses of planthoppers to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature.

RESULTS: Transgenic Bt rice lines significantly modified species-specific responses of the planthoppers to elevated CO2 and temperature. High temperature appears to favour outbreaks of S. furcifera relative to N. lugens and L. striatellus when feeding upon fused transgenic Bt rice, especially at elevated CO2 . Elevated CO2 at high temperature appears to be a factor reducing S. furcifera occurrence when feeding upon single transgenic Bt rice.

CONCLUSION: Different types of transgenic Bt rice alter the species-specific responses of non-target planthoppers to elevated CO2 and temperature. Compared with their non-transgenic parental lines, the single transgenic Bt rice shows better performance in controlling the non-target planthopper S. furcifera by comparison with the fused transgenic Bt rice under elevated CO2 and temperature. It is suggested that multitypes of transgenic Bt rice be used in the field simultaneously in order to take advantage of high transgenic diversity for optimal performance against all pests in paddy fields.
24158250	Characterization and genetic mapping of a Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 locus in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Theor Appl Genet	Plant height is an important agronomic trait for crop architecture and yield. Most known factors determining plant height function in gibberellin or brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signal transduction. Here, we report a japonica rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) dominant dwarf mutant, Photoperiod-sensitive dwarf 1 (Psd1). The Psd1 mutant showed impaired cell division and elongation, and a severe dwarf phenotype under long-day conditions, but nearly normal growth in short-day. The plant height of Psd1 mutant could not be rescued by gibberellin or brassinosteroid treatment. Genetic analysis with R1 and F2 populations determined that Psd1 phenotype was controlled by a single dominant locus. Linkage analysis with 101 tall F2 plants grown in a long-day season, which were derived from a cross between Psd1 and an indica cultivar, located Psd1 locus on chromosome 1. Further fine-mapping with 1017 tall F2 plants determined this locus on an 11.5-kb region. Sequencing analysis of this region detected a mutation site in a gene encoding a putative lipid transfer protein; the mutation produces a truncated C-terminus of the protein. This study establishes the genetic foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating plant cell division and elongation mediated by interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
24083549	Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of fecundity in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).	2013	J Proteome Res	As an r-strategy insect species, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) is a serious pest of rice crops in the temperate and tropical regions of Asia and Australia, which may be due to its robust fecundity. Here we combined 2-DE comparative proteomic and RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to identify fecundity-related proteins and genes. Using high- and low-fecundity populations as sample groups, a total of 54 and 75 proteins were significantly altered in the third and sixth day brachypterous female stages, respectively, and 39 and 54 of these proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In addition, 71,966 unigenes were quantified by Illumina sequencing. On the basis of the transcriptomic analysis, 7408 and 1639 unigenes demonstrated higher expression levels in the high-fecundity population in the second day brachypterous female adults and the second day fifth instar nymphs, respectively, and 411 unigenes were up-regulated in both groups. Of these dozens of proteins and thousands of unigenes, five were differentially expressed at both the protein and mRNA levels at all four time points, suggesting that these genes may regulate fecundity. Glutamine synthetase (GS) was chosen for further functional studies. RNAi knockdown of the GS gene reduced the fecundity of N. lugens by 64.6%, disrupted ovary development, and inhibited vitellogenin (Vg) expression. Our results show that a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided five candidate proteins and genes for further study. The knowledge gained from this study may lead to a more fundamental understanding of the fecundity of this important agricultural insect pest.
24145853	A putative candidate for the recessive gall midge resistance gene gm3 in rice identified and validated.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We report here tagging and fine-mapping of gm3 gene, development of a functional marker for it and its use in marker-assisted selection. The recessive rice gall midge resistance gene, gm3 identified in the rice breeding line RP2068-18-3-5 confers resistance against five of the seven Indian biotypes of the Asian rice gall midge Orseolia oryzae. We report here tagging and fine-mapping of gm3 gene, development of a functional marker for it and demonstrated its use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). A mapping population consisting of 302 F10 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross TN1 (susceptible)/RP2068-18-3-5, was screened against gall midge biotype 4 (GMB4) and analyzed with a set of 89 polymorphic SSR markers distributed uniformly across the rice genome. Two SSR markers, RM17480 and gm3SSR4, located on chromosome 4L displayed high degree of co-segregation with the trait phenotype and flanked the gene. In silico analysis of the genomic region spanning these two markers contained 62 putatively expressed genes, including a gene encoding an NB-ARC (NBS-LRR) domain containing protein. A fragment of this gene was amplified with the designed marker, NBcloning 0.9 Kb from the two susceptible TN1, Improved Samba Mahsuri (B95-1) and two resistant cultivars, RP 2068-18-3-5 and Phalguna (with Gm2 gene). The amplicons were observed to be polymorphic between the susceptible and resistant genotypes and hence were cloned and sequenced. A new primer, gm3del3, which was designed based on sequence polymorphism, amplified fragments with distinct size polymorphism among RP2068-18-3-5, Phalguna and TN1 and B95-1 and displayed no recombination in the entire mapping population. Expression of the candidate NB-ARC gene in the susceptible TN1 and the resistant RP2068-18-3-5 plants following infestation with GMB4 was analyzed, through real-time reverse transcription PCR. Results showed twofold enhanced expression in RP2068-18-3-5 plants, but not in TN1 plants, 120 h after infestation. Amino acid sequence and structure analysis of the proteins coded by different alleles of gm3 gene showed deletion of eight amino acids due to an early stop codon in RP2068-18-3-5 resulting in a change in the functional domain of the protein. The gm3del3 was used as a functional marker for introgression of gm3 gene into the genetic background of the elite bacterial blight resistant cultivar Improved Samba Mahsuri (B95-1) through MAS.
24098512	Transcriptomics of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in response to the bacterial antagonist Lysobacter enzymogenes reveals candidate fungal defense response genes.	2013	PLoS One	Plants and animals have evolved a first line of defense response to pathogens called innate or basal immunity. While basal defenses in these organisms are well studied, there is almost a complete lack of understanding of such systems in fungal species, and more specifically, how they are able to detect and mount a defense response upon pathogen attack. Hence, the goal of the present study was to understand how fungi respond to biotic stress by assessing the transcriptional profile of the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, when challenged with the bacterial antagonist Lysobacter enzymogenes. Based on microscopic observations of interactions between M. oryzae and wild-type L. enzymogenes strain C3, we selected early and intermediate stages represented by time-points of 3 and 9 hours post-inoculation, respectively, to evaluate the fungal transcriptome using RNA-seq. For comparative purposes, we also challenged the fungus with L. enzymogenes mutant strain DCA, previously demonstrated to be devoid of antifungal activity. A comparison of transcriptional data from fungal interactions with the wild-type bacterial strain C3 and the mutant strain DCA revealed 463 fungal genes that were down-regulated during attack by C3; of these genes, 100 were also found to be up-regulated during the interaction with DCA. Functional categorization of genes in this suite included those with roles in carbohydrate metabolism, cellular transport and stress response. One gene in this suite belongs to the CFEM-domain class of fungal proteins. Another CFEM class protein called PTH11 has been previously characterized, and we found that a deletion in this gene caused advanced lesion development by C3 compared to its growth on the wild-type fungus. We discuss the characterization of this suite of 100 genes with respect to their role in the fungal defense response.
24014575	Phytochrome C is a key factor controlling long-day flowering in barley.	2013	Plant Physiol	The spring-type near isogenic line (NIL) of the winter-type barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) var. Hayakiso 2 (HK2) was developed by introducing VERNALIZATION-H1 (Vrn-H1) for spring growth habit from the spring-type var. Indo Omugi. Contrary to expectations, the spring-type NIL flowered later than winter-type HK2. This phenotypic difference was controlled by a single gene, which cosegregated only with phytochrome C (HvPhyC) among three candidates around the Vrn-H1 region (Vrn-H1, HvPhyC, and CASEIN KINASE IIα), indicating that HvPhyC was the most likely candidate gene. Compared with the late-flowering allele HvPhyC-l from the NIL, the early-flowering allele HvPhyC-e from HK2 had a single nucleotide polymorphism T1139C in exon 1, which caused a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution of phenylalanine at position 380 by serine in the functionally essential GAF (3', 5'-cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, formate hydrogen lyase activator protein) domain. Functional assay using a rice (Oryza sativa) phyA phyC double mutant line showed that both of the HvPhyC alleles are functional, but HvPhyC-e may have a hyperfunction. Expression analysis using NILs carrying HvPhyC-e and HvPhyC-l (NIL [HvPhyC-e] and NIL [HvPhyC-l], respectively) showed that HvPhyC-e up-regulated only the flowering promoter FLOWERING LOCUS T1 by bypassing the circadian clock genes and flowering integrator CONSTANS1 under a long photoperiod. Consistent with the up-regulation, NIL (HvPhyC-e) flowered earlier than NIL (HvPhyC-l) under long photoperiods. These results implied that HvPhyC is a key factor to control long-day flowering directly.
24162153	Major QTLs reduce the deleterious effects of high temperature on rice amylose content by increasing splicing efficiency of Wx pre-mRNA.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We discovered four QTLs that maintain proper rice amylose content at high temperature by increasing the splicing efficiency of Wx gene. Amylose content mainly controlled by Wx gene is a key physicochemical property for eating and cooking quality in rice. During the grain filling stage, high temperature can harm rice grain quality by significantly reducing the amylose content in many rice varieties. Here, we provide genetic evidences between Wx gene expression and rice amylose content at high temperature, and identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in this pathway. We performed a genome-wide survey on a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) which carried chromosomal segments from the heat resistant indica 9311 in the heat-sensitive japonica Nipponbare background. Four QTLs, qHAC4, qHAC8a, qHAC8b and qHAC10, which can reduce the deleterious effects of amylose content at high temperature, were identified and mapped to chromosome 4, 8, 8 and 10, respectively. The major QTL qHAC8a, with the highest LOD score of 6.196, was physically mapped to a small chromosome segment (~300 kb). The CSSLs carrying the qHAC8a, qHAC8b and/or qHAC4 from 9311 have the high pre-mRNA splicing efficiency of Wx gene and likely lead to stable amylose content at high temperature. Thus, increasing pre-mRNA processing efficiency of Wx gene could be an important regulation mechanism for maintaining stable amylose content in rice seeds at high temperature. In addition, our results provide a theoretical basis for breeding heat-stable grain in rice.
24164326	Transcriptome profiling in response to different types of ionizing radiation and identification of multiple radio marker genes in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	Ionizing radiation (IR) affects gene expression from plant genomes. To monitor the genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by three types of IR, we used the rice Affymetrix GeneChip microarray to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated by gamma rays (GAs), cosmic rays (CRs) and ion beams (IBs). The overall expression patterns in rice seedlings generated from seeds exposed to GAs and IBs were similar but differed for CRs exposure. Expression profiles of genes involved in metabolic pathways and cellular response were identified using MapMan analysis. This result revealed that IRs induced gene expression related to sucrose-starch metabolisms; sugar and starch accumulation was significantly increased in response to three types of IR in rice. In addition, we compared the genes commonly up- or down-regulated by exposure to three types of IR and identified 53 candidate radio marker genes (RMGs) that were differentially regulated by radiation exposure but not by other stresses. Among these genes, we selected six RMGs commonly applicable to different types of IR by specific coexpression networks using the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks (aracne) and confirmed the expression of these genes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Our results provided insight into the mechanisms of the responses to different types of IR and identified multiple marker genes to predict sensitivity to three types of IR.
24114051	Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of low amylose gene du12(t) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: We obtained interesting results for genetic analysis and molecular mapping of the du12(t) gene. Control of the amylose content in rice is the major strategy for breeding rice with improved quality. In this study, we conducted genetic analysis and molecular mapping to identify the dull gene in the dull rice, Milyang262. A single recessive gene, tentatively designated as du12(t), was identified as the dull gene that leads to the low amylose character of Milyang262. To investigate the inheritance of du12(t), genetic analysis on an F2 population derived from a cross between the gene carrier, Milyang262, and a moderate amylose content variety, Junam, was conducted. A segregation ratio of 3:1 (χ (2) = 1.71, p = 0.19) was observed, suggesting that du12(t) is a single recessive factor that controls the dull character in Milyang262. Allelism tests confirmed that du12(t) is not allelic to other low amylose controlling genes, wx or du1. Recessive class analysis was performed to localize the du12(t) locus. Mapping of du12(t) was conducted on F2 and F3 populations of Baegokchal/Milyang262 cross. Linkage analysis of 120 F2 plants revealed that RM6926 and RM3509 flank du12(t) at a 2.38-Mb region. To refine the du12(t) locus position, 986 F2 and 289 F3 additional normal plants were screened by the flanking markers. Twenty-six recombinant plants were identified and later genotyped with four additional adjacent markers located between RM6926 and RM3509. Finally, du12(t) was mapped to an 840-kb region on the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 6, delimited by SSR markers RM20662 and RM412, and co-segregated by RM3765 and RM176.
24133650	Optimization and partial characterization of culture conditions for the production of alkaline protease from Bacillus licheniformis P003.	2013	Springerplus	Proteolytic enzymes have occupied a pivotal position for their practical applications. The present study was carried out under shake flask conditions for the production of alkaline protease from Bacillus licheniformis P003 in basal medium containing glucose, peptone, K2HPO4, MgSO4 and Na2CO3 at pH 10. The effect of culture conditions and medium components for maximum production of alkaline protease was investigated using one factor constant at a time method along with its characterization. Maximum level of enzyme production was obtained after 48h of incubation with 2% inoculum size at 42°C, under continuous agitation at 150 rpm, in growth medium of pH 9. Highest enzyme production was obtained using 1% rice flour as carbon source and 0.8% beef extract as organic nitrogen source. Results indicated that single organic nitrogen source alone was more suitable than using in combinations and there was no significant positive effect of adding inorganic nitrogen sources in basal medium. After optimization of the parameters, enzyme production was increased about 20 fold than that of in basal medium. The crude enzyme was highly active at pH 10 and stable from pH 7-11. The enzyme showed highest activity (100%) at 50°C, and retained 78% relative activity at 70°C. Stability studies showed that the enzyme retained 75% of its initial activity after heating at 60°C for 1h. The enzyme retained about 66% and 46% of its initial activity after 28 days of storage at 4°C and room temperature (25°C) respectively. Mn(2+) and Mg(2+) increased the residual activity of the enzyme, whereas Fe(2+) moderately inhibited its residual activity. When pre-incubated with Tween-20, Tween-80, SDS and H2O2, each at 0.5% concentration, the enzyme showed increased residual activity. These characteristics may make the enzyme suitable for several industrial applications, especially in leather industries.
24161240	Accumulation of PrLeg, a Perilla legumin protein in potato tuber results in enhanced level of sulphur-containing amino acids.	2013	C R Biol	Potato is the fourth staple food in the world, following rice, wheat, and maize, whereas tubers contain high quality of starch, relatively high amounts of vitamin C and many other important substances. It also contains relatively good quality of protein (about 3 to 6% of the dried weight) and patatin, and 11S globulin is a major storage protein with high level of lysine. However, tuber protein contains relatively low amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids, which may result in low nutritional value. Recently, we cloned a gene encoding PrLeg polypeptide, a seed storage protein from Perilla, which contains relatively higher levels of sulphur-containing amino acids. We transformed PrLeg cDNA into a potato plant to over-express under the direction of the tuber-specific promoter, patatin. Most of the transgenic lines identified through PCR and RT-PCR analyses were able to accumulate high amount of prLeg transcript in their tuber tissue, while very little or no transcript that were detected in their leaf tissues. The level of methionine content was elevated up to three-fold compared to non-transgenic parental line, without any significant changes in other amino acids, suggesting that further research is required to get a deeper insight into their nutritional value.
24143239	Inhibition of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HT-29 colon cancer cells by rice-produced recombinant human insulin-like growth binding protein-3 (rhIGFBP-3).	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a multifunctional molecule which is closely related to cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metabolism and senescence. It combines with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) to form a complex (IGF-I/IGFBP-3) that can treat growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS) and reduce insulin requirement in patients with diabetes. IGFBP-3 alone has been shown to have anti-proliferation effect on numerous cancer cells.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reported here an expression method to produce functional recombinant human IGFBP-3 (rhIGFBP-3) in transgenic rice grains. Protein sorting sequences, signal peptide and endoplasmic reticulum retention tetrapeptide (KDEL) were included in constructs for enhancing rhIGFBP-3 expression. Western blot analysis showed that only the constructs with signal peptide were successfully expressed in transgenic rice grains. Both rhIGFBP-3 proteins, with or without KDEL sorting sequence inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (65.76 ± 1.72% vs 45.00 ± 0.86%, p < 0.05; 50.84 ± 1.97% vs 45.00 ± 0.86%, p < 0.01 respectively) and HT-29 colon cancer cells (65.14 ± 3.84% vs 18.01 ± 13.81%, p < 0.05 and 54.7 ± 9.44% vs 18.01 ± 13.81%, p < 0.05 respectively) when compared with wild type rice.

CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrated the feasibility of producing biological active rhIGFBP-3 in rice using a transgenic approach, which will definitely encourage more research on the therapeutic use of hIGFBP-3 in future.
24151305	In vitro binding of Sorghum bicolor transcription factors ABI4 and ABI5 to a conserved region of a GA 2-OXIDASE promoter: possible role of this interaction in the expression of seed dormancy.	2013	J Exp Bot	The precise adjustment of the timing of dormancy release according to final grain usage is still a challenge for many cereal crops. Grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] shows wide intraspecific variability in dormancy level and susceptibility to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS). Both embryo sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) metabolism play an important role in the expression of dormancy of the developing sorghum grain. In previous works, it was shown that, simultaneously with a greater embryo sensitivity to ABA and higher expression of SbABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (SbABI4) and SbABA-INSENSITIVE 5 (SbABI5), dormant grains accumulate less active GA4 due to a more active GA catabolism. In this work, it is demonstrated that the ABA signalling components SbABI4 and SbABI5 interact in vitro with a fragment of the SbGA 2-OXIDASE 3 (SbGA2ox3) promoter containing an ABA-responsive complex (ABRC). Both transcription factors were able to bind the promoter, although not simultaneously, suggesting that they might compete for the same cis-acting regulatory sequences. A biological role for these interactions in the expression of dormancy of sorghum grains is proposed: either SbABI4 and/or SbABI5 activate transcription of the SbGA2ox3 gene in vivo and promote SbGA2ox3 protein accumulation; this would result in active degradation of GA4, thus preventing germination of dormant grains. A comparative analysis of the 5'-regulatory region of GA2oxs from both monocots and dicots is also presented; conservation of the ABRC in closely related GA2oxs from Brachypodium distachyon and rice suggest that these species might share the same regulatory mechanism as proposed for grain sorghum.
24132771	The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Plastidial ribosome proteins (PRPs) form the major component of the plastidial ribosome. Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants. The early seedling leaves of the mutant were albino, as was the immature panicle at heading, and the phenotype was more strongly expressed in plants exposed to low temperature conditions. Changes in the leaf pigmentation of the mutant were due to altered chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. Positional cloning of WLP1, followed by complementation and knock-down experiments, showed that it encodes a 50S ribosome L13 protein. The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast. WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves. In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the low temperature. The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants. These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions. This is the first report on the function of PRPs in rice.
24205105	Macronutrient composition and sodium intake of diet are associated with risk of metabolic syndrome and hypertension in Korean women.	2013	PLoS One	Hypertension and hypertriglycemia are the most important contributors to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease risk in South Koreans with a relatively lean body mass. These major contributors differ from those identified in Western populations. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of the Korean diet associated with increased risk of MetS, whose prevalence has been steadily increasing in South Korea. On the basis of data collected from 5,320 subjects by the 2007-2008 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 3 dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis and their association with the risk of MetS and its components was examined. The balanced Korean diet, a typical Korean diet of rice and kimchi intake supplemented by a variety of foods had a desirable macronutrient composition and was associated with a lower risk of elevated blood pressure (OR=0.61, 95% CI=0.45-0.84) and hypertriglyceridemia (0.69, 0.49-0.88) in men and a lower risk of elevated blood pressure (0.59, 0.41-0.85) and MetS (0.67, 0.47-0.96) in women. The unbalanced Korean diet, characterized by a high intake of carbohydrates and sodium and little variety, was associated with a higher risk of MetS (1.44, 1.03-2.01) and elevated blood pressure (1.41, 1.00-1.98) in women. The semi-western diet, characterized by a relatively high intake of meat, poultry, and alcohol, was associated with a lower risk of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.70, 0.54-0.89) in women. Thus, macronutrient composition and sodium intake are associated with the risk of MetS and prehypertension in women. Maintaining a desirable macronutrient composition and avoiding excessive consumption of carbohydrates and sodium should be emphasized for prevention of MetS and hypertension in South Korean women.
24268168	Expression of Arabidopsis glycine-rich RNA-binding protein AtGRP2 or AtGRP7 improves grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa) under drought stress conditions.	2014	Plant Sci	Although posttranscriptional regulation of RNA metabolism is increasingly recognized as a key regulatory process in plant response to environmental stresses, reports demonstrating the importance of RNA metabolism control in crop improvement under adverse environmental stresses are severely limited. To investigate the potential use of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in developing stress-tolerant transgenic crops, we generated transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa) that express Arabidopsis thaliana glycine-rich RBP (AtGRP) 2 or 7, which have been determined to harbor RNA chaperone activity and confer stress tolerance in Arabidopsis, and analyzed the response of the transgenic rice plants to abiotic stresses. AtGRP2- or AtGRP7-expressing transgenic rice plants displayed similar phenotypes comparable with the wild-type plants under high salt or cold stress conditions. By contrast, AtGRP2- or AtGRP7-expressing transgenic rice plants showed much higher recovery rates and grain yields compared with the wild-type plants under drought stress conditions. The higher grain yield of the transgenic rice plants was due to the increases in filled grain numbers per panicle. Collectively, the present results show the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of RNA metabolism in plant response to environmental stress and suggest that GRPs can be utilized to improve the yield potential of crops under stress conditions.
24046061	SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 is a negative regulator of grain filling and gibberellin-mediated seedling establishment in rice.	2014	Mol Plant	Grain quality is an important agricultural trait that is mainly determined by grain size and composition. Here, we characterize the role of the rice transcription factor (TF) SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 (SERF1) during grain development. Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain filling. Loss of SERF1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains. Consistently, during grain filling, starch biosynthesis genes such as GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASEI (GBSSI), STARCH SYNTHASEI (SSI), SSIIIa, and ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT2 (AGPL2) are up-regulated in SERF1 knockout grains. Moreover, SERF1 is a direct upstream regulator of GBSSI. In addition, SERF1 negatively regulates germination by controlling RPBF expression, which mediates the gibberellic acid (GA)-induced expression of RICE AMYLASE1A (RAmy1A). Loss of SERF1 results in more rapid seedling establishment, while SERF1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Our study reveals that SERF1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF.
24131596	Secretome diversity and quantitative analysis of cellulolytic Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 in the presence of different carbon sources.	2013	Biotechnol Biofuels	BACKGROUND: Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 has a strong ability to decompose lignocellulose biomass, and its extracellular protein secretion has been reported in earlier studies employing traditional techniques. However, a comprehensive analysis of its secretion in the presence of different carbon sources is still lacking. The goal of this work was to identify, quantify and compare the secretome of A. fumigatus Z5 in the presence of different carbon sources to understand in more details the mechanisms of lignocellulose decomposition by Aspergillus fumigatus Z5.

RESULTS: Cellulolytic A. fumigatus Z5 was grown in the presence of glucose (Gl), Avicel (Av) and rice straw (RS), and the activities of several lignocellulosic enzymes were determined with chromatometry method. The maximum activities of endoglucanase, exoglucanase, β-glucosidase, laminarinase, lichenase, xylanase and pectin lyase were 12.52, 0.59, 2.30, 2.37, 1.68, 15.02 and 11.40 U·ml-1, respectively. A total of 152, 125 and 61 different proteins were identified in the presence of RS, Av and Gl, respectively, and the proteins were functionally divided into glycoside hydrolases, lipases, peptidases, peroxidases, esterases, protein translocating transporters and hypothetical proteins. A total of 49 proteins were iTRAQ-quantified in all the treatments, and the quantification results indicated that most of the cellulases, hemicellulases and glycoside hydrolases were highly upregulated when rice straw and Avicel were used as carbon sources (compared with glucose).

CONCLUSIONS: The proteins secreted from A. fumigatus Z5 in the present of different carbon source conditions were identified by LC-MS/MS and quantified by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. The results indicated that A. fumigatus Z5 could produce considerable cellulose-, hemicellulose-, pectin- and lignin-degrading enzymes that are valuable for the lignocellulosic bioenergy industry.
24130823	Maize root lectins mediate the interaction with Herbaspirillum seropedicae via N-acetyl glucosamine residues of lipopolysaccharides.	2013	PLoS One	Herbaspirillum seropedicae is a plant growth-promoting diazotrophic betaproteobacterium which associates with important crops, such as maize, wheat, rice and sugar-cane. We have previously reported that intact lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required for H. seropedicae attachment and endophytic colonization of maize roots. In this study, we present evidence that the LPS biosynthesis gene waaL (codes for the O-antigen ligase) is induced during rhizosphere colonization by H. seropedicae. Furthermore a waaL mutant strain lacking the O-antigen portion of the LPS is severely impaired in colonization. Since N-acetyl glucosamine inhibits H. seropedicae attachment to maize roots, lectin-like proteins from maize roots (MRLs) were isolated and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that MRL-1 and MRL-2 correspond to maize proteins with a jacalin-like lectin domain, while MRL-3 contains a B-chain lectin domain. These proteins showed agglutination activity against wild type H. seropedicae, but failed to agglutinate the waaL mutant strain. The agglutination reaction was severely diminished in the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine. Moreover addition of the MRL proteins as competitors in H. seropedicae attachment assays decreased 80-fold the adhesion of the wild type to maize roots. The results suggest that N-acetyl glucosamine residues of the LPS O-antigen bind to maize root lectins, an essential step for efficient bacterial attachment and colonization.
24116562	Exploring the dynamics of C/H and C/Cl exchanges in the C(3P) + C2H3Cl reaction.	2013	J Chem Phys	The dynamics of the C((3)P) + C2H3Cl reaction at collision energy 3.8 kcal mol(-1) was investigated in a crossed molecular-beam apparatus using synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet ionization. Time-of-flight spectra of products C3H2Cl, C3H3, and Cl were recorded at various laboratory scattering angles, from which translational-energy distributions and angular distributions of product channels C3H2Cl + H and C3H3 + Cl were derived. Cl correlates satisfactorily with C3H3 in linear momentum and angular distributions, which confirms the production of C3H3 + Cl. The H-loss (Cl-loss) channel has average translational-energy release 14.3 (8.8) kcal mol(-1) corresponding to a fraction 0.30 (0.14) of available energy into the translational degrees of freedom of product HCCCHCl + H (H2CCCH + Cl). The branching ratio of channel H to channel Cl was determined approximately as 12:88. The measurements of translational-energy releases and photoionization thresholds cannot distinguish HCCCHCl from H2CCCCl because both isomers have similar enthalpy of formation and ionization energy; nevertheless, the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus calculation prefers HCCCHCl. The measurement of photoionization spectra identifies product C3H3 as H2CCCH (propargyl). Both products C3H2Cl + H and C3H3 + Cl might correlate to the same triplet intermediate H2CCCHCl but have distinct angular distributions; the former is nearly isotropic whereas the latter is forward biased. A comparison with the C((3)P) + C2H3F reaction is stated.
24100330	Structural analysis and insights into the glycon specificity of the rice GH1 Os7BGlu26 β-D-mannosidase.	2013	Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr	Rice Os7BGlu26 is a GH1 family glycoside hydrolase with a threefold higher kcat/Km value for 4-nitrophenyl β-D-mannoside (4NPMan) compared with 4-nitrophenyl β-D-glucoside (4NPGlc). To investigate its selectivity for β-D-mannoside and β-D-glucoside substrates, the structures of apo Os7BGlu26 at a resolution of 2.20 Å and of Os7BGlu26 with mannose at a resolution of 2.45 Å were elucidated from isomorphous crystals in space group P212121. The (β/α)8-barrel structure is similar to other GH1 family structures, but with a narrower active-site cleft. The Os7BGlu26 structure with D-mannose corresponds to a product complex, with β-D-mannose in the (1)S5 skew-boat conformation. Docking of the (1)S3, (1)S5, (2)SO and (3)S1 pyranose-ring conformations of 4NPMan and 4NPGlc substrates into the active site of Os7BGlu26 indicated that the lowest energies were in the (1)S5 and (1)S3 skew-boat conformations. Comparison of these docked conformers with other rice GH1 structures revealed differences in the residues interacting with the catalytic acid/base between enzymes with and without β-D-mannosidase activity. The mutation of Tyr134 to Trp in Os7BGlu26 resulted in similar kcat/Km values for 4NPMan and 4NPGlc, while mutation of Tyr134 to Phe resulted in a 37-fold higher kcat/Km for 4NPMan than 4NPGlc. Mutation of Cys182 to Thr decreased both the activity and the selectivity for β-D-mannoside. It was concluded that interactions with the catalytic acid/base play a significant role in glycon selection.
24494239	Piriformospora indica rescues growth diminution of rice seedlings during high salt stress.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Piriformospora indica association has been reported to increase biotic as well as abiotic stress tolerance of its host plants. We analyzed the beneficial effect of P. indica association on rice seedlings during high salt stress conditions (200 and 300 mM NaCl). The growth parameters of rice seedlings such as root and shoot lengths or fresh and dry weights were found to be enhanced in P. indica-inoculated rice seedlings as compared with non-inoculated control seedlings, irrespective of whether they are exposed to salt stress or not. However, salt-stressed seedlings performed much better in the presence of the fungus compared with non-inoculated control seedlings. The photosynthetic pigment content [chlorophyll (Chl) a, Chl b, and carotenoids] was significantly higher in P. indica-inoculated rice seedlings under high salt stress conditions as compared with salt-treated non-inoculated rice seedlings, in which these pigments were found to be decreased. Proline accumulation was also observed during P. indica colonization, which may help the inoculated plants to become salt tolerant. Taken together, P. indica rescues growth diminution of rice seedlings under salt stress.
24260743	Preventive inositol hexaphosphate extracted from rice bran inhibits colorectal cancer through involvement of Wnt/β-catenin and COX-2 pathways.	2013	Biomed Res Int	Nutritional or dietary factors have drawn attention due to their potential as an effective chemopreventive agent, which is considered a more rational strategy in cancer treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of IP₆ extracted from rice bran on azoxymethane- (AOM-) induced colorectal cancer (CRC) in rats. Initially, male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups, with 6 rats in each group. The rats received two intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of AOM in saline (15 mg/kg body weight) over a 2-week period to induce CRC. IP₆ was given in three concentrations, 0.2% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v), and 1.0% (w/v), via drinking water for 16 weeks. The deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 have been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis. β-Catenin and COX-2 expressions were analysed using the quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Herein, we reported that the administration of IP₆ markedly suppressed the incidence of tumors when compared to the control. Interestingly, the administration of IP₆ had also markedly decreased β-catenin and COX-2 in colon tumors. Thus, the downregulation of β-catenin and COX-2 could play a role in inhibiting the CRC development induced by IP₆ and thereby act as a potent anticancer agent.
24269347	Understanding changes in cellulose crystalline structure of lignocellulosic biomass during ionic liquid pretreatment by XRD.	2014	Bioresour Technol	X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to understand the interactions of cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass with ionic liquids (ILs). The experiment was designed in such a way that the process of swelling and solubilization of crystalline cellulose in plant cell walls was followed by XRD. Three different feedstocks, switchgrass, corn stover and rice husk, were pretreated using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][OAc]) at temperatures of 50-130°C for 6h. At a 5 wt.% biomass loading, increasing pretreatment temperature led to a drop in biomass crystallinity index (CrI), which was due to swelling of crystalline cellulose. After most of the crystalline cellulose was swollen with IL molecules, a low-order structure was found in the pretreated samples. Upon further increasing temperature, cellulose II structure started to form in the pretreated biomass samples as a result of solubilization of cellulose in [C4mim][OAc] and subsequent regeneration.
24255867	Plant growth-promoting activities of Streptomyces spp. in sorghum and rice.	2013	Springerplus	Five strains of Streptomyces (CAI-24, CAI-121, CAI-127, KAI-32 and KAI-90) were earlier reported by us as biological control agents against Fusarium wilt of chickpea caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri (FOC). In the present study, the Streptomyces were characterized for enzymatic activities, physiological traits and further evaluated in greenhouse and field for their plant growth promotion (PGP) of sorghum and rice. All the Streptomyces produced lipase, β-1-3-glucanase and chitinase (except CAI-121 and CAI-127), grew in NaCl concentrations of up to 6%, at pH values between 5 and 13 and temperatures between 20 and 40°C and were highly sensitive to Thiram, Benlate, Captan, Benomyl and Radonil at field application level. When the Streptomyces were evaluated in the greenhouse on sorghum all the isolates significantly enhanced all the agronomic traits over the control. In the field, on rice, the Streptomyces significantly enhanced stover yield (up to 25%; except CAI-24), grain yield (up to 10%), total dry matter (up to 18%; except CAI-24) and root length, volume and dry weight (up to 15%, 36% and 55%, respectively, except CAI-24) over the control. In the rhizosphere soil, the Streptomyces significantly enhanced microbial biomass carbon (except CAI-24), nitrogen, dehydrogenase (except CAI-24), total N, available P and organic carbon (up to 41%, 52%, 75%, 122%, 53% and 13%, respectively) over the control. This study demonstrates that the selected Streptomyces which were antagonistic to FOC also have PGP properties.
24146224	Identification and characterization of a repertoire of genes differentially expressed in developing top ear shoots between a superior hybrid and its parental inbreds in Zea mays L.	2013	Mol Genet Genomics	Heterosis has been widely used in crop breeding and production; however, little is known about the genes controlling trait heterosis. The shortage of genes known to function in heterosis significantly limits our understanding of the molecular basis underlying heterosis. Here, we report 748 genes differentially expressed (DG) in the developing top ear shoots between a maize heterotic F1 hybrid (Mo17 × B73) and its parental inbreds identified using maize microarrays containing 28,608 unigene features. Of the 748 DG, over 600 were new for the inbred and hybrid combination. The DG were enriched for 35 of the total 213 maize gene ontology (GO) terms, including those describing photosynthesis, respiration, DNA replication, metabolism, and hormone biosynthesis. From the DG, we identified six genes involved in glycolysis, three genes in the citrate cycle, and four genes in the C4-dicarboxylic acid cycle. We mapped 533 of the 748 DG to the maize B73 genome, 298 (55.9 %) of which mapped to the QTL intervals of 11 maize ear traits. Moreover, we compared the repertoire of the DG with that of 14-day seedlings of the same inbred and hybrid combination. Only approximately 5 % of the DG was shared between the two organs and developmental stages. Furthermore, we mapped 417 (55.7 %) of the 748 maize DG to the QTL intervals of 26 rice yield-related traits. Therefore, this study provides a repertoire of genes useful for identification of genes involved in maize ear trait heterosis and information for a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying heterosis in maize.
24173912	CEBiP is the major chitin oligomer-binding protein in rice and plays a main role in the perception of chitin oligomers.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	CEBiP, a plasma membrane-localized glycoprotein of rice, directly binds with chitin elicitors (CE), and has been identified as a receptor for CE by using CEBiP-RNAi rice cells. To further clarify the function of CEBiP, we produced CEBiP-disrupted rice plants by applying an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated gene-targeting system based on homologous recombination, which has recently been developed for rice. Homologous recombination occurred at the CEBiP locus in ~0.5 % of the positive/negative selected calli. In the self-pollinated next generation, it was confirmed that the first exon of CEBiP was replaced with the hygromycin selection cassette as designed, and that the expression of CEBiP was completely deficient in homozygous cebip lines. Affinity-labeling analysis using biotinylated N-acetylchitooctaose demonstrated that CEBiP is the major CE-binding protein in rice cultured cells and leaves, which was consistent with the result that the response to CE in cebip cells was greatly diminished. Nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, only when the cebip leaf sheaths were inoculated with a weakly virulent strain, suggesting that CE perception during the infection process of M. oryzae is limited. The response to peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides in cebip cells was not affected, strongly suggesting that CEBiP is a CE-specific receptor.
24174541	P-MITE: a database for plant miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements.	2014	Nucleic Acids Res	Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are prevalent in eukaryotic species including plants. MITE families vary dramatically and usually cannot be identified based on homology. In this study, we de novo identified MITEs from 41 plant species, using computer programs MITE Digger, MITE-Hunter and/or Repetitive Sequence with Precise Boundaries (RSPB). MITEs were found in all, but one (Cyanidioschyzon merolae), species. Combined with the MITEs identified previously from the rice genome, >2.3 million sequences from 3527 MITE families were obtained from 41 plant species. In general, higher plants contain more MITEs than lower plants, with a few exceptions such as papaya, with only 538 elements. The largest number of MITEs is found in apple, with 237 302 MITE sequences. The number of MITE sequences in a genome is significantly correlated with genome size. A series of databases (plant MITE databases, P-MITE), available online at http://pmite.hzau.edu.cn/django/mite/, was constructed to host all MITE sequences from the 41 plant genomes. The databases are available for sequence similarity searches (BLASTN), and MITE sequences can be downloaded by family or by genome. The databases can be used to study the origin and amplification of MITEs, MITE-derived small RNAs and roles of MITEs on gene and genome evolution.
24117971	Robust anti-oxidant defences in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae confer tolerance to the host oxidative burst.	2014	New Phytol	Plants respond to pathogen attack via a rapid burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, ROS are also produced by fungal metabolism and are required for the development of infection structures in Magnaporthe oryzae. To obtain a better understanding of redox regulation in M. oryzae, we measured the amount and redox potential of glutathione (E(GSH)), as the major cytoplasmic anti-oxidant, the rates of ROS production, and mitochondrial activity using multi-channel four-dimensional (x,y,z,t) confocal imaging of Grx1-roGFP2 and fluorescent reporters during spore germination, appressorium formation and infection. High levels of mitochondrial activity and ROS were localized to the growing germ tube and appressorium, but E(GSH) was highly reduced and tightly regulated during development. Furthermore, germlings were extremely resistant to external H2O2 exposure ex planta. EGSH remained highly reduced during successful infection of the susceptible rice cultivar CO39. By contrast, there was a dramatic reduction in the infection of resistant (IR68) rice, but the sparse hyphae that did form also maintained a similar reduced E(GSH). We conclude that M. oryzae has a robust anti-oxidant defence system and maintains tight control of EGSH despite substantial oxidative challenge. Furthermore, the magnitude of the host oxidative burst alone does not stress the pathogen sufficiently to prevent infection in this pathosystem.
24280027	A point mutation in the zinc finger motif of RID1/EHD2/OsID1 protein leads to outstanding yield-related traits in japonica rice variety Wuyunjing 7.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Flowering time, which is often associated with the length of the growth period in rice, determines the adaptability of a plant to various environments. However, little is known about how flowering-time genes affect panicle development and yield formation potential in rice after inducing the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth.

RESULTS: To explore the relationship between floral induction and yield formation and the molecular mechanism of panicle development in rice, a novel mutant, ghd10, was identified from japonica variety Wuyunjing 7 plants subjected to ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) treatment. The ghd10 mutant exhibited delayed flowering time, tall stalks and increased panicle length and primary branch number. Map-based cloning revealed that Ghd10 encodes a transcription factor with Cys-2/His-2-type zinc finger motifs. Ghd10 is orthologous to INDETERMINATE1 (ID1), which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays) and is identical to the previously cloned genes Rice Indeterminate1 (RID1), Early heading date2 (Ehd2) and OsId1. Transient expression analysis of the Ghd10-GFP fusion protein in tobacco mesophyll cells showed that this protein is expressed in the nucleus. Ghd10 mRNA accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves and panicle structures, but rarely in roots. Expression analysis revealed that the expression levels of Ehd1, Hd1, RFT1, Hd3a and OsMADS15 decreased dramatically under both short-day and long-day conditions in ghd10.

CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Ghd10, which encodes a promoter of flowering, influences plant height and panicle development by regulating the expression levels of some flowering-related genes, such as Ehd1, Hd1, OsMADS15 and others. The ghd10 allele is a useful resource for improvement of panicle traits in rice grown in tropical and low-latitude areas.
23963804	Reduced aflatoxin exposure presages decline in liver cancer mortality in an endemic region of China.	2013	Cancer Prev Res (Phila)	Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality globally. In endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, PLC largely arises from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and ingestion of aflatoxins. Although synergistic interactions between these two risk factors have been observed in cohort studies in China, here we determined the impact of agricultural reforms in the 1980s leading to diminished maize consumption and implementation of subsidized universal vaccination against HBV in the 2000s on PLC primary prevention. A population-based cancer registry was used to track PLC mortality in Qidong, China and was compared with the timeline of HBV immunization. Randomly selected serum samples from archived cohort collections from the 1980s to present were analyzed for aflatoxin biomarkers. More than 50% reductions in PLC mortality rates occurred across birth cohorts from the 1960s to the 1980s for Qidongese less than 35 years of age although all were born before universal vaccination of newborns. Median levels of the aflatoxin biomarker decreased from 19.3 pg/mg albumin in 1989 to undetectable (<0.5 pg/mg) by 2009. A population attributable benefit of 65% for reduced PLC mortality was estimated from a government-facilitated switch of dietary staple from maize to rice; 83% of this benefit was in those infected with HBV. Food policy reforms in China resulted in a dramatic decrease in aflatoxin exposure, which, independent of HBV vaccination, reduced liver cancer risk. The extensive HBV vaccine coverage now in place augurs even greater risk reductions in the future.
23987653	P-TRAP: a Panicle TRAit Phenotyping tool.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: In crops, inflorescence complexity and the shape and size of the seed are among the most important characters that influence yield. For example, rice panicles vary considerably in the number and order of branches, elongation of the axis, and the shape and size of the seed. Manual low-throughput phenotyping methods are time consuming, and the results are unreliable. However, high-throughput image analysis of the qualitative and quantitative traits of rice panicles is essential for understanding the diversity of the panicle as well as for breeding programs.

RESULTS: This paper presents P-TRAP software (Panicle TRAit Phenotyping), a free open source application for high-throughput measurements of panicle architecture and seed-related traits. The software is written in Java and can be used with different platforms (the user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses Netbeans Platform 7.3). The application offers three main tools: a tool for the analysis of panicle structure, a spikelet/grain counting tool, and a tool for the analysis of seed shape. The three tools can be used independently or simultaneously for analysis of the same image. Results are then reported in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Values (CSV) file formats. Images of rice panicles were used to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the software. Compared to data obtained by manual processing, P-TRAP produced reliable results in a much shorter time. In addition, manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are vulnerable to damage. The software is very useful, practical and collects much more data than human operators.

CONCLUSIONS: P-TRAP is a new open source software that automatically recognizes the structure of a panicle and the seeds on the panicle in numeric images. The software processes and quantifies several traits related to panicle structure, detects and counts the grains, and measures their shape parameters. In short, P-TRAP offers both efficient results and a user-friendly environment for experiments. The experimental results showed very good accuracy compared to field operator, expert verification and well-known academic methods.
23970084	QTL mapping and correlation analysis for 1000-grain weight and percentage of grains with chalkiness in rice.	2013	J Genet	The study of 1000-grain weight (TGW) and percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) is very important in rice. In this study, a set of introgression lines (ILs), derived from Sasanishiki/Habataki with Sasanishiki as the recurrent parent, were used to detect correlations and quantitative trait loci (QTL) on TGW and PGWC in two different environments. Phenotypic correlation analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between TGW and PGWC in both environments, which indicated that the linkage of TGW and PGWC traits could be broken via suitable population. A total of 20 QTL were detected in both environments, nine QTL for 1000-paddy-grain weight (PTGW), five QTL for 1000-brown-grain weight (BTGW) and six QTL for percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC). Moreover, five QTL, qPTGW3, qPTGW8.2, qPTGW11.1 for PTGW and qPGWC1.1, qPGWC1.2 for PGWC, were stably expressed in both environments. Phenotypic values were significantly different (P < 0.01) between the introgression lines carrying these five QTL alleles and the genetic background parent, Sasanishiki. The introgression lines carrying these QTL also represent a useful genetic resource in the context of rice yield and quality improvement via a design-breeding approach.
23965973	Effects of reduced prolamin on seed storage protein composition and the nutritional quality of rice.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Rice seed storage proteins accumulate in two types of protein body (PB-I and PB-II) that are nutrient sources for animals. PB-I is indigestible and negatively affects rice protein quality. To improve the nutritional value of rice seeds we are aiming to engineer the composition and accumulation of endogenous seed storage proteins. In this study we generated transgenic rice plants in which 13 kD prolamin genes were suppressed by RNA interference (13 kD pro-RNAi). Analysis based on qRT-PCR confirmed that the targeted 13 kD prolamins were markedly suppressed, and were compensated for by an increase in other storage proteins including 10 kD prolamin, glutelins, and chaperone proteins. The storage protein profiles further revealed that the levels of 13 kD prolamins were significantly reduced, while that of the glutelin precursor was slightly increased and the remaining storage proteins did not change. Amino acid analysis showed that the reduction of 13 kD prolamins resulted in a 28% increase in the lysine content relative to the wild type, indicating that the 13 kD pro-RNAi rice seeds are more nutritious. Furthermore, a reduction in the levels of 13 kD prolamins resulted in abnormal formation of PB-I, which was small and had no lamellar structure. These results suggest that alteration of prolamins can contribute to improving the nutritional quality of rice.
23990303	Cell-surface expression of Aspergillus saitoi-derived functional α-1,2-mannosidase on Yarrowia lipolytica for glycan remodeling.	2013	J Microbiol	Expression of proteins on the surface of yeast has a wide range of applications, such as development of live vaccines, screening of antibody libraries, and use as whole-cell biocatalysts. The hemiascomycetes yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has been raised as a potential host for heterologous expression of recombinant proteins. In this study, we report the expression of Aspergillus saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase, encoded by the msdS gene, on the cell surface of Y. lipolytica. As the first step to achieve the secretory expression of msdS protein, four different signal sequences-derived from the endogenous Y. lipolytica Lip2 and Xpr2 prepro regions and the heterologous A. niger α-amylase and rice α-amylase signal sequences-were analyzed for their secretion efficiency. It was shown that the YlLip2 prepro sequence was most efficient in directing the secretory expression of msdS in fully N-glycosylated forms. The surface display of msdS was subsequently directed by fusing GPI anchoring motifs derived from Y. lipolytica cell wall proteins, YlCwp1p and YlYwp1p, respectively, to the C-terminus of the Lip2 prepro-msdS protein. The expression of actively functional msdS protein on the cell surface was confirmed by western blot, flow cytometry analysis, along with the α-1,2-mannosidase activity assay using intact Y. lipolytica cells as the enzyme source. Furthermore, the glycoengineered Y. lipolytica Δoch1Δmpo1 strains displaying α-1,2-mannosidase were able to convert Man8GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 efficiently on their cell-wall mannoproteins, demonstrating its potential used for glycoengineering in vitro or in vivo.
23950663	Treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids with green tea extract: a pilot randomized controlled clinical study.	2013	Int J Womens Health	BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids (UFs, also known as leiomyoma) affect 70% of reproductive-age women. Imposing a major burden on health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) of premenopausal women, UF is a public health concern. There are no effective medicinal treatment options currently available for women with symptomatic UF.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of green tea extract (epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]) on UF burden and quality of life in women with symptomatic UF, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

METHODS: A total of 39 reproductive-age women (age 18-50 years, day 3 serum follicle-stimulating hormone <10 \U/mL) with symptomatic UF were recruited for this study. All subjects had at least one fibroid lesion 2 cm(3) or larger, as confirmed by transvaginal ultrasonography. The subjects were randomized to oral daily treatment with either 800 mg of green tea extract (45% EGCG) or placebo (800 mg of brown rice) for 4 months, and UF volumes were measured at the end, also by transvaginal ultrasonography. The fibroid-specific symptom severity and HRQL of these UF patients were scored at each monthly visit, using the symptom severity and quality-of-life questionnaires. Student's t-test was used to evaluate statistical significance of treatment effect between the two groups.

RESULTS: Of the final 39 women recruited for the study, 33 were compliant and completed all five visits of the study. In the placebo group (n = 11), fibroid volume increased (24.3%) over the study period; however, patients randomized to green tea extract (n = 22, 800 mg/day) treatment showed significant reduction (32.6%, P = 0.0001) in total UF volume. In addition, EGCG treatment significantly reduced fibroid-specific symptom severity (32.4%, P = 0.0001) and induced significant improvement in HRQL (18.53%, P = 0.01) compared to the placebo group. Anemia also significantly improved by 0.7 g/dL (P = 0.02) in the EGCG treatment group, while average blood loss significantly decreased from 71 mL/month to 45 mL/month (P = 0.001). No adverse effects, endometrial hyperplasia, or other endometrial pathology were observed in either group.

CONCLUSION: EGCG shows promise as a safe and effective therapeutic agent for women with symptomatic UFs. Such a simple, inexpensive, and orally administered therapy can improve women's health globally.
23907258	Design and application of an in vivo reporter assay for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is an important enzyme that links primary metabolism to secondary metabolism. Its efficiency is often a critical factor that affects the overall flux of a related metabolic pathway, the titer of the final products, and the efficacy of PAL-based therapies. Thus, PAL is a common target for metabolic engineering, and it is of significant interest to screen efficient PALs for industrial and medical applications. In this study, a novel and efficient visible reporter assay for screening of PAL efficiency in Escherichia coli was established based on a plant type III polyketide biosynthetic pathway. The candidate PALs were co-expressed with a 4-coumarate:CoA ligase 4CL1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and curcuminoid synthase (CUS) from Oryza sativa in E. coli BL21(DE3) to form a dicinnamoylmethane biosynthetic pathway. Taking advantage of the yellow color of the product, a microplate-based assay was designed to measure the titer of dicinnamoylmethane, which was validated by HPLC analysis. The different titers of the product reflect the overall performance (expression level and enzymatic activity) of the individual PALs in E. coli. Using this system, we have screened three PALs (PAL1, PAL3, and PAL4) from Trifolium pratense, among which PAL1 showed the best performance in E. coli. The engineered E. coli strain containing PAL1, 4CL1, and CUS led to the production of dicinnamoylmethane at a high level of 0.36 g/l. Supplement of 2-fluoro-phenylalanine yielded two fluorinated dicinnamoylmethane derivatives, 6,6'-difluoro-dicinnamoylmethane and 6-fluoro-dicinnamoylmethane, of which the latter is a new curcuminoid.
23986463	Mosquito larval source management for controlling malaria.	2013	Cochrane Database Syst Rev	BACKGROUND: Malaria is an important cause of illness and death in people living in many parts of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduce malaria transmission by targeting the adult mosquito vector and are key components of malaria control programmes. However, mosquito numbers may also be reduced by larval source management (LSM), which targets mosquito larvae as they mature in aquatic habitats. This is conducted by permanently or temporarily reducing the availability of larval habitats (habitat modification and habitat manipulation), or by adding substances to standing water that either kill or inhibit the development of larvae (larviciding).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of mosquito LSM for preventing malaria.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CABS Abstracts; and LILACS up to 24 October 2012. We handsearched the Tropical Diseases Bulletin from 1900 to 2010, the archives of the World Health Organization (up to 11 February 2011), and the literature database of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (up to 2 March 2011). We also contacted colleagues in the field for relevant articles.

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included cluster randomized controlled trials (cluster-RCTs), controlled before-and-after trials with at least one year of baseline data, and randomized cross-over trials that compared LSM with no LSM for malaria control. We excluded trials that evaluated biological control of anopheline mosquitoes with larvivorous fish.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors assessed each trial for eligibility. We extracted data and at least two authors independently determined the risk of bias in the included studies. We resolved all disagreements through discussion with a third author. We analyzed the data using Review Manager 5 software.

MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies; four cluster-RCTs, eight controlled before-and-after trials, and one randomized cross-over trial. The included studies evaluated habitat modification (one study), habitat modification with larviciding (two studies), habitat manipulation (one study), habitat manipulation plus larviciding (two studies), or larviciding alone (seven studies) in a wide variety of habitats and countries. Malaria incidenceIn two cluster-RCTs undertaken in Sri Lanka, larviciding of abandoned mines, streams, irrigation ditches, and rice paddies reduced malaria incidence by around three-quarters compared to the control (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.31, 20,124 participants, two trials, moderate quality evidence). In three controlled before-and-after trials in urban and rural India and rural Kenya, results were inconsistent (98,233 participants, three trials, very low quality evidence). In one trial in urban India, the removal of domestic water containers together with weekly larviciding of canals and stagnant pools reduced malaria incidence by three quarters. In one trial in rural India and one trial in rural Kenya, malaria incidence was higher at baseline in intervention areas than in controls. However dam construction in India, and larviciding of streams and swamps in Kenya, reduced malaria incidence to levels similar to the control areas. In one additional randomized cross-over trial in the flood plains of the Gambia River, where larval habitats were extensive and ill-defined, larviciding by ground teams did not result in a statistically significant reduction in malaria incidence (2039 participants, one trial). Parasite prevalenceIn one cluster-RCT from Sri Lanka, larviciding reduced parasite prevalence by almost 90% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22, 2963 participants, one trial, moderate quality evidence). In five controlled before-and-after trials in Greece, India, the Philippines, and Tanzania, LSM resulted in an average reduction in parasite prevalence of around two-thirds (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55, 8041 participants, five trials, moderate quality evidence). The interventions in these five trials included dam construction to reduce larval habitats, flushing of streams, removal of domestic water containers, and larviciding. In the randomized cross-over trial in the flood plains of the Gambia River, larviciding by ground teams did not significantly reduce parasite prevalence (2039 participants, one trial).

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In Africa and Asia, LSM is another policy option, alongside LLINs and IRS, for reducing malaria morbidity in both urban and rural areas where a sufficient proportion of larval habitats can be targeted. Further research is needed to evaluate whether LSM is appropriate or feasible in parts of rural Africa where larval habitats are more extensive.
23974369	Biases in community structures of ammonia/ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms caused by insufficient DNA extractions from Baijiang soil revealed by comparative analysis of coastal wetland sediment and rice paddy soil.	2013	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Repetitive extraction of DNAs from surface sediments of a coastal wetland in Mai Po Nature Reserve (MP) of Hong Kong and surface Baijiang soils from a rice paddy (RP) in Northeast China was conducted to compare the microbial diversity in this study. Community structures of ammonia/ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms in these samples were analyzed by PCR-DGGE technique. The diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria were also analyzed based on archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit A encoding (amoA) and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes, respectively. DGGE profiles of archaeal and bacterial amoA and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed a similar pattern among all five repetitively extracted DNA fractions from both MP and RP, except the anammox bacteria in RP, indicating a more diverse anammox community retrieved in the second to the fifth fractions than the first one. Both soil and marine group AOA were detected while soil and coastal group AOB and Scalindua-anammox bacteria were dominant in MP. Soil group AOA and marine group AOB were dominant in RP, while both Scalindua and Kuenenia species were detected in RP. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA and anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes was significantly correlated with the DNA concentrations of the five DNA fractions from MP, but not from RP (except the archaeal amoA gene). Results suggest that anammox bacteria diversity may be biased by insufficient DNA extraction of rice paddy soil samples.
23939432	Suppression of the external mitochondrial NADPH dehydrogenase, NDB1, in Arabidopsis thaliana affects central metabolism and vegetative growth.	2014	Mol Plant	Ca(2+)-dependent oxidation of cytosolic NADPH is mediated by NDB1, which is an external type II NADPH dehydrogenase in the plant mitochondrial electron transport chain. Using RNA interference, the NDB1 transcript was suppressed by 80% in Arabidopsis thaliana plants, and external Ca(2+)-dependent NADPH dehydrogenase activity became undetectable in isolated mitochondria. This was linked to a decreased level of NADP(+) in rosettes of the transgenic lines. Sterile-grown transgenic seedlings displayed decreased growth specifically on glucose, and respiratory metabolism of (14)C-glucose was increased. On soil, NDB1-suppressing plants had a decreased vegetative biomass, but leaf maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II and CO2 assimilation rates, as well as total respiration, were similar to the wild-type. The in vivo alternative oxidase activity and capacity were also similar in all genotypes. Metabolic profiling revealed decreased levels of sugars, citric acid cycle intermediates, and amino acids in the transgenic lines. The NDB1-suppression induced transcriptomic changes associated with protein synthesis and glucosinolate and jasmonate metabolism. The transcriptomic changes also overlapped with changes observed in a mutant lacking ABAINSENSITIVE4 and in A. thaliana overexpressing stress tolerance genes from rice. The results thus indicate that A. thaliana NDB1 modulates NADP(H) reduction levels, which in turn affect central metabolism and growth, and interact with defense signaling.
23984709	Interaction between two rice mitogen activated protein kinases and its possible role in plant defense.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The canonical mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays a vital role in carrying out the normal growth and development of the plant. The pathway, connecting the upstreams signal with the downstream target is considered to be linear, mostly starting with a MAPKKK and ending in a MAPK.

RESULTS: Here we report a novel interaction between two rice MAPKs, OsMPK20-4 and OsMPK3 suggesting the complex nature of the pathway rather than a linear one at individual steps. The interaction between OsMPK20-4 and OsMPK3 found by yeast two-hybrid analysis was confirmed in planta by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. The interaction is specific and is phosphorylation independent. The results suggest a role of the interaction between OsMPK20-4 and OsMPK3 in basic plant defense.

CONCLUSIONS: The current novel work showing the physical interaction between two plant MAPKs, OsMPK20-4 and OsMPK3 is the diversion from the dogma of a typical MAPK cascade thereby opening a new dimension to the MAPK signal transduction.
23975147	Coexpression network analysis associated with call of rice seedlings for encountering heat stress.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Coexpression network analysis is useful tool for identification of functional association of coexpressed genes. We developed a coexpression network of rice from heat stress transcriptome data. Global transcriptome of rice leaf tissues was performed by microarray at three time points--post 10 and 60 min heat stress at 42 °C and 30 min recovery at 26 °C following 60 min 42 °C heat stress to investigate specifically the early events in the heat stress and recovery response. The transcriptome profile was significantly modulated within 10 min of heat stress. Strikingly, the number of up-regulated genes was higher than the number of down-regulated genes in 10 min of heat stress. The enrichment of GO terms protein kinase activity/protein serine threonine kinase activity, response to heat and reactive oxygen species in up-regulated genes after 10 min signifies the role of signal transduction events and reactive oxygen species during early heat stress. The enrichment of transcription factor (TF) binding sites for heat shock factors, bZIPs and DREBs coupled with up-regulation of TFs of different families suggests that the heat stress response in rice involves integration of various regulatory networks. The interpretation of microarray data in the context of coexpression network analysis identified several functionally correlated genes consisting of previously documented heat upregulated genes as well as new genes that can be implicated in heat stress. Based on the findings on parallel analysis of growth of seedlings, associated changes in transcripts of selected Hsps, genome-wide microarray profiling and the coexpression network analysis, this study is a step forward in understanding heat response of rice, the world's most important food crop.
23979931	Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality.	2013	G3 (Bethesda)	Plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) are essential for ribosome biogenesis, plastid protein biosynthesis, chloroplast differentiation, and early chloroplast development. This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage. This albino phenotype was associated with altered chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast. ASL1 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues. In addition, ASL1 expression was regulated by light. The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable. Our findings indicate that nuclear-encoded PRPS20 plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.
23934749	Crystal structures of α-dioxygenase from Oryza sativa: insights into substrate binding and activation by hydrogen peroxide.	2013	Protein Sci	α-Dioxygenases (α-DOX) are heme-containing enzymes found predominantly in plants and fungi, where they generate oxylipins in response to pathogen attack. α-DOX oxygenate a variety of 14-20 carbon fatty acids containing up to three unsaturated bonds through stereoselective removal of the pro-R hydrogen from the α-carbon by a tyrosyl radical generated via the oxidation of the heme moiety by hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). We determined the X-ray crystal structures of wild type α-DOX from Oryza sativa, the wild type enzyme in complex with H2 O2 , and the catalytically inactive Y379F mutant in complex with the fatty acid palmitic acid (PA). PA binds within the active site cleft of α-DOX such that the carboxylate forms ionic interactions with His-311 and Arg-559. Thr-316 aids in the positioning of carbon-2 for hydrogen abstraction. Twenty-five of the twenty eight contacts made between PA and residues lining the active site occur within the carboxylate and first eight carbons, indicating that interactions within this region of the substrate are responsible for governing selectivity. Comparison of the wild type and H2 O2 structures provides insight into enzyme activation. The binding of H2 O2 at the distal face of the heme displaces residues His-157, Asp-158, and Trp-159 ≈ 2.5 Å from their positions in the wild type structure. As a result, the Oδ2 atom of Asp-158 interacts with the Ca atom in the calcium binding loop, the side chains of Trp-159 and Trp-213 reorient, and the guanidinium group of Arg-559 is repositioned near Tyr-379, poised to interact with the carboxylate group of the substrate.
23914840	Coupled unimolecular dissociation kinetics of bromotoluene radical cations.	2013	J Phys Chem A	The unimolecular dissociations of o-, m-, and p-bromotoluene radical cations to C7H7(+) (benzylium and tropylium) are examined by considering the coupling of the three isomers in the dissociation pathways. The potential energy surface obtained from ab initio calculations suggests the interconversion of isomers through methylene and hydrogen migrations on the ring. The rate equations for each isomer are combined together to form a rate matrix for coupled reactions. The rate matrix contains the microcanonical rate constants for all elementary steps, which are calculated using Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory based on the molecular parameters obtained from density functional theory. The unimolecular dissociation rates for coupled reactions are determined by numerically solving the matrix equation. As a result of reaction coupling, the product branching ratio becomes time-dependent and the reaction rates of three isomers become parallel to one another as the energy increases, although their initial rates differently vary with energy. The calculated rate-energy curves fall below the time-resolved photodissociation data in the energy range 2.2-2.7 eV but are in line with the photoelectron photoion coincidence data in the energy range 2.7-3.5 eV. The discrepancy between experiment and theory in the low-energy region is ascribed to the uncertainties of the potential energy surface as well as the contribution of the radiative relaxation rate that has not been taken into account in the theoretical calculations. The rate-energy curves are then used to calculate the thermal reaction rate constants, and the Arrhenius parameters are determined in the temperature range 700-1300 K. Comparison of the activation energy and entropy obtained from the Arrhenius plot with the calculated enthalpy and entropy changes between the reactant and the highest-lying transition state suggests that a series of [1,2] H-atom migrations occurring near the entrance comprise the rate-determining steps and the subsequent [1,2] H-atom migrations play an important role in increasing the activation energy and decreasing the entropy by reducing the net flux to the exit.
23975246	Gene discovery and functional marker development for fragrance in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench).	2013	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Sequence analysis and genetic mapping revealed that a 1,444 bp deletion causes a premature stop codon in SbBADH2 of sorghum IS19912. The non-function of SbBADH2 is responsible for fragrance in sorghum IS19912. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) is a potent volatile compound causing fragrance in several plants and foods. Seeds of some varieties of rice, sorghum and soybean possess fragrance. The genes responsible for fragrance in rice and soybean are orthologs that correspond to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2). Genotypes harboring fragrance in rice and soybean contain a premature stop codon in BADH2 which impairs the synthesis of full length functional BADH2 protein leading to the accumulation of 2AP. In this study, we reported an association between the BADH2 gene and fragrance in sorghum. An F2 population of 187 plants developed from a cross between KU630 (non-fragrant) and IS19912 (fragrant) was used. Leaves of F2 and F3 progenies were evaluated for fragrance by organoleptic test, while seeds of F2 plants were analyzed for 2AP. The tests consistently showed that the fragrance is controlled by a single recessive gene. Gene expression analysis of SbBADH1 and SbBADH2 in leaves of KU630 and IS19912 at various stages revealed that SbBADH1 and SbBADH2 were expressed in both accessions. Sequence comparison between KU630 and IS19912 revealed a continuous 1,444 bp deletion encompassing exon 12 to 15 of SbBADH2 in IS19912 which introduces a frameshift mutation and thus causes a premature stop codon. An indel marker was developed to detect polymorphism in SbBADH2. Bulk segregant and QTL analyses confirmed the association between SbBADH2 and fragrance.
23990797	Brittle Culm1, a COBRA-like protein, functions in cellulose assembly through binding cellulose microfibrils.	2013	PLoS Genet	Cellulose represents the most abundant biopolymer in nature and has great economic importance. Cellulose chains pack laterally into crystalline forms, stacking into a complicated crystallographic structure. However, the mechanism of cellulose crystallization is poorly understood. Here, via functional characterization, we report that Brittle Culm1 (BC1), a COBRA-like protein in rice, modifies cellulose crystallinity. BC1 was demonstrated to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein and can be released into cell walls by removal of the GPI anchor. BC1 possesses a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) at its N-terminus. In vitro binding assays showed that this CBM interacts specifically with crystalline cellulose, and several aromatic residues in this domain are essential for binding. It was further demonstrated that cell wall-localized BC1 via the CBM and GPI anchor is one functional form of BC1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) assays revealed that mutations in BC1 and knockdown of BC1 expression decrease the crystallite width of cellulose; overexpression of BC1 and the CBM-mutated BC1s caused varied crystallinity with results that were consistent with the in vitro binding assay. Moreover, interaction between the CBM and cellulose microfibrils was largely repressed when the cell wall residues were pre-stained with two cellulose dyes. Treating wild-type and bc1 seedlings with the dyes resulted in insensitive root growth responses in bc1 plants. Combined with the evidence that BC1 and three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs) function in different steps of cellulose production as revealed by genetic analysis, we conclude that BC1 modulates cellulose assembly by interacting with cellulose and affecting microfibril crystallinity.
23954326	Selection of reference genes for gene expression studies in virus-infected monocots using quantitative real-time PCR.	2013	J Biotechnol	Both genome-wide transcriptomic surveys of the mRNA expression profiles and virus-induced gene silencing-based molecular studies of target gene during virus-plant interaction involve the precise estimation of the transcript abundance. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most widely adopted technique for mRNA quantification. In order to obtain reliable quantification of transcripts, identification of the best reference genes forms the basis of the preliminary work. Nevertheless, the stability of internal controls in virus-infected monocots needs to be fully explored. In this work, the suitability of ten housekeeping genes (ACT, EF1α, FBOX, GAPDH, GTPB, PP2A, SAND, TUBβ, UBC18 and UK) for potential use as reference genes in qPCR were investigated in five different monocot plants (Brachypodium, barley, sorghum, wheat and maize) under infection with different viruses including Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). By using three different algorithms, the most appropriate reference genes or their combinations were identified for different experimental sets and their effectiveness for the normalisation of expression studies were further validated by quantitative analysis of a well-studied PR-1 gene. These results facilitate the selection of desirable reference genes for more accurate gene expression studies in virus-infected monocots.
23933238	Chemical constituents from the rice fermented with the edible mushroom Pleurotus eryngii and their quinone oxidoreductase 1 inducing effect.	2013	Fitoterapia	The fruiting bodies or mycelia of mushrooms have been used as food and food-flavoring material for centuries due to their nutritional and medicinal values and the diversity of their bioactive components. The present research was the first to study the chemical components in rice fermented with the edible mushroom Pleurotus eryngii and the quinone oxidoreductase 1 inducing effect of these compounds. Through chemical investigation, one new compound, ((6S,7S)-6,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-2-(3-methylbutanoyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran-3-yl)methyl acetate (1) and eight known compounds (2-9) were isolated from the P. eryngii-fermented rice. All of these compounds were isolated from rice fermented with the edible mushroom P. eryngii for the first time. Their structures were elucidated by MS and NMR data analyses. Alternariol-5-O-methyl ether (2) showed strong quinone oxidoreductase 1 inducing effect with an IR value of 2.58 at the concentration of 20 μg/ml. The content of adenosine (8) in the fermented rice (175.64 μg/g) is much higher than that of non-fermented rice (14.38 μg/g).
23951162	Characterization and evolution of conserved MicroRNA through duplication events in date palm (Phoenix dactylifera).	2013	PLoS One	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in a wide range of species. Highly conserved miRNAs regulate ancestral transcription factors common to all plants, and control important basic processes such as cell division and meristem function. We selected 21 conserved miRNA families to analyze the distribution and maintenance of miRNAs. Recently, the first genome sequence in Palmaceae was released: date palm (Phoenix dactylifera). We conducted a systematic miRNA analysis in date palm, computationally identifying and characterizing the distribution and duplication of conserved miRNAs in this species compared to other published plant genomes. A total of 81 miRNAs belonging to 18 miRNA families were identified in date palm. The majority of miRNAs in date palm and seven other well-studied plant species were located in intergenic regions and located 4 to 5 kb away from the nearest protein-coding genes. Sequence comparison showed that 67% of date palm miRNA members were present in duplicated segments, and that 135 pairs of miRNA-containing segments were duplicated in Arabidopsis, tomato, orange, rice, apple, poplar and soybean with a high similarity of non coding sequences between duplicated segments, indicating genomic duplication was a major force for expansion of conserved miRNAs. Duplicated miRNA pairs in date palm showed divergence in pre-miRNA sequence and in number of promoters, implying that these duplicated pairs may have undergone divergent evolution. Comparisons between date palm and the seven other plant species for the gain/loss of miR167 loci in an ancient segment shared between monocots and dicots suggested that these conserved miRNAs were highly influenced by and diverged as a result of genomic duplication events.
23940254	The ureide-degrading reactions of purine ring catabolism employ three amidohydrolases and one aminohydrolase in Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Several ureides are intermediates of purine base catabolism, releasing nitrogen from the purine nucleotides for reassimilation into amino acids. In some legumes like soybean (Glycine max), ureides are used for nodule-to-shoot translocation of fixed nitrogen. Four enzymes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), (1) allantoinase, (2) allantoate amidohydrolase (AAH), (3) ureidoglycine aminohydrolase, and (4) ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (UAH), catalyze the complete hydrolysis of the ureide allantoin in vitro. However, the metabolic route in vivo remains controversial. Here, in growth and metabolite analyses of Arabidopsis mutants, we demonstrate that these enzymes are required for allantoin degradation in vivo. Orthologous enzymes are present in soybean, encoded by one to four gene copies. All isoenzymes are active in vitro, while some may be inefficiently translated in vivo. Surprisingly, transcript and protein amounts are not significantly regulated by nitrogen fixation or leaf ureide content. A requirement for soybean AAH and UAH for ureide catabolism in leaves has been demonstrated by the use of virus-induced gene silencing. Functional AAH, ureidoglycine aminohydrolase, and UAH are also present in rice (Oryza sativa), and orthologous genes occur in all other plant genomes sequenced to date, indicating that the amidohydrolase route of ureide degradation is universal in plants, including mosses (e.g. Physcomitrella patens) and algae (e.g. Chlamydomomas reinhardtii).
23955173	Sequence organization and evolutionary dynamics of Brachypodium-specific centromere retrotransposons.	2013	Chromosome Res	Brachypodium distachyon is a wild annual grass belonging to the Pooideae, more closely related to wheat, barley, and forage grasses than rice and maize. As an experimental model, the completed genome sequence of B. distachyon provides a unique opportunity to study centromere evolution during the speciation of grasses. Centromeric satellite sequences have been identified in B. distachyon, but little is known about centromeric retrotransposons in this species. In the present study, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-fluorescence in situ hybridization was conducted in maize, rice, barley, wheat, and rye using B. distachyon (Bd) centromere-specific BAC clones. Eight Bd centromeric BAC clones gave no detectable fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signals on the chromosomes of rice and maize, and three of them also did not yield any FISH signals in barley, wheat, and rye. In addition, four of five Triticeae centromeric BAC clones did not hybridize to the B. distachyon centromeres, implying certain unique features of Brachypodium centromeres. Analysis of Brachypodium centromeric BAC sequences identified a long terminal repeat (LTR)-centromere retrotransposon of B. distachyon (CRBd1). This element was found in high copy number accounting for 1.6 % of the B. distachyon genome, and is enriched in Brachypodium centromeric regions. CRBd1 accumulated in active centromeres, but was lost from inactive ones. The LTR of CRBd1 appears to be specific to B. distachyon centromeres. These results reveal different evolutionary events of this retrotransposon family across grass species.
23974358	Analysis of DNA repair helicase UvrD from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins play important roles in maintaining genome stability in all the organisms. Studies of MMR genes in plants have identified several homologs of the Escherichia coli genes. Crop yield is directly related to genome stability, which is crucially required for optimal plant growth and development. Numerous genotoxic stresses such as UV light, radiations, pollutants and heavy metals cause DNA damage leading to genome instability, which can interfere with the plant growth and crop productivity. But the efficient repair mechanisms can help to overcome the deleterious effects of the damage. Therefore it is important to study the genes involved in various repair pathways in the plants in greater detail. UvrD helicase is a component of MMR complex and plays an essential role in the DNA repair by providing the unwinding function. In the present manuscript we present an in silico analysis of UvrD helicase from two plant species (Arabidopsis and rice). The Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa UvrD are 1149 (~129 kDa) and 1165 amino-acids (~130 kDa) proteins, respectively. These proteins contain all the conserved domains and are larger than the E. coli UvrD because they contain a longer N-terminal extension. In order to decipher the role of plant UvrD in various stresses it will be important to study the biochemical and functional properties of this enzyme.
23971515	Comparative proteomics analysis of the rice roots colonized by Herbaspirillum seropedicae strain SmR1 reveals induction of the methionine recycling in the plant host.	2013	J Proteome Res	Although the use of plant growth-promoting bacteria in agriculture is a reality, the molecular basis of plant-bacterial interaction is still poorly understood. We used a proteomic approach to study the mechanisms of interaction of Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 with rice. Root proteins of rice seedlings inoculated or noninoculated with H. seropedicae were separated by 2-D electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF and MASCOT program. Among the identified proteins of H. seropedicae, the dinitrogenase reductase NifH and glutamine synthetase GlnA, which participate in nitrogen fixation and ammonium assimilation, respectively, were the most abundant. The rice proteins up-regulated included the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, methylthioribose kinase, and acireductone dioxygenase 1, all of which are involved in the methionine recycling. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, an intermediate used in transmethylation reactions and in ethylene, polyamine, and phytosiderophore biosynthesis. RT-qPCR analysis also confirmed that the methionine recycling and phytosiderophore biosynthesis genes were up-regulated, while ACC oxidase mRNA level was down-regulated in rice roots colonized by bacteria. In agreement with these results, ethylene production was reduced approximately three-fold in rice roots colonized by H. seropedicae. The results suggest that H. seropedicae stimulates methionine recycling and phytosiderophore synthesis and diminishes ethylene synthesis in rice roots.
23973431	Knockout of vascular early response gene worsens chronic stroke outcomes in neonatal mice.	2013	Brain Res Bull	Vascular early response gene (Verge) is a novel immediate early gene that is highly expressed during developmental angiogenesis and after ischemic insults in adult brain. However, the role of Verge after neonatal injury is not known. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that Verge contributes to vascular remodeling and tissue repair after neonatal ischemic injury. The Rice-Vanucci model (RVM) was employed to induce neonatal stroke in both Verge knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) postnatal day 10 (P10) mice. Histological and behavioral outcomes at acute (24h), subacute (7 days) and chronic (30 days) phases were evaluated. Angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and glial scar formation were also examined in the ischemic brain. No significant differences in outcomes were found between WT and Verge mice at 24h or 7 days after stroke. However genetic deletion of Verge led to pronounced cystic cavitation, decreased angiogenensis and glial scar formation in the ischemic hemisphere compared to WT mice at 30 days. Verge KO mice also had significantly worse functional outcomes at 30 days which was accompanied by decreased neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the ischemic hemisphere. Our study suggests that Verge plays an important role in the induction of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after ischemia, contributes to improved tissue repair, and enhances chronic functional recovery.
23952103	Natural variation and artificial selection in four genes determine grain shape in rice.	2013	New Phytol	The size of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) grains has been altered by both domestication and artificial selection over the course of evolutionary history. Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain size have been cloned in the past 10 yr. To explore the natural variation in these QTLs, resequencing of grain width and weight 2 (GW2), grain size 5 (GS5) and QTL for seed width 5 (qSW5) and genotyping of grain size 3 (GS3) were performed in the germplasms of 127 varieties of rice (O. sativa) and 10-15 samples of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon). Ten, 10 and 15 haplotypes were observed for GW2, GS5 and qSW5. qSW5 and GS3 had the strongest effects on grain size, which have been widely utilized in rice production, whereas GW2 and GS5 showed more modest effects. GS5 showed small sequence variations in O. sativa germplasm and that of its progenitor O. rufipogon. qSW5 exhibited the highest level of nucleotide diversity. GW2 showed signs of purifying selection. The four grain size genes experienced different selection intensities depending on their genetic effects. In the indica population, linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected among GS3, qSW5 and GS5. The substantial genetic variation in these four genes provides the flexibility needed to design various rice grain shapes. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary features of grain size genes in rice.
23905647	A novel 5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase transgene for glyphosate resistance stimulates growth and fecundity in weedy rice (Oryza sativa) without herbicide.	2014	New Phytol	Understanding evolutionary interactions among crops and weeds can facilitate effective weed management. For example, gene flow from crops to their wild or weedy relatives can lead to rapid evolution in recipient populations. In rice (Oryza sativa), transgenic herbicide resistance is expected to spread to conspecific weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) via hybridization. Here, we studied fitness effects of transgenic over-expression of a native 5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (epsps) gene developed to confer glyphosate resistance in rice. Controlling for genetic background, we examined physiological traits and field performance of crop-weed hybrid lineages that segregated for the presence or absence of this novel epsps transgene. Surprisingly, we found that transgenic F2 crop-weed hybrids produced 48-125% more seeds per plant than nontransgenic controls in monoculture- and mixed-planting designs without glyphosate application. Transgenic plants also had greater EPSPS protein levels, tryptophan concentrations, photosynthetic rates, and per cent seed germination compared with nontransgenic controls. Our findings suggest that over-expression of a native rice epsps gene can lead to fitness advantages, even without exposure to glyphosate. We hypothesize that over-expressed epsps may be useful to breeders and, if deployed, could result in fitness benefits in weedy relatives following transgene introgression.
23977227	The nitrate transporter (NRT) gene family in poplar.	2013	PLoS One	Nitrate is an important nutrient required for plant growth. It also acts as a signal regulating plant development. Nitrate is actively taken up and transported by nitrate transporters (NRT), which form a large family with many members and distinct functions. In contrast to Arabidopsis and rice there is little information about the NRT family in woody plants such as Populus. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the Populus NRT family was performed. Sixty-eight PtNRT1/PTR, 6 PtNRT2, and 5 PtNRT3 genes were identified in the P. trichocarpa genome. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the genes of the NRT family are divided into three clades: NRT1/PTR with four subclades, NRT2, and NRT3. Topological analysis indicated that all members of PtNRT1/PTR and PtNRT2 have 8 to 12 trans-membrane domains, whereas the PtNRT3 proteins have no or up to two trans-membrane domains. Four PtNRT3 members were predicted as secreted proteins. Microarray analyses revealed tissue-specific expression patterns of PtNRT genes with distinct clusters of NRTs for roots, for the elongation zone of the apical stem segment and the developing xylem and a further cluster for leaves, bark and wood. A comparison of different poplar species (P. trichocarpa, P. tremula, P. euphratica, P. fremontii x P. angustifolia, and P. x canescens) showed that the tissue-specific patterns of the NRT genes varied to some extent with species. Bioinformatic analysis of putative cis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions of PtNRT family retrieved motifs suggesting the regulation of the NRT genes by N metabolism, by energy and carbon metabolism, and by phytohormones and stress. Multivariate analysis suggested that the combination and abundance of motifs in distinct promoters may lead to tissue-specificity. Our genome wide analysis of the PtNRT genes provides a valuable basis for functional analysis towards understanding the role of nitrate transporters for tree growth.
23917116	Anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Inonotus obliquus and germinated brown rice extracts.	2013	Molecules	Inonotus obliquus (IO) is parasitic mushroom that grows on birch and other trees in Russia, Korea, Europe and United States. However, IO is not readily available for consumption due to its high cost and difficult growth. In this regard, IO was inoculated on germinated brown rice (GBR) in the present study and the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the IO grown on germinated brown rice (IOGBR) extracts were evaluated extensively and compared with those for IO and GBR. IOGBR showed highest antioxidant activities with scavenging total intracellular ROS and MDA levels as well as increasing the antioxidant enzymes activity in the H₂O₂-stimulated mice liver. It also exhibited best inflammatory activities by suppressing the proinflammatory mediators such as NO, PGE₂, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in an LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell line. This study provides a comparative approach to find out an excellent natural source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agent as a dietary supplement.
23935502	The late endosomal HOPS complex anchors active G-protein signaling essential for pathogenesis in magnaporthe oryzae.	2013	PLoS Pathog	In Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal ascomycete of the devastating rice blast disease, the conidial germ tube tip must sense and respond to a wide array of requisite cues from the host in order to switch from polarized to isotropic growth, ultimately forming the dome-shaped infection cell known as the appressorium. Although the role for G-protein mediated Cyclic AMP signaling in appressorium formation was first identified almost two decades ago, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cascade and how the signal is transmitted through the intracellular network during cell growth and morphogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the late endosomal compartments, comprising of a PI3P-rich (Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular network, scaffold active MagA/GαS, Rgs1 (a GAP for MagA), Adenylate cyclase and Pth11 (a non-canonical GPCR) in the likely absence of AKAP-like anchors during early pathogenic development in M. oryzae. Loss of HOPS component Vps39 and consequently the late endosomal function caused a disruption of adenylate cyclase localization, cAMP signaling and appressorium formation. Remarkably, exogenous cAMP rescued the appressorium formation defects associated with VPS39 deletion in M. oryzae. We propose that sequestration of key G-protein signaling components on dynamic late endosomes and/or endolysosomes, provides an effective molecular means to compartmentalize and control the spatio-temporal activation and rapid downregulation (likely via vacuolar degradation) of cAMP signaling amidst changing cellular geometry during pathogenic development in M. oryzae.
23943138	Characterization of photosystem I in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings upon exposure to random positioning machine.	2013	Photosynth Res	To gain a better understanding of how photosynthesis is adapted under altered gravity forces, photosynthetic apparatus and its functioning were investigated in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings grown in a random positioning machine (RPM). A decrease in fresh weight and dry weight was observed in rice seedlings grown under RPM condition. No significant changes were found in the chloroplast ultrastructure and total chlorophyll content between the RPM and control samples. Analyses of chlorophyll fluorescence and thermoluminescence demonstrate that PSII activity was unchanged under RPM condition. However, PSI activity decreased significantly under RPM condition. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra show a blue-shift and reduction of PSI fluorescence emission peak in the RPM seedlings. In addition, RPM caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of absorbance changes of P700 at 820 nm (A 820) induced by saturated far-red light. Moreover, the PSI efficiency (Φ I) decreased significantly under RPM condition. Immunoblot and blue native gel analyses further illustrate that accumulation of PSI proteins was greatly decreased in the RPM seedlings. Our results suggest that PSI, but not PSII, is down-regulated under RPM condition.
23759099	Analysis of the cell death-inducing ability of the ethylene response factors in group VIII of the AP2/ERF family.	2013	Plant Sci	The ethylene response factor (ERF) family is one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors. We have shown previously that the overexpression of the gene for NtERF3, a tobacco transcriptional repressor containing the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif in the C-terminal region, induces hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death. Many EAR motif-containing ERFs, including NtERF3, are clustered in group VIII of the ERF family. In this study, we aimed at revealing the cell death-inducing ability of group VIII ERFs and the correlation between ERFs and HR. The results showed that many of the EAR motif-containing ERFs classified into subgroup VIII-a of Arabidopsis, rice, and tobacco had cell death-inducing ability in tobacco leaves. Seven AtERFs in subgroup VIII-b did not induce cell death; however, some ERFs in subgroup VIII-b of rice and tobacco showed cell death-inducing ability. An expression analysis of group VIII ERFs in HR-inducing tobacco suggested that the cell death-inducing ability of NtERFs was not necessarily associated with induction of HR. In addition, it was revealed that the EAR motif-containing AtERFs in subgroup II-a also showed cell death-inducing ability. The influence of sequence variation in the EAR motif on the ability to induce cell death is also discussed.
23951075	Molecular hydrogen is involved in phytohormone signaling and stress responses in plants.	2013	PLoS One	Molecular hydrogen (H2) metabolism in bacteria and algae has been well studied from an industrial perspective because H2 is viewed as a potential future energy source. A number of clinical trials have recently reported that H2 is a therapeutic antioxidant and signaling molecule. Although H2 metabolism in higher plants was reported in some early studies, its biological effects remain unclear. In this report, the biological effects of H2 and its involvement in plant hormone signaling pathways and stress responses were determined. Antioxidant enzyme activity was found to be increased and the transcription of corresponding genes altered when the effects of H2 on the germination of mung bean seeds treated with phytohormones was investigated. In addition, upregulation of several phytohormone receptor genes and genes that encode a few key factors involved in plant signaling pathways was detected in rice seedlings treated with HW. The transcription of putative rice hydrogenase genes, hydrogenase activity, and endogenous H2 production were also determined. H2 production was found to be induced by abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonate acid, salt, and drought stress and was consistent with hydrogenase activity and the expression of putative hydrogenase genes in rice seedlings. Together, these results suggest that H2 may have an effect on rice stress tolerance by modulating the output of hormone signaling pathways.
23956243	A whole-genome analysis of a transgenic rice seed-based edible vaccine against cedar pollen allergy.	2013	DNA Res	Genetic modification (GM) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a robust and widely employed method to confer new traits to crops. In this process, a transfer DNA is delivered into the host genome, but it is still unclear how the host genome is altered by this event at single-base resolution. To decipher genomic discrepancy between GM crops and their host, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of a transgenic rice line OSCR11. This rice line expresses a seed-based edible vaccine containing two major pollen allergens, Cry j 1 and Cry j 2, against Japanese cedar pollinosis. We revealed that genetic differences between OSCR11 and its host a123 were significantly less than those between a123 and its precedent cultivar Koshihikari. The pattern of nucleotide base substitution in OSCR11, relative to a123, was consistent with somaclonal variation. Mutations in OSCR11 probably occurred during the cell culture steps. In addition, strand-specific mRNA-Seq revealed similar transcriptomes of a123 and OSCR11, supporting genomic integrity between them.
23965250	Isolation of alpaca anti-idiotypic heavy-chain single-domain antibody for the aflatoxin immunoassay.	2013	Anal Chem	Anti-idiotypic antibodies recognize the antigenic determinants of an antibody, thus they can be used as surrogate antigens. Single-domain antibodies from camlid heavy-chain antibodies with the benefit features of small size, thermostability, and ease in expression, are leading candidates to produce anti-idiotypic antibodies. In this work, we constructed an antibody phage library from the mRNA of an alpaca immunized with an antiaflatoxin monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1C11. Three anti-idiotypic VHH antibodies were isolated and applied to immunoassay toward aflatoxin as a coating antigen. The best immunoassay developed with one of these VHH antibodies shows an IC50 of 0.16 ng/mL toward aflatoxin B1 and cross-reactivity toward aflatoxin B2, G1, and G2 of 90.4%, 54.4%, and 37.7%, respectively. The VHH-based immunoassay was successfully applied to the analysis of peanuts, corn, and rice, which are the predominant commodities regularly contaminated by aflatoxins. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.89) was found between the data obtained from the conventional ELISA and the ELISA based on a VHH coating antigen for the analysis of aflatoxins in peanuts and feedstuff. The use of biotechnology in developing the surrogate, the absence of standard aflatoxin and organic solvents in the synthesis procedures, and the reproducibility of the VHH antibody makes it an ideal strategy for replacing conventional synthesized antigens.
23975886	Accumulation of nitrate and nitrite in chilled leaves of rice seedlings is induced by high root temperature.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	We previously found a novel type of chilling injury in the leaves of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cv. Akitakomachi). The damage was only observed when the roots were not chilled (10 °C/25 °C, shoots/roots), but not when the whole seedling was chilled (10 °C/10 °C). In this report, we show that the chilling injury induced by high root temperature required nitrate and potassium together with a trace amount of iron, manganese or both in the nutrient solution during the treatment, and that the injury was increased by nitrogen starvation before chilling. Both nitrate and nitrite accumulated in the 10 °C/25 °C leaves when the nutrient solution contained nitrate. The nitrate accumulation in the 10 °C/25 °C leaves was highest at the end of the first light period, and was followed by a decrease with a concomitant increase in nitrite during the first dark period. The photosynthetic electron transport was completely lost in both PSII and PSI in the 10 °C/25 °C leaves when the nutrient solution contained nitrate. However, the activities in the leaves of the 10 °C/25 °C plants treated with the nutrient solution lacking nitrate remained at approximately half those in the 10 °C/10°C leaves. The photochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence and the P700 oxidation state were also intermediate between those in the 10 °C/25 °C and 10 °C/10°C leaves of plants supplied with the complete nutrients. Thus, the chilling injury was closely linked to the accumulation of nitrate and nitrite, as well as to a malfunction of photosynthesis in the 10 °C/25 °C leaves.
23973864	Antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic α-helical octadecapeptide derived from heat shock protein 70 of rice.	2013	Peptides	Hsp70(241-258), an octadecapeptide derived from the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) of rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica), is a novel cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that contains four lysine, two arginine, and two histidine residues. The antimicrobial activity of Hsp70(241-258) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, and Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, was quantitatively evaluated using a chemiluminescence method that measures ATP derived from viable cells. The 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations of Hsp70(241-258) against P. gingivalis and C. albicans cells were 63 μM and 70 μM, respectively. Hsp70(241-258) had little or no hemolytic activity even at 1mM, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 300 μM. The degrees of calcein leakage from large unilamellar vesicles, which mimic the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from P. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of Hsp70(241-258) increased in a concentration-dependent manner. When Hsp70(241-258) was added to calcein-acetoxymethyl ester-loaded C. albicans cells, calcein release from the cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis also showed that the percentages of C. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide, a DNA-intercalating dye, increased as the concentration of Hsp70(241-258) added was increased. Therefore, Hsp70(241-258) appears to exhibit antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis and C. albicans through membrane disruption. These results suggest that Hsp70(241-258) could be useful as a safe and potent AMP against P. gingivalis and C. albicans in many fields of health care, especially in the control of oral infections.
23982951	Effect of substituting arginine and lysine with alanine on antimicrobial activity and the mechanism of action of a cationic dodecapeptide (CL(14-25)), a partial sequence of cyanate lyase from rice.	2014	Biopolymers	The antimicrobial activity of analogs obtained by substituting arginine and lysine in CL(14-25), a cationic α-helical dodecapeptide, with alanine against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, varied significantly depending on the number and position of cationic amino acids. The alanine-substituted analogs had no hemolytic activity, even at a concentration of 1 mM. The antimicrobial activities of CL(K20A) and CL(K20A, K25A) were 3.8-fold and 9.1-fold higher, respectively, than that of CL(14-25). The antimicrobial activity of CL(R15A) was slightly lower than that of CL(14-25), suggesting that arginine at position 15 is not essential but is important for the antimicrobial activity. The experiments in which the alanine-substituted analogs bearing the replacement of arginine at position 24 and/or lysine at position 25 were used showed that arginine at position 24 was crucial for the antimicrobial activity whenever lysine at position 25 was substituted with alanine. Helical wheel projections of the alanine-substituted analogs indicate that the hydrophobicity in the vicinity of leucine at position 16 and alanines at positions 18 and/or 21 increased by substituting lysine at positions 20 and 25 with alanine, respectively. The degrees of diSC3 -5 release from P. gingivalis cells and disruption of GUVs induced by the alanine-substituted analogs with different positive charges were not closely related to their antimicrobial activities. The enhanced antimicrobial activities of the alanine-substituted analogs appear to be mainly attributable to the changes in properties such as hydrophobicity and amphipathic propensity due to alanine substitution and not to their extents of positive charge (cationicity).
23951288	A comparative genome analysis of PME and PMEI families reveals the evolution of pectin metabolism in plant cell walls.	2013	PLoS One	Pectins are fundamental polysaccharides in the plant primary cell wall. Pectins are synthesized and secreted to cell walls as highly methyl-esterified polymers and then demethyl-esterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which are spatially regulated by pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs). Although PME and PMEI genes are pivotal in plant cell wall formation, few studies have focused on the evolutionary patterns of the PME and PMEI gene families. In this study, the gene origin, evolution, and expression diversity of these two families were systematically analyzed using 11 representative species, including algae, bryophytes, lycophytes and flowering land plants. The results show that 1) for the two subfamilies (PME and proPME) of PME, the origin of the PME subfamily is consistent with the appearance of pectins in early charophyte cell walls, 2) Whole genome duplication (WGD) and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of proPME and PMEI families in land plants, 3) Evidence of selection pressure shows that the proPME and PMEI families have rapidly evolved, particularly the PMEI family in vascular plants, and 4) Comparative expression profile analysis of the two families indicates that the eudicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice have different expression patterns. In addition, the gene structure and sequence analyses show that the origin of the PMEI domain may be derived from the neofunctionalization of the pro domain after WGD. This study will advance the evolutionary understanding of the PME and PMEI families and plant cell wall development.
23926950	Constitutive expression of cell wall invertase genes increases grain yield and starch content in maize.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Grain size, number and starch content are important determinants of grain yield and quality. One of the most important biological processes that determine these components is the carbon partitioning during the early grain filling, which requires the function of cell wall invertase. Here, we showed the constitutive expression of cell wall invertase-encoding gene from Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa) or maize (Zea mays), driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, all increased cell wall invertase activities in different tissues and organs, including leaves and developing seeds, and substantially improved grain yield up to 145.3% in transgenic maize plants as compared to the wild-type plants, an effect that was reproduced in our 2-year field trials at different locations. The dramatically increased grain yield is due to the enlarged ears with both enhanced grain size and grain number. Constitutive expression of the invertase-encoding gene also increased total starch content up to 20% in the transgenic kernels. Our results suggest that cell wall invertase gene can be genetically engineered to improve both grain yield and grain quality in crop plants.
23986771	Construction of a rice glycoside hydrolase phylogenomic database and identification of targets for biofuel research.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Glycoside hydrolases (GH) catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in cell wall polymers and can have major effects on cell wall architecture. Taking advantage of the massive datasets available in public databases, we have constructed a rice phylogenomic database of GHs (http://ricephylogenomics.ucdavis.edu/cellwalls/gh/). This database integrates multiple data types including the structural features, orthologous relationships, mutant availability, and gene expression patterns for each GH family in a phylogenomic context. The rice genome encodes 437 GH genes classified into 34 families. Based on pairwise comparison with eight dicot and four monocot genomes, we identified 138 GH genes that are highly diverged between monocots and dicots, 57 of which have diverged further in rice as compared with four monocot genomes scanned in this study. Chromosomal localization and expression analysis suggest a role for both whole-genome and localized gene duplications in expansion and diversification of GH families in rice. We examined the meta-profiles of expression patterns of GH genes in twenty different anatomical tissues of rice. Transcripts of 51 genes exhibit tissue or developmental stage-preferential expression, whereas, seventeen other genes preferentially accumulate in actively growing tissues. When queried in RiceNet, a probabilistic functional gene network that facilitates functional gene predictions, nine out of seventeen genes form a regulatory network with the well-characterized genes involved in biosynthesis of cell wall polymers including cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes of rice. Two-thirds of the GH genes in rice are up regulated in response to biotic and abiotic stress treatments indicating a role in stress adaptation. Our analyses identify potential GH targets for cell wall modification.
23963074	An engineered multidomain fungicidal peptide against plant fungal pathogens.	2013	Sheng Li Xue Bao	Fungal pathogens represent major problems for human health and agriculture. As eukaryotic organisms, fungi share some important features with mammalian cells. Therefore, current anti-fungal antibiotics often can not distinguish between fungi and mammalian cells, resulting in serious side effects in mammalian cells. Accordingly, there is strong impetus to develop antifungal alternatives that are both safe and effective. The E1 family of colicin are channel-forming bacteriocins produced by Escherichia coli, which are bactericidal only to E. coli and related species. To target the channel-forming domain of colicin to fungal cell membrane, we engineered a sexual mating pheromone of Candida albicans, α-factor pheromone to colicin Ia. A peptide was constructed consisting of an α mating pheromone of C. albicans fused to the channel-forming domain of colicin Ia to create a new fusion protein, pheromonicin-CA (PMC-CA). Indirect immunolabeling showed that the PMC-CA bound to fungal cells and inhibited growth in the laboratory and field. In the field, the protective activity of pheromonicin against rice blast disease was significantly greater, on a molar basis, than that of triazoles, tricyclazole or isoprothiolane. These results suggest that fusion peptides may be of value as fungicidal agents under agricultural conditions.
23925294	Rice-based oral antibody fragment prophylaxis and therapy against rotavirus infection.	2013	J Clin Invest	Rotavirus-induced diarrhea is a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals and in children in developing countries. We have developed a system for prophylaxis and therapy against rotavirus disease using transgenic rice expressing the neutralizing variable domain of a rotavirus-specific llama heavy-chain antibody fragment (MucoRice-ARP1). MucoRice-ARP1 was produced at high levels in rice seeds using an overexpression system and RNAi technology to suppress the production of major rice endogenous storage proteins. Orally administered MucoRice-ARP1 markedly decreased the viral load in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. The antibody retained in vitro neutralizing activity after long-term storage (>1 yr) and boiling and conferred protection in mice even after heat treatment at 94°C for 30 minutes. High-yield, water-soluble, and purification-free MucoRice-ARP1 thus forms the basis for orally administered prophylaxis and therapy against rotavirus infections.

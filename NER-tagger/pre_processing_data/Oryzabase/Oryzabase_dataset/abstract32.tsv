11909851	Catalytic properties of rice alpha-oxygenase. A comparison with mammalian prostaglandin H synthases.	2002	J Biol Chem	Long-chain fatty acids can be metabolized to C(n)(-1) aldehydes by alpha-oxidation in plants. The reaction mechanism of the enzyme has not been elucidated. In this study, a complete nucleotide sequence of fatty acid alpha-oxygenase gene in rice plants (Oryza sativa) was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence showed some similarity with those of mammalian prostaglandin H synthases (PGHSs). The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparently homogeneous state. It showed the highest activity with linoleic acid and predominantly formed 2-hydroperoxide of the fatty acid (C(n)), which is then spontaneously decarboxylated to form corresponding C(n)(-1) aldehyde. With linoleic or linoleic acids as a substrate, rice alpha-oxygenase formed no product having a lambda(max) at approximately 234 nm, which indicated that the enzyme could not oxygenize the pentadiene system in the substrate. The spectroscopic feature of the purified enzyme in its ferrous state is similar to that of mammalian PGHS, whereas that of dithionite-reduced state showed significant difference. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that His-158, Tyr-380, and Ser-558 were essential for the alpha-oxygenase activity. These residues are conserved in PGHS and known as a heme ligand, a source of a radical species to initiate oxygenation reaction and a residue involved in substrate binding, respectively. This finding suggested that the initial step of the oxygenation reaction in alpha-oxygenase has a high similarity with that of PGHS. The rice alpha-oxygenase activity was inhibited by imidazole but hardly inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and flurbiprofen, which are known as typical PGHS inhibitors. In addition, peroxidase activity could not be detected with alpha-oxygenase when palmitic acid 2-hydroperoxide was used as a substrate. From these findings, the catalytic resemblance between alpha-oxygenase and PGHS seems to be evident, although there still are differences in their substrate recognitions and peroxidation activities.
16582486	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of pathogen-inducible oxygenase (PIOX) from Oryza sativa.	2006	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Pathogen-inducible oxygenase (PIOX) is a heme-containing membrane-associated protein found in monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants that utilizes molecular oxygen to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids into their corresponding 2R-hydroperoxides. PIOX is a member of a larger family of fatty-acid alpha-dioxygenases that includes the mammalian cyclooxygenase enzymes cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). Single crystals of PIOX from rice (Oryza sativa) have been grown from MPD using recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently extracted utilizing decyl maltoside as the solubilizing detergent. Crystals diffract to 3.0 angstroms resolution using a rotating-anode generator and R-AXIS IV detector, and belong to space group P1. Based on the Matthews coefficient and self-rotation function analyses, there are presumed to be four molecules in the asymmetric unit related by noncrystallographic 222 symmetry.
15069599	Marker-assisted selection in segregating generations of self-fertilizing crops.	2004	Theor Appl Genet	Computer simulations were used to study the efficiency of MAS for breeding self-fertilizing crops, based on a general model including additive, dominance and epistasis. It was shown that MAS not only gave larger genetic responses but also dramatically increased the frequencies of superior genotypes as compared with phenotypic selection. However, the advantages of MAS over phenotypic selection were considerably reduced when conducting selection in later generations. A modified method combining MAS in early generations with phenotypic selection in later generations was thus proposed from an efficiency standpoint. We also proposed a potential index to measure the probability of an individual showing superior genotypes under selfing. It was apparent that more superior genotypes could be derived from selection by using the potential index than by using other methods. The implications of these findings for plant breeding are discussed.
19756234	Structural characterization and expression analysis of the SERK/SERL gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).	2009	Int J Plant Genomics	Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the developmental restructuring of somatic cells towards the embryogenic pathway and forms the basis of cellular totipotency in angiosperms. With the availability of full-length cDNA sequences from Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encylopedia (KOME), we identified the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) genes from rice (Oryza sativa), which also encompasses genes involved in regulating somatic embryogenesis. Eight out of eleven of the rice SERK and SERL (SERK-like) genes have the TIGR annotation as (putative) brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase (precursor). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was undertaken to quantify transcript levels of these 11 genes. Most of these genes were upregulated by brassinosteroids although only a few of these displayed auxin induction. The expression profile of these genes is nearly uniform in the zygotic embryogenic tissue, but the expression pattern is more complex in the somatic embryogenic tissue. It is likely that OsSERKs and OsSERLs may be involved in somatic embryogenesis and also perform a role in morphogenesis and various other plant developmental processes. Functional validation of these somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase genes may help in elucidating their precise functions in regulating various facets of plant development.
19754838	Engineering OsBAK1 gene as a molecular tool to improve rice architecture for high yield.	2009	Plant Biotechnol J	Generating a new variety of plant with erect-leaf is a critical strategy to improve rice grain yield, as plants with this trait can be dense-planted. The erect-leaf is a significant morphological trait partially regulated by Brassinosteroids (BRs) in rice plants. So far, only a few genes can be used for molecular breeding in rice. Here, we identified OsBAK1 as a potential gene to alter rice architecture. Based on rice genome sequences, four closely related homologs of Arabidopsis BAK1 (AtBAK1) gene were amplified. Phylogenetic analysis and suppression of a weak Arabidopsis mutant bri1-5 indicated that OsBAK1 (Os08g0174700) is the closest relative of AtBAK1. Genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses all suggest that the function of OsBAK1 is conserved with AtBAK1. Overexpression of a truncated intracellular domain of OsBAK1, but not the extracellular domain of OsBAK1, resulted in a dwarfed phenotype, similar to the rice BR-insensitive mutant plants. The expression of OsBAK1 changed important agricultural traits of rice such as plant height, leaf erectness, grain morphologic features, and disease resistance responses. Our results suggested that a new rice variety with erect-leaf and normal reproduction can be generated simply by suppressing the expression level of OsBAK1. Therefore, OsBAK1 is a potential molecular breeding tool for improving rice grain yield by modifying rice architecture.
20128878	Rice metal-nicotianamine transporter, OsYSL2, is required for the long-distance transport of iron and manganese.	2010	Plant J	Rice (Oryza sativa) is indispensable in the diet of most of the world's population. Thus, it is an important target in which to alter iron (Fe) uptake and homeostasis, so as to increase Fe accumulation in the grain. We previously isolated OsYSL2, a functional iron [Fe(II)]- and manganese [Mn(II)]-nicotianamine complex transporter that is expressed in phloem cells and developing seeds. We produced RNAi (OsYSL2i) and overexpression lines (OXOsYSL2) of OsYSL2. At the vegetative stage in an OsYSL2i line, the Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the shoots, and the Fe concentration was increased in the roots. At the reproductive stage, positron-emitting tracer imaging system analysis revealed that Fe translocation to the shoots and seeds was suppressed in OsYSL2i. The Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the seeds of OsYSL2i, especially in the endosperm. Moreover, the Fe concentration in OXOsYSL2 was lower in the seeds and shoots, but higher in the roots, compared with the wild type. Furthermore, when OsYSL2 expression was driven by the sucrose transporter promoter, the Fe concentration in the polished rice was up to 4.4-fold higher compared with the wild type. These results indicate that the altered expression of OsYSL2 changes the localization of Fe, and that OsYSL2 is a critical Fe-nicotianamine transporter important for Fe translocation, especially in the shoots and endosperm.
21047815	Characterization of a novel rice kinesin O12 with a calponin homology domain.	2011	J Biochem	Genomic analysis predicted that the rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica) genome encodes at least 41 kinesin-like proteins including the novel kinesin O12, which is classified as a kinesin-14 family member. O12 has a calponin homology (CH) domain that is known as an actin-binding domain. In this study, we expressed the functional domains of O12 in Escherichia coli and determined its enzymatic characteristics compared with other kinesins. The microtubule-dependent ATPase activity of recombinant O12 containing the motor and CH domains was significantly reduced in the presence of actin. Interestingly, microtubule-dependent ATPase activity of the motor domain was also affected by actin in the absence of the CH domain. Our findings suggest that the motor activity of the rice plant-specific kinesin O12 may be regulated by actin.
11448759	Synthesis of hemoglobins in rice (Oryza sativa var. Jackson) plants growing in normal and stress conditions.	2001	Plant Sci	In rice (Oryza sativa var. Jackson) at least three copies of hemoglobin (hb) gene exist. Rice hb1 and hb2 genes are differentially expressed in roots and leaves from mature plants. We used polyclonal antibodies raised to recombinant rice Hb1 and Western blotting to analyze the synthesis of Hbs in rice plants growing under normal or stress conditions. Results showed that rice Hbs are synthesized in coleoptiles, seminal roots and embryos from seeds germinated for 6 days, and also in leaves and roots from plants 2-14 weeks after germination. Analysis of Hb synthesis in stressed rice showed that: (i) level of Hbs was higher in etiolated than control plants, (ii) level of Hbs increased in roots from flooded rice, and (iii) level of Hbs did not change under oxidative (H(2)O(2)), nitrosative (SNP) and hormonal (2,4-D) stresses. These results suggest that the effect of light withdrawal in etiolated leaves and O(2)-limiting conditions in flooded roots, but not oxidative, nitrosative and hormonal stresses, modulate the synthesis of rice Hbs.
20376671	Characterization and fine mapping of the glabrous leaf and hull mutants (gl1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2010	Plant Cell Rep	The glabrous leaf and hull (gl1) mutants were isolated from M(2) generation of indica cultivar 93-11. These mutants produced smooth leaves and hairless glumes under normal growth conditions. By analyzing through scanning electron microscope, it was revealed that the leaf trichomes, including macro and micro hairs, were deficient in these mutants. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using nine SSR markers and one InDel marker, the gl1 gene was mapped between RM1200 and RM2010 at the short arm of chromosome 5, which was consistent with the mapping of gl1 in previous studies. To facilitate the map-based cloning of the gl1 gene, 12 new InDel markers were developed. A high-resolution genetic and physical map was constructed by using 1,396 mutant individuals of F(2) mapping population. Finally, the gl1 was fine mapped in 54-kb region containing 10 annotated genes. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from four gl1 mutants (gl1-1, gl1-2, gl1-3 and gl1-4) and four glabrous rice varieties (Jackson, Jefferson, Katy and Lemont) all showed that the same single point mutation (A-->T) occurred in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the locus Os05g0118900 (corresponding to the 3'-UTR of STAR2). RT-PCR analysis of the locus Os05g0118900 revealed that its mRNA expression level was normal in gl1 mutant. RNA secondary structure prediction showed that the single point mutation resulted in a striking RNA conformational change. These results suggest that the single point mutation is most likely responsible for the glabrous leaf and hull phenotypes in rice.
20490919	Analysis of the Wsi18, a stress-inducible promoter that is active in the whole grain of transgenic rice.	2011	Transgenic Res	There is currently a shortage of efficient promoters for stress-inducible gene expression, especially in monocotyledonous crops. Here, we report analysis of the rice Wsi18 promoter, a member of the group 3 Lea family, in transgenic rice plants. The abundance of Wsi18 mRNA increased in leaf tissues within 2 h of exposure to NaCl or abscisic acid (ABA) and within 6 h of exposure to drought, but there was no transcript increase in response to low-temperature conditions. Wsi18 mRNA accumulated in the roots similarly to in the leaves, but at a faster rate. The promoter was linked to the GFP reporter gene, transformed into rice, and its activity was analyzed in transgenic plants at all stages of plant growth from calli, vegetative tissues, flowers, and to dry seeds, both before and after stress treatment. The activity of the promoter was significantly increased in the whole plant body, including flowers, on exposure of plants to stress conditions, with very low levels of basal activity in all tissues. Moreover, the promoter was found to be predominantly active in the whole grain, including endosperm, embryo, and aleurone layer during seed development. Together, we have identified and analyzed the Wsi18 promoter and found a previously undescribed characteristic-a stress-inducible property in the whole plant body with activity in the whole grain during seed development.
23741473	Rice OsGL1-6 is involved in leaf cuticular wax accumulation and drought resistance.	2013	PLoS One	Cuticular wax is a class of organic compounds that comprises the outermost layer of plant surfaces. Plant cuticular wax, the last barrier of self-defense, plays an important role in plant growth and development. The OsGL1-6 gene, a member of the fatty aldehyde decarbonylase gene family, is highly homologous to Arabidopsis CER1, which is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. However, whether OsGL1-6 participates in cuticular wax biosynthesis remains unknown. In this study, an OsGL1-6 antisense-RNA vector driven by its own promoter was constructed and introduced into the rice variety Zhonghua11 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to obtain several independent transgenic plants with decreased OsGL1-6 expression. These OsGL1-6 antisense-RNA transgenic plants showed droopy leaves at the booting stage, significantly decreased leaf cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticle membrane, increased chlorophyll leaching and water loss rates, and enhanced drought sensitivity. The OsGL1-6 gene was constitutively expressed in all examined organs and was very highly expressed in leaf epidermal cells and vascular bundles. The transient expression of OsGL1-6-GFP fusion indicated that OsGL1-6 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the wax composition using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a significantly reduced total cuticular wax load on the leaf blades of the OsGL1-6 antisense-RNA transgenic plants as well as markedly decreased alkane and aldehyde contents. Their primary alcohol contents increased significantly compared with those in the wild type plants, suggesting that OsGL1-6 is associated with the decarbonylation pathways in wax biosynthesis. We propose that OsGL1-6 is involved in the accumulation of leaf cuticular wax and directly impacts drought resistance in rice.
10707360	Syringolin-mediated activation of the Pir7b esterase gene in rice cells is suppressed by phosphatase inhibitors.	2000	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Inoculation of rice plants (Oryza sativa) with the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae leads to the activation of defense-related genes and ultimately to induced resistance against the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. One of the molecular determinants of P. syringae pv. syringae that is recognized by the plant cells and evokes these defense responses is syringolin A, an elicitor that is secreted by the bacteria under appropriate conditions. In order to investigate signal transduction events elicited by syringolin A, the response of cultured rice cells to syringolin A application was analyzed. Cultured rice cells were able to sense syringolin A at concentrations in the nanomolar range as observed by the transient accumulation of Pir7b esterase transcripts. Syringolin A-mediated Pir7b transcript accumulation was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was required. Calyculin and okadaic acid, two protein phosphatase inhibitors, blocked Pir7b gene induction, whereas the serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and K-252a had no effect on Pir7b transcript levels. Actin transcript levels were essentially not affected by inhibitor treatments over the experimental time span. These results imply that dephosphorylation of a phosphoprotein is an important step in the syringolin A-triggered signal transduction pathway.
16506311	Organization and function of the plant pleiotropic drug resistance ABC transporter family.	2006	FEBS Lett	Among the ABC transporters, the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family is particular in that its members are found only in fungi and plants and have a reverse domain organization, i.e., the nucleotide binding domain precedes the transmembrane domain. In Arabidopsis and rice, for which the full genome has been sequenced, the family of plant ABC transporters contains 15 and 23 PDR genes, respectively, which can be tentatively organized using the sequence data into five subfamilies. Most of the plant PDR genes so far characterized belong to subfamily I and have been shown to be involved in responses to abiotic and biotic stress, in the latter case, probably by transporting antimicrobial secondary metabolites to the cell surface. Only a single subfamily II member has been characterized. Induction of its expression by iron deficiency suggests its involvement in iron deficiency stress, thus, enlightening a new physiological role for a PDR gene.
16375897	The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP/ABCC) subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters in plants.	2006	FEBS Lett	In many different plant species, genes belonging to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP, ABCC) subfamily of ABC transporters have been identified. Following the discovery of vacuolar transport systems for xenobiotic or plant-produced conjugated organic anions, plant MRPs were originally proposed to be primarily involved in the vacuolar sequestration of potentially toxic metabolites. Indeed, heterologous expression of different Arabidopsis MRPs in yeast demonstrates their activity as ATP-driven pumps for structurally diverse substrates. Recent analysis of protein-protein interactions and the characterization of knockout mutants in Arabidopsis suggests that apart from transport functions plant MRPs play additional roles including the control of plant transpiration through the stomata. Here, we review and discuss the diverse functions of plant MRP-type ABC transporters and present an organ-related and developmental analysis of the expression of Arabidopsis MRPs using the publicly available full-genome chip data.
21901091	Viral infection induces expression of novel phased microRNAs from conserved cellular microRNA precursors.	2011	PLoS Pathog	RNA silencing, mediated by small RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a potent antiviral or antibacterial mechanism, besides regulating normal cellular gene expression critical for development and physiology. To gain insights into host small RNA metabolism under infections by different viruses, we used Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing to characterize the small RNA profiles of rice plants infected by two distinct viruses, Rice dwarf virus (RDV, dsRNA virus) and Rice stripe virus (RSV, a negative sense and ambisense RNA virus), respectively, as compared with those from non-infected plants. Our analyses showed that RSV infection enhanced the accumulation of some rice miRNA*s, but not their corresponding miRNAs, as well as accumulation of phased siRNAs from a particular precursor. Furthermore, RSV infection also induced the expression of novel miRNAs in a phased pattern from several conserved miRNA precursors. In comparison, no such changes in host small RNA expression was observed in RDV-infected rice plants. Significantly RSV infection elevated the expression levels of selective OsDCLs and OsAGOs, whereas RDV infection only affected the expression of certain OsRDRs. Our results provide a comparative analysis, via deep sequencing, of changes in the small RNA profiles and in the genes of RNA silencing machinery induced by different viruses in a natural and economically important crop host plant. They uncover new mechanisms and complexity of virus-host interactions that may have important implications for further studies on the evolution of cellular small RNA biogenesis that impact pathogen infection, pathogenesis, as well as organismal development.
15805478	Cloning and characterization of microRNAs from rice.	2005	Plant Cell	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing family of small noncoding RNAs that downregulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The identification of the entire set of miRNAs from a model organism is a critical step toward understanding miRNA-guided gene regulation. Rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, two plant model species with fully sequenced genomes, are representatives of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous flowering plants, respectively. Thus far, experimental identification of miRNAs in plants has been confined to Arabidopsis. Computational analysis based on conservation with known miRNAs from Arabidopsis has predicted 20 families of miRNAs in rice. To identify miRNAs that are difficult to predict in silico or not conserved in Arabidopsis, we generated three cDNA libraries of small RNAs from rice shoot, root, and inflorescence tissues. We identified 35 miRNAs, of which 14 are new, and these define 13 new families. Thirteen of the new miRNAs are not conserved in Arabidopsis. Four of the new miRNAs are conserved in related monocot species but not in Arabidopsis, which suggests that these may have evolved after the divergence of monocots and dicots. The remaining nine new miRNAs appear to be absent in the known sequences of other plant species. Most of the rice miRNAs are expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined, whereas a few display tissue-specific expression. We predicted 46 genes as targets of the new rice miRNAs: 16 of these predicted targets encode transcription factors, and other target genes appear to play roles in diverse physiological processes. Four target genes have been experimentally verified by detection of miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage. Our identification of new miRNAs in rice suggests that these miRNAs may have evolved independently in rice or been lost in other species.
18312648	Identification of novel and candidate miRNAs in rice by high throughput sequencing.	2008	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Small RNA-guided gene silencing at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels has emerged as an important mode of gene regulation in plants and animals. Thus far, conventional sequencing of small RNA libraries from rice led to the identification of most of the conserved miRNAs. Deep sequencing of small RNA libraries is an effective approach to uncover rare and lineage- and/or species-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in any organism.

RESULTS: In order to identify new miRNAs and possibly abiotic-stress regulated small RNAs in rice, three small RNA libraries were constructed from control rice seedlings and seedlings exposed to drought or salt stress, and then subjected to pyrosequencing. A total of 58,781, 43,003 and 80,990 unique genome-matching small RNAs were obtained from the control, drought and salt stress libraries, respectively. Sequence analysis confirmed the expression of most of the conserved miRNAs in rice. Importantly, 23 new miRNAs mostly each derived from a unique locus in rice genome were identified. Six of the new miRNAs are conserved in other monocots. Additionally, we identified 40 candidate miRNAs. Allowing not more than 3 mis-matches between a miRNA and its target mRNA, we predicted 20 targets for 9 of the new miRNAs.

CONCLUSION: Deep sequencing proved to be an effective strategy that allowed the discovery of 23 low-abundance new miRNAs and 40 candidate miRNAs in rice.
21791435	Differential expression of the microRNAs in superior and inferior spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa).	2011	J Exp Bot	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation and have been shown to control many genes involved in various biological and metabolic processes. This work investigated miRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa), an important food crop. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to reveal expression differences in miRNAs between superior and inferior spikelets in rice (japonica cultivar Xinfeng 2) at 18 d after fertilization. Totals of 351 and 312 known miRNAs were obtained from the superior and inferior spikelets, respectively. Analysis of the expression profiles of these miRNAs showed that 189 miRNAs were differentially expressed between superior spikelets and inferior spikelets. In addition, 43 novel miRNAs were identified mostly by the accumulation of miRNA*s expressed differentially between the superior and inferior spikelets. Further analysis with bioinformatics software and comparison with existing databases showed that these differentially expressed miRNAs may individually participate in regulating hormone metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic pathways, and cell division during rice grain development. The results indicate that the slow grain-filling and low grain weight of rice inferior spikelets are attributed partly to differences in expression and function between superior and inferior spikelet miRNAs.
19951405	Plant polycistronic precursors containing non-homologous microRNAs target transcripts encoding functionally related proteins.	2009	Genome Biol	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous single-stranded small RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNAs involved in diverse biological processes. In plants, miRNAs are generally encoded as a single species in independent transcriptional units, referred to as MIRNA genes, in contrast to animal miRNAs, which are frequently clustered.

RESULTS: We performed a comparative genomic analysis in three model plants (rice, poplar and Arabidopsis) and characterized miRNA clusters containing two to eight miRNA species. These clusters usually encode miRNAs of the same family and certain share a common evolutionary origin across monocot and dicot lineages. In addition, we identified miRNA clusters harboring miRNAs with unrelated sequences that are usually not evolutionarily conserved. Strikingly, non-homologous miRNAs from the same cluster were predicted to target transcripts encoding related proteins. At least four Arabidopsis non-homologous clusters were expressed as single transcriptional units. Overexpression of one of these polycistronic precursors, producing Ath-miR859 and Ath-miR774, led to the DCL1-dependent accumulation of both miRNAs and down-regulation of their different mRNA targets encoding F-box proteins.

CONCLUSIONS: In addition to polycistronic precursors carrying related miRNAs, plants also contain precursors allowing coordinated expression of non-homologous miRNAs to co-regulate functionally related target transcripts. This mechanism paves the way for using polycistronic MIRNA precursors as a new molecular tool for plant biologists to simultaneously control the expression of different genes.
21352554	Discovery of barley miRNAs through deep sequencing of short reads.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are important components of the regulatory network of biological systems and thousands have been discovered in both animals and plants. Systematic investigations performed in species with sequenced genomes such as Arabidopsis, rice, poplar and Brachypodium have provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of this class of small RNAs among plants. However, miRNAs from barley, one of the most important cereal crops, remain unknown.

RESULTS: We performed a large scale study of barley miRNAs through deep sequencing of small RNAs extracted from leaves of two barley cultivars. By using the presence of miRNA precursor sequences in related genomes as one of a number of supporting criteria, we identified up to 100 miRNAs in barley. Of these only 56 have orthologs in wheat, rice or Brachypodium that are known to be expressed, while up to 44 appear to be specifically expressed in barley.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study, the first large scale investigation of small RNAs in barley, has identified up to 100 miRNAs. We demonstrate that reliable identification of miRNAs via deep sequencing in a species whose genome has not been sequenced requires a more careful analysis of sequencing errors than is commonly performed. We devised a read filtering procedure for dealing with errors. In addition, we found that the use of a large dataset of almost 35 million reads permits the use of read abundance distributions along putative precursor sequences as a practical tool for isolating miRNAs in a large background of reads originating from other non-coding and coding RNAs. This study therefore provides a generic approach for discovering novel miRNAs where no genome sequence is available.
16784536	The maize INDETERMINATE1 flowering time regulator defines a highly conserved zinc finger protein family in higher plants.	2006	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, ID1, is a key regulator of the transition to flowering and the founding member of a transcription factor gene family that encodes a protein with a distinct arrangement of zinc finger motifs. The zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make up the signature ID domain (IDD), which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes. The presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that ID1 binds to DNA suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS: Comparison of IDD genes identified in Arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all IDD genes discovered in maize EST and genomic databases, suggest that ID1 is a unique member of this gene family. High levels of sequence similarity amongst all IDD genes from maize, rice and Arabidopsis suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Several unique features of ID1 suggest that it is a divergent member of the maize IDD family. Although no clear ID1 ortholog was identified in the Arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond the ID domain were isolated from rice and sorghum. Phylogenetic comparisons show that these putative orthologs, along with maize ID1, form a group separate from other IDD genes. In contrast to ID1 mRNA, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize IDD genes showed a broad range of expression in various tissues. Further, Western analysis with an antibody that cross-reacts with ID1 protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three proteins are detected in immature leaves only.

CONCLUSION: Comparative genomic analysis shows that the IDD zinc finger family is highly conserved among both monocots and dicots. The leaf-specific ID1 expression pattern distinguishes it from other maize IDD genes examined. A similar leaf-specific localization pattern was observed for the putative ID1 protein orthologs from rice and sorghum. These similarities between ID1 and closely related genes in other grasses point to possible similarities in function.
16669754	MicroRNAS and their regulatory roles in plants.	2006	Annu Rev Plant Biol	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in plants and animals. In plants, these approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs are processed from stem-loop regions of long primary transcripts by a Dicer-like enzyme and are loaded into silencing complexes, where they generally direct cleavage of complementary mRNAs. Although plant miRNAs have some conserved functions extending beyond development, the importance of miRNA-directed gene regulation during plant development is now particularly clear. Identified in plants less than four years ago, miRNAs are already known to play numerous crucial roles at each major stage of development-typically at the cores of gene regulatory networks, targeting genes that are themselves regulators, such as those encoding transcription factors and F-box proteins.
19081140	Heavy metal-regulated new microRNAs from rice.	2009	J Inorg Biochem	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of short, endogenous non-coding small RNAs that have the ability to base pair with their target mRNAs to repress their translation or induce their degradation in both plants and animals. To identify heavy metal stress-regulated novel miRNAs, we constructed a library of small RNAs from rice seedlings that were exposed to toxic levels of cadmium (Cd(2+)). Sequencing of the library and subsequent analysis revealed 19 new miRNAs representing six families. These cloned new rice miRNAs have sequence conservation neither in Arabidopsis nor in any other species. Most of the new rice miRNAs were up- or down-regulated in response to the metal exposure. On the base of sequence complementarity, a total of 34 miRNA targets were predicted, of which 23 targets are functionally annotated and the other 11 records belong to unknown proteins. Some predicted targets of miRNAs are associated with the regulation of the response to heavy metal-induced stresses. In addition to the new miRNAs, we detected nine previously reported miRNAs and 56 other novel endogenous small RNAs in rice. These findings suggest that the number of new miRNAs in rice is unsaturated and some of them may play critical roles in plant responses to environmental stresses.
12468735	Abscisic acid-induced transcription is mediated by phosphorylation of an abscisic acid response element binding factor, TRAB1.	2002	Plant Cell	The rice basic domain/Leu zipper factor TRAB1 binds to abscisic acid (ABA) response elements and mediates ABA signals to activate transcription. We show that TRAB1 is phosphorylated rapidly in an in vivo labeling experiment and by phosphatase-sensitive mobility shifts on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We had shown previously that a chimeric promoter containing GAL4 binding sites became ABA inducible when a GAL4 binding domain-TRAB1 fusion protein was present. This expression system allowed us to assay the ABA response function of TRAB1. Using this system, we show that Ser-102 of TRAB1 is critical for this function. Because no ABA-induced mobility shift was observed when Ser-102 was replaced by Ala, we suggest that this Ser residue is phosphorylated in response to ABA. Cell fractionation experiments, as well as fluorescence microscopy observations of transiently expressed green fluorescent protein-TRAB1 fusion protein, indicated that TRAB1 was localized in the nucleus independently of ABA. Our results suggest that the terminal or nearly terminal event of the primary ABA signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation in the nucleus of preexisting TRAB1.
19399245	Ultra low-dose radiation: stress responses and impacts using rice as a grass model.	2009	Int J Mol Sci	We report molecular changes in leaves of rice plants (Oryza sativa L. - reference crop plant and grass model) exposed to ultra low-dose ionizing radiation, first using contaminated soil from the exclusion zone around Chernobyl reactor site. Results revealed induction of stress-related marker genes (Northern blot) and secondary metabolites (LC-MS/MS) in irradiated leaf segments over appropriate control. Second, employing the same in vitro model system, we replicated results of the first experiment using in-house fabricated sources of ultra low-dose gamma (gamma) rays and selected marker genes by RT-PCR. Results suggest the usefulness of the rice model in studying ultra low-dose radiation response/s.
22514699	Two homologous putative protein tyrosine phosphatases, OsPFA-DSP2 and AtPFA-DSP4, negatively regulate the pathogen response in transgenic plants.	2012	PLoS One	Protein phosphatases, together with protein kinases, regulate protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and play critical roles in plant growth and biotic stress responses. However, little is known about the biological functions of plant protein tyrosine dual-specificity phosphatase (PFA-DSP) in biotic stresses. Here, we found that OsPFA-DSP2 was mainly expressed in calli, seedlings, roots, and young panicles, and localized in cytoplasm and nucleus. Ectopic overexpression of OsPFA-DSP2 in rice increased sensitivity to Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea Z1 strain), inhibited the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and suppressed the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes after fungal infection. Interestingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPFA-DSP4, which is homologous to OsPFA-DSP2, also exhibited sensitivity to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), reduced accumulation of H(2)O(2) and decreased photosynthesic capacity after infection compared with Col-0. These results indicate that OsPFA-DSP2 and AtPFA-DSP4 act as negative regulators of the pathogen response in transgenic plants.
12805592	Genomic comparison of P-type ATPase ion pumps in Arabidopsis and rice.	2003	Plant Physiol	Members of the P-type ATPase ion pump superfamily are found in all three branches of life. Forty-six P-type ATPase genes were identified in Arabidopsis, the largest number yet identified in any organism. The recent completion of two draft sequences of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome allows for comparison of the full complement of P-type ATPases in two different plant species. Here, we identify a similar number (43) in rice, despite the rice genome being more than three times the size of Arabidopsis. The similarly large families suggest that both dicots and monocots have evolved with a large preexisting repertoire of P-type ATPases. Both Arabidopsis and rice have representative members in all five major subfamilies of P-type ATPases: heavy-metal ATPases (P1B), Ca2+-ATPases (endoplasmic reticulum-type Ca2+-ATPase and autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase, P2A and P2B), H+-ATPases (autoinhibited H+-ATPase, P3A), putative aminophospholipid ATPases (ALA, P4), and a branch with unknown specificity (P5). The close pairing of similar isoforms in rice and Arabidopsis suggests potential orthologous relationships for all 43 rice P-type ATPases. A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates that the common angiosperm ancestor had at least 23 P-type ATPases. Although little is known about unique and common features of related pumps, clear differences between some members of the calcium pumps indicate that evolutionarily conserved clusters may distinguish pumps with either different subcellular locations or biochemical functions.
9076986	Differential expression of a CAK (cdc2-activating kinase)-like protein kinase, cyclins and cdc2 genes from rice during the cell cycle and in response to gibberellin.	1997	Plant J	Progress through the eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent cdc2 protein kinases. In rice (Oryza sativa L), two cdc2 protein kinases, cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2, and two cyclins, cycOs1 and cycOs2, have been described. In this study, we report on the cell-cycle phase-specific expression of these genes. Using partially synchronized suspension cells from rice, we found that cdc2Os-1 was expressed constitutively throughout the cell cycle. The cdc2Os-2 transcript level was elevated in G1 and S phase. The cycOs1 and cycOs2 transcripts increased steadily through G2 and dropped off rapidly in mitosis as is typical for mitotic cyclins. We hypothesize that the cdc2Os-2 gene product acts in G1/S and that the growth-promoting hormone gibberellin (GA) that induces expression of cdc2Os-2, cycOs1 and cycOs2 in the intercalary meristem of deepwater rice internodes accelerates G1/S phase progression through increased expression of cdc2Os-2 and G2/M phase progression through increased expression of the mitotic cyclins cycOs1 and cycOs2. The R2 gene from rice has 55% sequence identity to the cdc2-activating kinase (CAK) family of protein kinases which have been shown to phosphorylate and thereby activate cdc2 protein kinases in animals and yeast. In partially synchronized suspension cells, R2 mRNA levels were elevated in G1 and S phase. In GA-treated rice internodes, R2 transcript levels were elevated in the meristem and part of the elongation zone. These results are consistent with a role for R2 in regulating G1/S phase progression.
11826308	The rice cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase R2 regulates S-phase progression.	2002	Plant Cell	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are the central components of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. Phosphorylation of CDKs at a conserved threonine residue is required for their full activity and is mediated by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The CAK R2 from rice belongs to those CAKs that phosphorylate not only CDKs but also the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. We showed that R2 is a nuclear protein with increased expression and increased CTD kinase activity in S-phase. Increasing R2 abundance through a transgenic approach accelerated S-phase progression and overall growth rate in suspension cells. In planta, the CTD kinase activity of R2 was induced by a growth-promoting signal. R2 regulation, therefore, may constitute a plant-specific adaptive mechanism that is used to adjust the rate of cell proliferation in response to a changing environment.
10036778	A rice homolog of Cdk7/MO15 phosphorylates both cyclin-dependent protein kinases and the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.	1998	Plant J	The activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) requires phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The R2 protein of rice is very similar to CAKs of animals and fission yeast at the amino acid level but phosphorylation by R2 has not yet been demonstrated. When R2 was overexpressed in a CAK-deficient mutant of budding yeast, it suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mutation. Immunoprecipitates of rice proteins with the anti-R2 antibody phosphorylated human CDK2, one of the rice CDKs (Cdc2Os1), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II of Arabidopsis. Mutational analysis indicated that R2 phosphorylated the threonine residue within the T-loop of CDK2 and Cdc2Os1. R2 was found mainly in two protein complexes which had molecular masses of 190 kDa and 70 kDa, respectively, whilst the CDK- and CTD-kinase activities associated with R2 were identified in a complex of 105 kDa. These results indicate that R2 is closely related to CAKs of animals and fission yeast in terms of its phosphorylation activity and, moreover, that this CAK of rice is distinct from a CAK of the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis.
23800963	Salt-responsive ERF1 regulates reactive oxygen species-dependent signaling during the initial response to salt stress in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	Early detection of salt stress is vital for plant survival and growth. Still, the molecular processes controlling early salt stress perception and signaling are not fully understood. Here, we identified salt-responsive ERF1 (SERF1), a rice (Oryza sativa) transcription factor (TF) gene that shows a root-specific induction upon salt and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. Loss of SERF1 impairs the salt-inducible expression of genes encoding members of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and salt tolerance-mediating TFs. Furthermore, we show that SERF1-dependent genes are H2O2 responsive and demonstrate that SERF1 binds to the promoters of MAPK kinase kinase6 (MAP3K6), MAPK5, dehydration-responsive element bindinG2A (DREB2A), and zinc finger protein179 (ZFP179) in vitro and in vivo. SERF1 also directly induces its own gene expression. In addition, SERF1 is a phosphorylation target of MAPK5, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity of SERF1 toward its direct target genes. In agreement, plants deficient for SERF1 are more sensitive to salt stress compared with the wild type, while constitutive overexpression of SERF1 improves salinity tolerance. We propose that SERF1 amplifies the reactive oxygen species-activated MAPK cascade signal during the initial phase of salt stress and translates the salt-induced signal into an appropriate expressional response resulting in salt tolerance.
23957671	A comparative approach expands the protein-protein interaction node of the immune receptor XA21 in wheat and rice.	2013	Genome	The rice (Oryza sativa) OsXA21 receptor kinase is a well-studied immune receptor that initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Two homologs of OsXA21 were identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum): TaXA21-like1 located in a syntenic region with OsXA21, and TaXA21-like2 located in a nonsyntenic region. Proteins encoded by these two wheat genes interact with four wheat orthologs of known OsXA21 interactors. In this study, we screened a wheat yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) library using the cytosolic portion of TaXA21-like1 as bait to identify additional interactors. Using full-length T. aestivum and T. monococcum proteins and Y2H assays we identified three novel TaXA21-like1 interactors (TaARG, TaPR2, TmSKL1) plus one previously known in rice (TaSGT1). An additional full-length wheat protein (TaCIPK14) interacted with TaXA21-like2 and OsXA21 but not with TaXA21-like1. The interactions of TaXA21-like1 with TmSKL1 and TaSGT1 were also observed in rice protoplasts using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We then cloned the rice homologs of the novel wheat interactors and confirmed that they all interact with OsXA21. This last result suggests that interspecific comparative interactome analyses can be used not only to transfer known interactions from rice to wheat, but also to identify novel interactions in rice.
23769924	QTL mapping of grain weight in rice and the validation of the QTL qTGW3.2.	2013	Gene	A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population bred from a cross between a javanica type (cv. D50) and an indica type (cv. HB277) rice was used to map seven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for thousand grain weight (TGW). The loci were distributed on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10. The chromosome 3 QTL qTGW3.2 was stably expressed over two years, and contributed 9-10% of the phenotypic variance. A residual heterozygous line (RHL) was selected from the RIL population and its selfed progeny was used to fine map qTGW3.2. In this "F2" population, the QTL explained about 23% of the variance, rising to nearly 33% in the subsequent "F2:3" generation. The physical location of qTGW3.2 was confined to a ~556 kb region flanked by the microsatellite loci RM16162 and RM16194. The region also contains other factors influencing certain yield-related traits, although it is also possible that qTGW3.2 affects these in a pleiotropic fashion.
23787154	Structural features important for the RNA chaperone activity of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins from wheat (Triticum avestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Phytochemistry	Despite the increase in understanding of RNA chaperone activity of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (RZs) during the cold adaptation process, the structural features relevant to the RNA chaperone activity of RZs still largely remain to be established. To investigate the structural determinants important for the RNA chaperone activity of RZs, domain-swapping and deletion analyses was carried out to assess the contribution of the N-terminal zinc finger RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain and the C-terminal glycine-rich region of wheat (Triticum avestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) RZs to RNA chaperone activity. Although the amino acid sequence similarity among wheat TaRZ2, wheat TaRZ3, and rice OsRZ1 was high, only TaRZ2 had RNA chaperone activity as evidenced by complementation ability in cold-sensitive Escherichia coli mutant cell under cold stress and in vivo and in vitro nucleic acid-melting activity. Domain-swapping and deletion analysis demonstrated that the overall folding of RZs governed by the N-terminal RRM domain and the C-terminal glycine-rich region, as well as the size of the disordered C-terminal glycine-rich region, are crucial for the RNA chaperone activity of RZs. Collectively, these results indicate that a specific modular arrangement of RRM domain and the disordered C-terminal region determines the RNA chaperone activity of RZs in cells.
23820081	Expression of antimicrobial peptides thanatin(S) in transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced resistance to phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria.	2013	Gene	Thanatin(S) is an analog of thanatin, an insect antimicrobial peptide possessing strong and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. In order to investigate if the thanatin could be used in engineering transgenic plants for increased resistance against phytopathogens, the synthetic thanatin(S) was introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana plants. To increase the expression level of thanatin(S) in plants, the coding sequence was optimized by plant-preference codon. To avoid cellular protease degradation, signal peptide of rice Cht1 was fused to N terminal of thanatin(S) for secreting the expressed thanatin(S) into intercellular spaces. To evaluate the application value of thanatin(S) in plant disease control, the synthesized coding sequence of Cht1 signal peptide (Cht1SP)-thanatin(S) was ligated to plant gateway destination binary vectors pGWB11 (with FLAG tag). Meanwhile, in order to observe the subcellular localization of Cht1SP-thanatin(S)-GFP and thanatin(S)-GFP, the sequences of Cht1SP-thanatin(S) and thanatin(S) were respectively linked to pGWB5 (with GFP tag). The constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 and mutant pad4-1 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transformants with Cht1SP-thanatin(S)-FLAG fusion gene were analyzed by genomic PCR, real-time PCR, and western blots and the transgenic Arabidopsis plants introduced respectively Cht1SP-thanatin(S)-GFP and thanatin(S)-GFP were observed by confocal microscopy. Transgenic plants expressing Cht1SP-thanatin(S)-FLAG fusion protein showed antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea and powdery mildew, as well as antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. And the results from confocal observation showed that the GFP signal from Cht1SP-thanatin(S)-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants occurred mainly in intercellular space, while that from thanatin(S)-GFP transgenic plants was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and that from empty vector transgenic plants was distributed uniformly throughout the cell, demonstrating that Cht1 signal peptide functioned. In addition, thanatin(S) and thanatin(S)-FLAG chemically synthesized have both in vitro antimicrobial activities against P. syringae pv. tomato and B. cinerea. So, thanatin(S) is an ideal candidate AMPs for the construction of transgenic crops endowed with a broad-spectrum resistance to phytopathogens and the strategy is feasible to link a signal peptide to the target gene.
23756196	Major cis-regulatory elements for rice bidirectional promoter activity reside in the 5'-untranslated regions.	2013	Gene	Bidirectional promoters are defined as those that regulate adjacent genes organized in a divergent fashion (head to head orientation) and separated by <1 kb. In order to dissect bidirectional promoter activity in a model plant, deletion analysis was performed for seven rice promoters using promoter-reporter gene constructs, which identified three promoters to be bidirectional. Regulatory elements located in or close to the 5'-untranslated regions (UTR) of one of the genes (divergent gene pair) were found to be responsible for their bidirectional activity. DNA footprinting analysis identified unique protein binding sites in these promoters. Deletion/alteration of these motifs resulted in significant loss of expression of the reporter genes on either side of the promoter. Changes in the motifs at both the positions resulted in a remarkable decrease in bidirectional activity of the reporter genes flanking the promoter. Based on our results, we propose a novel mechanism for the bidirectionality of rice bidirectional promoters.
23957676	Cloning and characterization of serpin-like genes from the striped rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.	2013	Genome	Serpins, also called serine proteinase inhibitors, are widely distributed in eukaryotes. In insects, serpins play important roles in regulating immune responses, gut physiology, and other processes. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of 12 serpin-like cDNAs from the striped rice stem borer (Chilo suppressalis), a major rice pest. The putative proteins share significant sequence similarity with known insect serpins, especially those from lepidopterons. Analysis of functional domains revealed that nine of the cloned serpins are putative trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like inhibitors; two are mixed-type serpins that may act as inhibitors for trypsins, elastases, or thrombin; and the remaining one is truncate. The potential functions of these serpins in interacting with host plants were also investigated by analyzing tissue-specific expression and the impact of different host plant genotypes on gene expression. Our results provide a foundation for future studies on the role of serpins in gut physiology in the striped rice stem borer, and also useful information for comparative analyses of serpins from different insect species.
23872535	The integrative expression and co-expression analysis of the AGO gene family in rice.	2013	Gene	Argonautes (AGOs) play crucial roles in RNAi and related pathways in several species and regulate plant growth and development. However the investigation in rice argonautes (OsAGOs) remains elusive. Here we focused on the expression pattern and co-expression profiles of OsAGO genes. Microarray-based and qRT-PCR expression profiling of 19 OsAGO genes indicated that most OsAGOs expressed specifically and preferentially during stages of reproductive development, and exhibited preferential up-regulation in panicle stages. Six OsAGO genes showed specific up/down-regulation in response to Gibberellin A3 (GA3), Kinetin (KT), or 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) treatments. And three OsAGOs presented specific up-regulation in response to light and dark treatments. Ten OsAGOs were co-expressed with Dicer-like (DCL), Double-stranded RNA Binding (DRB) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) genes, which were related with RNA processing including RNAi pathways. Twelve OsAGOs were correlated with 17 kinds of transcription factors involving diverse functions. Four OsAGOs RNAi plants were constructed, the expression level of co-expression genes, including DCL3, DRB2, RDR4 etc., were changed while OsAGOs were down-regulated in RNAi lines, providing experimental evidence for co-expression networks. The results provide new insights in understanding the biological pathways of OsAGO genes, as well as in selecting the candidate genes involved in RNA silencing mechanisms.
23839787	Plant microRNAs display differential 3' truncation and tailing modifications that are ARGONAUTE1 dependent and conserved across species.	2013	Plant Cell	Plant small RNAs are 3' methylated by the methyltransferase HUA1 ENHANCER1 (HEN1). In plant hen1 mutants, 3' modifications of small RNAs, including oligo-uridylation (tailing), are associated with accelerated degradation of microRNAs (miRNAs). By sequencing small RNAs of the wild type and hen1 mutants from Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and maize (Zea mays), we found 3' truncation prior to tailing is widespread in these mutants. Moreover, the patterns of miRNA truncation and tailing differ substantially among miRNA families but are conserved across species. The same patterns are also observable in wild-type libraries from a broad range of species, only at lower abundances. ARGONAUTE (AGO1), even with defective slicer activity, can bind these truncated and tailed variants of miRNAs. An ago1 mutation in hen1 suppressed such 3' modifications, indicating that they occur while miRNAs are in association with AGO1, either during or after RNA-induced silencing complex assembly. Our results showed AGO1-bound miRNAs are actively 3' truncated and tailed, possibly reflecting the activity of cofactors acting in conserved patterns in miRNA degradation.
23836636	Recycling rice husks for high-capacity lithium battery anodes.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The rice husk is the outer covering of a rice kernel and protects the inner ingredients from external attack by insects and bacteria. To perform this function while ventilating air and moisture, rice plants have developed unique nanoporous silica layers in their husks through years of natural evolution. Despite the massive amount of annual production near 10(8) tons worldwide, so far rice husks have been recycled only for low-value agricultural items. In an effort to recycle rice husks for high-value applications, we convert the silica to silicon and use it for high-capacity lithium battery anodes. Taking advantage of the interconnected nanoporous structure naturally existing in rice husks, the converted silicon exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as a lithium battery anode, suggesting that rice husks can be a massive resource for use in high-capacity lithium battery negative electrodes.
23644253	Genome-wide analysis of the WRKY gene family in physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.).	2013	Gene	The WRKY proteins, which contain highly conserved WRKYGQK amino acid sequences and zinc-finger-like motifs, constitute a large family of transcription factors in plants. They participate in diverse physiological and developmental processes. WRKY genes have been identified and characterized in a number of plant species. We identified a total of 58 WRKY genes (JcWRKY) in the genome of the physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.). On the basis of their conserved WRKY domain sequences, all of the JcWRKY proteins could be assigned to one of the previously defined groups, I-III. Phylogenetic analysis of JcWRKY genes with Arabidopsis and rice WRKY genes, and separately with castor bean WRKY genes, revealed no evidence of recent gene duplication in JcWRKY gene family. Analysis of transcript abundance of JcWRKY gene products were tested in different tissues under normal growth condition. In addition, 47 WRKY genes responded to at least one abiotic stress (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation and nitrogen starvation) in individual tissues (leaf, root and/or shoot cortex). Our study provides a useful reference data set as the basis for cloning and functional analysis of physic nut WRKY genes.
23950527	Vietnam turns back a 'tsunami of pesticides'.	2013	Science	
23958655	Expression analysis of rice VQ genes in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.	2013	Gene	WRKY transcription factors are encoded by a large gene superfamily with a broad range of roles in plants. Proteins containing a short VQ (FxxxVQxLTG) motif have been recently shown to interact with WRKY transcription factors, implying that AtVQ proteins are important in the plant defense responses in Arabidopsis, either as positive or negative cofactors of WRKY transcription factors. Thirty-nine Oryza sativa genes containing the VQ motif (OsVQs) were identified and the genome structures of OsVQ proteins were characterized through genome-wide analysis in rice. Also, phylogenetic tree analysis was performed with the VQ domain of Arabidopsis and rice. The expression patterns of these OsVQ genes in plants under several stress treatments were assessed, specifically, following infection with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), or exposure to drought. The cellular localization of a few OsVQ proteins was examined using rice protoplast system. Based on our results, we suggest that OsVQ proteins function as important co-regulators during the plant defense response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
23979580	Is the fungus Magnaporthe losing DNA methylation?	2013	Genetics	The long terminal repeat retrotransposon, Magnaporthe gypsy-like element (MAGGY), has been shown to be targeted for cytosine methylation in a subset of Magnaporthe oryzae field isolates. Analysis of the F1 progeny from a genetic cross between methylation-proficient (Br48) and methylation-deficient (GFSI1-7-2) isolates revealed that methylation of the MAGGY element was governed by a single dominant gene. Positional cloning followed by gene disruption and complementation experiments revealed that the responsible gene was the DNA methyltransferase, MoDMT1, an ortholog of Neurospora crassa Dim-2. A survey of MAGGY methylation in 60 Magnaporthe field isolates revealed that 42 isolates from rice, common millet, wheat, finger millet, and buffelgrass were methylation proficient while 18 isolates from foxtail millet, green bristlegrass, Japanese panicgrass, torpedo grass, Guinea grass, and crabgrass were methylation deficient. Phenotypic analyses showed that MoDMT1 plays no major role in development and pathogenicity of the fungus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the average copy number of genomic MAGGY elements was not significantly different between methylation-deficient and -proficient field isolates even though the levels of MAGGY transcript were generally higher in the former group. MoDMT1 gene sequences in the methylation-deficient isolates suggested that at least three independent mutations were responsible for the loss of MoDMT1 function. Overall, our data suggest that MoDMT1 is not essential for the natural life cycle of the fungus and raise the possibility that the genus Magnaporthe may be losing the mechanism of DNA methylation on the evolutionary time scale.
23948082	Genome-wide analysis of endosperm-specific genes in rice.	2013	Gene	The endosperm of the cereal crop is an important nutrient source for humans. It also acts as a critical integrator of plant seed growth and development. Despite its importance, the comprehensive understanding in regulating of endosperm development in rice remains elusive. Here, we performed a genomic survey comprising the identification and functional characterization of the endosperm-specific genes (OsEnS) in rice using Affymetrix microarray data and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. A total of 151 endosperm-specific genes were identified, and the expression patterns of 13 selected genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Promoter regions of the endosperm-specific expression genes were analyzed by PLACE Signal Scan Search. The results indicated that some motifs were involved in endosperm-specific expression regulation, and some cis-elements were responsible for hormone regulation. The bootstrap analysis indicated that the RY repeat (CATGCA box) was over-represented in promoter regions of endosperm-specific expression genes. GO analysis indicated that these genes could be classified into 12 groups, namely, transcription factor, stress/defense, seed storage protein (SSP), carbohydrate and energy metabolism, seed maturation, protein metabolism, lipid metabolism, transport, cell wall related, hormone related, signal transduction, and one unclassified group. Taken together, our results provide informative clues for further functional characterization of the endosperm-specific genes, which facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism in rice endosperm development.
23913002	Control of root system architecture by DEEPER ROOTING 1 increases rice yield under drought conditions.	2013	Nat Genet	The genetic improvement of drought resistance is essential for stable and adequate crop production in drought-prone areas. Here we demonstrate that alteration of root system architecture improves drought avoidance through the cloning and characterization of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1), a rice quantitative trait locus controlling root growth angle. DRO1 is negatively regulated by auxin and is involved in cell elongation in the root tip that causes asymmetric root growth and downward bending of the root in response to gravity. Higher expression of DRO1 increases the root growth angle, whereby roots grow in a more downward direction. Introducing DRO1 into a shallow-rooting rice cultivar by backcrossing enabled the resulting line to avoid drought by increasing deep rooting, which maintained high yield performance under drought conditions relative to the recipient cultivar. Our experiments suggest that control of root system architecture will contribute to drought avoidance in crops.
23934883	Genome-wide prediction of traits with different genetic architecture through efficient variable selection.	2013	Genetics	In genome-based prediction there is considerable uncertainty about the statistical model and method required to maximize prediction accuracy. For traits influenced by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), predictions are expected to benefit from methods performing variable selection [e.g., BayesB or the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] compared to methods distributing effects across the genome [ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP)]. We investigate the assumptions underlying successful variable selection by combining computer simulations with large-scale experimental data sets from rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). We demonstrate that variable selection can be successful when the number of phenotyped individuals is much larger than the number of causal mutations contributing to the trait. We show that the sample size required for efficient variable selection increases dramatically with decreasing trait heritabilities and increasing extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We contrast and discuss contradictory results from simulation and experimental studies with respect to superiority of variable selection methods over RR-BLUP. Our results demonstrate that due to long-range LD, medium heritabilities, and small sample sizes, superiority of variable selection methods cannot be expected in plant breeding populations even for traits like FRIGIDA gene expression in Arabidopsis and flowering time in rice, assumed to be influenced by a few major QTL. We extend our conclusions to the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and infer upper bounds for the number of causal mutations which can be identified by LASSO. Our results have major impact on the choice of statistical method needed to make credible inferences about genetic architecture and prediction accuracy of complex traits.

23979575	Genetic mapping and genomic selection using recombination breakpoint data.	2013	Genetics	The correct models for quantitative trait locus mapping are the ones that simultaneously include all significant genetic effects. Such models are difficult to handle for high marker density. Improving statistical methods for high-dimensional data appears to have reached a plateau. Alternative approaches must be explored to break the bottleneck of genomic data analysis. The fact that all markers are located in a few chromosomes of the genome leads to linkage disequilibrium among markers. This suggests that dimension reduction can also be achieved through data manipulation. High-density markers are used to infer recombination breakpoints, which then facilitate construction of bins. The bins are treated as new synthetic markers. The number of bins is always a manageable number, on the order of a few thousand. Using the bin data of a recombinant inbred line population of rice, we demonstrated genetic mapping, using all bins in a simultaneous manner. To facilitate genomic selection, we developed a method to create user-defined (artificial) bins, in which breakpoints are allowed within bins. Using eight traits of rice, we showed that artificial bin data analysis often improves the predictability compared with natural bin data analysis. Of the eight traits, three showed high predictability, two had intermediate predictability, and two had low predictability. A binary trait with a known gene had predictability near perfect. Genetic mapping using bin data points to a new direction of genomic data analysis.
23940322	Dissecting yield-associated loci in super hybrid rice by resequencing recombinant inbred lines and improving parental genome sequences.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The growing world population and shrinkage of arable land demand yield improvement of rice, one of the most important staple crops. To elucidate the genetic basis of yield and uncover its associated loci in rice, we resequenced the core recombinant inbred lines of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu, the widely cultivated super hybrid rice, and constructed a high-resolution linkage map. We detected 43 yield-associated quantitative trait loci, of which 20 are unique. Based on the high-density physical map, the genome sequences of paternal variety 93-11 and maternal cultivar PA64s of Liang-You-Pei-Jiu were significantly improved. The large recombinant inbred line population combined with plentiful high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions between parental genomes allowed us to fine-map two quantitative trait loci, qSN8 and qSPB1, and to identify days to heading8 and lax panicle1 as candidate genes, respectively. The quantitative trait locus qSN8 was further confirmed to be days to heading8 by a complementation test. Our study provided an ideal platform for molecular breeding by targeting and dissecting yield-associated loci in rice.
23943860	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	In meiosis, homologous recombination entails programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly coupled with the DSB repair. Although SCs display extensive structural conservation among species, their components identified are poorly conserved at the sequence level. Here, we identified a novel SC component, designated central region component1 (CRC1), in rice (Oryza sativa). CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion. Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. CRC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae pachytene checkpoint2 (Pch2) and Mus musculus THYROID receptor-interacting protein13 (TRIP13) and may be a conserved SC component. Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation. CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation. PAIR2, the rice ortholog of budding yeast homolog pairing1, is required for homologous chromosome pairing. We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes. The roles of CRC1 identified here have not been reported for Pch2 or TRIP13.
23777258	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	In rice, the Ca(2+) /calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) OsDMI3 has been shown to be required for abscisic acid (ABA)-induced antioxidant defence. However, it is not clear how OsDMI3 participates in this process in rice. In this study, the cross-talk between OsDMI3 and the major ABA-activated MAPK OsMPK1 in ABA-induced antioxidant defence was investigated. ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves. In the mutant of OsDMI3, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsMPK1 were substantially reduced. But in the mutant of OsMPK1, the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 were not affected. Pretreatments with MAPKK inhibitors also did not affect the ABA-induced activation of OsDMI3. Further, a transient expression analysis in combination with mutant analysis in rice protoplasts showed that OsMPK1 is required for OsDMI3-induced increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 . Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice.
23756993	Sequence and expression analyses of KIX domain proteins suggest their importance in seed development and determination of seed size in rice, and genome stability in Arabidopsis.	2013	Mol Genet Genomics	The KIX domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions, was first discovered as a motif in the large multidomain transcriptional activator histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP. Later, the domain was also found in Mediator subunit MED15, where it interacts with many transcription factors. In both proteins, the KIX domain is a target of activation domains of diverse transcription activators. It was found to be an essential component of several specific gene-activation pathways in fungi and metazoans. Not much is known about KIX domain proteins in plants. This study aims to characterize all the KIX domain proteins encoded by the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice. All identified KIX domain proteins are presented, together with their chromosomal locations, phylogenetic analysis, expression and SNP analyses. KIX domains were found not only in p300/CBP- and MED15-like plant proteins, but also in F-box proteins in rice and DNA helicase in Arabidopsis, suggesting roles of KIX domains in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and genome stability. Expression analysis revealed overlapping expression of OsKIX_3, OsKIX_5 and OsKIX_7 in different stages of rice seeds development. Moreover, an association analysis of 136 in silico mined SNP loci in 23 different rice genotypes with grain-length information identified three non-synonymous SNP loci in these three rice genes showing strong association with long- and short-grain differentiation. Interestingly, these SNPs were located within KIX domain encoding sequences. Overall, this study lays a foundation for functional analysis of KIX domain proteins in plants.
23811195	Enzymatic and structural characterization of hydrolysis of gibberellin A4 glucosyl ester by a rice β-D-glucosidase.	2013	Arch Biochem Biophys	In order to identify a rice gibberellin ester β-D-glucosidase, gibberellin A4 β-D-glucosyl ester (GA4-GE) was synthesized and used to screen rice β-glucosidases. Os3BGlu6 was found to have the highest hydrolysis activity to GA4-GE among five recombinantly expressed rice glycoside hydrolase family GH1 enzymes from different phylogenic clusters. The kinetic parameters of Os3BGlu6 and its mutants E178Q, E178A, E394D, E394Q and M251N for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) and GA4-GE confirmed the roles of the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile for hydrolysis of both substrates and suggested M251 contributes to binding hydrophobic aglycones. The activities of the Os3BGlu6 E178Q and E178A acid/base mutants were rescued by azide, which they transglucosylate to produce β-D-glucopyranosyl azide, in a pH-dependent manner, while acetate also rescued Os3BGlu6 E178A at low pH. High concentrations of sodium azide (200-400 mM) inhibited Os3BGlu6 E178Q but not Os3BGlu6 E178A. The structures of Os3BGlu6 E178Q crystallized with either GA4-GE or pNPGlc had a native α-D-glucosyl moiety covalently linked to the catalytic nucleophile, E394, which showed the hydrogen bonding to the 2-hydroxyl in the covalent intermediate. These data suggest that a GH1 β-glucosidase uses the same retaining catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze 1-O-acyl glucose ester and glucoside.
23762371	Genome-wide identification, phylogenetic and co-expression analysis of OsSET gene family in rice.	2013	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: SET domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) during developmental process. Histone lysine methylation plays a crucial and diverse regulatory function in chromatin organization and genome function. Although several SET genes have been identified and characterized in plants, the understanding of OsSET gene family in rice is still very limited.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a systematic analysis was performed and revealed the presence of at least 43 SET genes in rice genome. Phylogenetic and structural analysis grouped SET proteins into five classes, and supposed that the domains out of SET domain were significant for the specific of histone lysine methylation, as well as the recognition of methylated histone lysine. Based on the global microarray, gene expression profile revealed that the transcripts of OsSET genes were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Cis-elements identification, co-expression analysis and GO analysis of expression correlation of 12 OsSET genes suggested that OsSET genes might be involved in cell cycle regulation and feedback.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study will facilitate further studies on OsSET family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsSETs.
23812082	Ectopic overexpression of an AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) gene OsIAA4 in rice induces morphological changes and reduces responsiveness to Auxin.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	Auxin has pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate auxin responses through interaction with an auxin receptor, the F-box protein transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). Most functions of Aux/IAA proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis by studying the gain-of-function mutants in domain II. In this study, we isolated and identified an Aux/IAA protein gene from rice, OsIAA4, whose protein contains a dominant mutation-type domain II. OsIAA4 has very low expression in the entire life cycle of rice. OsIAA4-overexpressing rice plants show dwarfism, increased tiller angles, reduced gravity response, and are less sensitive to synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).
23849131	Mutation of OsDET1 increases chlorophyll content in rice.	2013	Plant Sci	As an important agronomic trait, the chlorophyll (Chl) content is closely related to photosynthesis in plants. A rice mutant Gc (Oryza sativa indica) was characterized previously by its enhanced Chl content (Chl b and total Chl) and exaggerated photosynthetic rate. Here, we describe the enhanced Chl content was caused by a mutation in the rice homolog of the DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) known to be involved in light transduction and morphogenesis in Arabidopsis and tomato. Sequence analysis revealed that the Gc mutant carried two fragment-insertions and a fragment-deletion upstream of the start codon of OsDET1, which led to enhance mRNA levels of OsDET1. Besides, the Gc mutant harbored a single T-to-C base transversion in the seventh exon of OsDET1, which resulted in leucine(328) to serine(328) localized in the highly conserved region. Genetic complementation demonstrated that OsDET1 mutation conferred the enhanced Chl content in the Gc mutant leaf. OsDET1 was richly expressed in green tissues, and its expression seems to be under circadian control. OsDET1-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells showed that OsDET1 localized to the nucleus. These results indicated that OsDET1 mutation in Gc mutant increases Chl content in rice, which might be fundamental for enhanced photoresponsiveness.
23793712	MRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing in rice meiosis.	2013	Chromosoma	Mre11, a conserved protein found in organisms ranging from yeast to multicellular organisms, is required for normal meiotic recombination. Mre11 interacts with Rad50 and Nbs1/Xrs2 to form a complex (MRN/X) that participates in double-strand break (DSB) ends processing. In this study, we silenced the MRE11 gene in rice and detailed its function using molecular and cytological methods. The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed. Cytological analysis indicated that in the OsMRE11-deficient plants, homologous pairing was totally inhibited, and the chromosomes were completely entangled as a formation of multivalents at metaphase I, leading to the consequence of serious chromosome fragmentation during anaphase I. Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation. We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene. This protein showed normal localization in zep1, Oscom1 and Osmer3, as well as in OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants, but not in pair2 and pair3 mutants. Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis.
23849121	Oligomerization of rice granule-bound starch synthase 1 modulates its activity regulation.	2013	Plant Sci	Granule-bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1) is responsible for amylose synthesis in cereals, and this enzyme is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In this study, we show that GBSS1 from Oryza sativa L. (OsGBSS1) can form oligomers in rice endosperm, and oligomerized OsGBSS1 exhibits much higher specific enzymatic activity than the monomer. A monomer-oligomer transition equilibrium for OsGBSS1 occurs in the endosperm during development. Redox potential is a key factor affecting the oligomer percentage as well as the enzymatic activity of OsGBSS1. Adenosine diphosphate glucose, the direct donor of glucose, also impacts OsGBSS1 oligomerization in a concentration-dependent manner. OsGBSS1 oligomerization is influenced by phosphorylation status, which was strongly enhanced by Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ATP treatment and was sharply weakened by protein phosphatase (PPase) treatment. The activity of OsGBSS1 affects the ratio of amylose to amylopectin and therefore the eating quality of rice. Understanding the regulation of OsGBSS1 activity may lead to the improvement of rice eating quality.
23803583	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants.	2013	Plant Physiol	The plastidic caseinolytic protease (Clp) of higher plants is an evolutionarily conserved protein degradation apparatus composed of a proteolytic core complex (the P and R rings) and a set of accessory proteins (ClpT, ClpC, and ClpS). The role and molecular composition of Clps in higher plants has just begun to be unraveled, mostly from studies with the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period. The young chlorotic leaves turn green in later developmental stages, accompanied by alterations in chlorophyll accumulation, chloroplast ultrastructure, and the expression of chloroplast development- and photosynthesis-related genes. Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast. VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development. The mutation in vyl causes premature termination of the predicted gene product and loss of the conserved catalytic triad (serine-histidine-aspartate) and the polypeptide-binding site of VYL. Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo. In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4. Furthermore, we found that OsClpP3 directly interacts with OsClpT, that OsClpP4 directly interacts with OsClpP5 and OsClpT, and that both OsClpP4 and OsClpT can homodimerize. Together, our data provide new insights into the function, assembly, and regulation of Clps in higher plants.
23743654	Overexpression of the glutamine synthetase gene modulates oxidative stress response in rice after exposure to cadmium stress.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Overexpression of OsGS gene modulates oxidative stress response in rice after exposure to cadmium stress. Our results describe the features of transformants with enhanced tolerance to Cd and abiotic stresses. Glutamine synthetase (GS) (EC 6.3.1.2) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine. Exposure of plants to cadmium (Cd) has been reported to decrease GS activity in maize, pea, bean, and rice. To better understand the function of the GS gene under Cd stress in rice, we constructed a recombinant pART vector carrying the GS gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and OCS terminator and transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We then investigated GS overexpressing rice lines at the physiological and molecular levels under Cd toxicity and abiotic stress conditions. We observed a decrease in GS enzyme activity and mRNA expression among transgenic and wild-type plants subjected to Cd stress. The decrease, however, was significantly lower in the wild type than in the transgenic plants. This was further validated by the high GS mRNA expression and enzyme activity in most of the transgenic lines. Moreover, after 10 days of exposure to Cd stress, increase in the glutamine reductase activity and low or no malondialdehyde contents were observed. These results showed that overexpression of the GS gene in rice modulated the expression of enzymes responsible for membrane peroxidation that may result in plant death.
23780733	Isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L.) E3-ubiquitin ligase OsHOS1 gene in the modulation of cold stress response.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	Plants can cope with adverse environmental conditions through the activation of stress response signalling pathways, in which the proteasome seems to play an important role. However, the mechanisms underlying the proteasome-mediated stress response in rice are still not fully understood. To address this issue, we have identified a rice E3-ubiquitin ligase, OsHOS1, and characterized its role in the modulation of the cold stress response. Using a RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic approach we found that, under cold conditions, the RNAi::OsHOS1 plants showed a higher expression level of OsDREB1A. This was correlated with an increased amount of OsICE1, a master transcription factor of the cold stress signalling. However, the up-regulation of OsDREB1A was transient and the transgenic plants did not show increased cold tolerance. Nevertheless, we could confirm the interaction of OsHOS1 with OsICE1 by Yeast-Two hybrid and bi-molecular fluorescence complementation in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Moreover, we could also determine through an in vitro degradation assay that the higher amount of OsICE1 in the transgenic plants was correlated with a lower amount of OsHOS1. Hence, we could confirm the involvement of the proteasome in this response mechanism. Taken together our results confirm the importance of OsHOS1, and thus of the proteasome, in the modulation of the cold stress signalling in rice.
23732981	De novo methyltransferase, OsDRM2, interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, OseIF4A, in rice.	2013	J Mol Biol	Domains rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are the de novo methyltransferases that regulate cytosine methylation in plants in a manner similar to the animal de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b. These enzymes catalyze the establishment of new methylation patterns and are guided to target sites by small RNAs through the process of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In the current accepted view for RdDM, intricate interactions among transcription factors/chromatin modifying proteins and the large subunits of plant-specific polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, regulate the 24-nt small interfering RNA guided de novo methylation of cytosines. The RNA-induced silencing complex assembled on Pol-V-transcribed non-coding RNA finally facilitates the recruitment of DRM2 by unknown mechanism/protein interactions to chromatin sites. In an attempt to determine the cellular proteins that specifically interact with DRM2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using young rice panicles. We report that rice DRM2 interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, eIF4A. Direct interaction between the two proteins is demonstrated in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation method and in vitro by histidine-pull-down assays. Deletion analysis reveals that interaction between OsDRM2 and OseIF4A is specifically mediated through ubiquitin-associated domain of OsDRM2 while, both domains 1 and 2 of OseIF4A are critical for mediating strong interaction with OsDRM2 in vivo. Interaction between Arabidopsis eIF4AI and eIF4AII with OsDRM2 and nuclear localization of these complexes suggests possible conservation of functional interaction between de novo methyltransferases and the translation initiation factor, eIF4A, in RdDM across plant species.
23793979	Molecular characterization and functional analysis of "fruit-weight 2.2-like" gene family in rice.	2013	Planta	Tomato fruit-weight 2.2 (FW2.2) was reported to control up to 30 % fruit weight. Recent studies demonstrated that FW2.2-like (FWL) genes also play important roles in plant growth and development. For instance, a maize homolog of FW2.2, named cell number regulator 1 (CNR1), negatively regulates plant and organ size. However, FWL genes in rice have not been characterized yet. In this study, eight FWL genes were identified in rice genome and designated as OsFWL1-8. The chromosome location, gene structure, protein motif, and phylogenetic relationship of OsFWL genes were analyzed. RT-PCR result and microarray data revealed that OsFWL genes exhibited diverse expression patterns and the detailed expression patterns of OsFWL5, 6, and 7 negatively correlated with leaf growth activity. Rice protoplast transient transformation experiment showed that most OsFWL proteins locate at cell membrane but OsFWL8 is present in the nucleus. In addition, the functions of OsFWL genes were investigated by analyzing two T-DNA insertion lines for OsFWL3 and 5. Compared with wild type, the grain weight of osfwl3 mutant and the plant height of osfwl5 mutant were increased by 5.3 and 12.5 %, respectively. We also found that the increase in grain length of osfwl3 mutant was due chiefly to incremental cell number, not cell size and the expression of OsFWL3 negatively correlated with glume growth activity. These results provide a comprehensive foundation for further study of OsFWL functions in rice.
23808500	OsSUV3 dual helicase functions in salinity stress tolerance by maintaining photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR64).	2013	Plant J	To overcome the salinity-induced loss of crop yield, a salinity-tolerant trait is required. The SUV3 helicase is involved in the regulation of RNA surveillance and turnover in mitochondria, but the helicase activity of plant SUV3 and its role in abiotic stress tolerance have not been reported so far. Here we report that the Oryza sativa (rice) SUV3 protein exhibits DNA and RNA helicase, and ATPase activities. Furthermore, we report that SUV3 is induced in rice seedlings in response to high levels of salt. Its expression, driven by a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in IR64 transgenic rice plants, confers salinity tolerance. The T1 and T2 sense transgenic lines showed tolerance to high salinity and fully matured without any loss in yields. The T2 transgenic lines also showed tolerance to drought stress. These results suggest that the introduced trait is functional and stable in transgenic rice plants. The rice SUV3 sense transgenic lines showed lesser lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and H2 O2 production, along with higher activities of antioxidant enzymes under salinity stress, as compared with wild type, vector control and antisense transgenic lines. These results suggest the existence of an efficient antioxidant defence system to cope with salinity-induced oxidative damage. Overall, this study reports that plant SUV3 exhibits DNA and RNA helicase and ATPase activities, and provides direct evidence of its function in imparting salinity stress tolerance without yield loss. The possible mechanism could be that OsSUV3 helicase functions in salinity stress tolerance by improving photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery in transgenic rice.
23748776	Biosynthesis of phytoalexins and regulatory mechanisms of it in rice.	2013	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	We performed extensive functional characterization of diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes in rice, and found that the genes for the biosynthesis of the major diterpenoid phytoalexins, phytocassanes and momilactones, are clustered on chromosomes 2 and 4, and that their expression is coordinately induced in rice cells after elicitation. Isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of diterpenoid phytoalexins, was found to be synthesized through the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate pathway. We also found that chitin elicitor receptor kinase OsCERK1 and a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, the OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade, play essential roles in the elicitor-induced production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. In addition, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, was identified as a key regulator of the coordinated expression of the clustered genes and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway genes. Naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (OsNOMT) was also identified as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of another major rice phytoalexin, sakuranetin.
23086454	A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice.	2013	Mol Biotechnol	Type 2C protein phosphatase plays an important role in the signal transduction of stress response in plants. In this paper, we identified a novel stress-induced type 2C protein phosphatase gene OsSIPP2C1 from rice. OsSIPP2C1 contains a complete open reading frame of 1,074 bp, encoding a protein with 357 amino acids. OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition. Interestingly, OsSIPP2C1 expression was increased during the early panicle development. Subcellular localization assay using rice protoplast cells indicated that OsSIPP2C1 was predominantly located in the nucleus. Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice.
23979891	Variation of the OsGI intron and its phenotypic associations in Oryza rufipogon Griff. and Oryza sativa L.	2013	Genet Mol Res	We analyzed intron 9 of the OsGI gene in Oryza rufipogon and Oryza sativa in order to investigate evolutionary relationships in rice and the relationship between intron variation and phenotype. OsGI-9 was cloned in 38 O. rufipogon populations and in 139 O. sativa cultivars and the phylogeny was reconstructed. Seed cold tolerance and dormancy were quantified in O. sativa. Three OsGI-9 band types occurred in O. rufipogon: S-type (1.2 kb), F-type (0.9 kb), and FS-type (1.2 and 0.9 kb), whereas only the S-type and F-type occurred in O. sativa. The S-type contains two 255-bp repeats, the F-type contains one 255-bp repeat, and the FS-type contains both. All individuals could be divided into 5 groups in the organism's phylogenetic network: S-type O. rufipogon, F-type O. rufipogon, FS-type O. rufipogon, S-type O. sativa, and F-type O. sativa. F-type O. sativa are most closely related to F-type O. rufipogon and S-type O. sativa are most closely related to S-type O. rufipogon. Statistical analysis indicated that OsGI-9 type is significantly correlated with phenotype; most S-type O. sativa have strong seed dormancy and cold tolerance, and most F-type O. sativa have no seed dormancy and poor cold tolerance.
23846875	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.	2013	J Exp Bot	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
23855375	MULTIPASS, a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, regulates adaptive growth by integrating multiple hormonal pathways.	2013	Plant J	Growth regulation is an important aspect of plant adaptation during environmental perturbations. Here, the role of MULTIPASS (OsMPS), an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor of rice, was explored. OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues. Over-expression of OsMPS reduces growth under non-stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass. OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid and cytokinin, but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide. Growth retardation caused by OsMPS over-expression is partially restored by auxin application. Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP) and cell-wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes. Furthermore, the expression of OsMPS-dependent genes is regulated by auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid. Moreover, we show that OsMPS is a direct upstream regulator of OsEXPA4, OsEXPA8, OsEXPB2, OsEXPB3, OsEXPB6 and the endoglucanase genes OsGLU5 and OsGLU14. The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross-talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate adaptive growth.
23683934	The mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is essential for H2O2 homeostasis and root and shoot development in rice.	2013	Plant Sci	Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases (GPXs: EC 1.11.1.9 and EC1.11.1.12) are non-heme thiol peroxidases that catalyze the reduction of H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides to water, and they have been identified in almost all kingdoms of life. The rice glutathione peroxidase (OsGPX) gene family is comprised of 5 members spread throughout a range of sub cellular compartments. The OsGPX gene family is induced in response to exogenous H2O2 and cold stress. In contrast, they are down regulated in response to drought and UV-B light treatments. Transgenic rice plants have been generated that lack mitochondrial OsGPX3. These GPX3s plants showed shorter roots and shoots compared to non-transformed (NT) plants, and higher amounts of H2O2 mitochondrial release were observed in the roots of these plants cultivated under normal conditions. This accumulation of H2O2 is positively associated with shorter root length in GPX3s plants compared to NT ones. Moreover, GPX3 promoter analysis indicated that it is mainly expressed in root tissue. These results suggest that silencing the mitochondrial OsGPX3 gene impairs normal plant development and leads to a stress-induced morphogenic response via H2O2 accumulation.
23809026	Rice oxalate oxidase gene driven by green tissue-specific promoter increases tolerance to sheath blight pathogen (Rhizoctonia solani) in transgenic rice.	2013	Mol Plant Pathol	Rice sheath blight, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most devastating and intractable diseases of rice, leading to a significant reduction in rice productivity worldwide. In this article, in order to examine sheath blight resistance, we report the generation of transgenic rice lines overexpressing the rice oxalate oxidase 4 (Osoxo4) gene in a green tissue-specific manner which breaks down oxalic acid (OA), the pathogenesis factor secreted by R. solani. Transgenic plants showed higher enzyme activity of oxalate oxidase (OxO) than nontransgenic control plants, which was visualized by histochemical assays and sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Transgenic rice leaves were more tolerant than control rice leaves to exogenous OA. Transgenic plants showed a higher level of expression of other defence-related genes in response to pathogen infection. More importantly, transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced durable resistance to R. solani. The overexpression of Osoxo4 in rice did not show any detrimental phenotypic or agronomic effect. Our findings indicate that rice OxO can be utilized effectively in plant genetic manipulation for sheath blight resistance, and possibly for resistance to other diseases caused by necrotrophic fungi, especially those that secrete OA. This is the first report of the expression of defence genes in rice in a green tissue-specific manner for sheath blight resistance.
23884108	Genetic control of inflorescence architecture during rice domestication.	2013	Nat Commun	Inflorescence architecture is a key agronomical factor determining grain yield, and thus has been a major target of cereal crop domestication. Transition from a spread panicle typical of ancestral wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) to the compact panicle of present cultivars (O. sativa L.) was a crucial event in rice domestication. Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development. Association analysis indicates that a single-nucleotide polymorphism-6 in the OsLG1 regulatory region led to a compact panicle architecture in cultivars during rice domestication. We speculate that the cis-regulatory mutation can fine-tune the spatial expression of the target gene, and that selection of cis-regulatory mutations might be an efficient strategy for crop domestication.
23873084	Overexpression of microRNA OsmiR397 improves rice yield by increasing grain size and promoting panicle branching.	2013	Nat Biotechnol	Increasing grain yields is a major focus of crop breeders around the world. Here we report that overexpression of the rice microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR397, which is naturally highly expressed in young panicles and grains, enlarges grain size and promotes panicle branching, leading to an increase in overall grain yield of up to 25% in a field trial. To our knowledge, no previous report has shown a positive regulatory role of miRNA in the control of plant seed size and grain yield. We determined that OsmiR397 increases grain yield by downregulating its target, OsLAC, whose product is a laccase-like protein that we found to be involved in the sensitivity of plants to brassinosteroids. As miR397 is highly conserved across different species, our results suggest that manipulating miR397 may be useful for increasing grain yield not only in rice but also in other cereal crops.
23869567	Putative osmosensor--OsHK3b--a histidine kinase protein from rice shows high structural conservation with its ortholog AtHK1 from Arabidopsis.	2014	J Biomol Struct Dyn	Prokaryotes and eukaryotes respond to various environmental stimuli using the two-component system (TCS). Essentially, it consists of membrane-bound histidine kinase (HK) which senses the stimuli and further transfers the signal to the response regulator, which in turn, regulates expression of various target genes. Recently, sequence-based genome wide analysis has been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice to identify all the putative members of TCS family. One of the members of this family i.e. AtHK1, (a putative osmosensor, hybrid-type sensory histidine kinase) is known to interact with AtHPt1 (phosphotransfer proteins) in Arabidopsis. Based on predicted rice interactome network (PRIN), the ortholog of AtHK1 in rice, OsHK3b, was found to be interacting with OsHPt2. The analysis of amino acid sequence of AtHK1 showed the presence of transmitter domain (TD) and receiver domain (RD), while OsHK3b showed presence of three conserved domains namely CHASE (signaling domain), TD, and RD. In order to elaborate on structural details of functional domains of hybrid-type HK and phosphotransfer proteins in both these genera, we have modeled them using homology modeling approach. The structural motifs present in various functional domains of the orthologous proteins were found to be highly conserved. Binding analysis of the RD domain of these sensory proteins in Arabidopsis and rice revealed the role of various residues such as histidine in HPt protein which are essential for their interaction.
23852542	Genome-wide expression analysis of HSP70 family genes in rice and identification of a cytosolic HSP70 gene highly induced under heat stress.	2013	Funct Integr Genomics	The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene family plays a key role in protecting plant cells or tissues from thermal or oxidative stress. Although many studies have elucidated the molecular functions of individual family members, genome-wide analysis of this family is still limited, especially for crop species. Our objective was to integrate various meta-profiling data into the context of a phylogenetic tree, which would enable us to perform fine evaluation of functional dominancy or redundancy within this family. Our data indicated that a loss-of-function mutant of a rice cytosolic HSP70 gene (OsctHSP70-1) did not show a clear defective phenotype in response to high temperature because of the existence of another gene family member that was closely clustered with OsctHSP70-1 and had similar expression patterns. Moreover, the second gene showed much stronger anatomical expression. We indirectly analyzed the function of OsctHSP70-1 by studying GUS activity under the control of the endogenous promoter. We also designed a probable interaction network mediated by OsctHSP70-1 and used co-expression analysis among its components to refine the network, suggesting more probable model to explain the function of OsctHSP70-1.
23893219	Coexpression patterns indicate that GPI-anchored non-specific lipid transfer proteins are involved in accumulation of cuticular wax, suberin and sporopollenin.	2013	Plant Mol Biol	The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTP) are unique to land plants. The nsLTPs are characterized by a compact structure with a central hydrophobic cavity and can be classified to different types based on sequence similarity, intron position or spacing between the cysteine residues. The type G nsLTPs (LTPGs) have a GPI-anchor in the C-terminal region which attaches the protein to the exterior side of the plasma membrane. The function of these proteins, which are encoded by large gene families, has not been systematically investigated so far. In this study we have explored microarray data to investigate the expression pattern of the LTPGs in Arabidopsis and rice. We identified that the LTPG genes in each plant can be arranged in three expression modules with significant coexpression within the modules. According to expression patterns and module sizes, the Arabidopsis module AtI is functionally equivalent to the rice module OsI, AtII corresponds to OsII and AtIII is functionally comparable to OsIII. Starting from modules AtI, AtII and AtIII we generated extended networks with Arabidopsis genes coexpressed with the modules. Gene ontology analyses of the obtained networks suggest roles for LTPGs in the synthesis or deposition of cuticular waxes, suberin and sporopollenin. The AtI-module is primarily involved with cuticular wax, the AtII-module with suberin and the AtIII-module with sporopollenin. Further transcript analysis revealed that several transcript forms exist for several of the LTPG genes in both Arabidopsis and rice. The data suggests that the GPI-anchor attachment and localization of LTPGs may be controlled to some extent by alternative splicing.
23894405	RNAi-directed downregulation of vacuolar H(+) -ATPase subunit a results in enhanced stomatal aperture and density in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Stomatal movement plays a key role in plant development and response to drought and salt stress by regulating gas exchange and water loss. A number of genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of this process. Using inverse genetics approach, we characterized the function of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A (OsVHA-A) gene in stomatal conductance regulation and physiological response to salt and osmotic stress. OsVHA-A was constitutively expressed in different rice tissues, and the fusion protein of GFP-OsVHA-A was exclusively targeted to tonoplast when transiently expressed in the onion epidermal cells. Heterologous expression of OsVHA-A was able to rescue the yeast mutant vma1Δ (lacking subunit A activity) phenotype, suggesting that it partially restores the activity of V-ATPase. Meanwhile, RNAi-directed knockdown of OsVHA-A led to a reduction of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity and an enhancement of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity, thereby increasing the concentrations of extracellular H(+) and intracellular K(+) and Na(+) under stress conditions. Knockdown of OsVHA-A also resulted in the upregulation of PAM3 (plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase 3) and downregulation of CAM1 (calmodulin 1), CAM3 (calmodulin 3) and YDA1 (YODA, a MAPKK gene). Altered level of the ion concentration and the gene expression by knockdown of OsVHA-A probably resulted in expanded aperture of stomatal pores and increased stomatal density. In addition, OsVHA-A RNAi plants displayed significant growth inhibition under salt and osmotic stress conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that OsVHA-A takes part in regulating stomatal density and opening via interfering with pH value and ionic equilibrium in guard cells and thereby affects the growth of rice plants.
23926064	Expression and functional analysis of the CorA-MRS2-ALR-type magnesium transporter family in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Maintenance of an appropriate magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) concentration is essential for plant growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the CorA-MRS2-ALR-type proteins, named MRS2/MGT family proteins, are reportedly localized in various membranes and they function in Mg transport. However, knowledge of this family in other plant species is extremely limited. Furthermore, differential diversification among dicot and monocot plants suggested by phylogenetic analysis indicates that the role of the Arabidopsis MRS2/MGT family proteins is not the same in monocot plants. For a further understanding of this family in higher plants, functional analysis and gene expression profiling of rice MRS2/MGT family members were performed. A phylogenetic tree based on the isolated mRNA sequences of nine members of the OsMRS2 family confirmed that the MRS2/MGT family consists of five clades (A-E). A complementation assay in the yeast CM66 strain showed that four of the nine members possessed the Mg(2+) transport ability. Transient green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the isolated rice protoplast indicated that OsMRS2-5 and OsMRS2-6, belonging to clades D and A, respectively, localized in the chloroplast. Expression levels of these genes were low in the unexpanded yellow-green leaf, but increased considerably with leaf maturation. In addition, diurnal oscillation of expression was observed, particularly in OsMRS2-6 expression in the expanded leaf blade. We conclude that OsMRS2 family members function as Mg transporters and suggest that the genes belonging to clade A encode the chloroplast-localized Mg(2+) transporter in plants.
23980801	Production of indole alkaloids by metabolic engineering of the tryptophan pathway in rice.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) converts tryptophan (Trp) into tryptamine, consequently increasing the metabolic flow of tryptophan derivatives into the production of secondary metabolites such as indole alkaloids. We inserted an expression cassette containing OsTDC, a putative tryptophan decarboxylase gene from rice, into an expression plasmid vector containing OASA1D, the feedback-resistant anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit mutant (OASA1D). Overexpression of OASA1D has been reported to significantly increase Trp levels in rice. The co-expression of OsTDC and OASA1D in rice calli led to almost complete depletion of the Trp pool and a consequent increase in the tryptamine pool. This indicates that TDC inactivity is a contributory factor for the accumulation of Trp in rice transgenics overexpressing OASA1D. Metabolic profiling of the calli expressing OsTDC and OASA1D revealed the accumulation of serotonin and serotonin-derived indole compounds (potentially pharmacoactive β-carbolines) that have not been reported from rice. Rice calli overexpressing OASA1D:OASA1D is a novel system for the production of significant amounts of pharmacologically useful indole alkaloids in rice.
23918968	OsAP65, a rice aspartic protease, is essential for male fertility and plays a role in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.	2013	J Exp Bot	Aspartic proteases (APs) comprise a large proteolytic enzyme family widely distributed in animals, microbes, viruses, and plants. The rice genome encodes 96 APs, of which only a few have been functionally characterized. Here, the identification and characterization of a novel AP gene, OsAP65, which plays an indispensable role in pollen tube growth in rice, is reported. The T-DNA insertion line of OsAP65 caused severe segregation distortion. In the progeny derived from an individual heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion, the wild type and T-DNA-carrying heterozygote segregated at a ratio close to 1:1, while homozygotes of disrupted OsAP65 (OsAP65-/-) were not recovered. Reciprocal crosses between heterozygotes and wild-type plants demonstrated that the mutant alleles could not be transmitted through the male gamete. Examination of the anthers from heterozygous plants revealed that the mutant pollen matured normally, but did not germinate or elongate. OsAP65 was expressed in various tissues and the transcript level in heterozygous plants was about half of the amount measured in the wild-type plants. The subcellular localization showed that OsAP65 is a pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) protein. These results indicated that OsAP65 was essential for rice pollen germination and tube growth.
23924074	Identification and characterization of OsEBS, a gene involved in enhanced plant biomass and spikelet number in rice.	2013	Plant Biotechnol J	Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is an important genetic reservoir for rice improvement. We investigated a quantitative trait locus (QTL), qGP5-1, which is related to plant height, leaf size and panicle architecture, using a set of introgression lines of O. rufipogon in the background of the Indica cultivar Guichao2 (Oryza sativa L.). We cloned and characterized qGP5-1 and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an increase in total grain yield per plant. Our results showed that the increased size of vegetative organs in OsEBS-expressed plants was enormously caused by increasing cell number. Sequence alignment showed that OsEBS protein contains a region with high similarity to the N-terminal conserved ATPase domain of Hsp70, but it lacks the C-terminal regions of the peptide-binding domain and the C-terminal lid. More results indicated that OsEBS gene did not have typical characteristics of Hsp70 in this study. Furthermore, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transformed with OsEBS showed a similar phenotype to OsEBS-transgenic rice, indicating a conserved function of OsEBS among plant species. Together, we report the cloning and characterization of OsEBS, a new QTL that controls rice biomass and spikelet number, through map-based cloning, and it may have utility in improving grain yield in rice.
23949687	Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice.	2013	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, ABA and PEG treatments. Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by OsHsfB2b overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference.

ABSTRACT: Plants have more than 20 heat shock factors (Hsfs) that were designated class A, B, and C. Many members of Class A Hsfs were characterized as activators of transcription, but the functional roles of class B and C Hsfs have not been fully recognized. OsHsfB2b is a member of class B Hsfs in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress. Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased in OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice, but were enhanced in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice. Under drought stress, the OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice exhibited increased relative electrical conductivity (REC) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased proline content compared with the wild type, while the lower REC and MDA content and increased proline content were found in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice. These results suggest that OsHsfB2b functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity. The present study revealed the potential value of OsHsfB2b in genetic improvement of rice.
23918260	OsbZIP71, a bZIP transcription factor, confers salinity and drought tolerance in rice.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	The bZIP transcription factor (TF) family plays an important role in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway of abiotic stress in plants. We here report the cloning and characterization of OsbZIP71, which encodes a rice bZIP TF. Functional analysis showed that OsbZIP71 is a nuclear-localized protein that specifically binds to the G-box motif, but has no transcriptional activity both in yeast and rice protoplasts. In yeast two-hybrid assays, OsbZIP71 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with Group C members of the bZIP gene family. Expression of OsbZIP71 was strongly induced by drought, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ABA treatments, but repressed by salt treatment. OsbZIP71 overexpressing (p35S::OsbZIP71) rice significantly improved tolerance to drought, salt and PEG osmotic stresses. In contrast, RNAi knockdown transgenic lines were much more sensitive to salt, PEG osmotic stresses, and also ABA treatment. Inducible expression (RD29A::OsbZIP71) lines were significantly improved their tolerance to PEG osmotic stresses, but hypersensitivity to salt, and insensitivity to ABA. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the abiotic stress-related genes, OsVHA-B, OsNHX1, COR413-TM1, and OsMyb4, were up-regulated in overexpressing lines, while these same genes were down-regulated in RNAi lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that OsbZIP71 directly binds the promoters of OsNHX1 and COR413-TM1 in vivo. These results suggest that OsbZIP71 may play an important role in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerance in rice.
23707881	Exogenous application of brassinosteroid offers tolerance to salinity by altering stress responses in rice variety Pusa Basmati-1.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids, play a pivotal role in variety of plant developmental processes and adaptation to various environmental stresses. The present work investigates the response of various stress markers upon exogenous application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) on Pusa Basmati-1, a commercially important rice variety, under salt stress conditions. Rice seeds after treatment with different concentrations of NaCl alone or in combination with different concentrations of 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) were analysed for various growth parameters, protein, proline and malondialdehyde content (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities. The seedlings exposed to NaCl exhibited a significant decline in growth parameters and changes in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, however, treatment with EBL showed an improvement in growth, levels of protein and proline content and antioxidant enzymes activity. The enhanced levels of MDA content during salt stress in rice seedlings was decreased with EBL treatment. Further, the treatment with EBL increased the expression of various oxidative stress marker genes, although to different levels. Expression of various brassinosteroids (OsBRI1, OsDWF4) and salt (SalT) responsive genes, revealed the down regulation of OsDWF4 with application of EBL and upregulation of SalT in presence of salt stress thereby confirming the efficacy of the treatments. Interestingly, a significant down regulation of SalT gene was observed on application of EBL along with salt compared to salt treatment alone. On the other hand, the application of EBL alone and in combination with salt has resulted in upregulation of OsBRI1.
23927868	Early signaling network in rice PRR-mediated and R-mediated immunity.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Recent studies on plant immunity and pathogen infection have revealed sophisticated forms of plant-pathogen interaction. Considerable progress has been made recently in our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying chitin signaling in rice. The identification and characterization of two direct substrates, OsRacGEF1 and OsRLCK185, as components in the chitin receptor complex of OsCERK1 have revealed how pattern recognition receptors transduce pathogen signals to downstream molecules in rice. In this review, we highlight these and other recent studies that have contributed to our current understanding of the signaling network in rice immunity, especially with regard to pattern recognition receptors, disease resistance (R) proteins, and their downstream targets.
23944972	Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis.	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	We have isolated a severe dwarf mutant derived from a Ds (Dissociation) insertion mutant rice (Oryza sativa var. japonica c.v. Dongjin). This severe dwarf phenotype, has short and dark green leaves, reduced shoot growth early in the seedling stage, and later severe dwarfism with failure to initiate flowering. When treated with bioactive GA3 , mutants are restored to the normal wild-type phenotype. Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene. Genetic analysis revealed that the severe dwarf phenotype was controlled by recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. The putative OsKS2 gene was a chromosome 4-located ent-kaurene synthase (KS), encoding the enzyme that catalyses an early step of the GA biosynthesis pathway. Sequence analysis revealed that osks2 carried a 1-bp deletion in the ORF region of OsKS2, which led to a loss-of-function mutation. The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs. Morphological characteristics of the dwarf mutant showed dramatic modifications in internal structure and external morphology. We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants. Further investigation on OsKS2 and other OsKS-like proteins is underway and may yield better understanding of the putative role of OsKS in severe dwarf mutants.
23918184	Modified expression of an auxin-responsive rice CC-type glutaredoxin gene affects multiple abiotic stress responses.	2013	Planta	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are the ubiquitous oxidoreductase enzymes, which play an important role in defense against various stresses. Here, we report the role of a CC-type GRX gene from rice, OsGRX8, in abiotic stress tolerance. OsGRX8 protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin. The over-expression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid. In addition, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibited enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including salinity, osmotic and oxidative stress. Further, the transgenic RNAi rice plants exhibited increased susceptibility to various abiotic stresses, which further confirmed the role of OsGRX8 in abiotic stress responses. The microarray data analysis revealed that expression of a large number of auxin-responsive, known stress-associated and transcription factor encoding genes was altered in GRX transgenic Arabidopsis plants in response to exogenous auxin and stress conditions as compared to wild-type plants. Altogether, these findings suggest the role of OsGRX8 in regulating abiotic stress response and may be used to engineer stress tolerance in crop plants.
23963678	Mn tolerance in rice is mediated by MTP8.1, a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family.	2013	J Exp Bot	Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient for plants, but is toxic when present in excess. The rice plant (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates high concentrations of Mn in the aerial parts; however, the molecular basis for Mn tolerance is poorly understood. In the present study, genes encoding Mn tolerance were screened for by expressing cDNAs of genes from rice shoots in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A gene encoding a cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family member, OsMTP8.1, was isolated, and its expression was found to enhance Mn accumulation and tolerance in S. cerevisiae. In plants, OsMTP8.1 and its transcript were mainly detected in shoots. High or low supply of Mn moderately induced an increase or decrease in the accumulation of OsMTP8.1, respectively. OsMTP8.1 was detected in all cells of leaf blades through immunohistochemistry. OsMTP8.1 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to the tonoplast. Disruption of OsMTP8.1 resulted in decreased chlorophyll levels, growth inhibition in the presence of high concentrations of Mn, and decreased accumulation of Mn in shoots and roots. However, there was no difference in the accumulation of other metals, including Zn, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ca, and K. These results suggest that OsMTP8.1 is an Mn-specific transporter that sequesters Mn into vacuoles in rice and is required for Mn tolerance in shoots.
23907515	The rice OsLTP6 gene promoter directs anther-specific expression by a combination of positive and negative regulatory elements.	2013	Planta	Characterization of tissue-specific plant gene promoters will benefit genetic improvement in crops. Here, we isolated a novel rice anther-specific plant lipid transfer protein (OsLTP6) gene through high through-put expressional profiling. The promoter of OsLTP6 was introduced to the upstream of the uidA gene, which encodes β-glucuronidase (GUS), and transformed into rice plants for functional analysis. Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assay showed that GUS was specifically expressed in the anthers and pollens in OsLTP6 promoter::uidA transgenic plants. Transverse section of the rice anther further indicated that the OsLTP6 promoter directed the reporter gene specifically expressed in anther tapetum. To identify regulatory elements within OsLTP6 promoter region, four progressive deletions of the OsLTP6 promoter were constructed. The results indicated that the OsLTP6 promoter achieved anther-specific expression through a combination of positive and negative regulatory elements. A 26-bp motif upstream of TATA box was a key transcriptional activator for OsLTP6 gene. CAAT box and GTGA box were the putative motifs to increase the transcription level to full expression. Two negative regulatory elements were also found in two distinct regions within this promoter. They repressed the expression in leaf and stem, respectively. These results revealed the regulating complexity of anther-specific expression.
23967316	Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells.	2013	PLoS One	Potassium is the most abundant cation and a myriad of transporters regulate K(+) homeostasis in plant. Potassium plays a role as a major osmolyte to regulate stomatal movements that control water utility of land plants. Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants. While OsKAT2 showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins. Interestingly, the two potassium channels physically interacted with each other and such interaction negatively regulated the OsKAT2 channel activity in CHO cell system. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal domain recovered the channel activity of OsKAT3, suggesting that the C-terminal region was regulatory domain that inhibited channel activity. Two homologous channels with antagonistic interaction has not been previously reported and presents new information for potassium channel regulation in plants, especially in stomatal regulation.
23895290	Plant omics: genome-wide analysis of ABA repressor1 (ABR1) related genes in rice during abiotic stress and development.	2013	OMICS	Rice is one of the world's most important food crops. Approximately 50% of rice production is affected by drought, an abiotic stress greatly impacting crop quality and yield. Agrigenomics research now offers the promise of understanding the drought stress impacts at a systems level. ABA repressor 1 (ABR1) is a member of the ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF/AP2) superfamily of ERF transcription factors. We report here a global expression analysis of the rice ABR1-related genes where we identified the expression pattern of each Oryza sativa ERF (OsERF) during various developmental stages and abiotic stress treatments. The group X OsERFs, closely related genes orthologous to ABR1, exhibited significant differential expression profiles during certain stages of development and in response to abiotic stresses. We selected a subset of these genes and validated their observed expression profiles in response to abiotic stresses using quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we discovered that pairs of recently duplicated group X OsERFs display highly distinct expression profiles from one another. We determined the subcellular localization of two group X OsERF genes and observed localization to the nucleolus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of localization of rice ERF protein to the nucleolus. This study also points out an overlap of expression under abiotic stress and reproductive developmental stages, indicating cross talk among different signaling pathways. This genome-wide expression analysis of rice ABR1 homologs paves the way for future functional analyses, with the goal to develop strategies to improve rice abiotic stress tolerance.
23918959	TaCPK2-A, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene that is required for wheat powdery mildew resistance enhances bacterial blight resistance in transgenic rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are important Ca2+ signalling components involved in complex immune and stress signalling networks; but the knowledge of CPK gene functions in the hexaploid wheat is limited. Previously, TaCPK2 was shown to be inducible by powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici, Bgt) infection in wheat. Here, its functions in disease resistance are characterized further. This study shows the presence of defence-response and cold-response cis-elements on the promoters of the A subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-A) and D subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-D), respectively. Their expression patterns were then confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using genome-specific primers, where TaCPK2-A was induced by Bgt treatment while TaCPK2-D mainly responded to cold treatment. Downregulation of TaCPK2-A by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) causes loss of resistance to Bgt in resistant wheat lines, indicating that TaCPK2-A is required for powdery mildew resistance. Furthermore, overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice enhanced bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo) resistance. qRT-PCR analysis showed that overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice promoted the expression of OsWRKY45-1, a transcription factor involved in both fungal and bacterial resistance by regulating jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling genes. The opposite effect was found in wheat TaCPK2-A VIGS plants, where the homologue of OsWRKY45-1 was significantly repressed. These data suggest that modulation of WRKY45-1 and associated defence-response genes by CPK2 genes may be the common mechanism for multiple disease resistance in grass species, which may have undergone subfunctionalization in promoters before the formation of hexaploid wheat.
19034497	Comprehensive expression profiling analysis of OsIAA gene family in developmental processes and in response to phytohormone and stress treatments.	2009	Planta	Auxin is one of the most important phytohormones and exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. Aux/IAA and auxin response factor (ARF) are two important protein families that are well recognized for their roles in auxin-mediated responses. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional regulators that mediate auxin responses through interaction with ARF transcription factors. Here, we systematically compared the genomic organization of the two families in rice. The expression profiles of both families were compared to show possible association of the two gene families at expression level, which would help reveal their synergistic relationships and functions. The expression profile analysis of Aux/IAA and ARF genes in 30 organs/tissues (collected from an entire life cycle of rice) suggested that Aux/IAA and ARF genes are expressed in very diverse patterns. In general, the genes showing similar expression patterns tended to be in the same phylogenetic subgroup even though their expression patterns were not always the same. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that there are eight pairs of IAA and ARF genes, with each pair showing highly correlated expression. The expression levels of the IAA gene family were also checked under various hormone treatments including abscisic acid, kinetin, gibberellin, jasmonic acid, auxin and brassinolide. The results indicated that most of the IAA genes respond to at least one of the treatments. Furthermore, DNA chip and real-time PCR results show that many genes in these families were responsive to various abiotic stresses, indicating an interaction between plant growth and abiotic stress. The effect of abiotic stress on plant growth and auxin distribution was further confirmed with the root growth of DR5-GUS transgenic rice under mannitol treatment, in which a close association between mannitol-induced changes of auxin distribution and root growth was observed.
19888828	Overexpression of rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsCDR1 leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice and Arabidopsis.	2009	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plant aspartic proteases (AP) play key roles in the regulation of biological processes, such as the recognition of pathogens and pests and the induction of effective defense responses. A large number of AP (>400) have been identified in silico in the rice genome. None have previously been isolated and functionally characterized for their involvement in disease resistance. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a gene (OsCDR1) from rice which encodes a predicted aspartate protease. Expression of OsCDR1 was activated upon treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are signal molecules in plant disease resistance responses. Ectopic expression of OsCDR1 in Arabidopsis and rice conferred enhanced resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The enhanced disease resistance observed in transgenic plants was correlated with induction of pathogenesis-related gene expression and was shown by mutational analysis to be dependent on AP activity of the transgene-encoded product. OsCDR1 accumulates in intercellular fluids (IF) in transgenic plants. Infiltration of IF from transgenic Arabidopsis plants into leaves of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis induced the systemic defense response. These results demonstrate the conservation of CDR1 function between rice and Arabidopsis during the disease resistance response.
18247056	Characteristic expression of twelve rice PR1 family genes in response to pathogen infection, wounding, and defense-related signal compounds (121/180).	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins have been used as markers of plant defense responses, and are classified into 17 families. However, precise information on the majority members in specific PR families is still limited. We were interested in the individual characteristics of rice PR1 family genes, and selected 12 putatively active genes using rice genome databases for expressed genes. All were upregulated upon compatible and/or incompatible rice-blast fungus interactions; three were upregulated in the early infection period and four in the late infection period. Upon compatible rice-bacterial blight interaction, four genes were upregulated, six were not affected, and one was downregulated. These results are in striking contrast to those among 22 Arabidopsis PR1 genes where only one gene was pathogen-inducible. The responses of individual genes to salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene induced defense signaling pathways in rice are likely to be different from those in dicot plants. Transcript levels in healthy leaves, roots, and flowers varied according to each gene. Analysis of the partially overlapping expression patterns of rice PR1 genes in healthy tissues and in response to pathogens and other stresses would be useful to understand their possible functions and for use as characteristic markers for defense-related studies in rice.
20566579	Rice SUVH histone methyltransferase genes display specific functions in chromatin modification and retrotransposon repression.	2010	Mol Plant	Histone lysine methylation plays an important role in heterochromatin formation and reprogramming of gene expression. SET-domain-containing proteins are shown to have histone lysine methyltransferase activities. A large number of SET-domain genes are identified in plant genomes. The function of most SET-domain genes is not known. In this work, we studied the 12 rice (Oryza sativa) homologs of Su(var)3-9, the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase identified in Drosophila. Several rice SUVHs (i.e. SDG714, SDG727, and SDG710) were found to have an antagonistic function to the histone H3K9 demethylase JMJ706, as down-regulation of these genes could partially complement the jmj706 phenotype and reduced histone H3K9 methylation. Down-regulation of a rice Su(var)3-9 homolog (SUVH), namely SDG728, decreased H3K9 methylation and altered seed morphology. Overexpression of the gene increased H3K9 methylation. SDG728 and other SUVH genes were found to be involved in the repression of retrotransposons such as Tos17 and a Ty1-copia element. Analysis of histone methylation suggested that SDG728-mediated H3K9 methylation may play an important role in retrotransposon repression.
21435223	Structure and evolution of the plant cation diffusion facilitator family of ion transporters.	2011	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: Members of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family are integral membrane divalent cation transporters that transport metal ions out of the cytoplasm either into the extracellular space or into internal compartments such as the vacuole. The spectrum of cations known to be transported by proteins of the CDF family include Zn, Fe, Co, Cd, and Mn. Members of this family have been identified in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea, and in sequenced plant genomes. CDF families range in size from nine members in Selaginella moellendorffii to 19 members in Populus trichocarpa. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the CDF family has expanded within plants, but a definitive plant CDF family phylogeny has not been constructed.

RESULTS: Representative CDF members were annotated from diverse genomes across the Viridiplantae and Rhodophyta lineages and used to identify phylogenetic relationships within the CDF family. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of CDF amino acid sequence data supports organizing land plant CDF family sequences into 7 groups. The origin of the 7 groups predates the emergence of land plants. Among these, 5 of the 7 groups are likely to have originated at the base of the tree of life, and 2 of 7 groups appear to be derived from a duplication event prior to or coincident with land plant evolution. Within land plants, local expansion continues within select groups, while several groups are strictly maintained as one gene copy per genome.

CONCLUSIONS: Defining the CDF gene family phylogeny contributes to our understanding of this family in several ways. First, when embarking upon functional studies of the members, defining primary groups improves the predictive power of functional assignment of orthologous/paralogous genes and aids in hypothesis generation. Second, defining groups will allow a group-specific sequence motif to be generated that will help define future CDF family sequences and aid in functional motif identification, which currently is lacking for this family in plants. Third, the plant-specific expansion resulting in Groups 8 and 9 evolved coincident to the early primary radiation of plants onto land, suggesting these families may have been important for early land colonization.
18616466	Glutathione peroxidase family - an evolutionary overview.	2008	FEBS J	Glutathione peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.9 and EC 1.11.1.12) catalyze the reduction of H(2)O(2) or organic hydroperoxides to water or corresponding alcohols using reduced glutathione. Some glutathione peroxidase isozymes have a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity and present a selenocysteine encoded by the opal TGA codon. In the present study, insights into the evolution of the whole glutathione peroxidase gene family were obtained after a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis using the improved number of glutathione peroxidase sequences recorded in the PeroxiBase database (http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch/index.php). The identification of a common ancestral origin for the diverse glutathione peroxidase clusters was not possible. The complex relationships and evolutionary rates of this gene family suggest that basal glutathione peroxidase classes, present in all kingdoms, have originated from independent evolutionary events such as gene duplication, gene losses, lateral gene transfer among invertebrates and vertebrates or plants. In addition, the present study also emphasizes the possibility of some members being submitted to strong selective forces that probably dictated functional convergences of taxonomically distant groups.
19788421	Rice cytosine DNA methyltransferases - gene expression profiling during reproductive development and abiotic stress.	2009	FEBS J	DNA methylation affects important developmental processes in both plants and animals. The process of methylation of cytosines at C-5 is catalysed by DNA methyltransferases (MTases), which are highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, in eukaryotes. In this study, we identified and characterized cytosine DNA MTase genes that are activated with the onset of reproductive development in rice. The rice genome (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) encodes a total of 10 genes that contain the highly conserved MTase catalytic domain. These genes have been categorized into subfamilies on the basis of phylogenetic relationships. A microarray-based gene expression profile of all 10 MTases during 22 stages/tissues that included 14 stages of reproductive development and five vegetative tissues together with three stresses, cold, salt and dehydration stress, revealed specific windows of MTase activity during panicle and seed development. The expression of six methylases was specifically/preferentially upregulated with the initiation of floral organs. Significantly, one of the MTases was also activated in young seedlings in response to cold and salt stress. The molecular studies presented here suggest a greater role for these proteins and the epigenetic process in affecting genome activity during reproductive development and stress than was previously anticipated.
20088860	Zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding protein in Oryza sativa has an RNA chaperone activity under cold stress conditions.	2010	Plant Cell Environ	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbours three genes encoding CysCysHisCys (CCHC)-type zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins, designated OsRZ proteins, but their importance and physiological functions remain largely unknown. Here, the stress-responsive expression patterns of OsRZs were assessed, and the biological and cellular functions of OsRZs were evaluated under low temperature conditions. The expression levels of the three OsRZs were up-regulated by cold stress, whereas drought or high salt stress did not significantly alter its transcript level. OsRZ2 complemented the cold sensitivity of BX04 Escherichia coli cells under low temperatures, and had DNA-melting activity and transcription anti-termination activity, thereby indicating that OsRZ2 possesses an RNA chaperone activity. By contrast, neither OsRZ1 nor OsRZ3 harboured these activities. Ectopic expression of OsRZ2, but not OsRZ3, in cold-sensitive Arabidopsis grp7 knockout plants rescued the grp7 plants from cold and freezing damage, and OsRZ2 complemented the defect in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in grp7 mutant during cold stress. The present findings support the emerging idea that the regulation of mRNA export is one of the adaptive processes in plants under stress conditions, and RNA chaperone functions as a regulator in mRNA export under cold stress conditions.
15181212	A novel family of cys-rich membrane proteins mediates cadmium resistance in Arabidopsis.	2004	Plant Physiol	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread pollutant that is toxic to plant growth. However, only a few genes that contribute to Cd resistance in plants have been identified. To identify additional Cd(II) resistance genes, we screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression system employing the Cd(II)-sensitive yeast mutant ycf1. This screening process yielded a small Cys-rich membrane protein (Arabidopsis plant cadmium resistance, AtPcrs). Database searches revealed that there are nine close homologs in Arabidopsis. Homologs were also found in other plants. Four of the five homologs that were tested also increased resistance to Cd(II) when expressed in ycf1. AtPcr1 localizes at the plasma membrane in both yeast and Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPcr1 exhibited increased Cd(II) resistance, whereas antisense plants that showed reduced AtPcr1 expression were more sensitive to Cd(II). AtPcr1 overexpression reduced Cd uptake by yeast cells and also reduced the Cd contents of both yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts treated with Cd. Thus, it appears that the Pcr family members may play an important role in the Cd resistance of plants.
21486996	Evolutionary history of the non-specific lipid transfer proteins.	2011	Mol Plant	The non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are small, basic proteins characterized by a tunnel-like hydrophobic cavity, capable of transferring various lipid molecules between lipid bilayers. Most nsLTPs are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that localizes the protein to the apoplastic space. The nsLTPs have only been identified in seed plants, where they are encoded by large gene families. We have initiated an analysis of the evolutionary history of the nsLTP family using genomic and EST information from non-seed land plants and green algae to determine: (1) when the nsLTP family arose, (2) how often new nsLTP subfamilies have been created, and (3) how subfamilies differ in their patterns of expansion and loss in different plant lineages. In this study, we searched sequence databases and found that genes and transcripts encoding nsLTPs are abundant in liverworts, mosses, and all other investigated land plants, but not present in any algae. The tertiary structures of representative liverwort and moss nsLTPs were further studied with homology modeling. The results indicate that the nsLTP family has evolved after plants conquered land. Only two of the four major subfamilies of nsLTPs found in flowering plants are present in mosses and liverworts. The additional subfamilies have arisen later, during land plant evolution. In this report, we also introduce a modified nsLTP classification system.
19825565	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development.	2008	Mol Plant	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
15295114	Lipid binding in rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein-1 complexes from Oryza sativa.	2004	Protein Sci	Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) facilitate the transfer of phospholipids, glycolipids, fatty acids and steroids between membranes, with wide-ranging binding affinities. Three crystal structures of rice nsLTP1 from Oryza sativa, complexed with myristic (MYR), palmitic (PAL) or stearic acid (STE) were determined. The overall structures of the rice nsLTP1 complexes belong to the four-helix bundle folding with a long C-terminal loop. The nsLTP1-MYR and the nsLTP1-STE complexes bind a single fatty acid while the nsLTP1-PAL complex binds two molecules of fatty acids. The C-terminal loop region is elastic in order to accommodate a diverse range of lipid molecules. The lipid molecules interact with the nsLTP1-binding cavity mainly with hydrophobic interactions. Significant conformational changes were observed in the binding cavity and the C-terminal loop of the rice nsLTP1 upon lipid binding.
12011089	Solution structure of plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-2 from rice (Oryza sativa).	2002	J Biol Chem	The three-dimensional structure of rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP2) has been solved for the first time. The structure of nsLTP2 was obtained using 813 distance constraints, 30 hydrogen bond constraints, and 19 dihedral angle constraints. Fifteen of the 50 random simulated annealing structures satisfied all of the constraints and possessed good nonbonded contacts. The novel three-dimensional fold of rice nsLTP2 contains a triangular hydrophobic cavity formed by three prominent helices. The four disulfide bonds required for stabilization of the nsLTP2 structure show a different pattern of cysteine pairing compared with nsLTP1. The C terminus of the protein is very flexible and forms a cap over the hydrophobic cavity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the hydrophobic cavity could accommodate large molecules with rigid structures, such as sterols. The positively charged residues on the molecular surface of nsLTP2 are structurally similar to other plant defense proteins.
21044985	Genome-wide survey and expression analysis suggest diverse roles of glutaredoxin gene family members during development and response to various stimuli in rice.	2010	DNA Res	Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes involved in a variety of cellular processes. In this study, our analysis revealed the presence of 48 genes encoding GRX proteins in the rice genome. GRX proteins could be classified into four classes, namely CC-, CGFS-, CPYC- and GRL-type, based on phylogenetic analysis. The classification was supported with organization of predicted conserved putative motifs in GRX proteins. We found that expansion of this gene family has occurred largely via whole genome duplication events in a species-specific manner. We explored rice oligonucleotide array data to gain insights into the function of GRX gene family members during various stages of development and in response to environmental stimuli. The comprehensive expression analysis suggested diverse roles of GRX genes during growth and development in rice. Some of the GRX genes were expressed in specific organs/developmental stages only. The expression of many of rice GRX genes was influenced by various phytohormones, abiotic and biotic stress conditions, suggesting an important role of GRX proteins in response to these stimuli. The identification of GRX genes showing differential expression in specific tissues or in response to environmental stimuli provide a new avenue for in-depth characterization of selected genes of importance.
20118235	A conserved threonine residue in the juxtamembrane domain of the XA21 pattern recognition receptor is critical for kinase autophosphorylation and XA21-mediated immunity.	2010	J Biol Chem	Despite the key role that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play in regulating immunity in plants and animals, the mechanism of activation of the associated non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinases is unknown. The rice PRR XA21 recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, Ax21 (activator of XA21-mediated immunity). Here we show that the XA21 juxtamembrane (JM) domain is required for kinase autophosphorylation. Threonine 705 in the XA21 JM domain is essential for XA21 autophosphorylation in vitro and XA21-mediated innate immunity in vivo. The replacement of Thr(705) by an alanine or glutamic acid abolishes XA21 autophosphorylation and eliminates interactions between XA21 and four XA21-binding proteins in yeast and rice. Although threonine residues analogous to Thr(705) of XA21 are present in the JM domains of most RD and non-RD plant receptor-like kinases, this residue is not required for autophosphorylation of the Arabidopsis RD RLK BRI1 (brassinosteroid insensitive 1). The threonine 705 of XA21 is conserved only in the JM domains of plant RLKs but not in those of fly, human, or mouse suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. These results contribute to growing knowledge regarding the mechanism by which non-RD RLKs function in plant.
21209278	A novel interaction between CCaMK and a protein containing the Scythe_N ubiquitin-like domain in Lotus japonicus.	2011	Plant Physiol	In the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is a key regulator for both rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis. Deregulation of CCaMK by either a point mutation in the autophosphorylation site or the deletion of the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain results in spontaneous nodule formation without rhizobia. However, the underlying biochemical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using the kinase domain of CCaMK as a bait in yeast two-hybrid screening, we identify a novel protein, CIP73 (for CCaMK-interacting protein of approximately 73 kD), that interacts with CCaMK. CIP73 contains a Scythe_N ubiquitin-like domain and belongs to the large ubiquitin superfamily. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis demonstrate that CIP73 could only interact with CCaMK when the calmodulin-binding domain and three EF-hand motifs are removed from the kinase domain. The amino-terminal 80 amino acid residues (80-160) of CCaMK are required for interacting with CIP73 in yeast cells. On the other hand, protein pull-down assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in Nicotiana benthamiana show that the full-length CCaMK could interact with CIP73 in vitro and in planta. Importantly, CCaMK phosphorylates the amino terminus of CIP73 in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner in vitro. CIP73 transcripts are preferentially expressed in roots, and very low expression is detected in leaves, stems, and nodules. The expression in roots is significantly decreased after inoculation of Mesorhizobium loti. RNA interference knockdown of CIP73 expression by hairy root transformation in Lotus japonicus led to decreased nodule formation, suggesting that CIP73 performed an essential role in nodulation.
10363369	The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter.	1999	Plant J	The DNA-binding proteins PF1 and GT-2 are factors that bind to different functionally defined, positively acting cis-elements in the PHYA genes of oat and rice, respectively. PF1 is an HMG-I/Y protein, with its cognate cis-element being an AT-rich sequence, designated PE1, whereas GT-2 is a transcriptional activator with twin DNA binding domains that recognize a triplet of GT-boxes in a complex motif designated GTE. To further define the DNA-binding activity of PF1 and to explore potential inter-relationships between the two factors, we have performed a series of in vitro DNA-binding experiments with both PE1 and GTE target sites. The data show that, consistent with its membership of the HMG-I/Y protein family, PF1 can bend DNA when bound to PE1. In addition, PF1 can bind promiscuously, with varying affinity, to other AT-containing motifs, including GTE. When co-incubated with GT-2, PF1 enhances the specific DNA-binding activity of GT-2 toward GTE, the first report of such activity for a plant HMG-I/Y protein. This enhancement takes place without demonstrable physical contact between the two proteins, suggesting the possibility of a novel, indirect mechanism of recruitment involving DNA target-site pre-conditioning. The evidence indicates therefore that PF1 and GT-2 do not perform functionally equivalent roles in positively regulating oat and rice PHYA gene expression. However, the data suggest the possibility that PF1 may act as an architectural factor, promiscuously recognizing a spectrum of AT-containing elements in plant promoters, with the general function of catalyzing enhanced binding of conventional cognate transcriptional regulators to these elements via DNA bending.
8672890	GT-2: in vivo transcriptional activation activity and definition of novel twin DNA binding domains with reciprocal target sequence selectivity.	1996	Plant Cell	GT-2 is a novel DNA binding protein that interacts with a triplet functionally defined, positively acting GT-box motifs (GT1-bx, GT2-bx, and GT3-bx) in the rice phytochrome A gene (PHYA) promoter. Data from a transient transfection assay used here show that recombinant GT-2 enhanced transcription from both homologous and heterologous GT-box-containing promoters, thereby indicating that this protein can function as a transcriptional activator in vivo. Previously, we have shown that GT-2 contains separate DNA binding determinants in its N- and C-terminal halves, with binding site preferences for the GT3-bx and GT2-bx promoter motifs, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that the minimal DNA binding domains reside within dual 90-amino acid polypeptide segments encompassing duplicated sequences, termed trihelix regions, in each half of the molecule, plus 15 additional immediately adjacent amino acids downstream. These minimal binding domains retained considerable target sequence selectivity for the different GT-box motifs, but this selectivity was enhanced by a separate polypeptide segment farther downstream on the C-terminal side of each trihelix region. Therefore, the data indicate that the twin DNA binding domains of GT-2 each consist of a general GT-box recognition core with intrinsic differential binding activity toward closely related target motifs and a modified sequence conferring higher resolution reciprocal selectivity between these motifs.
2255908	A trans-acting factor that binds to a GT-motif in a phytochrome gene promoter.	1990	Science	The regulatory photoreceptor, phytochrome, controls the expression of numerous genes, including its own phyA genes, which are transcriptionally repressed in response to light. Functional analysis of a rice phyA gene promoter, by means of microprojectile-mediated gene transfer, indicates that a GT motif, GCGGTAATT, closely related to elements in the promoters of a number of other light-regulated genes, is critical for expression. Partial complementary DNA clones have been obtained for a rice nuclear protein, designated GT-2, that binds in a highly sequence-specific fashion to this motif. Mutational analysis shows that the paired G's are most crucial to binding. GT-2 has domains related to certain other transcription factors. Northern blot analysis shows that GT-2 messenger RNA levels decline in white light although red and far red light pulses are ineffective.
19616606	Evolution of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes: duplications and possible losses before and after the divergence of major eukaryotic groups.	2009	Gene	Eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs, encoded by RDR genes) play critical roles in developmental regulation, maintenance of genome integrity, and defense against foreign nucleic acids. However, the phylogenetic relationship of RDRs remains unclear. From available genome sequences, we identified 161 putative RDR genes from 56 eukaryotes, ranging from protists to multicellular organisms, including plants, fungi and invertebrate animals, such as nematodes, lancelet and sea anemone. On the other hand, we did not detect RDR homologs in vertebrates and insects, even though RNA interference functions in these organisms. Our phylogenetic analysis of the RDR genes suggests that the eukaryotic ancestor might have had three copies, i.e. RDRalpha, RDRbeta and RDRgamma. These three ancient copies were also supported by the patterns of protein sequence motifs. Further duplication events after the divergence of major eukaryotic groups were supported by the phylogenetic analyses, including some that likely occurred before the separation of subgroups within each kingdom. We present a model for a possible evolutionary history of RDR genes in eukaryotes.
24241455	A 5-methyltryptophan resistant rice mutant, MTR1, selected in tissue culture.	1987	Theor Appl Genet	Cell lines resistant to tryptophan analogue 5-methyltryptophan (5MT) were selected in seed-derived calli of Oryza sativa L. var. 'Norin 8'. Plants were regenerated (R1 from one selected callus line (MTR1). In three out of the six R1 plants, 5MT resistance was inherited in the R2 and R3 generations as a dominant nuclear mutation. Segregation ratios in the progeny of heterozygous plants were 1∶1. Morphological and fertility variation seen in some of the R2 plants were not correlated with 5-methyltryptophan resistance. Resistance in the MTR1 callus was due to the accumulation of high levels of free tryptophan (87-fold) that was associated with an increase in free phenylalanine content (9-fold). The leaves of resistant plants also contained elevated levels of free tryptophan and phenylalanine.
18308333	Structural insights into rice BGlu1 beta-glucosidase oligosaccharide hydrolysis and transglycosylation.	2008	J Mol Biol	The structures of rice BGlu1 beta-glucosidase, a plant beta-glucosidase active in hydrolyzing cell wall-derived oligosaccharides, and its covalent intermediate with 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside have been solved at 2.2 A and 1.55 A resolution, respectively. The structures were similar to the known structures of other glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases, but showed several differences in the loops around the active site, which lead to an open active site with a narrow slot at the bottom, compatible with the hydrolysis of long beta-1,4-linked oligosaccharides. Though this active site structure is somewhat similar to that of the Paenibacillus polymyxa beta-glucosidase B, which hydrolyzes similar oligosaccharides, molecular docking studies indicate that the residues interacting with the substrate beyond the conserved -1 site are completely different, reflecting the independent evolution of plant and microbial GH1 exo-beta-glucanase/beta-glucosidases. The complex with the 2-fluoroglucoside included a glycerol molecule, which appears to be in a position to make a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon in a transglycosylation reaction. The coordination of the hydroxyl groups suggests that sugars are positioned as acceptors for transglycosylation by their interactions with E176, the catalytic acid/base, and Y131, which is conserved in barley BGQ60/beta-II beta-glucosidase, that has oligosaccharide hydrolysis and transglycosylation activity similar to rice BGlu1. As the rice and barley enzymes have different preferences for cellobiose and cellotriose, residues that appeared to interact with docked oligosaccharides were mutated to those of the barley enzyme to see if the relative activities of rice BGlu1 toward these substrates could be changed to those of BGQ60. Although no single residue appeared to be responsible for these differences, I179, N190 and N245 did appear to interact with the substrates.
23652799	Analysis of nucleotide diversity among alleles of the major bacterial blight resistance gene Xa27 in cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relatives.	2013	Planta	Xa27 is one of the important R-genes, effective against bacterial blight disease of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Using natural population of Oryza, we analyzed the sequence variation in the functionally important domains of Xa27 across the Oryza species. DNA sequences of Xa27 alleles from 27 rice accessions revealed higher nucleotide diversity among the reported R-genes of rice. Sequence polymorphism analysis revealed synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in addition to a number of InDels in non-coding regions of the gene. High sequence variation was observed in the promoter region including the 5'UTR with 'π' value 0.00916 and 'θ w ' = 0.01785. Comparative analysis of the identified Xa27 alleles with that of IRBB27 and IR24 indicated the operation of both positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1) and neutral selection (Ka/Ks ≈ 0). The genetic distances of alleles of the gene from Oryza nivara were nearer to IRBB27 as compared to IR24. We also found the presence of conserved and null UPT (upregulated by transcriptional activator) box in the isolated alleles. Considerable amino acid polymorphism was localized in the trans-membrane domain for which the functional significance is yet to be elucidated. However, the absence of functional UPT box in all the alleles except IRBB27 suggests the maintenance of single resistant allele throughout the natural population.
23717315	Characterization of the phosphofructokinase gene family in rice and its expression under oxygen deficiency stress.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Plants possess two types of phosphofructokinase proteins for phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK) and the pyrophosphate-(PPi) dependent pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate-phosphotransferase (PFP). During oxygen deficiency ATP levels in rice seedlings are severely reduced, and it is hypothesized that PPi is used as an alternative energy source for the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate during glycolysis. In this study, we analyzed the expression of 15 phosphofructokinase-encoding genes in roots and aerial tissues of anoxia-tolerant rice seedlings in response to anoxic stress and compared our data with transcript profiles obtained from microarray analyses. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of rice PFK proteins was determined, and the PFK and PFP isoforms were grouped in a phylogenetic tree. Two PFK and two PFP transcripts accumulated during anoxic stress, whereas mRNA levels of four PFK and three PFP genes were decreased. The total specific activity of both PFK and PFP changed only slightly during a 24-h anoxia treatment. It is assumed that expression of different isoforms and their catalytic properties differ during normoxic and anoxic conditions and contribute to balanced glycolytic activity during the low-oxygen stress. These characterizations of phosphofructokinase genes and the comparison to other plant species allowed us to suggest candidate rice genes for adaptation to anoxic stress.
19838050	Kinship in the SRP RNA family.	None	RNA Biol	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex which participates in the targeting of protein to cellular membranes. The RNA component of the SRP has been found in all domains of life, but the size of the molecule and the number of RNA secondary structure elements vary considerably between the different phylogenetic groups. We continued our efforts to identify new SRP RNAs, compare their sequences, discover new secondary structure elements, conserved motifs, and other properties. We found additional proof for the variability in the apical loop of helix 8, and we identified several bacteria which lack all of their SRP components. Based on the distribution of SRP RNA features within the taxonomy, we suggest seven alignment groups: Bacteria with a small (4.5S) SRP RNA, Bacteria with a large (6S) SRP RNA, Archaea, Fungi (Ascomycota), Metazoa group, Protozoa group, and Plants. The proposed divisions improve the prediction of more distantly related SRP RNAs and provide a more inclusive representation of the SRP RNA family. Updates of the Rfam SRP RNA sequence collection are expected to benefit from the suggested groupings.
23715469	RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 forms a ternary complex with JAZ and class-C bHLH factors and regulates jasmonate-induced gene expression and root cell elongation.	2013	Plant Cell	Plasticity of root growth in response to environmental cues and stresses is a fundamental characteristic of land plants. However, the molecular basis underlying the regulation of root growth under stressful conditions is poorly understood. Here, we report that a rice nuclear factor, RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 (RSS3), regulates root cell elongation during adaptation to salinity. Loss of function of RSS3 only moderately inhibits cell elongation under normal conditions, but it provokes spontaneous root cell swelling, accompanied by severe root growth inhibition, under saline conditions. RSS3 is preferentially expressed in the root tip and forms a ternary complex with class-C basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN proteins, the latter of which are the key regulators of jasmonate (JA) signaling. The mutated protein arising from the rss3 allele fails to interact with bHLH factors, and the expression of a significant portion of JA-responsive genes is upregulated in rss3. These results, together with the known roles of JAs in root growth regulation, suggest that RSS3 modulates the expression of JA-responsive genes and plays a crucial role in a mechanism that sustains root cell elongation at appropriate rates under stressful conditions.
9375785	Molecular cloning of three rice alpha-tubulin isotypes: differential expression in tissues and during flower development.	1997	Biochim Biophys Acta	We have isolated three rice cDNA sequences coding for divergent isotypes of alpha-tubulin. TubA1 and TubA2 are members of the plant subfamily I of alpha-tubulins whereas TubA3 belongs to subfamily II. The pattern of accumulation of TubA3 mRNA in rice flowers, roots and coleoptile segments treated with auxin differs significantly from what observed for TubA1 and TubA2 mRNAs.
19558411	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice.	2009	Plant Cell Environ	In much of the tropics and subtropics, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown under long days (LDs). Therefore, LD must play a major role in inducing flowering signal in rice. However, little is known on LD-dependent flowering signal in the species. We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering. However, its detailed photoperiodic mechanism was not yet elucidated. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56. Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions. Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD. In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased. On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged. These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated an interaction between those two proteins as well as their formation of homodimers. These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes.
20459318	Abscisic acid interacts antagonistically with salicylic acid signaling pathway in rice-Magnaporthe grisea interaction.	2010	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Plant hormones play pivotal signaling roles in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report characterization of an antagonistic interaction of abscisic acid (ABA) with salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways in the rice-Magnaporthe grisea interaction. Exogenous application of ABA drastically compromised the rice resistance to both compatible and incompatible M. grisea strains, indicating that ABA negatively regulates both basal and resistance gene-mediated blast resistance. ABA markedly suppressed the transcriptional upregulation of WRKY45 and OsNPR1, the two key components of the SA signaling pathway in rice, induced by SA or benzothiadiazole or by blast infection. Overexpression of OsNPR1 or WRKY45 largely negated the enhancement of blast susceptibility by ABA, suggesting that ABA acts upstream of WRKY45 and OsNPR1 in the rice SA pathway. ABA-responsive genes were induced during blast infection in a pattern reciprocal to those of WRKY45 and OsPR1b in the compatible rice-blast interaction but only marginally in the incompatible one. These results suggest that the balance of SA and ABA signaling is an important determinant for the outcome of the rice-M. grisea interaction. ABA was detected in hyphae and conidia of M. grisea as well as in culture media, implying that blast-fungus-derived ABA could play a role in triggering ABA signaling at host infection sites.
18980657	A putative lipase gene EXTRA GLUME1 regulates both empty-glume fate and spikelet development in rice.	2009	Plant J	Recent studies have shown that molecular control of inner floral organ identity appears to be largely conserved between monocots and dicots, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying development of the monocot outer floral organ, a unique floral structure in grasses. In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (EG1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy. In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in EG1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls. Iterative glume-like structures or new floral organ primordia were formed in the presumptive region of the carpel, resulting in an indeterminate floral meristem. EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia. We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1. As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development.
24336200	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice.	2013	Nature	Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that control plant shoot branching. SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction of DWARF 14 (D14), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling. Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation. Moreover, D53 can interact with transcriptional co-repressors known as TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS. Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14-D3 complex.
19966073	A root-expressed magnesium transporter of the MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana allows for growth in low-Mg2+ environments.	2009	Plant Cell	The MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the superfamily of CorA-MRS2-ALR-type membrane proteins. Proteins of this type are characterized by a GMN tripeptide motif (Gly-Met-Asn) at the end of the first of two C-terminal transmembrane domains and have been characterized as magnesium transporters. Using the recently established mag-fura-2 system allowing direct measurement of Mg(2+) uptake into mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that all members of the Arabidopsis family complement the corresponding yeast mrs2 mutant. Highly different patterns of tissue-specific expression were observed for the MRS2/MGT family members in planta. Six of them are expressed in root tissues, indicating a possible involvement in plant magnesium supply and distribution after uptake from the soil substrate. Homozygous T-DNA insertion knockout lines were obtained for four members of the MRS2/MGT gene family. A strong, magnesium-dependent phenotype of growth retardation was found for mrs2-7 when Mg(2+) concentrations were lowered to 50 microM in hydroponic cultures. Ectopic overexpression of MRS2-7 from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter results in complementation and increased biomass accumulation. Green fluorescent protein reporter gene fusions indicate a location of MRS2-7 in the endomembrane system. Hence, contrary to what is frequently found in analyses of plant gene families, a single gene family member knockout results in a strong, environmentally dependent phenotype.
11489171	Overexpression of DWARF4 in the brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway results in increased vegetative growth and seed yield in Arabidopsis.	2001	Plant J	Plants unable to synthesize or perceive brassinosteroids (BRs) are dwarfs. Arabidopsis dwf4 was shown to be defective in a steroid 22alpha hydroxylase (CYP90B1) step that is the putative rate-limiting step in the BR biosynthetic pathway. To better understand the role of DWF4 in BR biosynthesis, transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically overexpressing DWF4 (AOD4) were generated, using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and their phenotypes were characterized. The hypocotyl length of both light- and dark-grown AOD4 seedlings was increased dramatically as compared to wild type. At maturity, inflorescence height increased >35% in AOD4 lines and >14% in tobacco DWF4 overexpressing lines (TOD4), relative to controls. The total number of branches and siliques increased more than twofold in AOD4 plants, leading to a 59% increase in the number of seeds produced. Analysis of endogenous BR levels in dwf4, Ws-2 and AOD4 revealed that dwf4 accumulated the precursors of the 22alpha-hydroxylation steps, whereas overexpression of DWF4 resulted in increased levels of downstream compounds relative to Ws-2, indicative of facilitated metabolic flow through the step. Both the levels of DWF4 transcripts and BR phenotypic effects were progressively increased in dwf4, wild-type and AOD4 plants, respectively. This suggests that it will be possible to control plant growth by engineering DWF4 transcription in plants.
20381393	DNA methylation mediated by a microRNA pathway.	2010	Mol Cell	In plants, the known microRNAs (miRNAs) are produced as approximately 21 nucleotide (nt) duplexes from their precursors by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). They are incorporated into Argonaute 1 (AGO1) protein to regulate target gene expression primarily through mRNA cleavage. We report here the discovery of a class of miRNAs in the model monocot rice (Oryza sativa). These are 24 nt in length and require another member of the Dicer family, DCL3, for their biogenesis. The 24 nt long miRNAs (lmiRNAs) are loaded into AGO4 clade proteins according to hierarchical rules, depending on the upstream biogenesis machinery and the 5'-terminal nucleotide. We demonstrated that lmiRNAs direct DNA methylation at loci from which they are produced as well as in trans at their target genes and play roles in gene regulation. Considered together, our findings define a miRNA pathway that mediates DNA methylation.

11706167	Diversity of Arabidopsis genes encoding precursors for phytosulfokine, a peptide growth factor.	2001	Plant Physiol	Phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha), a unique plant peptide growth factor, was originally isolated from conditioned medium of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) mesophyll cell cultures. PSK-alpha has several biological activities including promoting plant cell proliferation. Four genes that encode precursors of PSK-alpha have been identified from Arabidopsis. Analysis of cDNAs for two of these, AtPSK2 and AtPSK3, shows that both of these genes consist of two exons and one intron. The predicted precursors have N-terminal signal peptides and only a single PSK-alpha sequence located close to their carboxyl termini. Both precursors contain dibasic processing sites flanking PSK, analogous to animal and yeast prohormones. Although the PSK domain including the sequence of PSK-alpha and three amino acids preceding it are perfectly conserved, the precursors bear very limited similarity among Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa), suggesting a new level of diversity among polypeptides that are processed into the same signaling molecule in plants, a scenario not found in animals and yeast. Unnatural [serine-4]PSK-beta was found to be secreted by transgenic Arabidopsis cells expressing a mutant of either AtPSK2 or AtPSK3 cDNAs, suggesting that both AtPSK2 and AtPSK3 encode PSK-alpha precursors. AtPSK2 and AtPSK3 were expressed demonstrably not only in cultured cells but also in intact plants, suggesting that PSK-alpha may be essential for plant cell proliferation in vivo as well as in vitro. Overexpression of either precursor gene allowed the transgenic calli to grow twice as large as the controls. However, the transgenic cells expressing either antisense cDNA did not dramatically decrease mitogenic activity, suggesting that these two genes may act redundantly.
10734215	Existence of a plant tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase: novel plant enzyme catalyzing tyrosine O-sulfation of preprophytosulfokine variants in vitro.	2000	FEBS Lett	An in vitro assay system to detect tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) activity of higher plant cells was established, using synthetic oligopeptides based on the deduced amino acid sequence of a phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK-alpha) precursor. TPST activity was found in microsomal membrane fractions of rice, asparagus and carrot cells and it was confirmed that acidic amino acid residues adjacent to the tyrosine residues of acceptor peptides were essential to the sulfation reaction. The asparagus TPST exhibited a broad pH optimum of 7.0-8.5, required manganese ions for maximal activity and appeared to be a membrane-bound protein localized in the Golgi apparatus. These enzymes should be defined as a new class of plant sulfotransferases that catalyze tyrosine O-sulfation of a PSK-alpha precursor and other unknown proteins.
2103449	Characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) actin gene family.	1990	Plant Mol Biol	Four rice (Oryza sativa) genomic actin genes have been characterized. The rice actin genes show a conservation of intron number and position that is characteristic of plant actins. Sequence comparisons revealed that the plant actins generally have a high degree of inter- and intraspecific sequence heterogeneity. However, one rice actin gene has a much higher degree of nucleotide sequence identity to a previously isolated actin sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana than to any other plant actin gene. This leads us to suggest that the two sequences may represent functionally homologous genes which arose from an ancient actin gene lineage that was separated by the divergence of the dicot and monocot plants. Genomic DNA blot analysis showed that the rice actin gene family contains at least eight unique members. RNA hybridization analysis revealed that individual rice actin genes can display different patterns of transcript accumulation. The observed differences in sequence and transcript accumulation patterns suggest that the individual rice actin genes may differ in their transcriptional regulation and/or cellular function.
23985993	A natural variant of NAL1, selected in high-yield rice breeding programs, pleiotropically increases photosynthesis rate.	2013	Sci Rep	Improvement of leaf photosynthesis is an important strategy for greater crop productivity. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus GPS (GREEN FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) controls photosynthesis rate by regulating carboxylation efficiency. Map-based cloning revealed that GPS is identical to NAL1 (NARROW LEAF1), a gene previously reported to control lateral leaf growth. The high-photosynthesis allele of GPS was found to be a partial loss-of-function allele of NAL1. This allele increased mesophyll cell number between vascular bundles, which led to thickened leaves, and it pleiotropically enhanced photosynthesis rate without the detrimental side effects observed in previously identified nal1 mutants, such as dwarf plant stature. Furthermore, pedigree analysis suggested that rice breeders have repeatedly selected the high-photosynthesis allele in high-yield breeding programs. The identification and utilization of NAL1 (GPS) can enhance future high-yield breeding and provides a new strategy for increasing rice productivity.
12723603	Characterization of rice functional monosaccharide transporter, OsMST5.	2003	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	cDNA of a monosaccharide transporter in rice, OsMST5 (Oryza sativa monosaccharide transporter 5) was cloned and its sugar transport activity was characterized by heterologous expression analysis. The amino acid sequence and topology were similar to the sequences and topology of other plant monosaccharide transporters. Yeast cells co-expressed with OsMST5 cDNA transported some monosaccharide substrates. The transport rate increased when ethanol as an electron donor was added, so the transporter was an energy-dependent active one. Most of the OsMST5 was expressed in panicles before pollination, indicating that it is associated with pollen development in rice.
11851910	Characterization of plant proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), and their distribution in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles.	2001	Plant J	The biochemical and cell cycle-dependent properties of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (OsPCNA) and flap endonuclease-1 (OsFEN-1) were characterized from rice (Oryza sativa). OsPCNA was physically associated with OsFEN-1 and increased the flap-endonuclease activity of OsFEN-1 by 2.5-fold. Northern and Western blotting analysis revealed that OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 were present in meristematic tissues such as cultured cells, shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem. No expression was detected in the mature leaves, although they were exposed to UV. Both of these proteins were localized in the nuclei of the interphase cells including G1, S and G2, and in the nuclear region at telophase. The distribution patterns of plant PCNA and FEN-1 in meiotic cell progression were investigated using microsporocytes of lily (Lilium longiflorum cv. Hinomoto). During the leptotene to pachytene stages, PCNA and FEN-1 were localized in the nuclear region. The florescence gradually disappeared from diplotene to metaphase I. Interestingly, signals for PCNA formed 10-20 intense spots at leptotene. The number of spots decreased to 1-5 at zygotene and finally to 1 at pachytene. The roles of OsPCNA and OsFEN-1 in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles are discussed.
18378529	Unequal genetic redundancy of rice PISTILLATA orthologs, OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, in lodicule and stamen development.	2008	Plant Cell Physiol	Two homologs of PISTILLATA have been identified in rice: OsMADS2 and OsMADS4. However, their roles in floral organ development are controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the genes show unequal redundancy of class B function. Although OsMADS2 plays an important role in lodicule development, OsMADS4 also supports the specification of lodicule identity. In contrast, the genes are roughly equally important in stamen development. Consistent with their redundant functions, both OsMADS2 and OsMADS4 interact with the unique rice AP3 ortholog SPW1.
24120393	Antioxidant capacity responsible for a hypocholesterolemia is independent of dietary cholesterol in adult rats fed rice protein.	2014	Gene	Dietary cholesterol and aging are major risk factors to accelerate oxidation process for developing hypercholesterolemia. The major aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of rice protein on cholesterol level and oxidative stress in adult rats fed with and without cholesterol. After 2 weeks of feeding, hepatic and plasma contents of cholesterol, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) were measured. In liver, total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), activities of antioxidant enzymes (total superoxide dismutase, T-SOD; catalase, CAT), glutathione metabolizing enzyme activities and gene expression levels (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, γ-GCS; glutathione reductase, GR; glutathione peroxidase, GPx) were determined. Under cholesterol-free/enriched dietary condition, T-AOC, activities of T-SOD and CAT, glutathione metabolism related enzymes' activities and mRNA levels (γ-GCS, GR and GPx) were effectively stimulated by rice proteins as compared to caseins. Compared with caseins, rice proteins significantly increased hepatic and plasma GSH contents, whereas hepatic and plasma accumulations of MDA, PCO and GSSG were significantly reduced by rice protein-feedings. As a result, the marked reductions of cholesterol in the plasma and in the liver were observed in adult rats fed rice proteins with and without cholesterol. The present study demonstrates that the hypocholesterolemic effect of rice protein is attributable to inducing antioxidative response and depressing oxidative damage in adult rats fed cholesterol-free/enriched diets. Results suggest that the antioxidant capability involved in the hypocholesterolemic action exerted by rice protein is independent of dietary cholesterol during adult period.
24145399	Rapidly evolving R genes in diverse grass species confer resistance to rice blast disease.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We show that the genomes of maize, sorghum, and brachypodium contain genes that, when transformed into rice, confer resistance to rice blast disease. The genes are resistance genes (R genes) that encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (NBS-LRR proteins). By using criteria associated with rapid molecular evolution, we identified three rapidly evolving R-gene families in these species as well as in rice, and transformed a randomly chosen subset of these genes into rice strains known to be sensitive to rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. The transformed strains were then tested for sensitivity or resistance to 12 diverse strains of M. oryzae. A total of 15 functional blast R genes were identified among 60 NBS-LRR genes cloned from maize, sorghum, and brachypodium; and 13 blast R genes were obtained from 20 NBS-LRR paralogs in rice. These results show that abundant blast R genes occur not only within species but also among species, and that the R genes in the same rapidly evolving gene family can exhibit an effector response that confers resistance to rapidly evolving fungal pathogens. Neither conventional evolutionary conservation nor conventional evolutionary convergence supplies a satisfactory explanation of our findings. We suggest a unique mechanism termed "constrained divergence," in which R genes and pathogen effectors can follow only limited evolutionary pathways to increase fitness. Our results open avenues for R-gene identification that will help to elucidate R-gene vs. effector mechanisms and may yield new sources of durable pathogen resistance.
24122830	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	Replication protein A (RPA) is a conserved heterotrimeric protein complex comprising RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3 subunits involved in multiple DNA metabolism pathways attributable to its single-stranded DNA binding property. Unlike other species possessing a single RPA2 gene, rice (Oryza sativa) possesses three RPA2 paralogs, but their functions remain unclear. In this study, we identified RPA2c, a rice gene preferentially expressed during meiosis. A T-DNA insertional mutant (rpa2c) exhibited reduced bivalent formation, leading to chromosome nondisjunction. In rpa2c, chiasma frequency is reduced by ~78% compared with the wild type and is accompanied by loss of the obligate chiasma. The residual ~22% chiasmata fit a Poisson distribution, suggesting loss of crossover control. RPA2c colocalized with the meiotic cohesion subunit REC8 and the axis-associated protein PAIR2. Localization of REC8 was necessary for loading of RPA2c to the chromosomes. In addition, RPA2c partially colocalized with MER3 during late leptotene, thus indicating that RPA2c is required for class I crossover formation at a late stage of homologous recombination. Furthermore, we identified RPA1c, an RPA1 subunit with nearly overlapping distribution to RPA2c, required for ~79% of chiasmata formation. Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice.
24065816	Variation in the interaction between alleles of HvAPETALA2 and microRNA172 determines the density of grains on the barley inflorescence.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Within the cereal grasses, variation in inflorescence architecture results in a conspicuous morphological diversity that in crop species influences the yield of cereal grains. Although significant progress has been made in identifying some of the genes underlying this variation in maize and rice, in the temperate cereals, a group that includes wheat, barley, and rye, only the dosage-dependent and highly pleiotropic Q locus in hexaploid wheat has been molecularly characterized. Here we show that the characteristic variation in the density of grains along the inflorescence, or spike, of modern cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) is largely the consequence of a perturbed interaction between microRNA172 and its corresponding binding site in the mRNA of an APELATA2 (AP2)-like transcription factor, HvAP2. We used genome-wide association and biparental mapping to identify HvAP2. By comparing inflorescence development and HvAP2 transcript abundance in an extreme dense-spike mutant and its nearly isogenic WT line, we show that HvAP2 turnover driven by microRNA 172 regulates the length of a critical developmental window that is required for elongation of the inflorescence internodes. Our data indicate that this heterochronic change, an altered timing of developmental events caused by specific temporal variation in the efficiency of HvAP2 turnover, leads to the striking differences in the size and shape of the barley spike.
24048471	Vinylogous chain branching catalysed by a dedicated polyketide synthase module.	2013	Nature	Bacteria use modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to assemble complex polyketides, many of which are leads for the development of clinical drugs, in particular anti-infectives and anti-tumoral agents. Because these multifarious compounds are notoriously difficult to synthesize, they are usually produced by microbial fermentation. During the past two decades, an impressive body of knowledge on modular PKSs has been gathered that not only provides detailed insight into the biosynthetic pathways but also allows the rational engineering of enzymatic processing lines to yield structural analogues. Notably, a hallmark of all PKS modules studied so far is the head-to-tail fusion of acyl and malonyl building blocks, which leads to linear backbones. Yet, structural diversity is limited by this uniform assembly mode. Here we demonstrate a new type of PKS module from the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica that catalyses a Michael-type acetyl addition to generate a branch in the carbon chain. In vitro reconstitution of the entire PKS module, X-ray structures of a ketosynthase-branching didomain and mutagenesis experiments revealed a crucial role of the ketosynthase domain in branching the carbon chain. We present a trapped intermediary state in which acyl carrier protein and ketosynthase are covalently linked by the branched polyketide and suggest a new mechanism for chain alkylation, which is functionally distinct from terpenoid-like β-branching. For the rice seedling blight toxin rhizoxin, one of the strongest known anti-mitotic agents, the non-canonical polyketide modification is indispensable for phytotoxic and anti-tumoral activities. We propose that the formation of related pharmacophoric groups follows the same general scheme and infer a unifying vinylogous branching reaction for PKS modules with a ketosynthase-branching-acyl-carrier-protein architecture. This study unveils the structure and function of a new PKS module that broadens the biosynthetic scope of polyketide biosynthesis and sets the stage for rationally creating structural diversity.
24104565	Reticulate evolution of the rye genome.	2013	Plant Cell	Rye (Secale cereale) is closely related to wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Due to its large genome (~8 Gb) and its regional importance, genome analysis of rye has lagged behind other cereals. Here, we established a virtual linear gene order model (genome zipper) comprising 22,426 or 72% of the detected set of 31,008 rye genes. This was achieved by high-throughput transcript mapping, chromosome survey sequencing, and integration of conserved synteny information of three sequenced model grass genomes (Brachypodium distachyon, rice [Oryza sativa], and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor]). This enabled a genome-wide high-density comparative analysis of rye/barley/model grass genome synteny. Seventeen conserved syntenic linkage blocks making up the rye and barley genomes were defined in comparison to model grass genomes. Six major translocations shaped the modern rye genome in comparison to a putative Triticeae ancestral genome. Strikingly dissimilar conserved syntenic gene content, gene sequence diversity signatures, and phylogenetic networks were found for individual rye syntenic blocks. This indicates that introgressive hybridizations (diploid or polyploidy hybrid speciation) and/or a series of whole-genome or chromosome duplications played a role in rye speciation and genome evolution.
24170127	Genome-wide binding analysis of the transcription activator ideal plant architecture1 reveals a complex network regulating rice plant architecture.	2013	Plant Cell	Ideal plant architecture1 (IPA1) is critical in regulating rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture and substantially enhances grain yield. To elucidate its molecular basis, we first confirmed IPA1 as a functional transcription activator and then identified 1067 and 2185 genes associated with IPA1 binding sites in shoot apices and young panicles, respectively, through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays. The Squamosa promoter binding protein-box direct binding core motif GTAC was highly enriched in IPA1 binding peaks; interestingly, a previously uncharacterized indirect binding motif TGGGCC/T was found to be significantly enriched through the interaction of IPA1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter binding factor1 or promoter binding factor2. Genome-wide expression profiling by RNA sequencing revealed IPA1 roles in diverse pathways. Moreover, our results demonstrated that IPA1 could directly bind to the promoter of rice teosinte branched1, a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth, to suppress rice tillering, and directly and positively regulate dense and erect panicle1, an important gene regulating panicle architecture, to influence plant height and panicle length. The elucidation of target genes of IPA1 genome-wide will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant architecture and to facilitating the breeding of elite varieties with ideal plant architecture.
24043799	ABI3 controls embryo degreening through Mendel's I locus.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Chlorophyll (chl) is essential for light capture and is the starting point that provides the energy for photosynthesis and thus plant growth. Obviously, for this reason, retention of the green chlorophyll pigment is considered a desirable crop trait. However, the presence of chlorophyll in mature seeds can be an undesirable trait that can affect seed maturation, seed oil quality, and meal quality. Occurrence of mature green seeds in oil crops such as canola and soybean due to unfavorable weather conditions during seed maturity is known to cause severe losses in revenue. One recently identified candidate that controls the chlorophyll degradation machinery is the stay-green gene, SGR1 that was mapped to Mendel's I locus responsible for cotyledon color (yellow versus green) in peas. A defect in SGR1 leads to leaf stay-green phenotypes in Arabidopsis and rice, but the role of SGR1 in seed degreening and the signaling machinery that converges on SGR1 have remained elusive. To decipher the gene regulatory network that controls degreening in Arabidopsis, we have used an embryo stay-green mutant to demonstrate that embryo degreening is achieved by the SGR family and that this whole process is regulated by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3); a B3 domain transcription factor that has a highly conserved and essential role in seed maturation, conferring desiccation tolerance. Misexpression of ABI3 was sufficient to rescue cold-induced green seed phenotype in Arabidopsis. This finding reveals a mechanistic role for ABI3 during seed degreening and thus targeting of this pathway could provide a solution to the green seed problem in various oil-seed crops.
24120898	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) and a comparative mitogenomic analysis of three predominant rice planthoppers.	2014	Gene	The white-backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), is one of the most destructive pests of rice crops in many Asian countries. Using long-PCR and shotgun library methods, we sequenced the entire mitochondrial genomes (mt-genomes) of two WBPH individuals. Total lengths of the mt-genome of the two WBPH individuals were 16,612 bp and 16,654 bp with an identical AT content of 76.19%. Among the 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), only nad5 used an atypical initiation codon GTG. Most of the tRNA genes had the typical cloverleaf secondary structure except that the dihydrouridine (DHU) arms in two trnS genes and the TΨC arm of trnG gene did not form a stable stem-loop structure. Similar to the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), and the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén), some extraordinary features were observed in the WBPH mt-genome. These include similar gene rearrangement pattern, unusually short length of the atp8 gene and variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) structure in control region. Interestingly, the same tandem repeat unit with stable secondary structure appeared in two different planthoppers, WBPH and SBPH, which belong to two different genera of the Delphacidae. This peculiar feature provides a direct evidence for the close relationship between the two planthoppers and updates our understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of mitochondrial control region. Comparison with two other predominant rice planthoppers (BPH and SBPH) revealed that different PCGs of mitochondria exhibit different evolutionary patterns.
24127586	Putative megaenzyme DWA1 plays essential roles in drought resistance by regulating stress-induced wax deposition in rice.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Drought stress is a major limiting factor for crop production. Cuticular wax plays an important role in preventing water loss from drought stress. However, the genetic control of cuticular wax deposition under drought stress conditions has not been characterized. Here, we identified a rice gene Drought-Induced Wax Accumulation 1 (DWA1) encoding a very large protein (2,391 aa in length) containing multiple enzymatic structures, including an oxidoreductase-like domain; a prokaryotic nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like module, including an AMP-binding domain; and an allene oxide synthase-like domain. This previously unreported putative megaenzyme is conserved in vascular plants. A dwa1 KO mutant was highly sensitive to drought stress relative to the WT. DWA1 was preferentially expressed in vascular tissues and epidermal layers and strongly induced by drought stress. The dwa1 mutant was impaired in cuticular wax accumulation under drought stress, which significantly altered the cuticular wax composition of the plant, resulting in increased drought sensitivity. The mutant had reduced levels of very-long-chain fatty acids, and plants overexpressing DWA1 showed elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids relative to the WT. The expression of many wax-related genes was significantly suppressed in dwa1 under drought conditions. The AMP-binding domain exhibited in vitro enzymatic activity in activating long-chain fatty acids to form acyl-CoA. Our results suggest that DWA1 controls drought resistance by regulating drought-induced cuticular wax deposition in rice. This finding may have significant implications for improving the drought resistance of crop varieties.
24096344	A rice cis-natural antisense RNA acts as a translational enhancer for its cognate mRNA and contributes to phosphate homeostasis and plant fitness.	2013	Plant Cell	cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) are widespread in plants and are often associated with downregulation of their associated sense genes. We found that a cis-NAT positively regulates the level of a protein critical for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa). PHOSPHATE1;2 (PHO1;2), a gene involved in phosphate loading into the xylem in rice, and its associated cis-NATPHO1;2 are both controlled by promoters active in the vascular cylinder of roots and leaves. While the PHO1;2 promoter is unresponsive to the plant phosphate status, the cis-NATPHO1;2 promoter is strongly upregulated under phosphate deficiency. Expression of both cis-NATPHO1;2 and the PHO1;2 protein increased in phosphate-deficient plants, while the PHO1;2 mRNA level remained stable. Downregulation of cis-NATPHO1;2 expression by RNA interference resulted in a decrease in PHO1;2 protein, impaired the transfer of phosphate from root to shoot, and decreased seed yield. Constitutive overexpression of NATPHO1;2 in trans led to a strong increase of PHO1;2, even under phosphate-sufficient conditions. Under all conditions, no changes occurred in the level of expression, sequence, or nuclear export of PHO1;2 mRNA. However, expression of cis-NATPHO1;2 was associated with a shift of both PHO1;2 and cis-NATPHO1;2 toward the polysomes. These findings reveal an unexpected role for cis-NATPHO1;2 in promoting PHO1;2 translation and affecting phosphate homeostasis and plant fitness.
24035516	Transcriptomic analysis of UV-treated rice leaves reveals UV-induced phytoalexin biosynthetic pathways and their regulatory networks in rice.	2013	Phytochemistry	Rice produces diterpenoid and flavonoid phytoalexins for defense against pathogen attack. The production of phytoalexins in rice is also induced by UV-irradiation. To understand the metabolic networks involved in UV-induced phytoalexin biosynthesis and their regulation, phytochemical and transcriptomic analyses of UV-treated rice leaves were performed. In response to UV treatment, the accumulation of flavonoids was observed in rice leaves, which may serve as antioxidants against UV-induced oxidative stress. The phytochemical analysis confirmed sakuranetin accumulation and also demonstrated the induction of phenylamide synthesis in rice leaves by UV-irradiation. Transcriptomic analysis established that aromatic amino acid biosynthetic genes were immediately up-regulated after UV treatment. The genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and flavonoid biosynthesis were also up-regulated. These findings suggest that the aromatic amino acid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways are coordinately activated for the production of flavonoids and phenolic phytoalexins such as sakuranetin and phenylamides. An in silico analysis of UV-induced O-methyltransferase and acyltransferase genes suggested that these genes may be implicated in sakuranetin and phenylamide synthesis, respectively. The transcriptomic analysis also showed up-regulation of both methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes in response to UV treatment. A functional gene network analysis of phytoalexin biosynthetic and UV-induced genes for signaling components and transcription factors using RiceNet suggested that regulatory networks comprising signal perceiving receptor kinases, G-proteins, signal transducing mitogen-activated protein kinases and calcium signaling components, and transcription factors control flavonoid and phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice leaves under UV-C stress conditions.
24045020	The ubiquitin receptor DA1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase DA2 to regulate seed and organ size in Arabidopsis.	2013	Plant Cell	Seed size in higher plants is determined by the coordinated growth of the embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissue. Several factors that act maternally to regulate seed size have been identified, such as auxin response factor2, apetala2, KLUH, and DA1, but the genetic and molecular mechanisms of these factors in seed size control are almost totally unknown. We previously demonstrated that the ubiquitin receptor DA1 acts synergistically with the E3 ubiquitin ligase enhancer1 OF DA1 (EOD1)/big brother to regulate the final size of seeds in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we describe another RING-type protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, encoded by DA2, which regulates seed size by restricting cell proliferation in the maternal integuments of developing seeds. The da2-1 mutant forms large seeds, while overexpression of DA2 decreases seed size of wild-type plants. Overexpression of rice (Oryza sativa) grain width and weight2, a homolog of DA2, restricts seed growth in Arabidopsis. Genetic analyses show that DA2 functions synergistically with DA1 to regulate seed size, but does so independently of EOD1. Further results reveal that DA2 interacts physically with DA1 in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our findings define the genetic and molecular mechanisms of three ubiquitin-related proteins DA1, DA2, and EOD1 in seed size control and indicate that they are promising targets for crop improvement.
24003150	Priming of jasmonate-mediated antiherbivore defense responses in rice by silicon.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Although the function of silicon (Si) in plant physiology has long been debated, its beneficial effects on plant resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses, including insect herbivory, have been well documented. In addition, the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in mediating antiherbivore defense responses in plants. However, potential interactions between JA and Si in response to insect attack have not been examined directly. To explore the role JA may play in Si-enhanced resistance, we silenced the expression of allene oxide synthase (OsAOS; active in JA biosynthesis) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (OsCOI1; active in JA perception) genes in transgenic rice plants via RNAi and examined resulting changes in Si accumulation and defense responses against caterpillar Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (rice leaffolder, LF) infestation. Si pretreatment increased rice resistance against LF larvae in wild-type plants but not in OsAOS and OsCOI1 RNAi lines. Upon LF attack, wild-type plants subjected to Si pretreatment exhibited enhanced defense responses relative to untreated controls, including higher levels of JA accumulation; increased levels of transcripts encoding defense marker genes; and elevated activities of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and trypsin protease inhibitor. Additionally, reduced Si deposition and Si cell expansion were observed in leaves of OsAOS and OsCOI1 RNAi plants in comparison with wild-type plants, and reduced steady-state transcript levels of the Si transporters OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi6 were observed in Si-pretreated plants after LF attack. These results suggest a strong interaction between Si and JA in defense against insect herbivores involving priming of JA-mediated defense responses by Si and the promotion of Si accumulation by JA.

24042130	A collection of glycosyltransferases from rice (Oryza sativa) exposed to atrazine.	2013	Gene	The rice (Oryza sativa) GTs belong to a super family possibly with hundreds of members. However, which GTs are involved in plant response to toxic chemicals is unknown. Here, we demonstrated 59 novel GT genes screened from our recent genome-wide sequencing datasets of rice crops exposed to atrazine (a herbicide persistent in ecosystems). Analysis of GT genes showed that most of the GTs contain functional domains typically found in proteins transferring glycosyl moieties to their target compounds. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that many GT genes from different families have diverse cis-elements necessary for response to biotic and environmental stresses. Experimental validation for the GTs was undertaken through a microarray, and 36 GT genes were significantly detected with an expression pattern similar to that from deep-sequencing datasets. Furthermore, 12 GT genes were randomly selected and confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Finally, the special activity of total GTs was determined in rice roots and shoots, with an increased activity under the atrazine exposure. This response was closely associated with atrazine absorption in the rice tissues. These results indicate that exposure to atrazine can trigger specific GT genes and enzyme activities in rice.
24035935	Cloning of TPS gene from eelgrass species Zostera marina and its functional identification by genetic transformation in rice.	2013	Gene	The full-length cDNA sequence (2613 bp) of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) gene of eelgrass Zostera marina (ZmTPS) was identified and cloned. Z. marina is a kind of seed-plant growing in sea water during its whole life history. The open reading frame (ORF) region of ZmTPS gene encodes a protein of 870 amino acid residues and a stop codon. The corresponding genomic DNA sequence is 3770 bp in length, which contains 3 exons and 2 introns. The ZmTPS gene was transformed into rice variety ZH11 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. After antibiotic screening, molecular characterization, salt-tolerance and trehalose content determinations, two transgenic lines resistant to 150 mM NaCL solutions were screened. Our study results indicated that the ZmTPS gene was integrated into the genomic DNA of the two transgenic rice lines and could be expressed well. Moreover, the detection of the transformed ZmTPS gene in the progenies of the two transgenic lines was performed from T1 to T4 generations; and results suggested that the transformed ZmTPS gene can be transmitted from parent to the progeny in transgenic rice.
24077303	Mapping quantitative trait loci by controlling polygenic background effects.	2013	Genetics	A new mixed-model method was developed for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) by incorporating multiple polygenic covariance structures. First, we used genome-wide markers to calculate six different kinship matrices. We then partitioned the total genetic variance into six variance components, one corresponding to each kinship matrix, including the additive, dominance, additive × additive, dominance × dominance, additive × dominance, and dominance × additive variances. The six different kinship matrices along with the six estimated polygenic variances were used to control the genetic background of a QTL mapping model. Simulation studies showed that incorporating epistatic polygenic covariance structure can improve QTL mapping resolution. The method was applied to yield component traits of rice. We analyzed four traits (yield, tiller number, grain number, and grain weight) using 278 immortal F2 crosses (crosses between recombinant inbred lines) and 1619 markers. We found that the relative importance of each type of genetic variance varies across different traits. The total genetic variance of yield is contributed by additive × additive (18%), dominance × dominance (14%), additive × dominance (48%), and dominance × additive (15%) variances. Tiller number is contributed by additive (17%), additive × additive (22%), and dominance × additive (43%) variances. Grain number is mainly contributed by additive (42%), additive × additive (19%), and additive × dominance (31%) variances. Grain weight is almost exclusively contributed by the additive (73%) variance plus a small contribution from the additive × additive (10%) variance. Using the estimated genetic variance components to capture the polygenic covariance structure, we detected 39 effects for yield, 39 effects for tiller number, 24 for grain number, and 15 for grain weight. The new method can be directly applied to polygenic-effect-adjusted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in human and other species.
24076974	An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	Long awns are important for seed dispersal in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), but are absent in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). The genetic mechanism involved in loss-of-awn in cultivated rice remains unknown. We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, An-1, which regulates long awn formation in O. rufipogon. An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein, which regulates cell division. The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4. Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle. Genetic variations in the An-1 locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice. Population genetic analysis of wild and cultivated rice showed a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity of the An-1 locus in rice cultivars, suggesting that the An-1 locus was a major target for artificial selection. Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice.
24099390	Application of resistance gene analog markers to analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice.	2013	Genome	Plant disease resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were designed according to the conserved sequence of known RGAs and used to map resistance genes. We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana.
24023067	Arabidopsis semidwarfs evolved from independent mutations in GA20ox1, ortholog to green revolution dwarf alleles in rice and barley.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Understanding the genetic bases of natural variation for developmental and stress-related traits is a major goal of current plant biology. Variation in plant hormone levels and signaling might underlie such phenotypic variation occurring even within the same species. Here we report the genetic and molecular basis of semidwarf individuals found in natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations. Allelism tests demonstrate that independent loss-of-function mutations at GA locus 5 (GA5), which encodes gibberellin 20-oxidase 1 (GA20ox1) involved in the last steps of gibberellin biosynthesis, are found in different populations from southern, western, and northern Europe; central Asia; and Japan. Sequencing of GA5 identified 21 different loss-of-function alleles causing semidwarfness without any obvious general tradeoff affecting plant performance traits. GA5 shows signatures of purifying selection, whereas GA5 loss-of-function alleles can also exhibit patterns of positive selection in specific populations as shown by Fay and Wu's H statistics. These results suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy might underlie the occurrence of GA5 loss-of-function mutations in nature. Furthermore, because GA5 is the ortholog of rice SD1 and barley Sdw1/Denso green revolution genes, this study illustrates the occurrence of conserved adaptive evolution between wild A.thaliana and domesticated plants.
24037269	Genomic resources for gene discovery, functional genome annotation, and evolutionary studies of maize and its close relatives.	2013	Genetics	Maize is one of the most important food crops and a key model for genetics and developmental biology. A genetically anchored and high-quality draft genome sequence of maize inbred B73 has been obtained to serve as a reference sequence. To facilitate evolutionary studies in maize and its close relatives, much like the Oryza Map Alignment Project (OMAP) (www.OMAP.org) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resource did for the rice community, we constructed BAC libraries for maize inbred lines Zheng58, Chang7-2, and Mo17 and maize wild relatives Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Tripsacum dactyloides. Furthermore, to extend functional genomic studies to maize and sorghum, we also constructed binary BAC (BIBAC) libraries for the maize inbred B73 and the sorghum landrace Nengsi-1. The BAC/BIBAC vectors facilitate transfer of large intact DNA inserts from BAC clones to the BIBAC vector and functional complementation of large DNA fragments. These seven Zea Map Alignment Project (ZMAP) BAC/BIBAC libraries have average insert sizes ranging from 92 to 148 kb, organellar DNA from 0.17 to 2.3%, empty vector rates between 0.35 and 5.56%, and genome equivalents of 4.7- to 8.4-fold. The usefulness of the Parviglumis and Tripsacum BAC libraries was demonstrated by mapping clones to the reference genome. Novel genes and alleles present in these ZMAP libraries can now be used for functional complementation studies and positional or homology-based cloning of genes for translational genomics.
24218619	Comprehensive analysis of imprinted genes in maize reveals allelic variation for imprinting and limited conservation with other species.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	In plants, a subset of genes exhibit imprinting in endosperm tissue such that expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. Imprinting may arise as a consequence of mechanisms for silencing of transposons during reproduction, and in some cases imprinted expression of particular genes may provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species. Separate mechanisms for the origin of imprinted expression patterns and maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the targets of imprinting in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes, providing a comprehensive analysis that allows evaluation of imprinting at more than 95% of endosperm-expressed genes. We find that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on a subset of these genes that had >90% expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10% of imprinted genes show evidence of allelic variation for imprinting. A comparison of imprinting in maize and rice reveals that 13% of genes with syntenic orthologs in both species exhibit conserved imprinting. Genes that exhibit conserved imprinting between maize and rice have elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios compared with other imprinted genes, suggesting a history of more rapid evolution. Together, these data suggest that imprinting only has functional relevance at a subset of loci that currently exhibit imprinting in maize.
24191062	The CentO satellite confers translational and rotational phasing on cenH3 nucleosomes in rice centromeres.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant and animal centromeres comprise megabases of highly repeated satellite sequences, yet centromere function can be specified epigenetically on single-copy DNA by the presence of nucleosomes containing a centromere-specific variant of histone H3 (cenH3). We determined the positions of cenH3 nucleosomes in rice (Oryza sativa), which has centromeres composed of both the 155-bp CentO satellite repeat and single-copy non-CentO sequences. We find that cenH3 nucleosomes protect 90-100 bp of DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion, sufficient for only a single wrap of DNA around the cenH3 nucleosome core. cenH3 nucleosomes are translationally phased with 155-bp periodicity on CentO repeats, but not on non-CentO sequences. CentO repeats have an ∼10-bp periodicity in WW dinucleotides and in micrococcal nuclease cleavage, providing evidence for rotational phasing of cenH3 nucleosomes on CentO and suggesting that satellites evolve for translational and rotational stabilization of centromeric nucleosomes.
24285788	Two Rumex species from contrasting hydrological niches regulate flooding tolerance through distinct mechanisms.	2013	Plant Cell	Global climate change has increased flooding events, which affect both natural vegetation dynamics and crop productivity. The flooded environment is lethal for most plant species because it restricts gas exchange and induces an energy and carbon crisis. Flooding survival strategies have been studied in Oryza sativa, a cultivated monocot. However, our understanding of plant adaptation to natural flood-prone environments remains scant, even though wild plants represent a valuable resource of tolerance mechanisms that could be used to generate stress-tolerant crops. Here we identify mechanisms that mediate the distinct flooding survival strategies of two related wild dicot species: Rumex palustris and Rumex acetosa. Whole transcriptome sequencing and metabolite profiling reveal flooding-induced metabolic reprogramming specific to R. acetosa. By contrast, R. palustris uses the early flooding signal ethylene to increase survival by regulating shade avoidance and photomorphogenesis genes to outgrow submergence and by priming submerged plants for future low oxygen stress. These results provide molecular resolution of flooding survival strategies of two species occupying distinct hydrological niches. Learning how these contrasting flood adaptive strategies evolved in nature will be instrumental for the development of stress-tolerant crop varieties that deliver enhanced yields in a changing climate.
24280387	Jumonji C domain protein JMJ705-mediated removal of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation is involved in defense-related gene activation in rice.	2013	Plant Cell	Histone methylation is an important epigenetic modification in chromatin function, genome activity, and gene regulation. Dimethylated or trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) marks silent or repressed genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses in plants. However, the role and the mechanism of the dynamic removal of H3K27me2/3 during gene activation remain unclear. Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) Jumonji C (jmjC) protein gene JMJ705 encodes a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses H3K27me2/3. The expression of JMJ705 is induced by stress signals and during pathogen infection. Overexpression of the gene reduces the resting level of H3K27me2/3 resulting in preferential activation of H3K27me3-marked biotic stress-responsive genes and enhances rice resistance to the bacterial blight disease pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae. Mutation of the gene reduces plant resistance to the pathogen. Further analysis revealed that JMJ705 is involved in methyl jasmonate-induced dynamic removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation. The results suggest that JMJ705 is a biotic stress-responsive H3K27me2/3 demethylase that may remove H3K27me3 from marked defense-related genes and increase their basal and induced expression during pathogen infection.
24259710	Genetic analysis of the metabolome exemplified using a rice population.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant metabolites are crucial for both plant life and human nutrition. Despite recent advance in metabolomics, the genetic control of plant metabolome remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a genetic analysis of the rice metabolome that provided over 2,800 highly resolved metabolic quantitative trait loci for 900 metabolites. Distinct and overlapping accumulation patterns of metabolites were observed and complex genetic regulation of metabolism was revealed in two different tissues. We associated 24 candidate genes to various metabolic quantitative trait loci by data mining, including ones regulating important morphological traits and biological processes. The corresponding pathways were reconstructed by updating in vivo functions of previously identified and newly assigned genes. This study demonstrated a powerful tool and provided a vast amount of high-quality data for understanding the plasticity of plant metabolome, which may help bridge the gap between the genome and phenome.
24249833	Spatio-temporal transcript profiling of rice roots and shoots in response to phosphate starvation and recovery.	2013	Plant Cell	Using rice (Oryza sativa) as a model crop species, we performed an in-depth temporal transcriptome analysis, covering the early and late stages of Pi deprivation as well as Pi recovery in roots and shoots, using next-generation sequencing. Analyses of 126 paired-end RNA sequencing libraries, spanning nine time points, provided a comprehensive overview of the dynamic responses of rice to Pi stress. Differentially expressed genes were grouped into eight sets based on their responses to Pi starvation and recovery, enabling the complex signaling pathways involved in Pi homeostasis to be untangled. A reference annotation-based transcript assembly was also generated, identifying 438 unannotated loci that were differentially expressed under Pi starvation. Several genes also showed induction of unannotated splice isoforms under Pi starvation. Among these, PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2), a key regulator of Pi homeostasis, displayed a Pi starvation-induced isoform, which was associated with increased translation activity. In addition, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles after long-term Pi starvation in roots and shoots were assessed, identifying 20 miRNA families that were not previously associated with Pi starvation, such as miR6250. In this article, we present a comprehensive spatio-temporal transcriptome analysis of plant responses to Pi stress, revealing a large number of potential key regulators of Pi homeostasis in plants.
23994683	Identification of abiotic stress miRNA transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) in rice.	2013	Gene	Plant growth and yield are affected by many abiotic stresses like salinity, drought, cold and heavy metal; these stresses trigger up and down-regulate several genes through various transcription factors (TFs). Transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs), located in the upstream region of the genes, associate with TFs to regulate the gene expression. Many factors, including the activation of miRNAs, which are encoded by genes having independent transcription units, regulate the gene expression. TFBMs in the regulatory region of miRNA sequences influence the miRNA expression, which in turn influences the expression of other genes in the cell. However, the current level of information available on TFBMs of miRNA involved in abiotic stress related defense pathway(s) is limited and in-depth studies in this direction may lead to a better understanding of their role in expression and regulation of defense responses in plants. In this study, various aspects related to genomic positions of pre-miRNA, prediction of TSS and TATA box positions and identification of known, unique motifs at regulatory regions of all the reported miRNAs of rice associated with different abiotic stresses are discussed. Sixteen motifs were identified in this study, of which nine are known cis-regulatory elements associated with various stresses, two strong motifs, (CGCCGCCG, CGGCGGCG) and five unique motifs which might play a vital role in the regulation of abiotic stresses related miRNA genes. Common motifs shared by miRNAs that are involved in more than one abiotic stresses were also identified. The motifs identified in this study will be a resource for further functional validation.
23994682	Transcriptome profile reveals heat response mechanism at molecular and metabolic levels in rice flag leaf.	2013	Gene	Flag leaf is one of the key photosynthesis organs during rice reproductive stage. A time course microarray analysis of rice flag leaf was done after 40°C treatment for 0 min, 20 min, 60 min, 2h, 4h, and 8h. The identified significant heat responsive genes were mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, protein binding, antioxidant, and stress response. KMC analysis discovered the time-dependent gene expression pattern under heat. MapMan analysis demonstrated that, under heat treatment, Hsp genes and genes involved in glycolysis and ubiquitin-proteasome were enhanced, and genes involved in TCA, carotenoid, dihydroflavonol and anthocyanin metabolisms and light-reaction in the photosynthesis were widely repressed. Meanwhile, some rate-limiting enzyme genes in shikimate, lignin, and mevalonic acid metabolisms were up-regulated, revealing the importance of maintaining specific secondary metabolites under heat stress. The present study increased our understanding of heat response in rice flag leaf and provided good candidate genes for crop improvement.
24033867	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination.	2013	Plant J	Seed germination and innate immunity both have significant effects on plant life spans because they control the plant's entry into the ecosystem and provide defenses against various external stresses, respectively. Much ecological evidence has shown that seeds with high vigor are generally more tolerant of various environmental stimuli in the field than those with low vigor. However, there is little genetic evidence linking germination and immunity in plants. Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity. We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α-amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination. Moreover, it also inhibits the expression of defense genes, and so reduces the resistance of rice plants to fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as herbivorous insects. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OslecRK interacts with an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) in vivo via its kinase domain. Moreover, the rice adf mutant exhibited a reduced seed germination rate due to the suppression of α-amylase gene expression. This mutant also exhibited depressed immune responses and reduced resistance to biotic stresses. Our results thus provide direct genetic evidence for a common physiological pathway connecting germination and immunity in plants. They also partially explain the common observation that high-vigor seeds often perform well in the field. The dual effects of OslecRK may be indicative of progressive adaptive evolution in rice.
24153418	Analysis of rice ER-resident J-proteins reveals diversity and functional differentiation of the ER-resident Hsp70 system in plants.	2013	J Exp Bot	The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone system participates in protein folding and quality control of unfolded proteins. To examine the roles of co-chaperones in the rice Hsp70 chaperone system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the functions of six ER-resident J-proteins (OsP58A, OsP58B, OsERdj2, OsERdj3A, OsERdj3B, and OsERdj7) in rice were investigated. The expression of OsP58B, OsERdj3A, and OsERdj3B was predominantly up-regulated in roots subjected to ER stress. This response was mediated by signalling through ATF6 orthologues such as OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60, but not through the IRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway. A co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj3B preferentially interact with the major OsBiP, OsBiP1, while OsERdj3A interacts preferentially with OsBiP5, suggesting that there are different affinities between OsBiPs and J-proteins. In the endosperm tissue, OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj2 were mainly localized in the ER, whereas OsERdj2 was localized around the outer surfaces of ER-derived protein bodies (PB-Is). Furthermore, OsERdj3A was not expressed in wild-type seeds but was up-regulated in transgenic seeds accumulating human interleukin-7 (hIL-7). Since ERdj3A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was also detected in vacuoles of callus cells under ER stress conditions, OsERdj3A is a bona fide vacuole-localized protein. OsP58A, OsP58B and OsERdj3A were differentially accumulated in transgenic plants expressing various recombinant proteins. These results reveal the functional diversity of the rice ER-resident Hsp70 system.
24205207	Relationship between disease resistance and rice oxalate oxidases in transgenic rice.	2013	PLoS One	Differential expression of rice oxalate oxidase genes (OsOxO1-4) in rice leaves (Oryza sativa L.) in response to biotic stress was assayed using RT-PCR. OsOxO4 was induced transiently at 12 h in plants inoculated with the pathogens of bacterial blight and that of the wounding control. Inoculation with the rice blast pathogen induced OsOxO2 expression compared to the mock spray control. Overexpressing OsOxO1 or OsOxO4 in rice resulted in elevated transcript levels of the respective transgene as well as OsOxO3 in leaves compared to that in untransformed wild type (WT). In a line of RNA-i transgenic rice plants (i-12), expression of all four OsOxO genes except that of OsOxO2 was severely inhibited. Oxalate oxidase (OxO, EC 1.2.3.4) activity in plants overexpressing OsOxO1 or OsOxO4 was substantially higher than that in WT and the RNA-i lines. It was found that transgenic rice plants with substantially higher OxO activity were not more resistant to rice blast and bacterial blight than WT. In contrast, some RNA-i lines with less OxO activity seemed to be more resistant to rice blast while some overexpressing lines were more susceptible to rice blast than WT. Therefore, OxO might not be a disease resistance factor in rice.
24215658	The rice RING E3 ligase, OsCTR1, inhibits trafficking to the chloroplasts of OsCP12 and OsRP1, and its overexpression confers drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Plant growth under low water availability adversely affects many key processes with morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular consequences. Here, we found that a rice gene, OsCTR1, encoding the RING Ub E3 ligase plays an important role in drought tolerance. OsCTR1 was highly expressed in response to dehydration treatment and defense-related phytohormones, and its encoded protein was localized in both the chloroplasts and the cytosol. Intriguingly, the OsCTR1 protein was found predominantly targeted to the cytosol when rice protoplasts transfected with OsCTR1 were treated with abscisic acid (ABA). Several interacting partners were identified, which were mainly targeted to the chloroplasts, and interactions with OsCTR1 were confirmed by using biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Interestingly, two chloroplast-localized proteins (OsCP12 and OsRP1) interacted with OsCTR1 in the cytosol, and ubiquitination by OsCTR1 led to protein degradation via the Ub 26S proteasome. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsCTR1 in Arabidopsis exhibited hypersensitive phenotypes with respect to ABA-responsive seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal closure. The ABA-sensitive transgenic plants also showed improvement in their tolerance against severe water deficits. Taken together, our findings lend support to the hypothesis that the molecular functions of OsCTR1 are related to tolerance to water-deficit stress via ABA-dependent regulation and related systems.
24124527	Overexpression of OsEXPA8, a root-specific gene, improves rice growth and root system architecture by facilitating cell extension.	2013	PLoS One	Expansins are unique plant cell wall proteins that are involved in cell wall modifications underlying many plant developmental processes. In this work, we investigated the possible biological role of the root-specific α-expansin gene OsEXPA8 in rice growth and development by generating transgenic plants. Overexpression of OsEXPA8 in rice plants yielded pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture (longer primary roots, more lateral roots and root hairs), increased plant height, enhanced leaf number and enlarged leaf size. Further study indicated that the average cell length in both leaf and root vascular bundles was enhanced, and the cell growth in suspension cultures was increased, which revealed the cellular basis for OsEXPA8-mediated rice plant growth acceleration. Expansins are thought to be a key factor required for cell enlargement and wall loosening. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology revealed that average wall stiffness values for 35S::OsEXPA8 transgenic suspension-cultured cells decreased over six-fold compared to wild-type counterparts during different growth phases. Moreover, a prominent change in the wall polymer composition of suspension cells was observed, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed a relative increase in the ratios of the polysaccharide/lignin content in cell wall compositions of OsEXPA8 overexpressors. These results support a role for expansins in cell expansion and plant growth.
24103920	OsKAT2 is the prevailing functional inward rectifier potassium channels in rice guard cell.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	AtKAT1 plays roles as a major channel to uptake K(+) in guard cell when stomata open in dicot model plant Arabidopsis. In a recent publication, we isolated 3 KAT-like potassium channels in rice. We expressed them in CHO cell to identify electrophysiological characteristics of the channels. OsKAT2 showed much bigger inwardly rectifying potassium channel activities among them. The histochemical X-glu staining of transgenic rice leaf blades expressing β-glucuronidase fused with OsKAT2 promoter showed that the OsKAT2 is dominantly expressed in rice guard cell. These findings indicate that OsKAT2 may be a functional ortholog of AtKAT1 in rice. Thus this gene will be the prime target for engineering the guard cell movement to improve drought tolerance in monocot plants, including most major crops.
24128296	OsACA6, a P-type IIB Ca²⁺ ATPase promotes salinity and drought stress tolerance in tobacco by ROS scavenging and enhancing the expression of stress-responsive genes.	2013	Plant J	Calcium (Ca²⁺) regulates several signalling pathways involved in growth, development and stress tolerance. Cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis is achieved by the combined action of channels, pumps and antiporters, but direct evidence for a role of Ca²⁺ATPase pumps in stress tolerance is lacking. Here we report the characterization of a Ca²⁺ ATPase gene (OsACA6) from Oryza sativa, and elucidate its functions in stress tolerance. OsACA6 transcript levels are enhanced in response to salt, drought, abscisic acid and heat. In vivo localization identified plasma membranes as an integration site for the OsACA6-GFP fusion protein. Using transgenic tobacco lines, we demonstrate that over-expression of OsACA6 is triggered during salinity and drought stresses. The enhanced tolerance to these stresses was confirmed by changes in several physiological indices, including water loss rate, photosynthetic efficiency, cell membrane stability, germination, survival rate, malondialdehyde content, electrolyte leakage and increased proline accumulation. Furthermore, over-expressing lines also showed higher leaf chlorophyll and reduced accumulation of H₂O₂ and Na⁺ ions compared to the wild-type. Reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in transgenic lines. The increased proline accumulation and ROS scavenging enzyme activities in transgenic plants over-expressing OsACA6 efficiently modulate the ROS machinery and proline biosynthesis through an integrative mechanism. Transcriptional profiling of these plants revealed altered expression of genes encoding many transcription factors, stress- and disease-related proteins, as well as signalling components. These results suggest that Ca²⁺ ATPases have diverse roles as regulators of many stress signalling pathways, leading to plant growth, development and stress tolerance.
24034348	The tRNA 3'-end processing enzyme tRNase Z2 contributes to chloroplast biogenesis in rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	tRNase Z (TRZ) is a ubiquitous endonuclease that removes the 3'-trailer from precursor tRNAs during maturation. In yeast and animals, TRZ regulates the cell cycle via its (t)RNA processing activity; however, its physiological function in higher plants has not been well characterized. This study describes the identification of a rice (Oryza sativa) TRZ2 mutant; plants homozygous for the osatrz2 mutation were albinos with deficient chlorophyll content. A microscopic analysis of the mutant plants revealed that the transition of proplastids to chloroplasts was arrested at an early stage, and the number and size of the plastids in callus cells was substantially decreased. A genetic complementation test and an RNA interference analysis confirmed that disruption of OsaTRZ2 was responsible for the mutant phenotype. OsaTRZ2 is expressed in all rice tissues, but is preferentially expressed in leaves, sheathes, and calli. OsaTRZ2 was subcellularly localized in chloroplasts, and displayed tRNA 3'-end processing activity in both in vitro and in vivo assays. In the osatrz2 mutants, transcription of plastid-encoded and nucleus-encoded RNA polymerases was severely reduced and moderately increased, respectively. These results suggest that the tRNA 3' processing activity of OsaTRZ2 contributes to chloroplast biogenesis.
24237159	Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the β subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Polygalacturonase (PG), one of the hydrolases responsible for cell wall pectin degradation, is involved in organ consenescence and biotic stress in plants. PG1 is composed of a catalytic subunit, PG2, and a non-catalytic PG1β subunit. OsBURP16 belongs to the PG1β-like subfamily of BURP-family genes and encodes one putative PG1β subunit precursor in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Transcription of OsBURP16 is induced by cold, salinity and drought stresses, as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Analysis of plant survival rates, relative ion leakage rates, accumulation levels of H2 O2 and water loss rates of leaves showed that overexpression of OsBURP16 enhanced sensitivity to cold, salinity and drought stresses compared with controls. Young leaves of Ubi::OsBURP16 transgenic plants showed reduced cell adhesion and increased cuticular transpiration rate. Mechanical strength measurement of Ubi::OsBURP16 plants showed that reduced force was required to break leaves as compared with wild type. Transgenic rice showed enhanced PG activity and reduced pectin content. All these results suggested that overexpression of OsBURP16 caused pectin degradation and affected cell wall integrity as well as transpiration rate, which decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses.
24096889	Identification of a drought-induced rice gene, OsSAP, that suppresses Bax-induced cell death in yeast.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	We identified rice genes that might be involved in drought stress tolerance by virtue of their anti-apoptotic activity. Potential anti-apoptosis related genes were identified by screening an Oryza sativa cDNA library derived from drought stressed tissues in a yeast functional assay. About 28 O. sativa cDNAs promoted yeast survival following engagement of Bax-induced apoptosis. An O. sativa cDNA encoding R12H780 was a highly conserved putative senescence-associated-protein (OsSAP). OsSAP was both highly and rapidly expressed in response to drought stress. Additionally, OsSAP was found to be localized to the mitochondria. Overall, OsSAP represents a new type of Bax suppressor related gene and endows multiple stress tolerance in yeast.
24143807	An S-domain receptor-like kinase, OsSIK2, confers abiotic stress tolerance and delays dark-induced leaf senescence in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Receptor-like kinases play important roles in plant development and defense responses; however, their functions in other processes remain unclear. Here, we report that OsSIK2, an S-domain receptor-like kinase from rice (Oryza sativa), is involved in abiotic stress and the senescence process. OsSIK2 is a plasma membrane-localized protein with kinase activity in the presence of Mn(2+). OsSIK2 is expressed mainly in rice leaf and sheath and can be induced by NaCl, drought, cold, dark, and abscisic acid treatment. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSIK2 and mutant sik2 exhibit enhanced and reduced tolerance to salt and drought stress, respectively, compared with the controls. Interestingly, a truncated version of OsSIK2 without most of the extracellular region confers higher salt tolerance than the full-length OsSIK2, likely through the activation of different sets of downstream genes. Moreover, seedlings of OsSIK2-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit early leaf development and a delayed dark-induced senescence phenotype, while mutant sik2 shows the opposite phenotype. The downstream PR-related genes specifically up-regulated by full-length OsSIK2 or the DREB-like genes solely enhanced by truncated OsSIK2 are all induced by salt, drought, and dark treatments. These results indicate that OsSIK2 may integrate stress signals into a developmental program for better adaptive growth under unfavorable conditions. Manipulation of OsSIK2 should facilitate the improvement of production in rice and other crops.
24098302	Engineering the Oryza sativa cell wall with rice NAC transcription factors regulating secondary wall formation.	2013	Front Plant Sci	Plant tissues that require structural rigidity synthesize a thick, strong secondary cell wall of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses in a complicated bridged structure. Master regulators of secondary wall synthesis were identified in dicots, and orthologs of these regulators have been identified in monocots, but regulation of secondary cell wall formation in monocots has not been extensively studied. Here we demonstrate that the rice transcription factors SECONDARY WALL NAC DOMAIN PROTEINs (SWNs) can regulate secondary wall formation in rice (Oryza sativa) and are potentially useful for engineering the monocot cell wall. The OsSWN1 promoter is highly active in sclerenchymatous cells of the leaf blade and less active in xylem cells. By contrast, the OsSWN2 promoter is highly active in xylem cells and less active in sclerenchymatous cells. OsSWN2 splicing variants encode two proteins; the shorter protein (OsSWN2S) has very low transcriptional activation ability, but the longer protein (OsSWN2L) and OsSWN1 have strong transcriptional activation ability. In rice, expression of an OsSWN2S chimeric repressor, driven by the OsSWN2 promoter, resulted in stunted growth and para-wilting (leaf rolling and browning under normal water conditions) due to impaired vascular vessels. The same OsSWN2S chimeric repressor, driven by the OsSWN1 promoter, caused a reduction of cell wall thickening in sclerenchymatous cells, a drooping leaf phenotype, reduced lignin and xylose contents and increased digestibility as forage. These data suggest that OsSWNs regulate secondary wall formation in rice and manipulation of OsSWNs may enable improvements in monocotyledonous crops for forage or biofuel applications.
24068795	Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Arabidopsis thaliana BOR1 was the first boron (B) transporter identified in living systems. There are four AtBOR1-like genes, OsBOR1, 2, 3 and 4, present in the rice genome. We characterized the activity, expression and physiological function of OsBOR4. OsBOR4 is an active efflux transporter of B. Quantitative PCR analysis and OsBOR4 promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion revealed that OsBOR4 was both highly and specifically expressed in pollen. We obtained five Tos17 insertion mutants of osbor4. The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants. We observed that in all Tos17 insertion lines tested, the frequency of osbor4 homozygous plants was lower than expected in the progeny of self-fertilized heterozygous plants. These results establish that OsBOR4 is essential for normal reproductive processes. Pollen from osbor4 homozygous plants elongated fewer tubes on wild-type stigmas, and tube elongation of mutant pollen was less efficient compared with the wild-type pollen, suggesting reduced competence of osbor4 mutant pollen. The reduced competence of mutant pollen was further supported by the crosses of independent Tos17-inserted alleles of OsBOR4. Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation.
24085307	Organ- and stress-specific expression of the ASR genes in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Rice ASR genes respond distinctly to abscisic acid, dehydration and cold stress. Their tissue-specific expression provides new hints about their possible roles in plant responses to stress. Plant ASR proteins have emerged as an interesting distinct group of proteins with apparent roles in protecting cellular structures as well as putative regulators of gene expression, both important responses of plants to environmental stresses. Regardless of the possible functions proposed by different studies, little is known about their role in cereals. To further understand the function of these proteins in the Gramineae, we investigated the expression pattern of the six ASR genes present in the rice genome in response to ABA, stress conditions and in different organs. Although transcription of most OsASRs is transiently enhanced by ABA treatment, the genes present a differential response under cold and drought stress as well as specific expression in certain tissues and organs. Analysis of their promoters reveals regulatory cis-elements associated to hormonal, sugar and stress responses. The promoters of two genes, OsASR1 and OsASR5, direct the expression of the GUS reporter gene especially to leaf vascular tissue in response to dehydration and low temperature. In control conditions, a GUS reporter assay also indicates specific expression of these two genes in roots, anthers and seed scutellar tissues. These results provide new clues about the possible role of ASRs in plant stress responses and development.
24268167	Overexpression of an S-like ribonuclease gene, OsRNS4, confers enhanced tolerance to high salinity and hyposensitivity to phytochrome-mediated light signals in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	S-like ribonucleases (S-like RNases) are homologous to S-ribonucleases (S-RNases), but are not involved in self-incompatibility. In dicotyledonous plants, S-like RNases play an important role in phosphate recycling during senescence and are induced by inorganic phosphate-starvation and in response to defense and mechanical wounding. However, little information about the functions of the S-like RNase in monocots has been reported. Here, we investigated the expression patterns and roles of an S-like RNase gene, OsRNS4, in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated responses and phytochrome-mediated light responses as well as salinity tolerance in rice. The OsRNS4 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves although its transcripts were detected in various organs. OsRNS4 expression was regulated by salt, PEG and ABA. The seedlings overexpressing OsRNS4 had longer coleoptiles and first leaves than wild-type seedlings under red light (R) and far-red light (FR), suggesting negative regulation of OsRNS4 in photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings. Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was significantly increased in the OsRNS4-overexpression (OsRNS4-OX) lines compared with that in WT, suggesting that OsRNS4 probably acts as a positive regulator in ABA responses in rice seedlings. In addition, our results demonstrate that OsRNS4-OX lines have enhanced tolerance to high salinity compared to WT. Our findings supply new evidence on the functions of monocot S-like RNase in regulating photosensitivity and abiotic stress responses.
24144792	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Leaf senescence is related to the grain-filling rate and grain weight in cereals. Many components involved in senescence regulation at either the genetic or physiological level are known. However, less is known about molecular regulation mechanisms. Here, we report that OsFBK12 (an F-box protein containing a Kelch repeat motif) interacts with S-ADENOSYL-l-METHIONINE SYNTHETASE1 (SAMS1) to regulate leaf senescence and seed size as well as grain number in rice (Oryza sativa). Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicate that OsFBK12 interacts with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and with OsSAMS1. Biochemical and physiological data showed that OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation. OsFBK12-RNA interference lines and OsSAMS1 overexpression lines showed increased ethylene levels, while OsFBK12-OX lines and OsSAMS1-RNA interference plants exhibited decreased ethylene. Phenotypically, overexpression of OsFBK12 led to a delay in leaf senescence and germination and increased seed size, whereas knockdown lines of either OsFBK12 or OsSAMS1 promoted the senescence program. Our results suggest that OsFBK12 is involved in the 26S proteasome pathway by interacting with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and that it targets the substrate OsSAMS1 for degradation, triggering changes in ethylene levels for the regulation of leaf senescence and grain size. These data have potential applications in the molecular breeding of rice.
24089432	Identification of transcription factors involved in rice secondary cell wall formation.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Using co-expression network analysis, we identified 123 transcription factors (TFs) as candidate secondary cell wall regulators in rice. To validate whether these TFs are associated with secondary cell wall formation, six TF genes belonging to the MYB, NAC or homeodomain-containing TF families were overexpressed or downregulated in rice. With the exception of OsMYB58/63-RNAi plants, all transgenic plants showed phenotypes possibly related to secondary cell wall alteration, such as dwarfism, narrow and dark green leaves, and also altered rice cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (OsCAD2) gene expression and lignin content. These results suggest that many of the 123 candidate secondary cell wall-regulating TFs are likely to function in secondary cell wall formation in rice. Further analyses were performed for the OsMYB55/61 and OsBLH6 TFs, the former being a TF in which the Arabidopsis ortholog is known to participate in lignin biosynthesis (AtMYB61) and the latter being one for which no previous involvement in cell wall formation has been reported even in Arabidopsis (BLH6). OsMYB55/61 and OsBLH6-GFP fusion proteins localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. Moreover, expression of a reporter gene driven by the OsCAD2 promoter was enhanced in rice calli when OsMYB55/61 or OsBLH6 was transiently expressed, demonstrating that they function in secondary cell wall formation. These results show the validity of identifying potential secondary cell wall TFs in rice by the use of rice co-expression network analysis.
24152437	OsPOP5, a prolyl oligopeptidase family gene from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in Escherichia coli.	2013	Int J Mol Sci	The prolyl oligopeptidase family, which is a group of serine peptidases, can hydrolyze peptides smaller than 30 residues. The prolyl oligopeptidase family in plants includes four members, which are prolyl oligopeptidase (POP, EC3.4.21.26), dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC3.4.14.5), oligopeptidase B (OPB, EC3.4.21.83), and acylaminoacyl peptidase (ACPH, EC3.4.19.1). POP is found in human and rat, and plays important roles in multiple biological processes, such as protein secretion, maturation and degradation of peptide hormones, and neuropathies, signal transduction and memory and learning. However, the function of POP is unclear in plants. In order to study POP function in plants, we cloned the cDNA of the OsPOP5 gene from rice by nested-PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA encodes a protein of 596 amino acid residues with Mw ≈ 67.29 kD. In order to analyze the protein function under different abiotic stresses, OsPOP5 was expressed in Escherichia coli. OsPOP5 protein enhanced the tolerance of E. coli to high salinity, high temperature and simulated drought. The results indicate that OsPOP5 is a stress-related gene in rice and it may play an important role in plant tolerance to abiotic stress.
24034337	Characterization of a purine permease family gene OsPUP7 involved in growth and development control in rice.	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	In this study, PUP-type cytokinin transporter genes were identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The Oryza sativa purine permease (OsPUP) family has 12 members that show similar predicted protein sequences with AtPUPs. To reveal the functions of OsPUP genes, we searched the T-DNA mutant library of rice and found one mutant for the member OsPUP7. The T-DNA insertion caused a new transcript that encodes a protein with 26 amino acids different from the native OsPUP7 at the C-terminus. The mutant showed multiple phenotypic changes including increased plant height, big seeds, and delayed flowering. The mutant also showed increased sensitivity to drought and salt stresses and treatments with kinetin and abscisic acid. OsPUP7 is expressed mainly in the vascular bundle, pistil, and stamens. The measurement of cytokinins (CKs) showed that CK content in the mutant spikelets accumulated higher than that in the wild type. Moreover, uptake experiment in the yeast fcy2 mutant suggested that OsPUP7 has the ability to transport caffeine, a CK derivative. Our results indicate that the PUP transport system also exists in rice, and OsPUP7 has an important role in the transport of CK, thus affecting developmental process and stress responses.
24157209	Overexpression of a partial fragment of the salt-responsive gene OsNUC1 enhances salt adaptation in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L.) during salt stress.	2013	Plant Sci	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) nucleolin gene, OsNUC1, transcripts were expressed in rice leaves, flowers, seeds and roots but differentially expressed within and between two pairs of salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rice lines when subjected to salt stress. Salt-resistant lines exhibited higher OsNUC1 transcript expression levels than salt-sensitive lines during 0.5% (w/v) NaCl salt stress for 6d. Two sizes of OsNUC1 full-length cDNA were found in the rice genome database and northern blot analysis confirmed their existence in rice tissues. The longer transcript (OsNUC1-L) putatively encodes for a protein with a serine rich N-terminal, RNA recognition motifs in the central domain and a glycine- and arginine-rich repeat in the C-terminal domain, while the shorter one (OsNUC1-S) putatively encodes for the similar protein without the N-terminus. Without salt stress, OsNUC1-L expressing Arabidopsis thaliana Atnuc1-L1 plants displayed a substantial but incomplete revertant phenotype, whereas OsNUC1-S expression only induced a weak effect. However, under 0.5% (w/v) NaCl salt stress they displayed a higher relative growth rate, longer root length and a lower H2O2 level than the wild type plants, suggesting a higher salt resistance. Moreover, they displayed elevated AtSOS1 and AtP5CS1 transcript levels. We propose that OsNUC1-S plays an important role in salt resistance during salt stress, a new role for nucleolin in plants.
24042572	Characterization of OsMIK in a rice mutant with reduced phytate content reveals an insertion of a rearranged retrotransposon.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	The rice low phytic acid (lpa) mutant Os-lpa-XS110-1(XS-lpa) has ~45 % reduction in seed phytic acid (PA) compared with the wild-type cultivar Xiushui 110. Previously, a single recessive gene mutation was shown to be responsible for the lpa phenotype and was mapped to a region of chromosome 3 near OsMIK (LOC_Os03g52760) and OsIPK1 (LOC_Os03g51610), two genes involved in PA biosynthesis. Here, we report the identification of a large insert in the intron of OsMIK in the XS-lpa mutant. Sequencing of fragments amplified through TAIL-PCRs revealed that the insert was a derivative of the LINE retrotransposon gene LOC_Os03g56910. Further analyses revealed the following characteristics of the insert and its impacts: (1) the inserted sequence of LOC_Os03g56910 was split at its third exon and rejoined inversely, with its 5' and 3' flanking sequences inward and the split third exon segments outward; (2) the LOC_Os03g56910 remained in its original locus in XS-lpa, and the insertion probably resulted from homologous recombination repair of a DNA double strand break; (3) while the OsMIK transcripts of XS-lpa and Xiushui 110 were identical, substantial reductions of the transcript abundance (~87 %) and the protein level (~60 %) were observed in XS-lpa, probably due to increased methylation in its promoter region. The above findings are discussed in the context of plant mutagenesis, epigenetics and lpa breeding.
24028154	Identification and functional characterization of a rice NAC gene involved in the regulation of leaf senescence.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: As the final stage of leaf development, leaf senescence may cause the decline of photosynthesis and gradual reduction of carbon assimilation, which makes it a possible limiting factor for crop yield. NACs are plant-specific transcription factors and some NACs have been confirmed to play important roles in regulating leaf senescence.

RESULTS: In this study, we reported a member of the NAC transcription factor family named OsNAP whose expression is associated with leaf senescence, and investigated its preliminary function during the process of leaf senescence. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the OsNAP transcripts were accumulated gradually in response to leaf senescence and treatment with methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA). A subcellular localization assay indicated that OsNAP is a nuclear-localized protein. Yeast one-hybrid experiments indicated that OsNAP can bind the NAC recognition site (NACRS)-like sequence. OsNAP-overexpressing transgenic plants displayed an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype at the grain-filling stage, which might be caused by the elevated JA levels and the increased expression of the JA biosynthesis-related genes LOX2 and AOC1, and showed enhanced tolerance ability to MeJA treatment at the seedling stage. Nevertheless, the leaf senescence process was delayed in OsNAP RNAi transgenic plants with a dramatic drop in JA levels and with decreased expression levels of the JA biosynthesis-related genes AOS2, AOC1 and OPR7.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that OsNAP acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence and this regulation may occur via the JA pathway.
24111723	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	New Phytol	Phosphorus (P) is crucial nutrient element for crop growth and development. However, the network pathway regulating homeostasis of phosphate (Pi) in crops has many molecular breeding unknowns. Here, we report that an auxin response factor, OsARF12, functions in Pi homeostasis. Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.32/0 mM NaH2 PO4) conditions. Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions. Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2. Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by OsARF12. These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of OsARF12, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
24078098	Molecular characterization of two small heat shock protein genes in rice: their expression patterns, localizations, networks, and heterogeneous overexpressions.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Heat stress is an example of a severe abiotic stress that plants can suffer in the field, causing a significant detrimental effect on their growth and productivity. Understanding the mechanism of plant response to heat stress is important for improving the productivity of crop plants under global warming. We used a microarray dataset that is deposited in the public database to evaluate plant responses to heat stress, and we selected the top 10 genes that are highly expressed under heat stress in rice. Two genes, OsSHSP1 (Os03g16030) and OsSHSP2 (Os01g04380), were selected for further study. These genes were highly induced in response to salt and drought but not in response to cold. In addition, OsSHSP1 and OsSHSP2 gene transcripts were induced under abscisic acid and salicylic acid but not under jasmonic acid and ethylene. Subcellular localization of proteins of 35S::OsSHSP1 were associated with the cytosol, whereas those of and 35S::OsSHSP2 were associated with the cytosol and nucleus. Heterogeneous overexpression of both genes exhibited higher germination rates than those of wild-type plants under the salt treatment, but not under heat or drought stress, supporting a hypothesis regarding functional specialization of members of small heat-shock protein family over evolutionary time. The network of both genes harboring nine sHSPs as well as at least 13 other chaperone genes might support the idea of a role for sHSPs in the chaperone network. Our findings might provide clues to shed light on the molecular functions of OsSHSP1 and OsSHSP2 in response to abiotic stresses, especially heat stress.
24062085	Comparative functional analysis of six drought-responsive promoters in transgenic rice.	2014	Planta	Rice production is greatly affected by environmental stresses such as drought and high salinity. Transgenic rice plants tolerant to such stresses are expected to be produced. Stress-responsive promoters with low expression under normal growth conditions are needed to minimize the adverse effects of stress-tolerance genes on rice growth. We performed expression analyses of drought-responsive genes in rice plants using a microarray, and selected LIP9, OsNAC6, OsLEA14a, OsRAB16D, OsLEA3-1, and Oshox24 for promoter analysis. Transient assays using the promoters indicated that AREB/ABF (abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding protein/ABA-binding factor) transcription factors enhanced expressions of these genes. We generated transgenic rice plants containing each promoter and the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. GUS assays revealed that the LIP9 and OsNAC6 promoters were induced by drought, high salinity, and ABA treatment, and both promoters showed strong activity under normal growth conditions in the root. The other promoters were strongly induced by stresses and ABA, but showed low activity under normal growth conditions. In seeds, GUS staining showed that Oshox24 expression was low and expressions of the other genes were high. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC6 under the control of the Oshox24 promoter showed increased tolerance to drought and high salinity, and no growth defects. These data suggest that the Oshox24 promoter is useful to overexpress stress-tolerance genes without adversely affecting growth.
24064929	A member of the heavy metal P-type ATPase OsHMA5 is involved in xylem loading of copper in rice.	2013	Plant Physiol	Heavy metal-transporting P-type ATPase (HMA) has been implicated in the transport of heavy metals in plants. Here, we report the function and role of an uncharacterized member of HMA, OsHMA5 in rice (Oryza sativa). Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper (Cu) concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, the concentration of Cu in the brown rice was significantly lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice; however, there was no difference in the concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc between two independent mutants and the wild type. The Cu concentration of xylem sap was lower in the mutants than in the wild-type rice. OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage. The expression was up-regulated by excess Cu but not by the deficiency of Cu and other metals, including zinc, iron, and manganese, at the vegetative stage. Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk. Furthermore, immunostaining with an antibody against OsHMA5 revealed that it was localized to the plasma membrane. Expression of OsHMA5 in a Cu transport-defective mutant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain restored the growth. Taken together, OsHMA5 is involved in loading Cu to the xylem of the roots and other organs.
24014866	The rare sugar D-allose acts as a triggering molecule of rice defence via ROS generation.	2013	J Exp Bot	Only D-allose, among various rare monosaccharides tested, induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in susceptible rice leaves with defence responses: reactive oxygen species, lesion mimic formation, and PR-protein gene expression. These responses were suppressed by ascorbic acid or diphenylene iodonium. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsrbohC, encoding NADPH oxidase, were enhanced in sensitivity to D-allose. D-Allose-mediated defence responses were suppressed by the presence of a hexokinase inhibitor. 6-Deoxy-D-allose, a structural derivative of D-allose unable to be phosphorylated, did not confer resistance. Transgenic rice plants expressing Escherichia coli AlsK encoding D-allose kinase to increase D-allose 6-phosphate synthesis were more sensitive to D-allose, but E. coli AlsI encoding D-allose 6-phosphate isomerase expression to decrease D-allose 6-phosphate reduced sensitivity. A D-glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-defective mutant was also less sensitive, and OsG6PDH1 complementation restored full sensitivity. These results reveal that a monosaccharide, D-allose, induces rice resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae by activating NADPH oxidase through the activity of D-glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, initiated by hexokinase-mediated conversion of D-allose to D-allose 6-phosphate, and treatment with D-allose might prove to be useful for reducing disease development in rice.
24052265	Structural analysis of a calmodulin variant from rice: the C-terminal extension of OsCaM61 regulates its calcium binding and enzyme activation properties.	2013	J Biol Chem	OsCaM61 is one of five calmodulins known to be present in Oryza sativa that relays the increase of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] to downstream targets. OsCaM61 bears a unique C-terminal extension with a prenylation site. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we studied the behavior of the calmodulin (CaM) domain and the C-terminal extension of OsCaM61 in the absence and presence of Ca(2+). NMR dynamics data for OsCaM61 indicate that the two lobes of the CaM domain act together unlike the independent behavior of the lobes seen in mammalian CaM and soybean CaM4. Also, data demonstrate that the positively charged nuclear localization signal region in the tail in apo-OsCaM61 is helical, whereas it becomes flexible in the Ca(2+)-saturated protein. The extra helix in apo-OsCaM61 provides additional interactions in the C-lobe and increases the structural stability of the closed apo conformation. This leads to a decrease in the Ca(2+) binding affinity of EF-hands III and IV in OsCaM61. In Ca(2+)-OsCaM61, the basic nuclear localization signal cluster adopts an extended conformation, exposing the C-terminal extension for prenylation or enabling OsCaM61 to be transferred to the nucleus. Moreover, Ser(172) and Ala(173), residues in the tail, interact with different regions of the protein. These interactions affect the ability of OsCaM61 to activate different target proteins. Altogether, our data show that the tail is not simply a linker between the prenyl group and the protein but that it also provides a new regulatory mechanism that some plants have developed to fine-tune Ca(2+) signaling events.
24033451	Light induces jasmonate-isoleucine conjugation via OsJAR1-dependent and -independent pathways in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	The bioactive form of jasmonate is the conjugate of the amino acid isoleucine (Ile) with jasmonic acid (JA), which is biosynthesized in a reaction catalysed by the GH3 enzyme JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1). We examined the biochemical properties of OsJAR1 and its involvement in photomorphogenesis of rice (Oryza sativa). OsJAR1 has a similar substrate specificities as its orthologue in Arabidopsis. However, osjar1 loss-of-function mutants did not show as severe coleoptile phenotypes as the JA-deficient mutants coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, which develop long coleoptiles in all light qualities we examined. Analysis of hormonal contents in the young seedling stage revealed that osjar1 mutants are still able to synthesize JA-Ile conjugate in response to blue light, suggesting that a redundantly active enzyme can conjugate JA and Ile in rice seedlings. A good candidate for this enzyme is OsJAR2, which was found to be able to catalyse the conjugation of JA with Ile as well as with some additional amino acids. In contrast, if plants in the vegetative stage were mechanically wounded, the content of JA-Ile was severely reduced in osjar1, demonstrating that OsJAR1 is the most important JA-Ile conjugating enzyme in the wounding response during the vegetative stage.
23938390	Down-regulation of OsSAG12-1 results in enhanced senescence and pathogen-induced cell death in transgenic rice plants.	2013	J Biosci	Senescence is a highly regulated process accompanied by changes in gene expression. While the mRNA levels of most genes decline, the mRNA levels of specific genes (senescence associated genes, SAGs) increase during senescence. Arabidopsis SAG12 (AtSAG12) gene codes for papain-like cysteine protease. The promoter of AtSAG12 is SA-responsive and reported to be useful to delay senescence by expressing cytokinin biosynthesis gene isopentenyltransferase specifically during senescence in several plants including Arabidopsis, lettuce and rice. The physiological role of AtSAG12 is not known; the homozygous atsag12 mutant neither fails to develop senescenceassociated vacuoles nor shows any morphological phenotype. Through BLAST search using AtSAG12 amino acid sequences as query, we identified a few putative homologues from rice genome (OsSAGs; Oryza sativa SAGs). OsSAG12-1 is the closest homologue of AtSAG12 with 64% similar amino acid composition. Expression of OsSAG12-1 is induced during senescence and pathogen-induced cell death. To evaluate the possible role of OsSAG12-1 we generated RNAi transgenic lines in Japonica rice cultivar TP309. The transgenic lines developed early senescence at varying levels and showed enhanced cell death when inoculated with bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae. Our results suggest that OsSAG12-1 is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.
24014863	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice.	2013	J Exp Bot	Iron (Fe) is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. Acquisition of Fe by plants is mediated by a complex network involving Fe mobilization, uptake by root cells, and transport within plants. Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants. Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium. Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions. OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively. Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants. These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.
24020752	OsFIE2 plays an essential role in the regulation of rice vegetative and reproductive development.	2014	New Phytol	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are gene repressors that help to maintain cellular identity during development via chromatin remodeling. Fertilization-independent endosperm (FIE), a member of the PcG complex, operates extensively in plant development, but its role in rice has not been fully investigated to date. We report the isolation and characterization of a PcG member in rice, which was designated OsFIE2 for Oryza sativa Fertilization-Independent Endosperm 2. OsFIE2 is a single-copy gene in the rice genome and shows a universal expression pattern. The OsFIE2 RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic phenotypes in vegetative and reproductive organ generation. In unfertilized lines, endosperm formation could be triggered without embryo formation, which indicates that FIE is indeed involved in the suppression of autonomous endosperm development in rice. Furthermore, lateral root generation was promoted early in the roots of OsFIE2 RNAi lines, whereas the primary root was premature and highly differentiated. As the root tip stem cell differentiated, QHB, the gene required for stem cell maintenance in the quiescent center, was down-regulated. Our data suggest that the OsFIE2-PcG complex is vital for rice reproduction and endosperm formation. Its role in stem cell maintenance suggests that the gene is functionally conserved in plants as well as animals.
24268160	A proteomic study of rice cultivar TNG67 and its high aroma mutant SA0420.	2014	Plant Sci	Fragrance is a very important economic trait for rice cultivars. To identify the aroma genes in rice, we performed a proteomics analysis of aroma-related proteins between Tainung 67 (TNG67) and its high aroma mutant SA0420. Seventeen of the differentially identified proteins were close related with the aroma phenotype of SA0420. Among them, 9 were found in leaves and 8 were found in grains. One protein (L3) was identified as the chloroplastic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase B (OsGAPDHB) which was less abundant in SA0420 than TNG67. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this protein in SA0420 carries a P425S mutation in the C-terminal extension domain, which might hinder the formation of holoenzyme, thereby changing the profile of aroma compounds. The protein profile of OsGAPDHB showed only a weak correlation to its transcription profile. This result indicated that the reduction of OsGAPDHB in SA0420 is regulated by post-translational processes and can only be analyzed by proteomics approach. Transgenic lines suppressing OsGAPDHB through RNAi harbored more fragrance than TNG67 but less than SA0420. With betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase as the only fragrance gene identified in rice to date, OsGAPDHB may serve as the second protein known to contribute to the aroma phenotype.
24006427	Rice CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE-RESPONSE2 is involved in the ethylene-receptor signalling and regulation of various aspects of rice growth and development.	2013	J Exp Bot	In Arabidopsis, the ethylene-receptor signal output occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum and is mediated by the Raf-like protein CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1) but is prevented by overexpression of the CTR1 N terminus. A phylogenic analysis suggested that rice OsCTR2 is closely related to CTR1, and ectopic expression of CTR1p:OsCTR2 complemented Arabidopsis ctr1-1. Arabidopsis ethylene receptors ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 physically interacted with OsCTR2 on yeast two-hybrid assay, and green fluorescence protein-tagged OsCTR2 was localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. The osctr2 loss-of-function mutation and expression of the 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgene that encodes the OsCTR2 N terminus (residues 1-513) revealed several and many aspects, respectively, of ethylene-induced growth alteration in rice. Because the osctr2 allele did not produce all aspects of ethylene-induced growth alteration, the ethylene-receptor signal output might be mediated in part by OsCTR2 and by other components in rice. Yield-related agronomic traits, including flowering time and effective tiller number, were altered in osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines. Applying prolonged ethylene treatment to evaluate ethylene effects on rice without compromising rice growth is technically challenging. Our understanding of roles of ethylene in various aspects of growth and development in japonica rice varieties could be advanced with the use of the osctr2 and 35S:OsCTR2 (1-513) transgenic lines.
24265852	Multiple abiotic stress responsive rice cyclophilin: (OsCYP-25) mediates a wide range of cellular responses.	2013	Commun Integr Biol	Cyclophilins (CYP), a member of immunophillin group of proteins, are more often conserved in all genera including plants. Here, we report on the identification of a new cyclophilin gene OsCYP-25 (LOC_Os09 g39780) from rice which found to be upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses viz., salinity, cold, heat and drought. It has an ORF of 540 bp, encoding a protein of 179 amino acids, consisting of PPIase domain, which is highly conserved. The OsCYP-25 promoter analysis revealed that different cis-regulatory elements (e.g., MYBCORE, MYC, CBFHV, GT1GMSCAM4, DRECRTCOREAT, CCAATBOX1, WRKY71OS and WBOXATNPR1) are involved to mediate OsCYP-25 response under stress. We have also predicted interacting partners by STRING software. In interactome, protein partners includes WD domain containing protein, the 60S ribosome subunit biogenesis protein, the ribosomal protein L10, the DEAD-box helicase, the EIF-2α, YT521-B protein, the 60S ribosomal protein and the PPR repeat domain containing protein. The in silico analysis showed that OsCYP-25 interacts with different proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, RNA editing, gene expression, signal transduction or stress response. These findings suggest that OsCYP-25 might perform an important function in mediating wide range of cellular response under multiple abiotic stresses.
24019919	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae type III effector XopN targets OsVOZ2 and a putative thiamine synthase as a virulence factor in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is spread systemically through the xylem tissue and causes bacterial blight in rice. We evaluated the roles of Xanthomonas outer proteins (Xop) in the Xoo strain KXO85 in a Japonica-type rice cultivar, Dongjin. Five xop gene knockout mutants (xopQ KXO85 , xopX KXO85 , xopP1 KXO85 , xopP2 KXO85 , and xopN KXO85 ) were generated by EZ-Tn5 mutagenesis, and their virulence was assessed in 3-month-old rice leaves. Among these mutants, the xopN KXO85 mutant appeared to be less virulent than the wild-type KXO85; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the xopN KXO85 mutant exhibited significantly less virulence in flag leaves after flowering than the wild-type KXO85. These observations indicate that the roles of Xop in Xoo virulence are dependent on leaf stage. We chose the xopN gene for further characterization because the xopN KXO85 mutant showed the greatest influence on virulence. We confirmed that XopNKXO85 is translocated into rice cells, and its gene expression is positively regulated by HrpX. Two rice proteins, OsVOZ2 and a putative thiamine synthase (OsXNP), were identified as targets of XopNKXO85 by yeast two-hybrid screening. Interactions between XopNKXO85 and OsVOZ2 and OsXNP were further confirmed in planta by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vivo pull-down assays. To investigate the roles of OsVOZ2 in interactions between rice and Xoo, we evaluated the virulence of the wild-type KXO85 and xopN KXO85 mutant in the OsVOZ2 mutant line PFG_3A-07565 of Dongjin. The wild-type KXO85 and xopN KXO85 mutant were significantly less virulent in the mutant rice line. These results indicate that XopNKXO85 and OsVOZ2 play important roles both individually and together for Xoo virulence in rice.
24254313	Unusual small subunit that is not expressed in photosynthetic cells alters the catalytic properties of rubisco in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Rubisco small subunits (RbcSs) are encoded by a nuclear multigene family in plants. Five RbcS genes, OsRbcS1, OsRbcS2, OsRbcS3, OsRbcS4, and OsRbcS5, have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). Among them, the amino acid sequence of OsRbcS1 differs notably from those of other rice RbcSs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsRbcS1 is genetically distant from other rice RbcS genes and more closely related to RbcS from a fern and two woody plants. Reverse transcription-PCR and promoter β-glucuronidase analyses revealed that OsRbcS1 was not expressed in leaf blade, a major photosynthetic organ in rice, but was expressed in leaf sheath, culm, anther, and root central cylinder. In leaf blade of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRbcS1 and leaf sheath of nontransgenic rice, OsRbcS1 was incorporated into the Rubisco holoenzyme. Incorporation of OsRbcS1 into Rubisco increased the catalytic turnover rate and Km for CO2 of the enzyme and slightly decreased the specificity for CO2, indicating that the catalytic properties were shifted to those of a high-activity type Rubisco. The CO2 assimilation rate at low CO2 partial pressure was decreased in overexpression lines but was not changed under ambient and high CO2 partial pressure compared with nontransgenic rice. Although the Rubisco content was increased, Rubisco activation state was decreased in overexpression lines. These results indicate that the catalytic properties of Rubisco can be altered by ectopic expression of OsRbcS1, with substantial effects on photosynthetic performance in rice. We believe this is the first demonstration of organ-specific expression of individual members of the RbcS gene family resulting in marked effects on Rubisco catalytic activity.
24223786	Increase in cellulose accumulation and improvement of saccharification by overexpression of arabinofuranosidase in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Cellulosic biomass is available for the production of biofuel, with saccharification of the cell wall being a key process. We investigated whether alteration of arabinoxylan, a major hemicellulose in monocots, causes an increase in saccharification efficiency. Arabinoxylans have β-1,4-D-xylopyranosyl backbones and 1,3- or 1,4-α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues linked to O-2 and/or O-3 of xylopyranosyl residues as side chains. Arabinose side chains interrupt the hydrogen bond between arabinoxylan and cellulose and carry an ester-linked feruloyl substituent. Arabinose side chains are the base point for diferuloyl cross-links and lignification. We analyzed rice plants overexpressing arabinofuranosidase (ARAF) to study the role of arabinose residues in the cell wall and their effects on saccharification. Arabinose content in the cell wall of transgenic rice plants overexpressing individual ARAF full-length cDNA (OsARAF1-FOX and OsARAF3-FOX) decreased 25% and 20% compared to the control and the amount of glucose increased by 28.2% and 34.2%, respectively. We studied modifications of cell wall polysaccharides at the cellular level by comparing histochemical cellulose staining patterns and immunolocalization patterns using antibodies raised against α-(1,5)-linked l-Ara (LM6) and β-(1,4)-linked d-Xyl (LM10 and LM11) residues. However, they showed no visible phenotype. Our results suggest that the balance between arabinoxylan and cellulose might maintain the cell wall network. Moreover, ARAF overexpression in rice effectively leads to an increase in cellulose accumulation and saccharification efficiency, which can be used to produce bioethanol.
24163402	Rice DEP1, encoding a highly cysteine-rich G protein γ subunit, confers cadmium tolerance on yeast cells and plants.	2013	J Exp Bot	A rice cDNA, OsDEP1, encoding a highly cysteine (Cys)-rich G protein γ subunit, was initially identified as it conferred cadmium (Cd) tolerance on yeast cells. Of the 426 aa constituting OsDEP1, 120 are Cys residues (28.2%), of which 88 are clustered in the C-terminal half region (aa 170-426). To evaluate the independent effects of these two regions, two truncated versions of the OsDEP1-expressing plasmids pOsDEP1(1-169) and pOsDEP1(170-426) were used to examine their effects on yeast Cd tolerance. Although OsDEP1(170-426) conferred a similar level of Cd tolerance as the intact OsDEP1, OsDEP1(1-169) provided no such tolerance, indicating that the tolerance effect is localized to the aa 170-426 C-terminal peptide region. The Cd responses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing OsDEP1, OsDEP1(1-169) or OsDEP1(170-426), were similar to the observations in yeast cells, with OsDEP1 and OsDEP1(170-426) transgenic plants displaying Cd tolerance but OsDEP1(1-169) plants showing no such tolerance. In addition, a positive correlation between the transcript levels of OsDEP1 or OsDEP1(170-426) in the transgenics and the Cd content of these plants upon Cd application was observed. As several Arabidopsis loss-of-function heterotrimeric G protein β and γ subunit gene mutants did not show differences in their Cd sensitivity compared with wild-type plants, we propose that the Cys-rich region of OsDEP1 may function directly as a trap for Cd ions.
24189206	Comparative transcriptome profiles of the WRKY gene family under control, hormone-treated, and drought conditions in near-isogenic rice lines reveal differential, tissue specific gene activation.	2014	J Plant Physiol	The OsWRKY genes play various roles in developmental processes and in stress-related responses in plants. We describe the rice OsWRKY gene expression profiles (GEPs) under control, hormone-treated, and water-deficit treatment (WDT) conditions. The preferential expression of 3 genes was observed in specific tissues, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in the root and panicle stages of growth. To investigate the GEPs in the root and panicle of 3 rice genotypes, we used 2 near-isogenic rice lines from a common genetic combination backcross developed by Aday Selection and IR64. WDTs were applied using the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) for severe, mild, and control conditions. Transcriptomic analysis using a 44K oligoarray from Affymetrix and Agilent was performed on all the tissues. The majority of the OsWRKY genes that were activated were activated in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line but not in the drought-susceptible IR77298-14-1-2-B-13 or IR64 lines. In IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, non-redundant genes (9) were very specific in their higher expression levels. Approximately 27 and 43% more genes from group III and subgroup IV-a, respectively, were activated in the panicle during severe stress than during the control treatment. We found 5 OsWRKY genes that introgressed in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line. Os01g43650 was up-regulated in the root under both WDTs and in the panicle under mild stress. OsWRKY up-regulated genes with tissue-specific expression patterns that contained at least 3 cis-elements in the tolerant line. These results provide a useful reference for the cloning of candidate genes for further functional analysis.
24253678	Iron-binding haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation.	2013	Nat Commun	Iron is essential for most living organisms. Plants transcriptionally induce genes involved in iron acquisition under conditions of low iron availability, but the nature of the deficiency signal and its sensors are unknown. Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2. OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity. OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions. OsHRZ-knockdown plants exhibit substantial tolerance to iron deficiency, and accumulate more iron in their shoots and grains irrespective of soil iron conditions. The expression of iron deficiency-inducible genes involved in iron utilization is enhanced in OsHRZ-knockdown plants, mostly under iron-sufficient conditions. These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency.
24247850	Overexpression of a new stress-repressive gene OsDSR2 encoding a protein with a DUF966 domain increases salt and simulated drought stress sensitivities and reduces ABA sensitivity in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Domain of Unknown Function 966 (DUF966) gene family was found in the protein family database, which consisted of seven genes in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contained one or two highly conserved DUF966 domains. The available data of public microarray databases implied that these genes might play crucial roles in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (OsDSR2, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized. OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice. Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments. Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus. Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C. Furthermore, OsDSR2-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage. These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
24282069	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	Glutelins are the most abundant storage proteins in rice grain and can make up to 80 % of total protein content. The promoter region of GluB-1, one of the glutelin genes in rice, has been intensively used as a model to understand regulation of seed-storage protein accumulation. In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey. The OsGZF1 protein binds specifically to the bait sequence in yeast and this interaction was confirmed in vitro. OsGZF1 is predominantly expressed in a confined domain surrounding the scutellum of the developing embryo and is localised in the nucleus. Transient expression experiments demonstrated that OsGZF1 can down-regulate a GluB-1-GUS (β-glucuronidase) reporter and OsGZF1 was also able to significantly reduce activation conferred by RISBZ1 which is a known strong GluB-1 activator. Furthermore, down-regulation of OsGZF1 by an RNAi approach increased grain nitrogen concentration. We propose that OsGZF1 has a function in regulating the GluB-1 promoter and controls accumulation of glutelins during grain development.
24251791	Nicotianamine synthase 2 localizes to the vesicles of iron-deficient rice roots, and its mutation in the YXXφ or LL motif causes the disruption of vesicle formation or movement in rice.	2014	Plant J	Graminaceous plants release mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the soil. Here, we show that deoxymugineic acid (DMA) secretion from rice roots fluctuates throughout the day, and that vesicles accumulate in roots before MAs secretion. We developed transgenic rice plants that express rice nicotianamine (NA) synthase (NAS) 2 (OsNAS2) fused to synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) under the control of its own promoter. In root cells, OsNAS2-sGFP fluorescence was observed in a dot-like pattern, moving dynamically within the cell. This suggests that these vesicles are involved in NA and DMA biosynthesis. A tyrosine motif and a di-leucine motif, which have been reported to be involved in cellular transport, are conserved in all identified NAS proteins in plants. OsNAS2 mutated in the tyrosine motif showed NAS activity and was localized to the vesicles; however, these vesicles stuck together and did not move. On the other hand, OsNAS2 mutated in the di-leucine motif lost NAS activity and did not localize to these vesicles. The amounts of NA and DMA produced and the amount of DMA secreted by OsNAS2-sGFP plants were significantly higher than in non-transformants and domain-mutated lines, suggesting that OsNAS2-sGFP, but not the mutated forms, was functional in vivo. Overall, the localization of NAS to vesicles and the transport of these vesicles are crucial steps in NA synthesis, leading to DMA synthesis and secretion in rice.
24258242	Nitrogen fertilizer increases spikelet number per panicle by enhancing cytokinin synthesis in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Flower number per panicle is one of the most important traits in rice productivity determination. The number of flowers is established in the early stages of panicle development. Nitrogen fertilizer application before panicle initiation is well known to increase flower number. Nitrogen increases cytokinin (CKs) biosynthesis in plants, and CKs have very similar effects as nitrogen fertilizer on panicle branching. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer on panicle branching may be mediated by CKs, in which accumulation in the inflorescence meristem can regulate panicle development, resulting in increased numbers of flowers and branches. Adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of CKs biosynthesis. We analyzed the effect of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) on the expression of OsIPT genes (OsIPTs). The results showed that OsIPTs were markedly increased, and CKs accumulated in panicle when nitrogen fertilizer was applied. CKs biosynthesis in the roots and leaves was not up-regulated by nitrogen. These results suggest that nitrogen fertilizer enhances local CKs synthesis to increase flower numbers in the panicles of rice. Localized CKs biosynthesis is an important response to nitrogen.
24279300	Overexpression of OsPIL15, a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein gene, represses etiolated seedling growth in rice.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) regulate an array of developmental responses ranging from seed germination to vegetational architecture in Arabidopsis. However, information regarding the functions of the PIF family in monocots has not been widely reported. Here, we investigate the roles of OsPIL15, a member of the rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) PIF family, in regulating seedling growth. OsPIL15 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix factor localized in the nucleus. OsPIL15-OX seedlings exhibit an exaggerated shorter aboveground part and undeveloped root system relative to wild-type seedlings, suggesting that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth in the dark. Microarray analysis combined with gene ontology analysis revealed that OsPIL15 represses a set of genes involved in auxin pathways and cell wall organization or biogenesis. Given the important roles of the auxin pathway and cell wall properties in controlling plant growth, we speculate that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth likely by regulating the auxin pathway and suppressing cell wall organization in etiolated rice seedlings. Additionally, exposure to red light or far-red light relieved growth retardation and promoted seedling elongation in the OsPIL15-OX lines, despite higher levels of OsPIL15 transcripts under red light and far-red light than in the dark. These results suggest that light regulation of OsPIL15 expression is probably involved in photomorphogenesis in rice.
24286292	Genome-wide expressional and functional analysis of calcium transport elements during abiotic stress and development in rice.	2014	FEBS J	Ca²⁺ homeostasis is required to maintain a delicate balance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ during normal and adverse growth conditions. Various Ca²⁺ transporters actively participate to maintain this delicate balance especially during abiotic stresses and developmental events in plants. In this study, we present a genome-wide account, detailing expression profiles, subcellular localization and functional analysis of rice Ca²⁺ transport elements. Exhaustive in silico data mining and analysis resulted in the identification of 81 Ca²⁺ transport element genes, which belong to various groups such as Ca²⁺-ATPases (pumps), exchangers, channels, glutamate receptor homologs and annexins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that different Ca²⁺ transporters are evolutionarily conserved across different plant species. Comprehensive expression analysis by gene chip microarray and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that a substantial proportion of Ca²⁺ transporter genes were expressed differentially under abiotic stresses (salt, cold and drought) and reproductive developmental stages (panicle and seed) in rice. These findings suggest a possible role of rice Ca²⁺ transporters in abiotic stress and development triggered signaling pathways. Subcellular localization of Ca²⁺ transporters from different groups in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed their variable localization to different compartments, which could be their possible sites of action. Complementation of Ca²⁺ transport activity of K616 yeast mutant by Ca²⁺-ATPase OsACA7 and involvement in salt tolerance verified its functional behavior. This study will encourage detailed characterization of potential candidate Ca²⁺ transporters for their functional role in planta.
24103067	Loss-of-function of OsSTN8 suppresses the photosystem II core protein phosphorylation and interferes with the photosystem II repair mechanism in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Plant J	STN8 kinase is involved in photosystem II (PSII) core protein phosphorylation (PCPP). To examine the role of PCPP in PSII repair during high light (HL) illumination, we characterized a T-DNA insertional knockout mutant of the rice (Oryza sativa) STN8 gene. In this osstn8 mutant, PCPP was significantly suppressed, and the grana were thin and elongated. Upon HL illumination, PSII was strongly inactivated in the mutants, but the D1 protein was degraded more slowly than in wild-type, and mobilization of the PSII supercomplexes from the grana to the stromal lamellae for repair was also suppressed. In addition, higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species and preferential oxidation of PSII reaction center core proteins in thylakoid membranes were observed in the mutants during HL illumination. Taken together, our current data show that the absence of STN8 is sufficient to abolish PCPP in osstn8 mutants and to produce all of the phenotypes observed in the double mutant of Arabidopsis, indicating the essential role of STN8-mediated PCPP in PSII repair.
24212861	Distribution and organization of a tandemly repeated 352-bp sequence in the oryzae family.	1991	Theor Appl Genet	A 352-bp EcoRI fragment from rice DNA was cloned and shown to be a member of a tandem repeat. Sequence determination revealed homologies with human alpha satellite DNA and maize knob heterochromatin specific repeat. This 352-bp sequence is highly specific for the AA genome of rice. However, copy number and sequence organization are variable, depending on the accession analyzed. Several examples of amplification were observed in O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata. Use of resolutive polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 4-bp cutter enzymes allowed one to distinguish between the Indica and Japonica subtypes of O. sativa. The same method also discriminates between two groups of O. rufipogon, the presumed ancestor of O. sativa, suggesting that the present day Indica and Japonica subtypes originated independently from two O. rufipogon distinct populations.
22730405	A plasma membrane receptor kinase, GHR1, mediates abscisic acid- and hydrogen peroxide-regulated stomatal movement in Arabidopsis.	2012	Plant Cell	The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates stomatal movement under drought stress, and this regulation requires hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We isolated GUARD CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1 (GHR1), which encodes a receptor-like kinase localized on the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis thaliana. ghr1 mutants were defective ABA and H2O2 induction of stomatal closure. Genetic analysis indicates that GHR1 is a critical early component in ABA signaling. The ghr1 mutation impaired ABA- and H2O2-regulated activation of S-type anion currents in guard cells. Furthermore, GHR1 physically interacted with, phosphorylated, and activated the S-type anion channel SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED1 when coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and this activation was inhibited by ABA-INSENSITIVE2 (ABI2) but not ABI1. Our study identifies a critical component in ABA and H2O2 signaling that is involved in stomatal movement and resolves a long-standing mystery about the differential functions of ABI1 and ABI2 in this process.
24058148	Nitrogen-dependent regulation of de novo cytokinin biosynthesis in rice: the role of glutamine metabolism as an additional signal.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytokinin activity in plants is closely related to nitrogen availability, and an Arabidopsis gene for adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT), IPT3, is regulated by inorganic nitrogen sources in a nitrate-specific manner. In this study, we have identified another regulatory system of cytokinin de novo biosynthesis in response to nitrogen status. In rice, OsIPT4, OsIPT5, OsIPT7 and OsIPT8 were up-regulated in response to exogenously applied nitrate and ammonium, with accompanying accumulation of cytokinins. Pre-treatment of roots with l-methionine sulfoximine, a potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, abolished the nitrate- and ammonium-dependent induction of OsIPT4 and OsIPT5, while glutamine application induced their expression. Thus, neither nitrate nor ammonium, but glutamine or a related metabolite, is essential for the induction of these IPT genes in rice. On the other hand, glutamine-dependent induction of IPT3 occurs in Arabidopsis, at least to some extent. In transgenic lines repressing the expression of OsIPT4, which is the dominant IPT in rice roots, the nitrogen-dependent increase of cytokinin in the xylem sap was significantly reduced, and seedling shoot growth was retarded despite sufficient nitrogen. We conclude that plants possess multiple regulation systems for nitrogen-dependent cytokinin biosynthesis to modulate growth in response to nitrogen availability.
24240868	Natural variation in PTB1 regulates rice seed setting rate by controlling pollen tube growth.	2013	Nat Commun	Grain number, panicle seed setting rate, panicle number and grain weight are the most important components of rice grain yield. To date, several genes related to grain weight, grain number and panicle number have been described in rice. However, no genes regulating the panicle seed setting rate have been functionally characterized. Here we show that the domestication-related POLLEN TUBE BLOCKED 1 (PTB1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, positively regulates the rice panicle seed setting rate by promoting pollen tube growth. The natural variation in expression of PTB1 which is affected by the promoter haplotype and the environmental temperature, correlates with the rice panicle seed setting rate. Our results support the hypothesis that PTB1 is an important maternal sporophytic factor of pollen tube growth and a key modulator of the rice panicle seed setting rate. This finding has implications for the improvement of rice yield.
24272791	cDNA cloning of an mRNA encoding a sulfur-rich 10 kDa prolamin polypeptide in rice seeds.	1989	Plant Mol Biol	Using a rice maturing seed pUC9 expression library, we isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to 10 kDa sulfurrich prolamin by immunoscreening. A longer cDNA clone was obtained from a λgtll library by plaque hybridization using this (32)P-labeled cDNA as a probe. A polypeptide sequence composed of 134 amino acids was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. A 24 amino acid signal peptide was assigned by computer calculation for the membrane spanning region and Edman sequencing of the purified mature polypeptide. Remarkably, 20% of methionine and 10% of cysteine were found in the mature polypeptide as well as high contents of glutamine, and hydrophobic amino acids. Part of the amino acid sequence was homologous with a conserved cysteine-rich region found in other plant prolamins. Two repeats of amino acid sequence were found in the polypeptide.
24169660	Homologous recombination mediated by two palindromic repeated sequences in the mitochondrial genome of Oryza.	1995	Theor Appl Genet	Palindromic repeated sequences (PRSs) are distributed in at least ten regions of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of rice and are, apparently, mobile. In the present study, we examined the possibility of homologous recombination via some PRSs during the course of evolution of Oryza. We first performed Southern hybridization of the DNA from 11 species (18 strains) of Oryza in order to identify the distribution of PRSs in the mitochondrial genome of Oryza. The hybridization patterns revealed genome type-specific and/or species-specific variations. We speculated that homologous recombination via some PRSs might have made a contribution to such variations. After subsequent polymerase chain reaction, Southern hybridization and sequencing, we concluded that homologous recombination mediated by two PRSs occurred in the mtDNA of Oryza after divergence of the BB genome type and the other genome types of Oryza. Evidence was obtained that some PRSs were involved in both insertion and recombination events during the evolution of Oryza. Our results indicate, therefore, that PRSs have contributed considerably to the polymorphism of Oryza mtDNAs.
23852329	Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing and transcriptional analysis to uncover an RT102-type cytoplasmic male sterility-associated candidate Gene Derived from Oryza rufipogon.	2013	Plant Cell Physiol	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait in which plants fail to produce functional pollen and is associated with the expression of a novel open reading frame (orf) gene encoded by the mitochondrial genome. An RT102A CMS line and an RT102C fertility restorer line were obtained by successive backcrossing between Oryza rufipogon W1125 and O. sativa Taichung 65. Using next-generation pyrosequencing, we determined whole-genome sequences of the mitochondria in RT102-CMS cytoplasm. To identify candidates for the CMS-associated gene in RT102 mitochondria, we screened the mitochondrial genome for the presence of specific orf genes that were chimeric or whose products carried predicted transmembrane domains. One of these orf genes, orf352, which showed different transcript sizes depending on whether the restorer of fertility (Rf) gene was present or not, was identified. The orf352 gene was co-transcribed with the ribosomal protein gene rpl5, and the 2.8 kb rpl5-orf352 transcripts were processed into 2.6 kb transcripts with a cleavage at the inside of the orf352 coding region in the presence of the Rf gene. The orf352 gene is an excellent candidate for the CMS-associated gene for RT102-CMS.
23944999	A recessive resistance to rice yellow mottle virus is associated with a rice homolog of the CPR5 gene, a regulator of active defense mechanisms.	2013	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	RYMV2 is a major recessive resistance gene identified in cultivated African rice (Oryza glaberrima) which confers high resistance to the Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV). We mapped RYMV2 in an approximately 30-kb interval in which four genes have been annotated. Sequencing of the candidate region in the resistant Tog7291 accession revealed a single mutation affecting a predicted gene, as compared with the RYMV-susceptible O. glaberrima CG14 reference sequence. This mutation was found to be a one-base deletion leading to a truncated and probably nonfunctional protein. It affected a gene homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana CPR5 gene, known to be a defense mechanism regulator. Only seven O. glaberrima accessions showing this deletion were identified in a collection consisting of 417 accessions from three rice species. All seven accessions were resistant to RYMV, which is an additional argument in favor of the involvement of the deletion in resistance. In addition, fine mapping of a resistance quantitative trait locus in O. sativa advanced backcrossed lines pinpointed a 151-kb interval containing RYMV2, suggesting that allelic variants of the same gene may control both high and partial resistance.
23681551	Heterologous expression of rice calnexin (OsCNX) confers drought tolerance in Nicotiana tabacum.	2013	Mol Biol Rep	Calnexin (CNX) is an integral membrane protein of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a critical component of ER quality control machinery. It acts as a chaperone and ensures proper folding of newly synthesised glycoproteins. CNX shares a considerable homology with its luminal counterpart calreticulin (CRT). Together, they constitute CNX/CRT cycle which is imperative for proper folding of nascent proteins. CNX deficient organisms develop severe complications because of improper folding of proteins and consequently ER stress. CNX maintains calcium homeostasis by binding to the Ca(2+) which is a central node in various signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tail of CNX controls the sarco endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and thus the movement of Ca(2+) in and out of its store-house, i.e. ER. Our studies on Oryza sativa CNX (OsCNX) reveal constitutive expression at various developmental stages and various tissues, thereby proving its requirement throughout the plant development. Further, its expression under various stress conditions gives an insight of the crosstalk existing between ER stress and abiotic stress signaling. This was confirmed by heterologous expression of OsCNX (OsCNX-HE) in tobacco and the OsCNX-HE lines were observed to exhibit better germination under mannitol stress and survival under dehydration stress conditions. The dehydration tolerance conferred by OsCNX appears to be ABA-dependent pathway.
23859433	The role of Bh4 in parallel evolution of hull colour in domesticated and weedy rice.	2013	J Evol Biol	The two independent domestication events in the genus Oryza that led to African and Asian rice offer an extremely useful system for studying the genetic basis of parallel evolution. This system is also characterized by parallel de-domestication events, with two genetically distinct weedy rice biotypes in the US derived from the Asian domesticate. One important trait that has been altered by rice domestication and de-domestication is hull colour. The wild progenitors of the two cultivated rice species have predominantly black-coloured hulls, as does one of the two U.S. weed biotypes; both cultivated species and one of the US weedy biotypes are characterized by straw-coloured hulls. Using Black hull 4 (Bh4) as a hull colour candidate gene, we examined DNA sequence variation at this locus to study the parallel evolution of hull colour variation in the domesticated and weedy rice system. We find that independent Bh4-coding mutations have arisen in African and Asian rice that are correlated with the straw hull phenotype, suggesting that the same gene is responsible for parallel trait evolution. For the U.S. weeds, Bh4 haplotype sequences support current hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationship between the two biotypes and domesticated Asian rice; straw hull weeds are most similar to indica crops, and black hull weeds are most similar to aus crops. Tests for selection indicate that Asian crops and straw hull weeds deviate from neutrality at this gene, suggesting possible selection on Bh4 during both rice domestication and de-domestication.
24148990	Phylogenetic relationships and genome divergence among the AA- genome species of the genus Oryza as revealed by 53 nuclear genes and 16 intergenic regions.	2014	Mol Phylogenet Evol	Rapid radiations have long been regarded as the most challenging issue for elucidating poorly resolved phylogenies in evolutionary biology. The eight diploid AA- genome species in the genus Oryza represent a typical example of a closely spaced series of recent speciation events in plants. However, questions regarding when and how they diversified have long been an issue of extensive interest but remain a mystery. Here, a data set comprising >60 kb of 53 singleton fragments and 16 intergenic regions is used to perform phylogenomic analyses of all eight AA- genome species plus four diploid Oryza species with BB-, CC-, EE- and GG- genomes. We fully reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of AA- genome species with confidence. Oryza meridionalis, native to Australia, is found to be the earliest divergent lineage around 2.93 mya, whereas O. punctata, a BB- genome species, serves as the best outgroup to distinguish their phylogenetic relationships. They separated from O. punctata approximately 9.11 mya during the Miocene epoch, and subsequently radiated to generate the entire AA- genome lineage diversity. The success in resolving the phylogeny of AA- genome species highlights the potential of phylogenomics to determine their divergence and evolutionary histories.
14605232	Impaired induction of the jasmonate pathway in the rice mutant hebiba.	2003	Plant Physiol	The elongation of rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles is inhibited by light, and this photoinhibition was used to screen for mutants with impaired light response. In one of the isolated mutants, hebiba, coleoptile elongation was stimulated in the presence of red light, but inhibited in the dark. Light responses of endogenous indolyl-3-acetic acid and abscisic acid were identical between the wild type and the mutant. In contrast, the wild type showed a dramatic increase of jasmonate heralded by corresponding increases in the content of its precursor o-phytodienoic acid, whereas both compounds were not detectable in the mutant. The jasmonate response to wounding was also blocked in the mutant. The mutant phenotype was rescued by addition of exogenous methyl jasmonate and o-phytodienoic acid. Moreover, the expression of O. sativa 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase, an early gene of jasmonic acid-synthesis, is induced by red light in the wild type, but not in the mutant. This evidence suggests a novel role for jasmonates in the light response of growth, and we discuss a cross-talk between jasmonate and auxin signaling. In addition, hebiba represents the first rice mutant in which the induction of the jasmonate pathway is impaired providing a valuable tool to study the role of jasmonates in Graminean development.
12569412	Cloning and characterization of a jasmonic acid-responsive gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase in suspension-cultured rice cells.	2003	Planta	In suspension-cultured rice ( Oryza sativaL.) cells, jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a signal transducer in elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose-induced phytoalexin production. Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with JA (10(-4) M) for 2 h yielded a cDNA for a gene that responded to exogenous JA by an increase in mRNA level. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the cDNA encodes an homologue of the yeast Old Yellow Enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to the sequences of 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductases (OPR) 1 and 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana(AtOPR1 and AtOPR2) and OPR1 from tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum) (LeOPR1). The cDNA-encoded protein purified from recombinant Escherichia coli cells as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein exhibited OPR activity similar to that of AtOPR1, AtOPR2, and LeOPR1, which catalyze reduction of (-)- cis-12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) preferentially over (+)- cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Thus the rice enzyme was termed OsOPR1. The physiological roles of OsOPR1 are discussed. This is the first report of the cloning of an OPR gene from a monocot plant.
12723614	Purification and characterization of extracellular beta-galactosidase secreted by supension cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells.	2003	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	A beta-galactosidase was purified 1300-fold by lactosyl-Sepharose 4B and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatographies from the cultured medium of a rice-cell suspension. The purified enzyme appeared as 47 kD and 40 kD polypeptides on SDS-PAGE and had a specific activity of 65.1 units/mg. Optimum activity was observed at pH 3.5 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme released galactose from galactoxyloglucan and pectic galactans.
23797600	Identification of qRBS1, a QTL involved in resistance to bacterial seedling rot in rice.	2013	Theor Appl Genet	Bacterial seedling rot (BSR), a destructive disease of rice (Oryza sativa L.), is caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae. To identify QTLs for resistance to BSR, we conducted a QTL analysis using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from a cross between Nona Bokra (resistant) and Koshihikari (susceptible). Comparison of the levels of BSR in the CSSLs and their recurrent parent, Koshihikari, revealed that a region on chromosome 10 was associated with resistance. Further genetic analyses using an F5 population derived from a cross between a resistant CSSL and Koshihikari confirmed that a QTL for BSR resistance was located on the short arm of chromosome 10. The Nona Bokra allele was associated with resistance to BSR. Substitution mapping in the Koshihikari genetic background demonstrated that the QTL, here designated as qRBS1 (quantitative trait locus for RESISTANCE TO BACTERIAL SEEDLING ROT 1), was located in a 393-kb interval (based on the Nipponbare reference genome sequence) defined by simple sequence repeat markers RM24930 and RM24944.
23803744	Effect of overexpression of kinase- or RNase-deficient OsIRE1 on the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in transgenic rice plants.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	IRE1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor protein in eukaryotes. In this study, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing three types of OsIRE1, including wild-type OsIRE1 (IRE1-OE) and two disrupted-IRE1s deficient in either kinase activity (K519A-OE) or RNase activity (K833A-OE), under the control of a constitutive promoter. Overexpression of wild-type IRE1 induced the ER stress response in transgenic rice even under non-stress conditions, whereas K519A-OE and K833A-OE had dominant negative effects on endogenous OsIRE1 expression in these transgenic plants. These lines exhibited phenotypes that were quite similar to those of OsIRE1 knock-down rice. These observations suggest that the two types of functionally disrupted OsIRE1 proteins behave as competitive inhibitors toward the ER stress response in transgenic rice plants. Furthermore, OsIRE1 may have a vital, as yet unidentified function, as determined through the characterization of the transgenic plants generated in this study.
23831949	Impacts of acute ozone stress on superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in rice leaves.	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Tropospheric ozone is an air pollutant harmful to plants and animals. Its rapid increase at the ground surface has raised serious concern over damage to the quality and yield of agricultural crops. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in plant cells when that are exposed to a high concentration of ozone, and the ROS are thought to alter gene expression and result in cellular death. Clarification of the ROS formation will provide us with a better understanding of the physiological responses to and signaling pathways of ozone stress in plants. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the ROS formation in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the premier crop in Asia. To determine ROS distribution in rice leaves under acute ozone stress, we analyzed superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression, lipid peroxidation, NADPH oxidase activity, and in vivo H2O2 formation. Interestingly, chloroplastic, peroxisomal and mitochondrial SODs down-regulated their expression levels under ozone stress, whereas cytosolic SODs maintained their expression level. Higher lipid peroxidation occurred after the end of ozone exposure, which suggests lipid peroxidation may not be due to ozone directly, but rather to metabolic changes caused by the ozone exposure. Activity of NADPH oxidase did not show significant change. The in vivo analysis indicated accelerated formation of H2O2 about 24 h after the onset of exposure, which suggests that cellular death occurred around this time.
23763241	MucoRice-cholera toxin B-subunit, a rice-based oral cholera vaccine, down-regulates the expression of α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor-like protein family as major rice allergens.	2013	J Proteome Res	To develop a cold chain- and needle/syringe-free rice-based cholera vaccine (MucoRice-CTB) for human use, we previously advanced the MucoRice system by introducing antisense genes specific for endogenous rice storage proteins and produced a molecularly uniform, human-applicable, high-yield MucoRice-CTB devoid of plant-associated sugar. To maintain the cold chain-free property of this vaccine for clinical application, we wanted to use a polished rice powder preparation of MucoRice-CTB without further purification but wondered whether this might cause an unexpected increase in rice allergen protein expression levels in MucoRice-CTB and prompt safety concerns. Therefore, we used two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis and shotgun MS/MS proteomics to compare rice allergen protein expression levels in MucoRice-CTB and wild-type (WT) rice. Both proteomics analyses showed that the only notable change in the expression levels of rice allergen protein in MucoRice-CTB, compared with those in WT rice, was a decrease in the expression levels of α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor-like protein family such as the seed allergen protein RAG2. Real-time PCR analysis showed mRNA of RAG2 reduced in MucoRice-CTB seed. These results demonstrate that no known rice allergens appear to be up-reregulated by genetic modification of MucoRice-CTB, suggesting that MucoRice-CTB has potential as a safe oral cholera vaccine for clinical application.
23790109	MutMap-Gap: whole-genome resequencing of mutant F2 progeny bulk combined with de novo assembly of gap regions identifies the rice blast resistance gene Pii.	2013	New Phytol	Next-generation sequencing allows the identification of mutations responsible for mutant phenotypes by whole-genome resequencing and alignment to a reference genome. However, when the resequenced cultivar/line displays significant structural variation from the reference genome, mutations in the genome regions missing from the reference (gaps) cannot be identified by simple alignment. Here we report on a method called 'MutMap-Gap', which involves delineating a candidate region harboring a mutation of interest using the recently reported MutMap method, followed by de novo assembly, alignment, and identification of the mutation within genome gaps. We applied MutMap-Gap to isolate the blast resistant gene Pii from the rice cv Hitomebore using mutant lines that have lost Pii function. MutMap-Gap should prove useful for cloning genes that exhibit significant structural variations such as disease resistance genes of the nucleotide-binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class.
23789941	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response.	2013	Plant J	The alteration of photoperiod sensitivity has let breeders diversify flowering time in Oryza sativa (rice) and develop cultivars adjusted to a range of growing season periods. Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase-I protein. One non-synonymous substitution in Hd16 resulted in decreased photoperiod sensitivity in rice, and this substitution occurred naturally in an old rice cultivar. By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2). In a near-isogenic line with the weak-photoperiod-sensitivity allele of Hd16, transcription levels of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 increased under long-day conditions, and transcription levels of Hd3a and RFT1 decreased under short-day conditions. Expression analysis under continuous light and dark conditions showed that Hd16 was not likely to be associated with circadian clock regulation. Biochemical characterization indicated that the functional Hd16 recombinant protein specifically phosphorylated Ghd7. These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7.
23832214	Expression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of rice L-galactose dehydrogenase.	2013	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	In plants, L-galactose dehydrogenase (L-GalDH) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA), which is well known as a unique antioxidant compound and a cofactor for many enzymes. L-GalDH catalyses the oxidation of L-galactose to L-galactono-1,4-lactone. Rice L-GalDH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Diffraction-quality rod-shaped crystals were grown using a sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. The L-GalDH crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P21 and diffracted to a resolution of 1.2 Å. The crystals had unit-cell parameters a = 46.8, b = 54.9, c = 56.9 Å, β = 102.3°. On the basis of the Matthews coefficient (VM = 2.1 Å(3) Da(-1), solvent content of 42.3%), it was estimated that one peptide was present in the asymmetric unit.
23889289	Jasmonate induction of the monoterpene linalool confers resistance to rice bacterial blight and its biosynthesis is regulated by JAZ protein in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in the regulation of host immunity in plants. Recently, we demonstrated that JA signalling has an important role in resistance to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Here, we report that many volatile compounds accumulate in response to exogenous application of JA, including the monoterpene linalool. Expression of linalool synthase was up-regulated by JA. Vapour treatment with linalool induced resistance to Xoo, and transgenic rice plants overexpressing linalool synthase were more resistance to Xoo, presumably due to the up-regulation of defence-related genes in the absence of any treatment. JA-induced accumulation of linalool was regulated by OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein involving the JA signalling pathway at the transcriptional level, suggesting that linalool plays an important role in JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice.
23874658	MutMap+: genetic mapping and mutant identification without crossing in rice.	2013	PLoS One	Advances in genome sequencing technologies have enabled researchers and breeders to rapidly associate phenotypic variation to genome sequence differences. We recently took advantage of next-generation sequencing technology to develop MutMap, a method that allows rapid identification of causal nucleotide changes of rice mutants by whole genome resequencing of pooled DNA of mutant F2 progeny derived from crosses made between candidate mutants and the parental line. Here we describe MutMap+, a versatile extension of MutMap, that identifies causal mutations by comparing SNP frequencies of bulked DNA of mutant and wild-type progeny of M3 generation derived from selfing of an M2 heterozygous individual. Notably, MutMap+ does not necessitate artificial crossing between mutants and the wild-type parental line. This method is therefore suitable for identifying mutations that cause early development lethality, sterility, or generally hamper crossing. Furthermore, MutMap+ is potentially useful for gene isolation in crops that are recalcitrant to artificial crosses.
23673217	Brassinolide-2,3-acetonide: a brassinolide-induced rice lamina joint inclination antagonist.	2013	Bioorg Med Chem	A novel chemical tool compound that is an antagonist of brassinolide (BL, 1)-induced rice lamina joint inclination was developed. Although 2-O-, 3-O-, 22-O-, or 23-O-methylation of BL causes a critical decrease in biological activity,(5) a crystal structure of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE I (BRI1) bound to BL(3,4) indicates that the loss of activity of the O-methylated BL may result from not only the low affinity to BRI1, but also from blocking the interaction with another BR signaling factor, a partner protein of BRI1 (e.g., BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1, BAK1). On the basis of this hypothesis we synthesized the BL 2,3-acetonide 2, the 22,23-acetonide 3, and the 2,3:22,23-diacetonide 4 to assess the possibility of 2-O- and 3-O- or/and 22-O- and 23-O-alkylated BL as an antagonist in BR signaling evoked by exogenously applied BL. The 2,3-acetonide 2 more strongly inhibited the lamina inclination caused by BL relative to the 22,23-acetonide 3, whereas the diacetonide 4 had no effect most likely due to its increased hydrophobicity. This suggested that the 2,3-hydroxyl groups of BL play a more significant role in the interaction with a BRI1 partner protein rather than BRI1 itself in rice lamina joint inclination. Taken together it was demonstrated that BL, the most potent agonist of BRI1, is transformed into an antagonist by functionalization of the 2,3-dihydroxyl groups as the acetonide. This finding opens the door to the potential development of a chemical tool that modulates protein-protein interactions in the BR signaling pathway to dissect the BR-dependent processes.
23987813	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	2013	Plant Sci	Low temperature tolerance during vegetative growth is an important objective in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs. We isolated a novel reduced culm number mutant, designated reduced culm number11 (rcn11), by screening under low-temperature condition in a paddy fields. Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/OsABCG5-associated vegetative growth control. The rcn11 mutant has no mutation in the RCN1/OsABCG5 gene and rcn11 has no effect on RCN1/OsABCG5 gene expression. In the rcn1 mutant, RCN1/OsABCG5 was upregulated showing that RCN1/OsABCG5 is controlled by negative feedback regulation. Absence of an effect of rcn11 on RCN1/OsABCG5 feedback regulation supported that RCN11 is not involved in the RCN1/OsABCG5-associated transport system. A genetic allelism test and molecular mapping study showed that rcn11 is independent of rcn1 on rice chromosome 3 and located on chromosome 8. The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/OsABCG5. A root development comparison between rcn1 and rcn11 in young seedlings represented that rcn11 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas rcn1 reduced lateral root density and elongation. Thus, rcn11 will shed new light on vegetative growth control under low temperature.
23212304	N-glycosylation and N-glycan moieties of CTB expressed in rice seeds.	2013	Mol Biotechnol	Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is widely used as a carrier molecule and mucosal adjuvant and for the expression of fusion proteins of interest. CTB-fusion proteins are also expressed in plants, but the N-glycan structures of CTB have not been clarified. To gain insights into the N-glycosylation and N-glycans of CTB expressed in plants, we expressed CTB in rice seeds with an N-terminal glutelin signal and a C-terminal KDEL sequence and analyzed its N-glycosylation and N-glycan structures. CTB was successfully expressed in rice seeds in two forms: a form with N-glycosylation at Asn32 that included both plant-specific N-glycans and small oligomannosidic N-glycans and a non-N-glycosylated form. N-Glycan analysis of CTB showed that approximately 50 % of the N-glycans had plant-specific M3FX structures and that almost none of the N-glycans was of high-mannose-type N-glycan even though the CTB expressed in rice seeds contains a C-terminal KDEL sequence. These results suggest that the CTB expressed in rice was N-glycosylated through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi N-glycosylation machinery without the ER retrieval.
23989667	RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 binding to bHLH and JAZ factors mediates control of cell wall plasticity in the root apex.	2013	Plant Signal Behav	Plasticity of root growth in response to environmental cues and stresses is a fundamental characteristic of plants, in accordance with their sessile lifestyle. This is linked to the balance between plasticity and rigidity of cells in the root apex, and thus is coordinated with the control of cell wall properties. However, mechanisms underlying such harmonization are not well understood, in particular under stressful conditions. We have recently demonstrated that RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 (RSS3), a nuclear factor that mediates restrictive expression of jasmonate-induced genes, plays an important role in root elongation under saline conditions. In this study, we report that loss-of-function of RSS3 results in changes in cell wall properties such as lignin deposition and sensitivity to a cellulose synthase inhibitor, concomitant with altered expression of genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Based on these and previous phenotypic observations of the rss3 mutant, we propose that RSS3 plays a role in the coordinated control of root elongation and cell wall plasticity in the root apex.
23910376	Assimilate translocation and expression of sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, contribute to high-performance ripening under heat stress in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar Genkitsukushi.	2013	J Plant Physiol	High temperature reduces the grain quality of rice, a situation likely to become more frequent because of global warming. We studied the effects of high-temperature stress on grain quality of heat-tolerant cultivar 'Genkitsukushi' and heat-sensitive cultivar 'Tsukushiroman'. When day/night temperatures were 31/26 °C from heading until maturity, the grain quality of 'Genkitsukushi' was rated at the first inspection grade (high quality), whereas 'Tsukushiroman' showed a remarkable increase in the percentage of white immature kernels (low quality). Nonstructural carbohydrate content in the stem of 'Genkitsukushi' the early maturation was significantly higher than in 'Tsukushiroman' and greatly decreased under high temperature. From 14 to 21 days after heading, the expression of the sucrose transporter gene, OsSUT1, was higher in the stem of 'Genkitsukushi' grown under high temperature than in 'Tsukushiroman'. In addition, the expression of OsSUT1 in the grains of 'Genkitsukushi' was significantly higher than in 'Tsukushiroman' during the ripening period. These results indicate that sugar transport functions more effectively in 'Genkitsukushi' than in 'Tsukushiroman', and that the effectiveness of sugar transport contributes to maintaining high grain quality in 'Genkitsukushi' under high-temperature conditions.
21635897	Three-dimensional analysis of the association of viral particles with mitochondria during the replication of Rice gall dwarf virus.	2011	J Mol Biol	Examination of cultured insect vector cells that had been infected with Rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV), using transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, revealed the presence of clusters of virus-coated mitochondria around viroplasms in which replication and assembly of RGDV occurred, suggesting a role for mitochondria in supplying the energy required for viral morphogenetic processes. Electron tomography revealed that RGDV particles on the surface of mitochondria are arrayed in an orderly but loose manner, unlike tightly packaged particles in vesicular compartments, suggesting the presence of counterpart molecules on the surface of mitochondria. The viral particles in close proximity to mitochondria were aligned along intermediate filaments, which might serve as scaffolds for the anchorage of these particles. RGDV has a putative mitochondrion-targeting sequence on the outer surface of the outer-capsid protein P8. The arrangement of RGDV particles around mitochondria suggests that the region of the P8 protein containing the mitochondrion-targeting sequence might attach to a molecule like a receptor on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Our analysis demonstrates the three-dimensional arrangement and molecular basis for the mitochondrial proximity of RGDV particles during viral replication.
21171893	Identification and characterization of 2'-deoxyuridine from the supernatant of conidial suspensions of rice blast fungus as an infection-promoting factor in rice plants.	2011	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	We previously detected infection-promoting activity in the supernatant of the conidial suspension (SCS) of the rice blast fungus. In the present study, a molecule carrying the activity was purified and identified as 2'-deoxyuridine (dU). The infection-promoting activity of dU was strictly dependent on its chemical structure and displayed characteristics consistent with those of the SCS. Notably, the activity of dU was exclusively detected during interactions between rice and virulent isolates of the fungus, the number of susceptible lesions in leaf blades was increased by dU, and nonhost resistance in rice plants was not affected by treatment with dU. In addition, the expression of pathogensis-related genes, accumulation of H(2)O(2), and production of phytoalexins in rice in response to inoculation with virulent fungal isolates was not suppressed by dU. The infection-promoting activity of dU was not accompanied by elevated levels of endogenous abscissic acid, which is known to modify plant-pathogen interactions, and was not detected in interactions between oat plants and a virulent oat blast fungus isolate. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dU is a novel infection-promoting factor that acts specifically during compatible interactions between rice plants and rice blast fungus in a mode distinct from that of toxins and suppressors.
21248479	Further characterization of an aluminum influx transporter in rice.	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized aluminum transporter recently identified in rice, which is a member of Nramp family. Here, we further characterized this transporter in terms of transport substrate specificity. Heterologous assay in yeast showed that Al transport activity by Nrat1 was unaffected by the presence of high concentration of Ca, but significantly inhibited by trivalent ions including Yb and Ga, analogs of Al. Knockout of Nrat1 did not affect the uptake of Cd and Mn in rice. On the other hand, over-expression of Nrat1 led to enhanced Al uptake by rice roots compared with wild-type rice, but did not affect Cd uptake. These results provide further evidence that unlike other Nramp members, Nrat1 is an influx transporter for trivalent Al ion.
21255809	Proteomic analysis of secreted proteins from aseptically grown rice.	2011	Phytochemistry	Plants are known to secrete a variety of compounds into the rhizosphere. These compounds are thought to play important roles in the regulation of soil chemical properties and soil microorganisms. To determine the composition of proteins secreted from rice roots, aseptic hydro culture was performed, and the collected proteins were analyzed. Over 100 proteins were identified; most were identified using the rice database (RAP-DB), and about 60% of the identified proteins were suspected to have a signal peptide. Functional categorization suggested that most were secondary metabolism- and defense-related proteins. Pathogenesis- and stress-related proteins were the major proteins found in the bathing solution under aseptic conditions. Thus, we propose that rice plants constitutively secrete a large variety of proteins to protect their roots against abiotic and/or biotic stresses in the environment.
21392842	Barnyard grass-induced rice allelopathy and momilactone B.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Here, we investigated chemical-mediated interaction between crop and weeds. Allelopathic activity of rice seedlings exhibited 5.3-6.3-fold increases when rice and barnyard grass seedlings were grown together, where there may be the competitive interference between rice and barnyard grass for nutrients. Barnyard grass is one of the most noxious weeds in rice cultivation. The momilactone B concentration in rice seedlings incubated with barnyard grass seedlings was 6.9-fold greater than that in rice seedlings incubated independently. Low nutrient growth conditions also increased allelopathic activity and momilactone B concentrations in rice seedlings. However, the increases in the low nutrient-induced allelopathic activity and momilactone B concentration were much lower than those in barnyard grass-induced allelopathic activity and momilactone B concentration. Root exudates of barnyard grass seedlings increased allelopathic activity and momilactone B concentration in rice seedlings at concentrations greater than 30 mg/L of the root exudates, and increasing the exudate concentration increased the activity and momilactone B concentration. Therefore, barnyard grass-induced allelopathic activity of rice seedlings may be caused not only by nutrient competition between two species, but also by components in barnyard grass root exudates. As momilactone B shows strong allelopathic activities, barnyard grass-induced allelopathic activity of rice may be due to the increased concentration of momilactone B in rice seedlings. The present research suggests that rice may respond to the presence of neighboring barnyard grass by sensing the components in barnyard grass root exudates and increasing allelopathic activity by production of elevated concentration of momilactone B. Thus, rice allelopathy may be one of the inducible defense mechanisms by chemical-mediated plant interaction between rice and barnyard grass, and the induced-allelopathy may provide a competitive advantage for rice through suppression of the growth of barnyard grass.
23466256	Genes offering the potential for designing yield-related traits in rice.	2013	Curr Opin Plant Biol	Breeding of high-yielding rice is crucial for meeting the food demand of the increasing world population. New technologies have facilitated identification of genes involved in quantitative traits, and many genes underpinning quantitative trait loci involved in rice crop yield have been isolated. Meanwhile, various kinds of mutants have been intensively studied, leading to characterization of many genes related to yield traits. A combination of quantitative trait locus analysis and studies of such mutants has made it possible to compile a list of genes available for breeding rice with higher yield.
24345551	Tillering and panicle branching genes in rice.	2014	Gene	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important staple food crops in the world, and rice tillering and panicle branching are important traits determining grain yield. Since the gene MONOCULM 1 (MOC 1) was first characterized as a key regulator in controlling rice tillering and branching, great progress has been achieved in identifying important genes associated with grain yield, elucidating the genetic basis of yield-related traits. Some of these important genes were shown to be applicable for molecular breeding of high-yielding rice. This review focuses on recent advances, with emphasis on rice tillering and panicle branching genes, and their regulatory networks.
21317545	The SMALL AND ROUND SEED1 (SRS1/DEP2) gene is involved in the regulation of seed size in rice.	2010	Genes Genet Syst	The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant 1 (srs1) was identified in rice by map-based cloning and named SMALL AND ROUND SEED 1 (SRS1). The SRS1 gene is identical to the previously identified DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2). The SRS1/DEP2 gene encodes a novel protein of 1365 amino acids residues without known functional domains. In the longitudinal direction of the lemma, both cell length and cell number are reduced in srs1-1 compared to the wild type, whereas in the lateral cross section of the lemma, cell length in srs1-1 is greater than that in the wild type, but the cell number in srs1-1 is the same as that in wild type. These results suggest that the small and round seed phenotype of srs1-1 is due to the reduction in both cell length and cell number in the longitudinal direction, and the elongation of the cells in the lateral direction of the lemma. The SRS1 mRNA and proteins are abundant in wild type rice specifically in young organs, namely young leaves, internodes and panicles. Interestingly, the tissues expressing SRS1 are closely related to the tissues that exhibit abnormalities in the srs1 mutants.
20502443	Rice DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 is essential for determining panicle outgrowth and elongation.	2010	Cell Res	The architecture of the panicle, including grain size and panicle morphology, directly determines grain yield. Panicle erectness, which is selected for achieving ideal plant architecture in the northern part of China, has drawn increasing attention of rice breeders. Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified. DEP2 encodes a plant-specific protein without any known functional domain. Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles. Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia. Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle. Despite a more compact plant type in the dep2 mutant, no significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and dep2 mutant. Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding.
20547591	FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Recent studies of highly branched mutants of pea, Arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that strigolactones (SLs) act as hormones that inhibit shoot branching. The identification of genes that work downstream of SLs is required for a better understanding of how SLs control the growth of axillary buds. We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (fc1) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog. Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on fc1 mutants, implying that proper FC1 functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth. Overexpression of FC1 partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height. An in situ hybridization analysis showed that FC1 mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots. FC1 mRNA expression was not significantly affected by GR24, suggesting that transcriptional induction may not be the mechanism by which SLs affect FC1 functioning. On the other hand, the expression level of FC1 is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment. We propose that FC1 acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice.
18690207	Inhibition of shoot branching by new terpenoid plant hormones.	2008	Nature	Shoot branching is a major determinant of plant architecture and is highly regulated by endogenous and environmental cues. Two classes of hormones, auxin and cytokinin, have long been known to have an important involvement in controlling shoot branching. Previous studies using a series of mutants with enhanced shoot branching suggested the existence of a third class of hormone(s) that is derived from carotenoids, but its chemical identity has been unknown. Here we show that levels of strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, are significantly reduced in some of the branching mutants. Furthermore, application of strigolactones inhibits shoot branching in these mutants. Strigolactones were previously found in root exudates acting as communication chemicals with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, we propose that strigolactones act as a new hormone class-or their biosynthetic precursors-in regulating above-ground plant architecture, and also have a function in underground communication with other neighbouring organisms.
20587735	A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length.	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (srs3) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene. The SRS3 gene was grouped as a member of the kinesin 13 subfamily. The SRS3 gene codes for a protein of 819 amino acids that contains a kinesin motor domain and a coiled-coil structure. Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type. The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type. The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction. The SRS3 protein, which is found in the crude microsomal fraction, is highly expressed in developing organs.
24764504	Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice.	2012	Rice (N Y)	Seed size is an important trait in determinant of rice seed quality and yield. In this study, we report a novel semi-dominant mutant Small and round seed 5 (Srs5) that encodes alpha-tubulin protein. Lemma cell length was reduced in Srs5 compared with that of the wild-type. Mutants defective in the G-protein alpha subunit (d1-1) and brassinosteroid receptor, BRI1 (d61-2) also exhibited short seed phenotypes, the former due to impaired cell numbers and the latter due to impaired cell length. Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2. Furthermore, SRS5 and BRI1 genes were highly expressed in Srs5 and d61-2 mutants. These data indicate that SRS5 independently regulates cell elongation of the brassinosteroid signal transduction pathway.
24097262	Identification and characterization of NF-Y transcription factor families in Canola (Brassica napus L.).	2014	Planta	NF-Y (NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y), a heterotrimeric transcription factor, is composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC proteins in yeast, animal, and plant systems. In plants, each of the NF-YA/B/C subunit forms a multi-member family. NF-Ys are key regulators with important roles in many physiological processes, such as drought tolerance, flowering time, and seed development. In this study, we identified, annotated, and further characterized 14 NF-YA, 14 NF-YB, and 5 NF-YC proteins in Brassica napus (canola). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the NF-YA/B/C subunits were more closely clustered with the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) homologs than with rice OsHAP2/3/5 subunits. Analyses of the conserved domain indicated that the BnNF-YA/B/C subfamilies, respectively, shared the same conserved domains with those in other organisms, including Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis, and Oryza sativa (rice). An examination of exon/intron structures revealed that most gene structures of BnNF-Y were similar to their homologs in Arabidopsis, a model dicot plant, but different from those in the model monocot plant rice, suggesting that plant NF-Ys diverged before monocot and dicot plants differentiated. Spatial-tempo expression patterns, as determined by qRT-PCR, showed that most BnNF-Ys were widely expressed in different tissues throughout the canola life cycle and that several closely related BnNF-Y subunits had similar expression profiles. Based on these findings, we predict that BnNF-Y proteins have functions that are conserved in the homologous proteins in other plants. This study provides the first extensive evaluation of the BnNF-Y family, and provides a useful foundation for dissecting the functions of BnNF-Y.
23832302	Expression of the rice microRNA miR820 is associated with epigenetic modifications at its own locus.	2013	Genes Genet Syst	Small RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate gene expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in eukaryotes. miRNAs are processed from duplexes formed on single-stranded RNA. They regulate expression of their target gene either by cleaving mRNA or supressing translation. In general, the primary miRNA transcripts are synthesized by RNA polymerase II and processed similarly to mRNAs. MIRNA genes are usually located in transcriptionally active euchromatic regions. In contrast, siRNAs are processed from duplexes made of two RNA molecules. One of them is often derived from a transposable element (TE) or from repetitive sequences that reside in heterochromatic regions. The other strand is synthesized by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on the first strand as a template. siRNAs establish epigenetic marks in parasitic DNA such as TEs, thus they usually act in cis. The rice miRNA miR820, encoded by CACTA TEs (five copies, located on different chromosomes), reduces the expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase gene OsDRM2. Because miR820 is derived from silent TEs, in which the heterochromatic histone modifications are enriched, the mechanism of MIR820 transcription could be expected to differ from typical miRNAs. Here we show that the primary transcript of MIR820 is mainly derived from the CACTA TE copy on chromosome 7 (MIR820b). Histone modification and DNA methylation status around MIR820b differed from that of the other four loci. These unique epigenetic modifications in MIR820b were only found around the miR820 coding region. We conclude that MIR820b transcription may depend on the unique epigenetic modifications, which in turn may be established by the action of miR820 in cis. This suggests a dual function of miR820 in cis and in trans.
24336215	D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling.	2013	Nature	Strigolactones (SLs), a newly discovered class of carotenoid-derived phytohormones, are essential for developmental processes that shape plant architecture and interactions with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms of SL remain poorly understood. Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation. We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment. The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the α/β hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception. We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone-induced degradation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses.
23706075	Identification of quantitative trait loci for cadmium accumulation and distribution in rice (Oryza sativa).	2013	Genome	Cadmium (Cd) poses a serious risk to human health due to its biological concentration through the food chain. To date, information on genetic and molecular mechanisms of Cd accumulation and distribution in rice remains to be elucidated. We developed an independent F7 RIL population derived from a cross between two japonica cultivars with contrasting Cd levels, 'Suwon490' and 'SNU-SG1', for QTLs identification of Cd accumulation and distribution. 'Suwon490' accumulated five times higher Cd in grain than 'SNU-SG1'. Large genotypic variations in Cd accumulation (17-fold) and concentration (12-fold) in grain were found among RILs. Significant positive correlations between Cd accumulation in grain with shoot Cd accumulation and shoot to grain distribution ratio of Cd signify that both shoot Cd accumulation and shoot to grain Cd distribution regulate Cd accumulation in japonica rice grain. A total of five main effect QTLs (scc10 for shoot Cd accumulation; gcc3, gcc9, gcc11 for grain Cd accumulation; and sgr5 for shoot to grain distribution ratio) were detected in chromosomes 10, 3, 9, 11, and 5, respectively. Of these, the novel potential QTL sgr5 has the strongest effect on shoot to grain Cd distribution. In addition, two digenic epistatic interaction QTLs were identified, suggesting the substantial contribution of nonallelic genes in genetic control of these Cd-related traits.
24280537	YGL138(t), encoding a putative signal recognition particle 54 kDa protein, is involved in chloroplast development of rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Normal development of chloroplast is vitally important to plants, but its biological mechanism is still far from fully being understood, especially in rice.

RESULTS: In this study, a novel yellow-green leaf mutant, ygl138, derived from Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) treated by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), was isolated. The mutant exhibited a distinct yellow-green leaf phenotype throughout development, reduced chlorophyll level, and arrested chloroplast development. The phenotype of the ygl138 mutant was caused by a single nuclear gene, which was tentatively designed as YGL138(t). The YGL138(t) locus was mapped to chromosome 11 and isolated into a confined region of 91.8 kb by map-based cloning. Sequencing analysis revealed that, Os11g05552, which was predicted to encode a signal recognition particle 54 kDa (SRP54) protein and act as a chloroplast precursor, had 18 bp nucleotides deletion in the coding region of ygl138 and led to a frameshift. Furthermore, the identity of Os11g05552 was verified by transgenic complementation.

CONCLUSIONS: These results are very valuable for further study on YGL138(t) gene and illuminating the mechanism of SRP54 protein involving in chloroplast development of rice.
24295067	Involvement of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6 in UV induced transcripts accumulation of genes in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: Ultra violet radiation leads to accumulation of phytoalexins (PA) in rice (Oryza sativa) which are typically accumulated when the plants are infected with rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Although extensive works have been done in elucidating phytoalexin biosynthesis, UV stress signal transduction leading to accumulations of rice phytoalexin is largely unknown.

RESULTS: In the present study, the involvement of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade has been shown in UV induced regulation of genes in phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice. UV induced activation of MAPK and expression of PA biosynthesis genes were shown to be inhibited with staurosporin and MAPK inhibitors. Transcript regulation studies and kinase assays indicated involvement of OsMKK6 in the process. Transgenic rice overexpressing constitutive active OsMKK6EE exhibited higher expression of genes of PA biosynthesis pathway upon UV stress and also upon infection with M. oryzae.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest a key role of OsMKK6 in regulation of UV responsive expression of genes of PA biosynthesis in rice. This study will help to elucidate the intricate signalling components of UV leading to phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice.
24016103	Identification of rice proteins recognized by the IgE antibodies of patients with food allergies.	2013	J Agric Food Chem	Similarity among food allergens is a great problem affecting the specificity of diagnosis and treatment of allergic patients. We have observed that 80% of patients with food (including wheat) and pollen allergies have increased IgE antibodies against rice proteins. By immunoblotting, we documented that boiling decreased solubility and IgE reactivity of PBS-extracted rice and wheat proteins, yet in SDS extracts this reactivity was only slightly changed. The sera of patients highly positive on the IgE immunoblot and positive in basophil activation and skin prick test with boiled rice components were used for characterizing the IgE-binding proteins separated by 1D or 2D electrophoresis. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 22 rice SDS soluble proteins. Six of them were new thermostable potential rice allergens: glutelin C precursor, granule-bound starch synthase 1 protein, disulfide isomerase-like 1-1 protein, hypothetical protein OsI_13867, putative acid phosphatase precursor 1, and a protein encoded by locus Os02g0453600. All of the identified rice proteins differed from known wheat allergens, except proteins belonging to the α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family. Furthermore, we would suggest that in patients with high IgE reactivity to wheat and rice components, the IgE immunoblot and skin prick test with boiled rice proteins could be beneficial before diet recommendation.
23199687	OsRab11 and OsGAP1 are essential for the vesicle trafficking of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase OsVHA-a1 under high salinity conditions.	2013	Plant Sci	To understand the molecular mechanism of the plant vacuolar H(+)-ATPase in endocytic trafficking and adaptation to high salinity, yeast two-hybrid assay, IP-western hybridization, trafficking assay, RT- and qRT-PCR analyses and growth assay were performed here. To confirm the interaction between OsVHA-a1 and OsGAP1, pull-down assay and Co-IP were performed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcription of OsVHA-a1, OsGAP1 and OsRab11 was induced under high salinity. Through the protoplast-based trafficking assay, OsVHA-a1 localized predominantly from the TGN to the PVC under stressed conditions. In addition, both OsGAP1 (R385A) and OsRab11 (S28N) mutants did not interact with OsVHA-a1, and blocked the vesicular trafficking of OsVHA-a1 to the PVC. In a seedling growth assay using the dominant negative OsRab11 (S28N), this mutant was much more sensitive to high salinity than the wild-type. Furthermore, the trafficking assay using isolated vacuoles demonstrated directly that OsGAP1 targeted to the tonoplast of the central vacuole under high salinity. Taken together, it is suggested that OsGAP1 and OsRab11 are essential for the vesicle trafficking of OsVHA-a1 to the PVC and/or the central vacuole under high salinity.

21781332	A survey of green plant tRNA 3'-end processing enzyme tRNase Zs, homologs of the candidate prostate cancer susceptibility protein ELAC2.	2011	BMC Evol Biol	BACKGROUND: tRNase Z removes the 3'-trailer sequences from precursor tRNAs, which is an essential step preceding the addition of the CCA sequence. tRNase Z exists in the short (tRNase ZS) and long (tRNase ZL) forms. Based on the sequence characteristics, they can be divided into two major types: bacterial-type tRNase ZS and eukaryotic-type tRNase ZL, and one minor type, Thermotoga maritima (TM)-type tRNase ZS. The number of tRNase Zs is highly variable, with the largest number being identified experimentally in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It is unknown whether multiple tRNase Zs found in A. thaliana is common to the plant kingdom. Also unknown is the extent of sequence and structural conservation among tRNase Zs from the plant kingdom.

RESULTS: We report the identification and analysis of candidate tRNase Zs in 27 fully sequenced genomes of green plants, the great majority of which are flowering plants. It appears that green plants contain multiple distinct tRNase Zs predicted to reside in different subcellular compartments. Furthermore, while the bacterial-type tRNase ZSs are present only in basal land plants and green algae, the TM-type tRNase ZSs are widespread in green plants. The protein sequences of the TM-type tRNase ZSs identified in green plants are similar to those of the bacterial-type tRNase ZSs but have distinct features, including the TM-type flexible arm, the variant catalytic HEAT and HST motifs, and a lack of the PxKxRN motif involved in CCA anti-determination (inhibition of tRNase Z activity by CCA), which prevents tRNase Z cleavage of mature tRNAs. Examination of flowering plant chloroplast tRNA genes reveals that many of these genes encode partial CCA sequences. Based on our results and previous studies, we predict that the plant TM-type tRNase ZSs may not recognize the CCA sequence as an anti-determinant.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings substantially expand the current repertoire of the TM-type tRNase ZSs and hint at the possibility that these proteins may have been selected for their ability to process chloroplast pre-tRNAs with whole or partial CCA sequences. Our results also support the coevolution of tRNase Zs and tRNA 3'-trailer sequences in plants.
23698632	The rice RING finger E3 ligase, OsHCI1, drives nuclear export of multiple substrate proteins and its heterogeneous overexpression enhances acquired thermotolerance.	2013	J Exp Bot	Thermotolerance is very important for plant survival when plants are subjected to lethally high temperature. However, thus far little is known about the functions of RING E3 ligase in response to heat shock in plants. This study found that one rice gene encoding the RING finger protein was specifically induced by heat and cold stress treatments but not by salinity or dehydration and named it OsHCI1 (Oryza sativa heat and cold induced 1). Subcellular localization results showed that OsHCI1 was mainly associated with the Golgi apparatus and moved rapidly and extensively along the cytoskeleton. In contrast, OsHCI1 may have accumulated in the nucleus under high temperatures. OsHCI1 physically interacted with nuclear substrate proteins including a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Transient co-overexpression of OsHCI1 and each of three nuclear proteins showed that their fluorescent signals moved into the cytoplasm as punctuate formations. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsHCI1 in Arabidopsis highly increased survival rate through acquired thermotolerance. It is proposed that OsHCI1 mediates nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of nuclear substrate proteins via monoubiquitination and drives an inactivation device for the nuclear proteins under heat shock.
24333854	Computational identification of microRNAs in the strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) genome sequence and validation of their precise sequences by miR-RACE.	2014	Gene	In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation and have been found to control many genes involved in different biological and metabolic processes. Extensive studies were carried out to discover miRNAs and analyze their functions in model plant species, such as in Arabidopsis and rice that have been reported. In this research, we used bioinformatics to predict microRNAs in an important strawberry rootstock cultivar to discover and validate precise sequences of microRNAs in strawberry. By adopting a range of filtering criteria, we obtained 59 potential miRNAs belonging to 40 miRNA families from the Fragaria vesca genome. Using two specific 5' and 3' miRNA RACE PCR reactions and a sequence-directed cloning method, we accurately determined 34 precise sequences of candidate miRNAs, while six other sequences exhibited some minor divergence in their termini nucleotides, and 19 miRNAs that could not be cloned owing to expression abundance may be too low or these mirRNAs predicted could not be existing in strawberry. Potential target genes were further predicted for the miRNAs above. The expression of the 16 miRNAs unreported and having exact sequences and their targets by experiment could be detected in different tissues of strawberry ranging from roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits by qRT-PCR and some of them showed differential expression in various tissues. The functional analysis of 16 miRNAs and their targets was carried out. Finally, we conclude that there are 34 mirRNAs in strawberry and their targets play vital roles not only in growth and development, but also in diverse physiological processes. These results show that regulatory miRNAs exist in agronomically important strawberry and might have an important function in strawberry growth and development.
24297875	NAL1 allele from a rice landrace greatly increases yield in modern indica cultivars.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Increasing crop production is essential for securing the future food supply in developing countries in Asia and Africa as economies and populations grow. However, although the Green Revolution led to increased grain production in the 1960s, no major advances have been made in increasing yield potential in rice since then. In this study, we identified a gene, SPIKELET NUMBER (SPIKE), from a tropical japonica rice landrace that enhances the grain productivity of indica cultivars through pleiotropic effects on plant architecture. Map-based cloning revealed that SPIKE was identical to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), which has been reported to control vein pattern in leaf. Phenotypic analyses of a near-isogenic line of a popular indica cultivar, IR64, and overexpressor lines revealed increases in spikelet number, leaf size, root system, and the number of vascular bundles, indicating the enhancement of source size and translocation capacity as well as sink size. The near-isogenic line achieved 13-36% yield increase without any negative effect on grain appearance. Expression analysis revealed that the gene was expressed in all cell types: panicles, leaves, roots, and culms supporting the pleiotropic effects on plant architecture. Furthermore, SPIKE increased grain yield by 18% in the recently released indica cultivar IRRI146, and increased spikelet number in the genetic background of other popular indica cultivars. The use of SPIKE in rice breeding could contribute to food security in indica-growing regions such as South and Southeast Asia.
24433207	Genetic diversity of the rice bean (Vigna umbellata) genepool as assessed by SSR markers.	2013	Genome	The genetic diversity of 472 rice bean accessions (388 cultivated and 84 wild) from 16 Asian countries was evaluated by 13 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In total, 168 alleles were detected, and the numbers of alleles in cultivated and wild accessions were 129 and 132, respectively. The gene diversity in cultivated populations (0.565) was about 83% of that for wild (0.678) populations. Cultivated populations from Vietnam, Myanmar, Nepal, and India had the highest gene diversity (>0.5). East Asian accessions formed a distinct genepool. Indonesian cultivated accessions showed high genetic divergence from other cultivated populations and had the most similar genetic structure to wild accessions. In Nepalese cultivated accessions, many accessions from western regions were quite distinct from others and formed a specific group. These Nepalese accessions could be considered a unique gene source for rice bean breeding. In contrast, eastern Nepalese accessions showed an SSR profile similar to that of Southeast Asian rice beans. The present study represents the first comprehensive SSR analysis in cultivated and wild rice bean germplasm and clarifies geographical distribution of genetic profile that might be used to broaden the genetic base of currently grown rice bean cultivars.

24365594	DNA methylation changes in photoperiod-thermo-sensitive male sterile rice PA64S under two different conditions.	2014	Gene	Epigenetic modification can occur at a high frequency in crop plants and might generate phenotypic variation without changes in DNA sequences. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that may contribute to environmentally-induced phenotypic variations by regulating gene expression. Rice Photoperiod-Thermo-Sensitive Genic Male Sterile (PTGMS) lines can transform from sterility to fertility under lower temperatures and short-day (SD) conditions during anther development. So far, little is known about the DNA methylation variation of PTGMS throughout the genome in rice. In this study, we investigated DNA cytosine methylation alterations in the young panicles of PTGMS line PA64S under two different conditions using methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) method. Compared with the DNA methylation level of PA64S under lower temperatures and SD conditions (fertility), higher methylation was observed in PA64S (sterility). The sequences of 25 differentially amplified fragments were successfully obtained and annotated. Three methylated fragments, which are homologous to D2, NAD7 and psaA, were confirmed by bisulfite sequencing and their expression levels were also evaluated by qPCR. Real time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that five of the six selected methylated genes were downregulated in PA64S (sterility). These results suggested that DNA methylation may be involved in the sterility-fertility transition of PA64S under two different environmental conditions.

24344283	Constraints and potentials of future irrigation water availability on agricultural production under climate change.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	We compare ensembles of water supply and demand projections from 10 global hydrological models and six global gridded crop models. These are produced as part of the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project, with coordination from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project, and driven by outputs of general circulation models run under representative concentration pathway 8.5 as part of the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Models project that direct climate impacts to maize, soybean, wheat, and rice involve losses of 400-1,400 Pcal (8-24% of present-day total) when CO2 fertilization effects are accounted for or 1,400-2,600 Pcal (24-43%) otherwise. Freshwater limitations in some irrigated regions (western United States; China; and West, South, and Central Asia) could necessitate the reversion of 20-60 Mha of cropland from irrigated to rainfed management by end-of-century, and a further loss of 600-2,900 Pcal of food production. In other regions (northern/eastern United States, parts of South America, much of Europe, and South East Asia) surplus water supply could in principle support a net increase in irrigation, although substantial investments in irrigation infrastructure would be required.
24564211	DNA is structured as a linear "jigsaw puzzle" in the genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, and budding yeast.	2014	Genome	Knowledge of how a genome is structured and organized from its constituent elements is crucial to understanding its biology and evolution. Here, we report the genome structuring and organization pattern as revealed by systems analysis of the sequences of three model species, Arabidopsis, rice and yeast, at the whole-genome and chromosome levels. We found that all fundamental function elements (FFE) constituting the genomes, including genes (GEN), DNA transposable elements (DTE), retrotransposable elements (RTE), simple sequence repeats (SSR), and (or) low complexity repeats (LCR), are structured in a nonrandom and correlative manner, thus leading to a hypothesis that the DNA of the species is structured as a linear "jigsaw puzzle". Furthermore, we showed that different FFE differ in their importance in the formation and evolution of the DNA jigsaw puzzle structure between species. DTE and RTE play more important roles than GEN, LCR, and SSR in Arabidopsis, whereas GEN and RTE play more important roles than LCR, SSR, and DTE in rice. The genes having multiple recognized functions play more important roles than those having single functions. These results provide useful knowledge necessary for better understanding genome biology and evolution of the species and for effective molecular breeding of rice.
24321689	Characterization of the Distal-less gene homologue, NlDll, in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).	2014	Gene	The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is a globally devastating insect pest of rice, particularly in eastern Asia. Distal-less or Dll is a highly conserved and well studied transcription factor required for limb formation in invertebrates and vertebrates. We have identified a homologue of this gene, NlDll, and demonstrated that it is expressed in all life stages of N. lugens, particularly in adult brachypterous females. When we compared between specific adult tissues it was expressed most strongly in wings. Using RNAi techniques we demonstrated that downregulation of NlDll in the 3rd instar larvae led to the disrupted development of the leg, while downregulation of NlDll in the 5th instar larvae led to abnormal wing formation. Ectopic over-expression of NlDll in Drosophila melanogaster using the GAL4-UAS system led to fatal or visible phenotypic changes such as the loss of normal wing structure and disrupted haltere structure. Our work suggests that NlDll is a conserved homologue of Distal-less and is required for both leg development and wing structure. Since researches have shown that Dll is required for wing morphogenesis, understanding the role of NlDll during the wing development will further provide a basis for revealing the molecular mechanism of the wing dimorphism in brown planthopper. In the future, NlDll could be used as a target gene for brown planthopper pest management in the field.
24363334	Function of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases in rice.	2014	Ann Bot	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although xyloglucans are ubiquitous in land plants, they are less abundant in Poales species than in eudicotyledons. Poales cell walls contain higher levels of β-1,3/1,4 mixed-linked glucans and arabinoxylans than xyloglucans. Despite the relatively low level of xyloglucans in Poales, the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene family in rice (Oryza sativa) is comparable in size to that of the eudicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana. This raises the question of whether xyloglucan is a substrate for rice XTH gene products, whose enzyme activity remains largely uncharacterized.

METHODS: This study focused on OsXTH19 (which belongs to Group IIIA of the XTH family and is specifically expressed in growing tissues of rice shoots), and two other XTHs, OsXTH11 (Group I/II) and OsXTH20 (Group IIIA), for reference, and measurements were made of the enzymatic activities of three recombinant rice XTHs, i.e. OsXTH11, OsXTH20 and OsXTH19.

KEY RESULTS: All three OsXTH gene products have xyloglucan endohydrolase (XEH, EC 3·2·1·151) activity, and OsXTH11 has both XEH and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET, EC 2·4·1207) activities. However, these proteins had neither hydrolase nor transglucosylase activity when glucuronoarabinoxylan or mixed-linkage glucan was used as the substrate. These results are consistent with histological observations demonstrating that pOsXTH19::GUS is expressed specifically in the vicinity of tissues where xyloglucan immunoreactivity is present. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing OsXTH19 (harbouring a Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter::OsXTH19 cDNA construct) or with suppressed OsXTH19 expression (harbouring a pOsXTH19 RNAi construct) did not show dramatic phenotypic changes, suggesting functional redundancy and collaboration among XTH family members, as was observed in A. thaliana.

CONCLUSIONS: OsXTH20 and OsXTH19 act as hydrolases exclusively on xyloglucan, while OsXTH11 exhibits both hydrolase and XET activities exclusively on xyloglucans. Phenotypic analysis of transgenic lines with altered expression of OsXTH19 suggests that OsXTH19 and related XTH(s) play redundant roles in rice growth.
24361504	Transcriptional regulation of host NH₄⁺ transporters and GS/GOGAT pathway in arbuscular mycorrhizal rice roots.	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in the nutrition of many land plants. AM roots have two pathways for nutrient uptake, directly through the root epidermis and root hairs and via AM fungal hyphae into root cortical cells, where arbuscules or hyphal coils provide symbiotic interfaces. Recent studies demonstrated that the AM symbiosis modifies the expression of plant transporter genes and that NH₄⁺ is the main form of N transported in the symbiosis. The aim of the present work was to get insights into the mycorrhizal N uptake pathway in Oryza sativa by analysing the expression of genes encoding ammonium transporters (AMTs), glutamine synthase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) in roots colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and grown under two N regimes. We found that the AM symbiosis down-regulated OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;3 expression at low-N, but not at high-N conditions, and induced, independently of the N status of the plant, a strong up-regulation of OsAMT3;1 expression. The AM-inducible NH₄⁺ transporter OsAMT3;1 belongs to the family 2 of plant AMTs and is phylogenetically related to the AM-inducible AMTs of other plant species. Moreover, for the first time we provide evidence of the specific induction of a GOGAT gene upon colonization with an AM fungus. These data suggest that OsAMT3;1 is likely involved in the mycorrhizal N uptake pathway in rice roots and that OsGOGAT2 plays a role in the assimilation of the NH₄⁺ supplied via the OsAMT3;1 AM-inducible transporter.
24459431	Expression and promoter analysis of six heat stress-inducible genes in rice.	2013	ScientificWorldJournal	During the long evolutionary process, plant gradually formed a series of strategies and mechanisms to cope with stress environment such as drought, heat, cold, and high salinity. Six highly heat responsive genes were identified in rice by microarray data analysis. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of these six genes were highly heat inducible and moderately responded to salt stress, polyethylene glycol, and abscisic acid treatment, but little affected by cold treatment. Promoters of the three highly heat-inducible genes (OsHsfB2cp, PM19p, and Hsp90p) were used to drive GUS gene expression in rice. The results of the GUS gene expression, histochemical staining, and GUS activities in panicles and flag leaves of the transgenic rice plants confirmed high heat-induced GUS activities and moderate drought-induced activities. The three promoters exhibited similar high activity lever in rice leaf under heat, but OsHsfB2cp and PM19p showed much higher activities in panicles under heat stress. Our work confirmed that the OsHsfB2c and PM19 promoters were highly heat inducible and further characterization and reconstruction of cis-elements in their promoters could lead to the development of highly effective heat-inducible promoters for plant genetic engineering.
24371168	Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase.	2013	J Genet	Flavin monooxygenases (FMO) play a key role in tryptophan (Trp)-dependent indole-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis in plants and regulate plant growth and development. In this study, the full-length genomic DNA and cDNA of OsFMO(t), a FMO gene that was originally identified from a rolled-leaf mutant in rice, was isolated and cloned from wild type of the rolled-leaf mutant. OsFMO(t) was found to have four exons and three introns, and encode a protein with 422 amino acid residues that contains two basic conserved motifs, with a 'GxGxxG' characteristic structure. OsFMO(t) showed high amino acid sequence identity with FMO proteins from other plants, in particular with YUCCA from Arabidopsis, FLOOZY from Petunia, and OsYUCCA1 from rice. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that OsFMO(t) and the homologous FMO proteins belong to the same clade in the evolutionary tree. Overexpression of OsFMO(t) in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid (NAA) were added to the medium. These results suggested that the OsFMO(t) protein is involved in IAA biosynthesis in rice and its overexpression could lead to the malformation of calli. Spatio-temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR and histochemical analysis for GUS activity revealed that expression of OsFMO(t) was totally absent in the rolled-leaf mutant. However, in the wild type variety, this gene was expressed at different levels temporally and spatially, with the highest expression observed in tissues with fast growth and cell division such as shoot apexes, tender leaves and root tips. Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by OsFMO(t) is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice.
24312593	Down-regulation of OsSPX1 causes high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings.	2013	PLoS One	Rice SPX domain gene, OsSPX1, plays an important role in the phosphate (Pi) signaling network. Our previous work showed that constitutive overexpression of OsSPX1 in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants improved cold tolerance while also decreasing total leaf Pi. In the present study, we generated rice antisense and sense transgenic lines of OsSPX1 and found that down-regulation of OsSPX1 caused high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings. Compared to wild-type and OsSPX1-sense transgenic lines, more hydrogen peroxide accumulated in seedling leaves of OsSPX1-antisense transgenic lines for controls, cold and methyl viologen (MV) treatments. Glutathione as a ROS scavenger could protect the antisense transgenic lines from cold and MV stress. Rice whole genome GeneChip analysis showed that some oxidative-stress marker genes (e.g. glutathione S-transferase and P450s) and Pi-signaling pathway related genes (e.g. OsPHO2) were significantly down-regulated by the antisense of OsSPX1. The microarray results were validated by real-time RT-PCR. Our study indicated that OsSPX1 may be involved in cross-talks between oxidative stress, cold stress and phosphate homeostasis in rice seedling leaves.
24365575	Molecular characterization of cyclophilin A-like protein from Piriformospora indica for its potential role to abiotic stress tolerance in E. coli.	2013	BMC Res Notes	BACKGROUND: Cyclophilins (CyP), conserved in all genera, are known to have regulatory responses of various cellular processes including stress tolerance. Interestingly, CyP has a crucial role as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases). Our earlier in silico based approach resulted into the identification of cyclophilin family from rice, Arabidopsis and yeast. In our recent report, we discovered a new OsCYP-25 from rice. Here, we identified a novel cyclophylin A-like protein (PiCyP) from Piriformospora indica which is responsible for abiotic stress tolerance in E. coli.

RESULTS: Cyclophylin A-like protein (CyPA) (accession number GQ214003) was selected from cDNA library. The genomic organization CyPA revealed a 1304 bp of CyPA in P. indica genome, showing 10 exons and 9 introns. Further, CyPA was evident in PCR with gDNA and cDNA and Southern blot analysis. The phylogenetic examination of CyPA of P. indica showed that it is closed to human cyclophilin. The uniqueness of PiCyPA protein was apparent in western blot study. Kinetics of purified PiCyPA protein for its PPIas activity was determined via first order rate constant (0.104 s-1) in the presence of 1 μg of PiCyPA, with increasing PiCyPA concentration, in the presence of cyclosporin A (CsA) and the inhibition constant (4.435 nM) of CsA for inhibition of PiCyPA. The differential response of E. coli harbouring pET28a-PiCypA was observed for their different degree of tolerance to different abiotic stresses as compared to empty pET28a vector.

CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of PiCyPA protein E. coli cells confer enhanced tolerance to wide range of abiotic stresses. Thus, this study provides the significance of PiCypA as a molecular chaperone which advanced cellular stress responses of E. coli cells under adverse conditions, and it, furthermore, confirms the mounting the sustainability of E. coli for exploitation in recombinant proteins production. Additionally, the PiCyPA gene cooperates substantial functions in cellular network of stress tolerance mechanism, essentially required for various developmental stages, and might be a potential paramount candidate for crop improvement and its sustainable production under adverse conditions.
24534105	OsAlba1, a dehydration-responsive nuclear protein of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica), participates in stress adaptation.	2014	Phytochemistry	Alba proteins have exhibited great functional plasticity through the course of evolution and constitute a superfamily that spans across three domains of life. Earlier, we had developed the dehydration-responsive nuclear proteome of an indica rice cultivar, screening of which led to the identification of an Alba protein. Here we describe, for the first time, the complete sequence of the candidate gene OsAlba1, its genomic organization, and possible function/s in plant. Phylogenetic analysis showed its close proximity to other monocots as compared to dicot Alba proteins. Protein-DNA interaction prediction indicates a DNA-binding property for OsAlba1. Confocal microscopy showed the localization of OsAlba1-GFP fusion protein to the nucleus, and also sparsely to the cytoplasm. Water-deficit conditions triggered OsAlba1 expression suggesting its function in dehydration stress, possibly through an ABA-dependent pathway. Functional complementation of the yeast mutant ΔPop6 established that OsAlba1 also functions in oxidative stress tolerance. The preferential expression of OsAlba1 in the flag leaves implies its role in grain filling. Our findings suggest that the Alba components such as OsAlba1, especially from a plant where there is no evidence for a major chromosomal role, might play important function in stress adaptation.
24474801	Lateral organ boundaries 1 is a disease susceptibility gene for citrus bacterial canker disease.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Citrus bacterial canker (CBC) disease occurs worldwide and incurs considerable costs both from control measures and yield losses. Bacteria that cause CBC require one of six known type III transcription activator-like (TAL) effector genes for the characteristic pustule formation at the site of infection. Here, we show that Xanthomonas citri subspecies citri strain Xcc306, with the type III TAL effector gene pthA4 or with the distinct yet biologically equivalent gene pthAw from strain XccA(w), induces two host genes, CsLOB1 and CsSWEET1, in a TAL effector-dependent manner. CsLOB1 is a member of the Lateral Organ Boundaries (LOB) gene family of transcription factors, and CsSWEET1 is a homolog of the SWEET sugar transporter and rice disease susceptibility gene. Both TAL effectors drive expression of CsLOB1 and CsSWEET1 promoter reporter gene fusions when coexpressed in citrus or Nicotiana benthamiana. Artificially designed TAL effectors directed to sequences in the CsLOB1 promoter region, but not the CsSWEET1 promoter, promoted pustule formation and higher bacterial leaf populations. Three additional distinct TAL effector genes, pthA*, pthB, and pthC, also direct pustule formation and expression of CsLOB1. Unlike pthA4 and pthAw, pthB and pthC do not promote the expression of CsSWEET1. CsLOB1 expression was associated with the expression of genes associated with cell expansion. The results indicate that CBC-inciting species of Xanthomonas exploit a single host disease susceptibility gene by altering the expression of an otherwise developmentally regulated gene using any one of a diverse set of TAL effector genes in the pathogen populations.
24702065	Characterization of cysteine protease-like genes in the striped rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.	2014	Genome	The striped rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker), is a major pest for rice production in China and the rest of Southeast Asia. Chemical control is the main means to alleviate losses due to this pest, which causes serious environmental pollution. An effective and environmentally friendly approach is needed for the management of the striped rice stem borer. Cysteine proteases in insects could be useful targets for pest management either through engineering plant protease inhibitors, targeting insect digestive cysteine proteases, or through RNA interference-based silencing of cysteine proteases, disrupting developmental regulation of insects. In this study, eight cysteine protease-like genes were identified and partially characterized. The genes CCO2 and CCL4 were exclusively expressed in the larval gut, and their expression was affected by the state of nutrition in the insect. The expression of CCL2, CCL3, and CCO1 was significantly affected by the type of host plant, suggesting a role in host plant - insect interactions. Our initial characterization of the striped rice stem borer cysteine protease-like genes provides a foundation for further research on this important group of genes in this major insect pest of rice.
24393458	A novel carotenoid, 4-keto-α-carotene, as an unexpected by-product during genetic engineering of carotenogenesis in rice callus.	2014	Phytochemistry	Rice endosperm is devoid of carotenoids because the initial biosynthetic steps are absent. The early carotenogenesis reactions were constituted through co-transformation of endosperm-derived rice callus with phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase transgenes. Subsequent steps in the pathway such as cyclization and hydroxylation reactions were catalyzed by endogenous rice enzymes in the endosperm. The carotenoid pathway was extended further by including a bacterial ketolase gene able to form astaxanthin, a high value carotenoid which is not a typical plant carotenoid. In addition to astaxanthin and precursors, a carotenoid accumulated in the transgenic callus which did not fit into the pathway to astaxanthin. This was subsequently identified as 4-keto-α-carotene by HPLC co-chromatography, chemical modification, mass spectrometry and the reconstruction of its biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli. We postulate that this keto carotenoid is formed from α-carotene which accumulates by combined reactions of the heterologous gene products and endogenous rice endosperm cyclization reactions.
24583583	Efficient imputation of missing markers in low-coverage genotyping-by-sequencing data from multiparental crosses.	2014	Genetics	We consider genomic imputation for low-coverage genotyping-by-sequencing data with high levels of missing data. We compensate for this loss of information by utilizing family relationships in multiparental experimental crosses. This nearly quadruples the number of usable markers when applied to a large rice Multiparent Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) study.
24563202	The synaptonemal complex protein ZYP1 is required for imposition of meiotic crossovers in barley.	2014	Plant Cell	In many cereal crops, meiotic crossovers predominantly occur toward the ends of chromosomes and 30 to 50% of genes rarely recombine. This limits the exploitation of genetic variation by plant breeding. Previous reports demonstrate that chiasma frequency can be manipulated in plants by depletion of the synaptonemal complex protein ZIPPER1 (ZYP1) but conflict as to the direction of change, with fewer chiasmata reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and more crossovers reported for rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we use RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the amount of ZYP1 in barley (Hordeum vulgare) to only 2 to 17% of normal zygotene levels. In the ZYP1(RNAi) lines, fewer than half of the chromosome pairs formed bivalents at metaphase and many univalents were observed, leading to chromosome nondisjunction and semisterility. The number of chiasmata per cell was reduced from 14 in control plants to three to four in the ZYP1-depleted lines, although the localization of residual chiasmata was not affected. DNA double-strand break formation appeared normal, but the recombination pathway was defective at later stages. A meiotic time course revealed a 12-h delay in prophase I progression to the first labeled tetrads. Barley ZYP1 appears to function similarly to ZIP1/ZYP1 in yeast and Arabidopsis, with an opposite effect on crossover number to ZEP1 in rice, another member of the Poaceae.
24583172	Construction and analysis of gonad suppression subtractive hybridization libraries for the rice field eel, Monopterus albus.	2014	Gene	The objective of this study was to investigate gene transcription profiles of the stage IV ovary and the ovotestis of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus) in an attempt to uncover genes involved in sex reversal and gonad development. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed using mRNA from the stage IV ovary and the ovotestis. In total 100 positive clones from the libraries were selected at random and sequenced, and then expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used to search against sequences in the GenBank database using the BLASTn and BLASTx search algorithms. High quality SSH cDNA libraries and 90 ESTs were obtained. Of these ESTs, 43 showed high homology with genes of known function and these are associated with energy metabolism, signal transduction, transcription regulation and so on. The remaining 47 ESTs shared no homology with any genes in GenBank and are thus considered to be hypothetical genes. Furthermore, the four genes F11, F63, R11, and R47 from the forward and reverse libraries were analyzed in gonad, brain, heart, spleen, liver, kidney and muscle tissues. The results showed that the transcription of the F11 and F63 genes was significantly increased while the expression of the R11 and R47 genes was significantly decreased from IV or V ovary. In addition, the results also indicated that the four genes' expression was not gonad-tissue specific. This results strongly suggested that they may be involved in the rice field eel gonad development and/or sex reversal.
24525402	Comparative genomic analysis of the Sm gene family in rice and maize.	2014	Gene	Sm proteins are a group of ubiquitous ring-shaped oligomers that function in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. However, until this study, no comprehensive study incorporating phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene organization, adaptive evolution, expression profiling and functional networks has been reported for rice and maize. In this study, twenty-five and thirty-three Sm genes have been identified in rice and maize, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses identified eighteen gene groups. Results by gene locations indicated that segmental duplication contributes to the expansion of this gene family in rice and maize. Gene organization and motif compositions of the Sm members are highly conserved in each group, indicative of their functional conservation. Expression profiles have provided insights into the possible functional divergence among members of the Sm gene family. Adaptive evolution analyses suggested that purifying selection was the main force driving Sm evolution, but some critical sites might be responsible for functional divergence. In addition, four hundred and seventy-nine interactions were identified by functional network analyses, and most of which were associated with binding, cellular macromolecule biosynthesis, pre-mRNA processing and transferase activity. Overall, the data contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of Sm gene family in rice and maize and will provide a solid foundation for future functional studies.
24642938	N-glycosylation of effector proteins by an α-1,3-mannosyltransferase is required for the rice blast fungus to evade host innate immunity.	2014	Plant Cell	Plant pathogenic fungi deploy secreted effectors to suppress plant immunity responses. These effectors operate either in the apoplast or within host cells, so they are putatively glycosylated, but the posttranslational regulation of their activities has not been explored. In this study, the ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION3 (ALG3)-mediated N-glycosylation of the effector, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), was found to be essential for its activity in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. ALG3 encodes an α-1,3-mannosyltransferase for protein N-glycosylation. Deletion of ALG3 resulted in the arrest of secondary infection hyphae and a significant reduction in virulence. We observed that Δalg3 mutants induced massive production of reactive oxygen species in host cells, in a similar manner to Δslp1 mutants, which is a key factor responsible for arresting infection hyphae of the mutants. Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to avoid their recognition by the rice (Oryza sativa) chitin elicitor binding protein CEBiP and the induction of innate immune responses, including reactive oxygen species production. We demonstrate that Slp1 has three N-glycosylation sites and that simultaneous Alg3-mediated N-glycosylation of each site is required to maintain protein stability and the chitin binding activity of Slp1, which are essential for its effector function. These results indicate that Alg3-mediated N-glycosylation of Slp1 is required to evade host innate immunity.
24670769	Methane fluxes show consistent temperature dependence across microbial to ecosystem scales.	2014	Nature	Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas because it has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) by mass over a century. Recent calculations suggest that atmospheric CH4 emissions have been responsible for approximately 20% of Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. Understanding how CH4 emissions from ecosystems will respond to expected increases in global temperature is therefore fundamental to predicting whether the carbon cycle will mitigate or accelerate climate change. Methanogenesis is the terminal step in the remineralization of organic matter and is carried out by strictly anaerobic Archaea. Like most other forms of metabolism, methanogenesis is temperature-dependent. However, it is not yet known how this physiological response combines with other biotic processes (for example, methanotrophy, substrate supply, microbial community composition) and abiotic processes (for example, water-table depth) to determine the temperature dependence of ecosystem-level CH4 emissions. It is also not known whether CH4 emissions at the ecosystem level have a fundamentally different temperature dependence than other key fluxes in the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. Here we use meta-analyses to show that seasonal variations in CH4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems exhibit an average temperature dependence similar to that of CH4 production derived from pure cultures of methanogens and anaerobic microbial communities. This average temperature dependence (0.96 electron volts (eV)), which corresponds to a 57-fold increase between 0 and 30°C, is considerably higher than previously observed for respiration (approximately 0.65 eV) and photosynthesis (approximately 0.3 eV). As a result, we show that both the emission of CH4 and the ratio of CH4 to CO2 emissions increase markedly with seasonal increases in temperature. Our findings suggest that global warming may have a large impact on the relative contributions of CO2 and CH4 to total greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial wetlands and rice paddies.

24631263	Identification of rice genes associated with cosmic-ray response via co-expression gene network analysis.	2014	Gene	In order to better understand the biological systems that are affected in response to cosmic ray (CR), we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis using the module detection method. By using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) value, we evaluated complex gene-gene functional interactions between 680 CR-responsive probes from integrated microarray data sets, which included large-scale transcriptional profiling of 1000 microarray samples. These probes were divided into 6 distinct modules that contained 20 enriched gene ontology (GO) functions, such as oxidoreductase activity, hydrolase activity, and response to stimulus and stress. In particular, modules 1 and 2 commonly showed enriched annotation categories such as oxidoreductase activity, including enriched cis-regulatory elements known as ROS-specific regulators. These results suggest that the ROS-mediated irradiation response pathway is affected by CR in modules 1 and 2. We found 243 ionizing radiation (IR)-responsive probes that exhibited similarities in expression patterns in various irradiation microarray data sets. The expression patterns of 6 randomly selected IR-responsive genes were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction following treatment with CR, gamma rays (GR), and ion beam (IB); similar patterns were observed among these genes under these 3 treatments. Moreover, we constructed subnetworks of IR-responsive genes and evaluated the expression levels of their neighboring genes following GR treatment; similar patterns were observed among them. These results of network-based analyses might provide a clue to understanding the complex biological system related to the CR response in plants.
24424778	Global genomic diversity of Oryza sativa varieties revealed by comparative physical mapping.	2014	Genetics	Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) physical maps embedding a large number of BAC end sequences (BESs) were generated for Oryza sativa ssp. indica varieties Minghui 63 (MH63) and Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and were compared with the genome sequences of O. sativa spp. japonica cv. Nipponbare and O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11. The comparisons exhibited substantial diversities in terms of large structural variations and small substitutions and indels. Genome-wide BAC-sized and contig-sized structural variations were detected, and the shared variations were analyzed. In the expansion regions of the Nipponbare reference sequence, in comparison to the MH63 and ZS97 physical maps, as well as to the previously constructed 93-11 physical map, the amounts and types of the repeat contents, and the outputs of gene ontology analysis, were significantly different from those of the whole genome. Using the physical maps of four wild Oryza species from OMAP (http://www.omap.org) as a control, we detected many conserved and divergent regions related to the evolution process of O. sativa. Between the BESs of MH63 and ZS97 and the two reference sequences, a total of 1532 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs), 71,383 SNPs, 1767 multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, 6340 insertions, and 9137 deletions were identified. This study provides independent whole-genome resources for intra- and intersubspecies comparisons and functional genomics studies in O. sativa. Both the comparative physical maps and the GBrowse, which integrated the QTL and molecular markers from GRAMENE (http://www.gramene.org) with our physical maps and analysis results, are open to the public through our Web site (http://gresource.hzau.edu.cn/resource/resource.html).
24657062	Map-based analysis of the tenacious glume gene Tg-B1 of wild emmer and its role in wheat domestication.	2014	Gene	The domestication of wheat was instrumental in spawning the civilization of humankind, and it occurred through genetic mutations that gave rise to types with non-fragile rachises, soft glumes, and free-threshing seed. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides), the tetraploid AB-genome progenitor of domesticated wheat has genes that confer tenacious glumes (Tg) that underwent genetic mutations to give rise to free-threshing wheat. Here, we evaluated disomic substitution lines involving chromosomes 2A and 2B of wild emmer accessions substituted for homologous chromosomes in tetraploid and hexaploid backgrounds. The results suggested that both chromosomes 2A and 2B of wild emmer possess genes that inhibit threshability. A population of recombinant inbred lines derived from the tetraploid durum wheat variety Langdon crossed with a Langdon - T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides accession PI 481521 chromosome 2B disomic substitution line was used to develop a genetic linkage map of 2B, evaluate the genetics of threshability, and map the gene derived from PI 481521 that inhibited threshability. A 2BS linkage map comprised of 58 markers was developed, and markers delineated the gene to a 2.3 cM interval. Comparative analysis with maps containing the tenacious glume gene Tg-D1 on chromosome arm 2 DS from Aegilops tauschii, the D genome progenitor of hexaploid wheat, revealed that the gene inhibiting threshability in wild emmer was homoeologous to Tg-D1 and therefore designated Tg-B1. Comparative analysis with rice and Brachypodium distachyon indicated a high level of divergence and poorly conserved colinearity, particularly near the Tg-B1 locus. These results provide a foundation for further studies involving Tg-B1, which, together with Tg-D1, had profound influences on wheat domestication.
24633159	Chalk5 encodes a vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase influencing grain chalkiness in rice.	2014	Nat Genet	Grain chalkiness is a highly undesirable quality trait in the marketing and consumption of rice grain. However, the molecular basis of this trait is poorly understood. Here we show that a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), Chalk5, influences grain chalkiness, which also affects head rice yield and many other quality traits. Chalk5 encodes a vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis and H(+)-translocation activity. Elevated expression of Chalk5 increases the chalkiness of the endosperm, putatively by disturbing the pH homeostasis of the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds, which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies and is coupled with a great increase in small vesicle-like structures, thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances and resulting in chalky grain. Our results indicate that two consensus nucleotide polymorphisms in the Chalk5 promoter in rice varieties might partly account for the differences in Chalk5 mRNA levels that contribute to natural variation in grain chalkiness.
24434551	Carlactone is an endogenous biosynthetic precursor for strigolactones.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of terpenoid plant hormones that regulate shoot branching as well as being known as root-derived signals for symbiosis and parasitism. SL has tricyclic-lactone (ABC-ring) and methyl butenolide (D-ring), and they are connected through an enol ether bridge. Recently, a putative biosynthetic intermediate called carlactone (CL), of which carbon skeleton is in part similar to those of SLs, was identified by biochemical analysis of three biosynthetic enzymes, DWARF27, CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (CCD7), and CCD8 in vitro. However, CL has never been identified from plant tissues, and the conversion of CL to SLs has not been proven in vivo. To address these questions, we chemically synthesized (13)C-labeled CL. We show that (13)C-labeled CL is converted to (-)-[(13)C]-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol ((-)-2'-epi-5DS) and [(13)C]-orobanchol, endogenous SLs in rice, in the dwarf10 mutant, which is defective in CCD8. In addition, we successfully identified endogenous CL by using liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry in rice and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we determined the absolute stereochemistry of endogenous CL to be (11R)-configuration, which is the same as that of (-)-2'-epi-5DS at the corresponding position. Feeding experiments showed that only the (11R)-isomer of CL, but not the (11S)-isomer, was converted to (-)-2'-epi-5DS in vivo. Taken together, our data provide conclusive evidence that CL is an endogenous SL precursor that is stereospecifically recognized in the biosynthesis pathway.
24482191	Expression and functional analysis of putative vacuolar Ca2+-transporters (CAXs and ACAs) in roots of salt tolerant and sensitive rice cultivars.	2014	Protoplasma	Vacuolar Ca2+-transporters could play an important role for salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) root. Here, we compared the expression profiles of putative vacuolar cation/H+ exchanger (CAX) and calmodulin-regulated autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) in rice roots of salt tolerant cv. Pokkali and salt sensitive cv. IR29. In addition to five putative vacuolar CAX genes in the rice genome, a new CAX gene (OsCAX4) has been annotated. In the present study, we isolated the OsCAX4 gene and showed that its encoded protein possesses a unique transmembrane structure and is potentially involved in transporting not only Ca2+ but also Mn2+ and Cu2+. These six OsCAX genes differed in their mRNA expression pattern in roots of tolerant versus sensitive rice cultivars exposed to salt stress. For example, OsCAX4 showed abundant expression in IR29 (sensitive) upon prolonged salt stress. The mRNA expression profile of four putative vacuolar Ca2+-ATPases (OsACA4-7) was also examined. Under control conditions, the mRNA levels of OsACA4, OsACA5, and OsACA7 were relatively high and similar among IR29 and Pokkali. Upon salt stress, only OsACA4 showed first a decrease in its expression in Pokkali (tolerant), followed by a significant increase. Based on these results, a role of vacuolar Ca2+ transporter for salt tolerance in rice root was discussed.
24563249	Overexpression of rice OsREX1-S, encoding a putative component of the core general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH, renders plant cells tolerant to cadmium- and UV-induced damage by enhancing DNA excision repair.	2014	Planta	Screening of 40,000 Arabidopsis FOX (Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressor gene hunting system) lines expressing rice full-length cDNAs brings us to identify four cadmium (Cd)-tolerant lines, one of which carried OsREX1-S as a transgene. OsREX1-S shows the highest levels of identity to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii REX1-S (referred to as CrREX1-S, in which REX denotes Required for Excision) and to yeast and human TFB5s (RNA polymerase II transcription factor B5), both of which are components of the general transcription and DNA repair factor, TFIIH. Transient expression of OsREX1-S consistently localized the protein to the nucleus of onion cells. The newly generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsREX1-S reproducibly displayed enhanced Cd tolerance, confirming that the Cd-tolerance of the initial identified line was conferred solely by OsREX1-S expression. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsREX1-S exhibited ultraviolet-B (UVB) tolerance by reducing the amounts of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers produced by UVB radiation. Moreover, those transgenic OsREX1-S Arabidopsis plants became resistant to bleomycin (an inducer of DNA strand break) and mitomycin C (DNA intercalating activity), compared to wild type. Our results indicate that OsREX1-S renders host plants tolerant to Cd, UVB radiation, bleomycin and mitomycin C through the enhanced DNA excision repair.
24482436	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors.	2014	Mol Plant	The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.
24634487	Evidence supporting distinct functions of three cytosolic glutamine synthetases and two NADH-glutamate synthases in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	The functions of the three isoenzymes of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1;1, GS1;2, and GS1;3) and two NADH-glutamate synthases (NADH-GOGAT1 and NADH-GOGAT2) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) were characterized using a reverse genetics approach and spatial expression of the corresponding genes. OsGS1;2 and OsNADH-GOGAT1 were mainly expressed in surface cells of rice roots in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner. Disruption of either gene by the insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 caused reduction in active tiller number and hence panicle number at harvest. Re-introduction of OsGS1;2 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the knockout mutants successfully restored panicle number to wild-type levels. These results indicate that GS1;2 and NADH-GOGAT1 are important in the primary assimilation of NH4 (+) taken up by rice roots. OsGS1;1 and OsNADH-GOGAT2 were mainly expressed in vascular tissues of mature leaf blades. OsGS1;1 mutants showed severe reduction in growth rate and grain filling, whereas OsNADH-GOGAT2 mutants had marked reduction in spikelet number per panicle. Complementation of phenotypes seen in the OsGS1;1 mutant was successfully observed when OsGS1;1 was re-introduced. Thus, these two enzymes could be important in remobilization of nitrogen during natural senescence. Metabolite profiling data showed a crucial role of GS1;1 in coordinating metabolic balance in rice. Expression of OsGS1:3 was spikelet-specific, indicating that it is probably important in grain ripening and/or germination. Thus, these isoenzymes seem to possess distinct and non-overlapping functions and none was able to compensate for the individual function of another.
24492654	Expression of OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 alters development, stress responses and pathogen susceptibility in Arabidopsis.	2014	Sci Rep	Multidrug and Toxic compound Extrusion proteins (MATE) are a group of secondary active transporters with ubiquitous occurrences in all domains of life. This is a newly characterized transporter family with limited functional knowledge in plants. In this study, we functionally characterised two members of rice MATE gene family, OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 through expression in heterologous system, Arabidopsis. Expression of OsMATEs in Arabidopsis altered growth and morphology of transgenic plants. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed modulation of genes involved in plant growth, development and biotic stress in transgenic lines. Transgenic plants displayed sensitivity for biotic and abiotic stresses. Elevated pathogen susceptibility of transgenic lines was correlated with reduced expressions of defence related genes. Promoter and cellular localization studies suggest that both MATEs express in developing and reproductive organs and are plasma-membrane localised. Our results reveal that OsMATE1 and OsMATE2 regulate plant growth and development as well as negatively affect disease resistance.
24617729	Rice OsPAD4 functions differently from Arabidopsis AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions.	2014	Plant J	The extensively studied Arabidopsis phytoalexin deficient 4 (AtPAD4) gene plays an important role in Arabidopsis disease resistance; however, the function of its sequence ortholog in rice is unknown. Here, we show that rice OsPAD4 appears not to be the functional ortholog of AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions, and that the OsPAD4 encodes a plasma membrane protein but that AtPAD4 encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. Suppression of OsPAD4 by RNA interference (RNAi) increased rice susceptibility to the biotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacteria blight disease in local tissue. OsPAD4-RNAi plants also show compromised wound-induced systemic resistance to Xoo. The increased susceptibility to Xoo was associated with reduced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and phytoalexin momilactone A (MOA). Exogenous application of JA complemented the phenotype of OsPAD4-RNAi plants in response to Xoo. The following results suggest that OsPAD4 functions differently than AtPAD4 in response to pathogen infection. First, OsPAD4 plays an important role in wound-induced systemic resistance, whereas AtPAD4 mediates systemic acquired resistance. Second, OsPAD4-involved defense signaling against Xoo is JA-dependent, but AtPAD4-involved defense signaling against biotrophic pathogens is salicylic acid-dependent. Finally, OsPAD4 is required for the accumulation of terpenoid-type phytoalexin MOA in rice-bacterium interactions, but AtPAD4-mediated resistance is associated with the accumulation of indole-type phytoalexin camalexin.
24577486	Exogenous Boron supplementation partially rescues fertilization defect of osbor4 mutant.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Arabidopsis thaliana BOR1 is the first boron (B) transporter identified in the living systems. In the rice genome, there are four AtBOR1-like genes, OsBOR1, 2, 3 and 4. We have previously demonstrated that OsBOR4 is a B efflux transporter gene specifically expressed in rice pollen. OsBOR4 heterozygous lines showed abnormal segregation ratio, suggesting the significance of OsBOR4 in rice pollen tube germination/elongation process. To obtain further insights into the mechanisms underlying fertilization defects by osbor4 mutations, we examined if the mutant pollen exhibits morphological changes. The cross section of the pollen of the mutant was similar to those of the wild type. We also determined B concentrations in brown rice of three osbor4 mutants and found that B levels were comparable. These results suggest that osbor4 mutation does not affect B transport to pollen and seeds. We then examined if exogenous B supplementation can rescue segregation defect of osbor4. As reported previously, a OsBOR4 heterozygous lines showed abnormal segregation rate under the normal growth condition in this present study, too. Importantly, this abnormality in segregation was partially rescued by application of six-times higher B concentration to roots, providing further evidence that the fertilization defect of osbor4 is due to the defect in B transport process. Taken together we propose that osbor4 causes defect in B transport process during pollen germination to fertilization.
24398379	OsSUV3 functions in cadmium and zinc stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv IR64).	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Protein of nuclear encoded SUV3 (suppressor of Var 3) gene is a DNA and RNA helicase, localized in mitochondria and is a subunit of the degradosome complex involved in regulation of RNA surveillance and turnover. To overcome the abiotic stress-induced loss of crop yield, a multi-stress tolerant trait is required. Beside salinity stress the heavy metals including cadmium and zinc also affect the yield and quality of food crops. Since rice is a one of the staple food therefore it is important to develop a multi-stress including salinity and metal tolerant variety. Recently we have reported the role of OsSUV3 in salinity stress tolerance in rice; however, its role in metal stress has not been studied so far. Here we report that in response to cadmium and zinc stress the OsSUV3 transcript level is induced in rice and its overexpression in transgenic IR64 rice plants confers the metal stress tolerance. In addition to its previously reported role in salinity stress tolerance, this study further shows the role of OsSUV3 helicase in cadmium and zinc stress tolerance suggesting its involvement in multi-stress tolerance.
24578505	Two rice authentic histidine phosphotransfer proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, mediate cytokinin signaling and stress responses in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Cytokinin plays an important role in plant development and stress tolerance. Studies of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have demonstrated that cytokinin acts through a two-component system that includes a histidine (His) kinase, a His phosphotransfer protein (HP), and a response regulator. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the conservation of His kinases but lineage-specific expansion of HPs and response regulators in rice (Oryza sativa). However, whether the functions of rice HPs have diverged remains unknown. In this study, two rice authentic HPs (OsAHP1 and OsAHP2) were knocked down simultaneously via RNA interference (RNAi), and the transgenic OsAHP-RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes expected for a deficiency in cytokinin signaling, including dwarfism with reduced internode lengths, enhanced lateral root growth, early leaf senescence, and reduced tiller numbers and fertility under natural conditions. The OsAHP-RNAi seedlings were also hyposensitive to exogenous cytokinin. Furthermore, OsAHP-RNAi seedlings were hypersensitive to salt treatment but resistant to osmotic stress relative to wild-type plants. These results indicate that OsAHPs function as positive regulators of the cytokinin signaling pathway and play different roles in salt and drought tolerance in rice.
24664473	Positive regulation of rice RING E3 ligase OsHIR1 in arsenic and cadmium uptakes.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	The metalloid arsenic (As) and the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) are ubiquitously found at low concentrations in the earth. High concentrations of these elements in the soil and crops are severely dangerous to human health. We attempted to retrieve the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase gene for regulating As and Cd uptakes via the ubiquitin 26S proteasome system. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted for a total of 47 Oryza sativa RING finger protein (OsRFP) genes to assess their expression patterns when exposed to As and Cd treatments. We identified one gene Oryza sativa heavy metal induced RING E3 ligase 1 (OsHIR1), which was significantly upregulated with both treatments. A yeast hybrid screen and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that OsHIR1 clearly interacts with 5 substrate proteins, including tonoplast intrinsic protein 4;1 (OsTIP4;1) in the plasma membrane. In addition, OsHIR1 strongly degraded the protein level of OsTIP4;1 via the ubiquitin 26S proteasome system. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsHIR1 in Arabidopsis exhibited As- and Cd-insensitive phenotypes and resulted in decreased As and Cd accumulation in the shoots and roots, relative to the control. Herein, we report the novel finding that the OsHIR1 E3 ligase positively regulates OsTIP4;1 related to As and Cd uptakes.
24564817	Genetic dissection of Al tolerance QTLs in the maize genome by high density SNP scan.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Aluminum (Al) toxicity is an important limitation to food security in tropical and subtropical regions. High Al saturation on acid soils limits root development, reducing water and nutrient uptake. In addition to naturally occurring acid soils, agricultural practices may decrease soil pH, leading to yield losses due to Al toxicity. Elucidating the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying maize Al tolerance is expected to accelerate the development of Al-tolerant cultivars.

RESULTS: Five genomic regions were significantly associated with Al tolerance, using 54,455 SNP markers in a recombinant inbred line population derived from Cateto Al237. Candidate genes co-localized with Al tolerance QTLs were further investigated. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) developed for ZmMATE2 were as Al-sensitive as the recurrent line, indicating that this candidate gene was not responsible for the Al tolerance QTL on chromosome 5, qALT5. However, ZmNrat1, a maize homolog to OsNrat1, which encodes an Al(3+) specific transporter previously implicated in rice Al tolerance, was mapped at ~40 Mbp from qALT5. We demonstrate for the first time that ZmNrat1 is preferentially expressed in maize root tips and is up-regulated by Al, similarly to OsNrat1 in rice, suggesting a role of this gene in maize Al tolerance. The strongest-effect QTL was mapped on chromosome 6 (qALT6), within a 0.5 Mbp region where three copies of the Al tolerance gene, ZmMATE1, were found in tandem configuration. qALT6 was shown to increase Al tolerance in maize; the qALT6-NILs carrying three copies of ZmMATE1 exhibited a two-fold increase in Al tolerance, and higher expression of ZmMATE1 compared to the Al sensitive recurrent parent. Interestingly, a new source of Al tolerance via ZmMATE1 was identified in a Brazilian elite line that showed high expression of ZmMATE1 but carries a single copy of ZmMATE1.

CONCLUSIONS: High ZmMATE1 expression, controlled either by three copies of the target gene or by an unknown molecular mechanism, is responsible for Al tolerance mediated by qALT6. As Al tolerant alleles at qALT6 are rare in maize, marker-assisted introgression of this QTL is an important strategy to improve maize adaptation to acid soils worldwide.
24442518	Evidences for structural basis of altered ascorbate peroxidase activity in cadmium-stressed rice plants exposed to jasmonate.	2014	Biometals	Binding interactions of cadmium (Cd) with rice ascorbate peroxidase (OsAPX) in presence or absence of jasmonate was examined in-silico. OsAPX is a 250 amino acid long protein with 90 % sequence similarity to soybean-APX. The 3D model of OsAPX obtained by homology modeling using soybean APX (PDBID:1OAF) as template was associated with -15975.85 kJ/mol energy, 100 % residues in favoured region, verify score of 0.85, ERRAT score 89.625 and a negative ProSA graph, suggesting OsAPX model to be of good quality, robust and reliable which was submitted with Protein Model Database with PMDBID: PM0078091. The rice ascorbate peroxidase ascorbate [OsAPX-Asc] complex had a substrate binding cavity involving residues at position (30)KSCAPL(35), (167)RCH(169) and (172)R wherein ascorbate accommodated via three H-bonds involving (30)Lys at the γ-edge of heme. (169)His served as a bridge between heme-porphyrin of OsAPX and ascorbate creating a charge relay system. Cd bound in [OsAPX-Asc-Cd] complex at (29)EKSCAPL(35), a site similar to ascorbate binding site. The binding of Cd caused breaking of (169)His bridge shifting the protein conformation. Cadmium exhibited four electrostatic interactions via (29)Glu of OsAPX backbone. Docking of [OsAPX-Asc] with jasmonic acid (JA) resulted in [OsAPX-Asc-JA] complex where 4-H-bonds held JA to OsAPX in a cavity at γ-edge on the distal side of heme. The binding of [OsAPX-Asc-JA] to Cd show the metal to bind at a position other than that involved in binding of OsAPX with Cd alone. Results indicate that Cd does not replace iron or ascorbate or JA but binds to OsAPX on the surface at a separate site electrostatically. In presence of JA the interactions involved in formation of [OsAPXAsc] are restored which is otherwise altered by the presence of Cd. The formation and reformation of H-bond take place between the [OsAPX-Asc] and Cd/JA. It is the interaction between heme and ascorbate which is modulated differently in presence of Cd/JA. In absence of JA, Cd-binds to the [OsAPX-Asc] complex at the proximal end of APX near Asc-binding site, whereas in presence of JA, Cd-binds on the opposite site of the Asc-binding site involving (30)Lys and (29)Glu residues. In-silico binding studies well correlate with the wet-lab results where exogenous application of JA increased the activity of OsAPX in rice grown under Cd-stress. Therefore it is concluded that the activity of OsAPX in rice roots and shoots are compromised under Cd-stress alone.
24506212	Functional analysis of chimeric lysin motif domain receptors mediating Nod factor-induced defense signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana and chitin-induced nodulation signaling in Lotus japonicus.	2014	Plant J	The expression of chimeric receptors in plants is a way to activate specific signaling pathways by corresponding signal molecules. Defense signaling induced by chitin from pathogens and nodulation signaling of legumes induced by rhizobial Nod factors (NFs) depend on receptors with extracellular lysin motif (LysM) domains. Here, we constructed chimeras by replacing the ectodomain of chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (AtCERK1) of Arabidopsis thaliana with ectodomains of NF receptors of Lotus japonicus (LjNFR1 and LjNFR5). The hybrid constructs, named LjNFR1-AtCERK1 and LjNFR5-AtCERK1, were expressed in cerk1-2, an A. thaliana CERK1 mutant lacking chitin-induced defense signaling. When treated with NFs from Rhizobium sp. NGR234, cerk1-2 expressing both chimeras accumulated reactive oxygen species, expressed chitin-responsive defense genes and showed increased resistance to Fusarium oxysporum. In contrast, expression of a single chimera showed no effects. Likewise, the ectodomains of LjNFR1 and LjNFR5 were replaced by those of OsCERK1 (Oryza sativa chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1) and OsCEBiP (O. sativa chitin elicitor-binding protein), respectively. The chimeras, named OsCERK1-LjNFR1 and OsCEBiP-LjNFR5, were expressed in L. japonicus NF receptor mutants (nfr1-1; nfr5-2) carrying a GUS (β-glucuronidase) gene under the control of the NIN (nodule inception) promoter. Upon chitin treatment, GUS activation reflecting nodulation signaling was observed in the roots of NF receptor mutants expressing both chimeras, whereas a single construct was not sufficient for activation. Hence, replacement of ectodomains in LysM domain receptors provides a way to specifically trigger NF-induced defense signaling in non-legumes and chitin-induced nodulation signaling in legumes.
24627964	Characterization of OsLCT1, a cadmium transporter from indica rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Physiol Plant	Molecular understanding of cadmium (Cd) transport in indica rice (Oryza sativa) is still insufficient, although indica rice generally has a potential to accumulate higher Cd in shoots and grains than japonica rice. We have previously demonstrated that OsLCT1 is a Cd transporter gene responsible for grain Cd accumulation in the japonica model cultivar Nipponbare. In this study, we isolated OsLCT1 cDNA from Kasalath, a model indica (aus subgroup) cultivar and conducted cation transport activity assays in yeast and mRNA expression analysis in plants. The deduced amino acid sequence of Kasalath OsLCT1 is 91.2% identical and 93.8% similar to that of Nipponbare OsLCT1. We established the yeast heterologous system expressing the Kasalath allele of OsLCT1. Elemental profiling of the yeast cells suggested an efflux activity of Kasalath OsLCT1 for Cd, K, Mg, Ca and Mn, but not for Fe, Zn, Cu and Na. This substrate specificity was identical to that of the Nipponbare version. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that expression of OsLCT1 in Kasalath was higher in reproductive stage than in vegetative stage. The expression level of OsLCT1 was significantly higher in Kasalath than in Nipponbare. Phylogenetic analysis found several LCT1-like genes only in grass plants. OsLCT1 is the sole copy in the rice genome and is conserved among each rice subgroup. These newly found low-affinity cation transporter (LCT) homologs will provide a basis for further understanding of LCT-mediated Cd transport.
24412327	OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, negatively regulates polar auxin transport and root development in rice.	2014	Biochim Biophys Acta	BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subfamily of putative RLKs in plants. Although several members in this subfamily have been identified, the studies about the relationships between LRR-RLKs and root development are still few. We previously identified a novel LRR-RLK in rice roots, and named it OsRPK1.

METHODS: In this study, we first detected OsRPK1 kinase activity in vitro, and assessed its expression profile. We then investigated its biological function using transgenic rice plants over- and under-expressing OsRPK1.

RESULTS: The OsRPK1 gene, which encodes a Ca(2+)-independent Ser/Thr kinase, was predominantly expressed in root tips, leaf blades, and undifferentiated suspension cells, and was markedly induced by treatment with auxin or ABA. Knockdown of OsRPK1 promoted the growth of transgenic rice plants, and increased plant height and tiller numbers. In contrast, over-expressing plants showed undeveloped adventitious roots, lateral roots, and a reduced root apical meristem. OsRPK1 over-expression also inhibited the expression of most auxin efflux carrier OsPIN genes, which was accompanied by changes in PAT and endogenous free IAA distribution in the leaves and roots.

CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that OsRPK1, a novel leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase, affects the root system architecture by negatively regulating polar auxin transport in rice.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated a common regulatory pathway of root system development in higher plants, which might be initiated by external stimuli via upstream receptor-like kinases and downstream carriers for polar auxin transport.
24619164	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of the novel thermo-sensitive genic male sterility tms9-1 gene in rice.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: Fine mapping of the novel thermo-sensitive genic male sterility locus tms9 - 1 in the traditional TGMS line HengnongS-1 revealed that the MALE STERILITY1 homolog OsMS1 is the candidate gene. Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (P/TGMS) has been widely used in the two-line hybrid rice breeding system. HengnongS-1 is one of the oldest TGMS lines and is often used in indica two-line breeding programs in China. In this study, our genetic analysis showed that the TGMS gene in HengnongS-1 was controlled by a single recessive gene that was non-allelic with the other TGMS loci identified, including C815S, Zhu1S and Y58S. Using SSR markers and bulked segregant analysis, we located the TGMS locus on chromosome 9 and named the gene tms9-1. Fine mapping further narrowed the tms9-1 loci to a 162 kb interval between two dCAPS markers. Sequence analysis revealed that a T to C substitution results in an amino acid change in the tms9-1 candidate gene (Os09g27620) in HengnongS-1 as compared to Minghui63. Sequencing of other rice accessions, including six P/TGMS lines, seven indica varieties and nine japonica varieties, showed that this SNP was exclusive to HengnongS-1. With multiple sequence alignment and expression pattern analyses, the rice MALE STERILITY1 homolog OsMS1 gene was identified as the candidate gene for tms9-1. Therefore, our study identified a novel TGMS locus and will facilitate the functional identification of the tms9-1 gene. Moreover, the markers linked to the tms9-1 gene will provide useful tools for the development of new TGMS lines by marker-assisted selection in two-line hybrid rice breeding programs.
24452439	Cloning of seed dormancy genes (TaSdr) associated with tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting in common wheat and development of a functional marker.	2014	Theor Appl Genet	KEY MESSAGE: After cloning and mapping of wheat TaSdr genes, both the functional markers for TaSdr - B1 and TaVp - 1B were validated, and the distribution of allelic variations at TaSdr - B1 locus in the wheat cultivars from 19 countries was characterized. Seed dormancy is a major factor associated with pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat TaSdr genes, orthologs of OsSdr4 conferring seed dormancy in rice, were cloned by a comparative genomics approach. They were located on homoeologous group 2 chromosomes, and designated as TaSdr-A1, TaSdr-B1 and TaSdr-D1, respectively. Sequence analysis of TaSdr-B1 revealed a SNP at the position -11 upstream of the initiation codon, with bases A and G in cultivars with low and high germination indices (GI), respectively. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence marker Sdr2B was developed based on the SNP, and subsequently functional analysis of TaSdr-B1 was conducted by association and linkage mapping. A QTL for GI co-segregating with Sdr2B explained 6.4, 7.8 and 8.7 % of the phenotypic variances in a RIL population derived from Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 grown in Shijiazhuang, Beijing and the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two sets of Chinese wheat cultivars were used for association mapping, and results indicated that TaSdr-B1 was significantly associated with GI. Analysis of the allelic distribution at the TaSdr-B1 locus showed that the frequencies of TaSdr-B1a associated with a lower GI were high in cultivars from Japan, Australia, Argentina, and the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valley Winter Wheat Region and Southwest Winter Wheat Region in China. This study provides not only a reliable functional marker for molecular-assisted selection of PHS in wheat breeding programs, but also gives novel information for a comprehensive understanding of seed dormancy.
24684436	Multiple phytohormones and phytoalexins are involved in disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae invaded from roots in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	Blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads to the biosynthesis of defense-related phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) and flavonoid-type phytoalexins sakuranetin and naringenin. However, the roles and biochemical features of individual rice PALs in defense responses to pathogens remain unclear. Here, we report that rice OsPAL06, which can catalyze the formation of trans-cinnamate using l-phenylalanine, is involved in rice root-M. oryzae interaction. OsPAL06-knockout mutant showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae invaded from roots and developed typical leaf blast symptoms, accompanied by nearly complete disappearance of sakuranetin and naringenin and a two-third reduction of the SA level in roots. This mutant also showed compensatively induced expression of chalcone synthase, which is involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, isochorismate synthase 1, which is putatively involved in SA synthesis via another pathway, reduced jasmonate content and increased ethylene content. These results suggest that OsPAL06 is a positive regulator in preventing M. oryzae infection from roots. It may regulate defense by promoting both phytoalexin accumulation and SA signaling that synergistically and antagonistically interacts with jasmonate- and ethylene-dependent signaling, respectively.
24688390	Overexpression of a Vesicle Trafficking Gene, OsRab7, enhances salt tolerance in rice.	2014	ScientificWorldJournal	High soils salinity is a main factor affecting agricultural production. Studying the function of salt-tolerance-related genes is essential to enhance crop tolerance to stress. Rab7 is a small GTP-binding protein that is distributed widely among eukaryotes. Endocytic trafficking mediated by Rab7 plays an important role in animal and yeast cells, but the current understanding of Rab7 in plants is still very limited. Herein, we isolated a vesicle trafficking gene, OsRab7, from rice. Transgenic rice over-expressing OsRab7 exhibited enhanced seedling growth and increased proline content under salt-treated conditions. Moreover, an increased number of vesicles was observed in the root tip of OsRab7 transgenic rice. The OsRab7 over-expression plants showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress, suggesting that vacuolar trafficking is important for salt tolerance in plants.
24430865	The rice OsDG2 encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: OsDG2 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted GRP in rice. Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice. Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) participate in various biological processes in plants. However, the evidence of GRPs involved in chloroplast development in plants is quite limited. In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named osdg2 (O ryza s ativa d elayed g reening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three-leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green. Further study showed that the mutant phenotype was consistent with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. The rice OsDG2 gene, encoding a novel GRP protein, was located on chromosome 2 through map-based cloning method and confirmed by molecular complementation tests. Subcellular localization results showed that OsDG2 was targeted in chloroplasts. In addition, the OsDG2 transcripts were highly expressed in leaves and undetectable in other tissues, showing the tissue-specific expression. In osdg2 mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild-type level in the 4th leaves. Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
24475234	OsGA2ox5, a gibberellin metabolism enzyme, is involved in plant growth, the root gravity response and salt stress.	2014	PLoS One	Gibberellin (GA) 2-oxidases play an important role in the GA catabolic pathway through 2β-hydroxylation. There are two classes of GA2oxs, i.e., a larger class of C₁₉-GA2oxs and a smaller class of C₂₀-GA2oxs. In this study, the gene encoding a GA 2-oxidase of rice, Oryza sativa GA 2-oxidase 5 (OsGA2ox5), was cloned and characterized. BLASTP analysis showed that OsGA2ox5 belongs to the C₂₀-GA2oxs subfamily, a subfamily of GA2oxs acting on C₂₀-GAs (GA₁₂, GA₅₃). Subcellular localization of OsGA2ox5-YFP in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells revealed the presence of this protein in both of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Real-time PCR analysis, along with GUS staining, revealed that OsGA2ox5 is expressed in the roots, culms, leaves, sheaths and panicles of rice. Rice plants overexpressing OsGA2ox5 exhibited dominant dwarf and GA-deficient phenotypes, with shorter stems and later development of reproductive organs than the wild type. The dwarfism phenotype was partially rescued by the application of exogenous GA3 at a concentration of 10 µM. Ectopic expression of OsGA2ox5 cDNA in Arabidopsis resulted in a similar phenotype. Real-time PCR assays revealed that both GA synthesis-related genes and GA signaling genes were expressed at higher levels in transgenic rice plants than in wild-type rice; OsGA3ox1, which encodes a key enzyme in the last step of the bioactive GAs synthesis pathway, was highly expressed in transgenic rice. The roots of OsGA2ox5-ox plants exhibited increased starch granule accumulation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Furthermore, rice and Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsGA2ox5 were more resistant to high-salinity stress than wild-type plants. These results suggest that OsGA2ox5 plays important roles in GAs homeostasis, development, gravity responses and stress tolerance in rice.
24486766	A novel AP2-type transcription factor, SMALL ORGAN SIZE1, controls organ size downstream of an auxin signaling pathway.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	The organ size of flowering plants is determined by two post-embryonic developmental events: cell proliferation and cell expansion. In this study, we identified a new rice loss-of-function mutant, small organ size1 (smos1), that decreases the final size of various organs due to decreased cell size and abnormal microtubule orientation. SMOS1 encodes an unusual APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor with an imperfect AP2 domain, and its product belongs to the basal AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) lineage, including WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and ADAP. SMOS1 expression was induced by exogenous auxin treatment, and the auxin response element (AuxRE) of the SMOS1 promoter acts as a cis-motif through interaction with auxin response factor (ARF). Furthermore, a functional fluorophore-tagged SMOS1 was localized to the nucleus, supporting the role of SMOS1 as a transcriptional regulator for organ size control. Microarray analysis showed that the smos1 mutation represses expression of several genes involved in microtubule-based movement and DNA replication. Among the down-regulated genes, we demonstrated by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments that OsPHI-1, which is involved in cell expansion, is a target of SMOS1. SMOS1 homologs in early-diverged land plants partially rescued the smos1 phenotype of rice. We propose that SMOS1 acts as an auxin-dependent regulator for cell expansion during organ size control, and that its function is conserved among land plants.
24667379	Overexpression of OsMYB48-1, a novel MYB-related transcription factor, enhances drought and salinity tolerance in rice.	2014	PLoS One	MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
24410960	The 9-lipoxygenase Osr9-LOX1 interacts with the 13-lipoxygenase-mediated pathway to regulate resistance to chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	Oxylipins produced by the 13-lipoxygenase (LOX) have been reported to play an important role in plant defense responses to herbivores. Yet, the role of oxylipins produced by the 9-LOX pathway in this process remains largely unknown. Here we cloned a gene encoding a chloroplast-localized 9-LOX, Osr9-LOX1, from rice. Transcriptional analysis revealed that herbivore infestation, mechanical wounding and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment either repressed or did not enhance the level of Osr9-LOX1 transcripts at early stages but did at later stages, whereas salicylic acid (SA) treatment quickly increased the transcript level of Osr9-LOX1. Antisense expression of Osr9-lox1 (as-r9lox1) decreased the amount of wound-induced (Z)-3-hexenal but increased levels of striped stem borer (SSB)-induced linolenic acid, JA, SA and trypsin protease inhibitors. These changes were associated with increased resistance in rice to the larvae of the SSB Chilo suppressalis. In contrast, although no significant differences were observed in the duration of the nymph stage or the number of eggs laid by female adults between the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens that fed on as-r9lox1 lines and BPH that fed on wild-type (WT) rice plants, the survival rate of BPH nymphs that fed on as-r9lox1 lines was higher than that of nymphs that fed on WT plants, possibly because of a higher JA level. The results demonstrate that Osr9-LOX1 plays an important role in regulating an herbivore-induced JA burst and cross-talk between JA and SA, and in controlling resistance in rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.
24413763	Transgenic rice endosperm as a bioreactor for molecular pharming.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Plants provide a promising expression platform for producing recombinant proteins with several advantages in terms of high expression level, lower production cost, scalability, and safety and environment-friendly. Molecular pharming has been recognized as an emerging industry with strategic importance that could play an important role in economic development and healthcare in China. Here, this review represents the significant advances using transgenic rice endosperm as bioreactor to produce various therapeutic recombinant proteins in transgenic rice endosperm and large-scale production of OsrHSA, and discusses the challenges to develop molecular pharming as an emerging industry with strategic importance in China.
24410953	Expression of abiotic stress inducible ETHE1-like protein from rice is higher in roots and is regulated by calcium.	2014	Physiol Plant	ETHYLMALONIC ENCEPHALOPATHY PROTEIN 1 (ETHE1) encodes sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) activity regulating sulfide levels in living organisms. It is an essential gene and mutations in ETHE1 leads to ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) in humans and embryo lethality in Arabidopsis. At present, very little is known regarding the role of ETHE1 beyond the context of EE and almost nothing is known about factors affecting its regulation in plant systems. In this study, we have identified, cloned and characterized OsETHE1, a gene encoding ETHE1-like protein from Oryza sativa. ETHE1 proteins in general are most similar to glyoxalase II (GLYII) and hence OsETHE1 has been earlier annotated as OsGLYII1, a putative GLYII gene. Here we show that OsETHE1 lacks GLYII activity and is instead an ETHE1 homolog being localized in mitochondria like its human and Arabidopsis counterparts. We have isolated and analyzed 1618 bp OsETHE1 promoter (pOsETHE1) to examine the factors affecting OsETHE1 expression. For this, transcriptional promoter pOsETHE1: 5-bromo-5-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide (GUS) fusion construct was made and stably transformed into rice. GUS expression pattern of transgenic pOsETHE1:GUS plants reveal a high root-specific expression of OsETHE1. The pOsETHE1 activity was stimulated by Ca(II) and required light for induction. Moreover, pOsETHE1 activity was induced under various abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity and oxidative stress, suggesting a potential role of OsETHE1 in stress response.
24381099	The promoter and the 5'-untranslated region of rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene are capable of directing high-level gene expression in germinated rice embryos.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Critical regions within the rice metallothionein OsMT2b gene promoter are identified and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) is found essential for the high-level promoter activity in germinated transgenic rice embryos. Many metallothionein (MT) genes are highly expressed in plant tissues. A rice subfamily p2 (type 2) MT gene, OsMT2b, has been shown previously to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling. In the present study, transient expression assays and a transgenic approach were employed to characterize the expression of the OsMT2b gene in rice. We found that the OsMT2b gene is strongly and differentially expressed in germinated rice embryos during seed germination and seedling development. Histochemical staining analysis of transgenic rice carrying OsMT2b::GUS chimeric gene showed that high-level GUS activity was detected in germinated embryos and at the meristematic part of other tissues during germination. Deletion analysis of the OsMT2b promoter revealed that the 5'-flanking region of the OsMT2b between nucleotides -351 and -121 relative to the transcriptional initiation site is important for promoter activity in rice embryos, and this region contains the consensus sequences of G box and TA box. Our study demonstrates that the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of OsMT2b gene is not only necessary for the OsMT2b promoter activity, but also sufficient to augment the activity of a minimal promoter in both transformed cell cultures and germinated transgenic embryos in rice. We also found that addition of the maize Ubi intron 1 significantly enhanced the OsMT2b promoter activity in rice embryos. Our studies reveal that OsMT2b351-ubi(In) promoter can be applied in plant transformation and represents potential for driving high-level production of foreign proteins in transgenic rice.
24492003	Functional analysis of the C-terminal region of the vacuolar cadmium-transporting rice OsHMA3.	2014	FEBS Lett	Rice OsHMA3 is a vacuolar cadmium (Cd) transporter belonging to the P1B-ATPase family and has a long (273aa) C-terminal region. We analyzed the function of the region related to Cd using the transgenic Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype, which is sensitive to Cd. The OsHMA3 variant containing a truncated (58aa) C-terminal region did not confer Cd tolerance, whereas an OsHMA3 variant containing a longer truncated (105aa) C-terminal region conferred Cd tolerance to transgenic Arabidopsis. We conclude that the C-terminal region, particularly the region containing the first 105aa, has an important role in OsHMA3 activity.
24498911	An evaluation of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to map the Breviaristatum-e (ari-e) locus in cultivated barley.	2014	BMC Genomics	UNLABELLED: We explored the use of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) on a recombinant inbred line population (GPMx) derived from a cross between the two-rowed barley cultivar 'Golden Promise' (ari-e.GP/Vrs1) and the six-rowed cultivar 'Morex' (Ari-e/vrs1) to map plant height. We identified three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL), the first in a region encompassing the spike architecture gene Vrs1 on chromosome 2H, the second in an uncharacterised centromeric region on chromosome 3H, and the third in a region of chromosome 5H coinciding with the previously described dwarfing gene Breviaristatum-e (Ari-e).

BACKGROUND: Barley cultivars in North-western Europe largely contain either of two dwarfing genes; Denso on chromosome 3H, a presumed ortholog of the rice green revolution gene OsSd1, or Breviaristatum-e (ari-e) on chromosome 5H. A recessive mutant allele of the latter gene, ari-e.GP, was introduced into cultivation via the cv. 'Golden Promise' that was a favourite of the Scottish malt whisky industry for many years and is still used in agriculture today.

RESULTS: Using GBS mapping data and phenotypic measurements we show that ari-e.GP maps to a small genetic interval on chromosome 5H and that alternative alleles at a region encompassing Vrs1 on 2H along with a region on chromosome 3H also influence plant height. The location of Ari-e is supported by analysis of near-isogenic lines containing different ari-e alleles. We explored use of the GBS to populate the region with sequence contigs from the recently released physically and genetically integrated barley genome sequence assembly as a step towards Ari-e gene identification.

CONCLUSIONS: GBS was an effective and relatively low-cost approach to rapidly construct a genetic map of the GPMx population that was suitable for genetic analysis of row type and height traits, allowing us to precisely position ari-e.GP on chromosome 5H. Mapping resolution was lower than we anticipated. We found the GBS data more complex to analyse than other data types but it did directly provide linked SNP markers for subsequent higher resolution genetic analysis.
24733018	Identification, molecular cloning and expression analysis of five RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes in Salvia miltiorrhiza.	2014	PLoS One	RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) act as key components of the small RNA biogenesis pathways and play significant roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and antiviral defense. However, there is no information about the RDR gene family in Salvia miltiorrhiza, an emerging model medicinal plant with great economic value. Through genome-wide predication and subsequent molecular cloning, five full-length S. miltiorrhiza RDR genes, termed SmRDR1-SmRDR5, were identified. The length of SmRDR cDNAs varies between 3,262 (SmRDR5) and 4,130 bp (SmRDR3). The intron number of SmRDR genes varies from 3 (SmRDR1, SmRDR3 and SmRDR4) to 17 (SmRDR5). All of the deduced SmRDR protein sequences contain the conserved RdRp domain. Moreover, SmRDR2 and SmRDR4 have an additional RRM domain. Based on the phylogenetic tree constructed with sixteen RDRs from Arabidopsis, rice and S. miltiorrhiza, plant RDRs may be divided into four groups (RDR1-RDR4). The RDR1 group contains an AtRDR and an OsRDR, while includes two SmRDRs. On the contrary, the RDR3 group contains three AtRDRs and two OsRDRs, but has only one SmRDR. SmRDRs were differentially expressed in flowers, leaves, stems and roots of S. miltiorrhiza and responsive to methyl jasmonate treatment and cucumber mosaic virus infection. The results suggest the involvement of RDRs in S. miltiorrhiza development and response to abiotic and biotic stresses. It provides a foundation for further studying the regulation and biological functions of SmRDRs and the biogenesis pathways of small RNAs in S. miltiorrhiza.
24647160	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice.	2014	Nat Commun	The spikelet is the basal unit of inflorescence in grasses, and its formation is crucial for reproductive success and cereal yield. Here, we report a previously unknown role of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in determining rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet morphogenesis. The extra glume 1 (eg1) and eg2 mutants exhibit altered spikelet morphology with changed floral organ identity and number, as well as defective floral meristem determinacy. We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development. OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development. This work discovers a key regulatory mechanism of grass spikelet development and suggests that the role of JA in reproduction has diversified during the flowering plant evolution.
24551849	Synergistic exposure of rice seeds to different doses of γ-ray and salinity stress resulted in increased antioxidant enzyme activities and gene-specific modulation of TC-NER pathway.	2014	Biomed Res Int	Recent reports have underlined the potential of gamma (γ)-rays as tools for seed priming, a process used in seed industry to increase seed vigor and to enhance plant tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses. However, the impact of γ -rays on key aspects of plant metabolism still needs to be carefully evaluated. In the present study, rice seeds were challenged with different doses of γ -rays and grown in absence/presence of NaCl to assess the impact of these treatments on the early stages of plant life. Enhanced germination efficiency associated with increase in radicle and hypocotyl length was observed, while at later stages no increase in plant tolerance to salinity stress was evident. APX, CAT, and GR were enhanced at transcriptional level and in terms of enzyme activity, indicating the activation of antioxidant defence. The profiles of DNA damage accumulation were obtained using SCGE and the implication of TC-NER pathway in DNA damage sensing and repair mechanisms is discussed. OsXPB2, OsXPD, OsTFIIS, and OsTFIIS-like genes showed differential modulation in seedlings and plantlets in response to γ -irradiation and salinity stress. Altogether, the synergistic exposure to γ -rays and NaCl resulted in enhanced oxidative stress and proper activation of antioxidant mechanisms, thus being compatible with plant survival.
24709840	Overexpression of OsSWEET5 in rice causes growth retardation and precocious senescence.	2014	PLoS One	As a novel sugar transporter family, SWEETs play important roles in plant growth and development. Here, we characterized a SWEET gene named OsSWEET5 through its overexpression in rice. Heterologous expression assay indicated that OsSWEET5 encoded a galactose transporter in yeast. OsSWEET5-overexpressing plants displayed the phenotypes of growth retardation and precocious senescence at seedling stage. GC-MS analysis showed that the sugar levels were largely altered in the leaves of the OsSWEET5-overexpressing plants. Molecular analysis revealed that these phenotypes might be due to the transcriptional changes of the genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport. In addition, the transgenic plants showed a lower level of auxin with altered transcription of genes involved in auxin signaling and translocation pathways. However, no obvious phenotype was observed between the amiRNA-OsSWEET5 transgenic lines and WT plants, which could be a result of the functional redundancy of the galactose transporters in rice. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsSWEET5 plays a crucial role in regulating the crosstalk between sugar and auxin in rice.
24614601	Emerging features of ER resident J-proteins in plants.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	J-proteins are co-chaperone components of the HSP70 system. J-proteins stimulate Hsp70ATPase activity, which is responsible for stabilizing the interaction of Hsp70 with client proteins. J-proteins are localized in various intracellular compartments including the cytoplasm, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Five types of ER resident J-proteins (ERdjs) have been found in plants (P58, ERdj2, ERdj2A, ERdj3B and ERdj7). Rice OsERdj3A is located in the vacuoleand protein storage vacuoles (PSV, PB-II) under conditions of ER stress. J-proteins that are localized to the vacuole or lysosome are not found in mammals and yeast, suggesting that the presence of OsERdj3A in the vacuole is plant-specific and one of the features unique to plant ERdjs. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge andrecent research advancements regarding plant ERdjs, and compare mammalian and yeast ERdjs with plant ERdjs.
24597623	OsMOGS is required for N-glycan formation and auxin-mediated root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Plant J	N-glycosylation is a major modification of glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells. In Arabidopsis, great progress has been made in functional analysis of N-glycan production, however there are few studies in monocotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L.) osmogs mutant with shortened roots and isolated a gene that coded a putative mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (OsMOGS), an ortholog of α-glucosidase I in Arabidopsis, which trims the terminal glucosyl residue of the oligosaccharide chain of nascent peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). OsMOGS is strongly expressed in rapidly cell-dividing tissues and OsMOGS protein is localized in the ER. Mutation of OsMOGS entirely blocked N-glycan maturation and inhibited high-mannose N-glycan formation. The osmogs mutant exhibited severe defects in root cell division and elongation, resulting in a short-root phenotype. In addition, osmogs plants had impaired root hair formation and elongation, and reduced root epidemic cell wall thickness due to decreased cellulose synthesis. Further analysis showed that auxin content and polar transport in osmogs roots were reduced due to incomplete N-glycosylation of the B subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins (ABCBs). Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsMOGS in N-glycan formation is required for auxin-mediated root development in rice.
24289830	The rice OsV4 encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is required for chloroplast development during the early leaf stage under cold stress.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, characterized by tandem arrays of a 35 amino acid motif, have been suggested to play central and broad roles in modulating the expression of organelle genes in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms of most rice PPR genes remains unclear. In this paper, we isolated and characterized a temperature-conditional virescent mutant, OsV4, in rice (Oryza sativa cultivar Jiahua1 (WT, japonica rice variety)). The mutant displays albino phenotype and abnormal chloroplasts at the three leaf stage, which gradually turns green after the four leaf stage at a low temperature (20 °C). But the mutant always develops green leaves and well-developed chloroplasts at a high temperature (32 °C). Genetic and molecular analyses uncovered that OsV4 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein including four PPR motifs. Further investigations show that the mutant phenotype is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. The OsV4 transcripts only accumulate to high levels in young leaves, indicating that its expression is tissue-specific. In addition, transcript levels of some ribosomal components and plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent genes are dramatically reduced in the albino mutants grown at 20 °C. These findings suggest that OsV4 plays an important role during early chloroplast development under cold stress in rice.
24641694	A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice.	2014	Plant J	Submergence and drought are major limiting factors for crop production. However, very limited studies have been reported on the distinct or overlapping mechanisms of plants in response to the two water extremes. Here we report an ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER 1-like gene (OsETOL1) that modulates differentially drought and submergence tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two allelic mutants of OsETOL1 showed increased resistance to drought stress at the panicle development stage. Interestingly, the mutants exhibited a significantly slower growth rate under submergence stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages. Over-expression (OE) of OsETOL1 in rice resulted in reverse phenotypes when compared with the mutants. The OsETOL1 transcript was differentially responsive to abiotic stresses. OsETOL1 was found to interact with OsACS2, a homolog of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis. In the osacs2 mutant and OsETOL1-OE plants, ACC and ethylene content were decreased significantly, and exogenous ACC restored the phenotype of osetol1 and OsETOL1-OE to wild-type under submergence stress, implying a negative role for OsETOL1 in ethylene biosynthesis. The expression of several genes related to carbohydrate catabolism and fermentation showed significant changes in the osetol1 and OsETOL1-OE plants, implying that OsETOL1 may affect energy metabolism. These results together suggest that OsETOL1 plays distinct roles in drought and submergence tolerance by modulating ethylene production and energy metabolism. Findings from the expression and functional comparison of three ethylene overproducer (ETOL) family members in rice further supported the specific role of OsETOL1 in the responses to the two water stresses.
24401104	Two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Mutations in the photorespiration pathway display a lethal phenotype in atmospheric air, which can be fully recovered by elevated CO2 . An exception is that mutants of peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR1) do not have this phenotype, indicating the presence of cytosolic bypass in the photorespiration pathway. In this study, we constructed overexpression of the OsHPR1 gene and RNA interference plants of OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 genes in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhonghua 11). Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and enzyme assays showed that HPR1 activity changed significantly in corresponding transgenic lines without any effect on HPR2 activity, which is the same for HPR2. However, metabolite analysis and the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT) activity assay showed that the metabolite flux of photorespiration was disturbed in RNAi lines of both HPR genes. Furthermore, HPR1 and HPR2 proteins were located to the peroxisome and cytosol, respectively, by transient expression experiment. Double mutant hpr1 × hpr2 was generated by crossing individual mutant of hpr1 and hpr2. The phenotypes of all transgenic lines were determined in ambient air and CO2 -elevated air. The phenotype typical of photorespiration mutants was observed only where activity of both HPR1 and HPR2 were downregulated in the same line. These findings demonstrate that two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice.
24464125	Isolation and characterization of OsMY1, a putative partner of OsRac5 from Oryza sativa L.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	OsRac5 belongs to the rice Rho of plants family, and acts as the molecular switch in the signal pathway which is pivotally involved in the rice fertility control. One of its putative partners, OsMY1, was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening from rice panicle cDNA library. Bioinformatics analysis shows that OsMY1 contains a coiled-coil domain which generally appeared in the partners of Rho GTPases. By yeast two-hybrid assay, it is confirmed that OsMY1 binds both the wild type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) OsRac5, but does not interact with dominantly negative OsRac5. In addition, the interactions between OsMY1 and WT-OsRac5 or CA-OsRac5 in vivo are demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Using PCR-mediated sequence deletion and point mutation of OsMY1, the interaction between OsMY1 and OsRac5 was identified to be mediated by the coiled-coil domain in OsMY1, and their binding was quantified by O-nitro-phenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside assay. Real-time PCR shows that OsMY1 and OsRac5 are coordinately expressed in rice leaves and panicles with similar expression patterns. Our results suggest that OsMY1 is an important target of OsRac5 and that these two genes are involved in the same biological processes in rice growth and development.
24525904	Functional roles of rice glycosyltransferase family GT43 in xylan biosynthesis.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Xylan is the major hemicellulose present in both primary and secondary cell walls of rice vegetative tissues. Since xylan is one of the factors contributing to biomass recalcitrance, understanding how xylan is synthesized in rice will potentially provide tools to modify grass biomass composition better suited for biofuel production. Studies of xylan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis have revealed that family GT43 glycosyltransferases, which form 2 functionally nonredundant groups, IRX9/IRX9 homolog and IRX14/IRX14 homolog, are required for xylan backbone elongation. The rice genome harbors 10 genes encoding family GT43 members and it is currently unknown whether they are all involved in xylan biosynthesis. In this report, we performed biochemical analysis of xylan xylosyltransferase activity in rice stem microsomes and investigated the roles of 4 representative rice GT43 members, OsGT43A (LOC_Os05 g03174), OsGT43E (LOC_Os05 g48600), OsGT43H (LOC_Os04 g01280), and OsGT43J (LOC_Os06 g47340), in xylan biosynthesis. OsGT43 proteins were shown to be localized in the Golgi, where xylan biosynthesis occurs. Complementation analysis by expression of OsGT43s in Arabidopsis irx9 and irx14 mutants demonstrated that OsGT43A and OsGT43E but not OsGT43H and OsGT43J were able to rescue the mutant phenotypes conferred by the irx9 mutation, including defective stem mechanical strength, vessel morphology, xylan content, GlcA side chains, xylan chain length, and xylosyltransferase activity. On the other hand, OsGT43J but not OsGT43A, OsGT43E, and OsGT43H restored the defective xylan phenotype in the irx14 mutant. These results indicate that the rice GT43 family evolved to retain the involvement of 2 functionally nonredundant groups, OsGT43A and OsGT43E (IRX9 homologs) vs. OsGT43J (an IRX14 homolog), in xylan backbone biosynthesis.
24528386	Normal root elongation requires arginine produced by argininosuccinate lyase in rice.	2014	Plant J	Plant roots play an important role in the uptake of water and nutrients, structural support and environmental sensing, but the molecular mechanisms involved in root development are poorly understood in rice (Oryza sativa), which is characterized by a dense fibrous root system. Here we report a rice mutant (red1 for root elongation defect 1) with short roots. Morphological and physiological analyses showed that the mutant had a shorter length from the quiescent center (QC) to the starting point of the elongation zone but a similar cell size and number of lateral and crown roots compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the mutant had similar radial structure and nutrient uptake patterns to the wild type. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotype was caused by a point mutation of a gene encoding an argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), catalyzing the last step of arginine biosynthesis. The OsASL1 gene has two distinct transcripts, OsASL1.1 and OsASL1.2, which result from different transcription start sites, but only OsASL1.1 was able to complement the mutant phenotype. OsASL1.1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots. The protein encoded by OsASL1.1 showed ASL activity in yeast. OsALS1.1 was localized to the plastid. The short root of the mutant was rescued by exogenous addition of arginine, but not by other amino acids. These results indicate that arginine produced by ASL is required for normal root elongation in rice.
24661284	A unique Ni2+ -dependent and methylglyoxal-inducible rice glyoxalase I possesses a single active site and functions in abiotic stress response.	2014	Plant J	The glyoxalase system constitutes the major pathway for the detoxification of metabolically produced cytotoxin methylglyoxal (MG) into a non-toxic metabolite D-lactate. Glyoxalase I (GLY I) is an evolutionarily conserved metalloenzyme requiring divalent metal ions for its activity: Zn(2+) in the case of eukaryotes or Ni(2+) for enzymes of prokaryotic origin. Plant GLY I proteins are part of a multimember family; however, not much is known about their physiological function, structure and metal dependency. In this study, we report a unique GLY I (OsGLYI-11.2) from Oryza sativa (rice) that requires Ni(2+) for its activity. Its biochemical, structural and functional characterization revealed it to be a monomeric enzyme, possessing a single Ni(2+) coordination site despite containing two GLY I domains. The requirement of Ni(2+) as a cofactor by an enzyme involved in cellular detoxification suggests an essential role for this otherwise toxic heavy metal in the stress response. Intriguingly, the expression of OsGLYI-11.2 was found to be highly substrate inducible, suggesting an important mode of regulation for its cellular levels. Heterologous expression of OsGLYI-11.2 in Escherichia coli and model plant Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) resulted in improved adaptation to various abiotic stresses caused by increased scavenging of MG, lower Na(+) /K(+) ratio and maintenance of reduced glutathione levels. Together, our results suggest interesting links between MG cellular levels, its detoxification by GLY I, and Ni(2+) - the heavy metal cofactor of OsGLYI-11.2, in relation to stress response and adaptation in plants.
24450597	Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa.	2014	J Integr Plant Biol	Katanin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, consists of two subunits: the catalytic subunit P60, and the regulatory subunit P80. In several species, P80 functions in meiotic spindle organization, the flagella biogenesis, the neuronal development, and the male gamete production. However, the P80 function in higher plants remains elusive. In this study, we found that there are three katanin P80 orthologs (OsKTN80a, OsKTN80b, and OsKTN80c) in Oryza sativa L. Overexpression of OsKTN80a caused the retarded root growth of rice seedlings. Further investigation indicates that the retained root growth was caused by the repressed cell elongation in the elongation zone and the stalled cytokinesis in the division zone in the root tip. The in vivo examination suggests that OsKTN80a acts as a microtubule stabilizer. We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division.
24399239	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Plants respond to environmental stresses by altering gene expression, and several genes have been found to mediate stress-induced expression, but many additional factors are yet to be identified. OsNAP is a member of the NAC transcription factor family; it is localized in the nucleus, and shows transcriptional activator activity in yeast. Analysis of the OsNAP transcript levels in rice showed that this gene was significantly induced by ABA and abiotic stresses, including high salinity, drought and low temperature. Rice plants overexpressing OsNAP did not show growth retardation, but showed a significantly reduced rate of water loss, enhanced tolerance to high salinity, drought and low temperature at the vegetative stage, and improved yield under drought stress at the flowering stage. Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59). Our data suggest that OsNAP functions as a transcriptional activator that plays a role in mediating abiotic stress responses in rice.
24596329	OsmiR396d-regulated OsGRFs function in floral organogenesis in rice through binding to their targets OsJMJ706 and OsCR4.	2014	Plant Physiol	Inflorescence and spikelet development determine grain yields in cereals. Although multiple genes are known to be involved in the regulation of floral organogenesis, the underlying molecular network remains unclear in cereals. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) microRNA396d (OsmiR396d) and its Os Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) targets, together with Os Growth Regulating Factor-Interacting Factor1 (OsGIF1), are involved in the regulation of floral organ development through the rice JMJD2 family jmjC gene 706 (OsJMJ706) and crinkly4 receptor-like kinase (OsCR4). Transgenic knockdown lines of OsGRF6, a predicted target of OsmiR396d, and overexpression lines of OsmiR396d showed similar defects in floral organ development, including open husks, long sterile lemmas, and altered floral organ morphology. These defects were almost completely rescued by overexpression of OsGRF6. OsGRF6 and its ortholog OsGRF10 were the most highly expressed OsGRF family members in young inflorescences, and the grf6/grf10 double mutant displayed abnormal florets. OsGRF6/OsGRF10 localized to the nucleus, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 bind the GA response element in the promoters of OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, which were reported to participate in the regulation of floral organ development. In addition, OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 could transactivate OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, an activity that was enhanced in the presence of OsGIF1, which can bind both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10. Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4. This work thus reveals a microRNA-mediated regulation module for controlling spikelet development in rice.
24532604	Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.	2014	Plant Physiol	KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes are important regulators of meristem function, and a complex network of transcription factors ensures tight control of their expression. Here, we show that members of the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) family act as players in this network. A yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one-hybrid screen with the upstream sequence of the KNOX gene Oskn2 from rice (Oryza sativa) resulted in isolation of OsGRF3 and OsGRF10. Specific binding to a region in the untranslated leader sequence of Oskn2 was confirmed by yeast and in vitro binding assays. ProOskn2:β-glucuronidase reporter expression was down-regulated by OsGRF3 and OsGRF10 in vivo, suggesting that these proteins function as transcriptional repressors. Likewise, we found that the GRF protein BGRF1 from barley (Hordeum vulgare) could act as a repressor on an intron sequence in the KNOX gene Hooded/Barley Knotted3 (Bkn3) and that AtGRF4, AtGRF5, and AtGRF6 from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) could repress KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA2 (KNAT2) promoter activity. OsGRF overexpression phenotypes in rice were consistent with aberrant meristematic activity, showing reduced formation of tillers and internodes and extensive adventitious root/shoot formation on nodes. These effects were associated with down-regulation of endogenous Oskn2 expression by OsGRF3. Conversely, RNA interference silencing of OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF5 resulted in dwarfism, delayed growth and inflorescence formation, and up-regulation of Oskn2. These data demonstrate conserved interactions between the GRF and KNOX families of transcription factors in both monocot and dicot plants.
24361205	Analysis of quantitative trait loci affecting chlorophyll content of rice leaves in a double haploid population and two backcross populations.	2014	Gene	Chlorophyll content, one of the most important physiological parameters related to plant photosynthesis, is usually used to predict yield potential. To map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying the chlorophyll content of rice leaves, a double haploid (DH) population was developed from an indica/japonica (Zhenshan 97/Wuyujing 2) crossing and two backcross populations were established subsequently by backcrossing DH lines with each of their parents. The contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were determined by using a spectrophotometer to directly measure the leaf chlorophyll extracts. To determine the leaf chlorophyll retention along with maturation, all measurements were performed on the day of heading and were repeated 30 days later. A total of 60 QTLs were resolved for all the traits using these three populations. These QTLs were distributed on 10 rice chromosomes, except chromosomes 5 and 10; the closer the traits, the more clustering of the QTLs residing on common rice chromosomal regions. In general, the majority of QTLs that specify chlorophyll a content also play a role in determining chlorophyll b content. Strangely, chlorophyll content in this study was found mostly to be lacking or to have a negative correlation with yield. In both backcross F1 populations, overdominant (or underdominant) loci were more important than complete or partially dominant loci for main-effect QTLs and epistatic QTLs, thereby supporting previous findings that overdominant effects are the primary genetic basis for depression in inbreeding and heterosis in rice.
24315823	Identification and characterization of salt responsive miRNA-SSR markers in rice (Oryza sativa).	2014	Gene	Salinity is an important abiotic stress that affects agricultural production and productivity. It is a complex trait that is regulated by different molecular mechanisms. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs which are highly conserved and regulate gene expression. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are robust molecular markers for studying genetic diversity. Although several SSR markers are available now, challenge remains to identify the trait-specific SSRs which can be used for marker assisted breeding. In order to understand the genetic diversity of salt responsive-miRNA genes in rice, SSR markers were mined from 130 members of salt-responsive miRNA genes of rice and validated among the contrasting panels of tolerant as well as susceptible rice genotypes, each with 12 genotypes. Although 12 miR-SSRs were found to be polymorphic, only miR172b-SSR was able to differentiate the tolerant and susceptible genotypes in 2 different groups. It had also been found that miRNA genes were more diverse in susceptible genotypes than the tolerant one (as indicated by polymorphic index content) which might interfere to form the stem-loop structure of premature miRNA and their subsequent synthesis in susceptible genotypes. Thus, we concluded that length variations of the repeats in salt responsive miRNA genes may be responsible for a possible sensitivity to salinity adaptation. This is the first report of characterization of trait specific miRNA derived SSRs in plants.
24395781	Chitin-induced activation of immune signaling by the rice receptor CEBiP relies on a unique sandwich-type dimerization.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers various defense responses in plants. This MAMP-triggered immunity plays a major role in the plant resistance against various pathogens. To clarify the molecular basis of the specific recognition of chitin oligosaccharides by the rice PRR, CEBiP (chitin-elicitor binding protein), as well as the formation and activation of the receptor complex, biochemical, NMR spectroscopic, and computational studies were performed. Deletion and domain-swapping experiments showed that the central lysine motif in the ectodomain of CEBiP is essential for the binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Epitope mapping by NMR spectroscopy indicated the preferential binding of longer-chain chitin oligosaccharides, such as heptamer-octamer, to CEBiP, and also the importance of N-acetyl groups for the binding. Molecular modeling/docking studies clarified the molecular interaction between CEBiP and chitin oligosaccharides and indicated the importance of Ile122 in the central lysine motif region for ligand binding, a notion supported by site-directed mutagenesis. Based on these results, it was indicated that two CEBiP molecules simultaneously bind to one chitin oligosaccharide from the opposite side, resulting in the dimerization of CEBiP. The model was further supported by the observations that the addition of (GlcNAc)8 induced dimerization of the ectodomain of CEBiP in vitro, and the dimerization and (GlcNAc)8-induced reactive oxygen generation were also inhibited by a unique oligosaccharide, (GlcNβ1,4GlcNAc)4, which is supposed to have N-acetyl groups only on one side of the molecule. Based on these observations, we proposed a hypothetical model for the ligand-induced activation of a receptor complex, involving both CEBiP and Oryza sativa chitin-elicitor receptor kinase-1.
24406632	Soil and water warming accelerates phenology and down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis of rice plants grown under free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE).	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	To enable prediction of future rice production in a changing climate, we need to understand the interactive effects of temperature and elevated [CO2] (E[CO2]). We therefore examined if the effect of E[CO2] on the light-saturated leaf photosynthetic rate (Asat) was affected by soil and water temperature (NT, normal; ET, elevated) under open-field conditions at the rice free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility in Shizukuishi, Japan, in 2007 and 2008. Season-long E[CO2] (+200 µmol mol(-1)) increased Asat by 26%, when averaged over two years, temperature regimes and growth stages. The effect of ET (+2°C) on Asat was not significant at active tillering and heading, but became negative and significant at mid-grain filling; Asat in E[CO2]-ET was higher than in ambient [CO2] (A[CO2])-NT by only 4%. Photosynthetic down-regulation at E[CO2] also became apparent at mid-grain filling; Asat compared at the same [CO2] in the leaf cuvette was significantly lower in plants grown in E[CO2] than in those grown in A[CO2]. The additive effects of E[CO2] and ET decreased Asat by 23% compared with that of A[CO2]-NT plants. Although total crop nitrogen (N) uptake was increased by ET, N allocation to the leaves and to Rubisco was reduced under ET and E[CO2] at mid-grain filling, which resulted in a significant decrease (32%) in the maximum rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation on a leaf area basis. Because the change in N allocation was associated with the accelerated phenology in E[CO2]-ET plants, we conclude that soil and water warming accelerates photosynthetic down-regulation at E[CO2].
24554078	Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Transposable elements (TEs) and repetitive sequences make up over 35% of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. The host regulates the activity of different TEs by different epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone H3K9 methylation, and histone H3K4 demethylation. TEs can also affect the expression of host genes. For example, miniature inverted repeat TEs (MITEs), dispersed high copy-number DNA TEs, can influence the expression of nearby genes. In plants, 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are mainly derived from repeats and TEs. However, the extent to which TEs, particularly MITEs associated with 24-nt siRNAs, affect gene expression remains elusive. Here, we show that the rice Dicer-like 3 homolog OsDCL3a is primarily responsible for 24-nt siRNA processing. Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches. We used small RNA deep sequencing to identify 535,054 24-nt siRNA clusters. Of these clusters, ∼82% were OsDCL3a-dependent and showed significant enrichment of MITEs. Reduction of OsDCL3a function reduced the 24-nt siRNAs predominantly from MITEs and elevated expression of nearby genes. OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle. Our work identifies OsDCL3a-dependent 24-nt siRNAs derived from MITEs as broadly functioning regulators for fine-tuning gene expression, which may reflect a conserved epigenetic mechanism in higher plants with genomes rich in dispersed repeats or TEs.
24443497	Do the rich always become richer? Characterizing the leaf physiological response of the high-yielding rice cultivar Takanari to free-air CO2 enrichment.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	The development of crops which are well suited to growth under future environmental conditions such as higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) is essential to meeting the challenge of ensuring food security in the face of the growing human population and changing climate. A high-yielding indica rice variety (Oryza sativa L. cv. Takanari) has been recently identified as a potential candidate for such breeding, due to its high productivity in present [CO2]. To test if it could further increase its productivity under elevated [CO2] (eCO2), Takanari was grown in the paddy field under season-long free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE, approximately 200 µmol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]) and its leaf physiology was compared with the representative japonica variety 'Koshihikari'. Takanari showed consistently higher midday photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than Koshihikari under both ambient and FACE growth conditions over 2 years. Maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation and electron transport rates were higher for Takanari at the mid-grain filling stage in both years. Mesophyll conductance was higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari at the late grain-filling stage. In contrast to Koshihikari, Takanari grown under FACE conditions showed no decrease in total leaf nitrogen on an area basis relative to ambient-grown plants. Chl content was higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari at the same leaf nitrogen level. These results indicate that Takanari maintains its superiority over Koshihikari in regards to its leaf-level productivity when grown in elevated [CO2] and it may be a valuable resource for rice breeding programs which seek to increase crop productivity under current and future [CO2].
24488961	The rice TAL effector-dependent resistance protein XA10 triggers cell death and calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum.	2014	Plant Cell	The recognition between disease resistance (R) genes in plants and their cognate avirulence (Avr) genes in pathogens can produce a hypersensitive response of localized programmed cell death. However, our knowledge of the early signaling events of the R gene-mediated hypersensitive response in plants remains limited. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Xa10, a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-dependent R gene for resistance to bacterial blight in rice (Oryza sativa). Xa10 contains a binding element for the TAL effector AvrXa10 (EBEAvrXa10) in its promoter, and AvrXa10 specifically induces Xa10 expression. Expression of Xa10 induces programmed cell death in rice, Nicotiana benthamiana, and mammalian HeLa cells. The Xa10 gene product XA10 localizes as hexamers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is associated with ER Ca(2+) depletion in plant and HeLa cells. XA10 variants that abolish programmed cell death and ER Ca(2+) depletion in N. benthamiana and HeLa cells also abolish disease resistance in rice. We propose that XA10 is an inducible, intrinsic terminator protein that triggers programmed cell death by a conserved mechanism involving disruption of the ER and cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis.
24092883	Nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 exerts a negative effect on starch accumulation and growth in rice seedlings under high temperature and CO2 concentration conditions.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) is a widely distributed enzymatic activity occurring in both plants and mammals that catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of the pyrophosphate and phosphodiester bonds of a number of nucleotides. Unlike mammalian NPPs, the physiological function of plant NPPs remains largely unknown. Using a complete rice NPP1-encoding cDNA as a probe, in this work we have screened a rice shoot cDNA library and obtained complete cDNAs corresponding to six NPP genes (NPP1-NPP6). As a first step to clarify the role of NPPs, recombinant NPP1, NPP2 and NPP6 were purified from transgenic rice cells constitutively expressing NPP1, NPP2 and NPP6, respectively, and their enzymatic properties were characterized. NPP1 and NPP6 exhibited hydrolytic activities toward ATP, UDP-glucose and the starch precursor molecule, ADP-glucose, whereas NPP2 did not recognize nucleotide sugars as substrates, but hydrolyzed UDP, ADP and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate. To gain insight into the physiological function of rice NPP1, an npp1 knockout mutant was characterized. The ADP-glucose hydrolytic activities in shoots of npp1 rice seedlings were 8% of those of the wild type (WT), thus indicating that NPP1 is a major determinant of ADP-glucose hydrolytic activity in rice shoots. Importantly, when seedlings were cultured at 160 Pa CO2 under a 28°C/23°C (12 h light/12 h dark) regime, npp1 shoots and roots were larger than those of wild-type (WT) seedlings. Furthermore, the starch content in the npp1 shoots was higher than that of WT shoots. Growth and starch accumulation were also enhanced under an atmospheric CO2 concentration (40 Pa) when plants were cultured under a 33°C/28°C regime. The overall data strongly indicate that NPP1 exerts a negative effect on plant growth and starch accumulation in shoots, especially under high CO2 concentration and high temperature conditions.
24488962	GLUTELIN PRECURSOR ACCUMULATION3 encodes a regulator of post-Golgi vesicular traffic essential for vacuolar protein sorting in rice endosperm.	2014	Plant Cell	In seed plants, a major pathway for sorting of storage proteins to the protein storage vacuole (PSV) depends on the Golgi-derived dense vesicles (DVs). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the directional trafficking of DVs to PSVs remain largely elusive. Here, we report the functional characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa) glutelin precursor accumulation3 (gpa3) mutant, which exhibits a floury endosperm phenotype and accumulates excess proglutelins in dry seeds. Cytological and immunocytochemistry studies revealed that in the gpa3 mutant, numerous proglutelin-containing DVs are misrouted to the plasma membrane and, via membrane fusion, release their contents into the apoplast to form a new structure named the paramural body. Positional cloning of GPA3 revealed that it encodes a plant-specific kelch-repeat protein that is localized to the trans-Golgi networks, DVs, and PSVs in the developing endosperm. In vitro and in vivo experiments verified that GPA3 directly interacts with the rice Rab5a-guanine exchange factor VPS9a and forms a regulatory complex with Rab5a via VPS9a. Furthermore, our genetic data support the notion that GPA3 acts synergistically with Rab5a and VPS9a to regulate DV-mediated post-Golgi traffic in rice. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the plant-specific PSV pathway and expand our knowledge of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotes.
24464483	Natural variation of rice strigolactone biosynthesis is associated with the deletion of two MAX1 orthologs.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar Azucena--belonging to the Japonica subspecies--exudes high strigolactone (SL) levels and induces high germination of the root parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. Consistent with the fact that SLs also inhibit shoot branching, Azucena is a low-tillering variety. In contrast, Bala, an Indica cultivar, is a low-SL producer, stimulates less Striga germination, and is highly tillered. Using a Bala × Azucena F6 population, a major quantitative trait loci--qSLB1.1--for the exudation of SL, tillering, and induction of Striga germination was detected on chromosome 1. Sequence analysis of the corresponding locus revealed a rearrangement of a 51- to 59-kbp stretch between 28.9 and 29 Mbp in the Bala genome, resulting in the deletion of two cytochrome P450 genes--SLB1 and SLB2--with high homology to the Arabidopsis SL biosynthesis gene, MAX1. Both rice genes rescue the Arabidopsis max1-1 highly branched mutant phenotype and increase the production of the SL, ent-2'-epi-5-deoxystrigol, when overexpressed in Bala. Furthermore, analysis of this region in 367 cultivars of the publicly available Rice Diversity Panel population shows that the rearrangement at this locus is a recurrent natural trait associated with the Indica/Japonica divide in rice.
24330191	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice.	2014	Plant J	The awn is a long needle-like appendage that, in some grass species, is formed on the lemma that encloses floral organs together with the palea. In rice, most wild species and most strains of Oryza sativa ssp. indica generate an awn, whereas most strains of O. sativa ssp. japonica do not. In japonica, the long-awn characteristic appears to have been lost during domestication and breeding programs. Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath. Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that DL and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the top region of the lemma (a putative awn primordium) is larger in an awned floret than in an awnless floret. OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bundle. DL is expressed underneath the primordium at similar levels in both indica and japonica florets, suggesting non-cell-autonomous action. We hypothesize that loss of expression of OsETT2 in the awn primordium is probably associated with the failure of awn formation in japonica strains.
24388520	Uncovering legumain genes in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	Legumains are Asn specific cysteine proteases physiologically related to the biosynthesis of vacuolar components, degradation of storage proteins and programmed cell death. The present work identifies and characterizes the genic family of legumains in rice (Oryza sativa), which comprises five different loci. Rice legumains (OsaLegs) were ubiquitously detected in all plant tissues analyzed. However, phylogenetic analyses and gene expression studies demonstrated greater association of OsaLeg2 and OsaLeg3 to seed-related legumains, whereas OsaLeg1, 4 and 5 would act as vegetative-related proteases. Additionally, OsaLeg1 mRNA is strongly induced in senescent leaves. All rice legumain genes respond in different ways to environmental conditions such as wounding, salt and abscisic acid treatments. Mainly, wounding is capable of inducing all the four expressed genes OsaLeg1, 2, 3 and 4. Alternative splicing isoforms, with potential to generate pre-activated OsaLeg1 and OsaLeg2 nonvacuolar enzymes under different environmental situations were also observed.
24467907	Induction of phytic acid synthesis by abscisic acid in suspension-cultured cells of rice.	2014	Plant Sci	A pathway of phytic acid (PA) synthesis in plants has been revealed via investigations of low phytic acid mutants. However, the regulation of this pathway is not well understood because it is difficult to control the environments of cells in the seeds, where PA is mainly synthesized. We modified a rice suspension culture system in order to study the regulation of PA synthesis. Rice cells cultured with abscisic acid (ABA) accumulate PA at higher levels than cells cultured without ABA, and PA accumulation levels increase with ABA concentration. On the other hand, higher concentrations of sucrose or inorganic phosphorus do not affect PA accumulation. Mutations in the genes RINO1, OsMIK, OsIPK1 and OsLPA1 have each been reported to confer low phytic acid phenotypes in seeds. Each of these genes is upregulated in cells cultured with ABA. OsITPK4 and OsITPK6 are upregulated in cells cultured with ABA and in developing seeds. These results suggest that the regulation of PA synthesis is similar between developing seeds and cells in this suspension culture system. This system will be a powerful tool for elucidating the regulation of PA synthesis.
24372518	The pleiotropic SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 reveals that the 'empty glumes' of rice (Oryza sativa) spikelets are in fact rudimentary lemmas.	2014	New Phytol	The single floret of the rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet is subtended by a pair of enigmatic organs usually termed 'empty glumes' or 'sterile lemmas'. As the identity of these organs remains essentially unknown, we refer to them as 'organs of unknown identity' (OUIs). Here we present a novel mutant of the rice SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 which develops, in addition to disorganized branches and sterile seeds, elongated OUIs. The function and evolution of OsMADS34 were studied. Morphological and molecular markers indicate that the elongated OUIs have adopted lemma identity. Evolutionary analyses show that the ancestral genes of the OsM34 subclade evolved under positive selection, and that three specific motifs occur in the C-terminal region of proteins in the OsM34 subclade. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the C-terminal region of OsMADS34 plays a crucial role in mediating protein interactions. Sequence analyses for the wild rice Oryza grandiglumis which has elongated OUIs revealed the association of OsMADS34 functionality with OUI identity. Our findings support the hypothesis that OUIs originated from the lemmas of degenerate florets under the negative control of OsMADS34. As OUIs neither are homologues to glumes nor have the identity of lemmas any more, but originated from these organs, we suggest calling them 'rudimentary lemmas'.
24491113	OsPT2, a phosphate transporter, is involved in the active uptake of selenite in rice.	2014	New Phytol	• Selenite is a predominant form of selenium (Se) available to plants, especially in anaerobic soils, but the molecular mechanism of selenite uptake by plants is not well understood. • ltn1, a rice mutant previously shown to have increased phosphate (Pi) uptake, was found to exhibit higher selenite uptake than the wild-type in both concentration- and time-dependent selenite uptake assays. Respiratory inhibitors significantly inhibited selenite uptake in the wildtype and the ltn1 mutant, indicating that selenite uptake was coupled with H(+) and energy-dependent. Selenite uptake was greatly enhanced under Pi-starvation conditions, suggesting that Pi transporters are involved in selenite uptake. • OsPT2, the most abundantly expressed Pi transporter in the roots, is also significantly up-regulated in ltn1 and dramatically induced by Pi starvation. OsPT2-overexpressing and knockdown plants displayed significantly increased and decreased rates of selenite uptake, respectively, suggesting that OsPT2 plays a crucial role in selenite uptake. Se content in rice grains also increased significantly in OsPT2-overexpressing plants. • These data strongly demonstrate that selenite and Pi share similar uptake mechanisms and that OsPT2 is involved in selenite uptake, which provides a potential strategy for breeding Se-enriched rice varieties.
24105034	Oryza sativa polyamine oxidase 1 back-converts tetraamines, spermine and thermospermine, to spermidine.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: Oryza sativa polyamine oxidase 1 back-converts spermine (or thermospermine) to spermidine. Considering the previous work, major path of polyamine catabolism in rice plant is suggestive to be back-conversion but not terminal catabolism. Rice (Oryza sativa) contains seven genes encoding polyamine oxidases (PAOs), termed OsPAO1 to OsPAO7, based on their chromosomal number and gene ID number. We previously showed that three of these members, OsPAO3, OsPAO4 and OsPAO5, are abundantly expressed, that their products localize to peroxisomes and that they catalyze the polyamine back-conversion reaction. Here, we have focused on OsPAO1. The OsPAO1 gene product shares a high level of identity with those of Arabidopsis PAO5 and Brassica juncea PAO. Expression of OsPAO1 appears to be quite low under physiological conditions, but is markedly induced in rice roots by spermine (Spm) or T-Spm treatment. Consistent with the above finding, the recombinant OsPAO1 prefers T-Spm as a substrate at pH 6.0 and Spm at pH 8.5 and, in both cases, back-converts these tetraamines to spermidine, but not to putrescine. OsPAO1 localizes to the cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Differing in subcellular localization, four out of seven rice PAOs, OsPAO1, OsPAO3, OsPAO4 and OsPAO5, catalyze back-conversion reactions of PAs. Based on the results, we discuss the catabolic path(s) of PAs in rice plant.
24385091	Overexpression of OsZHD1, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor, induces abaxially curled and drooping leaf in rice.	2014	Planta	Leaf rolling is receiving considerable attention as an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, little has been known on the molecular mechanism of rice leaf rolling, especially the abaxial rolling. We identified a novel abaxially curled and drooping leaf-dominant mutant from a T₁ transgenic rice line. The abaxially curled leaf phenotypes, co-segregating with the inserted transferred DNA, were caused by overexpression of a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor (OsZHD1). OsZHD1 exhibited a constitutive expression pattern in wild-type plants and accumulated in the developing leaves and panicles. Artificial overexpression of OsZHD1 or its closest homolog OsZHD2 induced the abaxial leaf curling. Histological analysis indicated that both the increased number and the abnormal arrangement of bulliform cells in leaf were responsible for the abaxially curled leaves. We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice.
23621683	Reverse-genetic approach to verify physiological roles of rice phytoalexins: characterization of a knockdown mutant of OsCPS4 phytoalexin biosynthetic gene in rice.	2014	Physiol Plant	A variety of labdane-related diterpenoids, including phytocassanes, oryzalexins and momilactones, were identified as phytoalexins in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Momilactone B was also isolated as an allelochemical exuded from rice roots. The biosynthetic genes of these phytoalexins have been identified, including six labdane-related diterpene cyclase genes such as OsCPS2, OsCPS4, OsKSL4, OsKSL7, OsKSL8 and OsKSL10. Here we identified an OsCPS4 knockdown mutant, cps4-tos, by screening Tos17 mutant lines using polymerase chain reaction. OsCPS4 encodes a syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase responsible for momilactones and oryzalexin S biosynthesis. Because Tos17 was inserted into the third intron of OsCPS4, the mature OsCPS4 mRNA was detected in the cps4-tos mutant as well as the wild type. Nevertheless, mature OsCPS4 transcript levels in the cps4-tos mutant were about one sixth those in the wild type. The cps4-tos mutant was more susceptible to rice blast fungus than the wild type, possibly due to lower levels of momilactones and oryzalexin S in the mutant. Moreover, co-cultivation experiments suggested that the allelopathic effect of cps4-tos against some kinds of lowland weeds was significantly lower than that of the wild type, probably because of lower momilactone content exuded from cps4-tos roots. A reverse-genetic strategy using the cps4-tos mutant showed the possible roles of momilactones not only as phytoalexins but also as allelopathic substances.
24033451	Light induces jasmonate-isoleucine conjugation via OsJAR1-dependent and -independent pathways in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	The bioactive form of jasmonate is the conjugate of the amino acid isoleucine (Ile) with jasmonic acid (JA), which is biosynthesized in a reaction catalysed by the GH3 enzyme JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1). We examined the biochemical properties of OsJAR1 and its involvement in photomorphogenesis of rice (Oryza sativa). OsJAR1 has a similar substrate specificities as its orthologue in Arabidopsis. However, osjar1 loss-of-function mutants did not show as severe coleoptile phenotypes as the JA-deficient mutants coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, which develop long coleoptiles in all light qualities we examined. Analysis of hormonal contents in the young seedling stage revealed that osjar1 mutants are still able to synthesize JA-Ile conjugate in response to blue light, suggesting that a redundantly active enzyme can conjugate JA and Ile in rice seedlings. A good candidate for this enzyme is OsJAR2, which was found to be able to catalyse the conjugation of JA with Ile as well as with some additional amino acids. In contrast, if plants in the vegetative stage were mechanically wounded, the content of JA-Ile was severely reduced in osjar1, demonstrating that OsJAR1 is the most important JA-Ile conjugating enzyme in the wounding response during the vegetative stage.
24441161	A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input.	2014	Appl Environ Microbiol	Plants have mutualistic symbiotic relationships with rhizobia and fungi by the common symbiosis pathway, of which Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (encoded by CCaMK) is a central component. Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (OsCCaMK) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of OsCCaMK in rice symbiosis with bacteria. Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced OsCCaMK mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen (LN) and standard-nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild-type (WT) Nipponbare. The growth of NE1115 was significantly decreased compared with that of the WT, especially in the LN field. The CH4 flux of NE1115 in the LN field was significantly greater (156 to 407% in 2011 and 170 to 816% in 2012) than that of the WT, although no difference was observed in the SN field. The copy number of pmoA (encodes methane monooxygenase in methanotrophs) was significantly higher in the roots and rhizosphere soil of the WT than in those of NE1115. However, the mcrA (encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase in methanogens) copy number did not differ between the WT and NE1115. These results were supported by a (13)C-labeled CH4-feeding experiment. In addition, the natural abundance of (15)N in WT shoots (3.05‰) was significantly lower than in NE1115 shoots (3.45‰), suggesting greater N2 fixation in the WT because of dilution with atmospheric N2 (0.00‰). Thus, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the root zone of WT rice in the LN field and both processes are likely controlled by OsCCaMK.
23723154	OsVPS9A functions cooperatively with OsRAB5A to regulate post-Golgi dense vesicle-mediated storage protein trafficking to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm cells.	2013	Mol Plant	In the rice endosperm cells, glutelins are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum as proglutelins and are sorted to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) called protein body IIs (PBIIs), where they are converted to the mature forms. Dense vesicle (DV)-mediated trafficking of proglutelins in rice seeds has been proposed, but the post-Golgi control of this process is largely unknown. Whether DV can fuse directly with PSV is another matter of debate. In this study, we propose a regulatory mechanism underlying DV-mediated, post-Golgi proglutelin trafficking to PBII (PSV). gpa2, a loss-of-function mutant of OsVPS9A, which encodes a GEF of OsRAB5A, accumulated uncleaved proglutelins. Proglutelins were mis-targeted to the paramural bodies and to the apoplast along the cell wall in the form of DVs, which led to a concomitant reduction in PBII size. Previously reported gpa1, mutated in OsRab5a, has a similar phenotype, while gpa1gpa2 double mutant exacerbated the conditions. In addition, OsVPS9A interacted with OsRAB5A in vitro and in vivo. We concluded that OsVPS9A and OsRAB5A may work together and play a regulatory role in DV-mediated post-Golgi proglutelin trafficking to PBII (PSV). The evidence that DVs might fuse directly to PBII (PSV) to deliver cargos is also presented.
20202174	Transcriptome-wide identification of microRNA targets in rice.	2010	Plant J	MicroRNA (miRNA)-guided target RNA expression is vital for a wide variety of biological processes in eukaryotes. Currently, miRBase (version 13) lists 142 and 353 miRNAs from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. The integration of miRNAs in diverse biological networks relies upon the confirmation of their RNA targets. In contrast with the well-characterized miRNA targets that are cleaved in Arabidopsis, only a few such targets have been confirmed in rice. To identify small RNA targets in rice, we applied the 'degradome sequencing' approach, which globally identifies the remnants of small RNA-directed target cleavage by sequencing the 5' ends of uncapped RNAs. One hundred and sixty targets of 53 miRNA families (24 conserved and 29 rice-specific) and five targets of TAS3-small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were identified. Surprisingly, an additional conserved target for miR398, which has not been reported so far, has been validated. Besides conserved homologous transcripts, 23 non-conserved genes for nine conserved miRNAs and 56 genes for 29 rice-specific miRNAs were also identified as targets. Besides miRNA targets, the rice degradome contained fragments derived from MIRNA precursors. A closer inspection of these fragments revealed a unique pattern distinct from siRNA-producing loci. This attribute can serve as one of the ancillary criteria for separating miRNAs from siRNAs in plants.
24203183	Genetic and physical maps and a clone bank of mitochondrial DNA from rice.	1992	Theor Appl Genet	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was isolated from young green leaves of rice plants. DNA fragments were cloned into lambda DNA, and clones that hybridized to mitochondrial genes from other plants were selected. Distal restriction fragments of these clones were used as probes for the selection of overlapping clones. A genetic map was finally created from the library by "walking" along the genome. The mitochondrial genome consists of five basic circles, with each circle sharing homologous sequences with one or two other circles. A master circle was constructed from the results of recombination across repeated sequences, and its size was estimated to be 492 kb. A physical map and a bank of overlapping clones were also constructed.
12609030	Brassinosteroid functions in a broad range of disease resistance in tobacco and rice.	2003	Plant J	Brassinolide (BL), considered to be the most important brassinosteroid (BR) and playing pivotal roles in the hormonal regulation of plant growth and development, was found to induce disease resistance in plants. To study the potentialities of BL activity on stress responding systems, we analyzed its ability to induce disease resistance in tobacco and rice plants. Wild-type tobacco treated with BL exhibited enhanced resistance to the viral pathogen tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Pst), and the fungal pathogen Oidium sp. The measurement of salicylic acid (SA) in wild-type plants treated with BL and the pathogen infection assays using NahG transgenic plants indicate that BL-induced resistance does not require SA biosynthesis. BL treatment did not induce either acidic or basic pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression, suggesting that BL-induced resistance is distinct from systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and wound-inducible disease resistance. Analysis using brassinazole 2001, a specific inhibitor for BR biosynthesis, and the measurement of BRs in TMV-infected tobacco leaves indicate that steroid hormone-mediated disease resistance (BDR) plays part in defense response in tobacco. Simultaneous activation of SAR and BDR by SAR inducers and BL, respectively, exhibited additive protective effects against TMV and Pst, indicating that there is no cross-talk between SAR- and BDR-signaling pathway downstream of BL. In addition to the enhanced resistance to a broad range of diseases in tobacco, BL induced resistance in rice to rice blast and bacterial blight diseases caused by Magnaporthe grisea and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, respectively. Our data suggest that BDR functions in the innate immunity system of higher plants including dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species.
24231976	Mutants for rice storage proteins : 1. Screening of mutants for rice storage proteins of protein bodies in the starchy endosperm.	1988	Theor Appl Genet	To obtain genetic materials to breed qualitatively improved rice storage proteins, we screened about 3,000 mutant lines induced by the treatment of rice fertilized egg cell with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). The screening was performed by comparing the profiles of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with that of the original variety, Kinmaze, especially focussing on the changes in polypeptides present in two kinds of protein bodies, PB-I and PB-II. We selected 17 mutant lines and classified them into 4 types on the basis of variations of the relative contents of the polypeptides. Determination of extracted protein in the starchy endosperm of the mutants revealed changes in the content of prolamin and glutelin but not globulin. In some mutants there was marked accumulation of 57 kDa polypeptide concomitant with the remarkable reduction of glutelin subunits. Treatment of the fertilized egg cell with MNU was found to be an effective method to induce mutations for storage proteins in protein bodies of rice.
21689369	The scutellar vascular bundle-specific promoter of the wheat HD-Zip IV transcription factor shows similar spatial and temporal activity in transgenic wheat, barley and rice.	2012	Plant Biotechnol J	An HD-Zip IV gene from wheat, TaGL9, was isolated using a Y1H screen of a cDNA library prepared from developing wheat grain. TaGL9 has an amino acid sequence distinct from other reported members of the HD-Zip IV family. The 3' untranslated region of TaGL9 was used as a probe to isolate a genomic clone of the TaGL9 homologue from a BAC library prepared from Triticum durum L. cv. Langdon. The full-length gene containing a 3-kb-long promoter region was designated TdGL9H1. Spatial and temporal activity of TdGL9H1 was examined using promoter-GUS fusion constructs in transgenic wheat, barley and rice plants. Whole-mount and histochemical GUS staining patterns revealed grain-specific expression of TdGL9H1. GUS expression was initially observed between 3 and 8 days after pollination (DAP) in embryos at the globular stage and adjacent to the embryo fraction of the endosperm. Expression was strongest in the outer cell layer of the embryo. In developed wheat and barley embryos, strong activity of the promoter was only detected in the main vascular bundle of the scutellum, which is known to be responsible for the uptake of nutrients from the endosperm during germination and the endosperm-dependent phase of seedling development. Furthermore, this pattern of GUS staining was observed in dry seeds several weeks after harvesting but quickly disappeared during imbibition. The promoter of this gene could be a useful tool for engineering of early seedling vigour and protecting the endosperm to embryo axis pathway from pathogens during grain desiccation and storage.
21498073	DiSC (direct saccharification of culms) process for bioethanol production from rice straw.	2011	Bioresour Technol	A simple process (the direct-saccharification-of-culms (DiSC) process) to produce ethanol from rice straw culms, accumulating significant amounts of soft carbohydrates (SCs: glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch and β-1,3-1,4-glucan) was developed. This study focused on fully mature culms of cv. Leafstar, containing 69.2% (w/w of dried culms) hexoses from SCs and cellulose. Commercially-available wind-separation equipment successfully prepared a culm-rich fraction with a SC recovery of 83.1% (w/w) from rice straw flakes (54.1% of total weight of rice straw). The fraction was suspended in water (20%, w/w) for starch liquefaction, and the suspension was subjected to a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with yeast, yielding 5.6% (w/v) ethanol (86% of the theoretical yield from whole hexoses in the fraction) after 24h fermentation. Thus, the DiSC process produced highly-concentrated ethanol from rice straw in a one vat process without any harsh thermo-chemical pretreatments.
21140152	Estrogen-inducible GFP expression patterns in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	Plant Cell Rep	We investigated estrogen-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression patterns using an estrogen receptor fused chimeric transcription activator, XVE, in the monocotyledonous model plant rice (Oryza sativa L.). This system has been shown to be an effective chemical-inducible gene expression system in Arabidopsis and has been applied to other plants in order to investigate gene functions or produce marker-free transgenic plants. However, limited information is available on the correlation between inducer concentration and the expression level of the gene induced in monocots. Here, we produced a transgenic rice integrated estrogen-inducible GFP expression vector, pLex:GFP, and investigated dose-response and time-course patterns of GFP induction in rice calli and seedlings for the first time. With 17-β-estradiol treatment at >5 μM, GFP signals were detected in the entire surface of calli within 2 days of culture. Highest GFP signals were extended for 8 days with estradiol treatment at 25 μM. In three-leaf-stage seedlings, GFP signals in the leaves of pLex:GFP-integrated transgenic lines were weaker than those in the leaves of p35S:GFP-integrated transgenic lines. However, GFP signals in the roots of pLex:GFP- and p35S:GFP-integrated transgenic lines were similar with estradiol treatment at >10 μM. With regard to controlling appropriate gene expression, these results might provide helpful indications on estradiol treatment conditions to be used for the XVE system in rice and other monocots.
21267709	Combining genetical genomics and bulked segregant analysis-based differential expression: an approach to gene localization.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Positional gene isolation in unsequenced species generally requires either a reference genome sequence or an inference of gene content based on conservation of synteny with a genomic model. In the large unsequenced genomes of the Triticeae cereals the latter, i.e. conservation of synteny with the rice and Brachypodium genomes, provides a powerful proxy for establishing local gene content and order. However, efficient exploitation of conservation of synteny requires 'homology bridges' between the model genome and the target region that contains a gene of interest. As effective homology bridges are generally the sequences of genetically mapped genes, increasing the density of these genes around a target locus is an important step in the process. We used bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of transcript abundance data to identify genes located in a specific region of the barley genome. The approach is valuable because only a relatively small proportion of barley genes are currently placed on a genetic map. We analyzed eQTL datasets from the reference Steptoe × Morex doubled haploid population and showed a strong association between differential gene expression and cis-regulation, with 83% of differentially expressed genes co-locating with their eQTL. We then performed BSA by assembling allele-specific pools based on the genotypes of individuals at the partial resistance QTL Rphq11. BSA identified a total of 411 genes as differentially expressed, including HvPHGPx, a gene previously identified as a promising candidate for Rphq11. The genetic location of 276 of these genes could be determined from both eQTL datasets and conservation of synteny, and 254 (92%) of these were located on the target chromosome. We conclude that the identification of differential expression by BSA constitutes a novel method to identify genes located in specific regions of interest. The datasets obtained from such studies provide a robust set of candidate genes for the analysis and serve as valuable resources for targeted marker development and comparative mapping with other grass species.
21694767	Global profiling of rice and poplar transcriptomes highlights key conserved circadian-controlled pathways and cis-regulatory modules.	2011	PLoS One	BACKGROUND: Circadian clocks provide an adaptive advantage through anticipation of daily and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, the central clock oscillator is regulated by several interlocking feedback loops. It was shown that a substantial proportion of the Arabidopsis genome cycles with phases of peak expression covering the entire day. Synchronized transcriptome cycling is driven through an extensive network of diurnal and clock-regulated transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory elements. Study of the cycling transcriptome in other plant species could thus help elucidate the similarities and differences and identify hubs of regulation common to monocot and dicot plants.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a combination of oligonucleotide microarrays and data mining pipelines, we examined daily rhythms in gene expression in one monocotyledonous and one dicotyledonous plant, rice and poplar, respectively. Cycling transcriptomes were interrogated under different diurnal (driven) and circadian (free running) light and temperature conditions. Collectively, photocycles and thermocycles regulated about 60% of the expressed nuclear genes in rice and poplar. Depending on the condition tested, up to one third of oscillating Arabidopsis-poplar-rice orthologs were phased within three hours of each other suggesting a high degree of conservation in terms of rhythmic gene expression. We identified clusters of rhythmically co-expressed genes and searched their promoter sequences to identify phase-specific cis-elements, including elements that were conserved in the promoters of Arabidopsis, poplar, and rice.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that the cycling patterns of many circadian clock genes are highly conserved across poplar, rice, and Arabidopsis. The expression of many orthologous genes in key metabolic and regulatory pathways is diurnal and/or circadian regulated and phased to similar times of day. Our results confirm previous findings in Arabidopsis of three major classes of cis-regulatory modules within the plant circadian network: the morning (ME, GBOX), evening (EE, GATA), and midnight (PBX/TBX/SBX) modules. Identification of identical overrepresented motifs in the promoters of cycling genes from different species suggests that the core diurnal/circadian cis-regulatory network is deeply conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous species.
21635781	Diverse and tissue-enriched small RNAs in the plant pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.	2011	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Emerging knowledge of the impact of small RNAs as important cellular regulators has prompted an explosion of small transcriptome sequencing projects. Although significant progress has been made towards small RNA discovery and biogenesis in higher eukaryotes and other model organisms, knowledge in simple eukaryotes such as filamentous fungi remains limited.

RESULTS: Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing to present a detailed analysis of the small RNA transcriptome (~ 15 - 40 nucleotides in length) from mycelia and appressoria tissues of the rice blast fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. Small RNAs mapped to numerous nuclear and mitochondrial genomic features including repetitive elements, tRNA loci, rRNAs, protein coding genes, snRNAs and intergenic regions. For most elements, small RNAs mapped primarily to the sense strand with the exception of repetitive elements to which small RNAs mapped in the sense and antisense orientation in near equal proportions. Inspection of the small RNAs revealed a preference for U and suppression of C at position 1, particularly for antisense mapping small RNAs. In the mycelia library, small RNAs of the size 18 - 23 nt were enriched for intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Small RNAs mapping to LTR retrotransposons were classified as LTR retrotransposon-siRNAs (LTR-siRNAs). Conversely, the appressoria library had a greater proportion of 28 - 35 nt small RNAs mapping to tRNA loci, and were classified as tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs). LTR-siRNAs and tRFs were independently validated by 3' RACE PCR and northern blots, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest M. oryzae small RNAs differentially accumulate in vegetative and specialized-infection tissues and may play an active role in genome integrity and regulating growth and development.
21323774	Distinct evolutionary patterns of Oryza glaberrima deciphered by genome sequencing and comparative analysis.	2011	Plant J	Here we present the genomic sequence of the African cultivated rice, Oryza glaberrima, and compare these data with the genome sequence of Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. We obtained gene-enriched sequences of O. glaberrima that correspond to about 25% of the gene regions of the O. sativa (japonica) genome by methylation filtration and subtractive hybridization of repetitive sequences. While patterns of amino acid changes did not differ between the two species in terms of the biochemical properties, genes of O. glaberrima generally showed a larger synonymous-nonsynonymous substitution ratio, suggesting that O. glaberrima has undergone a genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection. We further investigated nucleotide substitutions around splice sites and found that eight genes of O. sativa experienced changes at splice sites after the divergence from O. glaberrima. These changes produced novel introns that partially truncated functional domains, suggesting that these newly emerged introns affect gene function. We also identified 2451 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from the genomes of O. glaberrima and O. sativa. Although tri-nucleotide repeats were most common among the SSRs and were overrepresented in the protein-coding sequences, we found that selection against indels of tri-nucleotide repeats was relatively weak in both African and Asian rice. Our genome-wide sequencing of O. glaberrima and in-depth analyses provide rice researchers not only with useful genomic resources for future breeding but also with new insights into the genomic evolution of the African and Asian rice species.
22319137	Independent domestication of Asian rice followed by gene flow from japonica to indica.	2012	Mol Biol Evol	Results from studies on the domestication process of Asian rice Oryza sativa have been controversial because of its complicated evolutionary history. Previous studies have yielded two alternative hypotheses about the origin(s) of the two major groups of O. sativa: japonica and indica. One study proposes a single common wild ancestor, whereas the other suggests that there were multiple domestication events of different types of wild rice. Here, we provide clear evidence of the independent domestication of japonica and indica obtained via high-throughput sequencing and a large-scale comparative analysis of two wild rice accessions (W1943 and W0106) and two cultivars (a japonica cultivar called "Nipponbare" and an indica cultivar called "Guangluai-4"). The different domestication processes of the two cultivar groups appear to have led to distinct patterns of molecular evolution in protein-coding regions. The intensity of purifying selection was relaxed only in the japonica group, possibly because of a bottleneck effect. Moreover, a genome-wide comparison between Nipponbare, Guangluai-4, and another indica cultivar (93-11) suggests multiple hybridization events between japonica and indica, both before and after the divergence of the indica cultivars. We found that a large amount of genomic DNA, including domestication-related genes, was transferred from japonica to indica, which might have been important in the development of modern rice. Our study provides an overview of the dynamic process of Asian rice domestication, including independent domestication events and subsequent gene flow.
21465186	Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) EST and SSR marker development, annotation, and transferability.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Orchardgrass, or cocksfoot [Dactylis glomerata (L.)], has been naturalized on nearly every continent and is a commonly used species for forage and hay production. All major cultivated varieties of orchardgrass are autotetraploid, and few tools or information are available for functional and comparative genetic analyses and improvement of the species. To improve the genetic resources for orchardgrass, we have developed an EST library and SSR markers from salt, drought, and cold stressed tissues. The ESTs were bi-directionally sequenced from clones and combined into 17,373 unigenes. Unigenes were annotated based on putative orthology to genes from rice, Triticeae grasses, other Poaceae, Arabidopsis, and the non-redundant database of the NCBI. Of 1,162 SSR markers developed, approximately 80% showed amplification products across a set of orchardgrass germplasm, and 40% across related Festuca and Lolium species. When orchardgrass subspecies were genotyped using 33 SSR markers their within-accession similarity values ranged from 0.44 to 0.71, with Mediterranean accessions having a higher similarity. The total number of genotyped bands was greater for tetraploid accessions compared to diploid accessions. Clustering analysis indicated grouping of Mediterranean subspecies and central Asian subspecies, while the D. glomerata ssp. aschersoniana was closest related to three cultivated varieties.
21621873	The study of the E-class SEPALLATA3-like MADS-box genes in wild-type and mutant flowers of cultivated saffron crocus (Crocus sativus L.) and its putative progenitors.	2011	J Plant Physiol	To further understand flowering and flower organ formation in the monocot crop saffron crocus (Crocus sativus L.), we cloned four MIKC(c) type II MADS-box cDNA sequences of the E-class SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) subfamily designated CsatSEP3a/b/c/c_as as well as the three respective genomic sequences. Sequence analysis showed that cDNA sequences of CsatSEP3 c and c_as are the products of alternative splicing of the CsatSEP3c gene. Bioinformatics analysis with putative orthologous sequences from various plant species suggested that all four cDNA sequences encode for SEP3-like proteins with characteristic motifs and amino acids, and highlighted intriguing sequence features. Phylogenetically, the isolated sequences were closest to the SEP3-like genes from monocots such as Asparagus virgatus, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, and the dicot Arabidopsis SEP3 gene. All four isolated C. sativus sequences were strongly expressed in flowers and in all flower organs: whorl1 tepals, whorl2 tepals, stamens and carpels, but not in leaves. Expression of CsatSEP3a/b/c/c_as cDNAs was compared in wild-type and mutant flowers. Expression of the isolatedCsatSEP3-like genes in whorl1 tepals together with E-class CsatAP1/FUL subfamily and B-class CsatAP3 and CsatPI subfamilies of genes, fits the ABCE "quartet model," an extended form of the original ABC model proposed to explain the homeotic transformation of whorl1 sepals into whorl1 tepals in Liliales and Asparagales plants such as C. sativus. This conclusion was also supported by the interaction of the CsatSEP3b protein with CsatAP1/FUL and CsatAP3 proteins. In contrast, expression of both B-class CsatAP3 and CsatPI genes and the C-class CsatAGAMOUS genes together with E-class CsatSEP3-like genes in carpels, without any phenotypic effects on carpels, raises questions about the role of these gene classes in carpel formation in this non-grass monocot and requires further experimentation. Finally, taking advantage of the size and sequence differences in amplified genomic sequences of the triploid C. sativus and comparing them with the respective sequences from C. tomasii, C. hadriaticus and C. cartwrightianus, three putative wild-type diploid progenitor species, we examined the origin of CsatSEP3a sequence.
21606319	Gene coexpression network alignment and conservation of gene modules between two grass species: maize and rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	One major objective for plant biology is the discovery of molecular subsystems underlying complex traits. The use of genetic and genomic resources combined in a systems genetics approach offers a means for approaching this goal. This study describes a maize (Zea mays) gene coexpression network built from publicly available expression arrays. The maize network consisted of 2,071 loci that were divided into 34 distinct modules that contained 1,928 enriched functional annotation terms and 35 cofunctional gene clusters. Of note, 391 maize genes of unknown function were found to be coexpressed within modules along with genes of known function. A global network alignment was made between this maize network and a previously described rice (Oryza sativa) coexpression network. The IsoRankN tool was used, which incorporates both gene homology and network topology for the alignment. A total of 1,173 aligned loci were detected between the two grass networks, which condensed into 154 conserved subgraphs that preserved 4,758 coexpression edges in rice and 6,105 coexpression edges in maize. This study provides an early view into maize coexpression space and provides an initial network-based framework for the translation of functional genomic and genetic information between these two vital agricultural species.
21216747	Rice TOGO Browser: A platform to retrieve integrated information on rice functional and applied genomics.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	The Rice TOGO Browser is an online public resource designed to facilitate integration and visualization of mapping data of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)/P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones, genes, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)/simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and phenotype data represented as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) onto the genome sequence, and to provide a platform for more efficient utilization of genome information from the point of view of applied genomics as well as functional genomics. Three search options, namely keyword search, region search and trait search, generate various types of data in a user-friendly interface with three distinct viewers, a chromosome viewer, an integrated map viewer and a sequence viewer, thereby providing the opportunity to view the position of genes and/or QTLs at the chromosomal level and to retrieve any sequence information in a user-defined genome region. Furthermore, the gene list, marker list and genome sequence in a specified region delineated by RFLP/SSR markers and any sequences designed as primers can be viewed and downloaded to support forward genetics approaches. An additional feature of this database is the graphical viewer for BLAST search to reveal information not only for regions with significant sequence similarity but also for regions adjacent to those with similarity but with no hits between sequences. An easy to use and intuitive user interface can help a wide range of users in retrieving integrated mapping information including agronomically important traits on the rice genome sequence. The database can be accessed at http://agri-trait.dna.affrc.go.jp/.
21665325	Heritable alteration in DNA methylation induced by nitrogen-deficiency stress accompanies enhanced tolerance by progenies to the stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2011	J Plant Physiol	Cytosine methylation is responsive to various biotic- and abiotic-stresses, which may produce heritable epialleles. Nitrogen (N)-deficiency is an abiotic stress being repeatedly experienced by plants. To address possible epigenetic consequences of N-deficiency-stress, we investigated the stability of cytosine methylation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) subsequent to a chronic (a whole-generation) N-deficiency at two levels, moderate (20mg/L) and severe (10mg/L), under hydroponic culture. MSAP analysis revealed that locus-specific methylation alteration occurred in leaf-tissue of the stressed plants (S(0)) experiencing either level of N-deficiency, which was validated by gel-blotting. Analysis on three non-stressed self-fed progenies (S(1), S(2) and S(3)) by gel-blotting indicated that ca. 50% of the altered methylation patterns in somatic cells (leaf) of the stressed S(0) plants were recaptured in S(1), which were then stably inherited to S(2) and S(3). Bisulfite sequencing of two variant MSAP loci with homology to low-copy retrotransposons on one stressed plant (S(0)) and its non-stressed progenies (S(1) and S(2)) showed that whereas one locus exhibited limited and non-heritable CHH methylation alteration, the other locus manifested dramatic heritable hypermethylation at nearly all cytosine sites within the assayed region. Intriguingly, when two groups of S(2) plants descended from the same N-deficiency-stressed S(0) plant were re-subjected to the stress, the group inheriting the modified methylation patterns showed enhanced tolerance to the N-deficiency-stress compared with the group bearing the original patterns. Our results thus demonstrate heritability of an acquired adaptive trait in rice, which was accompanied by epigenetic inheritance of modified cytosine methylation patterns, implicating an epigenetic basis underlying the inheritance of an acquired trait in plants.
21353327	Net sodium fluxes change significantly at anatomically distinct root zones of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings.	2011	J Plant Physiol	Casparian bands of endodermis and exodermis play crucial roles in blocking apoplastic movement of ions and water into the stele of roots through the cortex. These apoplastic barriers differ considerably in structure and function along the developing root. The present study assessed net Na+ fluxes in anatomically distinct root zones of rice seedlings and analyzed parts of individual roots showing different Na+ uptake. The results indicated that anatomically distinct root zones contributed differently to the overall uptake of Na+. The average Na+ uptake in root zones in which Casparian bands of the endo- and exo-dermis were interrupted by initiating lateral root primordia (root zone III) was significantly greater than that at the root apex, where Casparian bands were not yet formed (root zone I), or in the region where endo- and exo-dermis with Casparian bands were well developed (root zone II). The measurement of net Na+ fluxes using a non-invasive scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) demonstrated that net Na+ flux varied significantly in different positions along developing rice roots, and a net Na+ influx was obvious at the base of young lateral root primordia. Since sodium fluxes changed significantly along developing roots of rice seedlings, we suggest that the significantly distinct net Na+ flux profile may be attributed to different apoplastic permeability due to lateral root primordia development for non-selective apoplastic bypass of ions along the apoplast.
21571672	Comparative network analysis reveals that tissue specificity and gene function are important factors influencing the mode of expression evolution in Arabidopsis and rice.	2011	Plant Physiol	Microarray experiments have yielded massive amounts of expression information measured under various conditions for the model species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Expression compendia grouping multiple experiments make it possible to define correlated gene expression patterns within one species and to study how expression has evolved between species. We developed a robust framework to measure expression context conservation (ECC) and found, by analyzing 4,630 pairs of orthologous Arabidopsis and rice genes, that 77% showed conserved coexpression. Examples of nonconserved ECC categories suggested a link between regulatory evolution and environmental adaptations and included genes involved in signal transduction, response to different abiotic stresses, and hormone stimuli. To identify genomic features that influence expression evolution, we analyzed the relationship between ECC, tissue specificity, and protein evolution. Tissue-specific genes showed higher expression conservation compared with broadly expressed genes but were fast evolving at the protein level. No significant correlation was found between protein and expression evolution, implying that both modes of gene evolution are not strongly coupled in plants. By integration of cis-regulatory elements, many ECC conserved genes were significantly enriched for shared DNA motifs, hinting at the conservation of ancestral regulatory interactions in both model species. Surprisingly, for several tissue-specific genes, patterns of concerted network evolution were observed, unveiling conserved coexpression in the absence of conservation of tissue specificity. These findings demonstrate that orthologs inferred through sequence similarity in many cases do not share similar biological functions and highlight the importance of incorporating expression information when comparing genes across species.
20857082	Mapping QTL main and interaction influences on milling quality in elite US rice germplasm.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) head-rice yield (HR) is a key export and domestic quality trait whose genetic control is poorly understood. With the goal of identifying genomic regions influencing HR, quantitative-trait-locus (QTL) mapping was carried out for quality-related traits in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from crosses of common parent Cypress, a high-HR US japonica cultivar, with RT0034, a low-HR indica line (129 RILs) and LaGrue, a low-HR japonica cultivar (298 RILs), grown in two US locations in 2005-2007. Early heading increased HR in the Louisiana (LA) but not the Arkansas (AR) location. Fitting QTL-mapping models to separate QTL main and QTL × environment interaction (QEI) effects and identify epistatic interactions revealed six main-effect HR QTLs in the two crosses, at four of which Cypress contributed the increasing allele. Multi-QTL models accounted for 0.36 of genetic and 0.21 of genetic × environment interaction of HR in MY1, and corresponding proportions of 0.25 and 0.37 in MY2. The greater HR advantage of Cypress in LA than in AR corresponded to a genomewide pattern of opposition of HR-increasing QTL effects by AR-specific effects, suggesting a selection strategy for improving this cultivar for AR. Treating year-location combinations as independent environments resulted in underestimation of QEI effects, evidently owing to lower variation among years within location than between location. Identification of robust HR QTLs in elite long-grain germplasm is suggested to require more detailed attention to the interaction of plant and grain development parameters with environmental conditions than has been given to date.
24178570	Isolation and bioinformatic analyses of small RNAs interacting with germ cell-specific argonaute in rice.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	The small noncoding RNAs in plants are categorized into two major classes, 21-nucleotides (nt) micro RNA (miRNA) and 21- or 24-nt small-interfering RNA (siRNA). ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins associate with small RNAs and play central roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation. In plants, AGO1-miRNA complexes mainly regulate developmental processes, and AGO4-siRNA complexes suppress the activity of transposons and exogenous viral infections via RNA-directed DNA methylation. In many animal species, the PIWI-subfamily AGOs interact with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are most commonly 24-34 nt, and function to tame transposons and to regulate mRNA translation and stability in the germline. The rice protein MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1) is a plant AGO member that has roles specific to development and maintenance of germ cells before meiosis. MEL1-binding small RNAs are mainly 21 nt, have a 5'-terminal cytosine, and are distinct from animal piRNAs. In this chapter, we describe methods for RNA-immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) using a specific antibody that recognizes MEL1 and subsequent purification of MEL1-associating small RNAs from the IP fraction. We also introduce the bioinformatic procedures including mapping, annotation, and identifying small RNA clusters on the rice genome.
24570855	An optical interferometric technique for assessing ozone induced damage and recovery under cumulative exposures for a Japanese rice cultivar.	2014	Springerplus	Exposure to ozone (O3) causes reduction both in the growth and yield of rice (Oriza sativa L.). Commonly used Chlorophyll fluorescent measurements are not sensitive enough for short term exposure of O3 aiming an immediate assessments. Such a conventional method typically needs exposure over a few days to detect the influence. As an alternative method, we proposed a novel non-invasive, robust, real-time, optical Statistical Interferometric Technique (SIT) to measure growth at an accuracy of 0.1 nm with a commonly consumed Japanese rice cultivar, Koshihikari. In the present study, we have conducted a repetitive O3 exposure experiment for three days under three different concentrations of 0 nl l(-1) (control), 120 nl l(-1), and 240 nl l(-1), to investigate the damage and recovery strengths. As a measure to assess the effect and recovery from three consecutive day exposures of O3, we measured the elongation rate (nm mm(-1) sec(-1)) every 5.5 sec for 7 hours, and it revealed nanometric elongation rate fluctuations or Nanometric Intrinsic Fluctuations (NIF). Comparing the standard deviation (SD) of normalized nanometric intrinsic fluctuations (NNIF), which was normalized by that before the exposure, we found that drastic reductions under both 120 nl l(-1) and 240 nl l(-1) O3 concentrations. Reduction percentages were large under high O3 concentration of 240 nl l(-1) indicating the possibility of irreversible effect. However exposure to 120 nl l(-1) of O3 showed recovery on the 2(nd) and 3(rd) days. While SIT did reveal immediate effect based on an observation for a few hours, the visible foliar effect could be observed only after a week. Hence, the technique could provide a way for fast assessment of effect and recovery due to cumulative exposure of O3 and hence the tolerance as well as the vitality of plant.
24586255	New approach to increasing rice lodging resistance and biomass yield through the use of high gibberellin producing varieties.	2014	PLoS One	Traditional breeding for high-yielding rice has been dependent on the widespread use of fertilizers and the cultivation of gibberellin (GA)-deficient semi-dwarf varieties. The use of semi-dwarf plants facilitates high grain yield since these varieties possess high levels of lodging resistance, and thus could support the high grain weight. Although this approach has been successful in increasing grain yield, it is desirable to further improve grain production and also to breed for high biomass. In this study, we re-examined the effect of GA on rice lodging resistance and biomass yield using several GA-deficient mutants (e.g. having defects in the biosynthesis or perception of GA), and high-GA producing line or mutant. GA-deficient mutants displayed improved bending-type lodging resistance due to their short stature; however they showed reduced breaking-type lodging resistance and reduced total biomass. In plants producing high amounts of GA, the bending-type lodging resistance was inferior to the original cultivars. The breaking-type lodging resistance was improved due to increased lignin accumulation and/or larger culm diameters. Further, these lines had an increase in total biomass weight. These results show that the use of rice cultivars producing high levels of GA would be a novel approach to create higher lodging resistance and biomass.
24454308	Transgenic strategies to confer resistance against viruses in rice plants.	2014	Front Microbiol	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is cultivated in more than 100 countries and supports nearly half of the world's population. Developing efficient methods to control rice viruses is thus an urgent necessity because viruses cause serious losses in rice yield. Most rice viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, notably planthoppers and leafhoppers. Viruliferous insect vectors can disperse their viruses over relatively long distances, and eradication of the viruses is very difficult once they become widespread. Exploitation of natural genetic sources of resistance is one of the most effective approaches to protect crops from virus infection; however, only a few naturally occurring rice genes confer resistance against rice viruses. Many investigators are using genetic engineering of rice plants as a potential strategy to control viral diseases. Using viral genes to confer pathogen-derived resistance against crops is a well-established procedure, and the expression of various viral gene products has proved to be effective in preventing or reducing infection by various plant viruses since the 1990s. RNA interference (RNAi), also known as RNA silencing, is one of the most efficient methods to confer resistance against plant viruses on their respective crops. In this article, we review the recent progress, mainly conducted by our research group, in transgenic strategies to confer resistance against tenuiviruses and reoviruses in rice plants. Our findings also illustrate that not all RNAi constructs against viral RNAs are equally effective in preventing virus infection and that it is important to identify the viral "Achilles' heel" gene to target for RNAi attack when engineering plants.
24635777	Rice germline-specific Argonaute MEL1 protein binds to phasiRNAs generated from more than 700 lincRNAs.	2014	Plant J	Small RNAs that interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins play central roles in RNA-mediated silencing. MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1), a rice AGO, has specific functions in the development of pre-meiotic germ cells and the progression of meiosis. Here, we show that MEL1, which is located mostly in the cytoplasm of germ cells, associates preferentially with 21-nucleotide phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) that bear a 5'-terminal cytosine. Most phasiRNAs are derived from 1171 intergenic clusters distributed on all rice chromosomes. From these clusters, over 700 large intergenic, non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that contain the consensus sequence complementary to miR2118 are transcribed specifically in inflorescences, and cleaved within the miR2118 site. Cleaved lincRNAs are processed via DICER-LIKE4 (DCL4) protein, resulting in production of phasiRNAs. This study provides the evidence that the miR2118-dependent and the DCL4-dependent pathways are both required for biogenesis of 21-nt phasiRNAs associated with germline-specific MEL1 AGO in rice, and over 700 lincRNAs are key factors for induction of this biogenesis during reproductive-specific stages.
24709155	Isolation of jasmonate-induced sesquiterpene synthase of rice: product of which has an antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	J Plant Physiol	Rice is one of the most important crops worldwide, and it is a model for molecular studies of monocotyledonous species, particularly for understanding the molecular mechanisms of plant disease resistance. Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important plant hormone involved in rice-pathogen interactions. In addition, JA-induced volatiles are known to be involved in the rice defense system regulated by JA signaling. In this study, we isolated a JA-induced terpene synthase from rice, and found that it produces two sesquiterpenes; β-elemene and β-bisabolene. Furthermore, β-elemene exhibited significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae; however it did not exhibited any antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. JA-induced accumulation of β-elemene was regulated by OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein that is involved in the JA signaling pathway, suggesting that β-elemene plays an important role in JA-induced resistance, and that it functions as an antifungal compound in rice.
24569847	Reduction of gibberellin by low temperature disrupts pollen development in rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	Microsporogenesis in rice (Oryza sativa) plants is susceptible to moderate low temperature (LT; approximately 19°C) that disrupts pollen development and causes severe reductions in grain yields. Although considerable research has been invested in the study of cool-temperature injury, a full understanding of the molecular mechanism has not been achieved. Here, we show that endogenous levels of the bioactive gibberellins (GAs) GA4 and GA7, and expression levels of the GA biosynthesis genes GA20ox3 and GA3ox1, decrease in the developing anthers by exposure to LT. By contrast, the levels of precursor GA12 were higher in response to LT. In addition, the expression of the dehydration-responsive element-binding protein DREB2B and SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1)/DELLA was up-regulated in response to LT. Mutants involved in GA biosynthetic and response pathways were hypersensitive to LT stress, including the semidwarf mutants sd1 and d35, the gain-of-function mutant slr1-d, and gibberellin insensitive dwarf1. The reduction in the number of sporogenous cells and the abnormal enlargement of tapetal cells occurred most severely in the GA-insensitive mutant. Application of exogenous GA significantly reversed the male sterility caused by LT, and simultaneous application of exogenous GA with sucrose substantially improved the extent of normal pollen development. Modern rice varieties carrying the sd1 mutation are widely cultivated, and the sd1 mutation is considered one of the greatest achievements of the Green Revolution. The protective strategy achieved by our work may help sustain steady yields of rice under global climate change.
24649396	Identification of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) as a β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitory molecule in rice grain extract and digest.	2014	FEBS Open Bio	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely considered to be caused by amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. Aβ is excised from amyloid-β precursor protein through sequential cleavage by β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Thus, BACE1 inhibition could prevent Aβ accumulation. Here, we identified myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) as a BACE1 inhibitory molecule in rice grain extract and digest. The rice digest and IP6 significantly inhibited Aβ production in neuroblastoma cells without cytotoxicity. These results suggested that rice components, including IP6, may be promising starting materials for the development of potent and safe drugs and/or food to prevent AD.
24466017	Genome-wide DNA polymorphisms in seven rice cultivars of temperate and tropical japonica groups.	2014	PLoS One	Elucidation of the rice genome is expected to broaden our understanding of genes related to the agronomic characteristics and the genetic relationship among cultivars. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencings of 6 cultivars, including 5 temperate japonica cultivars and 1 tropical japonica cultivar (Moroberekan), by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with Nipponbare genome as a reference. The temperate japonica cultivars contained 2 sake brewing (Yamadanishiki and Gohyakumangoku), 1 landrace (Kameji), and 2 modern cultivars (Koshihikari and Norin 8). Almost >83% of the whole genome sequences of the Nipponbare genome could be covered by sequenced short-reads of each cultivar, including Omachi, which has previously been reported to be a temperate japonica cultivar. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions were detected among the various cultivars and the Nipponbare genomes. Comparison of SNPs detected in each cultivar suggested that Moroberekan had 5-fold more SNPs than the temperate japonica cultivars. Success of the 2 approaches to improve the efficacy of sequence data by using NGS revealed that sequencing depth was directly related to sequencing coverage of coding DNA sequences: in excess of 30× genome sequencing was required to cover approximately 80% of the genes in the rice genome. Further, the contigs prepared using the assembly of unmapped reads could increase the value of NGS short-reads and, consequently, cover previously unavailable sequences. These approaches facilitated the identification of new genes in coding DNA sequences and the increase of mapping efficiency in different regions. The DNA polymorphism information between the 7 cultivars and Nipponbare are available at NGRC_Rices_Build1.0 (http://www.nodai-genome.org/oryza_sativa_en.html).
24406628	Sites of action of elevated CO2 on leaf development in rice: discrimination between the effects of elevated CO2 and nitrogen deficiency.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Elevated CO2 concentrations (eCO2) trigger various plant responses. Despite intensive studies of these responses, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this work, we investigated when and how leaf physiology and anatomy are affected by eCO2 in rice plants. We analyzed the most recently fully expanded leaves that developed successively after transfer of the plant to eCO2. To discriminate between the effects of eCO2 and those of nitrogen deficiency, we used three different levels of N application. We found that a decline in the leaf soluble protein content (on a leaf area basis) at eCO2 was only observed under N deficiency. The length and width of the leaf blade were reduced by both eCO2 and N deficiency, whereas the blade thickness was increased by eCO2 but was not affected by N deficiency. The change in length by eCO2 became detectable in the secondly fully expanded leaf, and those in width and thickness in the thirdly fully expanded leaf, which were at the leaf developmental stages P4 and P3, respectively, at the onset of the eCO2 treatment. The decreased blade length at eCO2 was associated with a decrease in the epidermal cell number on the adaxial side and a reduction in cell length on the abaxial side. The decreased width resulted from decreased numbers of small vascular bundles and epidermal cell files. The increased thickness was ascribed mainly to enhanced development of bundle sheath extensions at the ridges of vascular bundles. These observations enable us to identify the sites of action of eCO2 on rice leaf development.
24654769	OsNIP3;1, a rice boric acid channel, regulates boron distribution and is essential for growth under boron-deficient conditions.	2014	Plant J	Boron is an essential micronutrient for higher plants. Boron deficiency is an important agricultural issue because it results in loss of yield quality and/or quantity in cereals and other crops. To understand boron transport mechanisms in cereals, we characterized OsNIP3;1, a member of the major intrinsic protein family in rice (Oryza sativa L.), because OsNIP3;1 is the most similar rice gene to the Arabidopsis thaliana boric acid channel genes AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1. Yeast cells expressing OsNIP3;1 imported more boric acid than control cells. GFP-tagged OsNIP3;1 expressed in tobacco BY2 cells was localized to the plasma membrane. The accumulation of OsNIP3;1 transcript increased fivefold in roots within 6 h of the onset of boron starvation, but not in shoots. Promoter-GUS analysis suggested that OsNIP3;1 is expressed mainly in exodermal cells and steles in roots, as well as in cells around the vascular bundles in leaf sheaths and pericycle cells around the xylem in leaf blades. The growth of OsNIP3;1 RNAi plants was impaired under boron limitation. These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 functions as a boric acid channel, and is required for acclimation to boron limitation. Boron distribution among shoot tissues was altered in OsNIP3;1 knockdown plants, especially under boron-deficient conditions. This result demonstrates that OsNIP3;1 regulates boron distribution among shoot tissues, and that the correct boron distribution is crucial for plant growth.
24535433	The MET1b gene encoding a maintenance DNA methyltransferase is indispensable for normal development in rice.	2014	Plant Mol Biol	While Arabidopsis bears only one MET1 gene encoding the DNA methyltransferase that is mainly responsible for maintaining CG methylation after DNA replication, rice carries two MET1 genes, MET1a and MET1b, expressed in actively replicating and dividing cells, and MET1b is more abundantly expressed than is MET1a. A met1a null mutant displayed no overt phenotypes, implying that MET1b must play a major role in the maintenance DNA methylation. Here, we employed two met1b null mutants, generated by homologous recombination-mediated knock-in targeting and insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17. These MET1a/MET1a met1b/met1b homozygotes exhibited abnormal seed phenotypes, which is associated with either viviparous germination or early embryonic lethality. They also displayed decreased levels of DNA methylation at repetitive CentO sequences and at the FIE1 gene locus in the embryos. In addition, independently isolated knock-in-targeted plants, in which the promoterless GUS reporter gene was fused with the endogenous MET1b promoter, showed the reproducible, dosage-dependent, and spatiotemporal expression patterns of GUS. The genotyping analysis of selfed progeny of heterozygous met1a met1b null mutants indicated that weakly active MET1a seems to serve as a genetic backup mechanism in rice met1b gametophytes, although the stochastic and uncoordinated activation of epigenetic backup mechanisms occurred less efficiently in the met1b homozygotes of rice than in the met1 homozygotes of Arabidopsis. Moreover, passive depletion of CG methylation during the postmeiotic DNA replication in the haploid nuclei of the met1a met1b gametophytes in rice results in early embryonic lethality. This situation somewhat resembles that of the met1 gametophytes in Arabidopsis.
24243191	DNA extraction from rice endosperm (including a protocol for extraction of DNA from ancient seed samples).	2014	Methods Mol Biol	Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from endosperm can be effectively used for rapid genotyping using seed tissue, to evaluate seed quality from packaged grains and to determine the purity of milled grains. Methods outlined here are optimal procedures to isolate DNA from endosperm tissue of modern rice grains and of aged rice remains preserved between 50 and 100 years. The extracted DNA can be used to amplify regions of chloroplast genomic DNA (ctDNA), mitochondrial genomic DNA (mtDNA), and nuclear genomic DNA using standard PCR protocols. In addition, we describe an optimal procedure to process archaeological grain specimens, aged for a couple of thousand years, to isolate DNA from these ancient samples, referred to here as ancient DNA (aDNA). The aDNA can be successfully amplified by PCR using appropriate primer pairs designed specifically for aDNA amplification.
24410502	Differential analysis of protein expression in RNA-binding-protein transgenic and parental rice seeds cultivated under salt stress.	2014	J Proteome Res	Transgenic plants tolerant to various environmental stresses are being developed to ensure a consistent food supply. We used a transgenic rice cultivar with high saline tolerance by introducing an RNA-binding protein (RBP) from the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum); differences in salt-soluble protein expression between nontransgenic (NT) and RBP rice seeds were analyzed by 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a gel-based proteomic method. To identify RBP-related changes in protein expression under salt stress, NT and RBP rice were cultured with or without 200 mM sodium chloride. Only two protein spots differed between NT and RBP rice seeds cultured under normal conditions, one of which was identified as a putative abscisic acid-induced protein. In NT rice seeds, 91 spots significantly differed between normal and salt-stress conditions. Two allergenic proteins of NT rice seeds, RAG1 and RAG2, were induced by high salt. In contrast, RBP rice seeds yielded seven spots and no allergen spots with significant differences in protein expression between normal and salt-stress conditions. Therefore, expression of fewer proteins was altered in RBP rice seeds by high salt than those in NT rice seeds.
24506679	Biochemical and molecular characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots forming a barrier to radial oxygen loss.	2014	Plant Cell Environ	The formation of a barrier to radial oxygen (O2 ) loss (ROL) in the root is an important adaptation of plants to root flooding, but the biochemical changes in plant roots where the barrier is formed are unclear. In this study, we analysed metabolic profiles and gene expression profiles in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants grown under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, which induce suberization in the outer cell layers of the roots and formation of barrier to ROL. Under these conditions, two distinctive biochemical features of the roots were the accumulations of malic acid and very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). We also showed that the expressions of some genes encoding plastid-localized enzymes, which convert malic acid to acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), were simultaneously up-regulated under stagnant conditions. The expression levels of these genes in specific root tissues isolated by laser microdissection suggested that malic acid is converted to AcCoA predominantly in the plastids in the outer cell layers of rice roots. We propose that the physiological role of malic acid accumulation in rice roots grown under stagnant conditions is to provide a substrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, which, in turn, are used in the biosynthesis of suberin.
24591053	Introgression of two chromosome regions for leaf photosynthesis from an indica rice into the genetic background of a japonica rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	Increases in rates of individual leaf photosynthesis (P n) are critical for future increases of rice yields. A previous study, using introgression lines derived from a cross between indica cultivar Habataki, with one of the highest recorded values of P n, and the Japanese elite cultivar Koshihikari, identified four QTLs (qCAR4, qCAR5, qCAR8, and qCAR11) that affect P n. The present study examined the combined effect of qCAR4 and qCAR8 on P n in the genetic background of Koshihikari. The pyramided near-isogenic line NIL(qCAR4+qCAR8) showed higher P n than both NIL(qCAR4) and NIL(qCAR8), equivalent to that of Habataki despite being due to only two out of the four QTLs. The high P n of NIL(qCAR4+qCAR8) may be attributable to the high leaf nitrogen content, which may have been inherited from NIL(qCAR4), to the large hydraulic conductance due to the large root surface area from NIL(qCAR4), and to the high hydraulic conductivity from NIL(qCAR8). It might be also attributable to high mesophyll conductance, which may have been inherited from NIL(qCAR4). The induction of mesophyll conductance and the high leaf nitrogen content and high hydraulic conductivity could not be explained in isolation from the Koshihikari background. These results suggest that QTL pyramiding is a useful approach in rice breeding aimed at increasing P n.
24526015	Substantial expression of novel small open reading frames in Oryza sativa.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	In our previous integrated study combining informatics and molecular biology analyses, we revealed that Arabidopsis small open reading frames (sORFs) predicted by computational analysis have biological functions in morphogenesis. Here, we report that sequences homologous to Arabidopsis sORFs are abundant in intergenic regions of the rice genome. These sequences represent a subset of non-protein-coding DNA, and some are transcribed into mRNA. These results indicate that many sORFs associated with morphogenesis are hidden in the genomes of crop species.
24397549	Effects of NAD kinase 2 overexpression on primary metabolite profiles in rice leaves under elevated carbon dioxide.	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is projected to double by the end of the 21st century. In C3 plants, elevated CO2 concentrations promote photosynthesis but inhibit the assimilation of nitrate into organic nitrogen compounds. Several steps of nitrate assimilation depend on the availability of ATP and sources of reducing power, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Plastid-localised NAD kinase 2 (NADK2) plays key roles in increasing the ATP/ADP and NADP(H)/NAD(H) ratios. Here we examined the effects of NADK2 overexpression on primary metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa) leaves in response to elevated CO2. By using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry, we showed that the primary metabolite profile of NADK2-overexpressing plants clearly differed from that of wild-type plants under ambient and elevated CO2. In NADK2-overexpressing leaves, expression of the genes encoding glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase was up-regulated, and the levels of Asn, Gln, Arg, and Lys increased in response to elevated CO2. The present study suggests that overexpression of NADK2 promotes the biosynthesis of nitrogen-rich amino acids under elevated CO2.
21258067	Discovery of genome-wide DNA polymorphisms in a landrace cultivar of Japonica rice by whole-genome sequencing.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Molecular breeding approaches are of growing importance to crop improvement. However, closely related cultivars generally used for crossing material lack sufficient known DNA polymorphisms due to their genetic relatedness. Next-generation sequencing allows the identification of a massive number of DNA polymorphisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions-deletions (InDels) between highly homologous genomes. Using this technology, we performed whole-genome sequencing of a landrace of japonica rice, Omachi, which is used for sake brewing and is an important source for modern cultivars. A total of 229 million reads, each comprising 75 nucleotides of the Omachi genome, was generated with 45-fold coverage and uniquely mapped to 89.7% of the Nipponbare genome, a closely related cultivar. We identified 132,462 SNPs, 16,448 insertions and 19,318 deletions between the Omachi and Nipponbare genomes. An SNP array was designed to validate 731 selected SNPs, resulting in validation rates of 95 and 88% for the Omachi and Nipponbare genomes, respectively. Among the 577 SNPs validated in both genomes, 532 are entirely new SNP markers not previously reported between related rice cultivars. We also validated InDels on a part of chromosome 2 as DNA markers and successfully genotyped five japonica rice cultivars. Our results present the methodology and extensive data on SNPs and InDels available for whole-genome genotyping and marker-assisted breeding. The polymorphism information between Omachi and Nipponbare is available at NGRC_Rice_Omachi (http://www.nodai-genome.org/oryza_sativa_en.html).
21186176	RiceFOX: a database of Arabidopsis mutant lines overexpressing rice full-length cDNA that contains a wide range of trait information to facilitate analysis of gene function.	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Identification of gene function is important not only for basic research but also for applied science, especially with regard to improvements in crop production. For rapid and efficient elucidation of useful traits, we developed a system named FOX hunting (Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressor gene hunting) using full-length cDNAs (fl-cDNAs). A heterologous expression approach provides a solution for the high-throughput characterization of gene functions in agricultural plant species. Since fl-cDNAs contain all the information of functional mRNAs and proteins, we introduced rice fl-cDNAs into Arabidopsis plants for systematic gain-of-function mutation. We generated >30,000 independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing rice fl-cDNAs (rice FOX Arabidopsis mutant lines). These rice FOX Arabidopsis lines were screened systematically for various criteria such as morphology, photosynthesis, UV resistance, element composition, plant hormone profile, metabolite profile/fingerprinting, bacterial resistance, and heat and salt tolerance. The information obtained from these screenings was compiled into a database named 'RiceFOX'. This database contains around 18,000 records of rice FOX Arabidopsis lines and allows users to search against all the observed results, ranging from morphological to invisible traits. The number of searchable items is approximately 100; moreover, the rice FOX Arabidopsis lines can be searched by rice and Arabidopsis gene/protein identifiers, sequence similarity to the introduced rice fl-cDNA and traits. The RiceFOX database is available at http://ricefox.psc.riken.jp/.
20878143	Mapping 49 quantitative trait loci at high resolution through sequencing-based genotyping of rice recombinant inbred lines.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Mapping chromosome regions responsible for quantitative phenotypic variation in recombinant populations provides an effective means to characterize the genetic basis of complex traits. We conducted a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of 150 rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two cultivars, Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11 and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. The RILs were genotyped through next-generation sequencing, which accurately determined the recombination breakpoints and provided a new type of genetic markers, recombination bins, for QTL analysis. We detected 49 QTL with phenotypic effect ranging from 3.2 to 46.0% for 14 agronomics traits. Five QTL of relatively large effect (14.6-46.0%) were located on small genomic regions, where strong candidate genes were found. The analysis using sequencing-based genotyping thus offers a powerful solution to map QTL with high resolution. Moreover, the RILs developed in this study serve as an excellent system for mapping and studying genetic basis of agricultural and biological traits of rice.
24280096	Proteomic analysis of a disease-resistance-enhanced lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf 5 in rice.	2013	Rice (N Y)	BACKGROUND: A lesion-mimic mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.), spotted leaf 5 (spl5), displays a disease-resistance-enhanced phenotype, indicating that SPL5 negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses. To understand the molecular mechanisms of SPL5 mutation-induced cell death and resistance responses, a proteomics-based approach was used to identify differentially accumulated proteins between the spl5 mutant and wild type (WT).

RESULTS: Proteomic data from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that 14 candidate proteins were significantly up- or down-regulated in the spl5 mutant compared with WT. These proteins are involved in diverse biological processes including pre-mRNA splicing, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, and defense responses. Two candidate proteins with a significant up-regulation in spl5 - APX7, a key ROS metabolism enzyme and Chia2a, a pathogenesis-related protein - were further analyzed by qPCR and enzyme activity assays. Consistent with the proteomic results, both transcript levels and enzyme activities of APX7 and Chia2a were significantly induced during the course of lesion formation in spl5 leaves.

CONCLUSIONS: Many functional proteins involving various metabolisms were likely to be responsible for the lesion formation of spl5 mutant. Generally, in spl5, the up-regulated proteins involve in defense response or PCD, and the down-regulated ones involve in amino acid metabolism and photosynthesis. These results may help to gain new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying spl5-induced cell death and disease resistance in plants.
11124253	Molecular cloning of a novel importin alpha homologue from rice, by which constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) nuclear localization signal (NLS)-protein is preferentially nuclear imported.	2001	J Biol Chem	Nuclear import of proteins that contain classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) is initiated by importin alpha, a protein that recognizes and binds to the NLS in the cytoplasm. In this paper, we have cloned a cDNA for a novel importin alpha homologue from rice which is in addition to our previously isolated rice importin alpha1a and alpha2, and we have named it rice importin alpha1b. In vitro binding and nuclear import assays using recombinant importin alpha1b protein demonstrate that rice importin alpha1b functions as a component of the NLS-receptor in plant cells. Analysis of the transcript levels for all three rice importin alpha genes revealed that the genes were not only differentially expressed but that they also responded to dark-adaptation in green leaves. Furthermore, we also show that the COP1 protein bears a bipartite-type NLS and its nuclear import is mediated preferentially by the rice importin alpha1b. These data suggest that each of the different rice importin alpha proteins carry distinct groups of nuclear proteins, such that multiple isoforms of importin alpha contribute to the regulation of plant nuclear protein transport.
12618411	Genome-wide analysis of mariner-like transposable elements in rice reveals complex relationships with stowaway miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs).	2003	Genetics	Stowaway is a superfamily of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) that is widespread and abundant in plant genomes. Like other MITEs, however, its origin and mode of amplification are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence point to plant mariner-like elements (MLEs) as the autonomous partners of the nonautonomous Stowaway MITEs. To better understand this relationship, we have taken advantage of the nearly complete genome sequences of two rice subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually all MLEs and Stowaway families coexisting in a single plant species. Thirty-four different MLEs were found to group into three major clades and 25 families. More than 22,000 Stowaway MITEs were identified and classified into 36 families. On the basis of detailed sequence comparisons, MLEs were confirmed to be the best candidate autonomous elements for Stowaway MITEs. Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between MLE and Stowaway families was restricted to the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and, in a few cases, to adjacent subterminal sequences. These data suggest a model whereby most of the Stowaway MITEs in rice were cross-mobilized by MLE transposases encoded by distantly related elements.
9933584	beta-subunit of nuclear pore-targeting complex (importin-beta) can be exported from the nucleus in a Ran-independent manner.	1999	J Biol Chem	The nuclear export of importin-alpha is mediated by CAS, which is related to importin-beta, whereas the mechanism for the export of importin-beta remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the nuclear export of importin-beta is mediated by the nuclear pore complex-binding domain of this molecule. Insensitivity to leptomycin B indicates that its export is not mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal-specific receptor, CRM1. Furthermore, the nuclear export of importin-beta was not inhibited by co-injection with a GTPase-deficient Ran mutant (G19V). The cell line tsBN2 contains a temperature-sensitive point mutation in the RCC1 gene, which encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Ran. At the nonpermissive temperature, importin-beta was exported from the nucleus of these cells, even when RanGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Ran, was co-injected. These results not only provide support for the view that Ran-dependent GTP hydrolysis is not required for the nuclear export of importin-beta but also indicate that nuclear RanGTP is not essential for its export. As a result, we propose that importin-beta can be recycled from the nucleus alone in a Ran-independent manner.
12087189	Characterization of the repetitive sequences in a 200-kb region around the rice waxy locus: diversity of transposable elements and presence of veiled repetitive sequences.	2002	Genes Genet Syst	Repetitive genomic sequences might have various structural features and properties distinct from those of the known transposable elements (TE). Here, the content and properties of the repetitive sequences present in a 200-kb region around the rice waxy locus were analyzed using the available rice genomic database. In our previous Southern blotting analysis, 70% of the segments in this region showed smeared patterns, but according to the present database analysis, the proportion of repetitive sequences in this region was only 15%. The repetitive segments in this 200-kb region comprised 75 repetitive sequences that we classified into 46 subfamilies: 21 subfamilies were known TEs or repetitive sequences and 25 subfamilies consisted of newly identified TEs or novel types of repetitive sequences. The region contains no long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposable elements, but miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) constituted a major class among the elements identified. These MITEs showed remarkable structural divergence: 12 elements were found to be new members of known MITE superfamilies, while five elements had novel terminal structures, and did not belong to any known TE families. Interestingly, about 10% of the repetitive sequences, including virus-like sequences did not have any of the usual characteristics of TEs, suggesting that a certain proportion of repetitive sequences that might not share the transpositional mechanisms of known elements are dispersed in the compact rice genome.
8061524	Stowaway: a new family of inverted repeat elements associated with the genes of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.	1994	Plant Cell	Members of a new inverted repeat element family, named Stowaway, have been found in close association with more than 40 monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant genes listed in the GenBank and EMBL nucleic acid data bases. Stowaway elements are characterized by a conserved terminal inverted repeat, small size, target site specificity (TA), and potential form stable DNA secondary structures. Some elements are located at the extreme 3' ends of sequenced cDNAs and supply polyadenylation signals to their host genes. Other elements are in the 5' upstream regions of several genes and appear to contain previously identified cis-acting regulatory domains. Although the Stowaway elements share many structural features with the recently discovered Tourist elements, the two families share no significant sequence similarity. Together, the Stowaway and Tourist families serve to define an important new class of short inverted repeat elements found in possibly all flowering plant genomes.
20511295	Distinct regulation of adaxial-abaxial polarity in anther patterning in rice.	2010	Plant Cell	Establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity is essential for lateral organ development. The mechanisms underlying the polarity establishment in the stamen remain unclear, whereas those in the leaf are well understood. Here, we investigated a rod-like lemma (rol) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa), in which the development of the stamen and lemma is severely compromised. We found that the rod-like structure of the lemma and disturbed anther patterning resulted from defects in the regulation of adaxial-abaxial polarity. Gene isolation indicated that the rol phenotype was caused by a weak mutation in SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), which encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and functions in trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-siRNA) production. Thus, ta-siRNA likely plays an important role in regulating the adaxial-abaxial polarity of floral organs in rice. Furthermore, we found that the spatial expression patterns of marker genes for adaxial-abaxial polarity are rearranged during anther development in the wild type. After this rearrangement, a newly formed polarity is likely to be established in a new developmental unit, the theca primordium. This idea is supported by observations of abnormal stamen development in the shl2-rol mutant. By contrast, the stamen filament is likely formed by abaxialization. Thus, a unique regulatory mechanism may be involved in regulating adaxial-abaxial polarity in stamen development.
18627494	Genome-wide analysis of a land plant-specific acyl:coenzyme A synthetase (ACS) gene family in Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and Physcomitrella.	2008	New Phytol	The plant enzyme 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is part of a family of adenylate-forming enzymes present in all organisms. Analysis of genome sequences shows the presence of '4CL-like' enzymes in plants and other organisms, but their evolutionary relationships and functions remain largely unknown. 4CL and 4CL-like genes were identified by BLAST searches in Arabidopsis, Populus, rice, Physcomitrella, Chlamydomonas and microbial genomes. Evolutionary relationships were inferred by phylogenetic analysis of aligned amino acid sequences. Expression patterns of a conserved set of Arabidopsis and poplar 4CL-like acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) genes were assayed. The conserved ACS genes form a land plant-specific class. Angiosperm ACS genes grouped into five clades, each of which contained representatives in three fully sequenced genomes. Expression analysis revealed conserved developmental and stress-induced expression patterns of Arabidopsis and poplar genes in some clades. Evolution of plant ACS enzymes occurred early in land plants. Differential gene expansion of angiosperm ACS clades has occurred in some lineages. Evolutionary and gene expression data, combined with in vitro and limited in vivo protein function data, suggest that angiosperm ACS enzymes play conserved roles in octadecanoid and fatty acid metabolism, and play roles in organ development, for example in anthers.
21335373	The Arabidopsis bHLH transcription factors MYC3 and MYC4 are targets of JAZ repressors and act additively with MYC2 in the activation of jasmonate responses.	2011	Plant Cell	Jasmonates (JAs) trigger an important transcriptional reprogramming of plant cells to modulate both basal development and stress responses. In spite of the importance of transcriptional regulation, only one transcription factor (TF), the Arabidopsis thaliana basic helix-loop-helix MYC2, has been described so far as a direct target of JAZ repressors. By means of yeast two-hybrid screening and tandem affinity purification strategies, we identified two previously unknown targets of JAZ repressors, the TFs MYC3 and MYC4, phylogenetically closely related to MYC2. We show that MYC3 and MYC4 interact in vitro and in vivo with JAZ repressors and also form homo- and heterodimers with MYC2 and among themselves. They both are nuclear proteins that bind DNA with sequence specificity similar to that of MYC2. Loss-of-function mutations in any of these two TFs impair full responsiveness to JA and enhance the JA insensitivity of myc2 mutants. Moreover, the triple mutant myc2 myc3 myc4 is as impaired as coi1-1 in the activation of several, but not all, JA-mediated responses such as the defense against bacterial pathogens and insect herbivory. Our results show that MYC3 and MYC4 are activators of JA-regulated programs that act additively with MYC2 to regulate specifically different subsets of the JA-dependent transcriptional response.
10635550	Molecular cloning and characterization of a cysteine-rich 16.6-kDa prolamin in rice seeds.	1999	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	An alcohol-soluble storage protein, a 16.6-kDa prolamin found in rice seeds, was purified from both the total protein body and purified type I protein body fractions. The partial amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides generated from the purified polypeptide were analyzed. A part of the 16.6-kDa prolamin cDNA was amplified from developing seed mRNA by the reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction using an oligo (dT) primer and a primer which was synthesized based on the partial amino acid sequence. The amplified product was used to isolate the full-length cDNA clone (lambda RP16) from a developing seed cDNA library. The cDNA has an open reading frame encoding a hydrophobic polypeptide of 149 amino acids. The polypeptide was rich in glutamine (20.0%), cysteine (10.0%), and methionine (6.9%). The cysteine content was higher than those of most other rice storage proteins. Messenger RNA of the 16.6-kDa prolamin was detected in seeds, but not in other aerial tissues.
10557228	Okadaic Acid Mimics Nitrogen-Stimulated Transcription of the NADH-Glutamate Synthase Gene in Rice Cell Cultures.	1999	Plant Physiol	Okadaic acid (OKA), a potent and specific inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A, induced the accumulation of NADH-glutamate synthase (GOGAT) mRNA within 4 h in rice (Oryza sativa L.) cell cultures. In contrast to the transient accumulation of NADH-GOGAT mRNA by NH(4)(+), OKA caused a continuous accumulation for at least 24 h. The induction of NADH-GOGAT mRNA by OKA was not inhibited in the presence of methionine sulfoximine, which inhibited the NH(4)(+)-induced accumulation of mRNA. These results suggest that the OKA-sensitive protein phosphatase is involved in the regulation of NADH-GOGAT gene expression and probably plays a role in the signal transduction pathway downstream from NH(4)(+), although a signal transduction pathway other than that of nitrogen sensing could be responsible. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that the accumulation of NADH-GOGAT mRNA induced by the supply of either NH(4)(+) or OKA was mainly regulated at the transcription level. OKA effects were synergistic to the NH(4)(+)-induced expression of the NADH-GOGAT gene. In the presence of K-252a, a protein kinase inhibitor, the accumulation of NADH-GOGAT mRNA induced by either NH(4)(+) or OKA was reduced. The possible roles of protein phosphatases in the regulation of NADH-GOGAT gene expression are discussed.
14966247	Evolutionary dynamics of the DNA-binding domains in putative R2R3-MYB genes identified from rice subspecies indica and japonica genomes.	2004	Plant Physiol	The molecular evolution of the R2R3-MYB gene family is of great interest because it is one of the most important transcription factor gene families in the plant kingdom. Comparative analyses of a gene family may reveal important adaptive changes at the protein level and thereby provide insights that relate structure to function. We have performed a range of comparative and bioinformatics analyses on R2R3-MYB genes identified from the rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica and indica) and Arabidopsis genome sequences. The study provides an initial framework to investigate how different evolutionary lineages in a gene family evolve new functions. Our results reveal a remarkable excess of non-synonymous substitutions, an indication of adaptive selection on protein structure that occurred during the evolution of both helix1 and helix2 of rice R2R3-MYB DNA-binding domains. These flexible alpha-helix regions associated with high frequencies of excess non-synonymous substitutions may play critical roles in the characteristic packing of R2R3-MYB DNA-binding domains and thereby modify the protein-DNA interaction process resulting in the recognition of novel DNA-binding sites. Furthermore, a co-evolutionary pattern is found between the second alpha-helix of the R2 domain and the second alpha-helix of the R3 domain by examining all the possible alpha-helix pairings in both the R2 and R3 domains. This points to the functional importance of pairing interactions between related secondary structures.
24604734	Conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes negatively regulate drought resistance in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	MicroRNAs constitute a large group of endogenous small RNAs of ~22 nt that emerge as vital regulators, mainly by targeting mRNAs for post-transcriptional repression. Previous studies have revealed that the miR164 family in Arabidopsis is comprised of three members which guide the cleavage of the mRNAs of five NAC genes to modulate developmental processes. However, the functions of the miR164-targeted NAC genes in crops are poorly deciphered. In this study, the conserved features of six miR164-targeted NAC genes (OMTN1-OMTN6) in rice are described, and evidence is provided that four of them confer a negative regulatory role in drought resistance. OMTN proteins have the characteristics of typical NAC transcriptional factors. The miR164 recognition sites of the OMTN genes are highly conserved in rice germplasms. Deletion of the recognition sites impaired the transactivation activity, indicating that the conserved recognition sites play a crucial role in maintaining the function of the OMTN proteins. The OMTN genes were responsive to abiotic stresses, and showed diverse spatio-temporal expression patterns in rice. Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage. The expression of numerous genes related to stress response, development, and metabolism was altered in OMTN2-, OMTN3-, OMTN4-, and OMTN6-overexpressing plants. Most of the up-regulated genes in the OMTN-overexpressing plants were down-regulated by drought stress. The results suggest that the conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes may be negative regulators of drought tolerance in rice, in addition to their reported roles in development.
24489802	Overexpression of rice NAC gene SNAC1 improves drought and salt tolerance by enhancing root development and reducing transpiration rate in transgenic cotton.	2014	PLoS One	The SNAC1 gene belongs to the stress-related NAC superfamily of transcription factors. It was identified from rice and overexpressed in cotton cultivar YZ1 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. SNAC1-overexpressing cotton plants showed more vigorous growth, especially in terms of root development, than the wild-type plants in the presence of 250 mM NaCl under hydroponic growth conditions. The content of proline was enhanced but the MDA content was decreased in the transgenic cotton seedlings under drought and salt treatments compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, SNAC1-overexpressing cotton plants also displayed significantly improved tolerance to both drought and salt stresses in the greenhouse. The performances of the SNAC1-overexpressing lines under drought and salt stress were significantly better than those of the wild-type in terms of the boll number. During the drought and salt treatments, the transpiration rate of transgenic plants significantly decreased in comparison to the wild-type, but the photosynthesis rate maintained the same at the flowering stage in the transgenic plants. These results suggested that overexpression of SNAC1 improve more tolerance to drought and salt in cotton through enhanced root development and reduced transpiration rates.
24058359	Roles of NAC transcription factors in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants.	2013	Front Microbiol	NAC transcription factors are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants, and members of the NAC gene family have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant stress responses. A phylogenetic analysis of NAC genes, with a focus on rice and Arabidopsis, was performed. Herein, we present an overview of the regulation of the stress responsive NAC SNAC/(IX) group of genes that are implicated in the resistance to different stresses. SNAC factors have important roles for the control of biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance and that their overexpression can improve stress tolerance via biotechnological approaches. We also review the recent progress in elucidating the roles of NAC transcription factors in plant biotic and abiotic stresses. Modification of the expression pattern of transcription factor genes and/or changes in their activity contribute to the elaboration of various signaling pathways and regulatory networks. However, a single NAC gene often responds to several stress factors, and their protein products may participate in the regulation of several seemingly disparate processes as negative or positive regulators. Additionally, the NAC proteins function via auto-regulation or cross-regulation is extensively found among NAC genes. These observations assist in the understanding of the complex mechanisms of signaling and transcriptional reprogramming controlled by NAC proteins.
19697058	Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of OsNAC5, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor.	2009	Planta	Rice is a poor source of micronutrients such as iron and zinc. To help clarify the molecular mechanisms that regulate metal mobilization from leaves to developing seeds, we conducted suppression subtractive hybridization analysis in flag leaves of two rice cultivars. Flag leaves are the major source of remobilized metals for developing seeds. We isolated 78 sequences up-regulated in flag leaves at the grain filling stage relative to the panicle exertion stage. Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. We show that OsNAC5 expression is up-regulated by natural (aging) and induced senescence processes (dark, ABA application, high salinity, cold and Fe-deficiency) and its expression is not affected in the presence of 6-benzylaminopurine (a senescence inhibitor) under dark-induced senescence. Salt induction of OsNAC5 expression is abolished by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of ABA effects. This result and the presence of cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the OsNAC5 gene suggest an ABA-dependent regulation. Using four different rice cultivars, we show that OsNAC5 up-regulation is higher and earlier in flag leaves and panicles of IR75862 plants, which have higher seed concentrations of Fe, Zn and protein. We suggest that OsNAC5 is a novel senescence-associated ABA-dependent NAC transcription factor and its function could be related to Fe, Zn and amino acids remobilization from green tissues to seeds.
18813954	Systematic sequence analysis and identification of tissue-specific or stress-responsive genes of NAC transcription factor family in rice.	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factors comprise a large plant-specific gene family and a few members of this family have been characterized for their roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. In this study, systematic sequence analysis revealed 140 putative NAC or NAC-like genes (ONAC) in rice. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that NAC family can be divided into five groups (I-V). Among them, all the published development-related genes fell into group I, and all the published stress-related NAC genes fell into the group III (namely stress-responsive NAC genes, SNAC). Distinct compositions of the putative motifs were revealed on the basis of NAC protein sequences in rice. Most members contained a complete NAC DNA-binding domain and a variable transcriptional regulation domain. Sequence analysis, together with the organization of putative motifs, indicated distinct structures and potential diverse functions of NAC family in rice. Yeast one-hybrid analysis confirmed that 12 NAC proteins representing different motif compositions can bind the NAC core DNA-binding site. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed 12 genes with different tissue-specific (such as callus, root, stamen, or immature endosperm) expression patterns, suggesting that these genes may play crucial regulatory roles during growth and development of rice. The expression levels of this family were also checked under various abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and low temperature. A preliminary check based on our microarray data suggested that more than 40 genes of this family were responsive to drought and/or salt stresses. Among them, 20 genes were further investigated for their stress responsiveness in detail by real-time PCR analysis. Most of these stress-responsive genes belonged to the group III (SNAC). Considering the fact that a very limited number of genes of the NAC family have been characterized, our data provide a very useful reference for functional analysis of this family in rice.
24764506	Toward understanding transcriptional regulatory networks in abiotic stress responses and tolerance in rice.	2012	Rice (N Y)	Abiotic stress causes loss of crop production. Under abiotic stress conditions, expression of many genes is induced, and their products have important roles in stress responses and tolerance. Progress has been made in understanding the biological roles of regulons in abiotic stress responses in rice. A number of transcription factors (TFs) regulate stress-responsive gene expression. OsDREB1s and OsDREB2s were identified as abiotic-stress responsive TFs that belong to the AP2/ERF family. Similar to Arabidopsis, these DREB regulons were most likely not involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) pathway. OsAREBs such as OsAREB1 were identified as key components in ABA-dependent transcriptional networks in rice. OsNAC/SNACs including OsNAC6 were characterized as factors that regulate expression of genes important for abiotic stress responses in rice. Here, we review on the rice abiotic-stress responses mediated by transcriptional networks, with the main focus on TFs that function in abiotic stress responses and confer stress tolerance in rice.
20807373	Supra-optimal expression of the cold-regulated OsMyb4 transcription factor in transgenic rice changes the complexity of transcriptional network with major effects on stress tolerance and panicle development.	2010	Plant Cell Environ	The R2R3-type OsMyb4 transcription factor of rice has been shown to play a role in the regulation of osmotic adjustment in heterologous overexpression studies. However, the exact composition and organization of its underlying transcriptional network has not been established to be a robust tool for stress tolerance enhancement by regulon engineering. OsMyb4 network was dissected based on commonalities between the global chilling stress transcriptome and the transcriptome configured by OsMyb4 overexpression. OsMyb4 controls a hierarchical network comprised of several regulatory sub-clusters associated with cellular defense and rescue, metabolism and development. It regulates target genes either directly or indirectly through intermediary MYB, ERF, bZIP, NAC, ARF and CCAAT-HAP transcription factors. Regulatory sub-clusters have different combinations of MYB-like, GCC-box-like, ERD1-box-like, ABRE-like, G-box-like, as1/ocs/TGA-like, AuxRE-like, gibberellic acid response element (GARE)-like and JAre-like cis-elements. Cold-dependent network activity enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity through radical scavenging mechanisms and increased activities of phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid metabolic processes involving various abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive genes. OsMyb4 network is independent of drought response element binding protein/C-repeat binding factor (DREB/CBF) and its sub-regulons operate with possible co-regulators including nuclear factor-Y. Because of its upstream position in the network hierarchy, OsMyb4 functions quantitatively and pleiotrophically. Supra-optimal expression causes misexpression of alternative targets with costly trade-offs to panicle development.
24093634	Genome-wide identification of WRKY45-regulated genes that mediate benzothiadiazole-induced defense responses in rice.	2013	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: The rice transcription factor WRKY45 plays a crucial role in salicylic acid (SA)/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced disease resistance. Its knockdown severely reduces BTH-induced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Conversely, overexpression of WRKY45 induces extremely strong resistance to both of these pathogens. To elucidate the molecular basis of WRKY45-dependent disease resistance, we analyzed WRKY45-regulated gene expression using rice transformants and a transient gene expression system.

RESULTS: We conducted a microarray analysis using WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice plants, and identified WRKY45-dependent genes among the BTH-responsive genes. The BTH-responsiveness of 260 genes was dependent on WRKY45. Among these, 220 genes (85%), many of which encoded PR proteins and proteins associated with secondary metabolism, were upregulated by BTH. Only a small portion of these genes overlapped with those regulated by OsNPR1/NH1, supporting the idea that the rice SA pathway branches into WRKY45- regulated and OsNPR1/NH1-regulated subpathways. Dexamethazone-induced expression of myc-tagged WRKY45 in rice immediately upregulated transcription of endogenous WRKY45 and genes encoding the transcription factors WRKY62, OsNAC4, and HSF1, all of which have been reported to have defense-related functions. This was followed by upregulation of defense genes encoding PR proteins and secondary metabolic enzymes. Many of these genes were also induced after M. oryzae infection. Their temporal transcription patterns were consistent with those after dexamethazone-induced WRKY45 expression. In a transient expression system consisting of particle bombardment of rice coleoptiles, WRKY45 acted as an effector to trans-activate reporter genes in which the luciferase coding sequence was fused to upstream and intragenic sequences of WRKY62 and OsNAC4. Trans-activation of transcription occurred through a W-box-containing sequence upstream of OsNAC4 and mutations in the W-boxes abolished the trans-activation.

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a role of WRKY45 in BTH-induced disease resistance as a master regulator of the transcriptional cascade regulating defense responses in one of two branches in the rice SA pathway.
23696671	Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction.	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar "Modan." Pb1 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb1-mediated blast resistance. The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar. Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice. Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice. Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1. Overexpression of Pb1 with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice. These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus. In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance.
16117849	OsWRKY03, a rice transcriptional activator that functions in defense signaling pathway upstream of OsNPR1.	2005	Cell Res	WRKY family proteins are a class of plant specific transcription factors that involve in many stress response pathways. It has been shown that one Arabidopsis WRKY protein, AtWRKY29/22, is activated by MAP kinase signaling cascade and confers resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens. However, little is known about the biological roles of WRKY proteins in rice. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of rice AtWRKY29/22 homolog, OsWRKY03, under different conditions, and also its possible role involved in plant defense. Our results showed that OsWRKY03 was up-regulated by several defense signaling molecules or different treatments. Further analysis revealed that the expression of OsWRKY03 was light dependent. Transcriptional activation activity of OsWRKY03 was also demonstrated by yeast functional assay. Transient expression of OsWRKY03-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermis cells showed that OsWRKY03 was a nuclear localized protein. OsNPR1 as well as several other pathogenesis-related genes, such as OsPR1b, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (ZB8) and peroxidase (POX22.3), were induced in OsWRKY03-overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicated that OsWRKY03 is located upstream of OsNPR1 as a transcriptional activator in salicylic acid (SA)-dependent or jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense signaling cascades.
24619999	Identification and utilization of cleistogamy gene cl7(t) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	J Exp Bot	Gene transformation is an important method for improvement of plants into elite varieties. However, the possibility of gene flow between genetically modified (GM) crops and similar species is a serious public issue that may potentially endanger ecological stability. Cleistogamy is expected to be an ideal genetic tool for preventing transgene propagation from GM crops. A rice mutant, cl7(t), was created by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. The mutant exhibited cleistogamy, and had closed spikelets, reduced plant height, and altered morphology of the leaves, panicle, and seeds. Anatomical investigations revealed that the cl7(t) mutant contained more vascular bundles and thicker stems than the wild type, which increased the mechanical strength of its internodes, and anti-lodging ability. Further studies demonstrated that the force required to open the lemma and palea was higher in the cl7(t) mutant, and there was weak swelling ability in the lodicules, which leads to cleistogamy. Allelic analyses and complementation tests indicated that cl7(t) was a novel allele of dep2, a mutant that was previously reported to have similar panicle morphology. Sequence analysis showed that cl7(t) had a single nucleotide substitution (C to A) in the third exon that leads to a Ser substitution with a stop codon, giving a truncated DEP2 protein. Quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization tests demonstrated that there was lower CL7(t) expression level in the spikelets and weaker CL7(t) signals in the lodicules of the cl7(t) mutant compared with wild type, which implies that CL7(t) might participate in the development of lodicules. To improve the agronomic traits of cl7(t) to fit the needs of field production, the cl7(t) mutant was crossed with an intermediate-type rice variety named Guanghui102, which bears some important agronomic traits, including increased grain numbers and high rate of seed setting. Through multi-generational pedigree selection, cleistogamy lines with improved economic traits were obtained, which can be used for the selection of ecologically safe GM rice varieties.
24503697	Momilactone B induces apoptosis and G1 arrest of the cell cycle in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells through downregulation of pRB phosphorylation and induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1.	2014	Oncol Rep	Momilactone B, a terpenoid phytoalexin present in rice bran, has been shown to exhibit several biological activities. The present study was conducted using cultured human leukemia U937 cells to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which momilactone B exerts its anticancer activity, which to date has remained poorly understood. Momilactone B treatment of U937 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death as detected by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Annexin V-FITC staining. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that momilactone B resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression, which was associated with the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and enhanced binding of pRB with the E2F transcription factor family proteins. Treatment with momilactone B also increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 in a p53-independent manner, without any noticeable changes in G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), except a slight decrease in cyclin E. Moreover, in vitro kinase assay indicated that momilactone B significantly decreased Cdk4- and Cdk6-associated kinase activities through a notably increased binding of p21 to Cdk4 and Cdk6. Our results demonstrated that momilactone B caused G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in U937 cells through the induction of p21 expression, inhibition of Cdk/cyclin-associated kinase activities, and reduced phosphorylation of pRB, which may be related to anticancer activity.
24661882	Allele-mining of rice blast resistance genes at AC134922 locus.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The AC134922 locus is one of the most rapidly evolving nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family in rice genome. Six rice blast resistance (R) genes have been cloned from this locus and other two resistance candidate genes, Pi34 and Pi47, are also mapped to this complex locus. Therefore, it seems that more functional R genes could be identified from this locus. In this study, we cloned 22 genes from 12 cultivars based on allele-mining strategy at this locus and identified 6 rice blast R genes with 4 of them recognizing more than one isolates. Our result suggests that gene stacking might be the evolutionary strategy for complex gene locus to interact with rapidly evolving pathogens, which might provide a potential way for the cloning of durable resistance genes. Moreover, the mosaic structure and ambiguous ortholog/paralog relationships of these homologous genes, caused by frequent recombination and gene conversion, indicate that multiple alleles of this complex locus may serve as a reservoir for the evolutionary novelty of these R genes.
24643423	The relationship between PMI (manA) gene expression and optimal selection pressure in Indica rice transformation.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	KEY MESSAGE: An efficient mannose selection system was established for transformation of Indica cultivar IR58025B . Different selection pressures were required to achieve optimum transformation frequency for different PMI selectable marker cassettes. This study was conducted to establish an efficient transformation system for Indica rice, cultivar IR58025B. Four combinations of two promoters, rice Actin 1 and maize Ubiquitin 1, and two manA genes, native gene from E. coli (PMI-01) and synthetic maize codon-optimized gene (PMI-09) were compared under various concentrations of mannose. Different selection pressures were required for different gene cassettes to achieve corresponding optimum transformation frequency (TF). Higher TFs as 54 and 53% were obtained when 5 g/L mannose was used for selection of prActin-PMI-01 cassette and 7.5 g/L mannose used for selection of prActin-PMI-09, respectively. TFs as 67 and 56% were obtained when 7.5 and 15 g/L mannose were used for selection of prUbi-PMI-01 and prUbi-PMI-09, respectively. We conclude that higher TFs can be achieved for different gene cassettes when an optimum selection pressure is applied. By investigating the PMI expression level in transgenic calli and leaves, we found there was a significant positive correlation between the protein expression level and the optimal selection pressure. Higher optimal selection pressure is required for those constructs which confer higher expression of PMI protein. The single copy rate of those transgenic events for prActin-PMI-01 cassette is lower than that for other three cassettes. We speculate some of low copy events with low protein expression levels might not have been able to survive in the mannose selection.
24406793	A novel rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP72A31, confers tolerance to acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides in rice and Arabidopsis.	2014	Plant Physiol	Target-site and non-target-site herbicide tolerance are caused by the prevention of herbicide binding to the target enzyme and the reduction to a nonlethal dose of herbicide reaching the target enzyme, respectively. There is little information on the molecular mechanisms involved in non-target-site herbicide tolerance, although it poses the greater threat in the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds and could potentially be useful for the production of herbicide-tolerant crops because it is often involved in tolerance to multiherbicides. Bispyribac sodium (BS) is an herbicide that inhibits the activity of acetolactate synthase. Rice (Oryza sativa) of the indica variety show BS tolerance, while japonica rice varieties are BS sensitive. Map-based cloning and complementation tests revealed that a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP72A31, is involved in BS tolerance. Interestingly, BS tolerance was correlated with CYP72A31 messenger RNA levels in transgenic plants of rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Moreover, Arabidopsis overexpressing CYP72A31 showed tolerance to bensulfuron-methyl (BSM), which belongs to a different class of acetolactate synthase-inhibiting herbicides, suggesting that CYP72A31 can metabolize BS and BSM to a compound with reduced phytotoxicity. On the other hand, we showed that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6, which has been reported to confer BSM tolerance, is barely involved, if at all, in BS tolerance, suggesting that the CYP72A31 enzyme has different herbicide specificities compared with CYP81A6. Thus, the CYP72A31 gene is a potentially useful genetic resource in the fields of weed control, herbicide development, and molecular breeding in a broad range of crop species.
24530223	Identification of trans-acting factors regulating SamDC expression in Oryza sativa.	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Abiotic stress affects the growth and productivity of crop plants; to cope with the adverse environmental conditions, plants have developed efficient defense machinery comprising of antioxidants like phenolics and flavonoids, and osmolytes like polyamines. SamDC is a key enzyme in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway in plants. In our present communication we have done in silico analysis of the promoter region of SamDC to look for the presence of different cis-regulatory elements contributing to its expression. Based on the presence of different cis-regulatory elements we completed comparative analysis of SamDC gene expression in rice lamina of IR-29 and Nonabokra by qPCR in response to the abiotic stress treatments of salinity, drought, cold and the biotic stress treatments of ABA and light. Additionally, to explore the role of the cis-regulatory elements in regulating the expression of SamDC gene in plants we comparatively analyzed the binding of rice nuclear proteins prepared from IR-29 and Nonabokra undergoing various stress treatments. The intensity of the complex formed was low and inducible in IR-29 in contrast to Nonabokra. Southwestern blot analysis helped in predicting the size of the trans-acting factors binding to these cis-elements. To our knowledge this is the first report on the comprehensive analysis of SamDC gene expression in rice and identification of the trans-acting factors regulating its expression.
24460889	Regulatory options for genetically modified crops in India.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	The introduction of semi-dwarfing, high-yielding and nutrients-responsive crop varieties in the 1960s and 1970s alleviated the suffering of low crop yield, food shortages and epidemics of famine in India and other parts of the Asian continent. Two semi-dwarfing genes, Rht in wheat and Sd-1 in rice heralded the green revolution for which Dr. Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. In contrast, the revolutionary new genetics of crop improvement shamble over formidable obstacles of regulatory delays, political interferences and public misconceptions. India benefited immensely from the green revolution and is now grappling to deal with the nuances of GM crops. The development of GM mustard discontinued prematurely in 2001 and insect-resistant Bt cotton varieties were successfully approved for commercial cultivation in 2002 in an evolving nature of regulatory system. However, the moratorium on Bt brinjal by MOEF in 2010 meant a considerable detour from an objective, science-based, rigorous institutional process of regulatory approval to a more subjective, nonscience-driven, political decision-making process. This study examines what ails the regulatory system of GM crops in India and the steps that led to the regulatory logjam. Responding to the growing challenges and impediments of existing biosafety regulation, it suggests options that are critical for GM crops to take roots for a multiplier harvest.
24642883	Genome-wide analysis of the RNA helicase gene family in Gossypium raimondii.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	The RNA helicases, which help to unwind stable RNA duplexes, and have important roles in RNA metabolism, belong to a class of motor proteins that play important roles in plant development and responses to stress. Although this family of genes has been the subject of systematic investigation in Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato, it has not yet been characterized in cotton. In this study, we identified 161 putative RNA helicase genes in the genome of the diploid cotton species Gossypium raimondii. We classified these genes into three subfamilies, based on the presence of either a DEAD-box (51 genes), DEAH-box (52 genes), or DExD/H-box (58 genes) in their coding regions. Chromosome location analysis showed that the genes that encode RNA helicases are distributed across all 13 chromosomes of G. raimondii. Syntenic analysis revealed that 62 of the 161 G. raimondii helicase genes (38.5%) are within the identified syntenic blocks. Sixty-six (40.99%) helicase genes from G. raimondii have one or several putative orthologs in tomato. Additionally, GrDEADs have more conserved gene structures and more simple domains than GrDEAHs and GrDExD/Hs. Transcriptome sequencing data demonstrated that many of these helicases, especially GrDEADs, are highly expressed at the fiber initiation stage and in mature leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide analysis of the RNA helicase gene family in cotton.
24450460	Effectiveness and durability of the rice pi-ta gene in Yunnan province of China.	2014	Phytopathology	Rice blast is one of the most damaging diseases of rice worldwide. In the present study, we analyzed DNA sequence variation of avirulence (AVR) genes of AVR-Pita1 in field isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae in order to understand the effectiveness of the resistance gene Pi-ta in China. Genomic DNA of 366 isolates of M. oryzae collected from Yunnan province of China were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to examine the existence of AVR-Pita1 using gene-specific PCR markers. Results of PCR products revealed that 218 isolates of M. oryzae carry AVR-Pita1. Among of them, 62.5, 56.3, 58.5, 46.7, 72.4, and 57.4% of M. oryzae carry AVR-Pita1 from northeastern, southeast, western, northwest, southwestern, and central Yunnan province, respectively. The detection rate of AVR-Pita1 was, in order: southwestern > northeastern > western > central > southeastern > northwestern Yunnan province. Moreover, in total, 18 AVR-Pita1 haplotypes encoding 13 novel AVR-Pita1 variants were identified among 60 isolates. Most DNA sequence variation was found to occur in the exon region, resulting in amino acid substitution. Six virulent haplotypes of AVR-Pita1 to Pita were identified among 60 field isolates. The AVR-Pita1 has evolved to virulence from avirulent origins via base substitution. These findings demonstrate that AVR-Pita1 is under positive selection and mutations of AVR-Pita1 are responsible for defeating race-specific resistance in nature.
24498868	Diversity of floral regulatory genes of japonica rice cultivated at northern latitudes.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: Rice is considered a short day plant. Originally from tropical regions rice has been progressively adapted to temperate climates and long day conditions in part by modulating its sensitivity to day length. Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) that code for florigens, are known as major regulatory genes of floral transition in rice. Both Hd3a and RFT1 are regulated by Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Days to heading on chromosome 2 (DTH2) while Heading date 1 (Hd1) also governs Hd3a expression. To investigate the mechanism of rice adaptation to temperate climates we have analyzed the natural variation of these five genes in a collection of japonica rice representing the genetic diversity of long day cultivated rice.

RESULTS: We have investigated polymorphisms of Hd3a, RFT1, Ehd1, Hd1 and DTH2 in a collection of 57 japonica varieties. Hd3a and RFT1 were highly conserved, displaying one major allele. Expression analysis suggested that RFT1 rather than Hd3a could be the pivotal gene controlling flowering under long day conditions. While few alleles were found in the Ehd1 promoter and DTH2 coding region, a high degree of variation in Hd1, including non-functional alleles, was observed. Correlation analysis between gene expression levels and flowering periods suggested the occurrence of other factors, additionally to Ehd1, affecting RFT1 regulation in long day adapted cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS: During domestication, rice expansion was accompanied by changes in the regulatory mechanism of flowering. The existence of non-functional Hd1 alleles and the lack of correlation of their presence with flowering times in plants grown under long day conditions, indicate a minor role of this branch in this process and the existence of an alternative regulatory pathway in northern latitudes. Expression analysis data and a high degree of conservation of RFT1 suggested that this gene could be the main factor regulating flowering among japonica cultivars adapted to northern areas. In the absence of inhibition exerted by Hd1 through repression of Hd3a expression, the role of Ehd1 as a regulator of RFT1 and Hd3a appears to be reinforced. Data also indicated the occurrence of additional regulatory factors controlling flowering.
24416331	Genomic analysis of Xanthomonas translucens pathogenic on wheat and barley reveals cross-kingdom gene transfer events and diverse protein delivery systems.	2014	PLoS One	In comparison to dicot-infecting bacteria, only limited numbers of genome sequences are available for monocot-infecting and in particular cereal-infecting bacteria. Herein we report the characterisation and genome sequence of Xanthomonas translucens isolate DAR61454 pathogenic on wheat and barley. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the ATP synthase beta subunit (atpD) gene, DAR61454 is most closely related to other X. translucens strains and the sugarcane- and banana- infecting Xanthomonas strains, but shares a type III secretion system (T3SS) with X. translucens pv. graminis and more distantly related xanthomonads. Assays with an adenylate cyclase reporter protein demonstrate that DAR61454's T3SS is functional in delivering proteins to wheat cells. X. translucens DAR61454 also encodes two type VI secretion systems with one most closely related to those found in some strains of the rice infecting strain X. oryzae pv. oryzae but not other xanthomonads. Comparative analysis of 18 different Xanthomonas isolates revealed 84 proteins unique to cereal (i.e. rice) infecting isolates and the wheat/barley infecting DAR61454. Genes encoding 60 of these proteins are found in gene clusters in the X. translucens DAR61454 genome, suggesting cereal-specific pathogenicity islands. However, none of the cereal pathogen specific proteins were homologous to known Xanthomonas spp. effectors. Comparative analysis outside of the bacterial kingdom revealed a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase encoding gene in DAR61454 also present in other bacteria as well as a number of pathogenic Fusarium species, suggesting that this gene may have been transmitted horizontally from bacteria to the Fusarium lineage of pathogenic fungi. This example further highlights the importance of horizontal gene acquisition from bacteria in the evolution of fungi.
24498271	Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice.	2014	PLoS One	Plant height is an important agronomic trait that affects grain yield. Previously, we reported a novel semi-dominant dwarf mutant, HD1, derived from chemical mutagenesis using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) on a japonica rice cultivar, Hwacheong. In this study, we cloned the gene responsible for the dwarf mutant using a map-based approach. Fine mapping revealed that the mutant gene was located on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a 48 kb region. Sequencing of the candidate genes and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) analysis identified the gene, d-h, which encodes a protein of unknown function but whose sequence is conserved in other cereal crops. Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and promoter activity assays showed that the d-h gene was primarily expressed in the nodes and the panicle. In the HD1 plant, the d-h gene was found to carry a 63-bp deletion in the ORF region that was subsequently confirmed by transgenic experiments to be directly responsible for the gain-of-function phenotype observed in the mutant. Since the mutant plants exhibit a defect in GA response, but not in the GA synthetic pathway, it appears that the d-h gene may be involved in a GA signaling pathway.
24612254	Transgenic expression of the rice Xa21 pattern-recognition receptor in banana (Musa sp.) confers resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum.	2014	Plant Biotechnol J	Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), is the most devastating disease of banana in east and central Africa. The spread of BXW threatens the livelihood of millions of African farmers who depend on banana for food security and income. There are no commercial chemicals, biocontrol agents or resistant cultivars available to control BXW. Here, we take advantage of the robust resistance conferred by the rice pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), XA21, to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We identified a set of genes required for activation of Xa21-mediated immunity (rax) that were conserved in both Xoo and Xcm. Based on the conservation, we hypothesized that intergeneric transfer of Xa21 would confer resistance to Xcm. We evaluated 25 transgenic lines of the banana cultivar 'Gonja manjaya' (AAB) using a rapid bioassay and 12 transgenic lines in the glasshouse for resistance against Xcm. About 50% of the transgenic lines showed complete resistance to Xcm in both assays. In contrast, all of the nontransgenic control plants showed severe symptoms that progressed to complete wilting. These results indicate that the constitutive expression of the rice Xa21 gene in banana results in enhanced resistance against Xcm. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the feasibility of PRR gene transfer between monocotyledonous species and provides a valuable new tool for controlling the BXW pandemic of banana, a staple food for 100 million people in east Africa.
24344976	Ab initio investigation of the thermal decomposition of n-butylcyclohexane.	2014	J Phys Chem A	Environmental and energy security concerns have motivated an increased focus on developing clean, efficient combustors, which increasingly relies on insight into the combustion chemistry of fuels. In particular, naphthenes (cycloalkanes and alkylcycloalkanes) are important chemical components of distillate fuels, such as diesel and jet fuels. As such, there is a growing interest in describing napthene reactivity with kinetic mechanisms. Use of these mechanisms in predictive combustion models aids in the development of combustors. This study focuses on the pyrolysis of n-butylcyclohexane (n-BCH), an important representative of naphthenes in jet fuels. Seven different unimolecular decomposition pathways of C-C bond fission were explored utilizing ab initio/DFT methods. Accurate reaction energies were computed using the high-level quantum composite G3B3 method. Variational transition state theory, Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus/master equation simulations provided temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants. Implementation of these pathways into an existing chemical kinetic mechanism improved the prediction of experimental OH radical and H2O speciation in shock tube oxidation. Simulations of this combustion showed a change in the expected decomposition chemistry of n-BCH, predicting increased production of cyclic alkyl radicals instead of straight-chain alkenes. The most prominent reaction pathway for the decomposition of n-BCH is n-BCH = C3H7 + C7H13. The results of this study provide insight into the combustion of n-BCH and will aid in the future development of naphthene kinetic mechanisms.
24481057	A facile approach for high surface area electrospun TiO2 nanostructures for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.	2014	Dalton Trans	A rice-shaped TiO2-ZnO composite was prepared by electrospinning a mixture comprising the precursors of TiO2 and ZnO in polyvinyl acetate polymer dissolved in N,N-dimethyl acetamide. The electrospun nanofibers upon heat treatment in air resulted in collapse of the continuous fiber morphology and the formation of the rice-shaped TiO2-ZnO composite. The TiO2-ZnO composite was then treated with dilute acetic acid under hydrothermal conditions to etch ZnO from the TiO2-ZnO composite to get coral-shaped anisotropic TiO2. The structural anisotropy of TiO2 produced by the selective etching of ZnO resulted in a high surface area of 148 m(2) g(-1) for the TiO2. The initial and final materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman and XPS spectroscopies, powder X-ray diffraction and BET surface area measurements. The utility of the anisotropic TiO2 in photovoltaics and photocatalysis was explored. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the TiO2 showed a conversion efficiency of 6.54% as against 4.8% for a control experiment with the rice-shaped TiO2. The anisotropic TiO2 also showed good photocatalysis in the degradation of methyl orange dye and phenol.
24642612	Tungsten distribution in soil and rice in the vicinity of the world's largest and longest-operating tungsten mine in China.	2014	PLoS One	The objective of this study is to investigate tungsten (W) contamination in soil and its enrichment in rice in the area of the world's largest and longest-operating W mines in China. Root zone soil and rice plants were sampled at 15 sites in the agricultural field adjacent to W mines and analyzed for Al, Fe, Mn, Sc, and W contents and W chemical forms in the soil samples and W contents in the rice root, stem, leaf, and grain samples. Results showed that W content in the soil ranged from 3.99 to 43.7 mg kg(-1), with more than 90% of W in the residual fraction, showing its low mobility and bioavailability. Average W contents in the rice root, stem, leaf, and grain were 7.06, 2.34, 4.76, 0.17 mg kg(-1), respectively. In addition, they were linearly independent of W content and chemical forms in the soil. Average enrichment factor values were 0.39, 0.13, 0.28, and 0.01 for the root, stem, leaf, and grain, respectively. In can be concluded that W mining activity in the Dayu county contaminated the nearby agricultural soil and led to W bioaccumulation in the rice. This may pose a health risk to residents via food and soil ingestion, which should be a focus of scrutiny.
24433490	Elevated production of melatonin in transgenic rice seeds expressing rice tryptophan decarboxylase.	2014	J Pineal Res	A major goal of plant biotechnology is to improve the nutritional qualities of crop plants through metabolic engineering. Melatonin is a well-known bioactive molecule with an array of health-promoting properties, including potent antioxidant capability. To generate melatonin-rich rice plants, we first independently overexpressed three tryptophan decarboxylase isogenes in the rice genome. Melatonin levels were altered in the transgenic lines through overexpression of TDC1, TDC2, and TDC3; TDC3 transgenic seed (TDC3-1) had melatonin concentrations 31-fold higher than those of wild-type seeds. In TDC3 transgenic seedlings, however, only a doubling of melatonin content occurred over wild-type levels. Thus, a seed-specific accumulation of melatonin appears to occur in TDC3 transgenic lines. In addition to increased melatonin content, TDC3 transgenic lines also had enhanced levels of melatonin intermediates including 5-hydroxytryptophan, tryptamine, serotonin, and N-acetylserotonin. In contrast, expression levels of melatonin biosynthetic mRNA did not increase in TDC3 transgenic lines, indicating that increases in melatonin and its intermediates in these lines are attributable exclusively to overexpression of the TDC3 gene.
24633351	Transposon-based high sequence diversity in Avr-Pita alleles increases the potential for pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae populations.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast that is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. Highly variable nature of this fungus has evolved itself against major resistance genes in newly released rice varieties. Understanding the population structure of this fungus is essential for proper utilization of the rice blast resistance genes in rice crop plants. In the present study, we analyzed 133 isolates of M. oryzae from ten countries to find the allelic variation of Avr-Pita gene that is triggering Pita-mediated resistance in rice plant. The diversity analysis of these alleles showed higher level of nucleotide variation in the coding regions than the noncoding regions. Evolutionary analysis of these alleles indicates that Avr-Pita gene is under purifying selection to favor its major alleles in 133 isolates analyzed in this study. We hypothesize that the selection of favorable Avr-Pita allele in these isolates may occur through a genetic mechanism known as recurrent selective sweeps. A total of 22 functional Avr-Pita protein variants were identified in this study. Insertion of Pot3 transposable element into the promoter of Avr-Pita gene was identified in virulent isolates and was suggested that mobility of repeat elements in avirulence genes of M. oryzae seems to help in emergence of new virulent types of the pathogen. Allele-specific markers developed in this study will be helpful to identify a particular type of Avr-Pita allele from M. oryzae population which can form the basis for the deployment of Pita gene in different epidemiological regions.
24414168	Phenotypic and molecular characterization of native Azospirillum strains from rice fields to improve crop productivity.	2014	Protoplasma	Beneficial microorganisms have been considered as an important tool for crop improvement. Native isolates of Azospirillum spp. were obtained from the rhizospheres of different rice fields. Phenotypic, biochemical and molecular characterizations of these isolates led to the identification of six efficient strain of Azospirillum. PCR amplification of the nif genes (nifH, nifD and nifK) and protein profile of Azospirillum strains revealed inter-generic and inter-specific diversity among the strains. In vitro nitrogen fixation performance and the plant growth promotion activities, viz. siderophore, HCN, salicylic acid, IAA, GA, zeatin, ABA, NH3, phosphorus metabolism, ACC deaminase and iron tolerance were found to vary among the Azospirillum strains. The effect of Azospirillum formulations on growth of rice var. Khandagiri under field condition was evaluated, which revealed that the native formulation of Azospirillum of CRRI field (As6) was most effective to elevate endogenous nutrient content, and improved growth and better yield are the result. The 16S rRNA sequence revealed novelty of native Azospirillum lipoferum (As6) (JQ796078) in the NCBI database.
24443494	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Targeted genome modification technologies are key tools for functional genomics. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) is an emerging technology for targeted genome modification. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of a short guide RNA (gRNA), which specifies the target genome sequence, and the Cas9 protein, which has endonuclease activity. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been applied to model animals and flowering plants, including rice, sorghum, wheat, tobacco and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to targeted mutagenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L., which has emerged as a model species for studying land plant evolution. The U6 promoter of M. polymorpha was identified and cloned to express the gRNA. The target sequence of the gRNA was designed to disrupt the gene encoding auxin response factor 1 (ARF1) in M. polymorpha. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we isolated stable mutants in the gametophyte generation of M. polymorpha. CRISPR/Cas9-based site-directed mutagenesis in vivo was achieved using either the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S or M. polymorpha EF1α promoter to express Cas9. Isolated mutant individuals showing an auxin-resistant phenotype were not chimeric. Moreover, stable mutants were produced by asexual reproduction of T1 plants. Multiple arf1 alleles were easily established using CRIPSR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis. Our results provide a rapid and simple approach for molecular genetics in M. polymorpha, and raise the possibility that CRISPR/Cas9 may be applied to a wide variety of plant species.
24451326	The contribution of SERF1 to root-to-shoot signaling during salinity stress in rice.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Stress perception and communication play important roles in the adaptation of plants to changing environmental conditions. Plant roots are the first organs to detect changes in the soil water potential induced by salt stress. In the presence of salinity stress, root-to-shoot communication occurs to adjust the growth of the whole plant. So far, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), hydraulic signals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to mediate this communication under salt stress. Recently, we identified the rice transcription factor SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 (SERF1), which regulates a ROS-dependent transcriptional cascade in roots required for salinity tolerance. Upon salt stress, SERF1 knockout mutant plants show an increased leaf temperature as compared with wild type. As this occurs within the first 20 min of salt stress, we here evaluated the involvement of SERF1 in the perception of salt stress in the shoot. By metabolic profiling and expression analysis we show that the action of SERF1 in signal communication to the shoot is independent from ABA, but does affect the accumulation of ROS-related metabolites and transcripts under short-term salt stress.
24494805	Is diabetes patients' knowledge of laboratory tests for monitoring blood glucose levels associated with better glycaemic control?	2014	Arch Physiol Biochem	AIM: To determine if there is any difference in indices of glycaemic control between type-2 diabetes patients who knew the laboratory tests for monitoring blood glucose and their peers who did not know.

METHODS: Eighty-nine type-2 diabetes patients were studied after an overnight fast. The patients' bio-data, blood pressure, anthropometric indices and baseline biochemical parameters and glycated haemoglobin A₁c (HbA₁c) were measured. After a breakfast of stewed boiled rice, a 2-hour postprandial blood glucose was measured and a questionnaire administered.

RESULTS: The patients' mean ± SD HbA1c level was 8.6 ± 2.4% and none of the patients knew about HbA1c test for monitoring glycaemic control. Interestingly, patients who knew about fasting blood glucose test had significantly lower HbA₁c values than their counterparts who did not know (8.1 ± 2.2 vs. 9.1 ± 2.5%, p < 0.05).

CONCLUSION: Diabetes self-management education incorporating laboratory-based information may assist to prevent poor glycaemic control in developing countries with increasing reports of hyperglycaemic emergencies.
24554344	Deinococcus soli sp. nov., a gamma-radiation-resistant bacterium isolated from rice field soil.	2014	Curr Microbiol	A Gram-negative, non-motile, short rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated N5(T), was isolated from a rice field soil in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the new isolate showed that strain N5(T) belongs to the genus Deinococcus, family Deinococcaceae, showing the highest sequence similarity to Deinococcus grandis KACC 11979(T) (98.4 %) and Deinococcus daejeonensis KCTC 13751(T) (97.5 %). Strain N5(T) exhibits resistance to gamma-radiation similar to that of other members of the genus Deinococcus, with a D10 value in excess of 4 kGy. Chemotaxonomic data showed that the most abundant fatty acids are C16:1ω7c (25.25 %), C15:1ω6c (19.77 %), C17:1ω6c (11.87 %), and C17:0 (9.41 %), and the major polar lipid is an unknown phosphoglycolipid. The predominant respiratory quinone is menaquinone MK-8. The DNA G+C content is 71.4 mol%. Phenotypic, phylogenetic, and chemotaxonomic data support designation of strain N5(T) as a novel species of the genus Deinococcus, for which the name Deinococcus soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is N5(T) (=KCTC 33153(T) = JCM 19176(T)).
24663444	Over-expression of a rice tau class glutathione s-transferase gene improves tolerance to salinity and oxidative stresses in Arabidopsis.	2014	PLoS One	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional proteins encoded by large gene family in plants, which play important role in cellular detoxification of several endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds. Previously, we suggested the diverse roles of rice GST gene family members in plant development and various stress responses based on their differential expression. In this study, we report the functional characterization of a rice tau class GST gene, OsGSTU4. OsGSTU4 fusion protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytoplasm. The over-expression of OsGSTU4 in E. coli resulted in better growth and higher GST activity under various stress conditions. Further, we raised over-expression transgenic Arabidopsis plants to reveal its in planta function. These transgenic lines showed reduced sensitivity towards plant hormones, auxin and abscisic acid. Various analyses revealed improved tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants towards salinity and oxidative stresses, which may be attributed to the lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species and enhanced GST activity. In addition, microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in stress responses and cellular detoxification processes in the transgenic plants as compared to wild-type. These results suggest that OsGSTU4 can be used as a good candidate for the generation of stress-tolerant crop plants.
24374919	Hexanoyl-lysine as a deterioration marker for rice during storage.	2014	Subcell Biochem	N(ε)-(hexanoyl)lysine (HEL) is known to be an oxidative lipid-decomposition product, and a powerful marker indicating oxidative stress in animal tissue. We investigated whether HEL could be useful as a marker in rice seeds damaged by oxidative stress during storage, as well as animals. We could show an accumulation of HEL in rice stored at high temperature (40 °C). This result significantly corresponded with an accumulation of TBARS. Rice germination deteriorated with non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation during storage at high temperature for a few months. These results suggested that a deterioration of rice germination ability resulted from oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation during storage. Moreover, HEL could become a useful marker for oxidative stress induced by lipid peroxidation. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase, significantly decreased in the rice seeds during storage at 40 °C. The relationship between accumulation of HEL and increases in antioxidant enzymes activities must be further studied. But, these results suggest that HEL might be a useful marker of oxidative stress in rice as well as in animals.
24600019	Identification and quantification of phytochelatins in roots of rice to long-term exposure: evidence of individual role on arsenic accumulation and translocation.	2014	J Exp Bot	Rice has the predilection to take up arsenic in the form of methylated arsenic (o-As) and inorganic arsenic species (i-As). Plants defend themselves using i-As efflux systems and the production of phytochelatins (PCs) to complex i-As. Our study focused on the identification and quantification of phytochelatins by HPLC-ICP-MS/ESI-MS, relating them to the several variables linked to As exposure. GSH, 11 PCs, and As-PC complexes from the roots of six rice cultivars (Italica Carolina, Dom Sofid, 9524, Kitrana 508, YRL-1, and Lemont) exposed to low and high levels of i-As were compared with total, i-As, and o-As in roots, shoots, and grains. Only Dom Sofid, Kitrana 508, and 9524 were found to produce higher levels of PCs even when exposed to low levels of As. PCs were only correlated to i-As in the roots (r=0.884, P <0.001). However, significant negative correlations to As transfer factors (TF) roots-grains (r= -0.739, P <0.05) and shoots-grains (r= -0.541, P <0.05), suggested that these peptides help in trapping i-As but not o-As in the roots, reducing grains' i-As. Italica Carolina reduced i-As in grains after high exposure, where some specific PCs had a special role in this reduction. In Lemont, exposure to elevated levels of i-As did not result in higher i-As levels in the grains and there were no significant increases in PCs or thiols. Finally, the high production of PCs in Kitrana 508 and Dom Sofid in response to high As treatment did not relate to a reduction of i-As in grains, suggesting that other mechanisms such as As-PC release and transport seems to be important in determining grain As in these cultivars.
24401405	SPE speciation of inorganic arsenic in rice followed by hydride-generation atomic fluorescence spectrometric quantification.	2014	Talanta	Due to high toxicity, inorganic arsenic (iAs) species are the focus of monitoring effort worldwide. In this work arsenic was first extracted from rice by microwave-assisted digestion in HNO3-H2O2, during which As(III) was oxidized to As(V). Silica-based strong anion exchange cartridges were used to separate As(V) from organic forms. After prereduction by iodide, iAs was quantified by hydride-generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). This method achieved 1.3 ng g(-1) limit of detection (LOD), and 94 ± 3% and 93 ± 5% recoveries, respectively, for As(III) and As(V) at 100 ng g(-1). Validation was performed using standard reference material NIST 1568a (102 ng g(-1)) and ERM BC211 (124 ng g(-1)) rice flour. By eliminating chromatography, SPE speciation gained throughput and cost advantages. HG-AFS, at 10% budget and operation cost of a typical inductively-couple plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS), proved highly sensitive and specific for iAs quantification.
24390243	Identification and characterization of the SET domain gene family in maize.	2014	Mol Biol Rep	Histone lysine methylation plays a pivotal role in a variety of developmental and physiological processes through modifying chromatin structure and thereby regulating eukaryotic gene transcription. The SET domain proteins represent putative candidates for lysine methyltransferases containing the evolutionarily-conserved SET domain, and important epigenetic regulators present in eukaryotes. In recent years, increasing evidence reveals that SET domain proteins are encoded by a large multigene family in plants and investigation of the SET domain gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Although the SET domain gene family has been thoroughly characterized in multiple plant species including two model plant systems, Arabidopsis and rice, through their sequenced genomes, analysis of the entire SET domain gene family in maize was not completed following maize (B73) genome sequencing project. Here, we performed a genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis of maize SET domain genes from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. A complete set of 43 SET domain genes (Zmset1-43) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools and categorized into seven classes (Class I-VII) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on all ten chromosomes with seven segmental duplication events, suggesting that segmental duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize SET domain gene family. EST expression data mining revealed that these newly identified genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and suggested that many maize SET domain genes play functional developmental roles in multiple tissues. Furthermore, the transcripts of the 18 genes (the Class V subfamily) were detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The data demonstrated that these genes exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments. Overall, our study will serve to better understand the complexity of the maize SET domain gene family and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants.
24549114	Development of an ultrasensitive aptasensor for the detection of aflatoxin B1.	2014	Biosens Bioelectron	Contamination of feed and food by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), one of the most toxic of the mycotoxins, is a global concern. To prevent food safety scares, and avoid subsequent economic losses due to the recall of contaminated items, methods for the rapid, sensitive and specific detection of AFB1 at trace levels are much in demand. In this work, a simple, ultrasensitive, and reliable aptasensor is described for the detection of AFB1. An AFB1 aptamer was used as a molecular recognition probe, while its complementary DNA played a role as a signal generator for amplification by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Under optimal conditions, a wide linear detection range (5.0 × 10(-5) to 5.0 ng mL(-1)) was achieved, with a high sensitivity (limit of detection (LOD)=25 fg mL(-1)). In addition, the proposed aptasensor exhibited excellent specificity for AFB1 compared with eight other mycotoxins, with no obvious Ct value change. This aptasensor can also be used in quantifying AFB1 levels in Chinese wild rye hay samples and infant rice cereal samples, demonstrating satisfactory recoveries in the range of 88-127% and 94-119%, respectively. This detection technique has a significant potential for high-throughput, quantitative determination of mycotoxin levels in a large range of feeds and foods.
24504698	The influence of process parameters in production of lipopeptide iturin A using aerated packed bed bioreactors in solid-state fermentation.	2014	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	The strain Bacillus iso 1 co-produces the lipopeptide iturin A and biopolymer poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) in solid-state fermentation of substrate consisting of soybean meal, wheat bran with rice husks as an inert support. The effects of pressure drop, oxygen consumption, medium permeability and temperature profile were studied in an aerated packed bed bioreactor to produce iturin A, diameter of which was 50 mm and bed height 300 mm. The highest concentrations of iturin A and γ-PGA were 5.58 and 3.58 g/kg-dry substrate, respectively, at 0.4 L/min after 96 h of fermentation. The low oxygen uptake rates, being 23.34 and 22.56 mg O2/kg-dry solid substrate for each air flow rate tested generated 5.75 W/kg-dry substrate that increased the fermentation temperature at 3.7 °C. The highest pressure drop was 561 Pa/m at 0.8 L/min in 24 h. This is the highest concentration of iturin A produced to date in an aerated packed bed bioreactor in solid-state fermentation. The results can be useful to design strategies to scale-up process of iturin A in aerated packed bed bioreactors. Low concentration of γ-PGA affected seriously pressure drop, decreasing the viability of the process due to generation of huge pressure gradients with volumetric air flow rates. Also, the low oxygenation favored the iturin A production due to the reduction of free void by γ-PGA production, and finally, the low oxygen consumption generated low metabolic heat. The results show that it must control the pressure gradients to scale-up the process of iturin A production.
24434621	The function and catalysis of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases involved in plant flavonoid biosynthesis.	2014	Int J Mol Sci	Flavonoids are secondary metabolites derived from phenylalanine and acetate metabolism. They fulfil a variety of functions in plants and have health benefits for humans. During the synthesis of the tricyclic flavonoid natural products in plants, oxidative modifications to the central C ring are catalyzed by four of FeII and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (2-ODD) oxygenases, namely flavone synthase I (FNS I), flavonol synthase (FLS), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and flavanone 3β-hydroxylase (FHT). FNS I, FLS and ANS are involved in desaturation of C2-C3 of flavonoids and FHT in hydroxylation of C3. FNS I, which is restricted to the Apiaceae species and in rice, is predicted to have evolved from FHT by duplication. Due to their sequence similarity and substrate specificity, FLS and ANS, which interact with the α surface of the substrate, belong to a group of dioxygenases having a broad substrate specificity, while FNS I and FHT are more selective, and interact with the naringenin β surface. Here, we summarize recent findings regarding the function of the four 2-ODD oxygenases and the relationship between their catalytic activity, their polypeptide sequence and their tertiary structure.
24323625	Salinity acclimation enhances salinity tolerance in tadpoles living in brackish water through increased Na⁺ , K⁺ -ATPase expression.	2014	J Exp Zool A Ecol Genet Physiol	Amphibians are highly susceptible to osmotic stress but, nonetheless, some species can adapt locally to withstand moderately high levels of salinity. Maintaining the homeostasis of body fluids by efficient osmoregulation is thus critical for larval survival in saline environments. We studied the role of acclimation in increased physiological tolerance to elevated water salinity in the Indian rice frog (Fejervarya limnocharis) tadpoles exposed to brackish water. We quantified the effects of salinity acclimation on tadpole survival, osmolality, water content, and gill Na⁺ , K⁺ -ATPase (NKA) expression. Tadpoles did not survive over 12 hr if directly transferred to 11 ppt (parts per thousand) whereas tadpoles previously acclimated for 48 hr in 7  ppt survived at least 48 hr. We reared tadpoles in 3 ppt and then we transferred them to one of (a) 3 ppt, (b) 11  ppt, and (c) 7  ppt for 48 hr and then 11 ppt. In the first 6 hr after transfer to 11 ppt, tadpole osmolality sharply increased and tadpole water content decreased. Tadpoles pre-acclimated for 48 hr in 7 ppt were able to maintain lower and more stable osmolality within the first 3 hr after transfer. These tadpoles initially lost water content, but over the next 6 hr gradually regained water and stabilized. In addition, they had a higher relative abundance of NKA proteins than tadpoles in other treatments. Pre-acclimation to 7 ppt for 48 hr was hence sufficient to activate NKA expression, resulting in increased survivorship and reduced dehydration upon later transfer to 11 ppt. J
24691103	Genome-wide transcriptome modulation in rice transgenic lines expressing engineered mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6.	2014	Plant Signal Behav	Mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) is the central module of MAPK cascade and also point of signal integration and divergence. To investigate the regulatory role of OsMKK6, the regulon of genes controlled by OsMKK6 was constructed by microarray analysis between constitutively activated overexpressing transgenic lines and the wild type rice. Regulated genes were identified in overexpressed constitutively activated OsMKK6 and they were further subdivided on the basis of functional categories, viz. transcription, metabolism, signaling, defense and unknown function. These findings suggest the possible physiological role of OsMKK6 in modulating gene expression and signaling pathways during different stresses.
24587364	Dynamics of potassium release and adsorption on rice straw residue.	2014	PLoS One	Straw application can not only increase crop yields, improve soil structure and enrich soil fertility, but can also enhance water and nutrient retention. The aim of this study was to ascertain the relationships between straw decomposition and the release-adsorption processes of K(+). This study increases the understanding of the roles played by agricultural crop residues in the soil environment, informs more effective straw recycling and provides a method for reducing potassium loss. The influence of straw decomposition on the K(+) release rate in paddy soil under flooded condition was studied using incubation experiments, which indicated the decomposition process of rice straw could be divided into two main stages: (a) a rapid decomposition stage from 0 to 60 d and (b) a slow decomposition stage from 60 to 110 d. However, the characteristics of the straw potassium release were different from those of the overall straw decomposition, as 90% of total K was released by the third day of the study. The batches of the K sorption experiments showed that crop residues could adsorb K(+) from the ambient environment, which was subject to decomposition periods and extra K(+) concentration. In addition, a number of materials or binding sites were observed on straw residues using IR analysis, indicating possible coupling sites for K(+) ions. The aqueous solution experiments indicated that raw straw could absorb water at 3.88 g g(-1), and this rate rose to its maximum 15 d after incubation. All of the experiments demonstrated that crop residues could absorb large amount of aqueous solution to preserve K(+) indirectly during the initial decomposition period. These crop residues could also directly adsorb K(+) via physical and chemical adsorption in the later period, allowing part of this K(+) to be absorbed by plants for the next growing season.
24632997	Development of novel microsatellite markers for the BBCC Oryza genome (Poaceae) using high-throughput sequencing technology.	2014	PLoS One	Wild species of Oryza are extremely valuable sources of genetic material that can be used to broaden the genetic background of cultivated rice, and to increase its resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Until recently, there was no sequence information for the BBCC Oryza genome; therefore, no special markers had been developed for this genome type. The lack of suitable markers made it difficult to search for valuable genes in the BBCC genome. The aim of this study was to develop microsatellite markers for the BBCC genome. We obtained 13,991 SSR-containing sequences and designed 14,508 primer pairs. The most abundant was hexanuclelotide (31.39%), followed by trinucleotide (27.67%) and dinucleotide (19.04%). 600 markers were selected for validation in 23 accessions of Oryza species with the BBCC genome. A set of 495 markers produced clear amplified fragments of the expected sizes. The average number of alleles per locus (Na) was 2.5, ranging from 1 to 9. The genetic diversity per locus (He) ranged from 0 to 0.844 with a mean of 0.333. The mean polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.290, and ranged from 0 to 0.825. Of the 495 markers, 12 were only found in the BB genome, 173 were unique to the CC genome, and 198 were also present in the AA genome. These microsatellite markers could be used to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among different Oryza genomes, and to construct a genetic linkage map for locating and identifying valuable genes in the BBCC genome, and would also for marker-assisted breeding programs that included accessions with the AA genome, especially Oryza sativa.
24557528	Geochemical variability of heavy metals in soil after land use conversions in Northeast China and its environmental applications.	2014	Environ Sci Process Impacts	The long-term agricultural reclamation since the 1950s has resulted in significant land use change from natural landscape to cultivated land in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China, which has had important consequences for many soil physical, chemical and biological processes. To understand the impact of land use conversions on heavy metal geochemistry, soil samples were collected from natural wetland, natural forestland, paddy land and dry farmland in a case study area and analyzed for total concentrations and chemical fractions of six heavy metals. Results showed that the natural wetland reclamation for the paddy land has caused obvious losses of Cd, Cu and Zn from the soils. In addition, a significant decrease in the Zn concentration was found after the land conversion from natural forestland to dry farmland. Because all the analyzed heavy metals predominated in the stable residual fraction regardless of the land use type, the response of metal mobility to the land use conversions was generally weak. Consequently, soil erosion was identified as the major factor that enhances heavy metal losses in the cultivated lands, especially in the paddy land. The close link between heavy metal loss and the reduction of clay and organic matter contents after land reclamation suggested that the diffuse heavy metal pollution occurred mainly in small erosion events. Considering the continuous paddy land expansion, special attention should be paid to the bioaccumulation of Pb in the paddy rice. Overall, these findings can help to improve the sustainability and safety of intensive agricultural activities in Northeast China as well as other similar areas.
24571270	An increase in melatonin in transgenic rice causes pleiotropic phenotypes, including enhanced seedling growth, delayed flowering, and low grain yield.	2014	J Pineal Res	No previous reports have described the effects of an increase in endogenous melatonin levels on plant yield and reproduction. Here, the phenotypes of melatonin-rich transgenic rice plants overexpressing sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase were investigated under field conditions. Early seedling growth of melatonin-rich transgenic rice was greatly accelerated, with enhanced biomass relative to the wild type (WT). However, flowering was delayed by 1 wk in the transgenic lines compared with the WT. Grain yields of the melatonin-rich transgenic lines were reduced by 33% on average. Other phenotypes also varied among the transgenic lines. For example, the transgenic line S1 exhibited greater height and biomass than the WT, while the S10 transgenic line showed diminished height and an increase in panicle numbers per plant. The expression levels of Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) and TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (TB1) genes, two key regulators of meristem initiation and maintenance, were not altered in the transgenic lines. These data demonstrate that an alteration of endogenous melatonin levels leads to pleiotropic effects such as height, biomass, panicle number, flowering time, and grain yield, indicating that melatonin behaves as a signaling molecule in plant growth and reproduction.
24274014	Flanking sequence determination and specific PCR identification of transgenic wheat B102-1-2.	2014	Prep Biochem Biotechnol	The exogenous fragment sequence and flanking sequence between the exogenous fragment and recombinant chromosome of transgenic wheat B102-1-2 were successfully acquired using genome walking technology. The newly acquired exogenous fragment encoded the full-length sequence of transformed genes with transformed plasmid and corresponding functional genes including ubi, vector pBANF-bar, vector pUbiGUSPlus, vector HSP, reporter vector pUbiGUSPlus, promoter ubiquitin, and coli DH1. A specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification method for transgenic wheat B102-1-2 was established on the basis of designed primers according to flanking sequence. This established specific PCR strategy was validated by using transgenic wheat, transgenic corn, transgenic soybean, transgenic rice, and non-transgenic wheat. A specifically amplified target band was observed only in transgenic wheat B102-1-2. Therefore, this method is characterized by high specificity, high reproducibility, rapid identification, and excellent accuracy for the identification of transgenic wheat B102-1-2.
24561073	An ecological study of Bithynia snails, the first intermediate host of Opisthorchis viverrini in northeast Thailand.	2015	Acta Trop	Infection with the food-borne trematodiasis, liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, is a major public health concern in Southeast Asia. While epidemiology and parasitic incidence in humans are well studied, ecological information on the O. viverrini intermediate hosts remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the distribution and abundance of the first intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos snails. Water quality and snails were sampled in 31 sites in Muang District, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand from June 2012 to January 2013 to characterize the B.s. goniomphalos snail habitats. Species relative abundance and Shannon's diversity and evenness indices were employed to describe snail compositions and diversities across different habitat types. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the extent to which the water quality variables and species interactions account for the relative abundance of B.s. goniomphalos snails. The results showed that the freshwater habitats of ponds, streams and rice paddies possessed significantly different abiotic water qualities, with water temperature and pH showing distinct statistical differences (P<0.05). Different habitats had different snail diversity and species evenness, with high B.s. goniomphalos snail abundance at rice paddy habitats. The differences in snail abundance might be due to the distinct sets of abiotic water qualities associated with each habitat types. The relative abundance of B.s. goniomphalos snails was found to be negatively correlated with that of Filopaludina martensi martensi snails (r=-0.46, P<0.05), underscoring the possible influence of species interaction on B.s. goniomphalos snail population. Field work observations revealed that rice planting seasons and irrigation could regulate snail population dynamics at rice paddy habitats. This study provides new ecological insights into the factors affecting Bithynia snail distribution and abundance. It bridges the knowledge gap in O. viverrini disease ecology and highlights the potential effect of anthropogenic irrigation practices on B.s. goniomphalos snail ecology.
24626216	Refolding of β-stranded class I chitinases of Hippophae rhamnoides enhances the antifreeze activity during cold acclimation.	2014	PLoS One	Class I chitinases hydrolyse the β-1,4-linkage of chitin and also acquire antifreeze activity in some of the overwintering plants during cold stress. Two chitinases, HrCHT1a of 31 kDa and HrCHT1b of 34 kDa, were purified from cold acclimated and non-acclimated seabuckthorn seedlings using chitin affinity chromatography. 2-D gels of HrCHT1a and HrCHT1b showed single spots with pIs 7.0 and 4.6 respectively. N-terminal sequence of HrCHT1b matched with the class I chitinase of rice and antifreeze proteins while HrCHT1a could not be sequenced as it was N-terminally blocked. Unlike previous reports, where antifreeze activity of chitinase was cold inducible, our results showed that antifreeze activity is constitutive property of class I chitinase as both HrCHT1a and HrCHT1b isolated even from non-acclimated seedlings, exhibited antifreeze activity. Interestingly, HrCHT1a and HrCHT1b purified from cold acclimated seedlings, exhibited 4 and 2 times higher antifreeze activities than those purified from non-acclimated seedlings, suggesting that antifreeze activity increased during cold acclimation. HrCHT1b exhibited 23-33% higher hydrolytic activity and 2-4 times lower antifreeze activity than HrCHT1a did. HrCHT1b was found to be a glycoprotein; however, its antifreeze activity was independent of glycosylation as even deglycosylated HrCHT1b exhibited antifreeze activity. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed that both these chitinases were rich in unusual β-stranded conformation (36-43%) and the content of β-strand increased (∼11%) during cold acclimation. Surprisingly, calcium decreased both the activities of HrCHT1b while in case of HrCHT1a, a decrease in the hydrolytic activity and enhancement in its antifreeze activity was observed. CD results showed that addition of calcium also increased the β-stranded conformation of HrCHT1a and HrCHT1b. This is the first report, which shows that antifreeze activity is constitutive property of class I chitinase and cold acclimation and calcium regulate these activities of chitinases by changing the secondary structure.
24446340	Correlation analysis between starch properties and single nucleotide polymorphisms of waxy genes in common rye (Secale cereale L.).	2014	Genet Mol Res	To understand the relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the waxy gene and starch parameters in common rye, we performed sequence characterization, enzyme activity testing, amylopectin/amylose ratio evaluation, starch property testing, and correlation analysis. Specific primers were used to clone waxy from 20 rye cultivars. Sequence analysis showed that waxy was 2852 bp, including 11 exons, and sequence similarity across the 20 cultivars was over 98%. The Waxy protein showed >95% similarity with those from wheat, rice, and barley, the closest genetic relationship being with wheat Wx-A type. Waxy had multiple SNPs, most of which were located in the exons. Amino acid variants were found to be mainly distributed in the catalytic domain in an imbalanced state. Multi-factor correlation analysis revealed significant correlation among starch pasting parameters in rye flour. The Waxy protein activity was significantly negatively correlated with the amylose content and amylopectin/amylose ratio. However, pasting parameters, Waxy enzyme activity, and amylopectin/amylose content ratio were not correlated. The correlation of SNPs, the key catalytic site of Waxy, with starch parameters and enzyme activity suggested that both starch pasting parameters and Waxy protein activity were influenced by No. 260 amino acid (aa). Further, the 141 and 152 aa loci were found in the enzyme-catalyzing domain of Waxy. Interestingly, Waxy enzyme activity was also influenced by the 363 aa locus in the pliable region. These results provide important theoretical regarding the high-throughput quality identification of noodle starch, functional studies, directional selection, and molecular markers of wheat Wx subunits.
24509730	Genetic control of rhizomes and genomic localization of a major-effect growth habit QTL in perennial wildrye.	2014	Mol Genet Genomics	Rhizomes are prostrate subterranean stems that provide primitive mechanisms of vegetative dispersal, survival, and regrowth of perennial grasses and other monocots. The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens).
24678507	Characterization of H3PO4-treated rice husk adsorbent and adsorption of copper(II) from aqueous solution.	2014	Biomed Res Int	Rice husk, a surplus agricultural byproduct, was applied to the sorption of copper from aqueous solutions. Chemical modifications by treating rice husk with H3PO4 increased the sorption ability of rice husk for Cu(II). This work investigated the sorption characteristics for Cu(II) and examined the optimum conditions of the sorption processes. The elemental compositions of native rice husk and H3PO4-treated rice husk were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was carried out for structural and morphological characteristics of H3PO4-treated rice husk. The surface functional groups (i.e., carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl) of adsorbent were examined by Fourier Transform Infrared Technique (FT-IR) and contributed to the adsorption for Cu(II). Adsorption isotherm experiments were carried out at room temperature and the data obtained from batch studies fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich models with R (2) of 0.999 and 0.9303, respectively. The maximum sorption amount was 17.0358 mg/g at a dosage of 2 g/L after 180 min. The results showed that optimum pH was attained at pH 4.0. The equilibrium data was well represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The percentage removal for Cu(II) approached equilibrium at 180 min with 88.9% removal.
24597823	Gene expression related to seed shattering and the cell wall in cultivated and weedy rice.	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Seed shattering is an evolutionary trait that is essential to the survival of wild and weedy rice. Discovery of the qSH1 gene in rice subspecies Japonica and Sh4 in the rice subspecies Indica indicated the possibility that seed shattering is governed by major genes in a qualitative manner. However, observation of the large variability of seed shattering in weedy rice has led us to hypothesise that other genes related to abscission layer integrity could also be important in the regulation of seed shattering in rice. Gene expression 10 days after pollination and nucleotide composition revealed that qSH1 and Sh4 that are described as major players in seed shattering were not important in weedy rice. High expression of the gene OsCPL1 was positively associated with the occurrence of high seed shattering in weedy rice, which did not concur in previous studies of cultivated rice. This result is related to the absence of four SNPs and an indel in the OsCPL1 gene in weedy rice that are related to seed shattering in previous studies. Analysis of the expression of six genes related to cell wall synthesis/degradation revealed the importance of the genes OsXTH8 and OsCel9D in seed shattering in weedy rice. Therefore, in addition to qSH1 and Sh4, the genes OsCPL1, OsXTH8 and OsCel9D should be considered in studies of rice evolution and in the development of mitigation approaches of gene flow in transgenic rice.
24136530	Analysis of rice proteins using SDS-PAGE shotgun proteomics.	2014	Methods Mol Biol	In this chapter we describe the workflow used in our laboratory to analyze rice leaf samples using label-free shotgun proteomics based on SDS-PAGE fractionation of proteins. Rice proteomics has benefitted substantially from successful execution of shotgun proteomics techniques. We describe steps on how to proceed starting from rice protein extraction, SDS-PAGE, in-gel protein digestion with trypsin, nanoLC-MS/MS, and database searching using the GPM. Data from these experiments can be used for spectral counting, where simultaneous quantitation of several thousand proteins can be obtained.
24482190	Cadmium and lead interactive effects on oxidative stress and antioxidative responses in rice seedlings.	2014	Protoplasma	Interactive effects of two heavy metal pollutants Cd and Pb in the growth medium were examined on their uptake, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of oxidative stress and antioxidative defence responses in Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. When rice seedlings in sand culture were exposed to 150 μM Cd (NO3)2 or 600 μM Pb (CH3COO)2 individually or in combination for 8-16 days, a significant reduction in root/shoot length, fresh weight, relative water content, photosynthetic pigments and increased production of ROS (O2˙- and H2O2) was observed. Both Cd and Pb were readily taken up by rice roots and localisation of absorbed metals was greater in roots than in shoots. When present together in the growth medium, uptake of both the metals Cd and Pb declined by 25-40%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging of leaf stomata revealed that Pb caused more distortion in the shape of guard cells than Cd. Dithizone staining of roots showed localisation of absorbed Cd on root hairs and epidermal cells. Both Cd and Pb caused increased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, decline in protein thiol and increase in non-protein thiol. The level of reduced forms of non-enzymic antioxidants glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA) and their redox ratios (GSH/AsA) declined, whereas the activities of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) increased in metal treated seedlings compared to controls. In-gel activity staining also revealed increased intensities of SOD and GPX isoforms with metal treatments. Catalase (CAT) activity increased during early days (8 days) of metal exposure and declined by 16 days. Results suggest that oxidative stress is an important component in expression of Cd and Pb toxicities in rice, though uptake of both metals gets reduced considerably when present together in the medium.
24520156	A positive feedback loop between HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN modulates long-term acquired thermotolerance illustrating diverse heat stress responses in rice varieties.	2014	Plant Physiol	Heat stress is an important factor that has a negative impact on rice (Oryza sativa) production. To alleviate this problem, it is necessary to extensively understand the genetic basis of heat tolerance and adaptability to heat stress in rice. Here, we report the molecular mechanism underlying heat acclimation memory that confers long-term acquired thermotolerance (LAT) in this monocot plant. Our results showed that a positive feedback loop formed by two heat-inducible genes, HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101 (HSP101) and HEAT STRESS-ASSOCIATED 32-KD PROTEIN (HSA32), at the posttranscriptional level prolongs the effect of heat acclimation in rice seedlings. The interplay between HSP101 and HSA32 also affects basal thermotolerance of rice seeds. These findings are similar to those reported for the dicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), suggesting a conserved function in plant heat stress response. Comparison between two rice cultivars, japonica Nipponbare and indica N22 showed opposite performance in basal thermotolerance and LAT assays. 'N22' seedlings have a higher basal thermotolerance level than cv Nipponbare and vice versa at the LAT level, indicating that these two types of thermotolerance can be decoupled. The HSP101 and HSA32 protein levels were substantially higher in cv Nipponbare than in cv N22 after a long recovery following heat acclimation treatment, at least partly explaining the difference in the LAT phenotype. Our results point out the complexity of thermotolerance diversity in rice cultivars, which may need to be taken into consideration when breeding for heat tolerance for different climate scenarios.
24646013	Collision dynamics of protonated N-acetylmethionine with singlet molecular oxygen (a(1)Δg): the influence of the amide bond and ruling out the complex-mediated mechanism at low energies.	2014	J Phys Chem B	It has been proposed (J. Phys. Chem. B 2011, 115, 2671) that the ammonium group is involved in the gas-phase reaction of protonated methionine (MetH(+)) with singlet oxygen (1)O2, yielding hydrogen peroxide and a dehydro compound of MetH(+) where the -NH3(+) transforms into cyclic -NH2-. For the work reported, the gas-phase reaction of protonated N-acetylmethionine (Ac-MetH(+)) with (1)O2 was examined, including the measurements of reaction products and cross sections over a center-of-mass collision energy (Ecol) range from 0.05 to 1.0 eV using a guided-ion-beam apparatus. The aim is to probe how the acetylation of the ammonium group affects the oxidation chemistry of the ensuing Ac-MetH(+). Properties of intermediates, transition states, and products along the reaction coordinate were explored using density functional theory calculations and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) modeling. Direct dynamics trajectory simulations were carried out at Ecol of 0.05 and 0.1 eV using the B3LYP/4-31G(d) level of theory. In contrast to the highly efficient reaction of MetH(+) + (1)O2, the reaction of Ac-MetH(+) + (1)O2 is extremely inefficient, despite there being exoergic pathways. Two product channels were observed, corresponding to transfer of two H atoms from Ac-MetH(+) to (1)O2 (H2T), and methyl elimination (ME) from a sulfone intermediate complex. Both channels are inhibited by collision energies, becoming negligible at Ecol > 0.2 eV. Analysis of RRKM and trajectory results suggests that a complex-mediated mechanism might be involved at very low Ecol, but direct, nonreactive collisions prevail over the entire Ecol range and physical quenching of (1)O2 occurs during the early stage of collisions.
24616556	Computational analyses of protein coded by rice (Oryza sativa japonica) cDNA (GI: 32984786) indicate lectin like Ca(2+) binding properties for Eicosapenta Peptide Repeats (EPRs).	2014	Bioinformation	Eicosapenta peptide repeats (EPRs) occur exclusively in flowering plant genomes and exhibit very high amino acid residue conservation across occurrence. DNA and amino acid sequence searches yielded no indications about the function due to absence of similarity to known sequences. Tertiary structure of an EPR protein coded by rice (Oryza sativa japonica) cDNA (GI: 32984786) was determined based on ab initio methodology in order to draw clues on functional significance of EPRs. The resultant structure comprised of seven α-helices and thirteen anti-parallel β-sheets. Surface-mapping of conserved residues onto the structure deduced that (i) regions equivalent to β α4- the primary function of EPR protein could be Ca(2+) binding, and (iii) the putative EPR Ca(2+) binding domain is structurally similar to calcium-binding domains of plant lectins. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis showed an evolving taxa-specific distribution of EPR proteins observed in some GNA-like lectins.
24586634	Geographic variation in sexual attraction of Spodoptera frugiperda corn- and rice-strain males to pheromone lures.	2014	PLoS One	The corn- and rice-strains of Spodoptera frugiperda exhibit several genetic and behavioral differences and appear to be undergoing ecological speciation in sympatry. Previous studies reported conflicting results when investigating male attraction to pheromone lures in different regions, but this could have been due to inter-strain and/or geographic differences. Therefore, we investigated whether corn- and rice-strain males differed in their response to different synthetic pheromone blends in different regions in North America, the Caribbean and South America. All trapped males were strain-typed by two strain-specific mitochondrial DNA markers. In the first experiment, we found a nearly similar response of corn- and rice-strain males to two different 4-component blends, resembling the corn- and rice-strain female blend we previously described from females in Florida. This response showed some geographic variation in fields in Canada, North Carolina, Florida, Puerto Rico, and South America (Peru, Argentina). In dose-response experiments with the critical secondary sex pheromone component (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate (Z7-12:OAc), we found some strain-specific differences in male attraction. While the response to Z7-12:OAc varied geographically in the corn-strain, rice-strain males showed almost no variation. We also found that the minor compound (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:OAc) did not increase attraction of both strains in Florida and of corn-strain males in Peru. In a fourth experiment, where we added the stereo-isomer of the critical sex pheromone component, (E)-7-dodecenyl acetate, to the major pheromone component (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14:OAc), we found that this compound was attractive to males in North Carolina, but not to males in Peru. Overall, our results suggest that both strains show rather geographic than strain-specific differences in their response to pheromone lures, and that regional sexual communication differences might cause geographic differentiation between populations.
24506331	A restorer-of-fertility like pentatricopeptide repeat gene directs ribonucleolytic processing within the coding sequence of rps3-rpl16 and orf240a mitochondrial transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana.	2014	Plant J	The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins represent a large family of RNA-binding proteins that have many roles in post-transcriptional RNA processes within plant organelles. Among the PPR proteins that target plant mitochondria, the restorer-of-fertility (Rf) proteins are characterized by their inhibitory action on mitochondrion-localized cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes in various crop species. Close homologs to known Rfs from radish, petunia, and rice can be identified in most higher plant species and these proteins define the recognized subgroup of Rf-like (RFL) PPR proteins. In this paper we describe the function of the RFL9 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, and show that it is associated with ribonucleolytic cleavages within the coding sequences of rps3-rpl16 and orf240a mitochondrial transcripts in the Col-0 accession. RFL9 therefore represents an Rf-like PPR gene that has the potential to compromise the function of an essential mitochondrial gene and whose function is also associated with a mitochondrial orf sharing significant homology with a proven CMS-causing orf. We observe that RFL9 is active in only a few Arabidopsis accessions genetically close to Col-0, which supports the idea that the genetic fixation of this gene represents a regional event in the recent evolution of Arabidopsis. Additionally, RFL9 counts among the RFL genes that are probably controlled by short regulatory RNAs, and our results provides a potential explanation for such control, which in the case of RFL9 might have evolved to limit its detrimental effect on rps3 expression.
24670252	Relationships between starch synthase I and branching enzyme isozymes determined using double mutant rice lines.	2014	BMC Plant Biol	BACKGROUND: Starch is the most important carbohydrate in plant storage tissues. Multiple isozymes in at least four enzyme classes are involved in starch biosynthesis. Some of these isozymes are thought to interact and form complexes for efficient starch biosynthesis. Of these enzyme classes, starch synthases (SSs) and branching enzymes (BEs) play particularly central roles.

RESULTS: We generated double mutant lines (ss1/be1 and ss1L/be2b) between SSI (the largest component of total soluble SS activity) and BEI or BEIIb (major BEs in developing rice endosperm) to explore the relationships among these isozymes. The seed weight of ss1/be1 was comparable to that of wild type, although most ss1/be2b seeds were sterile and no double recessive plants were obtained. The seed weight of the double recessive mutant line ss1L/be2b, derived from the leaky ss1 mutant (ss1L) and be2b, was higher than that of the single be2b mutant. Analyses of the chain-length distribution of amylopectin in ss1/be1 endosperm revealed additive effects of SSI and BEI on amylopectin structure. Chain-length analysis indicated that the BEIIb deficiency significantly reduced the ratio of short chains in amylopectin of ss1L/be2b. The amylose content of endosperm starch of ss1/be1 and ss1L/be2b was almost the same as that of wild type, whereas the endosperm starch of be2b contained more amylose than did that of wild type. SSI, BEI, and BEIIb deficiency also affected the extent of binding of other isozymes to starch granules.

CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the chain-length distribution in amylopectin of the double mutant lines showed that SSI and BEI or BEIIb primarily function independently, and branching by BEIIb is followed by SSI chain elongation. The increased amylose content in be2b was because of reduced amylopectin biosynthesis; however, the lower SSI activity in this background may have enhanced amylopectin biosynthesis as a result of a correction of imbalance between the branching and elongation found in the single mutant. The fact that a deficiency of SSI, BEI, or BEIIb affected the affinity of other starch biosynthetic isozymes for the starch granule implies that there is a close interaction among SSI, BEI and BEIIb during amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm.
24625596	Ab initio study of H, He, Li and Be impurity effect in tungsten Σ3{1 1 2} and Σ27{5 5 2} grain boundaries.	2014	J Phys Condens Matter	Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the effect of H, He, Li and Be impurities on the intergranular cohesion of W Σ3〈1 1 0〉{1 1 2} and Σ27〈1 1 0〉{5 5 2} grain boundaries (GBs). A rigorous search of unique interstices was performed to reveal a range of impurity behaviors. It was found that He exhibits the largest defect formation energy, however it is Li that shows the strongest tendency to segregate towards the GBs. The embrittling potency was studied using the ideal GB fracture energy (Rice-Wang) criterion (Rice and Wang 1989 Mater. Sci. Eng. A 107 23). The potency was found to depend significantly on the local atomic environment. A site-dependent concentration was used as the weighing factor to obtain an average potency as a function of temperature. It was found that the potency depends only weakly on temperature. In Σ3 H, He, Li and Be decrease fracture energy by 4%, 27%, 30% and 14%, respectively. In Σ27 H, He and Li also decrease cohesion, albeit less severely: 3%, 14% and 7%. On the other hand, Be increases cohesion in Σ27 by 3%.
24678922	Discovery and mechanistic studies of facile N-terminal Cα-C bond cleavages in the dissociation of tyrosine-containing peptide radical cations.	2014	J Phys Chem B	Fascinating N-terminal Cα-C bond cleavages in a series of nonbasic tyrosine-containing peptide radical cations have been observed under low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID), leading to the generation of rarely observed x-type radical fragments, with significant abundances. CID experiments of the radical cations of the alanyltyrosylglycine tripeptide and its analogues suggested that the N-terminal Cα-C bond cleavage, yielding its [x2 + H](•+) radical cation, does not involve an N-terminal α-carbon-centered radical. Theoretical examination of a prototypical radical cation of the alanyltyrosine dipeptide, using density functional theory calculations, suggested that direct N-terminal Cα-C bond cleavage could produce an ion-molecule complex formed between the incipient a1(+) and x1(•) fragments. Subsequent proton transfer from the iminium nitrogen atom in a1(+) to the acyl carbon atom in x1(•) results in the observable [x1 + H](•+). The barriers against this novel Cα-C bond cleavage and the competitive N-Cα bond cleavage, forming the complementary [c1 + 2H](+)/[z1 - H](•+) ion pair, are similar (ca. 16 kcal mol(-1)). Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus modeling revealed that [x1 + H](•+) and [c1 + 2H](+) species are formed with comparable rates, in agreement with energy-resolved CID experiments for [AY](•+).
24634590	Effects of an injury and illness prevention program on occupational safety behaviors among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand.	2014	Risk Manag Healthc Policy	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an Injury and Illness Prevention (IIP) program intervention on occupational safety behavior among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. This was a quasi-experimental study in an intervention group and a control group. It was carried out in two rice farming communities, in which most people are rice farmers with similar socio-demographic characteristics. Multistage sampling was employed, selecting one person per rice farming household. The intervention group was 62 randomly selected rice farmers living in a rural area; another 55 rice farmers served as the control group. A structured face-to-face interview questionnaire was administered to participants to evaluate their safety behaviors in four areas: equipment use, pesticide use, ergonomics, and working conditions. The 2-week intervention program consisted of four elements: 1) health education, 2) safety inspection, 3) safety communication, and 4) health surveillance. Data were collected at baseline and 4 months after the intervention (follow-up). We used a general linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance to assess the mean difference between baseline and follow-up occupational safety behavior points between the intervention and control groups. Pesticide safety behaviors significantly increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. Ergonomics and working conditions points also increased in the intervention group, but not significantly so. The equipment use score decreased in the intervention group. It is necessary to identify and develop further measures to improve occupational safety behaviors. Some methods, such as effective risk communication, could be added to increase risk perception.
24478940	TPS1 drug design for rice blast disease in magnaporthe oryzae.	2014	Springerplus	Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is a fungal pathogen and the causal agent of rice blast disease. Previous lipidomics analysis of M. oryzae demonstrated that trehalose, a carbohydrate common to various fungi and algae, is thought to be involved in the possible conversion of glycogen into triacylglycerides for energy, an important step in the pathogenesis of M. oryzae. A key enzyme responsible for trehalose synthesis is trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (Tps1). Therefore, we modeled the structure of Tps1 and sought to screen a chemical database in silico for possible inhibitors of the enzyme. Based on homologous alignment and sequence analysis, we first modeled the structure of Tps1 to determine the potential active site of the enzyme and its conformation. Using this model, we then undertook a docking study to determine the potential interaction that would manifest between Tsp1 and potential chemical inhibitors. Of the 400,000 chemicals screened in the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, we identified 45 potential candidates. The best candidate (Compound 24789937) was chosen and subjected to various structural optimization techniques to improve the suitability of the potential chemical inhibitors at the docking site of Tps1. From these modified versions of Compound 24789937, one lead compound (Lead 25) was shown to have the best binding affinity to Tps1 and good water solubility as compared with the ideal template compound and the other 44 potential candidates. Molecular dynamics simulation further confirmed the strength of the Tps1-Lead 25 complex and indicated the potential for Lead 25 to be used as an inhibitor of Tps1 in the control of M. oryzae-mediated rice blast disease.
24594398	Promotion of photosynthesis in transgenic rice over-expressing of maize C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene by nitric oxide donors.	2014	J Plant Physiol	We determined the effects of exogenous nitric oxide on photosynthesis and gene expression in transgenic rice plants (PC) over-expressing the maize C4pepc gene, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). Seedlings were subjected to treatments with NO donors, an NO scavenger, phospholipase inhibitors, a Ca(2+) chelator, a Ca(2+) channel inhibitor, and a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inhibitor, individually and in various combinations. The NO donors significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate (PN) of PC and wild-type (WT), especially that of PC. Treatment with an NO scavenger did inhibit the PN of rice plants. The treatments with phospholipase inhibitors and a Ca(2+) chelator decreased the PN of WT and PC, and photosynthesis was more strongly inhibited in WT than in PC. Further analyses showed that the NO donors increased endogenous levels of NO and PLD activity, but decreased endogenous levels of Ca(2+) both WT and PC. However, there was a greater increase in NO in WT and a greater increase in PLD activity and Ca(2+) level in PC. The NO donors also increased both PEPC activity and pepc gene expression in PC. PEPC activity can be increased by SNP alone. But the expression of its encoding gene in PC might be regulated by SNP, together with PA and Ca(2+).
24673767	Characterization of the caleosin gene family in the Triticeae.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: The caleosin genes encode proteins with a single conserved EF hand calcium-binding domain and comprise small gene families found in a wide range of plant species. Some members of the gene family have been shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses including low water availability and high salinity. Caleosin 3 from wheat has been shown to interact with the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins, and to act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP). This study characterizes the size and diversity of the gene family in wheat and related species and characterizes the differential tissue-specific expression of members of the gene family.

RESULTS: A total of 34 gene family members that belong to eleven paralogous groups of caleosins were identified in the hexaploid bread wheat, T. aestivum. Each group was represented by three homeologous copies of the gene located on corresponding homeologous chromosomes, except the caleosin 10, which has four gene copies. Ten gene family members were identified in diploid barley, Hordeum vulgare, and in rye, Secale cereale, seven in Brachypodium distachyon, and six in rice, Oryza sativa. The analysis of gene expression was assayed in triticale and rye by RNA-Seq analysis of 454 sequence sets and members of the gene family were found to have diverse patterns of gene expression in the different tissues that were sampled in rye and in triticale, the hybrid hexaploid species derived from wheat and rye. Expression of the gene family in wheat and barley was also previously determined by microarray analysis, and changes in expression during development and in response to environmental stresses are presented.

CONCLUSIONS: The caleosin gene family had a greater degree of expansion in the Triticeae than in the other monocot species, Brachypodium and rice. The prior implication of one member of the gene family in the stress response and heterotrimeric G protein signaling, points to the potential importance of the caleosin gene family. The complexity of the family and differential expression in various tissues and under conditions of abiotic stress suggests the possibility that caleosin family members may play diverse roles in signaling and development that warrants further investigation.
24590240	Characterization of a β-1,4-mannanase from a newly isolated strain of Pholiota adiposa and its application for biomass pretreatment.	2014	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	A highly efficient β-1,4-mannanase-secreting strain, Pholiota adiposa SKU0714, was isolated and identified on the basis of its morphological features and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. P. adiposa β-1,4-mannanase was purified to homogeneity from P. adiposa culture supernatants by one-step chromatography on a Sephacryl gel filtration column. P. adiposa β-1,4-mannanase showed the highest activity toward locust bean gum (V max = 1,990 U/mg protein, K m = 0.12 mg/mL) ever reported. Its internal amino acid sequence showed homology with hydrolases from the glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5), indicating that the enzyme is a member of the GH5 family. The saccharification of commercial mannanase and P. adiposa β-1,4-mannanase-pretreated rice straw by Celluclast 1.5L (Novozymes) was compared. In comparison with the commercial Novo Mannaway(®) (113 mg/g-substrate), P. adiposa β-1,4-mannanase-pretreated rice straw released more reducing sugars (141 mg/g-substrate). These properties make P. adiposa β-1,4-mannanase a good candidate as a new commercial β-1,4-mannanase to improve biomass pretreatment.
24530725	Accumulation and toxicological response of atrazine in rice crops.	2014	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Atrazine is one of the most widely used herbicides for controlling weeds and grasses. Due to its intensive use, it has become a serious contaminant in soil and water. To evaluate impact of atrazine on graminaceous crops, experiments focusing on atrazine accumulation and toxic response in rice (Oryza sativa) were carried out. Treatment with atrazine at 0.05-0.8 mg L(-1) for 6 d reduced elongation of shoot and root. Compared with a mock treatment, the elongation of shoot with atrazine was 67.1 percent of the control, whereas that of root was 79.5 percent, indicating that the shoot was more affected than the root. Atrazine was readily absorbed by rice from media. Although the quantitative absorption of atrazine was positively correlated with the external supply of the herbicide, translocation of atrazine from roots to the above-ground was reduced from 39.88±6.26 (at 0.05 mg L(-1)) to 9.25±0.27 (0.8 mg L(-1)). While accumulation of atrazine in rice plants led to toxic responses such as over-generation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions, it triggered the plant defense system against the herbicide-induced oxidative stress. This was best presented by the enhanced activities of several antioxidant enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) and expression of genes responsible for the tolerance to atrazine toxicity.
24588385	Changes in the proteome of the cadmium-tolerant bacteria Cupriavidus taiwanensis KKU2500-3 in response to cadmium toxicity.	2014	Can J Microbiol	Cupriavidus taiwanensis KKU2500-3 is a cadmium (Cd)-tolerant bacterial strain that was previously isolated from rice fields contaminated with high levels of Cd. In 500 μmol/L CdCl2, the KKU2500-3 strain grew slower and with a more prolonged lag-phase than when grown in the absence of Cd. A proteomic approach was used to characterize the protein expression in the Cd-tolerant bacteria C. taiwanensis KKU2500-3 during growth under Cd stress. When compared with the untreated cells, a total of 982 differentially expressed protein spots were observed in the CdCl2-treated cells, and 59 and 10 spots exhibited >2- and >4-fold changes, respectively. The level of up- and downregulation varied from 2.01- to 11.26-fold and from 2.01- to 5.34-fold, respectively. Of the 33 differentially expressed protein spots analyzed by MALDI TOF MS/MS, 19 spots were successfully identified, many of which were involved in stress responses. The most highly upregulated protein (+7.95-fold) identified was the chaperone GroEL, which indicated that this factor likely contributed to the bacterial survival and growth in response to Cd toxicity. Detection of the downregulated protein flagellin (-3.52-fold) was consistent with the less effective ATP-mediated and flagella-driven motility. The flagella-losing cells were also observed in the Cd-treated bacteria when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the Cd-stressed cells may downregulate pathways involving ATP utilization in favor of other mechanisms in response to Cd toxicity. When the KKU2500-3 strain was grown in the presence of Cd, H2S was not detected, suggesting a possible role of the sulfur in precipitation with Cd. Apart from a general response, no specific process could be determined using the present proteomic approach. However, the potential role of protein folding-mediated GroEL, flagella-mediated motility and CdS biotransformation in Cd toxicity response observed in this study as well as the extent of Cd-tolerant mechanisms using other methods could facilitate the future application of this strain in addressing Cd environmental contamination.
24634478	Polyamine oxidase 7 is a terminal catabolism-type enzyme in Oryza sativa and is specifically expressed in anthers.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Polyamine oxidase (PAO), which requires FAD as a cofactor, functions in polyamine catabolism. Plant PAOs are classified into two groups based on their reaction modes. The terminal catabolism (TC) reaction always produces 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP), H2O2, and the respective aldehydes, while the back-conversion (BC) reaction produces spermidine (Spd) from tetraamines, spermine (Spm) and thermospermine (T-Spm) and/or putrescine from Spd, along with 3-aminopropanal and H2O2. The Oryza sativa genome contains seven PAO-encoded genes termed OsPAO1-OsPAO7. To date, we have characterized four OsPAO genes. The products of these genes, i.e. OsPAO1, OsPAO3, OsPAO4 and OsPAO5, catalyze BC-type reactions. Whereas OsPAO1 remains in the cytoplasm, the other three PAOs localize to peroxisomes. Here, we examined OsPAO7 and its gene product. OsPAO7 shows high identity to maize ZmPAO1, the best characterized plant PAO having TC-type activity. OsPAO7 seems to remain in a peripheral layer of the plant cell with the aid of its predicted signal peptide and transmembrane domain. Recombinant OsPAO7 prefers Spm and Spd as substrates, and it produces DAP from both substrates in a time-dependent manner, indicating that OsPAO7 is the first TC-type enzyme identified in O. sativa. The results clearly show that two types of PAOs co-exist in O. sativa. Furthermore, OsPAO7 is specifically expressed in anthers, with an expressional peak at the bicellular pollen stage. The physiological function of OsPAO7 in anthers is discussed.
24604591	Pairwise comparison of 89Zr- and 124I-labeled cG250 based on positron emission tomography imaging and nonlinear immunokinetic modeling: in vivo carbonic anhydrase IX receptor binding and internalization in mouse xenografts of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.	2014	Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging	PURPOSE: The PET tracer, (124)I-cG250, directed against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) shows promise for presurgical diagnosis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Divgi et al. in Lancet Oncol 8:304-310, 2007; Divgi et al. in J Clin Oncol 31:187-194, 2013). The radiometal (89)Zr, however, may offer advantages as a surrogate PET nuclide over (124)I in terms of greater tumor uptake and retention (Rice et al. in Semin Nucl Med 41:265-282, 2011). We have developed a nonlinear immunokinetic model to facilitate a quantitative comparison of absolute uptake and antibody turnover between (124)I-cG250 and (89)Zr-cG250 using a human ccRCC xenograft tumor model in mice. We believe that this unique model better relates quantitative imaging data to the salient biological features of tumor antibody-antigen binding and turnover.

METHODS: We conducted experiments with (89)Zr-cG250 and (124)I-cG250 using a human ccRCC cell line (SK-RC-38) to characterize the binding affinity and internalization kinetics of the two tracers in vitro. Serial PET imaging was performed in mice bearing subcutaneous ccRCC tumors to simultaneously detect and quantify time-dependent tumor uptake in vivo. Using the known specific activities of the two tracers, the equilibrium rates of antibody internalization and turnover in the tumors were derived from the PET images using nonlinear compartmental modeling.

RESULTS: The two tracers demonstrated virtually identical tumor cell binding and internalization but showed markedly different retentions in vitro. Superior PET images were obtained using (89)Zr-cG250, owing to the more prolonged trapping of the radiolabel in the tumor and simultaneous washout from normal tissues. Estimates of cG250/CAIX complex turnover were 1.35 - 5.51 × 10(12) molecules per hour per gram of tumor (20 % of receptors internalized per hour), and the ratio of (124)I/(89)Zr atoms released per unit time by tumor was 17.5.

CONCLUSION: Pairwise evaluation of (89)Zr-cG250 and (124)I-cG250 provided the basis for a nonlinear immunokinetic model which yielded quantitative information about the binding and internalization of radioantibody bound to CAIX on tumor cells in vivo. (89)Zr-cG250 is likely to provide high-quality PET images and may be a useful tool to quantify CAIX/cG250 receptor turnover and cG250-accessible antigen density noninvasively in humans.
24584028	Characterization of epistatic interaction of QTLs LH8 and EH3 controlling heading date in rice.	2014	Sci Rep	Heading date is a critical trait for adaptation of rice to different cultivation areas and cropping seasons. We evaluated the heading dates of 1,123 chromosome segments substitution lines (CSSLs) in the genetic background of an elite rice variety Huajingxian74 (HJX74). A CSSL with the substituted segments from Zihui100 exhibited late heading under both natural long-day (NLD) and natural short-day (NSD) conditions, and the late heading phenotype was controlled by two novel epistatic loci on chromosome 8 and chromosome 3, respectively, termed LH8 and EH3. The function of EH3 was dependent on the LH8 genotype through epistatic interaction between EH3(Zihui100) and LH8(Zihui100) alleles. Genetic and molecular characterization revealed LH8 encodes a CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor with Heading date1 (Hd1)-binding activity and may delay flowering by repressing the expression of Early heading date1 (Ehd1). Our work provides a solid foundation for further study on gene interaction in heading date and has application in breeding rice with greater adaptability.
24667992	Brassinosteroid-mediated regulation of agronomic traits in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Rep	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of steroid phytohormones with wide-ranging biological activity. Genetic, genomic and proteomic studies have greatly advanced our understanding of BR signaling in Arabidopsis and revealed a connected signal transduction pathway from the cell surface receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) to the BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) family of transcription factors and their targets mediating physiological functions. However, compared with the dicot model plant Arabidopsis, much less is known about BR signaling in rice, which is a monocot. In this review, we provide an update on the progress made by BR studies in rice and discuss how BR regulates various important agronomic traits to determine rice grain yield. Specifically, we discuss the function of novel components including LEAF AND TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC), DWARF and LOW-TILLERING (DLT), DWARF1 (D1) and TAIHU DWARF1 (TUD1) in rice BR signaling, and provide a rice BR-signaling pathway model that involves a BRI1-dependent pathway as well as a G-protein α subunit-mediated signaling pathway. The recent significant advances in our understanding of BR-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying agronomic traits will be of great help for rice molecular breeding.
24485316	RNAi mediated knockdown of the ryanodine receptor gene decreases chlorantraniliprole susceptibility in Sogatella furcifera.	2014	Pestic Biochem Physiol	The diamide insecticides activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to release and deplete intracellular calcium stores from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscles and the endoplasmic reticulum of many types of cells. They rapidly interrupt feeding of the target pest and eventually kill the pest due to starvation. However, information about the structure and function of insect RyRs is still limited. In this study, we isolated a 15,985bp full-length cDNA (named SfRyR) from Sogatella furcifera, a serious rice planthopper pest throughout Asia. SfRyR encodes a 5140-amino acid protein, which shares 78-97% sequence identities with other insect homologues, and less than 50% identities with Homo sapiens RyR1-3. All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in SfRyR. In the N-terminus, SfRyR has a MIR domain, two RIH domains, three SPRY domains, four copies of RyR repeated domain and a RIH-associated domain. In the C-terminus, SfRyR possesses two consensus calcium ion-binding EF-hand motifs, and six transmembrane helices. Temporal and spatial expression analysis showed that SfRyR was widely found in all development stages including egg, first through fifth instar nymphs, macropterous adult females and males. On day 2 fifth-instar nymphs, SfRyR was ubiquitously expressed in the head, thorax and abdomen. Dietary ingestion of dsSfRyR1 and dsSfRyR2 significantly reduced the mRNA level of SfRyR in the treated nymphs by 77.9% and 81.8% respectively, and greatly decreased chlorantraniliprole-induced mortality. Thus, our results suggested that SfRyR gene encoded a functional RyR that mediates chlorantraniliprole toxicity to S. furcifera.
24726274	Light energy allocation at PSII under field light conditions: how much energy is lost in NPQ-associated dissipation?	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	In the field, plants are exposed to fluctuating light, where photosynthesis occurs under conditions far from a steady state. Excess energy dissipation associated with energy quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (qE) functions as an efficient photo-protection mechanism in photosystem II. PsbS is an important regulator of qE, especially for the induction phase of qE. Beside the regulatory energy dissipation, some part of energy is lost through relaxation of excited chlorophyll molecules. To date, several models to quantify energy loss through these dissipative pathways in PSII have been proposed. In this short review, we compare and evaluate these models for PSII energy allocation when they are applied to non-steady state photosynthesis. As a case study, an investigation on energy allocation to qE-associated dissipation at PSII under non-steady state photosynthesis using PsbS-deficient rice transformants is introduced. Diurnal and seasonal changes in PSII energy allocation in rice under natural light are also presented. Future perspective of studies on PSII energy allocation is discussed.
24488967	Multiple RNA binding protein complexes interact with the rice prolamine RNA cis-localization zipcode sequences.	2014	Plant Physiol	RNAs for the storage proteins, glutelins and prolamines, contain zipcode sequences, which target them to specific subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. Fifteen RNA binding proteins (RBPs) specifically bind to the prolamine zipcode sequences and are likely to play an important role in the transport and localization of this storage protein RNA. To understand the underlying basis for the binding of multiple protein species to the prolamine zipcode sequences, the relationship of five of these RBPs, RBP-A, RBP-I, RBP-J, RBP-K, and RBP-Q, were studied. These five RBPs, which belong to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein class, bind specifically to the 5' coding regions as well as to the 3' untranslated region zipcode RNAs but not to a control RNA sequence. Coimmunoprecipitation-immunoblot analyses in the presence or absence of ribonuclease showed that these five RBPs are assembled into three multiprotein complexes to form at least two zipcode RNA-protein assemblies. One cytoplasmic-localized zipcode assembly contained two multiprotein complexes sharing a common core consisting of RBP-J and RBP-K and either RBP-A (A-J-K) or RBP-I (I-J-K). A second zipcode assembly of possibly nuclear origin consists of a multiprotein complex containing RBP-Q and modified forms of the other protein complexes. These results suggest that prolamine RNA transport is initiated in the nucleus to form a zipcode-protein assembly, which is remodeled in the cytoplasm to target the RNA to its proper location on the cortical endoplasmic reticulum.
24507455	Grapevine microRNAs responsive to exogenous gibberellin.	2014	BMC Genomics	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), involving in various biological and metabolic processes, have been discovered and analyzed in quite a number of plants species, such as Arabidopsis, rice and other plants. However, there have been few reports about grapevine miRNAs in response to gibberelline (GA3).

RESULTS: Solexa technology was used to sequence small RNA libraries constructed from grapevine berries treated with GA3 and the control. A total of 122 known and 90 novel grapevine miRNAs (Vvi-miRNAs) were identified. Totally, 137 ones were found to be clearly responsive to GA3, among which 58 were down-regulated, 51 were up-regulated, 21 could only be detected in the control, and seven were only detected in the treatment. Subsequently, we found that 28 of them were differentially regulated by GA3, with 12 conserved and 16 novel Vvi-miRNAs, based on the analysis of qRT-PCR essays. There existed some consistency in expression levels of GA3-responsive Vvi-miRNAs between high throughput sequencing and qRT-PCR essays. In addition, 117 target genes for 29 novel miRNAs were predicted.

CONCLUSIONS: Deep sequencing of short RNAs from grapevine berries treated with GA3 and the control identified 137 GA3-responsive miRNAs, among which 28 exhibited different expression profiles of response to GA3 in the diverse developmental stages of grapevine berries. These identified Vvi-miRNAs might be involved in the grapevine berry development and response to environmental stresses.
24625559	Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice.	2014	PLoS Genet	Unlike many wild grasses, domesticated rice cultivars have uniform culm height and panicle size among tillers and the main shoot, which is an important trait for grain yield. However, the genetic basis of this trait remains unknown. Here, we report that Dwarf Tiller1 (DWT1) controls the developmental uniformity of the main shoot and tillers in rice (Oryza sativa). Most dwt1 mutant plants develop main shoots with normal height and larger panicles, but dwarf tillers bearing smaller panicles compared with those of the wild type. In addition, dwt1 tillers have shorter internodes with fewer and un-elongated cells compared with the wild type, indicating that DWT1 affects cell division and cell elongation. Map-based cloning revealed that DWT1 encodes a Wuschel-related homeobox (WOX) transcription factor homologous to the Arabidopsis WOX8 and WOX9. The DWT1 gene is highly expressed in young panicles, but undetectable in the internodes, suggesting that DWT1 expression is spatially or temporally separated from its effect on the internode growth. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell division and cell elongation, cytokinin/gibberellin homeostasis and signaling in dwt1 shorter internodes. Moreover, the non-elongating internodes of dwt1 are insensitive to exogenous gibberellin (GA) treatment, and some of the slender rice1 (slr1) dwt1 double mutant exhibits defective internodes similar to the dwt1 single mutant, suggesting that the DWT1 activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with GA signaling. This study reveals a genetic pathway synchronizing the development of tillers and the main shoot, and a new function of WOX genes in balancing branch growth in rice.
